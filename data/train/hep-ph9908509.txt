    "the constituent quark model has proven exceptionally successful in describing the properties of hadrons @xcite . nevertheless it is universally acknowledged that the quark model spectroscopic analysis is overly simplistic , in part because couplings of resonances to other hadronic states are not included . in particular , the quark model at its most basic level does not include final state interactions @xcite and the effects of coupling resonances to decay channels @xcite .",

    "although the final state interaction contributions have been studied previously in the quark model@xcite , that initial study used the fermi approximation to final state interactions , did not take into account the differences in the i=0 and i=2 potentials ( which are crucial to describing the @xmath3 final state ) , and employed rescaled pion potentials . as a result , the model of ref .",

    "equation ( 13 ) demonstrates that the isospin dependence of the @xmath9 production amplitudes is generated through the isospin dependence of the final state interactions .",
    "the fact that the isoscalar and isotensor @xmath9 interactions differ markedly causes a rotation in isospin space which is reflected in a nonzero @xmath3 amplitude ( see equation ( 15 ) ) .",

    "equation ( 15 ) reveals that the details of the neutral pion prediction depend on the scalar qed production mechanism , the isoscalar and isotensor hadronic phase shifts , and fsi - induced modifications to the outgoing pion - pion wavefunction .",

    "the s - wave elastic phase shifts produced by the @xmath9 potentials are shown as solid lines in figures 3 ( @xmath87 ) and 4 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is clear that both underestimate the strength of the @xmath9 interaction .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the majority of this discrepancy may be alleviated by employing relativistic kinematics in the description of the @xmath9 phase shift",

    "the agreement in the isotensor sector is quite good .",
    "the isoscalar prediction is still somewhat low ; however , the isoscalar sector differs from the isotensor sector in that @xmath89 annihilation will lead to resonance coupling .",
    "indeed , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that very good agreement may be achieved once the neglected effects of mixing with the @xmath90 and @xmath91 are included .",
    "since resonance coupling will also induce wavefunction effects in our problem , we have chosen to examine the importance of the phase shifts by simply fitting them .",
    "the fits are indicated as dotted lines in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the differences between the predictions for neutral pion production for the relativized model ( dashed lines ) and the fits ( dotted lines ) will be examined below .    the final contribution to",
    "the @xmath3 cross section came from the fsi - induced distortions to the pion - pion wavefunction .",
    "we shall assume that this is accurately described by our potential formalism .",
    "this may appear doubtful because the potential phase shifts did not agree well with elastic @xmath9 scattering data .",
    "however , as noted above , the majority of the discrepancy is due to the nonrelativistic phase space necessitated by the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation , rather than the potential itself .",
    "we are thus confident that the effective potentials can describe the wavefunction distortion .",
    "however , the model neglects additional distortions to the wavefunction caused by transitions to virtual resonance states ( the @xmath86 ) . for the moment",
    ", we will assume that these are small near threshold since the @xmath90 is narrow and the @xmath91 is distant .",
    "indeed , calculations with a relativistic breit - wigner yield the following cross sections for @xmath3 at threshold : 0.015 nb for @xmath90 , 0.00005 nb for @xmath92 , and 0.15 nb for @xmath93 .",
    "figure 5b shows the predicted cross section for @xmath94 along with data from three experiments .",
    "there is very little difference between predictions , indicating the lack of importance of fsi effects in the charged channel .",
    "the born result agrees fairly well with the data .",
    "the born result also agrees well with the dispersion analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath95 mev , where there is no data .",
    "the dashed line of figure 5a is the predicted cross section for @xmath3 production which is based on the relativized @xmath9 phase shift predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite and a nonrelativistic @xmath9 final state wavefunction .",
    "recall that this curve therefore does not incorporate resonance effects and does not fit the isoscalar @xmath9 scattering data well .",
    "the result presented in figure 5a agrees well with data near threshold ",
    "an indication that the near threshold neutral pion data can be explained by the postulated mechanism of final state interaction - induced isospin rotation .",
    "nevertheless , the dashed curve falls below the data by a factor of three or four above energies of 350 mev .",
    "it is therefore of interest to test the effects of intermediate resonance states .",
    "we model this by fitting the experimental s - wave @xmath9 phase shifts as described above .",
    "note that we are ignoring wavefunction distortion caused by dynamical resonance effects .",
    "the resulting prediction is given by the dotted line in figure 5a .",
    "the agreement with data is substantially improved .",
    "this is due to the increased accuracy of the description of the @xmath88 scattering data and is a strong indication that resonance effects ( as manifested in the @xmath88 phase shift ) can be important even near threshold .",
    "the agreement with experiment is not perfect ",
    "we believe that this is likely due to explicit dynamical resonance effects in the final state scattering wavefunction",
    ". it should be possible to test this assertion by including resonances in a coupled channel description of the final state interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the main point is established ",
    "it is possible to describe the rather complicated processes leading to a @xmath3 final state with a sufficiently detailed analysis of the production mechanism and the final state interactions .",
    "the reaction @xmath1 presents an interesting theoretical challenge .",
    "neutral pions do not couple directly to low energy photons so that direct techniques based on the low theorem can not be used to describe the cross section .",
    "calculations tend to be difficult ; this is illustrated by efforts in chiral perturbation theory which have found it necessary to introduce three new counterterms , work to two loops , and to unitarize .",
    "we have presented a relatively simple explanation of the data . in our model neutral pion",
    "production proceeds via charged pion production followed by final state hadronic interactions . the @xmath2 initial state is described well by the born order scalar qed amplitude , in accord with low s theorem .",
    "this amplitude is then convoluted with the final state pion - pion wavefunction to arrive at a prediction for @xmath3 production .",
    "the result for @xmath94 is very insensitive to final state interactions  a result that follows from isospin algebra and the weakness of the final state interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the prediction for @xmath3 depends crucially on the interference between @xmath88 and @xmath87 final state interactions , and is therefore driven by the well known differences in these processes  @xmath87 s - wave @xmath9 scattering is repulsive while @xmath88 is attractive .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that roughly half of the scattering strength at low energy in @xmath88 is due to the @xmath90 and @xmath91 resonances  even at threshold .",
    "this leads to the surprising conclusion that resonance coupling is important to getting the magnitude of the @xmath3 cross section correct near threshold .",
    "this calculation was undertaken with an eye to extensions to heavier systems .",
    "in particular , @xmath11 production of vector - vector states has a long , and enigmatic , history .",
    "for example , the large ratio @xmath96 is problematic and has engendered much speculation .",
    "this is due , is part , to the lack of clear theoretical guidance ",
    "chiral perturbation theory and dispersion methods are inapplicable for these processes . of course such constraints",
