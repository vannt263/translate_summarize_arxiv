    "wigner suggested in 1934 that a liquid to solid phase transition should occur in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) fermi system at low densities @xcite . the quest for the observation of such a wigner crystal has been the object of very intense and not stagnant work .",
    "after the first discovery of wigner crystallization of electrons on the surface of liquid helium @xcite , there has been considerable theoretical and experimental progress in the study of the mesoscopic system consisting of a finite number of charged particles , which are laterally confined by a parabolic potential and repel each other through a coulomb potential .",
    "this system is the classical analog of the well - known quantum dot problem .",
    "these quantum dots are atomic - like structures which have interesting optical properties and may be of interest for single electron devices .",
    "these systems and their configurations have been observed experimentally , and are important in solid - state physics , plasma physics as well as in atomic physics .",
    "the classical approach is valid for quantum dots in high magnetic fields where the kinetic energy of the electrons is quenched , or for other classical systems , such as laser cooled ions in a trap @xcite which are realized by electric and magnetic fields , trapped ions cooled by laser techniques @xcite , ions in a radio - frequency ( rf ) trap ( paul trap ) @xcite or a penning trap @xcite which can also serve as an illustration of 3d coulomb clusters @xcite .",
    "very large coulomb clusters have been created recently in strongly coupled rf dusty plasmas @xcite which are like a two - dimensional ( 2d ) layered system",
    ". examples of 2d coulomb clusters are electrons on the surface of liquid helium @xcite and electrons in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the vortex clusters in an isotropic superfluid @xcite , vortices in superfluid he@xmath0@xcite , vortices in a bose - einstein condensate stirred with a laser beam @xcite and in superconducting grains @xcite have many common features with those of 2d charged particles @xcite .",
    "colloidal particles dissolved in water @xcite and placed between two glass plates are another example of an experimental system where classical particles exhibit wigner crystallization @xcite . very recently , macroscopic",
    "2d wigner islands , consisting of charged metallic balls above a plane conductor were studied and ground state , metastable states and saddle point configurations were found experimentally @xcite .    in a finite system there is a competition between the bulk triangular lattice and the circular confinement potential which tries to force the particles into a ring like configuration .",
    "those configurations were systematically investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite and a mendeleev - type of table for these classical atomic - like structures was constructed .",
    "the spectral properties of the ground state configurations were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and generalized  to screened coulomb @xcite and logarithmic @xcite interparticle interactions .    in the present paper",
    "we want to go one major step further and calculate not only all the different metastable states but also the saddle points between those local energy minima and the path followed by the particles to transit between those energy minima .",
    "the present work is motivated by recent experimental work @xcite where it was found that : i ) some of the configurations did not agree with the previous theoretical published one , and ii ) they were able to observe some of the saddle points which are the key configurations for transition between different stable ( ground or metastable ) states .",
    "therefore , we also investigated the stability of the ground state configurations against the functional form of the confinement potential and the exact form of the inter - particle interaction potential .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we describe the model system . in sec .",
    "3 , our numerical technique , used to obtain the ground and metastable states , is outlined .",
    "the technique we used to find the saddle point is similar to the cerjan - miller algorithm @xcite . after the saddle points are found , we connect the saddle point to the global minimum or a local minimum by the ` walking downhill ' method .",
    "is devoted to the structural and static properties of the ground and metastable states for @xmath1 .",
    "the configurations are analyzed and compared with available experimental data and the results of previous theoretical approaches . the phase diagram for 9 and 16 particles in the ground state with different functional forms of confinement potential and interparticle interaction",
    "is also calculated .",
    "the discussion on the saddle point is presented in sec",
    ". 5 , and the connecting path from the ground state to the metastable states is found , and we investigate the completely geometric properties of the energy landscape .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the model system consists of identical charged particles interacting through a coulomb repulsive interacting and moving in a 2d plane where they are confined by a parabolic potential @xmath2 the confinement potential @xmath3 is taken circular symmetric and parabolic , where @xmath4 is the effective mass of the particles , @xmath5 is the particle charge , @xmath6 is the radial confinement frequency and @xmath7 is the dielectric constant of the medium the particles are moving in . note that for the quantum dot problem an additional term appears in eq .",
    "( 1 ) which is the kinetic energy of the particles which is absent in our statical classical problem . here",
    "the motion of the particles is restricted to the @xmath8 plane . to exhibit the scaling of the system",
    ", we introduce the characteristic scales in the problem : @xmath9 for the length and @xmath10 for the energy . after the scaling transformations ( @xmath11 )",
    ", the hamiltonian can be rewritten in a simple dimensionless form as    @xmath12    with @xmath13 and which only depends on the number of particles @xmath14 .",
    "the numerical values for the parameters @xmath15 for some typical experimental systems were given in ref .",
    "most of the previous works have treated the quantum mechanical problem of a small number of electrons . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider only the classical system .",
    "although a classical approach for the description of the behavior of electrons in quantum dots , in principle , is not applicable , it is possible that certain features of the classical system may survive in a quantum system .    due to the presence of confinement energy and electron - electron coulombic interaction , a complete description of the cluster system",
    "is complicated and ca nt be obtained analytically .",
    "the monte carlo simulation technique @xcite is relatively simple and rapidly convergent and it provides a reliable estimation of the total energy of the system in cases when relatively small number of metropolis steps is sufficient .",
    "however , the accuracy of this method in calculating the explicit states is poor in certain cases .",
    "it becomes more difficult for clusters with a large number of particles , which have significantly more metastable states . to circumvent this problem",
    "we employ the numerical technique of newton optimization which was outlined and compared with the standard monte carlo technique in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this way , we are able to obtain not only the ground state but also metastable states",
    ". it also yields the eigenfrequencies and the eigenmodes of the ground state configuration .",
    "now only a small number of calculation steps is needed to obtain the same accuracy . moreover , using the modified newton approach , we can explore the stability of the system in its ground - state configuration through its spectrum .    by studying the characteristics of the energy landscape and the energy barrier between the different local minima , we are able to find the saddle point configurations which are very important and are the key configurations for transition between different stable states .",
    "the technique we used to find the saddle point is explained in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is similar to the cerjan - miller algorithm @xcite . after the saddle points are found , we connect the saddle point to the global minimum or a local minimum by the ` walking downhill ' method . in this algorithm",
    "the direction of the steepest gradient is followed to force the system to transit from the saddle point state to the local minimum state . which minimum is finally reached depends on the initial step",
    ", therefore we repeat this procedure several times to determine both minima which the saddle point state connects .",
    "thus the connecting path followed by the particles to transit between those energy minima is found , from which the geometric properties of the energy landscape are obtained .",
    "in table [ tab1 ] we list for @xmath14=1 , 2, ... ,40 the energy per particle @xmath16 in the ground state and in the metastable states , where we also list the energy difference with the ground state @xmath17 the configuration is indicated by the number of particles in the different rings , the position of the center of the ring and the radius of the different rings , the width of the ring which is defined as the difference of the maximum radius and minimum radius in the same ring , and the energy of the lowest three normal mode frequencies of the ground state are also given in table i. this table is rather exhaustive and should be compared with a similar one published in ref .",
    "@xcite for a logarithmic interacting system",
    ".    for different values of @xmath14 there exist different possible values for @xmath16 which are nothing else than the metastable states .",
    "the difference in energy between the metastable and the ground state is given in the third column and the corresponding configuration in the fourth column .",
    "note that with increasing @xmath14 the number of metastable configurations increases and in general ( but not always ) the widths of the rings for metastable configurations are larger and the central ring / particle is not exactly located in the center of the parabolic potential well . for sufficiently large @xmath14 , the simple ring structure gradually disappears in the center and the triangular wigner lattice appears .",
    "there is a competition between two types of ordering : ordering into a triangular - lattice structure ( wigner lattice ) and ordering into a shell structure , which leads to clusters with interesting self - organized patterns which show concentric shells at small @xmath14 and hexagonal cores surrounded by circular outer shells at large @xmath14 .",
    "the lowest non - zero normal mode frequency is a measure for the stability of the ground state , it tells us how easy or difficult it is to deform this state .",
    "therefore , intuitively we would expect that the value of this frequency would be correlated to @xmath18 , the energy difference between the first metastable and the ground state .",
    "those values are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as function of @xmath14 .",
    "notice that there exist such a correlation in general , but that this is not true for all @xmath14-values , e.g. for @xmath19 there is no correlation .",
    "the rings have sometimes a finite width which are shown in fig . [ fig2 ] as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "notice that the widths fall into three bands ; i ) width @xmath20 0.003 which is practically a perfect ring , ii ) width @xmath21 0.02 , and iii ) width @xmath22 0.5 .",
    "usually , but not always , the outer ring has the largest width .",
    "the width of the rings increases with increasing @xmath14 and at the same time the widest ring becomes often the next to outer ring .",
    "we compare our ground state configuration with available experimental data @xcite and the results of previous theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "for very small number of particles ( @xmath23 ) , all theoretical and experimental results for the ground state configurations are the same expect for @xmath14=9 and 15 whatever kind of interparticle interaction .",
    "the experimental observation @xcite for the ground state of 9 particles is ( 1,8 ) and for 15 particles it is ( 4,11 ) , which compares to our result ( 2,7 ) and ( 5,10 ) , respectively .",
    "for @xmath24 the experimental result and all the calculated patterns present three shells .",
    "our result differs with the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath14= 17 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 27 - 30 .",
    "because of the discrepancy between some of the experimental configurations and the ` numerical exact ' theoretical ground state configurations it is possible that experimentally the inter - particle interaction is not exactly a coulombic potential and the confinement potential is not purely quadratic . therefore , we investigated the effect of such deviations of these potentials on the ground state configuration .",
    "as an example we took @xmath14=9 and use confinement potentials @xmath25 and for the inter - particle interaction @xmath26 . the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "notice that , depending on the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 the system can be either in the ( 1,8 ) or the ( 2,7 ) configuration .",
    "for the harmonic confined coulomb interacting system i.e. ( @xmath29 ) = ( 2,1 ) the system is in the ( 2,7 ) configuration but from the phase diagram it is clear that if we change the confinement potential slightly and make it more steep up to @xmath302.2 the configuration ( 1,8 ) becomes the ground state .",
    "the experimentally determined ground state configuration for 9 particles was ( 1,8 ) [ 24 ] .",
    "there is also a difference with the experimental data and our results for @xmath14=16 particles .",
    "therefore , we did the same investigation and present the phase diagram in fig .",
    "notice that the harmonic confined coulomb interacting system , i.e. @xmath31 = ( 2,1 ) is again close to the phase boundary between the configuration ( 1,5,10 ) and ( 5,11 ) .",
    "this is probably the explanation why the experimental configuration@xcite differs from our simulation results , since it is hard to guarantee that ( @xmath29 ) is exactly ( 2,1 ) during the experiment .",
    "notice that for both @xmath14=9 and @xmath14=16 the metastable configuration has an energy very close to the one of the ground state , the difference is less than 0.2@xmath32 .",
    "these metastable configurations correspond indeed with the experimentally observed ones .",
    "consequently , an alternative explanation for the difference with the experiment is that the experimental configuration got stuck in the metastable configuration .",
    "between metastable states and the ground state there are potential barriers",
    ". the system will prefer to transfer over the lowest potential barrier , which is the saddle point configuration between these energy minima , in order to transit from one stable configuration to the other .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the trajectories of the particles for the @xmath14=5 system making a transition from the ground state ( 5 ) to the metastable state ( 1,4 ) and the saddle point connecting them .",
    "the trajectories of the particles can also be obtained by moving one of the particles to the center of the system .    for 6 particles , the ground state ( 1,5 ) and the metastable state ( 6 ) , corresponding to the hexagonal configuration ,",
    "are obtained .",
    "moreover , the unstable equilibria associated to saddle point configurations are also obtained , and the energy landscape is shown schematically  in fig .",
    "there are two saddle points for this case , one of them is very close to the metastable state in both energy and configuration , and will therefore be hard to see experimentally @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the insets show the arrangement of the particles for the different states . using the ` walking downhill method ' , we found the central particle slowly moving to the periphery of the cluster .",
    "we would like to stress that the configuration with 6 particles on a perfect ring is a saddle point state in contrast to the claim  made in ref .",
    "this can be understood from the following simple model calculation : if 3 particles are placed on a circle with radius @xmath33 , on the corners of an equilateral triangle , and the other 3 particles on another equilateral triangle s corners with radius @xmath34 rotated over @xmath35 , the energy is @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "this function is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that the perfect circle configuration i.e. @xmath38 is a saddle point , and that the minimum is obtained if 3 particles move a bit to the center , and the other 3 particles move away from the center ( see the insets in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "both shown metastable states are just connected by a rotation over @xmath39 .",
    "the two minima in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] correspond to the same configuration in which inner and outer ring are interchanged . comparing our results with the fig . 2 ( ` @xmath40 : ground state , saddle point configuration and the hexagonal metastable state ' ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that the other saddle point is observed experimentally .",
    "a list of the saddle point energies up to 20 particles is given in table [ tab2 ] . from this table , we notice that there is only one saddle point state for @xmath41 particles .",
    "but , on the other hand it is well - known that there are @xmath42 saddle points when there are @xmath43 minima . for @xmath14=3 and 4 one saddle point",
    "is found , although there is no metastable configuration .",
    "the reason is that the saddle point state connects two equilateral ground state configurations which can be obtained from each other by a simple rotation . for the simple case of 3 particles ,",
    "we show the energy surface and the corresponding configurations schematically in fig .",
    "notice that there are always more saddle points than minima for @xmath146 . with increasing the number of particles ,",
    "more saddle point states are obtained and the energy landscape gets more complicated .",
    "for example for 9 particles , we obtain three saddle points and one metastable state .",
    "the results for the trajectories and energy landscape are shown in fig .",
    "again , the ground state configurations corresponding with the black and the white dot are connected by a simple rotation , i. e. a symmetry operation .",
    "we presented the results of a numerical calculation of the configurations of the ground and all metastable states and their energies , the system consisting of classical 2d charged particles that are confined in a parabolic confinement potential for @xmath14=1, ... ,40 .",
    "these artificial atoms undergo configurational changes when the system transits from the ground state to the different metastable states , or between the different metastable states .",
    "such transitions move through the lowest energy barrier connecting those states , i. e. through a saddle point .",
    "the connecting path from the ground state to all metastable states is found and the geometric properties of the energy landscape were discussed .",
    "sensitivity of the configuration on the form of the confinement potential and the interparticle interaction is investigated and a phase diagram was obtained .",
    "this sensitivity on e.g. the form of the confinement potential is probably the explanation why the experimental configuration@xcite differs from our simulation results .",
