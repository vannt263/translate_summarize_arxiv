    "recently , graphene monolayers have attracted much attention motivated by their unusual twodimensional ( 2d ) dirac energy spectrum of electrons . in graphite , which is a graphene multilayer composed of weakly coupled graphene sheets , the interlayer interaction converts the 2d electron energy spectrum of graphen into the three - dimensional ( 3d ) spectrum of graphite .",
    "the application of the tilted magnetic field is a typical method to distinguish between 2d and 3d electron systems , as in 3d systems the orbital effect of the in - plane magnetic field should be observable .",
    "this problem has been touched in two recent theoretical studies of the graphene multilayer energy spectrum in magnetic fields parallel to the layers @xcite , and of the landau levels ( lls ) of bilayer graphene in magnetic fields of arbitrary orientation @xcite .",
    "both papers conclude that the very strong in - plane field components are necessary to induce observable effects on the electronic structure . here",
    "we show that at the h point of the hexagonal brillouin zone of graphite the application of the tilted magnetic field leads to experimentally observable splitting of lls .",
    "bulk graphite is composed of periodically repeated graphene bilayers formed by two nonequivalent bernal - stacked graphene sheets .",
    "there are two sublattices , a and b , on each sheet and , therefore , four atoms in a unit cell .",
    "the distance between the nearest atoms a and b in a single layer is @xmath0  , the interlayer distance between nearest atoms a is @xmath1 .    to describe the graphite band structure",
    ", we employ the minimal nearest - neighbor tight - binding model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and successfully applied in refs .",
    "the wave functions are expressed via four orthogonal components @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , which are , in zero magnetic field , bloch sums of atomic wave functions over the lattice sites of sublattices a and b in individual layers .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath6 includes only the intralayer interaction @xmath7 between nearest atoms a and b in the plane , and the interlayer interaction @xmath8 between nearest atoms a out of plane .",
    "the continuum approximation is used in the vicinity of the @xmath9 axis of the graphite brillouin zone , for small @xmath10 measured from the axis . then the electron wavelength is larger than the distance between atoms , and the non - zero matrix elements of @xmath6 can be written as @xmath11 the fermi velocity , @xmath12 , is defined by @xmath13 and will be used as an intralayer parameter instead of @xmath14 in the subsequent consideration .",
    "when solving the schrdinger equation for the above four wave functions , we can make use of the structure of @xmath6 , which allows to express the function @xmath18 via the function @xmath19 from the same layer , and leaves us with two , , interlayer ",
    "equations for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "note , that graphite is no longer periodic in the @xmath21-direction ( parallel to the @xmath22-axis ) but becomes periodic in the direction of the tilted magnetic field .",
    "here we apply an approach developed in @xcite .",
    "the new periodicity implies that @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24 @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 can be associated with cyclotron orbits in two layers .",
    "the dimensionless variable @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cyclotron orbit center , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the magnetic length , @xmath33 .",
    "the small parameter @xmath34 means the shift of the cyclotron orbit center in the @xmath35-layer due to the in - plane component of the magnetic field , @xmath36 . introducing the shift operator by @xmath37 and employing @xmath38-representation , two ,",
    ", interlayer  equations can be given the form @xmath39 \\phi_2^a+ 2 t\\ , e\\cos{(\\kappa\\eta_d+k_zd ) } \\phi_1^a=   0 , \\label{eq1tt }   \\\\ \\label{main - eq2 } \\left[\\frac{\\mathcal{b}}{2}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\kappa^2 } + \\kappa^2 -1\\right)-e^2\\right ] \\phi_1^a+ 2 t\\ , e\\cos{(\\kappa\\eta_d+k_zd ) } \\phi_2^a =   0,\\label{eq2tt } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 stands for @xmath41 .",
    "( [ main - eq1],[main - eq2 ] ) represent the main result of this work .",
    "it is evident that @xmath42 and @xmath43 can not be too far from the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath44 .",
    "if we write @xmath45 we arrive to @xmath46 a_{2,n}+ 2 e \\sum_{n'=0}^{\\infty}t_{n , n'}a_{1,n'}=0,\\label{eq1p } \\\\",
    "\\left[\\mathcal{b}n - e^2\\right ] a_{1,n}+ 2 e \\sum_{n'=0}^{\\infty}t_{n , n'}a_{2,n'}=0,\\label{eq2p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47    in the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this corresponds to the previously discussed case @xcite . at the @xmath50 point ,",
    "@xmath51 , we get the energy spectrum of an effective bilayer . at the @xmath52 point ,",
    "@xmath53 , the coupling between layers disappears , and we obtain the lls corresponding to graphene dirac fermions , namely @xmath54 for the first layer , and @xmath55 for the second layer , @xmath56 .",
    "let us discuss the magnetic field of an arbitrary direction .",
    "it is obvious that the influence of the small parameter @xmath57 is negligible at the point k when @xmath51 and @xmath58 .",
    "this case corresponds to the bilayer subject to the tilted field discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the result that corrections induced by @xmath36 are negligible .",
    "let us consider the influence of @xmath36 at the h point , when @xmath59 and @xmath60 . then , unlike the case of the perpendicular field , the interlayer interaction is not reduced to zero , but remains finite .",
    "note , that the small perturbation @xmath57 couples the unperturbed states @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which belong to the same unperturbed eigenvalues @xmath63 .",
    "consequently , the perturbation approach suitable to describe the coupling of these degenerated states must be applied , which yields equations @xmath64 a_{2,n}+2 e t_{n , n+1 } a_{1,n+1}=0,\\label{eq1pp } \\\\",
