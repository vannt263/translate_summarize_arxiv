    "quantum entanglement , that stands for the intrinsic nonlocal correlations inherent in the quantum theory , plays a crucial role in the understanding of the fundamentals of quantum physics as well as serves as the key resource for implementing practical applications within the field of quantum technologies . specifically , entanglement is vital to diverse secure quantum communication and teleportation schemes @xcite and is at the heart of quantum computation , quantum metrology , quantum imaging @xcite , etc .",
    "various protocols , applicable to continuous- and discrete - variable systems have been proposed recently , allowing one to generate entanglement shared between quantum memories @xcite and encoded in states of light fields @xcite or , alternatively , to create systems of strongly entangled superconducting or cavity qed qubits , quantum dots , highly excited rydberg atoms @xcite , etc . meanwhile ,",
    "solid - state systems and , particularly , magnetic materials , are of significant importance in this respect as they appear to be a source of entanglement too , even on a macroscopic level @xcite .",
    "furthermore , entanglement turns out to be a powerful tool here for the characterization of quantum phase transitions as it encodes all the information shared between subparts of a system that may fail to be captured by means of ordinary correlation functions ( this can be the case in some exotic quantum ground states @xcite ) . in this respect ,",
    "spin models are widely used to describe the properties of such solid - state systems where intercoupled ( e.g. , by means of the heisenberg exchange interaction ) spins are nested in the sites of a specific lattice structure .",
    "the entanglement features of various spin - lattice models of this kind have been thoroughly studied recently @xcite , revealing , particularly , a strong connection of magnetic properties and entanglement @xcite that allows one to witness the latter experimentally ( e.g. , by means of heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements @xcite ) .    meanwhile , another intriguing question that we address in this paper , is the connection of quantum entanglement and chaos .",
    "as is known , the latter also plays an important role in various areas of research , and particularly in the field of quantum information .",
    "for instance , the uncontrolled interactions between the qubits of a quantum computer , being above some critical strength , induce chaotic behavior that may break down the efficiency of the computer or bring about exponential decay of the entanglement @xcite .",
    "consequently , the complexity of error correction codes increases and the correction time , however , is independent of whether the system is chaotic or not @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", quantum chaos may also ensue in specific quantum protocols , such as the grover s search algorithm , or quantum fourier transform , giving rise to a peculiar combination of quantum signatures of chaos and integrability @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , another suitable platform for the combined studies of entanglement and chaotic behavior is nonlinear dissipative oscillators @xcite and so - called coupled tops @xcite , where the underlying classical chaos may enhance and determine the amount of the entanglement shared between the coupled systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum signatures of chaotic behavior in a kicked top have been demonstrated for trapped caesium atoms , showing that if prepared in the chaotic sea , the electron and nuclear spins of the atoms get rapidly entangled @xcite .",
    "finally , some other studies , e.g. , for @xmath0-atom jaynes - cummings model have also shown that the entanglement rate is considerably enhanced for chaotic initial conditions @xcite .",
    "on our part we propose a specific spin - lattice model to study the relation among its chaotic behavior , entanglement , and magnetic properties . specifically , the structure that we consider is of recursive nature and consists of two non - equivalent types of sites : the nodal ones that constitute a husimi tree , and trimeric units that form embedded triangles [ see fig .",
    "[ lattice](a ) ] .",
    "being constructed in such a way , it is thus natural to call this structure a triangulated husimi tree and its deep interior a triangulated husimi lattice ( thl ) ( we note that a similar system has been proposed very recently in ref .",
    "next , taking into account that the rigorous treatment of purely heisenberg models are mostly unattainable , we adopt here a spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on a thl such that the ising spins are nested on the nodal sites of the lattice , while the heisenberg variables are situated on the vertices of the embedded triangles .",
    "a distinguishable feature of this model is that it can be solved exactly by combining the generalized star - triangle transformation @xcite and the recursive method @xcite .",
    "even more , if three - site interactions between nodal ising spins are included , the model exhibits chaotic behavior ( this is rather different from the case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where only two - site interactions are considered in the absence of the external magnetic field ) .",
    "although this fact has been well known for an ising model on a simple husimi lattice @xcite , it brings about drastic changes in the properties of the heisenberg trimer of the thl .",
    "namely , at sufficiently low temperatures , its magnetization , and even more interestingly , the entanglement ( that we quantify by means of the concurrence @xcite ) exhibit period - doubling bifurcations , chaotic behavior , and periodic windows .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the ground state of the heisenberg triangle remains rigid and that it is the ising sublattice ( to which the triangles are coupled ) that gives rise to chaos .",
    "furthermore , as is shown below , the spin - spin entanglement of the triangle may be slightly enhanced by means of the underlying chaotic behavior when compared to the case of only three qubits in an external magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that quantum correlations can not be induced solely by chaos and that these two are rather interconnected : chaos ensues when the entangled @xmath1 state becomes a ground state of the heisenberg trimer .",
    "finally , we note that the husimi structure , which we study here , is a good approximation to more realistic models with multisite interactions on ordinary lattices , being more reliable than the standard bethe and mean - field approaches @xcite .",
    "additionally , it can be used for the description of various polymers , and particularly , of rna - like molecules @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , triangulated lattices , in their turn , are also of current great interest since they may describe real materials ( e.g. , copper based coordination compounds @xmath2 ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xcite ) , and additionally turn out to be an efficient ground for the understanding of specific mechanisms of quantum ordering at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "consequently , along with the aforementioned features , these arguments reinforce our interest in the studies of exactly solvable ising - heisenberg models on triangulated husimi structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "moreover , the region of the chaotic entanglement is directly related to the strength of the three - site interactions @xmath60 the stronger are these interactions , the wider is the chaotic region .",

    "furthermore , chaos does not induce entanglement by itself , but may enhance ( or reduce ) its amount from shell to shell . specifically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ conchaos](b ) , the chaotic entanglement is dominantly stronger than that of just three qubits in an external magnetic field ( compare the full blue and dashed red curves therein ) .    furthermore , an important observation is that the lyapunov @xmath122 exponent [ eq .",

    "we proposed a multisite interaction spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on a triangulated husimi lattice to study the effects of chaos and bifurcation on the system s entanglement features .",
    "we used the generalized star - triangle transformation to map the initial model onto an effective ising one on a simple husimi lattice , which we then solved by means of the recursive method .",
    "an exact formula was obtained for the concurrence , to quantify the pairwise spin - spin entanglement of the embedded heisenberg triangles , expressed through the system s single - site magnetization and spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "we have shown that at relatively high temperatures and weak ising - to - heisenberg coupling , the model exhibits quite usual magnetic behavior and its entanglement properties are analogous to that of just three intercoupled qubits .",
    "however , one finds drastic changes in the properties of the system as the temperature @xmath29 is decreased .",
    "namely , period doubling of per - site ising and heisenberg magnetizations appears such that the corresponding values interchange one with another from shell to shell ( this corresponds to a bifurcation point of the mapping that describes our model ) .",
    "we interpret this behavior as a rise of a sublattice structure , that affects the system s entanglement properties , too : the concurrence now exhibits period doubling as well , and each of the two values of the entanglement is related to a particular magnetic sublattice . in other words , here every branch of the concurrence corresponds to a specific branch of the ising and heisenberg single - site magnetizations .",
    "on the other hand , with the further decrease in the temperature , we find a full - period doubling cascade , and eventually a transition to a chaotic phase where the sequence of the entanglement ( and magnetization ) values is aperiodic and does not repeat itself .",
    "importantly , this behavior appears due to the inclusion of three - site interactions @xmath60 the system is always periodic when only pair interactions are taken into account .",
    "it is also interesting to note that chaos ensues in the region of incipient magnetic and concurrence plateaus , that correspond to the entangled @xmath1 ground state .",
    "additionally , chaotic behavior is absent if the system exhibits only thermal entanglement ( in the absence of the magnetic field ) , i.e. , if its ground state is separable , which , therefore , along with the above argument , points to a connection of ground - state entanglement and chaos .",
    "moreover , although chaos does not induce entanglement by itself , it however may slightly enhance the latter ( somewhat similar results , namely entanglement enhancement for chaotic initial conditions , have been also indicated , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , although within distinct mechanisms for the chaos development ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that both for @xmath113-periodic ( @xmath143 ) and for the chaotic regimes the ground state of the heisenberg trimer is rigid , whereas the ising sublattice , that is ( weakly ) coupled to the heisenberg triangles , induces the underlying complex behavior .",
    "consequently , at sufficiently low temperatures the entanglement ( as well as the magnetization ) of the heisenberg spins exhibits a rich phase structure , including the above mentioned @xmath113-periodic phases , chaos and @xmath115-periodic windows ( @xmath142 ) , as well as various superstable cycles , that we have also confirmed by the studies of the lyapunov @xmath122 exponent .",
    "the above transitions between periodic phases occur through doubling bifurcations , whereas back and forth transitions from chaos to periodic windows happen through tangent bifurcations , that we plan to study in more detail in our future works .",
    "finally , we emphasize that for the explicit studies of the chaotic behavior of the above spin model and specifically , the chaotic pairwise entanglement of its heisenberg trimer , we have mainly used the lyapunov exponent approach .",
    "the latter allows one to differentiate rigorously between periodic and chaotic regimes and to measure the strength of the emerging chaos . in this respect ,",
    "our choice of the lyapunov exponent characteristics has been particularly reinforced by the fact that the properties of the present spin model ( and its state in the thermodynamic limit ) are defined by a one - dimensional recursive mapping .",
    "as is known , in such a case the lyapunov @xmath122 exponent serves as a strong tool for the analysis of the inherent chaotic ( as well as periodic ) regimes @xcite , and moreover , for the model that we studied here , it characterizes the chaotic behavior not only of the system s magnetic , but also of its entanglement features .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that for a deeper understanding of the relation between entanglement and chaos , apart from the lyapunov exponent studies , one would necessitate here additional analysis , as , e.g. , the estimation of the ergodicity of wave functions and level spacing statistics , quantum purity of the emerging mixed @xmath91 states , etc .",
