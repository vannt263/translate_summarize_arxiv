    "( here the constant in the @xmath182 notation depends on @xmath17 . )    to ensure that the outerface would not intersect the interior of @xmath17 , we add @xmath167 more points to @xmath152 which are far , outside of @xmath17 , and form a reflected copy of @xmath17 . this way these @xmath167 points will be the vertices of the outerface .    in the delaunay triangulation of @xmath152",
    "the inner faces are triangles , with a homothet of @xmath17 covering each triangle not containing any point of @xmath152 in its interior .",
    "further , if any of these homothets would extend beyond @xmath17 , then it would contain an added point in its interior , as each of them touches at least one point @xmath65 .",
    "using euler s formula , there are @xmath183 vertices and thus at most @xmath183 faces .",
    "each inner face is a triangle which can be covered by a homothet of @xmath17 not containing any point of @xmath152 in its interior .    finally , we prove theorem [ thm : quadrangle ] , which states that even for a quadrangle we may need many points . for",

    "we define @xmath171 and @xmath172 as in the previous proof ( see figure [ fig : quadrangle ] ) .",
    "evidently , in the self - cover of @xmath30 , the points of @xmath194 can only be covered by homothetic copies of @xmath30 whose upper edge touches or is below @xmath77 , thus have height at most @xmath193 .",
    "the length of the top edge of such a @xmath195 is thus also at most @xmath193 and thus the length of its bottom edge is at most @xmath196 .",

    "thus to cover the points of @xmath194 we need at least @xmath198 such homothets .",
    "now if instead of one , we put @xmath14 points very close to the bottom edge , but far from each other , then for each point we need @xmath199 homothets to cover the respective segment on the boundary of @xmath30 , thus altogether we need at least @xmath200 homothets , as claimed .",

    "it was also shown recently by kovcs @xcite that this result can not be extended to other polygons , as for any @xmath13 and any non - triangle polygon @xmath17 there is an @xmath13-fold covering of the plane with homothets of @xmath17 that does not decompose into @xmath101 coverings .",
