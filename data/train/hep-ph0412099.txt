    "our understanding of neutrinos has changed tremendously in the past six years .",
    "thanks to the efforts of several neutrino oscillation studies of solar , atmospheric and reactor ( anti)neutrinos , we learned that neutrinos produced in a well defined flavor eigenstate can be detected , after propagating a macroscopic distance , as a different flavor eigenstate .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this phenomenon is that , like all charged fermions the neutrinos have mass and that , similar to quarks , the neutrino weak , or flavor , eigenstates are different from neutrino mass eigenstates , i.e. , neutrinos mix @xcite .",
    "this new state of affairs has also raised many other issues which did not exist for massless neutrinos : for example , ( i ) massive neutrinos can have nonzero magnetic moments , like the electron and the quarks ; ( ii ) the heavier neutrinos may decay into lighter ones , like charged leptons and quarks , and ( iii ) ( most importantly ) the neutrinos can be either majorana or dirac fermions @xcite .    learning about all these possibilities can not only bring our knowledge of neutrinos to the same level as that of charged leptons and quarks , but may also lead to a plethora of laboratory as well as astrophysical and cosmological consequences with far reaching implications .",
    "most importantly , knowing neutrino properties in detail may also play a crucial role in clarifying the blueprint of new physical laws beyond those embodied in the standard model .",
    "one may also consider the possibility that there could be new neutrino species beyond the three known ones @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to being a question whose answer would be a revolutionary milestone pointing to unexpected new physics , it may also become a necessity if the lsnd results are confirmed by the miniboone experiment , now in progress at fermilab .",
    "this would , undoubtedly , be a second revolution in our thinking about neutrinos and the nature of unification .",
    "the existence of neutrino masses qualifies as the first evidence of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the answers to the neutrino - questions mentioned above will add substantially to our knowledge about the precise nature of this new physics , and in turn about the nature of new forces beyond the standard model .",
    "they also have the potential to unravel some of the deepest and long - standing mysteries of cosmology and astrophysics , such as the origin of matter , the origin of the heavy elements , and , perhaps , even the nature of dark energy .",
    "active endeavors are under way to launch the era of precision neutrino measurement science ( pnms ) , that will surely broaden the horizon of our knowledge about neutrinos .",
    "we undertake this survey to pin down how different experimental results expected in the coming decades can elucidate the nature of neutrinos and our quest for new physics . in particular , we would like to know ( i ) the implications of neutrinos for such long standing ideas as grand unification , supersymmetry , extra dimensions , etc ; ( ii ) the implications of the possible existence of additional neutrino species for physics and cosmology , and ( iii ) whether neutrinos have anything to do with the origin of the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe and , if so , whether there is any way to determine this via low - energy experiments . once the answers to these questions are at hand , we will have considerably narrowed the choices of new physics , providing a giant leap in our understanding of the physical universe .",
    "the purpose of this document is to briefly summarize what we know about neutrino masses and mixings , their context in overall physics , their connection to theoretical models , and open questions .",
    "there is a companion document ( `` theory white paper '' ) where further technical details are presented .",
    "neutrinos are elementary particles with spin 1/2 , electrically neutral , and obey fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "even though their existence has been known since the 1950s and the existence of three types of them was experimentally confirmed in the 1990s , it has been difficult to study their intrinsic properties due to their weak interactions . nonetheless , they have rather unique roles in the world of elementary particles .",
    "they are ubiquitous in our universe , provide a unique window to physics at very short distances , and may even be relevant to the question `` why do we exist ? '' moreover , the history of neutrinos has been full of surprises , which is likely to continue in the future .",
    "neutrinos are the most ubiquitous matter particles in the universe .",
    "they were produced in the big bang , when universe was so dense that neutrinos , despite their only weak interactions , were in thermal equilibrium with all other particle species .",
    "similarly to the cosmic microwave background photons , their number density has been diluted by the expansion of the universe . in comparison , constituents of ordinary matter , electrons , protons , and neutrons , are far rarer than photons and neutrinos , by about a factor of ten billions .",
    "it is clear that we need to understand neutrinos in order to understand our universe .    in terms of energy density ,",
    "the yet unknown dark matter and dark energy dominate the universe .",
    "if neutrinos were massless , their energy density could have been completely negligible in our current universe",
    ". however , in the last several years , we learned that neutrinos have small but finite masses , implying that the neutrinos contribute to the total energy of the universe at least as much as all stars combined .",
    "we do not yet know the mass of neutrinos precisely , and they may in fact be a sizable fraction of dark matter .",
    "the precise amount of the neutrino component is relevant to the way galaxies and stars were formed during the evolution of the universe .",
    "neutrinos are an important part of the stellar dynamics ; without them , stars would not shine .",
    "there are about @xmath1 neutrinos from the sun reaching ( and streaming through ) the earth .",
    "they also govern the dynamics of supernovae .",
    "one way to characterize physics is an attempt to understand nature at its most fundamental level , namely at the shortest distance scales , or equivalently the highest energy scales , possible .",
    "there has been two approaches .",
    "one way to access physics at the highest energy scales possible is to build powerful particle accelerators and reach the energy scale directly .",
    "another way is to look for rare effects from physics at high - energy scales that do not occur from physics at known energy scales , namely the standard model .",
    "physics of neutrino mass ( currently ) belongs to the second category .",
    "rare effects from physics beyond the standard model are parameterized by effective operators added to the standard model lagrangian , @xmath2 the effects in @xmath3 are suppressed by a single power of the high energy scale , @xmath4 by two powers , etc .",
    "the possible terms have been classified systematically by weinberg , and there are many terms suppressed by two powers : @xmath5 the examples here contribute to proton decay , @xmath6 , the anomalous triple gauge boson vertex , @xmath7@xmath8 mixing , and the @xmath9-parameter , respectively .",
    "it is interesting that there is only one operator suppressed by a single power , @xmath10 . after substituting the expectation value of the higgs ,",
    "the lagrangian becomes @xmath11 nothing but the neutrino mass .",
    "therefore the neutrino mass plays a very unique role .",
    "it is the lowest - order effect of physics at short distances .",
    "this is an extremely small effect .",
    "any kinematical effects of the neutrino mass are suppressed by @xmath12 , and for @xmath13  ev ( which we now know is already too large ) and @xmath14  gev for typical accelerator - based neutrino experiments , it is as small as @xmath15 . at first sight , there is no hope to probe such a small number .",
    "however , any physicist knows that interferometry is a sensitive method to probe extremely small effects . for interferometry to work , we need a coherent source .",
    "fortunately there are many coherent sources of neutrinos : the sun , cosmic rays , reactors , etc .",
    "we also need interference for an interferometer to work .",
    "fortunately , there are large mixing angles that make the interference possible .",
    "we also need long baselines to enhance the tiny effects . again",
    "fortunately there are many long baselines available , such as the size of the sun , the size of the earth , etc .",
    "nature was very kind to provide all the necessary conditions for interferometry to us !",
    "neutrino interferometry , a.k.a .",
    "neutrino oscillation , is a unique tool to study physics at very high energy scales .    at the currently accessible energy scale of about a hundred gev in accelerators ,",
    "the electromagnetic , weak , and strong forces have very different strengths .",
    "but their strengths become the same at @xmath16  gev if there the standard model is extended to become supersymmetric . given this ,",
    "a natural candidate energy scale for new physics is @xmath17  gev , which suggests @xmath18  ev .",
    "curiously , the data suggest numbers quite close to this expectation .",
    "therefore neutrino oscillation experiments may be probing physics at the energy scale of grand unification .",
    "gev , compared to the suggested scale of new physics from the neutrino oscillation data.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      even though some may argue that the neutrino mass was observed with the theoretically expected order of magnitude , it is fair to say that we had not anticipated another important leptonic property : neutrinos `` oscillate '' from one species to another with a high probability .",
    "their mixing angles are large .",
    "we ve known that different species of quarks mix , but their mixing angles are very small ; the largest one is 13 degrees , and others are much smaller . in comparison ,",
    "the known mixing of muon and tau neutrinos is consistent with being _",
    "maximal _ , or 45 degrees .",
    "another surprise is the neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "the quarks and charged leptons have what are referred to as hierarchical mass spectra , namely that the masses of charged fermions that share the same quantum numbers are drastically different among three generations of elementary particles .",
    "for instance , the masses of the up- and top - quarks are different by almost five orders of magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the two heavier neutrino masses differ _ at most _ by a factor of about five , and may possibly even be degenerate .",
    "our knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing angles is still imprecise and incomplete .",
    "future measurements are likely to bring more surprises .",
    "there is very little matter in our universe .",
    "that was not the case at an earlier stage .",
    "there were approximately equal amount of matter and anti - matter particles as there were photons and neutrinos .",
    "as the universe cooled , most of the matter and anti - matter annihilated into pure energy , and disappeared .",
    "the fact that there is still matter left means that there must have been a small imbalance between matter and anti - matter , at the level of one part in ten billion .",
    "if not for this excess , all matter would have annihilated with all the anti - matter and we would not exist .",
    "why do we exist ?",
    "the scientific question is rather what caused this tiny imbalance .",
    "it turns out that the finite mass of the neutrino may well have played a fundamental role .",
    "all neutrinos detected are left - handed , namely that their spins point the opposite directions from their momenta .",
    "likewise , all anti - neutrinos are right - handed .",
    "now that neutrinos were found to have finite masses , as discussed in the previous section , we have to incorporate the massive neutrinos by extending the standard model .",
    "note that massive neutrinos do not travel at speed of light . in principle ,",
    "an observer can go faster than the neutrino and look back at it . then a neutrino would appear right - handed to the observer .",
    "this is a state we have not seen before .",
    "is this a new particle ?",
    "if so , we have to introduce right - handed neutrinos , which do not have any of the standard model gauge interactions , into the theory .",
    "this is the possibility of the dirac neutrino . on the other hand , we already know neutral right - handed fermions : anti - neutrinos . could this state",
    "be an anti - neutrino ?",
    "if so , we have to abandon the fundamental distinction between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , and hence matter and anti - matter .",
    "this is the possibility of the majorana neutrino",
    ".    if the neutrino is a majorana fermion , the the neutrino and the anti - neutrino are the same object .",
    "this being the case , it becomes possible for matter to transform into anti - matter and vice - versa .",
    "therefore , the existence of neutrino masses makes it possible to create an imbalance between matter and anti - matter in early universe .",
    "this possibility is known as `` leptogenesis . '' in other words , neutrino masses may play a role in providing the environment necessary for our very existence . ) . ]",
    "the fact that the neutrino has no electric charge endows it with certain properties not shared by the charged fermions of the standard model : i.e.  it can be its own antiparticle without violating electric charge conservation . in that case , the neutrino is called a majorana fermion ; otherwise it is called a dirac neutrino .",
    "this leads to a whole new class of experimental signatures , the most prominent among them being the process of neutrinoless double beta decay of heavy nuclei , ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "since @xmath19 arises due to the presence of neutrino majorana masses , the observation of @xmath19 decay , in addition to establishing the existence of lepton number violation , can also provide very precise information about neutrino masses and mixing , provided ( i ) one can satisfactorily eliminate other contributions to this process that may arises from other interactions in full beyond - the - standard - model theory , as we discuss below , ( ii ) one can precisely estimate the values of the nuclear matrix elements associated with the @xmath19 in question .",
    "we will use the notation where the weak - eigenstates ( defined as the neutrino that is produced in a charged - current weak interaction process associated with a well - defined charged lepton ) are denoted by @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 ) , where the ellipsis indicate yet to be discovered  sterile \" states that are not produced in association with charged leptons and/or fourth - generation neutrinos .",
    "let us now focus on the case of only three majorana neutrinos , with mass matrix @xmath22 in the weak - eigenbasis ( note that @xmath23 is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath24 ) . in the weak - basis where the charged lepton mass - matrix and the charged current coupling - matrix is diagonal , the neutrino mass - matrix is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo ( mnsp ) matrix , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , are the neutrino mass - eigenvalues , which can be taken real and positive .",
    "we choose to write @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given by eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "the phases in @xmath31 are the so - called majorana phases .",
    "the case for dirac neutrinos is similar , except that @xmath31 can be absorbed into the phases of neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "the mass - eigenstate @xmath32 , @xmath33 , has a well - defined mass @xmath27 and we will order the mass eigenvalues such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "flavor eigenstates are expressed in terms of the mass eigenstates as follows : @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 are the elements of the mnsp matrix , and are related to the observable mixing angles in the basis where the charged lepton masses are diagonal .    for the case of three majorana neutrinos , the mnsp matrix @xmath26 can be written as : @xmath39 , where @xmath30 will be parameterized as @xmath40         neutrino oscillation experiments have already provided measurements for the neutrino mass - squared differences , as well as the mixing angles .",
    "the allowed values for the @xmath41 as well as the @xmath42 s are , at the 3@xmath43 level : @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ; @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ; @xmath48 .",
    "there is currently no constraint on any of the cp - odd phases or on the sign of @xmath49 .",
    "since the oscillation data are only sensitive to mass - squared differences , they allow for three possible arrangements of the different mass levels :    1 .",
    "normal hierarchy , i.e.  @xmath50 . in this case",
    ", we can deduce the value of @xmath51 ev . in this case @xmath52 .",
    "the solar neutrino oscillation involves the two lighter levels .",
    "the mass of the lightest neutrino is unconstrained . if @xmath53 , then we get the value of @xmath54  ev .",
    "inverted hierarchy , i.e.  @xmath55 with @xmath56 ev . in this case ,",
    "solar neutrino oscillation takes place between the heavier levels and we have @xmath57 .",
    "we have no information about @xmath58 except that its value is much less than the other two masses .",
    "3 .   degenerate neutrinos , i.e.  @xmath59 .",
    "oscillation experiments do not tell us about the overall scale of masses .",
    "it is therefore important to explore to what extent the absolute values of the masses can be determined . while discussing the question of absolute masses , it is good to keep in mind that none of the methods discussed below can provide any information about the lightest neutrino mass in the cases of a normal or inverted mass - hierarchy .",
    "they are most useful for determining absolute masses in the case of degenerate neutrinos , i.e. , when all @xmath60  ev .    one can directly search for the kinematical effect of nonzero neutrino masses in beta - decay by looking for structure near the end point of the electron energy spectrum .",
    "this search is sensitive to neutrino masses regardless of whether the neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles .",
    "one is sensitive to the quantity @xmath61 .",
    "the troitsk and mainz experiments place the present upper limit on @xmath62  ev .",
    "the proposed katrin experiment is projected to be sensitive to @xmath63  ev , which will have important implications for the theory of neutrino masses .",
    "for instance , if the result is positive , it will imply a degenerate spectrum ; on the other hand a negative result will be a very useful constraint .",
    "if neutrinos are majorana particles , the rate for @xmath19 decay majorana mass for the neutrino @xcite depends on the combination @xmath64 , provided heavy particle contributions to this process present in various theories are small @xcite .",
    "if they are not small however ( which will need additional experiments to decide ) , observing @xmath19 decay will still be of fundamental significance since it will provide the first observation of lepton number violation , for which there is strong theoretical motivation .",
    "the present best upper bound on @xmath19 decay lifetimes come from the heidelberg - moscow and the igex experiments and can be translated into an upper limit on @xmath65  ev .",
    "there is a claim of discovery of neutrinoless double beta decay of enriched @xmath66 experiment by the heidelberg - moscow collaboration @xcite .",
    "interpreted in terms of a majorana mass of the neutrino , this implies @xmath67 between 0.11 ev to 0.56 ev .",
    "if confirmed , this result is of fundamental significance . for more discussions of this result ,",
    "we refer the reader to the report of the double beta decay working group .",
    "a very different way to get information on the absolute scale of neutrino masses is to study the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , as well as to study the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "this is discussed in the cosmology working group report .",
    "observations of cmb anisotropy and surveys of large scale structure have set a limit on the sum of neutrino masses @xmath68  ev @xcite .",
    "more recent results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) place the limit of @xmath69 ev .",
    "a point worth emphasizing is that the above result is valid for both majorana and dirac neutrinos as long as the `` right - handed '' neutrinos decouple before the bbn epoch and are not regenerated subsequently .",
    "these limits already provide nontrivial information about neutrino masses : the limit @xmath70  ev , if taken at face value , implies that each individual neutrino mass is smaller than @xmath71  ev , which is similar to the projected sensitivity of the proposed katrin experiment .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that there are three urgent pieces of information needed to answer the question of whether the neutrinos are majorana or dirac fermions .",
    "three experiments that play a crucial role in this are ( i ) neutrinoless double beta decay search ; ( ii ) determination of the sign of @xmath49 and ( iii ) direct search for neutrino mass in tritium decay ( e.g.  katrin ) or similar decay experiments . in table",
    "[ tab : natureofneutrinos ] , we present conclusions about the nature of neutrinos for different outcomes of these three types of experiments ( for katrin a goal of 0.2 ev and for @xmath19 decay a goal of about 2 mev is taken and @xmath72 ) .",
    ".different possible conclusions regarding the nature of the neutrinos and their mass hierarchy from the three complementary experiments . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while the @xmath73 group is enough to unify @xmath74 in to a simple group , it does not unify the matter content .",
    "they are split into @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos can be introduced to the model but are not required . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath77 group unifies the matter content into a single @xmath78 , which in turn requires right - handed neutrinos .",
    "their mass is naturally of the order of the grand - unification scale , once @xmath79 is broken by a higgs in either @xmath80 or @xmath81 representation , and their exchange produces the neutrino mass operator eq .",
    "( [ eq : d5 ] ) .",
    "the higgs in @xmath81 , however , also contains a weak - triplet whose exchange can give rise to the type - ii seesaw as well .",
    "we give a very small sample of the different predictions for @xmath82 in models with either * 16 * or * 126 * in table iv and a very incomplete list of references in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here , we briefly summarize generic consequences of so(10 ) models .",
    "( i ) the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal although with type ii seesaw , the spectrum can be degenerate . in fact any evidence for a degenerate neutrino spectrum would be an indication for type ii seesaw in general .",
    "( ii ) they make definite predictions about the mixing angle @xmath82 as given in table iv and often for the other mixing angles .",
    "( iii ) neutrinos are majorana .",
    "the first two predictions can be tested by long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments , while the third by neutrinoless double beta decay experiments .      in the study of these top - down models",
    ", the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution may affect the neutrino masses and mixings significantly .",
    "formalisms have been developed to study it model - independently .",
    "the rg equation of the effective neutrino mass operator in the sm and mssm @xcite can be translated into differential equations for the energy dependence of the mass eigenvalues , mixing angles and cp phases @xcite . in the sm and in the mssm with small @xmath83 ,",
    "the rg evolution of the mixing angles is negligible due to the smallness of the @xmath84 yukawa coupling .",
    "it is the stronger the more degenerate the mass spectrum is . for a strong normal mass hierarchy , it is negligible even in the mssm with a large @xmath83 , but for an inverted hierarchy a significant running is possible even if the lightest neutrino is massless . furthermore , non - zero phases tend to damp the running .",
    "typically , @xmath85 undergoes the strongest rg evolution because the solar mass squared difference is much smaller than the atmospheric one .",
    "the rg equations for the cp phases show that whenever the mixings run sizably , the same happens for the phases .",
    "apart from modifying the predictions of top - down models , rg effects also open up new possibilities for model building , such as the radiative magnification of mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "if one restricts oneself to the running below the lowest seesaw scale , @xmath86 , significant magnification can occur only if @xmath60  ev ( a value observable in @xmath19 decay ) . with the running above @xmath86",
    ", magnification can be achieved for less degenerate light neutrino spectra , too ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "rg effects can also cause important changes of the input parameters for calculations of high - energy processes relevant for leptogenesis .",
    "furthermore , they induce deviations of @xmath82 from zero and @xmath87 from the maximal angle that provide an additional motivation for planned oscillation experiments . given the expected accuracy of these measurements , even relatively small rg effects are interesting in this context .",
    "understanding the origin of matter is one of the fundamental questions of cosmology the answer to which is most likely going to come from particle physics .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is at the heart of one particle physics mechanism and we discuss what we can learn about neutrino physics as well as the pattern of right handed neutrino masses from the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "three ingredients are required to generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe : baryon number violation , cp violation and some out - of - thermal equilibrium dynamics . the seesaw model @xcite , which was introduced to give small neutrino masses",
    ", naturally satisfies these requirements , producing the baryon asymmetry by `` leptogenesis '' @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the relation between the requirements of successful leptogenesis , and the observable neutrino masses and mixing matrix . in particular , does the cp violation that could be observed in neutrino oscillations bear any relation to leptogenesis ?    the idea of leptogenesis is to use the lepton number violation of the @xmath88 majorana masses @xmath89 , in conjunction with the @xmath90 violation contained in the standard model , to generate the baryon asymmetry .",
    "the most cosmology - independent implementation is `` thermal leptogenesis '' @xcite .",

    "arose recently with the observation that the lsnd , solar , and atmospheric neutrino data can be accommodated simultaneously without invoking a sterile neutrino provided the neutrino and anti - neutrino masses are not the same violating cpt @xcite .",
    "the kamland data , however , require @xmath249 oscillations with parameters consistent with the solar neutrino oscillation , and cpt - violation alone can not explain lsnd .",
    "a different proposal to explain lsnd and atmospheric anti - neutrino oscillations with a single @xmath42 @xcite , is excluded by the atmospheric neutrino data @xcite .",
    "the introduction of cpt violation improves significantly four neutrino ( three active and one sterile ) fits to all neutrino data ( including lsnd ) @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the short - baseline experiments constraining the interpretation of the lsnd data with a sterile neutrino involve mostly neutrinos but not anti - neutrinos , and the @xmath250 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : newcptviolation ] ) is allowed if there is little mixing of the sterile state with the active ones .",
    "spectrum , while the anti - neutrinos may have either @xmath250 or @xmath251 spectrum.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   spectrum , while the anti - neutrinos may have either @xmath250 or @xmath251 spectrum.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    other possibilities that go beyond conventional quantum field theory have been proposed as a way to understand the lsnd anomaly .",
    "decoherence is one such possibility @xcite , which can be tested using neutrino oscillation studies .",
    "in this report , we presented a brief review of the present knowledge of neutrino physics and what we can learn from planned experiments in the next decade .",
    "the discussion group feels that three three most important experiments ( beyond the katrin experiment which is already under way ) that will have a significant impact on clarifying the nature of neutrino mass hierarchy , the nature of the neutrino ( dirac or majorana ) as well as the search for physics beyond the standard model are : ( i ) search for @xmath19 decay , ( ii ) determination of the sign of the @xmath252 and ( iii ) measurement of the value of @xmath82 .",
    "the last one will not only specify the neutrino mass matrix more precisely than we know today but will considerably narrow the field of models .",
    "next in our top priority list is the measurement of the dirac phase , which will give a partial understanding of cp violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "we believe that all support should be given to miniboone experiment till it provides a complete resolution of the lsnd result .",
    "if the miniboone confirms the lsnd result , we need to completely revise our current understanding of neutrinos and , perhaps , particle physics .",
    "therefore search for properties of the sterile neutrinos will become a very high priority item at the same level as those discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "within the three neutrino picture , the precise measurement of the solar and atmospheric mixing angles will significantly help discriminate among various new physics possibilities .",
    "we consider it as the next level of priority .",
    "if miniboone does not confirm lsnd , the light sterile neutrinos could still be playing a subdominant role in solar neutrino physics , as has been suggested by several theoretical models . at the next level of priority",
    ", we consider items such as : ( i)search for subdominant effects of light sterile neutrinos using precision measurements of pp neutrinos from the sun ; ( ii ) search for neutrino magnetic moment , whose values below the current astrophysical limit of @xmath253 will be a sure indication of tev scale new physics , such as a tev scale left - right model , horizontal models , or large extra dimensions ; ( iii ) searches for exotic physics involving neutrinos that can test the limits of the assumptions on which the standard model is based e.g. , the violation of lorentz invariance , the existence of new long range forces coupled to lepton number , cpt violation , etc .",
