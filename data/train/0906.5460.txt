    "buoyancy driven motions of an electrically conducting fluid in a rotating system and in the presence of a magnetic field represent a fundamental aspect of the dynamics in stars and in planetary interiors .",
    "it is thus not surprising that this topic has received much attention ever since chandrasekhar ( 1961 ) and others have presented the first mathematical solutions for problems of this kind . because of the numerous parameters entering these problems it is not always easy to gain an overview of the physically relevant convection modes .",
    "analytical expressions are thus especially desirable , even though they can usually be obtained only for the onset of convection in planar layers . for some examples of this kind",
    "we refer to chandrasekhar s monograph ( 1961 ) . from the geo- and astrophysical point of view ,",
    "magnetoconvection in spherical configurations is of special interest . here",
    "numerical schemes are usually required for the solution of the mathematical problems . for an overview of the subject we refer to the article by fearn ( 1994 )",
    ".    in the case of low prandtl numbers convection typically assumes the form of inertial waves .",
    "buoyancy and viscous dissipation can be treated as perturbations and analytical expressions for the critical values of the rayleigh numbers for onset of convection can be obtained .",
    "this approach has been employed in the case of a rotating sphere without magnetic field first by zhang ( 1994 ) . for later analyses with different boundary conditions",
    "see zhang ( 1995 ) and busse & simitev ( 2004 ) .",
    "magneto - inertial modes can be excited in the presence of both , the coriolis force and the lorentz force of an imposed magnetic field .",
    "of particular interest from an astrophysical point of view are magneto - inertial waves in rotating fluid spheres with a strong azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "malkus ( 1967 ) has demonstrated that for a magnetic field corresponding to an axial electric current with constant density the dispersion relation for magneto - inertial modes can be expressed in terms of the dispersion relation of inertial modes in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "he thus obtained simple analytical expressions for magneto - inertial waves in a configuration of special interest for geophysical and astrophysical applications . in this paper",
    "we use the malkus approach as a starting point for an analysis of the onset of convection in a rotating sphere permeated by a azimuthal magnetic field . in analogy to the treatment of inertial convection in the paper of busse and simitev ( 2004 )",
    "we investigate the effect of buoyancy and ohmic dissipation as perturbations on magneto - inertial waves .",
    "the main result is the determination of expressions for the critical rayleigh number for the onset of convection as a function of the rotation rate , the strength of the magnetic field and the other parameters of the problem .    in the following we start with the mathematical formulation of the problem in section 2",
    "the special limit of a high ratio of thermal to magnetic diffusivity will be treated in section 3 .",
    "the general case requires the symbolic evaluation of lengthy analytical expressions and will be presented in section 4 .",
    "a discussion of the results and an outlook on related problems will be given in the final section 5 of the paper .",
    "we consider a homogeneously heated , self - gravitating fluid sphere as shown in figure [ f.01 ] .",
    "the sphere is rotating with a constant angular velocity @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the axial unit vector . the fluid is electrically conducting and is characterized by its magnetic diffusivity @xmath2 , its kinematic viscosity @xmath3 and its thermal diffusivity @xmath4 .",
    "following malkus ( 1967 ) we assume that the fluid sphere is permeated by a magnetic field of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position vector with respect to the center of the sphere and @xmath7 is its length measured in fractions of the radius @xmath8 of the sphere . since the lorentz force like the centrifugal force can be balanced by the pressure gradient a static state exists with the temperature distribution @xmath9 and the gravity field given by @xmath10 .",
    "we use the length @xmath8 , the time @xmath11 , the temperature @xmath12 and the magnetic flux density @xmath13 as scales for the dimensionless description of the problem .",
    "the density is assumed to be constant except in the gravity term where its temperature dependence given by @xmath14 const .",
    "is taken into account .",
    "since we are interested in the onset of convection in the form of small disturbances we can neglect all quadratic terms in the equations .",
    "the linearized versions of the equations of motion , the equation of magnetic induction , and the heat equation for the deviation @xmath15 from the static temperature distribution are thus given by    [ 100 ] @xmath16    where the dimensionless magnetic field has been assumed in the form @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the vector of the density of the imposed electric current . the rayleigh number @xmath19 , the coriolis parameter @xmath20 and the prandtl number @xmath21 and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath22 are defined by @xmath23 we have attached a @xmath24 to the rayleigh number to remind the reader that the magnetic diffusivity replaces the kinematic viscosity in the definition of @xmath25 .",
    "we have also introduced the strebor number @xmath26 which is the inverse of what often is called the roberts number . without losing generality",
    "we may assume an exponential dependence on time @xmath27 and on the azimuthal angle @xmath28 .",
    "since both , the velocity field @xmath29 and the magnetic field @xmath30 , are solenoidal we may use the the representation of these vector fields in terms of poloidal and toroidal components ,    [ 120 ] @xmath31    equation can now be written in the form @xmath32 which allows us to eliminate @xmath30 from equation , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 . in the @xmath36-operator",
    "the @xmath28-derivative is replaced by @xmath37 , of course . in equation",
    "the magnetic field @xmath30 appears only in the form of the boundary layer correction @xmath38 which is required since the basic dissipationless solution does not satisfy all boundary conditions .",
    "for the same reason the ekman layer correction @xmath39 had to be introduced .",
    "in the following we shall assume the limit of large @xmath20 such that in first order of approximation the right hand side of equation can be neglected .",
    "the left hand side together with the condition @xmath40 is of the same form as the equation for inertial modes . among the latter those corresponding to the sectorial spherical harmonics",
    "usually lead to the lowest critical rayleigh numbers for the onset of convection .",
    "we shall assume that this property continues to hold as long as @xmath41 is sufficiently small .",
    "the sectorial inertial modes are given by @xmath42 with    [ 160 ] @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the frequency of the inertial modes .",
    "the sectorial magneto - inertial modes are described by the same velocity field and their magnetic field is given by @xmath45 .",
    "as before the subscript @xmath46 refers to the dissipationless solution of equations ( [ 100]a , b , c ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath47 of the magneto - inertial waves is determined by @xmath48 which yields @xmath49 with account of ( 2.6b ) , this dispersion relation allows for a total of four different frequencies @xmath47 . for small values of @xmath41",
    "these are given by    [ 170 ] @xmath50    the upper sign in expression refers to retrogradely propagating modified inertial waves , while the lower sign corresponds to the progradely traveling variety .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field tends to increase the absolute value of the frequency in both cases .",
    "expression describes the dispersion of the slow magnetic waves .",
    "the upper sign refers to the progradely traveling modified alfven waves and the lower sign corresponds to retrogradely propagating modified alfven waves .",
    "the magneto - inertial waves described by expressions satisfy the condition that the normal component of the velocity field vanishes at the boundary .",
    "this property implies that the normal component of the magnetic field vanishes there as well .",
    "additional boundary conditions must be specified when the full dissipative problem described by is considered .",
    "we shall assume a stress - free boundary with either a fixed temperature ( case a ) or a thermally insulating boundary ( case b ) , @xmath51 additionally we shall assume an electrically insulating exterior of the sphere which requires @xmath52 and the matching of the poloidal magnetic field to a potential field outside the sphere .",
    "following the procedure of earlier papers ( zhang , 1994 ; busse and simitev , 2004 ) we use a perturbation approach for solving equations in the limit of large @xmath20 , @xmath53 after the ansatz has been inserted into equation such that terms with @xmath54 appear on the left hand side , while those with @xmath55 and @xmath56 appear on the right hand side , we obtain the solvability condition for the equation for @xmath54 by multiplying it with @xmath57 and averaging it over the fluid sphere , @xmath58 where the brackets @xmath59 indicate the average over the fluid sphere and the @xmath60 indicates the complex conjugate .",
    "we have neglected all terms connected with viscous dissipation , i.e. we have assumed the of vanishing @xmath22 , since we wish to focus on the effect of ohmic dissipation .",
    "the effects of viscous dissipation have been dealt with in the earlier paper ( busse and simitev , 2004 ) . since @xmath61 vanishes , as demonstrated in @xcite , we must consider only the influence of the boundary layer magnetic field @xmath62 .",
    "it is determined by the equation @xmath63 since the solutions of this equation are characterized by gradients of the order @xmath64 , the boundary layer correction needed for the poloidal component is of the order @xmath64 smaller than the correction needed for the toroidal component . for large @xmath20",
    "we need to take into account only the contribution @xmath65 given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the sign of @xmath47 .",
    "the solvability condition thus becomes reduced to @xmath68",
    "the equation for @xmath15 can most easily be solved in the limit of vanishing @xmath70 . in this limit",
    "we obtain for @xmath15 , @xmath71 with @xmath72 where the coefficient @xmath73 is given by @xmath74   \\displaystyle\\frac{(m+4)/m}{(m+5)(m+4)-(m+1)m } - \\displaystyle\\frac{(m+2)/m}{(m+3)(m+2)-(m+1)m }   & \\text{case b. } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] since @xmath15 and the left hand side of equation ( 2.19 ) is imaginary , the real parts of the two terms on the right hand side must balance .",
    "we thus obtain for @xmath75 the result @xmath76 where the coefficient @xmath77 assumes the values @xmath78   14m^2 + 59m+63   & \\text{case b. } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] obviously the lowest value of @xmath19 is usually reached for @xmath79 , but the fact that there are four different possible values of the frequency @xmath47 complicate the determination of the critical value @xmath80 .",
    "expression is also of interest , however , in the case of spherical fluid shells when the ( @xmath79)-mode is affected most strongly by the presence of the inner boundary .",
    "convection modes corresponding to higher values of @xmath81 may then become preferred at onset since their @xmath7-dependence decays more rapidly with distance from the outer boundary according to relationships .",
    "for the solution of equation in the general case it is convenient to use the green s function method . the green s function @xmath82 is obtained as solution of the equation @xmath83 g(r , a )   = \\delta(r - a),\\ ] ] which can be solved in terms of the spherical bessel functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86   g_2(r , a ) = a j_m(\\mu r)+ b y_m(\\mu r )   \\qquad & \\text{for $ a <   r \\leq 1 $ , } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 @xmath88 a solution of the equation can be obtained in the form @xmath89 evaluations of these integrals for @xmath79 yield the expressions @xmath90",
    "\\displaystyle\\frac{2r}{(\\omega_0 \\tau s)^2}\\left ( r(\\mu^2 + 10 ) - \\mu^2r^3 -    \\displaystyle\\frac{(\\mu^2 - 10)\\big(\\mu r \\cos(\\mu r ) - \\sin(\\mu r)\\big)}{r^2\\big(2\\mu \\cos\\mu -      ( 2-\\mu^2)\\sin\\mu\\big)}\\right )   & \\text{case b. }   \\end{cases}\\ ] ] lengthier expressions are obtained for @xmath91 .",
    "expressions can now be used to calculate @xmath25 and @xmath56 on the basis of equation . in the case",
    "@xmath79 we obtain @xmath92 \\displaystyle      \\left(\\mu^{-4}+231\\mu^{-8}+7\\;\\text{re}\\left\\{\\frac{(\\mu^5 - 8\\mu^3 + 9\\mu)\\cos\\mu-9\\sin\\mu}{\\mu^8\\big((\\mu^2 - 2)\\sin\\mu+2\\mu\\cos\\mu\\big ) } \\right\\}\\right)^{-1 } & \\text{case b , } \\\\",
    "\\end{cases } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where re@xmath93 indicates the real part of the term enclosed by @xmath93 .",
    "expressions have been plotted as functions of @xmath26 in figures [ f1](c ) and [ f2](c ) for the cases a and b , respectively . four curves appear since there are four possible values of @xmath47 for each @xmath81 . for values @xmath26 of the order @xmath94 or less ,",
    "expressions are well approached .",
    "the retrograde mode corresponding to the positive sign in always yields the lower value of @xmath25 but it looses its preference to the progradely traveling modified alfven mode corresponding to the upper sign in as @xmath26 becomes of the order @xmath95 or larger .",
    "this transition can be understood on the basis of the increasing difference in phase between @xmath15 and @xmath96 with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "while the mode with the largest absolute value of @xmath97 is preferred as long as @xmath15 and @xmath96 are in phase , the mode with the minimum absolute value of @xmath97 becomes preferred as the phase difference increases since the latter is detrimental to the work done by the buoyancy force .",
    "the frequency perturbation @xmath56 usually makes only a small contribution to @xmath97 which tends to decrease the absolute value of @xmath97 .",
    "this transition shifts towards smaller values of @xmath26 and @xmath34 as @xmath20 is increased as illustrated in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "the magneto - inertial convective modes corresponding to higher values of @xmath98 exhibit similar behaviour as figures [ f1](d ) and [ f2](d ) demonstrate for the cases a and b , respectively .",
    "the value @xmath79 is always the preferred value of the wavenumber , except possibly in a very narrow range near @xmath99 as indicated by figure [ f1](a , b ) in the case a and possibly near @xmath100 in the case b and figure [ f2](a , b ) .",
    "the axisymmetric mode @xmath101 , given for comparison in panels ( c ) and ( d ) in figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] , is never preferred in contrast to the purely non - magnetic case where it becomes the critical one near the transition from retrograde to prograde inertial convection modes as seen in figure [ f.02 ] .",
    "for very large values of @xmath20 and @xmath26 the rayleigh number @xmath25 increases in proportion to @xmath102 for fixed @xmath81 . in spite of",
    "this strong increase @xmath15 remains of the order @xmath103 on the right hand side of equation .",
    "the perturbation approach thus continues to be valid for @xmath104 as long as @xmath105 can be assumed . for any fixed low value of @xmath26 ,",
    "however , the onset of convection in the form of prograde inertial modes will be replaced with increasing @xmath20 at some point by the onset in the form of columnar magneto - convection because the latter obeys an approximate asymptotic relationship for @xmath75 of the form @xmath106 ( see , for example , eltayeb & kumar , 1977 ) .",
    "this second transition depends on the value of @xmath26 and will occur at higher values of @xmath20 and @xmath75 for lower values of @xmath26 .",
    "there is little chance that magneto - inertial convection occurs in the earth s core , for instance , since @xmath26 is of the order @xmath107 while the usual estimate for @xmath20 is @xmath108 but it might be relevant for understanding of rapidly rotating stars with strong magnetic fields .",
    "a major result of early studies of magnetoconvection in rapidly rotating systems is the existence of an absolute minimum critical rayleigh number ( chandrasekhar , 1961 , eltayeb & kumar , 1977 ) .",
    "imposed magnetic field typically has the effect of increasing the azimuthal scale in comparison with non - magnetic convection .",
    "when the magnetic field is weak the small scale of convection rolls leads to a larger value of the critical rayleigh number as the magnetic field strength decreases .",
    "when the magnetic field is strong , it inhibits convection and the critical rayleigh number increases with the increase of the strength of the imposed field .",
    "consequently , an optimal state of convection exists at intermediate magnetic field strength . in this paper",
    "we consider the weak field regime but a decrease of the critical rayleigh number with increasing field strength is not observed .",
    "this is due to the fact that , non - magnetic inertial convection already has a rather large azimuthal length scale ( busse & simitev , 2004 ) which can not be increased significantly further by the imposed weak magnetic field .",
