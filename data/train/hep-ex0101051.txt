    "at high energy , quark fragmentation can be calculated using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the results are often referred to as qcd showers @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations require , for comparison with experimental results , some model or experimental input to take into account the eventual hadronization of gluons and @xmath35 pairs into actual hadrons of known mass .",
    "several models have thus been developed , mostly based on a chromodynamic string connecting the initial @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite , where the subscript indicates that these are the primary quarks formed by @xmath38 annihilation . when stretched because of the initial momentum of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the string breaks by creation of secondary @xmath35 pairs , generating two substrings .",
    "the process iterates then for the new substrings until the physical hadrons are produced .",
    "this last stage is the critical one where qcd loses its predictive power .",
    "the model most frequently used to simulate the process @xmath39 is the qcd inspired lund string model ( lsm )  @xcite , implemented in the jetset monte carlo simulation package  @xcite . in order to solve the problem of generating hadrons of known mass , the jetset implementation of lsm , at each step of its iterative process , splits a @xmath35 string into a hadron of known quantum numbers and mass and a remainder string having the leftover quantum numbers and energy - momentum .",
    "when , finally , the remainder string has a mass below a suitable limit , this string is made into two known hadrons that , together , carry the leftover quantum numbers .    in this paper we report on correlations between charm baryons in the fragmentation of a @xmath40 system produced in the reaction @xmath41 at @xmath42  gev , where the annihilation occurs in a largely low-@xmath43 , non - perturbative regime .",
    "in contrast to inclusive single - particle production , compensation of baryon and charm number is a more subtle aspect of quark fragmentation modeling .",
    "one obvious question is whether baryon compensation occurs locally ( e.g. , small rapidity difference between baryon and antibaryon ) or globally ( large rapidity difference ) .",
    "previous studies of @xmath44 production at @xmath45=90 gev found that in events containing both a @xmath46 and a @xmath47 , the two particles tended to be produced at very similar rapidities  @xcite .",
    "consider the case in which a charm baryon is produced in the first step of fragmentation ( e.g. @xmath48 ) ; it is possible that both baryon and quantum charm numbers be compensated in the opposite hemisphere ( e.g. @xmath49 ) . in the limit",
    "that the @xmath50 and @xmath51 quarks fragment independently ( presumably true at some sufficiently high energy ) , this type of correlation is not expected .",
    "the jetset implementation of the lund model , because of the mechanism outlined above , does not produce such a correlation . in the very reasonable approximation of neglecting string splitting",
    "by @xmath40 tunneling from the vacuum , at @xmath42  gev all observed charmed particles must contain a primary quark .",
    "we take advantage of this to discriminate between independent vs. correlated fragmentation models .",
    "if we assume that primary quarks fragment independently , then the number of times that we find a @xmath52 baryon opposite a @xmath3 antibaryon in an event ( i.e. , @xmath530 , denoted `` @xmath54 '' ) , scaled to the total number of observed @xmath3 ( denoted `` @xmath55 '' ) , should be equal to the number of times that we find a @xmath56 baryon opposite any other anti - charmed hadron @xmath57 , scaled to the total number of observed anti - charmed hadrons ( @xmath58 ) . in this analysis , we will check the equality of these ratios ; by comparing ratios in this way , we cancel many experimental systematics .",
    "schematically , we are comparing the following event topologies : +     @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61    specifically , we compare the rate of @xmath62 production to the rate of @xmath63 and @xmath64 production .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath65 s and @xmath66 s through the well - measured decay modes @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "@xmath2 s are fully reconstructed in the decay modes @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and partially reconstructed through @xmath74x . s opposite an anti - charm tag are charmed baryon daughters ( predominantly @xmath75 ) after imposing a 1 gev / c minimum momentum requirement on the @xmath46 ( @xmath761 gev / c ) . ]",
    "@xmath77 s are also studied ; these are reconstructed in @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    under the assumption of independent fragmentation",
    ", we expect the relative production ratios to satisfy :    @xmath80 = 1 +    and ,    @xmath81 = 1 .",
    "this analysis was performed using the cleo ii and the upgraded cleo ii.v detectors operating at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) at center - of - mass energies @xmath45 = 10.5210.58 gev . for 4.5 fb@xmath82 of the data used for this analysis ( `` cleo - ii '' data@xcite ) ,",
    "measurements of charged particle momenta were made with three nested coaxial drift chambers consisting of 6 , 10 , and 51 layers , respectively . in a subsequent upgrade ( `` cleo - ii.v''@xcite ) ,",
    "the inner tracking chamber was replaced with a high - precision silicon detector ( corresponding to the remaining 9.1 fb@xmath82 of the data used for this analysis ) .",
    "the entire tracking system fills the volume from @xmath83=3 cm to @xmath83=1 m , with @xmath83 the radial coordinate relative to the beam ( @xmath84 ) axis .",
    "this system is very efficient ( @xmath8598% ) for detecting tracks that have transverse momenta ( @xmath86 ) relative to the beam axis greater than 200 mev / c , and that are contained within the good fiducial volume of the drift chamber ( @xmath870.94 , with @xmath88 defined as the polar angle relative to the beam axis ) .",
    "this system achieves a momentum resolution of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 is the momentum , measured in gev / c ) .",
    "pulse - height measurements in the main drift chamber provide specific ionization resolution of 5.0% ( cleo ii.v ) or 5.5% ( cleo",
    "ii ) for bhabha events , giving good @xmath91 separation for tracks with momenta up to 700 mev / c and separation of order 2@xmath92 in the relativistic rise region above 2.5 gev / c . outside",
    "the central tracking chambers are plastic scintillation counters , which are used as a fast element in the trigger system and also provide particle identification information from time - of - flight measurements .    beyond the time - of - flight system",
    "is the electromagnetic calorimeter , consisting of 7800 thallium - doped csi crystals .",
    "the central `` barrel '' region of the calorimeter covers about 75% of the solid angle and has an energy resolution which is empirically found to follow : @xmath93 @xmath94 is the shower energy in gev .",
    "this parameterization includes noise effects , and translates to an energy resolution of about 4% at 100 mev and 1.2% at 5 gev .",
    "two end - cap regions of the crystal calorimeter extend solid angle coverage to about 95% of @xmath95 , although energy resolution is not as good as that of the barrel region . the tracking system , time - of - flight counters , and calorimeter are all contained within a superconducting coil operated at 1.5 tesla .",
    "an iron flux return interspersed with proportional tubes used for muon detection is located immediately outside the coil and in the two end - cap regions .    the event sample used for this measurement",
    "is comprised of 9.1 @xmath0 of data collected at the @xmath96(4s ) resonance and 4.5 @xmath0 of data collected about 60 mev below the @xmath96(4s ) resonance .",
    "approximately @xmath97 continuum cc events are included in this sample .",
    "charged track candidates for protons , kaons or pions must pass the following restrictions :    \\(a ) the track must have an impact parameter relative to the estimated event vertex less than 5 mm in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis ( @xmath98 ) and no more than 5 cm along the beam axis .",
    "the estimated event vertex is obtained by averaging the @xmath38 interaction point over a full run .",
    "\\(b ) the track has specific ionization information consistent ( at the 99% confidence level ) with its assumed particle identity .",
    "\\(c ) the track must have momentum greater than 100 mev / c .",
    "all reconstructed charmed hadrons must have momentum greater than 2.3 gev / c to ensure that there is no contamination from @xmath99-meson decays to charm .",
    "we define the single tag yield to be the number of reconstructed events containing one anti - charmed hadron @xmath57 .",
    "this yield ( table [ tab : single - tags ] ) is determined by fitting a double - gaussian signal over a smooth , low - order polynomial background functional .",
    "the signal function is the sum of two gaussian functions , one narrow and one broad , and is a better representation of the expected signal line shape than a single gaussian function .",
    ".[tab : single - tags ] single tag yields obtained from one - dimensional fits ( charge conjugate modes are implied ) ; statistical errors only are shown . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the systematic errors are added , mode - by - mode , to determine the overall systematic error for each calculated production ratio ( table [ tab : ratios ] ) .",
    "the measured values of the production ratios imply that a @xmath75 is roughly three times more likely to be produced opposite a @xmath100 than opposite either a @xmath65 or a @xmath66 .",
    "these results indicate strong evidence in support of correlated production of the @xmath75 . assuming that 6% of charm quark fragmentation at @xmath10110 gev results in a charmed baryon , our result implies that approximately 20% of all @xmath75 s are produced in association with a @xmath3 in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "the effect is not produced by the jetset simulation but does not contradict the lund string model .",
    "in fact if the primary @xmath40 were broken at very small proper time by diquark - antidiquark tunneling from the vacuum , producing a ( possibly excited ) charm baryon system and anti - charm antibaryon system , a correlation of the type observed here would be generated .",
