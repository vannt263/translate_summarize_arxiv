    "an interesting class of isotropic inhomogeneous optical media that are currently investigated in optics is represented by the so - called spherical media , i.e. the media with spherically symmetric distribution of refractive index .",
    "these media found application in theoretical proposals of many optical devices that provide remarkable optical properties within the framework of geometrical optics .",
    "for example , we mention the spherical gradient - index lenses embedded into an optically homogeneous region that provide perfect imaging of two concentric spherical surfaces .",
    "their well known representatives are a luneburg and an eaton lens @xcite . in addition",
    ", we mention the absolute instruments that provide perfect imaging of three - dimensional domains @xcite .",
    "their famous representative is a maxwell s fish - eye @xcite which , in fact , provides perfect imaging also in terms of wave optics @xcite .",
    "a common approach to designing the spherical medium of specific properties is based on solving an inverse scattering problem .",
    "this is considerably simplified due to the symmetry of the spherical media which enables to treat these media as two - dimensional , because each light ray lies in a plane through the center of symmetry .",
    "the classical methods for solving the inverse scattering problem have been derived for both the spherical gradient - index lenses @xcite as well as the absolute instruments @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative method based on ideas of transformation optics has also been described @xcite .",
    "this alternative method utilizes an equivalence of the central section of the spherical medium and a curved rotationally symmetric surface with constant refractive index referred to as a geodesic lens @xcite . a great advantage of this method lies in a fact that the shape of a geodesic lens can be deduced relatively easily from the desired light ray trajectories for both the focusing spherical gradient - index lenses and the spherical absolute instruments .",
    "then , once the shape of a geodesic lens is known , the refractive index of an equivalent spherical medium can be calculated by a straightforward procedure .",
    "in this paper we use this alternative approach based on the concept of geodesic lenses to design new optical devices referred to as multi - focal gradient - index lenses and multi - focal absolute instruments .",
    "these devices formed by isotropic spherical media with complex spatial structure provide different imaging properties for different light rays and , therefore , enable to achieve remarkable optical effects .",
    "in fact , we have already presented some multi - focal absolute instruments before @xcite .",
    "however , now we show that the multi - focal absolute instruments as well as the multi - focal gradient - index lenses can easily be designed using the concept of geodesic lenses and that there is a close connection between them . as in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we perform the description within the framework of geometrical optics and we utilize the symmetry of spherical media to reduce the description to two dimensions .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s_gl_lenses ] is devoted to the derivation of the multi - focal gradient - index lenses embedded into an optically homogeneous region that provide perfect imaging of multiple pairs of concentric spherical surfaces .",
    "section [ s_ai ] is aimed to the derivation of the multi - focal absolute instruments that provide different imaging properties for different spatial domains .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] concludes the article .",
    "this section is devoted to the spherical gradient - index lenses embedded into an optically homogeneous region .",
    "we start with a brief summary of physics related to these optical devices and a procedure for solving the corresponding inverse scattering problem .",
    "then we utilize the general results to design the multi - focal gradient - index lenses that provide perfect imaging of multiple pairs of concentric spherical surfaces .",
    "let us start with a brief summary of physics related to the spherical gradient - index lenses and equivalent geodesic lenses .",
    "consider a plane with the system of polar coordinates @xmath0 that represents an optically homogeneous region with refractive index set to unity . into this plane",
    "we place a gradient - index lens of unit radius with the center at the origin ( see figure [ f_gil ] ) that is specified by a spherically symmetric refractive index @xmath1 , which meets the boundary condition @xmath2 .",
    "this gradient - index lens is , in terms of the transformation optics , equivalent to a geodesic lens which is a curved two - dimensional surface ( waveguide ) with rotational symmetry and refractive index set to unity ( see figure [ f_gil_geodesic ] ) .",
    "we describe its shape by a radial coordinate @xmath3 , an angular coordinate @xmath4 and a value of function @xmath5 , which represents the length of the surface measured along the meridian from the axis of symmetry to the given point .",
    "the coordinate transformation between the gradient - index lens and the geodesic lens follows from the comparison of equivalent optical path elements @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath6 , we get @xmath7 clearly , the shape of a geodesic lens depends primarily on the form of function @xmath8 . within the section [ s_gl_lenses ]",
    "we will assume that for @xmath9 $ ] the function @xmath10 is increasing with a single maximum at @xmath11 and , therefore , the shape of a geodesic lens is of the form sketched in figure [ f_gil_geodesic ] .",
    "although the function @xmath5 is unambiguous , it will be referred to as @xmath12 to maintain consistency with section [ s_ai ] .",
    "each light ray propagating in the spherical medium or on the geodesic lens is specified by a constant quantity @xmath13 that is analogous to an angular momentum known from classical mechanics ( therefore , we will call the quantity @xmath13 simply angular momentum ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an angle between the tangent to the ray trajectory and the radius vector in the spherical medium or , equivalently , an angle between the tangent to the ray trajectory and the meridian on a geodesic lens .",
    "the point of the ray trajectory where @xmath16 will be referred to as a turning point , its radial coordinate in the spherical medium as @xmath17 . considering an element of the ray trajectory and denoting @xmath18",
    ", we obtain with help of ( [ map ] ) and ( [ angularmomentum ] ) a differential equation @xmath19 that governs propagation of the light ray with angular momentum @xmath13 in the spherical medium and on the geodesic lens , respectively .",
    "these formulas represent the necessary basis for mathematical formulation of an inverse scattering problem discussed in the following section .",
    "the classical formulation of an inverse scattering problem for a gradient - index lens embedded into an optically homogeneous region lies in derivation of the refractive index @xmath1 from a given dependence of a scattering angle @xmath20 on the angular momentum @xmath13 , where the scattering angle corresponds to the angle by which the incoming light ray is deflected from its original direction ( see figure [ f_gil ] ) . here",
    ", we specify bending of the light rays in an equivalent , but slightly different way that is more suitable for addressing the inverse scattering problem related to designing the optical devices that provide stigmatic imaging of given surfaces . for a given light ray with angular momentum @xmath13",
    ", we choose a source point p@xmath21 $ ] on the straight line along which the light ray comes from infinity and we choose an image point p@xmath22 $ ] on the straight line along which the light ray continues to infinity after passing through the lens .",
    "in addition , we introduce an angle @xmath23 which corresponds to an absolute value of the polar angle swept by the light ray during its propagation between the points p@xmath24 and p@xmath25 ( see figure [ f_gil ] ) .",
    "the notation suggests that the radial coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 as well as the angle @xmath23 are , in general , functions of @xmath13 ; this is necessary for considering the multi - focal lenses discussed later .",
    "these three functions fully determine bending of the light rays passing through the lens and , therefore , the inverse problem lies in derivation of the refractive index @xmath1 from the given functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath23 .",
    "the mathematical formulation of this problem is based on expressing the polar angle @xmath23 and it results in an integral equation for the refractive index @xmath1 of the gradient - index lens or a similar integral equation for the function @xmath28 that parameterizes a geodesic lens .",
    "the particular form of these equations depends on the form of function @xmath29 . under the assumptions for the function @xmath8 given above",
    ", these integral equations can be written in a compact form @xmath30 where the function @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 the standard procedure for solving the integral equation for refractive index @xmath1 can be found in @xcite . here , we use an alternative approach that lies in solving the integral equation for the function @xmath28 and subsequent calculation of the refractive index @xmath1 .",
    "the integral equation for the function @xmath28 is a kind of abel integral equation and can be solved by a slight modification of the method presented in @xcite .",
    "the general result that is independent of the particular form of function @xmath31 is @xmath33 once we known the function @xmath28 , we are able to calculate the refractive index @xmath1 . using the relations ( [ map ] ) we get @xmath34 integrating this equation from the boundary of the lens to the turning point , given in the spherical medium by the radial coordinate @xmath35 equal to @xmath17 and on the geodesic lens by @xmath3 equal to the angular momentum @xmath13 , we obtain @xmath36 since we have assumed that the function @xmath8 is monotonic , also the function @xmath37 is monotonic and invertible .",
    "therefore , in principle we can find the inverse function @xmath38 and use it for calculation of the refractive index by means of relation @xmath39 which holds for the turning point because there @xmath40 . omitting the lower index of the radial coordinate ,",
    "we obtain the final result for the refractive index @xmath1 of the spherical medium forming the gradient - index lens .      in the following",
    "we will describe the gradient - index lenses that provide stigmatic imaging of pairs of concentric spherical surfaces .    in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have discussed the simplest case when there is only one pair of these surfaces .",
    "this corresponds to the situation when all the light rays with @xmath41 $ ] that emerge from a point source located at a given surface and that pass through the lens are focused into an image point located at the second given surface .",
    "such lenses can be found by solving the luneburg inverse problem @xcite and their well - known representatives are the maxwell s fish - eye lens , the luneburg lens and the eaton lens .    here",
    ", we deal with the multi - focal gradient - index lenses that provide perfect imaging of multiple pairs of concentric spherical surfaces . for simplicity , we start with the case when there are two pairs of these surfaces , i.e. the light rays passing through the lens are divided into two bundles specified by subintervals of angular momentum @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ] which , in general , have the source and the image points located at the spherical surfaces of different radii",
    ". then the radial coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the source and the image points , respectively , can be written as @xmath46\\\\      r_{\\mathrm{i}2 } & \\quad \\mathrm{for } \\quad l \\in ( l_1 , 1],\\\\    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given constants greater than or equal to unity .",
    "similarly , we write the angle @xmath51 swept by the light rays during the propagation from the source to the image in the form @xmath52 \\\\      m_2 \\pi & \\quad \\mathrm{for }",

    "we get the results for the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 in a compact form @xmath60 where @xmath61 clearly , the results for the function @xmath59 and the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are formally identical to the results presented in @xcite as a solution of the luneburg inverse problem .    the refractive index @xmath1 of the gradient - index lens can be calculated by a general procedure described in section [ s_lp_inverse_scattering ] .",
    "however , an analytical result can be obtained only for the special cases when the radial coordinates of the source and the image points are delimited to only two possibilities  unity and infinity , and also assuming that @xmath64 and @xmath65 . then the parameter @xmath66 , the parameter @xmath62 becomes independent of @xmath3 and we obtain an implicit formula @xmath67 for the function @xmath68 and a similar formula @xmath69 which specifies the function @xmath70 .",
    "however , in most cases the last equation can be solved only numerically .",
    "the described solution of the inverse scattering problem for the gradient - index lens that provide perfect imaging of two pairs of concentric spherical surfaces can easily be generalized for the cases with multiple pairs of these surfaces .",
    "then the light rays passing through the lens are divided into @xmath71 bundles specified by @xmath71 subintervals of angular momentum that are separated by @xmath72 real constants @xmath73 . in the @xmath74-th subinterval of angular momentum ,",
    "the functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath75 are given by the quantities @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , which represent generalization of the above notation .",

    "once the shape of a geodesic lens is known , the refractive index @xmath1 can be calculated by the procedure described in section [ s_lp_inverse_scattering ] .",
    "the general formula ( [ s1j ] ) for the function @xmath82 together with the formulas for the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 obtained by generalization of ( [ ab12 ] ) represent the main result of this section .",

    "let us now present in figure [ f_multifocal ] the ray tracing and the equivalent geodesic lenses for several examples of the multi - focal gradient - index lenses that provide perfect imaging of two concentric spherical surfaces .",
    "we focus on the special cases when the source and the image points are located at infinity or on the unit circle and we refer to the lenses according to the effective behavior of the light rays .    as the first example we present a lens determined by parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 which consists of a classical maxwell s fish - eye in the outer region , but acts as a generalized maxwell s fish - eye for the light rays passing through the inner region .",

    "clearly , the inverse function @xmath108 is multivalued ; we denote the corresponding branches by @xmath109 .",
    "the spherical medium defined above is equivalent to a geodesic lens of the shape sketched in figure [ f_ai_geodesic ] .",
    "regarding the assumed form of function @xmath8 , the geodesic lens must be parameterized by two branches of the function @xmath5 as follows .",
