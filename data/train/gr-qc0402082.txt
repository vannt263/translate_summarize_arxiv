    "recently , spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant @xmath1 have attracted a lot of attention in various contexts , such as the ads / conformal field theory ( cft ) correspondence ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) or the randall - sundrum brane world scenario  @xcite .",
    "one of the necessary investigations in these contexts would be to analyze the classical feature of the spacetime with negative @xmath1 , such as the black hole physics in these spacetimes .",
    "black hole physics in spacetimes with @xmath2 has a remarkable feature : the spatial topology of the black hole horizon is not necessarily spherical even in stationary four - dimensional spacetimes . in the 1990s ,",
    "new solutions which represent the black holes with nonspherical topology horizons were discovered  @xcite in addition to the well - known solutions : i.e. , the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole and the kerr@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole .",
    "for example , lemos constructed a static solution of an infinitely large planar black hole for the four - dimensional spacetime with @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "he also pointed out that the planar solution also represents the cylindrical black hole or the toruslike black hole by appropriate compactifications of this spacetime . by these procedures ,",
    "the topology of the black hole horizon becomes the cylinder ( @xmath3 ) or the torus ( @xmath4 ) , and conformal spacelike infinity has the same topology as the horizon .",
    "lemos generalized his static cylindrical black hole solution to the rotating one  @xcite .",
    "the generalization including charge and dilaton can be found in  @xcite .",
    "there exists another solution of the black hole with unusual topology .",
    "constructed a solution of a black hole whose horizon is a riemann two - surface and can take an arbitrary genus value @xmath5 by appropriate compactifications  @xcite .",
    "the topology of the conformal spacelike infinity is the same as that of the horizon due to this compactification .",
    "the generalization for the charged case can be found in  @xcite , and rotating topological black holes were introduced by klemm _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "readers might wonder why the black hole solutions with such various kinds of horizon topology exist even in four dimensions . the black hole topology theorem proved by hawking claims that the topology of the horizon is @xmath6",
    "but the assumptions of this theorem are that the spacetime is asymptotically flat and that certain energy conditions hold , which are both incompatible with the negative cosmological constant . in the presence of negative @xmath1 ,",
    "the black hole physics becomes far richer than the case of @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "there are some theorems that restrict black hole solutions in spacetimes with @xmath2 .",
    "_ proved that the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole is the unique static solution for asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter vacuum spacetimes with @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "proved some theorems that restrict the black hole solutions in @xmath2 spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that there would be a great possibility of the existence of unknown solution series .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the existence of the series of black hole solutions which describes a continuous change from the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole to the cylindrical or planar one .",
    "our expectation is easily understood by looking at the recent study of black strings and black holes in higher - dimensional kaluza - klein spacetimes .",
    "gregory and laflamme analyzed the stability of the black string in higher - dimensional spacetime  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the black string is unstable for a perturbation along the string , if the wavelength is sufficiently large .",
    "it was also shown that there is a static perturbation , which was a strong implication for the existence of a new sequence of static solutions .",
    "this static perturbation was investigated in detail by gubser  @xcite , and subseqently wiseman  @xcite and kudoh and wiseman  @xcite numerically solved the sequence that connects the black string to the black hole in higher - dimensional kaluza - klein spacetime .",
    "we can expect that a similar situation would occur in four - dimensional @xmath2 spacetimes .",
    "motivated by this expectation , we analyze the static perturbation of the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter spacetime as a starting point .",
    "the existence of such solutions is the manifestation of the existence of the new solution series .",
    "we consider the axisymmetric , even - parity perturbations in the regge - wheeler formalism  @xcite .",
    "each component of the metric perturbation is represented by a product of a radial function and legendre s polynomial @xmath8 . in the case of @xmath7 ,",
    "the solution diverges either at the horizon or at infinity  @xcite . if @xmath2 , however , it is possible to construct a solution which does not diverge everywhere from the horizon to infinity for all multipole modes corresponding to @xmath9  .",
    "the horizon of the perturbed solution is not geometrically spherical .",
    "hence we call this solution a deformed black hole hereafter . because some radial functions of the perturbation components asymptote to constant values at spacelike infinity ,",
    "our solution is not asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter : a two - surface at spacelike infinity is also deformed .",
    "this is consistent with the uniqueness theorem of anderson _ et al .",
    "_ however , our solution still describes the weakly asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter spacetime , in the sense of the ashtekar - magnon definition  @xcite .",
    "our result also does not contradict the theorems derived by galloway _",
    "et al . _    to understand the physical implication of the black hole deformation",
    ", we would like to discuss some features of this solution such as the mass , the horizon area , and the first law of black hole thermodynamics . because some of the metric coefficients diverge at infinity and to take a limit to infinity is a delicate problem , there are ambiguities in defining the mass of the spacetime with @xmath2 . several mass definitions in the asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter spacetimes have been proposed ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and some of them are applicable also to the weakly asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter spacetimes . among these",
    ", we use two well - known mass definitions proposed by abbott and deser  @xcite and by ashtekar and magnon  @xcite , which can be easily applied to deformed black holes .",
    "the first - order perturbation deforms the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole without changing the two masses and the horizon area .",
    "hence we should consider the @xmath10 mode of the second - order perturbation , which is generated by the terms of a product of two first - order perturbation components in the second - order equation .",
    "the two definitions give totally different results for the mass derived from the second - order perturbation .",
    "the abbott - deser mass diverges to minus infinity , while the ashtekar - magnon mass gives a finite value . as we will discuss in detail later",
    ", this result would be due to the fact that the abbott - deser mass is not gauge invariant at second order .",
    "since the definition of the ashtekar - magnon mass is covariant , it would provide a real amount of energy contained in the spacetime with a deformed black hole .",
    "therefore we expect that quasistatic deformation of the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole occurs with a finite change in the total energy and thus an investigation of the thermodynamic first law of the deformed black holes with this mass definition is meaningful .",
    "one can easily find that the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black holes obey the thermodynamic laws like asymptotically flat black holes .",
    "the first law was extended to the static black holes with unusual topology by vanzo  @xcite .",
    "he used the mass defined as the on - shell value of the hamiltonian , which gives the same value as the abbott - deser mass , and showed that the first law holds with this mass definition .",
    "it was explicitly shown that the first law with the usual form also holds for the kerr@xmath0newman@xmath0anti - de sitter black holes  @xcite , and there are some approaches to the proof of the first law for the asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter , stationary black hole spacetimes under more general assumptions  @xcite .",
    "we will analyze the first law of the deformed black holes as follows .",
    "there are two characteristic scales for these spacetimes : i.e. , the schwarzschild radius @xmath11 and the anti@xmath0de sitter radius @xmath12 .",
    "we analytically consider the case that the schwarzschild radius is much smaller than the anti@xmath0de sitter radius ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) and the case that the schwarzschild radius is much larger than the anti@xmath0de sitter radius ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) .",
    "then we numerically solve the @xmath15 cases .",
    "we will explicitly construct the solutions for the first - order perturbation and calculate the horizon area and the ashtekar - magnon mass .",
    "our calculation shows that the first law in the usual form approximately holds for the @xmath14 case , and it does not hold for the other cases .",
    "in other words , the first law has a correction term which can be interpreted as the work term necessary for the deformation of the two boundary surfaces of the spacetime : i.e. , the horizon and two - surface at spacelike infinity .",
    "if we compare the horizon area of the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole and that of the deformed black hole under the same mass , the latter becomes larger .",
    "therefore deformation of the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole will be claimed to be a process compatible with the usual area law .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the equations for a static , axisymmetric perturbation of schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter spacetime . we show that there exists a solution for the first - order perturbation which does not diverge everywhere , and that this spacetime is the weakly asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter spacetime .",
    "then we derive the second - order equation for the @xmath10 mode and the general formula for the horizon area of the deformed black hole . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the general formulas of the abbott - deser mass and the ashtekar - magnon mass for the deformed black holes .",
    "we discuss the property of these two definitions and show that the abbott - deser mass is not gauge invariant . in sec .",

    "vi , we summarize our results and discuss their physical implications .",
    "in this section , we derive the static , axisymmetric perturbation of the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole .",

    "we use this regge - wheeler - like gauge for an investigation of the deformed black holes .",
    "we give the first - order perturbation as @xmath27 where the first equality in eq .",
    "is imposed by the difference of @xmath28 , @xmath29 components of the einstein equation @xmath30 .",
    "we restrict our attention to @xmath31 , because @xmath10 and @xmath32 modes are absorbed to the coordinate transformation and the changing of the mass .",

    "we have introduced the horizon radius @xmath52 , which is the maximum solution of @xmath53 .",
    "thus , if we choose @xmath48 near the horizon , the solution @xmath41 becomes regular everywhere because it behaves like @xmath54 at large @xmath38 .",

    "the ratio of @xmath57 and @xmath58 is determined by imposing the regularity at the horizon .",
    "using eq .  , we see that the behavior of @xmath42 at infinity becomes @xmath60 where the coefficients can be determined using eq .   as follows : @xmath61 thus , @xmath42 is also finite at @xmath62 .",

    ", approximately holds for all @xmath17 .",
    "we can construct another quantity which has the same order as @xmath245 as follows : @xmath310 according to this formula , the work term normalized by the horizon radius depends only on two factors .",

    "the other factor depends on the values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are related to the deformation of the horizon and spacelike infinity , respectively . because the deformation of the two boundary surfaces becomes similar @xmath311 for larger @xmath17 , the absolute value of the work term decreases with an increase of @xmath17 .",
    "conversely , it becomes large with a decrease in @xmath17 , which corresponds to a decrease in @xmath279 .",
    "hence we interpret that the origin of the work term is related to the difference of the deformation between the two boundary surfaces of the spacetime .",
    "the work would be necessary for the deformation of both horizon and spacelike infinity , and their difference would appear in the first law as the work term .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the static deformation of the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black holes using perturbative techniques .",
    "we showed that there exists a regular solution for the first - order perturbation .",
    "the resulting spacetime contains the deformed black hole whose horizon deviates from the geometrically spherically symmetric surface .",
    "the spacelike infinity of this spacetime is deformed simultaneously .",
    "hence this spacetime is not asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter , although this is still weakly asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter in the sense of the ashtekar - magnon definition  @xcite . in the @xmath16 case ,",
    "the deformation of the horizon is about @xmath312 times smaller than the deformation of spacelike infinity , while the deformations of the two are similar in the @xmath14 case .",

    "the abbott - deser mass for the deformed black hole diverges to minus infinity . if this result is realistic , we are forced to conclude that the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole would rapidly deform toward the lower - energy state . but this definition is not gauge invariant at second order and we consider that this result may be spurious . because the ashtekar - magnon mass is a covariant definition of the mass from which we obtained finite results , we expect that it represents a real amount of energy although one assumption is imposed in eq .   in choosing the norm of @xmath192 .",
    "our results indicate that the quasistatic deformation of the spacetime boundaries may occur with a finite change in the total energy in the weakly asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter spacetimes . of course only with the analysis in this paper",
    ", we can not rigorously conclude that such a process actually occurs .",
    "but our expectation that the spacetime boundaries are flexible is also supported by the fact that no one has proved that spacelike infinity of the weakly asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter spacetime should be rigid ; i.e. , it has a global timelike conformal killing vector field",
    ". there might exist many weakly asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter solutions whose geometrical configuration at spacelike infinity temporally evolves .",

    "the first law in the usual form is approximately recovered , while in the @xmath16 case , the first law does not hold : the contribution of the work term @xmath245 becomes important . in sec .",
    "v , we numerically calculated this work term in the range @xmath313 for @xmath314 and confirmed that it is always negative in this regime .",
    "let us discuss the implications of this first law from the viewpoint of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "although the ratio of @xmath137 and @xmath132 is fixed for each @xmath17 in secs .",
    "iv and v , we can consider these parameters to be independent if we further take account of the thermodynamical relation of the background schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter spacetime , @xmath315 .",
    "the first law for the deformation process is given by @xmath316 with @xmath317 for two independent parameters @xmath241 and @xmath128 . if the deformation process occurs without changing the horizon area ( i.e. , @xmath318 and @xmath319 ) , the black hole mass decreases ( i.e. , @xmath320 ) and the black hole evolves towards the lower - energy state .",
    "hence the deformation may work as a process of energy extraction from a spherical black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is a deformation process in which the black hole mass does not change , the negative work term implies that the horizon area of the deformed black hole increases in this process .",
    "this indicates that quasistatic deformation can be a process consistent with the area theorem .",

    ", we discuss the reason why the work term is negative using the hartle - hawking formula @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) . using the raychaudhuri equation , hartle and hawking derived the following formula for an increase in the horizon area in the quasistationary evolution of a black hole : @xmath321 where @xmath322 and @xmath323 denote the time for the initial state and final state , respectively",

    "this formula is equivalent to the thermodynamic first law .",
    "if matter crosses the horizon and the flow of gravitational wave energy can be ignored , the second term of the integral in eq .",

    "the important fact is that the shear @xmath324 is @xmath330 in this case , and hence all @xmath128 , @xmath327 , and @xmath328 have the same order @xmath331 .",
    "the first term of the integral in eq .   can not be ignored , and introducing an unknown positive parameter @xmath332 , the work term and mass term may be given by @xmath333 which requires the work term to be negative .",

    "this arbitrariness in choosing the infinity structure would lead to great degrees of freedom of the solution series of deformed black holes .",
    "the condition for the existence of a solution due to the choice of infinity structure is of interest .",
    "next , we should analyze the stability of spacetimes with deformed black holes .",
    "this will require an analysis of the quasinormal frequency of the deformed black holes .",
    "at the same time , we would like to analyze the perturbation from the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole which gives the time - dependent geometrical configuration at spacelike infinity . with this analysis ,",
    "what spacetime is an attractor of the weakly asymptotically anti@xmath0de sitter spacetimes might become clear . concerning the application of these spacetimes with deformed black holes ,",
    "these solutions might contribute to the brane world scenario .",

    "hence , by appropriate cutting and pasting , these spacetimes might provide interesting models of the brane world scenario .",

    "<S> using perturbative techniques , we investigate the existence and properties of a new static solution for the einstein equation with a negative cosmological constant , which we call the deformed black hole . </S>",

    "<S> the key result is that this perturbation simultaneously deforms the two boundary surfaces  </S>",

    "<S> then we discuss the abbott - deser mass and the ashtekar - magnon one for the deformed black hole , and according to the ashtekar - magnon definition , we construct the thermodynamic first law of the deformed black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the first law has a correction term which can be interpreted as the work term that is necessary for the deformation of the boundary surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> because the work term is negative , the horizon area of the deformed black hole becomes larger than that of the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole , if compared under the same mass , indicating that the quasistatic deformation of the schwarzschild@xmath0anti - de sitter black hole may be compatible with the thermodynamic second law ( i.e. , the area theorem ) . </S>"
