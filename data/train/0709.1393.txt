    "the study of in - medium properties of light vector mesons is a topic of great importance for hadron and heavy - ion physics . besides the hope to get information on the mechanism of how hadrons acquire their masses ,",
    "the in - medium modifications are related to the chiral symmetry restoration and changes of the qcd vacuum structure @xcite .",
    "otherwise , vector mesons decaying into @xmath2 pairs can provide unique information about the evolution of nuclear matter in relativistic heavy - ion collisions as a penetrating probe , not suffering final state interactions @xcite .",
    "vector meson properties may not only be changed in compressed and heated strongly interacting matter but also at normal baryon density and zero temperature .",
    "we will concentrate on the properties of the @xmath1 meson being a hadron with a small decay width thus providing a unique probe for the expected in - medium modifications .",
    "the interaction of the @xmath1 meson with surrounding nucleons , nucleon resonances , and exchange - meson currents are thought to lead to modifications of @xmath1 meson propagating in a nucleus .",
    "first experimental results of such modifications have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . much theoretical",
    "work has been devoted for an evaluation of the @xmath1 meson self - energy as key quantity for the prediction of spectral properties .",
    "the calculations point to an increase of @xmath1 width reflecting the opening of new inelastic channels .",
    "but the predictions for the @xmath1 spectral function , often condensed into one quantity  the mass ,",
    "are wildly differing in different models as the scale ( and even the sign ) of the mass modification depends on the assumed dynamics of the @xmath1 interaction with the ambient nuclear medium .",
    "for instance , the models of refs .",
    "@xcite predict a shift of the peak position of the @xmath1 spectral function to lower energy , whereas results of some other approaches @xcite show an upward shift .    as a rule ,",
    "the available estimates of the self - energy are made within the low - energy theorem @xcite , where the in - medium part of the self - energy is expressed through the @xmath3 forward scattering amplitude .",
    "in fact , in different models , different components and channels of the @xmath4 amplitude are assumed to be important .",
    "for simplicity , in the following discussion we limit our considerations to the contribution of such baryon resonances which seem to be dominant not only in the compton @xmath4 scattering amplitude but also in @xmath1 production in photon - nucleon @xcite , meson - nucleon @xcite and proton - proton ( @xmath5 ) reactions @xcite near the threshold of @xmath1 .    in different models ,",
    "different resonances become dominant . thus , for example , for @xmath1 meson production in @xmath6 reactions , ref .",

    ", it would be nice to have , together with the position and width of the resonance in the current - current correlation function , additional observables being sensitive to the dynamics of the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "one possible candidate is the asymmetry of the di - electron angular or energy distribution related to the difference of the transverse and longitudinal parts of the @xmath1 meson self - energy in a nuclear medium .",
    "this difference disappears for the @xmath1 meson at rest ( relative to the nuclear medium ) and becomes finite for a finite @xmath1 meson momentum @xmath14 .",
    "high - spin resonances can be excited only by the orbital interaction , and therefore , they do not contribute at @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath16 increases , they become important .",
    "the dependence of the transverse and longitudinal parts of the partial amplitudes on the @xmath1 meson mass and momentum and , therefore , the asymmetry between transverse and longitudinal parts of the current - current correlation function may be used as a tool for fixing the mechanism of the relevant @xmath4 interaction .",
    "this has a practical aspect since most of experiments studying the in - medium @xmath1 meson properties are dealing with non - zero @xmath1 meson momenta .",
    "the aim of our paper is the discussion of an example of such an asymmetry .",
    "we introduce the asymmetry between the transverse and longitudinal parts of the current - current correlation function and , as mere illustration , we apply it to a simple resonance model of the @xmath4 scattering .",

    "then , the @xmath1 meson propagates in the nuclear medium of the target nucleus @xmath19 and afterwards decays into a electron - positron pair .",
