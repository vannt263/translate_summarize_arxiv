    "there are many 6d superconformal field theories ( scfts ) engineered from string theory .",
    "the first examples were the maximally supersymmetric @xmath8 scfts of @xmath9 types , discovered in @xcite from considering iib string theory compactified on k3 .",
    "the @xmath10-type theory governs the low energy dynamics of parallel and overlapping @xmath11 m5-branes @xcite .",
    "vast number of @xmath12 scfts were found from f - theory compactified on elliptic calabi - yau 3-folds as well as from branes at low energy @xcite .",
    "the classification of 6d @xmath0 scfts has been recently explored in @xcite .",
    "the tensor branch of each 6d @xmath0 scft can be described in terms of tensor multiplets , hypermultiplets , and vector multiplets .",
    "when there exists a gauge symmetry , the gauge anomaly should vanish .",
    "each tensor multiplet can have self - dual strings .",
    "they are the sources for the 2-form tensor field @xmath13 of the tensor multiplet , whose field strength @xmath14 respects the self - duality @xmath15 .",
    "their tensions are proportional to the vev of a tensor multiplet scalar .",
    "one interesting example is the self - dual strings of the 6d @xmath16 @xmath10 scft , which can be described by m2-branes connecting any two m5-branes of @xmath11 m5-branes @xcite .",
    "they are the so - called ` m - strings ' which have been studied in various literatures such as @xcite .",
    "another typical example is the self - dual strings of the 6d @xmath0 scft with @xmath3 global symmetry , being induced from m2-branes connecting m5-branes to an @xmath3 boundary wall of m - theory on @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "these so - called ` e - strings ' have been studied in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we shall often use the terminologies ` m - string theory ' and ` e - string theory ' to refer the @xmath16 @xmath10 scft and the @xmath0 scft with @xmath3 flavor symmetry , respectively .",
    "there are a lot of 6d @xmath0 scfts with gauge symmetries . when a gauge group @xmath18 is semi - simple , @xcite search for all possible gauge theories being free of gauge anomaly .",
    "if one considers some low - rank simple groups , i.e. , @xmath19 and @xmath1 , the allowed matter contents are given by @xmath20 apart from the minimal @xmath1 case with @xmath21 , the above theories are obtained by enhancing m - string and e - string theories with gauge symmetries and extra matters .",
    "one can consult @xcite for further possible enhancements of m - string and e - string theories found from f - theory construction . in this paper",
    ", we shall focus on the following sequences of 6d scfts : @xmath22 which are connected by higgs mechanism .",
    "our main interest in this work is to study the physics of self - dual strings in these theories by constructing their 2d gauge theory description . for each sequence of 6d scfts",
    ", we shall find a class of 2d gauge theories which provides a uniform description of self - dual strings .",
    "`` decorations '' of the basic 6d scfts and self - dual strings , such as m - strings and e - strings , by 6d gauge symmetries and matters are important to fully understand the recent classification @xcite better . and also",
    ", we shall discover new gauge theory description of e - strings themselves , which will exhibit some strong coupling properties of these strings more transparently than @xcite . recall that e - string theory is engineered from m5-branes probing an @xmath3 wall , which is also called m9-brane .",
    "the m9-brane worldvolume has 4 transverse directions to m5-branes , rotated by the @xmath23 symmetry which can be decomposed into @xmath24 .",
    "while all @xmath25 charged states decouple from e - string theory on a single m5-brane , the @xmath25 refinement turns out crucial in case of multiple m5-branes .",
    "our new description of e - strings fully realizes both @xmath25 and @xmath26 in contrast to @xcite which only see @xmath27 , enabling us to study the refined spectrum of multiple m5-branes probing an m9-brane in section  [ sec : multiple - m5-branes ] .",
    "let us explain a useful bottom - up approach for finding the 2d gauge theories for self - dual strings .",
    "when a 6d scft has a gauge symmetry , the equation of motion for @xmath13 is given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the field strength of a gauge field , and @xmath30 is a positive constant which depends on a theory @xcite .",
    "self - dual strings are therefore regarded as instanton soliton strings in effective yang - mills description of 6d scfts in the tensor branch .",
    "these strings carry nonzero integer charges of @xmath31 we shall consider self - dual instantons with @xmath32 in this paper .",
    "this integral is taken over the @xmath33 space transverse to the string worldsheet .",
    "if one applies the moduli space approximation to describe the low energy excitations on these strings , the dynamics of self - dual strings are described by non - linear sigma models , whose target space is given by the instanton moduli space @xmath34 .",
    "the space @xmath34 has singular locus at which the instanton size shrinks to zero .",
    "this small instanton singularity reflects the uv incompleteness of the 6d effective yang - mills theory .",
    "although it is difficult to deal with the singular target space , the adhm construction @xcite often tells us the sensible uv completions of the non - linear sigma models . with the guidance from the adhm construction ,",
    "one may obtain 2d @xmath4 adhm gauge theories which are weakly coupled in the uv regime .",
    "the instanton moduli space @xmath34 reappears in the higgs branch of the adhm gauge theory @xcite away from the points where the instanton scale becomes zero .",
    "one main problem that we discuss in section  [ sec : strings - from - branes ] is that the adhm construction sometimes leads us to 2d gauge theories that suffer from gauge anomaly .",
    "while there is no such issue for self - dual strings in the sequence to m - strings , this happens when we consider 6d scfts in the higgsing chain to e - string theory .",
    "we find anomaly - free gauge theories by suitably modifying the naive adhm gauge theories , which include the same 6d instanton zero modes .",
    "these anomaly - free theories have the desired non - linear sigma models on @xmath34 away from the small instanton singularity , but provide a uv completion at the singularity .",
    "one important feature is that some global symmetries which we expect on the self - dual strings are partly broken in these gauge theories .",
    "namely , the 6d symmetries @xmath35 are sometimes partially present in the 2d gauge theories .",
    "the elliptic genera of these consistent 2d theories capture the bps excitations on self - dual strings and remain valid in the strong coupling low energy limit where the 6d global symmetries should get manifest .",
    "the calculation of the elliptic genera and showing the global symmetry enhancement in the index functions are done in sections  [ sec : ir - dynamics - symmetry ]  and  [ sec : multiple - m5-branes ] .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : strings - from - branes ] , we construct 2d anomaly - free gauge theories for self - dual strings in 6d scfts listed at and .",
    "we check that they show the ir symmetry enhancements by computing the gauge theory elliptic genera in section  [ sec : ir - dynamics - symmetry ] .",
    "section  [ sec : multiple - m5-branes ] is devoted to study e - string theories with higher dimensional tensor branches , i.e. for multiple m5-branes probing an m9-brane .",
    "we obtain the fully flavored spectrum which refines the result of @xcite .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we construct the anomaly - free @xmath5 gauge theories for @xmath36 self - dual strings in the following sequences of 6d gauge theories : @xmath37 it is tightly related to finding a suitable uv completion of the non - linear sigma model with the singular target space . as this procedure",
    "has not been clearly understood , we shall refer to the string theory realization of 6d scfts and self - dual strings as our guide for a possible uv completion .",
    "the higgsable theories in are readily realized in type iia string theory .",
    "suppose that there exist @xmath38 overlapping d6-branes along the @xmath39 directions .",
    "two parallel ns5-branes along the @xmath40 directions are located on these d6 branes and separated in the @xmath41 direction .",
    "there are @xmath36 overlapping d2-branes along the @xmath42 directions connecting two ns5-branes .",
    "these branes are mutually bps and so preserve some supersymmetry .",
    "figure  [ fig : m - string - higgsing - sequence ] shows the brane set - up .    the 7d @xmath43 susy gauge theory on @xmath38 d6-branes implies that the low energy physics between two ns5-branes is described by the 6d @xmath0 @xmath44 gauge theory with @xmath45 fundamental hypermultiplets , which is coupled to the tensor multiplet from the relative motion of two ns5-branes .",
    "the reduction mechanism of the 6d gauge group from @xmath43 to @xmath44 is explained in @xcite .",
    "the 6d @xmath46 gauge symmetry with charged matters was anomalous , as only hypermultiplets could contribute to the @xmath46 gauge anomaly .",
    "one can however obtain a sensible theory through the ` linear hypermultiplet ' having four scalars @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which correspond to the position coordinates of ns5-branes along @xmath49 and m - circle directions .",
    "the @xmath47 appear as parameters in the d - term and the @xmath48 appears as @xmath50 .",
    "the kinetic terms for linear hypermultiplet scalars are given by @xcite @xmath51 where the @xmath46 gauge invariance requires @xmath48 to transform as @xmath52 under @xmath53 .",
    "this shows that the @xmath46 gauge field is massive and the @xmath46 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the low energy physics is therefore governed by the @xmath44 gauge theory with @xmath45 fundamental hypermultiplets .",
    "this 6d theory is anomaly - free .",
    "instanton strings of the 6d @xmath44 gauge theory are also self - dual strings of the tensor multiplet .",
    "these self - dual strings are realized as @xmath36 d2-brane segments connecting two ns5-branes , lying along the @xmath42 directions and on top of the @xmath38 d6-branes .",
    "the separation of two ns5-brane is taken to be very short , so the worldvolume theory of @xmath36 d2-branes becomes effectively given by the 2d supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "the d6- and ns5-branes preserve @xmath54 global symmetry , which is further decomposed to @xmath55 due to the presence of d2-branes . here",
    "@xmath56 is the r - symmetry of 6d @xmath0 susy .",
    "we now examine the preserved supercharges in this system .",
    "let us denote the doublet indices of @xmath57 symmetry by @xmath58 .",
    "32 supercharges of type iia string theory are decomposed into @xmath59 and @xmath60 , in which the two @xmath61 subscripts denote eigenvalues of @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "introduction of d2 , d6 , ns5-branes imposes the susy projectors @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , so that 4 supercharges @xmath67 are preserved .",
    "since @xmath67 have a definite 2d chirality , they form the @xmath68 susy whose r - symmetry corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "we summarize the field contents of 2d @xmath5 gauge theory in figure  [ fig:2d - m - string - quiver ] , which are determined from massless modes of open strings connecting d2-d2 and d2-d6 .",
    "these match with the adhm construction . in @xmath5 quiver diagrams , we draw a solid line to represent a @xmath5 hypermultiplet ( either twisted or untwisted ) and a dashed line to represent a @xmath5 fermi multiplet .",
    "we make a few comments on the adhm gauge theory .",
    "first , the adhm gauge theory is originally intended for the @xmath43 instantons instead of @xmath44 .",
    "it involves extra degrees of freedom , regularizing singular @xmath46 instantons @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath4 chiral susys are preserved so that one should check if the adhm gauge theory is sensible by looking at a gauge anomaly . in the @xmath5 susy",
    ", fermions are right - moving if they are in hypermultiplets , and left - moving if they are in vector or fermi multiplets . using the normalization @xmath70 ,",
    "the gauge anomaly is proportional to @xmath71 which vanishes at @xmath72 .",
    "we also need to consider a mixed anomaly between gauge and global symmetries .",
    "let us denote the abelian generators of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 by @xmath18 , @xmath29 , and @xmath76 .",
    "gauge - global mixed anomalies are given as follows .",
    "@xmath77 these imply that the 2d quantum theory at @xmath78 preserves the @xmath46 combination @xmath79 of @xmath80 only .",
    "third , there exists the fake @xmath46 symmetry generated by @xmath81 , which rotates no fields in the theory .    in the above brane",
    "set - up , the higgs mechanism can be regarded as a process of decreasing the number of d6-branes .",
    "if @xmath38 reaches to be @xmath82 , the 6d scft no longer has a gauge symmetry .",
    "the m - theory uplift of the brane configuration is simply two m5-branes supported at the origin of taub - nut . in this case",
    ", the adhm gauge theory turns out to be the @xmath5 gauge theory description for m - strings introduced in @xcite .",
    "a further higgsing removes the last d6-brane , leaving @xmath36 d2-branes suspended between two ns5-branes .",
    "it is also uplifted to m - theory as a pair of parallel m5-branes .",
    "the susy gauge theory on d2-branes then becomes 2d @xmath83 @xmath84 gauge theory again describing m - strings . in order to study the spectrum of m - string theory , we prefer the @xmath5 description to the @xmath83 description .",
    "it is because only the first one realizes the @xmath23 global symmetry of m - string theory , which rotates 4 transverse directions to m5-branes .",
    "let us decompose it into @xmath85 . at @xmath86",
    ", @xmath26 appears as a part of @xmath5 r - symmetry , and also @xmath25 appears as a @xmath87 global symmetry . at @xmath88 , only @xmath27",
    "is realized as a subgroup of @xmath23 r - symmetry in @xmath5 susy .",
    "we now move to the higgsing sequence to the e - string theory .",
    "the 6d @xmath1 and @xmath2 scfts in have 6 more fundamental hypermultiplets than those 6d scfts in .",
    "as a 6d fundamental hypermultiplet induces a @xmath5 fermi multiplet in the 2d adhm construction , one may naively attempt to describe @xmath36 self - dual strings by adding 6 more fermi multiplets to figure  [ fig:2d - m - string - quiver ] .",
    "however , this trial immediately fails because a gauge anomaly vanishes only if @xmath72 .",
    "instead , we make the following observations :    * @xmath1 fundamental hypermultiplets are not distinguishable from @xmath89 hypermultiplets .",
    "they induce the same instanton zero mode",
    ". nevertheless , they supply different degrees of freedom which are supported at the small instanton singularity in the instanton moduli space . * @xmath2 antisymmetric hypermultiplets decouple from the rest of perturbative dynamics",
    ". however , inclusion of antisymmetric hypermultiplets changes the way of resolving the singularity in the instanton moduli space , by providing extra degrees of freedom supported at the singular locus .",
    "here we take first the empirical approach in order to find a sensible uv completion of the 2d system .",
    "introduction of a single 6d @xmath44 antisymmetric hypermultiplet supplies a single set of the following 2d @xmath5 supermultiplets @xcite :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     where the @xmath49 and @xmath90 directions were taken to be @xmath91 with a radius @xmath92 . in the 11d limit @xmath93 , e - string theory has the global @xmath94 symmetry which rotates four transverse directions . on the other hand ,",
    "the iia system in @xcite was obtained by the @xmath95 limit which reduces the @xmath96 circle .",
    "note that the @xmath3 wilson line is required to reach the iia configuration , replacing the m9 by the o8@xmath97 and 8 d8 branes . even though the @xmath96 direction would be decompactified in the infrared regime of 2d gauge theory through the following relation @xmath98",
    ", one could not capture the @xmath94 flavored spectrum due to a missing cartan in the iia set - up .",
    "in fact , @xcite computed the @xmath99 flavored spectrum where @xmath99 is identified as the diagonal subgroup @xmath100 . for a single m5-brane",
    ", it does not matter because 5d @xmath101 instanton calculus , which we explain below , shows that the bps spectrum itself does not include @xmath25 charged states @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 charged states begin to appear at @xmath102 .",
    "5d @xmath103 instanton calculus tells us that the bps spectrum would be a product of @xmath104 @xmath101 partition functions if not refined with the @xmath25 global symmetry @xcite , which happens because many bps states cancel to 0 in the elliptic genus without @xmath25 refinement .",
    "this calls for a new description in which the @xmath94 symmetry is fully visible .",
    "we can instead take the @xmath49 and @xmath90 directions to be taub - nut .",
    "m5-branes are supported at the origin of taub - nut , which locally looks like @xmath105 .",
    "the iia brane set - up in figure  [ fig : multiple - ns5-brane ] is obtained in the limit which reduces the taub - nut circle .",
    "again , it is required to turn on the @xmath3 wilson line along a reduced circle , breaking @xmath3 to @xmath106 symmetry .",
    "even though both iia systems in @xcite and figure  [ fig : multiple - ns5-brane ] reach to the same e - string theory in the strong coupling regime , the iia system in figure  [ fig : multiple - ns5-brane ] is more favorable because it realize both @xmath25 and @xmath26 cartans as a part of flavor symmetry and the r - symmetry of 6d @xmath0 susy .",
    "it makes our 2d gauge theory , introduced in figure  [ fig : e - string - multiple - quiver ] , more useful when we study the fully refined spectrum of e - string theory .",
    "let us explain how 5d @xmath103 instanton calculus describes e - string theory .",
    "if one chooses one of @xmath107 directions , shared by m5 and m9-branes , to be a circle @xmath108 while keeping @xmath49 and @xmath90 directions as non - compact @xmath105 , the iia brane system can be obtained by reducing @xmath108 along which the @xmath3 wilson line is turned on .",
    "m5-branes are mapped to d4-branes .",
    "m9-brane is replaced by 8 d8-branes on top of the o8@xmath97 plane , carrying the @xmath106 symmetry .",
    "the low energy dynamics of @xmath104 d4-branes is described by 5d @xmath103 gauge theory .",
    "it has @xmath109 fundamental and @xmath82 antisymmetric hypermultiplets .",
    "a remarkable fact is that certain 5d gauge theories essentially capture 6d physics by incorporating non - perturbative objects called instantons @xcite .",
    "recall that the low energy dynamics of 5d sym instantons are uv - completed as d0-branes on d4-branes in string theory .",
    "as d0-branes are kaluza - klein momenta along the m - theory circle , one can interpret 5d sym instantons as kaluza - klein momenta of a circle compactified 6d scft .",
    "this relation has been confirmed in certain examples .",
    "for example , the instanton partition function of 5d @xmath110 sym displays the tensor branch spectrum of 6d m - string theory @xcite . along the same line , the instanton partition function of 5d @xmath111 @xmath101 gauge theory agrees with the tensor branch spectrum of 6d e - string theory on a single m5-brane @xcite .",
    "one can surely extend this relation to e - string theory on @xmath104 m5-branes , obtaining 5d @xmath103 gauge theory on @xmath104 d4-branes .",
    "the precise relation between the 5d @xmath103 instanton partition function and the 6d tensor branch spectrum is explained in @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to @xcite when we compare the elliptic genera of the gauge theory in figure  [ fig : e - string - multiple - quiver ] with the 5d @xmath103 instanton partition function .",
    "below we are going to compute the elliptic genera of 2d gauge theories in figure  [ fig:2d - quiver ] and figure  [ fig : e - string - multiple - quiver ] .",
    "the point of this computation is verifying the @xmath3 symmetry enhancement .",
    "for the latter case , we content ourselves with the sample computation at @xmath112 which will be compared with the 5d @xmath113 instanton partition function @xcite .",
    "[ [ one - m5-brane ] ] one m5-brane + + + + + + + + + + + +    at @xmath114 , we bring the @xmath115 and @xmath116 elliptic genera computed in section  [ sec : ir - dynamics - symmetry ] .",

    "taking advantage of the @xmath119 branching rules , e.g. , @xmath120 the bps spectrum at @xmath115 can be organized into @xmath3 representations as follows .",
