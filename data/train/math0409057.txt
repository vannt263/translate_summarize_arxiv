    "this note reports on recent progress made in @xcite on the study of the two dimensional navier  stokes equation driven by an additive stochastic forcing . recall that the navier  stokes equation describes the time evolution of an incompressible fluid . in vorticity form , it is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 , the two - dimensional torus @xmath3 \\times [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] , @xmath4 is the viscosity constant , @xmath5 is a white - in - time stochastic forcing to be specified below , and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the biot - savart integral operator which will be defined next .",
    "first , we define a convenient basis in which we will perform all explicit calculations . setting @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", we define a real fourier basis for functions on @xmath11 with zero spatial mean by @xmath12 write @xmath13 for the expansion of the solution in this basis . with this notation , in the two - dimensional periodic setting , @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "see for example @xcite for more details on the deterministic vorticity formulation in a periodic domain .",
    "we use the vorticity formulation for simplicity , but all of our results can easily be translated into statements about the velocity formulation of the problem .",
    "we solve on the space @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath17 , we define the norms @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ".    the emphasis of this note will be on forcing which directly excites only a few degrees of freedom .",
    "such forcing is both of primary modeling interest and is technically the most difficult .",
    "specifically we consider forcing of the form @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a finite subset of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a collection of mutually independent standard scalar brownian motions on a probability space @xmath25 .",
    "the note describes two sets of results contained in two papers by two different subsets of the authors . in the first , mattingly and pardoux @xcite give conditions ensuring that any projection of the time @xmath26 transition probability of the solution of onto a finite dimensional subspace has a @xmath27 density with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "the result is based on the malliavin calculus . under additional conditions ,",
    "this density is shown to be everywhere positive .",
    "the techniques developed are quite general and we expect they can be applied to many nonlinear , stochastic partial differential equations with additive noise . these results provide a first step towards a truly infinite dimensional version of hrmanders celebrated `` sum of squares '' theorem @xcite .    in the second paper , hairer and mattingly @xcite give necessary and sufficient conditions for the main results and estimates of @xcite to hold .",
    "they then use these tools to build a theory which , when applied to , proves that it has a unique invariant measure under extremely general and essentially sharp assumptions .",
    "in addition to the tools from @xcite , they introduce new concept and tool which together provide an abstract framework in which the ergodicity of is proven .",
    "the concept is a generalization of the strong feller property for a markov process which , for reasons that will be made clear below , is called the _",
    "asymptotic strong feller _ property .",
    "the main feature of this property is that a diffusion which is irreducible and asymptotically strong feller can have at most one invariant measure .",
    "it thus yields a natural generalization of doob s theorem .",
    "the tool is an approximate integration by parts formula , in the sense of malliavin calculus , which is used to prove that the system enjoys the asymptotic strong feller property . to the best of the authors knowledge",
    ", this paper is the first to prove ergodicity of a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) under assumptions comparable to those assumed when studying finite dimensional stochastic differential equations .",
    "the ergodic theory of infinite dimensional stochastic systems , and spdes specifically , has been a topic of intense study over the last two decades . until recently",
    ", the forcing was always assumed to be elliptic and spatially rough . in our context",
    "this translates to @xmath28 and @xmath29 for some positive @xmath30 .",
    "flandoli and maslowski @xcite first proved ergodic results for under such assumptions .",
    "this line of inquiry was extended and simplified in @xcite .",
    "they represent a larger body of literature which characterizes the extent to which classical ideas developed for finite dimensional markov processes apply to infinite dimensional processes .",
    "principally they use tools from infinite dimensional stochastic analysis to prove that the processes are strong feller in an appropriate topology and then deduce ergodicity .",
    "next three groups of authors in @xcite , contemporaneously greatly expanded the cases known to be ergodic .",
    "they use the foias - prodi type reduction , first adapted to the stochastic setting in @xcite and the pathwise contraction of the high spatial frequencies already used in @xcite to prove ergodicity of at sufficiently high viscosity .",
    "all of the results hinged on the observation that if all of the unstable directions are stochastically perturbed , then the system could be shown to be ergodic . a general overview of these ideas with simple examples can be found in @xcite .",
    "these ideas have been continued in a number of papers .",
    "see for instance @xcite .    unfortunately , the best current estimates on the number of unstable directions in grow inversely with the viscosity @xmath31 .",
    "hence the physically important limit of @xmath32 while a fixed , finite scale is forced were previously outside the scope of the theory",
    ". however there existed strong indications that ergodicity held in this case . specifically in @xcite it was shown that the generator of the diffusion associated to finite dimensional galerkin approximations of was hypoelliptic in the sense of hrmander when only a few directions were forced .",
    "this hypoellipticity is the crucial ingredient in the proof of ergodicity from @xcite .",
    "the `` correct '' ergodic theorem needs to incorporate in its statement information on how the randomness spreads from the few forced directions to all of the unstable directions .",
    "this understanding when combined with what had been learned in @xcite should yield unique ergodicity .",
    "this is the program executed in the papers discussed in this note .",
    "the geometry of the forcing is encoded in the structure of @xmath21 from . as observed in @xcite ,",
    "its structure gives information about how the randomness is spread throughout phase space by the nonlinearity .",
    "define @xmath33 to be the symmetric , and hence translationally stationary part of the forcing set @xmath34 , given by @xmath35 . then define the collection @xmath36 and lastly",
    ", @xmath37    @xmath38 captures the directions to which the randomness has spread .",
    "this can be understood in the following way .",
    "denote by @xmath39 the partial derivative into the direction @xmath40 of the phase space and define ( on a formal level ) the first order differential operator @xmath41 by @xmath42 then the generator of the markov process associated to is formally given by @xmath43 note that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 if and only if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , all differential operators of the type @xmath39 with @xmath49 can be obtained as an iterated lie bracket of finite length involving @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "since we want to ensure that all of the unstable directions are stochastically agitated , we seek conditions where @xmath53 .",
    "the following essentially sharp characterization of this situation is given in @xcite .",
    "[ propz ] one has @xmath53 if and only if both :    1 .",
    "integer linear combinations of elements of @xmath33 generate @xmath22 .",
    "2 .   there exist at least two elements in @xmath33 with unequal euclidean norm .",
    "this characterization is sharp in the sense that if @xmath54 and one of the above two conditions fails , then there exists a non - trivial subspace of @xmath55 which is left invariant under the dynamics of .",
    "also notice that if @xmath56 then proposition [ propz ] implies that @xmath53 . hence forcing four well chosen modes",
    "is sufficient to have the randomness move through the entire system .",
    "of course one can also force a small number of modes center elsewhere than at the origin and obtain the same effect .",
    "the next two sections discuss the implications of @xmath57 .",
    "we define @xmath58 one of the main results of @xcite is the following :    [ thm : main ] for any @xmath59 and any finite dimensional subspace @xmath60 of @xmath61 , the law of the orthogonal projection @xmath62 of @xmath63 onto @xmath60 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath60 and has a @xmath27 density .    in @xcite , eckmann and hairer used malliavin calculus to prove a version of hrmander s `` sum of squares '' theorem for a particular spde and deduce ergodicity .",
    "however , all of the techniques of that paper required that the forcing excite all but a finite number of directions and that the forcing be spatially rough as in @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] builds on ideas introduced into malliavin calculus by ocone in @xcite .",
    "the central idea is an alternative representation of the malliavin matrix of using the time reversed adjoint of the linearization of .",
    "ocone used this representation when the spde was linear in the initial data and the forcing .",
    "when the noise is additive , @xcite extends that idea to the nonlinear case .",
    "let @xmath64 be the solution of linearization of at time @xmath26 with initial condition @xmath65 at time @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 denote the solution to the @xmath55-adjoint of the linearizion at time @xmath66 , @xmath67 , with terminal condition @xmath65 at time @xmath26 .",
    "since the equation is time reversed , the adjoint is well posed . with this notation , the so  called `` malliavin covariance matrix '' @xmath69",
    "can be represented by @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "the second of these representations is the one used in @xcite . because of the time reversal",
    ", the representation is not adapted to the filtration generated by @xmath72 and new estimates concerning anticipating stochastic processes are required to obtain the needed estimates .",
    "essentially one needs to show that the malliavin matrix is non - degenerate on the subspace @xmath60 and that the moments of the reciprocal of the norm of the malliavin matrix on this subspace are finite .",
    "this is accomplished through the following estimate which also gives information about the separation of the randomness on large and small scales .",
    "[ l : onephi ] let @xmath73 be the orthogonal projection of @xmath55 onto a finite dimensional subspace of @xmath61 . for any @xmath0 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 there exist two constants @xmath78 and @xmath79 such that for all @xmath80 $ ] , @xmath81 where @xmath82 .    with additional assumptions on the controllability of conditions are also given ensuring the strict positivity of the density .",
    "this extends results of ben arous and landre @xcite and aida , kusuoka and stroock @xcite to this setting .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the exact conditions and the details .",
    "recall that an _ invariant measure _ for is a probability measure @xmath83 on @xmath55 such that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the semigroup on measures dual to the markov transition semigroup @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 with @xmath88 . while the existence of an invariant measure for can be proved by `` soft '' techniques using the regularizing and dissipativity properties of the flow @xcite , showing its uniqueness is a more challenging problem that requires a detailed analysis of the nonlinearity .",
    "the importance of showing the uniqueness of @xmath83 is illustrated by the fact that it implies that @xmath89 for all bounded continuous functions @xmath90 and all initial conditions @xmath91 .",
    "it thus gives some mathematical ground to the _ ergodic assumption _ usually made in the physics literature when discussing the qualitative behavior of .",
    "the following theorem is the main result of @xcite .",
    "the concept of a strong feller markov process appears to be less useful in infinite dimensions than in finite dimensions . in particular",
    "if @xmath86 is strong feller , then the measures @xmath92 and @xmath93 are equivalent for all initial conditions @xmath94 .",
    "it is easy to construct an ergodic spde which does not satisfy this property .",
    "recall the following standard sufficient criteria for @xmath86 to be strong feller  : there exists a locally bounded function @xmath95 such that @xmath96 . while we will not give the exact definition of the asymptotic strong feller property here",
    ", the following similar condition implies that the process is asymptotically strong feller : there exists a locally bounded @xmath97 , a non - decreasing sequence of times @xmath98 , and a strictly decreasing sequence @xmath99 with @xmath100 so that @xmath101 and all @xmath102 . in applications",
    "one typically has @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the process behaves as if it acquired the strong feller property at time infinity , which justifies the term asymptotic strong feller .",
    "first observe that @xmath104 .",
    "next we seek a direction @xmath105 in the cameron - martin space so that if @xmath106 denotes the malliavin derivative in the direction @xmath105 then @xmath107 .",
    "in finite dimensions , we can often do this exactly ; however , in infinite dimensions we only know how to achieve this up to some error . setting @xmath108",
    ", we have the approximate integration by parts formula .",
    "@xmath109 +    { { \\mathbb{e}}}_{w}(\\nabla\\phi)({w}_t)\\rho_t\\\\    & = { { \\mathbb{e}}}_{w}\\phi({w}_t)\\int_0^t v_s dw_s +    { { \\mathbb{e}}}_{w}(\\nabla\\phi)({w}_t)\\rho_t\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this equality one can quickly deduce , provided @xmath110 and @xmath111 as @xmath112 . in @xcite , a @xmath113",
    "is chosen so that these conditions hold .",
    "the analysis is complicated by the fact that the @xmath113 constructed there is not adapted to the brownian filtration .",
