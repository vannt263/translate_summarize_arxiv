    "many - body approaches are crucial for a modern understanding and physical description of ultracold quantum gases .",
    "particularly , systems of strongly interacting ultracold atoms demand for theories that predict dynamic behavior and excitation spectra  @xcite .",
    "a system of major interest is the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . with its experimental realization",
    "@xcite a well - controllable mesoscopic quantum object is at hand offering ways to study many - body systems and excitations therein empirically . experimentally , owing to their controllability , excitations of becs have been widely explored  @xcite . at the same time",
    "tremendous theoretical efforts seek to account for the observed correlation phenomena and their proper many - body descriptions  @xcite .",
    "since analytic solutions to many - body problems are rare , numerical simulations are inevitable .    the most popular mean - field theory to treat becs in dilute",
    ", ultracold vapors is based upon the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite . within the gp approach all constituting bosons",
    "are assumed to occupy a single one - particle state , describing thereby a simple , i.e. , fully condensed and coherent condensate @xcite . clearly , whenever the bec is partially condensed , depleted , or multi - fold fragmented @xcite a single wave - function approach is insufficient . on physical side",
    "all these phenomena originate from strong interparticle interactions and multi - well topologies of the confining traps .",
    "experimentally , connections between strong interactions and quantum depletion have been established in  @xcite , the fragmentation phenomena in double - well traps have been observed in @xcite .",
    "first experimental realization of the mott insulator states in multi - well traps formed by optical lattices has been reported in  @xcite .",
    "on theoretical side to grasp depletion and fragmentation phenomena one has to go beyond the one - mode gp ansatz and use more complicated many - body theories where the bosonic wave - function is constructed with multiple ( one - particle ) orbital modes @xcite . in this paper to describe condensation , depletion and fragmentation phenomena in static setups and time - dependent processes on the same ground we use the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb )  @xcite , which is available within the mctdhb - laboratory package  @xcite .    the standard static , i.e. , time - independent approach to calculate excitation spectra of becs at the one - orbital mean - field level is to apply the linear response ( lr ) theory to the gp ground state .",
    "the underlying equations are often called bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg@xmath2lr - gp ) equations  @xcite .",
    "recently , the same linear - response idea was applied to the multi - orbital best mean - field  @xcite and many - body mctdhb  @xcite ground states allowing thereby to access excitations of the multi - fold fragmented becs at the mean - field and many - body levels .",
    "the invented  @xcite , developed  @xcite , generalized  @xcite and benchmarked  @xcite lr - mctdhb theory has allowed us to discover low - lying excitations in trapped systems which are not described within the bdg theory . as one might expect such states are present in fragmented systems  @xcite and , surprisingly , also in condensed systems  @xcite where bdg was believed to govern the physics .",
    "naturally , questions of interest concern the origin of many - body excited states , their properties and possible classification schemes . here ,",
    "we attempt to generalize characterization of the excitations obtained in the non - interacting case to the interacting systems .",
    "we also distinguish two kinds of many - body excitations - one branch describes collective excitations while the second one represents excitations involving multiple particles . these excitations will be defined and described in some detail below .",
    "another issue tackled in this paper is a dynamic control .",
    "the long - term perspective is to find dynamic protocols that allow for a controlled population of the desired excitations . within the framework of the mctdhb method this problem can ,",
    "in principle , be solved by applying the optimal - control theory as proposed in  @xcite and , more recently , by merging the general optimal - control chopped random basis ( crab ) algorithms  @xcite with the mctdhb method  @xcite . here , however , we present and consider two simple protocols that excite becs via sudden modification of the system s hamiltonian .",
    "such manipulations manifest in oscillation of the many - body wave - function , and thus the particle density , in time . in an experimental setup changes on the hamiltonian",
    "can be realized by introducing control fields , altering the confining potential or toggling the inter - particle interaction using feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "an open question is how to detect and verify many - body excitations confidently .",
    "a first step towards the answer is to find out which observables provide more detailed information about the many - body excitations .",

    "at the many - body level excitations may have a more complicated structure involving multiple particle excitations at the same time .",
    "for the harmonic regime ( @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec1 ] ) , excitations have been studied elsewhere  @xcite by decoupling relative and center - of - mass ( com ) motion .",

    "next , we would like to discuss the almost fully fragmented regime in a deep double - well trap ( @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec1 ] ) .",
    "one clearly observes the formation of band - like structures for the asymptotic limit where the energy difference between each pair ( green and red curves ) vanishes . in this limit of high barriers",
    "the entire excitation spectrum becomes two - fold degenerate and the ground state of the many - body system is two - fold fragmented .    in the deep double - well regime",
    "the lr - gp theory predicts only one excited state in the lowest band depicted in fig .",

    "similar 1h-1p excitations to higher quasi - degenerate excited orbitals form the mean - field description of the higher bands . by contrasting these mean - field predictions with the lr - mctdhb(@xmath43 ) results plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec1 ] by green and red lines we see that in the many - body description additional states contribute to the bands . in the many - body picture the zeroth band is composed of ten states , equal to the total number of particles : @xmath33 . to understand this ,",
    "let us once again return to the non - interacting case and recall that two lowest - in - energy eigenstates of the deep double - well trap are almost degenerate two - hump symmetric ( _ gerade _ ) and an anti - symmetric ( _ ungerade _ ) orbitals . in the non - interacting ground state",
    "all @xmath21 bosons occupy the gerade function .",
    "the first single - particle excitation to the other orbital is described by @xmath71 , changing , thereby , the overall symmetry .",
    "this @xmath64 excitation is the same as within the bdg theory .",
    "next excitation corresponds to the situation in which two particles are excited simultaneously from the ground state orbital to its anti - symmetric counterpart . as a consequence the overall gerade symmetry of this many - body excited state marked as",
    "@xmath72 is re - established .",
    "a three particle excitation process is described by @xmath73 and so on .",
    "this branch of many - body excitations thereby corresponds to the successive population of the respective anti - symmetric orbital .",
    "formally , all these excitations can be described by different redistributions ( configurations ) of the particles among the two orbitals .",
    "therefore , these excitations are ci - like .    in a presence of interactions",
    "the many - body states of the lowest ( 0th ) band become split . however",
    ", this branch of excitations is hard to access , due to the involvement of multi - particle processes .",
    "this physical conclusion is confirmed by the values of the corresponding linear response amplitudes , see tables  [ tab : es1 ] , [ tab : es2 ] and [ tab : es3 ] and their discussions .",
    "in contrast to the lowest band , bands of higher energy at the lr - mctdhb(2 ) level of description contain only four states .",
    "closer examination of the first band shows that two states are gp - like and the other two are pure many - body excitations . depending on the orbital in which the @xmath64 excitation is realized , the gp - like state is either of gerade or ungerade symmetry .",

    "more complex excitation structures like @xmath75 , @xmath76 are not reachable in higher bands .",
    "this absence of the higher - order excitations reflects the fact that the mctdhb(2 ) is an approximation to the exact solution and , therefore , higher - level theories are required for their proper descriptions , see e.g. , discussion of the lr - mctdhb(4 ) results .     * intermediate interaction : * excitation spectrum as a function of barrier height @xmath59 for @xmath33 bosons and @xmath77 .",

    "see text for the discussion . ]    for dynamic studies the clustering and degeneracy of states in bands complicates identification and attribution of the distinct excitations .",
    "one way to overcome this issue is to investigate becs in a shallow double - well ( @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec1 ] ) , where the bands are not yet formed .",
    "another possibility to split the excited states is to increase the interparticle interaction strength . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec2 ] we show the same study as before but for stronger interparticle interaction strength @xmath79 . for convenience , we keep the introduced labeling .",

    "the overall spectra are quite similar .",
    "the mean - field excitation energies are slightly shifted due to interparticle interaction .",
    "all these mean - field excitations are reproduced at the many - body level ( lr - mctdhb(@xmath63 ) - color lines ) in both cases .",
    "the main difference to the weak interaction , however , is a splitting of states in the zeroth band in the deep double - well regime . at intermediate interactions",
    "the ultracold systems become less coherent i.e. , more correlated and a single wave - function description is definitely insufficient .    by contrasting lr - mctdhb(@xmath63 ) and lr - mctdhb(@xmath80 )",
    "( black dots ) results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec2 ] we see that , as expected , at higher energies the four - orbital theory introduces additional many - body states and shifts positions of some excited states .",
    "the observed shifts suggest that an even higher - level mctdhb theory with more than @xmath78 orbitals is needed to converge the respective many - body states .",
    "however , for the excitation energies smaller than @xmath81 and not to small barriers ( @xmath82 ) the deviations between two- and four - orbital lr - mctdhb results are negligible .",
    "we conclude that the usage of the two - orbitals lr - mctdhb(@xmath63 ) theory is sufficient to describe the low - lying excitations for all the here studied systems and in all the studied regimes .",
    "we would like to mention that with stronger interaction strength _",
    "avoided crossings _ become visible .",

    "physically , the response amplitudes of all modes , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , and of all expansion coefficients , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , combine to give the many - body excitation spectrum @xmath165 . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath166 are the energies of the mctdhb ground state and excited states respectively .",
    "we have successfully managed to explicitly construct @xmath159 and obtained the many - body excitation spectrum for bosons interacting by contact  @xcite and general  @xcite interparticle interaction potentials .    to quantify the intensity of the response we compute the response weights : @xmath167 here all quantities with 0-superscript relate to the static mctdhb solution and @xmath168 define the driving amplitudes of the applied perturbations , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .    to identify the symmetry and nodal structure of the excited state we have computed and analyzed the real oscillatory parts of the corresponding response densities @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "the contributing orbital and ci - terms are given as following @xmath170 where @xmath171 , and @xmath172 .",
    "further , we defined @xmath173 .",
    "@xmath174    in our time dependent studies for the temporal evolution of the quantity @xmath175 given in time - slices @xmath176 we compute its discrete fourier transform ( dft ) which is the equivalent of the continuous fourier transform for a time - evolving signal given only at @xmath21 instants ( time - points ) separated by equidistant sample times @xmath177 ( i.e. a finite sequence of data ) : @xmath178 or , more precisely with @xmath179 @xmath180 we have normalized the obtained @xmath181 amplitudes such that their sum would be equal to the unity .    in all our numerical simulations with the mctdhb - laboratory package  @xcite we have use the sin - dvr , exp - dvr or fft - grid in a box @xmath182 with @xmath183 grid points .",

    "<S> complimentary , we propose two dynamic protocols that address excitations by propagating the mctdhb wave - function . in particular , we investigate dipole - like oscillations induced by shifting the origin of the confining potential and breathing - like excitations by quenching frequency of a parabolic part of the trap . to contrast static predictions and dynamic results we have computed time - evolutions and their fourier transforms of several local and non - local observables . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we study evolution of the @xmath0 , its variance @xmath1 , and of a local density computed at a selected position . </S>",
    "<S> we found out that the variance is the most sensitive and informative quantity - along with excitations it contains information about the de - excitations even in a linear regime of the induced dynamics . </S>",
