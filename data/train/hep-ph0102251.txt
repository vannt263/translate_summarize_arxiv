    "the pure leptonic decays of the heavy - light meson @xmath12 are very interesting . in principle",
    ", the pure - leptonic decay @xmath13(see , fig.1 ) can be used to determine the decay constant @xmath5 if the fundamental cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath4 of standard model ( sm ) is known .",
    "conversely if we know the value of decay constant @xmath5 from other method@xcite , these process also can be used to extract the matrix element @xmath4 .",
    "but there are the well known effect of helicity suppression and there are only one detected finial state , the measurement of pure leptonic decays of such pseudoscalar meson is very difficult .",
    "the pure leptonic weak decays of the pseudoscalar meson corresponding to fig.1 are helicity suppressed by factor of @xmath14 : @xmath15 of them only the process @xmath16 is special , it does not suffer so much from the helicity suppression , and its branching ratio may reach to @xmath17 .",
    "however the produced @xmath18 will decay promptly and one more neutrino is generated in the cascade decay at least , thus it makes the decay channel difficult to be observed .",
    "for the channels when the lepton is @xmath19 or @xmath20 and their neutrinos , besides the small branching ratios , there are only one detected finial state , the measurement of such channels are very difficult .",
    "fortunately , having an extra real photon emitted in the leptonic decays , the radiative pure leptonic decays can escape from the suppression@xcite , furthermore , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , with the extra photon to identify the decaying pseudoscalar meson @xmath12 in experiment from the backgrounds has advantages , since one more particle can be detected in the detector . although the radiative corrections are suppressed by an extra electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath21 , it will not be suppressed by the helicity suppression .",
    "therefore , the radiative decay may be comparable , even larger than the corresponding pure leptonic decays@xcite .",
    "so , the problem to increase the accuracy of the theoretical calculation , at least up to the first order radiative corrections , emerges .",
    "the radiative pure leptonic decays , theoretically , have infrared divergences and will be canceled with those from loop corrections of the pure leptonic decays . in all the existing calculation of radiative decays@xcite ,",
    "this part is ignored , since they do not include the radiative corrections of the pure leptonic decays . in this paper , we are interested in considering the radiative decays and the pure leptonic decays with one - loop radiative corrections together .",
    "since the process @xmath16 dose not suffer the helicity supression and has a large branching ratio , the corresponding loop correction(virtual photon ) to these process should has a considerable larger branching ratio , at least comparing with the radiative decay , and can not be ignored .    the paper is organized as follow : in section ii , we present the calculations of radiative pure leptonic contributions : _",
    "i ) _ besides the leptonic decays shown as fig.1 , the radiative decays into three family leptons with a real photon appearing in the final state as shown in fig.2 ; _ ii ) _ the virtual photon corrections to the pure leptonic decays , i.e. , a photon in loop as shown in figs.3.1 , 3.2 , 3.3 , 3.4 . in section iii",
    ", we evaluate the values of the decays . as uncertainties the dependence of the results on the parameters appearing in the considered model",
    "is discussed .",
    "finally , preliminary conclusion is obtained .",
    "let us start with the radiative decay .",
    "these contributions are corresponding to the four diagrams in fig.2 . according to the constituent quark model which is formulated by bethe - salpeter ( b .- s . )",
    "equation , the amplitude turns out to be the four terms @xmath22 : @xmath23\\times\\ ] ] @xmath24   { \\epsilon}^{\\lambda}\\times\\ ] ]    @xmath25    @xmath26{\\frac { i \\left(-g^{\\mu\\nu}+ \\frac{p^{\\mu}p^{\\nu}}{m_{w}^{2}}\\right)}{p^{2}-m_{w}^{2}}}\\ ] ]    @xmath27    @xmath28\\ ] ]    @xmath29    @xmath30\\ ] ]    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is bethe - salpeter wave function of the meson @xmath12 ; @xmath33 is the momentum of @xmath12 ; @xmath34 are the polarization vector and momentum of the emitted photon . in the quark model ,",
    "the momenta of @xmath35-quarks inside the bound state , i.e. , the @xmath12 meson , are : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the relative momentum of the two quarks inside the @xmath12 meson . as the @xmath12 meson is a nonrelativistic bound state in nature ,",
    "so the higher order relativistic corrections may be computed precisely , but being an approximation for a @xmath38-wave state , and focusing the light on the radiative decay corrections only at this moment now , we ignore @xmath37 dependence , i.e. , we may still have the non - relativistic spin structure for the wave function of the meson @xmath12 ( a @xmath39 state ) correspondingly : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the wave function at origin , and by definitions it connects to the decay constant @xmath5 : @xmath42 where m is the mass of @xmath12 meson .",
    "moreover we note that for convenience we take unitary gauge for weak bosons to do the calculations throughout the paper . with a straightforward computation",
    ", the amplitude can be simplified as : @xmath43 @xmath44(1-\\gamma_{5})\\nu_{\\ell},\\ ] ]    @xmath45    @xmath46   & + & \\left .",
    "is_{1}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\mu\\beta\\nu}p_{\\alpha } \\epsilon_{\\mu}k_{\\beta}\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]+ \\frac{(\\not\\ !",
    "{ p}-\\not\\ ! { k})}{m_{w}^{2}}p\\cdot{\\epsilon}(m^{2}-p\\cdot{k } )",
    "\\right\\}(1-\\gamma_{5})\\nu_{\\ell } , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the momentum of the charged lepton , and @xmath48 @xmath49    as a matter of fact , there is infrared infinity when performing phase space integral about the square of matrix element at the soft photon limit .",
    "it is known that the infrared infinity can be cancelled completely by that of the loop corrections to the corresponding pure leptonic decay @xmath50 .    in eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) , the infrared terms can be read out : @xmath51(1-\\gamma_{5})\\nu_{\\ell}.\\ ] ]    as the diagrams ( g ) , ( h ) , ( i ) , ( j ) in figs.3.3 , 3.4 always have a further suppression factor @xmath52 to compare with the other loop diagrams , and there is no infrared infinity in these four loop diagrams , we may ignore the contributions from these four diagrams safely . furthermore we should note that in our calculations throughout the paper , the dimensional regularization to regularize both infrared and ultraviolet divergences is adopted , while the on - mass - shell renormalization for the ultraviolet divergence is used .",
    "if feynman gauge for photon is taken ( we always do so in the paper ) , the amplitude corresponding to the diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) of fig.3.1 can be written as :    @xmath53}\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath54 ( -\\gamma_{\\nu})(1-\\gamma_{5})\\nu_{\\ell},\\ ] ]    @xmath55}\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath56 ( -\\gamma_{\\nu})(1-\\gamma_{5})\\nu_{\\ell},\\ ] ] where the @xmath57 , @xmath58 denote the momenta of the loop and the neutrino respectively .",
    "these two terms also have infrared infinity when integrating out the loop momentum @xmath57 .    after doing the on - mass - shell subtraction , the terms corresponding to vertex and self - energy diagrams ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e )",
    ", ( f ) can be written as : @xmath59 @xmath60@xmath61.\\ ] ] now let us see the cancellation of the infrared divergencies precisely .",
    "the infrared parts of the decay widths which are from the interference of the self - energy and vertex correction diagrams with the tree diagrams : @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 \\ ; ; \\ ] ] the infrared part of the decay widths from the interference of the `` box '' correction diagrams with the tree diagrams : @xmath65\\ ; ; \\ ] ] the infrared part of the decay width from the real photon emission : @xmath66 @xmath67 \\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath68 is a small energy , which corresponds to the experimental resolution of a soft photon so that the phase space of the emitting photon in fact is divided into a soft and a hard part by @xmath68 . where @xmath20 is the dimensional parameter appearing in the dimensional regularization .",
    "it is easy to check that when adding up all the parts : the real photon emission @xmath69 and the virtual photon corrections @xmath70 , the infrared divergences @xmath71 are canceled totally and the @xmath20 dependence is also cancelled .",
    "hence we may be sure that we finally obtain the pure leptonic widths for the @xmath12 meson decays to the three families of leptons which are accurate up - to the ` next'-order corrections and ` infrared finite ' but depend on the experimental resolution @xmath68 .",
    "first of all , let us show the ` whole ' leptonic decay widths , i.e. , the sum of the corresponding radiative decay widths and the corresponding pure leptonic decay widths with radiative corrections , and put them in table ( 1 ) . why we put the radiative decay and the pure leptonic decay with radiative corrections together here",
    "is to make the width not to depend on the experimental resolution for a soft photon .",
    "the values for the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73@xcite , @xmath74 gev , @xmath75 gev , @xmath76 gev and @xmath77 gev@xcite . +         considering the possible experimental resolutions , our prediction of the radiative decay widths @xmath78 and @xmath79 are close to the values in ref@xcite , but our prediction of @xmath80 is much smaller than the one in ref@xcite . in our model , if we using a smaller cut @xmath81 , the obtained @xmath82 will become larger , but since the decay widths depend on @xmath83 , the change of branching ratios will be not so much on the selecting of @xmath81 , we can see this in table ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , and for another example , if @xmath84 , the @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , but it is very difficult to obtain so small a @xmath81 in experiment .",
    "we can conclude that the best radiative decay channel is easy to search is @xmath88 .    for the convenience to compare with experiments , we present the photon spectrum of the radiative decays in fig.4 and fig.5 .",
    "in addition , we should note that the widths are quite sensitive to the decay constant @xmath5 , and are sensitive to the values of the quark masses @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
