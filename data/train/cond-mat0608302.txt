    "while being ferromagnetic in the bcc phase , fe in the fcc phase has been found to exhibit a spin - spiral structure when synthesized as precipitates in a cu matrix@xcite and calculations show that the magnetic structure is strongly dependent on the lattice parameter@xcite .",

    "we expand these results and present theoretical results concerning the magnetic ordering and interactions for fe , mn , and cr clusters deposited on a cu(111 ) surface .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the rs - lmto - asa method that is a first principles order - n method which has recently been extended to the treatment of non - collinear magnetism@xcite .",
    "the rs - lmto - asa method is based on the lmto - asa technique@xcite and the haydock recursion method@xcite .",
    "the lmto - asa formalism provides an efficient , parameter - free , basis set for treating close packed metallic systems and the recursion method gives the ability to treat problems where translational symmetry is absent and does also convey order - n scaling with respect to the number of nonequivalent atoms in the system . the recursion method does not directly solve the eigenvalue problem as formulated in the dft , but allows one to calculate the local density of states ( ldos ) for the orbitals of the atoms in the selected system .",
    "the rs - lmto - asa method has successfully been used for a wide range of problems including bulk systems , multilayers , embedded impurities and clusters and clusters on surfaces .",
    "earlier and more detailed descriptions of the collinear implementation of the rs - lmto - asa can be found elsewhere@xcite .    in the local spin density approximation ( lsda)@xcite , the electron density is expressed through a 2x2 density matrix @xmath0 which can be expressed in terms of the non - magnetic charge density @xmath1 and the magnetization density @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the 2x2 identity matrix and @xmath5 are the pauli matrices .",
    "self - consistent methods@xcite for calculating the electronic structure for non - collinear magnetization densities have existed for quite some time@xcite , and here we will focus on the specific details for treating non - collinear magnetization densities within the rs - lmto - asa .    with the recursion method ,",
    "the local density of states @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy , is obtained as @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the local green s function @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the hamiltonian .",
    "similar to the ldos , the collinear magnetic density of states @xmath12 can be calculated as @xmath13 . since the pauli spin matrix @xmath14 is diagonal in spin - space , the collinear magnetic density of states",
    "can be calculated using only diagonal elements of the green s function . if a generalized non - collinear magnetization density @xmath15 where @xmath5 is sought , evaluation of the off - diagonal parts of the green s function is in principle needed .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the green s function are possible to obtain by performing the recursion starting from carefully selected linear combinations of muffin - tin orbitals@xcite or perform a computationally more demanding block recursion calculation@xcite .",
    "however , in our implementation we avoid the evaluation of off - diagonal elements by applying successive unitary transformations @xmath16 on the hamiltonian , @xmath17 .",
    "when the hamiltonian is transformed in this way , the green s function transform similarly ; @xmath18 .    using the unitary property @xmath19 and the fact that cyclic permutations of matrix multiplications conserve the trace of the product ,",
    "the generalized magnetic density of states @xmath20 , can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the pauli matrices after the unitary transformation .",
    "the transformation matrix @xmath16 is different for the three directions , and chosen so that , @xmath23 , for @xmath24 , to yield a diagonal representation . in the trivial case of @xmath25 the unitary transformation",
    "is just the identity matrix . for the other directions",
    ", the unitary transformation corresponds to a spin rotation where @xmath16 can be calculated using spin-@xmath26 rotation matrices . decomposing the hamiltonian into a spin - dependent part , @xmath27 , and a spin - independent component , @xmath28 , yields that @xmath16 operates only on the spin - dependent part , @xmath29 from the transformed hamiltonians , @xmath30 , the ldos for the different directions",
    "can then be calculated using the regular recursion method and the magnetic density along the three directions can be obtained . from the three orthogonal directions ,",
    "the local magnetization axis is calculated and the ldos for the local spin axis can be constructed by taking the scalar product of the generalized magnetic density of states and the local magnetization vector . as all hamiltonians are constructed within an _ ab initio _ lmto - asa formalism , all calculations are fully self - consistent , and the spin densities are treated within the local spin density approximation@xcite . since the recursion procedure is performed for three orthogonal directions , the computational cost for each iteration is tripled compared with the collinear implementation of the rs - lmto - asa , but the linear scaling with respect to the number of nonequivalent atoms is retained .",
    "the calculations of the transition metal clusters have been performed by embedding the clusters as a perturbation on a self - consistently converged perfect cu(111 ) surface .",
    "the cu surface has been calculated using the experimental lattice parameter of cu .",
    "as is usually the case for lmto - asa methods , the vacuum outside the surface needs to be simulated by having a number of layers of empty spheres above the cu surface in order to provide a basis for the wave - function in the vacuum and to treat charge transfers correctly .",
    "after embedding the cluster on the surface , the charge and magnetization densities of the cluster atoms and the neighboring cu atoms and empty spheres are then recalculated until self - consistency is obtained while the electronic structure for atoms far from the cluster are kept unchanged to their unperturbed values .",
    "structural relaxations have not been included in this study , so the cluster sites have been placed on the regular fcc lattice above the cu surface .",
    "earlier studied on supported transition metal clusters@xcite have shown that structural relaxations can change the magnetic properties of the clusters .",
    "on the other hand , in an experimental situation , small clusters as those considered in this study are usually constructed in an out - of - equilibrium situation by manipulation with an stm tip and calculated equilibrium geometries might therefore not be relevant",
    ". the most relevant relaxation for these kind of artificially created clusters would be the distance between the cluster atoms and the substrate atoms and since a noble metal substrate is used in this study , the interaction between clusters and substrate play a lesser role compared to the interactions between the cluster atoms .",
    "the clean cu(111 ) surface has been modeled by a large ( @xmath315000 ) slab of atoms and the continued fraction , that occurs in the recursion method , have been terminated with the beer - pettifor@xcite terminator after 30 recursion levels .",
    "the non - collinear calculations have been performed without including the spin - orbit coupling . since this term",
    "is neglected , a preferred spin axis does not exist in the system and the magnetic structures are thus only converged with respect to the directions of the magnetic moments relative to the other spin moments in the cluster . in order to minimize the risk of finding magnetic orderings that correspond to only a local minimum , several starting guesses where used for each system .",
    "the calculated magnetic structures can be analyzed in terms of the exchange interactions @xmath32 between spins on atoms situated at sites @xmath33 and site @xmath34 .",
    "a well known connection between the exchange interactions and the magnetic ordering is given by the classical heisenberg hamiltonian , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the angle between the magnetic moment on site @xmath33 and site @xmath34 . note that in eqn .",
    "[ eqn4 ] , the magnitude of the spins have been incorporated into the effective @xmath32 interactions .    in this work ,",
    "we have calculated exchange interactions directly using the liechtenstein formula@xcite as implemented in the rs - lmto - asa@xcite for a large selection of the considered clusters .",
    "the @xmath32 s shown in this study , have been obtained from the ferromagnetic configuration of the clusters .",
    "other magnetic configurations typically result in different values of the @xmath32 s , although the signs are seldom changed.@xcite if the exchange interactions would be independent of @xmath36 , the magnetic structure could in principle be calculated by minimizing the heisenberg hamiltonian with @xmath32 s calculated from a ferromagnetic configuration .",
    "this is not the case for the systems considered in this work , which motivates a full non - collinear calculation of the magnetic structures .",
    "however , on a qualitative level the cause of the magnetic ordering , e.g. the effect of frustration or the competition between nearest and next - nearest interactions , can still be discussed in terms of the calculated exchange interactions .    for a selection of cr clusters , which are discussed in sec .",
    "[ crclusters ] , our calculated magnetic structures has been compared to the structure found by minimizing the heisenberg hamiltonian for a fixed configuration of @xmath32 s , where only nearest - neighbour interactions are finite .",
    "the minimization of the heisenberg hamiltonian for these clusters has been performed by a genetic search algorithm@xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ figfe1 ] the magnetic structure of several fe clusters are shown . regardless of the geometry of the studied fe clusters , we find the magnetic ordering in the clusters to always be ferromagnetic .",
    "the collinear magnetic structure for these clusters , which can be put in contrast with the non - collinear ordering found for fcc structured fe clusters embedded in bulk cu@xcite , could be caused by the fact that the decreased coordination of the surface clusters lead to a high - spin state which favours ferromagnetic coupling between neighbouring fe atoms@xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with an analysis by lizarraga _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out here that large magnetic moments do not automatically lead to collinear magnetism . as we will see in the section below",
    ", mn is an example where large moments result in an antiferromagnetic interatomic exchange coupling , which on a frustrated geometry lead to non - collinear magnetism . in the case of fe",

    "this would indicate that the magnetic moment per atom for a perfect monolayer of fe atoms on a cu(111 ) surface would be @xmath38  2.7 @xmath37 which is in good agreement with earlier calculations of fe monolayers on cu@xcite .",

    "the energy difference between the collinear structure and a non - collinear structure was found to be 18 mev / atom .",
    "the cause for the preferred collinear order is the different environment for the corner atoms who only have two nearest neighbours compared to the three central atoms who have four nearest neighbours each .",
    "the reduced coordination for the corner atoms causes their antiferromagnetic exchange coupling to nearest neighbours to be enhanced .",
    "the calculated j@xmath40s confirm this behaviour since the strength of the exchange interaction between a corner atom and a nearest - neighbour amounts to -27 mev while it is -12 mev between two central atoms .",
    "a similar mechanism can be expected for the nine - atom cluster displayed in fig .",
    "[ figmnt1:d ] , but for this geometry the atoms that are not situated at the corners of the triangle have three nearest neighbours due to the hole in the middle of the cluster .",
    "therefore the difference in the local geometry is smaller between the corner atoms and the central atoms which leads to a more delicate balance of the exchange couplings .",
    "the resulting structure has the moments pointing in three different directions instead of two directions which would be the case for a collinear antiferromagnetic solution .",

    "contrary to what was found for the six atom cluster in fig .",
    "[ figmnt1:c ] , it thus appears that the exchange coupling is larger between central atoms then between a corner atom and a central atom .",

    "it is peculiar that the mn cluster has the non - collinear tetragonal configuration as the ground state whereas the cr cluster has the collinear antiferromagnetic ground state solution . a possible explanation for the non - collinear ground state of the mn pyramid could be that , similar to the situation for several of the planar clusters , the reduced neighbour coordination for the top atom compared to the atom in the base of the pyramid yields different exchange interaction strengths between the atoms in the cluster .",
