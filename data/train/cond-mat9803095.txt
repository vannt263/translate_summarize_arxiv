    "one of the fundamental achievements of the renormalization - group ( rg ) theory of critical phenomena is the identification of universality classes in terms of the dimensionality @xmath6 of the system and the number @xmath7 of components of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "specifically , rg theory predicts that , within a given universality class , the critical exponents , certain amplitude ratios and scaling functions are universal quantities that do not depend , e.g. , on the strength of the interaction or on thermodynamic variables ( such as the pressure ) .",
    "the superfluid transition of @xmath4he belongs to the @xmath8 universality class and provides a unique opportunity for an experimental test of the universality prediction by means of measurements of the critical behavior at various pressures @xmath9 along the @xmath3-line @xmath10 ( and along the @xmath3-line of @xmath11he @xmath12 @xmath4he mixtures ) .",
    "early tests have been performed by ahlers and collaborators and consistency with the universality prediction was found within the experimental resolution @xcite . at a significantly higher level of accuracy",
    ", the superfluid density @xmath0 and the specific heat @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or , equivalently , thermal expansion coefficient @xmath13 ) above and below @xmath10 are planned to be measured in the superfluid universality experiment ( sue ) @xcite under microgravity conditions or at reduced gravity in the low - gravity simulator @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated recently @xcite , this would allow to perform measurements up to @xmath14 in the reduced temperature @xmath15 .",
    "+   + important steps towards an improved universality test can already be performed , even in the presence of gravity , by new ground - based measurements provided that non - universal and universal effects are properly separated in a nonlinear rg analysis of the data @xcite . to extract the leading critical exponents of @xmath0 and @xmath16 from the experimental data and to demonstrate their universality at a highly quantitative level requires detailed knowledge on certain universal amplitude ratios and on non - asymptotic corrections to the asymptotic power laws .",
    "these quantities can be calculated by means of field - theoretic rg methods applied to the @xmath17 model @xcite . +   + in the following we point to a serious lack of quantitative knowledge in the theoretical literature @xcite on these amplitude ratios and correction terms .",
    "we also discuss the implications of very recent two - loop results for @xmath0 @xcite and shall summarize the goals of a new theory project @xcite on higher - order rg calculations of the amplitude functions of @xmath0 and @xmath16 .",
    "in the previous analyses of experimental data for @xmath0 and @xmath18 ( or @xmath13 ) the following representations were employed @xcite    @xmath19     + @xmath20 + @xmath21 + where @xmath22 is the helium mass .",
    "these representations contain 10 nonuniversal amplitudes @xmath23 which need to be adjusted at each pressure .",
    "their values vary by @xmath24 , typically , along the @xmath3-line .",
    "the exponents @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the wegner exponent @xmath27 are predicted to be universal . the existing theoretical predictions on these exponents @xcite are based on field - theoretic calculations to five - loop order @xcite and borel resummation .",
    "the recent experimental result @xcite @xmath28 is consistent with but more accurate than the rg estimate @xcite .",
    "in addition , rg theory predicts the amplitude ratios + @xmath29 + to be universal @xcite . knowing their universal values for the @xmath30",
    ", @xmath31 universality class would impose significant constraints on the analysis of the experimental data and would thereby improve the reliability and precision of the experimental results regarding the universality of @xmath25 and @xmath32 .",
    "+   + the present theoretical knowledge of the ratios ( 4 ) , however , is based only on low - order ( mainly 1- and 2-loop ) field - theoretic calculations @xcite which imply an uncertainty at the level of at least @xmath33 . for example , even the sign of the ratio @xmath34 was incorrectly predicted by the two - loop @xmath35 expansion @xcite .",
    "this issue was resolved by a ( low - order ) calculation within the @xmath30 field theory @xcite .",
    "the present status of the experimental and theoretical values of the universal ratios ( 4 ) is summarized in table 1 ( without error estimates ) .",
    "universal amplitude ratios for the @xmath36 universality class    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as noted in ref .",
    "13 , there is a large uncertainty of the theoretical value for @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath30 field - theoretical values for @xmath38 and @xmath39 are based on one - loop results @xcite .",
    "very recent @xmath30 two - loop results @xcite , to be discussed in the subsequent section , imply considerably different values @xcite , thus indicating a considerable lack of reliability of low - order results for the amplitude ratios ( 4 ) .",
    "in an effort to improve the theoretical prediction on these amplitude ratios , a two - loop calculation of @xmath0 was recently carried out by burnett , strsser and dohm within the @xmath17 field theory in @xmath30 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the superfluid density can be calculated via josephson s definition @xcite +   + @xmath40 + where @xmath41 is the transverse susceptibility at finite wave number @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the order parameter ( bose condensate wave function ) . within the @xmath30 @xmath17 field theory the representation ( 5 )",
    "becomes @xcite @xmath44 + where + @xmath45 + is an appropriately defined correlation length .",
    "the amplitude functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend on the effective renormalized @xmath17 coupling @xmath48 ) which for @xmath49 approaches the fixed point value @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "these functions are plotted in fig . 1 in zero- , one- , and two - loop order .",

    "the curves terminate at the fixed point @xmath59 .",
    "> from ref .",
    "while the two - loop correction to @xmath60 is remarkably small ( about 1% ) at the fixed point @xmath59 , the two - loop contribution to @xmath46 is about 10 % , thus indicating a considerable uncertainty of low - order perturbation theory .",
    "the uncertainty is even larger for the derivative of @xmath46 at @xmath61 which implies a correspondingly large uncertainty of @xmath55 in ( 1 ) and of the ensuing amplitude ratio @xmath62 . a similar uncertainty exists with regard to the amplitude function @xmath63 of the specific heat @xmath2 below @xmath64 @xcite determining @xmath65 and @xmath66 in ( 3 ) as well as with regard to the amplitude function @xmath67 of the helicity modulus @xmath68 @xcite which is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "in order to significantly reduce the uncertainty of the theoretical predictions on the amplitude ratios ( 4 ) it has been proposed @xcite to perform new higher - order field - theoretic rg calculations and borel resummations of various amplitude functions . in general , the results of such calculations depend on the specific renormalization scheme employed . in view of various applications ,",
    "the method of the minimally renormalized @xmath17 field theory at fixed dimension @xmath30 @xcite appears to be most appropriate .",

    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are known only in two - loop order @xcite . for a three - loop calculation within a different renormalization scheme",
    "see @xcite .",

    "( even for @xmath71 the five - loop result needs to be revised on the basis of higher - order calculations for @xmath70 according to item ( i ) above . )",
    "the amplitude function @xmath73 of the specific heat above @xmath64 .",
    "previously this function has been computed in borel - resummed form for @xmath74 on the basis of six - loop results @xcite . but this calculation needs to be revised on the basis of higher - order calculations for @xmath70 according to item ( i ) above .",
    "the amplitude function @xmath75 of an appropriately defined correlation length @xmath76 below @xmath64 .",
    "this correlation length performs the task of absorbing logarithms in the four - point coupling @xmath77 in the bare perturbation series in @xmath30 dimensions @xcite . for @xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath76 can be taken to be the ordinary correlation length of three - dimensional ising - like systems below @xmath78 .",

    "this function is known in two - loop order @xcite .",
    "equivalently ( and preferably ) , the amplitude function @xmath80 of the helicity modulus @xmath68 @xcite should be calculated in higher order .",
    "higher - order calculations of @xmath67 or @xmath47 would be more demanding than those of @xmath81 and @xmath82 because they involve perturbation theory at finite wave number @xmath42 . in view of the smallness of the two - loop correction to @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) it has been argued @xcite that this low - order result for @xmath47 can be considered as rather reliable , presumably within a few percent . in a first step of future calculations it will therefore be sufficient to confine the project to the quantities ( i ) - ( v ) noted above . +   + once the functions @xmath83 and @xmath75 are known at an accuracy of a few percent it will be possible to determine the amplitude ratios @xmath84 at the same level of accuracy . it will be advantageous to go beyond the asymptotic representations ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) and , instead , include the entire wegner series , i.e. higher - order terms @xmath85 , @xmath86 , _ without introducing new nonuniversal parameters into the analysis_. for the strategy of such a _ nonlinear rg analysis _ see refs . 6 and 17 .",
    "this may imply that the phenomenological analytic corrections @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the representations ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) are unnecessary or will turn out to be much smaller than determined previously @xcite .",
    "+   + the success of this theory project depends on the order of perturbation theory up to which the calculations can be carried out .",
    "preliminary considerations by larin @xcite indicate that the amplitude functions @xmath89 and @xmath90(u ) can be determined up to four - loop order , and the rg functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , on the basis of previous work @xcite , up to five - loop order .",
    "such results will have an important impact on a future test of the fundamental rg prediction of critical - point universality .",

    "for @xmath93 the result is @xmath94 .",
