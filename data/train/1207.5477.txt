    "negative - parity levels can be obtained for these nuclei exciting one neutron from the @xmath1 shell to the @xmath52 shell .",

    "the angular momentum and parity of the lowest energy states with both parities can be given a simple qualitative interpretation , associated with the last uncoupled neutron . in @xmath46 , @xmath53 , it occupies the @xmath18 orbital . for @xmath54 = 21 and 23",
