    "the search for a self - sustaining magnetohydrodyamic dynamo has taken on great momentum in recent years , as researchers have sought to produce dynamos in the laboratory @xcite and in simulations @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental problems in numerical magnetohydrodynamics is the formulation of boundary conditions .",
    "the governing equations describe the velocity and magnetic field in in a finite container of electrically conducting fluid . at the container boundaries ,",
    "the velocity is specified , but the magnetic field is not . instead , the magnetic field is required to satisfy continuity conditions with the exterior magnetic field in the domain surrounding the fluid .",
    "the nature of these conditions depends on the properties of the surrounding medium ; a complete discussion can be found in @xcite .    under the quasi - static approximation @xcite , for a given velocity field @xmath0 and magnetic reynolds number @xmath1 ,",
    "the equations describing the interior magnetic field are    [ eq : bint ] @xmath2    the case of a fluid of finite electric conductivity restricted to a finite volume and surrounded by vacuum is of special importance because it models a number of experimental , geophysical , and astrophysical configurations . since there are no electrical currents in a vacuum , @xmath3 is curl - free , and is therefore the gradient of a potential if the exterior domain is simply connected .",
    "the exterior magnetic field then obeys :    @xmath4    [ eq : bext ]    but is otherwise not fixed .",
    "the magnetic field is required to be continuous at the boundary : @xmath5 in this case , continuity of all three components of the magnetic field are sufficient to uniquely determine both the interior and exterior fields .",
    "our ultimate goal is to transform - into boundary conditions that can be applied to without calculating @xmath6 .",
    "the general principle we will employ is to construct a complete basis of exterior solutions @xmath6 of in a preprocessing step , and to calculate @xmath7 for each member of the basis .",
    "the matching conditions will then yield boundary conditions for @xmath8 .    to explore this approach",
    ", we will apply it to the simpler analogous scalar problem of the poisson problem in an interior domain .",
    "we will require the solution to match continuously to an exterior solution satisfying laplace s equation . in this case , both dirichlet and neumann matching conditions are necessary to specify a unique solution .",
    "formally , we wish to solve the following problem :    [ eq : two_domains ] @xmath9    with boundary conditions :    [ eq : match ] @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a bounded domain with boundary @xmath12 . a physical interpretation of - is that of an electrostatic potential @xmath13 of a field generated by charges distributed in space with the density @xmath14 , where the electrical permeability of the vacuum is taken to be one by the choice of units .",

    ". we will briefly survey a small portion of this literature here , and postpone a more detailed comparison between our method and others to a later section .",
    "the main tool by which exterior domains can be eliminated is green s theorem , which replaces elliptic differential equations over a domain with integrals over the bounding surfaces .",
    "the use of methods based on boundary integrals has grown explosively since the 1970s-1980s to solve engineering problems from fields such as acoustics , elasticity , electromagnetism and fluid mechanics @xcite .",
    "hybrid methods , coupling a differential equation formulation in a domain and a boundary integral formulation at the boundary via an influence matrix , were also developed at the same time to solve  and similar problems .",
    "the majority of these approaches have been based on finite elements and are hence applicable to complicated real - world geometries .",
    "the boundary integrals are discretized with techniques derived from finite element theory , leading to the term boundary element method , and the hybrid methods use finite elements to solve the equations in the domain .",
    "this situation contrasts with magnetohydrodynamics , which has been dominated by spectral methods .",
    "spherical domains are standard , for geophysical and astrophysical reasons .",
    "spectral methods can then be based on spherical harmonics and the poloidal - toroidal decomposition @xcite .",
    "the solution to laplace s equation on the exterior is immediate and , moreover , solutions and associated boundary conditions for each spherical harmonic and toroidal or poloidal component are decoupled .",
    "boundary conditions at the interface can then be formulated for each mode without the use of an influence matrix .",
    "the technique which we will describe is based on spectral methods , but the geometry is assumed to be somewhat more complicated .",

    "we formulate a two - stage method for solving  , consisting of an initial preprocessing step which depends only on the geometry , followed by a step whereby solutions for many different distributions @xmath16 can be generated at little incremental cost .",
    "this is the usual description of the decomposition of @xmath13 into homogeneous and particular solutions , with the additional proviso that solutions in the exterior domain are to be taken into account in the preparation of the homogeneous solutions .",
    "we will construct the homogeneous solutions by generating harmonic bases @xmath17 and @xmath18 of interior and exterior solutions , corresponding to dirichlet boundary data @xmath19 to be specified later .",

    "it is known that replacement of the helmholtz equation by a boundary integral equation can lead to singularities for certain values of the wavenumber ( here @xmath164 ) ; a large body of work , e.g.  @xcite , addresses this problem .",
    "however , in the magnetohydrodynamic case of a conducting fluid surrounded by an exterior vacuum , no such difficulties would be introduced , since the exterior problem remains governed by laplace s equation .",
    "more complicated vectorial operators may appear , as occur in the navier - stokes or magnetohydrodynamic equations .",
    "we mention here some other techniques that have been used to solve exterior problems or to match interior and exterior domains .",
    "spectral methods can be combined with various transformations and mappings .",
    "the inner region can be surrounded by a sphere , and the outer domain decomposed into the region inside and outside the sphere .",
    "the exterior domain can be mapped into an interior domain via a @xmath165 mapping @xcite ; spectral methods can then be used to treat either or both domains . the region exterior to one or more spheres has been mapped to the interior of a rectangle @xcite or a pentangular @xcite region rotated about an axis , and chebyshev - fourier expansions used to solve elliptic equations arising in the study of black holes in general relativity",
    ". a smooth boundary can be parameterized by angle , and the boundary values represented as a series of trigonometric functions or spherical harmonics @xcite .",
    "our method differs from these in that a chebyshev approximation is used to represent the boundary values on each segment of a non - smooth boundary , and an analytic formula is used to calculate the surface density which exactly yields this chebyshev approximation .",
    "conformal mapping is another technique which can be used to calculate interior or exterior harmonic functions .",
    "the riemann mapping theorem guarantees the existence of a conformal transformation from the interior or exterior of a simply connected domain into the interior or exterior of a unit disk ; its proof is , however , non - constructive , and does not explicitly derive the transformation .",
    "for some geometries , including the exterior of a rectangle , an analytical formula can be derived @xcite . for polygon - bounded regions with piecewise - constant boundary conditions ,",
    "the schwarz - christoffel @xcite mapping has proved to be a very robust tool , applied to problems arising in magneto- and electro- statics , potential flows , inverse problems and many other fields .",
    "our influence matrix approach relies on calculating harmonic functions with arbitrary boundary data , for which conformal mapping is much more problematic .",
    "more general conformal mappings are often computed by solving symm s or carleman s equation numerically on the domain boundary , making this approach similar in terms of numerical cost and precision to boundary integral equation methods .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for domains including corners , the chebyshev approximation is especially well suited , guaranteeing superconvergence of the mapping function @xcite .",
    "as a test case for the magnetohydrodynamic equations , we have developed a method for solving the two - dimensional poisson equation in a bounded domain , where the solution satisfies matching conditions with a harmonic potential outside the domain .",
    "the method solves only the interior problem and determines the boundary conditions ensuring smooth matching with the exterior solution .",
    "the essential element of this approach is construction of a basis of harmonic functions which represent the near - boundary exterior solutions uniformly .",
    "this basis is used to construct the influence matrix which serves to impose the coupled boundary conditions between the interior and exterior solutions .",
    "the method is numerically reasonably well conditioned and can be used for quite high spatial resolutions . for a spectral solver ,",
    "this method guarantees exponential convergence .    instead of corresponding to point sources on the boundary , each exterior harmonic solution corresponds to a spectral basis function .",
    "the most costly process  the construction of a basis of exterior harmonic functions  depends only on geometry and spatial resolution .",
    "once the basis is computed it can be stored and used for any computation using the same resolution and domain shape . when used as a preprocessing step for time - dependent simulations ,",
    "the cost of constructing the exterior harmonic basis is negligible compared to that of thousands of time steps .",
    "since cylindrical coordinates have one periodic direction , it should be possible to apply this method separately to each of the fourier modes , treated individually as two - dimensional problems .",
    "the extension of this method to the mhd equations in a finite cylindrical geometry is currently under investigation ."
