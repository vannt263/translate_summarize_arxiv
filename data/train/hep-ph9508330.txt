    "the main motivation for the models of cp violation has been to explain the @xmath0 parameter for neutral kaon decay simultaneously preserving the vanishing smallness of the electric dipole moment of the neutron . the idea that cp violation can be accomodated in extensions of the higgs sector",
    "was put forward by weinberg @xcite in his three higgs doublet model , and t.d .",
    "lee @xcite in his two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with spontaneous cp violation . in these models",
    "the yukawa couplings have to be constrained to suppress flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "a natural condition is to require that either @xmath1 couples to the up quarks and @xmath2 to the down quarks or @xmath1 couples to all the quarks and @xmath2 does not couple at all . a discrete symmetry @xmath3 is imposed on the higgs potential to ensure suppression .",
    "in majority opinion the minimal standard model suffers from inadequate cp violation coming from the ckm matrix to be considered a viable model for baryogenesis at the electroweak scale .",
    "so the 2hdm with with cp violation in the higgs sector has attracted attention for the past several years in the context of electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "mclerran - shaposhnikov - turok and voloshin @xcite had shown that in this model , the triangle diagram with one gauge boson leg and two scalar legs and top quark in the loop contributes a correction to the effective action @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an operator that can be found out by explicit evaluation of the diagram and @xmath6 is the chern - simons ( cs ) number .",
    "this correction biases the cs number and since @xmath7 , nett baryon number results , with the sign determined by the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "recently yue - liang - wu @xcite has generalised the model of glashow and weinberg @xcite and has proposed that the value of @xmath0 and the limits on edm can be well explained with less stringent conditions on the yukawa couplings .",
    "the higgs boson - fermion couplings are now much more general and no discrete symmetries are imposed on the higgs potential . in this class of models",
    "fermions acquire mass from both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . consequently in addition to",
    "the triangle diagrams with @xmath1 on the external legs , diagrams with @xmath2 also on the external legs start contributing to the effective action .",
    "the mstv proposal has been criticised on the grounds that it is a higher order adiabatic effect , of the order @xmath9 . in their considerations",
    "the relative phase between the two higgs vacuum expectation values was treated constant throughout bubble evolution . here",
    "we provide the details of the argument @xcite that the inclusion of the dynamics of the relative phase removes the adiabatic suppression , making it an effect of the order @xmath10 .",
    "we have also previously shown @xcite that the uncertainties of physical parameters of bubble formation @xcite can be circumvented if we consider a string induced phase transition @xcite .",
    "this is the scenario we shall be considering here as well .",
    "it may be noted that since according to @xcite , the string induced bubbles provide adiabatic conditions , all b - genesis mechanisms relying on such conditions are workable .",
    "in particular the mechanisms of cohen and kaplan @xcite and cohen - kaplan - nelson @xcite can also proceed through string induced bubbles .",
    "we recapitulate here the corresponding bubble profile ansatz including the time evolution of the relative phase and calculate the resultant contribution to the effective action .",
    "putting together the two sources of enhancement , viz .",
    ", dynamics of the relative phase and additional triangle diagrams , we show that the mechanism has sufficient potential to give adequate baryogenesis .",
    "it was first pointed out by turok and zadrony @xcite and then explicitly calculated by mclerran - shaposhnikov - turok and voloshin @xcite , that for 2hdm a term biasing the chern - simons number with a cp odd chemical potential is contributed by the triangle diagram of figure 1 .",
    "this contribution to the effctive action at finite temperature is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of the top quark , @xmath13 is the riemann zeta function , and @xmath14 are the pauli matrices . for homogeneous but time varying configurations of the higgs fields and in the @xmath15 gauge , @xmath16 n_{cs}\\\\      & = & { \\cal o}_{1 } n_{cs }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , here the top quark acquires mass only from @xmath1 as demanded by the glashow - weinberg natural flavor conservation ( nfc ) criteria . in wu s model , the fc criterion is satisfied under relaxed conditions on the higgs - fermions couplings . in this case",
    "the general yukawa interactions can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and@xmath20 are @xmath21 doublet quarks , leptons and higgs bosons , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are @xmath21 singlets .",
    "@xmath25 is a generation label and @xmath26 is a higgs doublet label .",
    "@xmath27 @xmath28 are the yukawa coupling matrices . according to wu",
    "the glashow - weinberg criteria can be replaced by a theorem which states that the flavor conservation for the neutral currents is natural in the higgs sector or equivalently , the matrices @xmath27 @xmath28 are diagonalizable simultaneously by a biunitary or biorthogonal transformation , if and only if the square @xmath29 @xmath27 are represented in terms of the linear combinations of a complete set of @xmath29 matrices @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 where , @xmath32 satisfy the following orthogonal condition @xmath33 , + @xmath34 , with the normalization @xmath35 .",
    "this generalised yukawa coupling prompts us to consider another set of triangle diagrams as shown in fig-2 .",
    "the contribution at finite temperature from these diagrams to the effective action can similarly be calculated to be @xmath36 n_{cs}\\ ] ] @xmath37 n_{cs}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the yukawa coupling when the fermions couple to @xmath39 .      now to find the bubble profile we use the following ansatze for the finite temperature vacuum expectation value of the higgs fields @xmath40 where , as pointed out by cohen - kaplan - nelson @xcite we can fix the unitary gauge ensuring @xmath41 is the physical pseudo - scalar orthogonal to the goldstone boson eaten by z. this gauge fixing gives the relation between @xmath42 and @xmath41 to be , @xmath43 we assume that the phase transition takes place when a combination of @xmath44 and @xmath45 becomes massless in a particular direction @xmath46 in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "hence , in the bubble profile we may take @xmath48 with this parametrization and finite temperature corrections , the effective potential for the @xmath49 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is @xmath50 where , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are temperature corrected mass parameters and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are combinations of quartic coupling constants with small temperature dependent corrections .",
    "the constant @xmath55 is the ratio of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the standard parameterisation of the 2hdm @xcite , and @xmath58 is the phase of the neutral component of zero temperature vacuum expectation value of @xmath2 .",
    "rescaling @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 omitting the primes the potential can be written as , @xmath62    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the geometry of string induced bubbles is cylindrical . with this in mind",
    ", the time dependence of @xmath49 and @xmath41 can be found by solving the following equations , @xmath65 @xmath66 the time independent solution of @xmath49 can be found by imposing the boundary condition @xmath67 as @xmath68 and @xmath69 as @xmath70 . subsequently , as the nontrivial minimum becomes favorable , the same solutions begin to evolve in time .",
    "the parameters used in the equations are ,    the time evolution of the bubble profile @xmath71 has been reported earlier @xcite . in fig-3",
    ", we show the time evolution of the relative phase in the regions where @xmath49 has become nonzero .",
    "if the initial reference value is zero , it oscillates to reach the stationary value dictated by the 2hdm effective potential at the relevant temperature .",
    "we assume this value to be @xmath72 since no natural reasons prevent it from being so .",
    "now we can use these solutions to evaluate the average value of the operators as , @xmath73 and , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these parameters have to be determined from the phenomenology of the 2hdm which is yet far from being tested by current experiments . knowing the solutions to eqn.s ( 14)-(15 )",
    ", we can estimate the integral in eqn .",
    "( 16 ) to be @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the nett change in the relative phase @xmath41 at any given point as the bubble wall sweeps past it , and @xmath79 .",
    "there is an additional contribution from the transient part of @xmath41 , which can also be calculated numerically , but is not significant . as for the term @xmath80 , its cp odd part has the magnitude @xmath81 from arguments already given .",
    "putting in other known factors , we see that @xmath82 and a similar contribution from @xmath80 .",
    "recall that @xmath83 is the dimensionless cubic self - coupling induced by thermal loops , and @xmath84 involves the quartic self - couplings of the 2hdm . for naturalness we would like @xmath78 to be @xmath72 but",
    "the remaining factor is numerically a small magnitude , perhaps between @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "note however that the effect is not suppressed by the physics of the process viz . ,",
    "the bubble wall dynamics .",
    "we emphasise again that this is the consequence of the dynamics of the relative phase of the 2hdm .",
    "to estimate the baryon asymmetry we assume the presence of high temperature sphaleron processes inside the bubble wall .",
    "the rate of such transitions per unit time per unit volume is of the order @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the number of fermions created per unit time in the bubble wall is given by @xmath89 where we have made use of a well established master formula @xcite @xcite , and where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the thickness and the surface area of the bubble wall respectively .",
    "from which we get the baryon to photon ratio to be @xmath92 where we have used @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this answer easily accomodates the observed value of this number .",
    "it is worth emphasising the physics of this answer which is fairly robust against changes in the specific particle physics models .",
    "the thermal rate contributes @xmath97 through @xmath98 , and another @xmath99 is contributed by @xmath100 .",
    "the remaining smallness of the answer follows from smallness of the thermal vacuum value @xmath101 @xmath102 , which is small on the scale set by @xmath103 .",
    "the appearance of this particular physical quantity has to do with our picture of the process occuring in bubble walls as the phase transition is yet in progress .",
    "the mstv proposal has been criticised @xcite on the grounds that the operator @xmath104 is of the order of @xmath105 . since @xmath106 ,",
    "i.e. , the temperature dependent vacuum value @xmath107 is @xmath108 , the effect was thought to be unacceptably small . but with time variation of the relative phase allowed , we find the relevent operator is of the order of @xmath109 .",
    "the effect is therefore not intrinsically suppressed .",
    "we also note that the same analysis could be fruitfully applied to the proposals of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "secondly , we have shown that in principle there are more diagrams in the 2hdm contributing to the effective action .",
    "although in making numerical estimates we are hampered by large number of unknown parameters in the 2hdm , it is worth remembering the existence of these effects as potential sources of enhancement in electroweak baryogenesis .",
