    "_ chandra _ has now detected a large number of x - ray features related to the jets and hotspots of extragalactic radio sources ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the jet detections have attracted a great deal of interest , but much of the fundamental physics behind them remains unclear .",
    "the x - ray jets commonly seen in fri sources @xcite probe the high - energy particle acceleration in these objects @xcite , while the few frii jets that have been detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be evidence for extremely high bulk speeds on kiloparsec scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but the details of the processes responsible for producing the x - rays in both classes of source are still debatable , and the issue is confused by uncertainties about the doppler boosting factors of the x - ray and radio - emitting material .    in hotspots",
    "the situation is more clear - cut .",
    "these structures , which are believed to trace a strong terminal shock or shocks at the end of the jet in powerful frii sources , are generally thought to be unlikely to be moving with respect to the observer at highly relativistic speeds @xcite , although moderately relativistic motions in and beyond the hotspot ( with @xmath0 ) may be required to explain some observations @xcite .",
    "their radio - to - optical spectra are often well constrained , giving limits on the amount of synchrotron emission expected in the x - ray , and their sizes and structures are often well known .",
    "this means that it is possible to make a simple prediction of the x - ray flux densities expected from inverse - compton emission .",
    "the dominant emission process for bright , compact hotspots which show strong spectral steepening or a synchrotron cutoff at high radio / optical frequencies is likely to be synchrotron - self - compton emission ( ssc ) , in which the radio photons from the synchrotron process are inverse - compton scattered into the x - ray band by the synchrotron - emitting electrons .",
    "a prediction of the ssc flux density can be made if the magnetic field strength in the hotspot , and therefore the electron number density , can be estimated .",
    "conversely , a measured x - ray flux density which is inferred to be ssc can be used to estimate the magnetic field strength in the hotspot .    lllll ssc near&cygnus a&nlrg&_rosat_&1 + equipartition&&&_chandra_&2 + & 3c295&nlrg&_chandra_&3 + & 3c123&nlrg&_chandra_&4 + & 3c196&q&_hst_&5 + & 3c207&q&_chandra_&6 + & 3c263&q&_chandra_&this paper + & 3c330&nlrg&_chandra_&this paper + unclear&3c351&q&_chandra_&7 , this paper + non - ssce&pictor a&blrg&_einstein_&8 + & & & _",

    "this result is often taken as evidence for equipartition between magnetic fields and synchrotron - emitting electrons in radio sources in general .",
    "rosat _ observations , however ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , showed that some hotspots had x - ray emission too bright to be produced by the ssc mechanism with equipartition field strengths , suggesting that a different emission process was responsible .",
    "at the time of writing , after a number of new _",
    "hotspot detections , this dichotomy remains , as shown in table [ hotspots ] .",
    "three interesting facts about this division are immediately apparent .",
    "firstly , the number of objects whose emission processes are not from ssc near equipartition ( hereafter ` non - ssce ' objects ) is still a significant fraction of the total .",
    "secondly , the non - ssce objects all display broad emission lines , which may , after all , indicate some role for beaming in the hotspots . and , thirdly , the non - ssce objects all have optical synchrotron hotspots .",
    "the major remaining questions in this area are therefore :    1 .",
    "[ q1 ] are magnetic field strengths close to equipartition typical in hotspots ? 2 .   what emission process is responsible for non - ssc sources , and is it related to their other common properties , or to relativistic beaming ?",
    "question [ q1 ] can only be addressed by new observations of hotspots , and in the first part of this paper we report on our deep _",
    "observations of three sources selected on the basis of bright compact radio hotspot emission , describing the emission from their hotspots , lobes , nuclei and cluster environments . in  7 we will return to the second question .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in  [ obs ] we discuss the selection of the sample and the observations we have used . in ",

    "extended emission , on scales larger than the radio lobes , was visible by eye in the observations of 3c263 and 3c330 . to characterize this extended emission we masked out the readout streak and the non - nuclear emission ( hotspots and lobes ) , using conservatively large masking regions which effectively covered the whole extended radio source in each case , and then generated a radial profile for each object .",

    "our data are derived from the ciao mkpsf command , energy - weighted to reflect the approximate energy distribution of the observed data in the extraction radius , smoothed with a small gaussian to simulate the effects of pixelation and aspect uncertainties , and then fitted with a suitable function of radius .",
    "the forms used by @xcite , though a good fit to the inner regions of the psf and so adequate for the purposes used in their papers , do not represent the wings found at radial distances of tens of arcsec , and these are important in the case of 3c263 and 3c351 , where the emission is dominated by the bright central point source out to large radii .",
    "accordingly , we fit a functional form consisting of two gaussians , two exponentials and a power - law component , which we found empirically to be a good fit out to large distances , to the psf @xmath171 :    @xmath172    where @xmath173 , @xmath174 are parameters of the fit and @xmath175 is a fixed normalizing value . in practice , the power - law index @xmath176 was determined using the lowest - resolution psf libraries , and then fixed while the other parameters were determined from higher - resolution data . in using a power - law model for the psf wings , we have followed other work on characterizing the large - radius psf ( see , e.g. , documents at url : @xmath177http://asc.harvard.edu / cal / hrma / hrma / psf/@xmath178 ) and we have obtained similar power - law indices , @xmath179 , in all the fits we have carried out .      to compare the observed x - ray emission from the lobes and hotspots to the predictions of inverse - compton models",
    "it is necessary to know the spatial and spectral structure of these components in the radio and optical in as much detail as possible .",
    "the available data in these bands are discussed in the following sections , but in each case we extracted and tabulated radio flux densities ( table [ radiofluxes ] ) and derived radio - based models for the hotspots and lobes . where these components were well resolved , we measured their sizes directly from radio maps ; where they were compact , as was the case for some of the hotspots , we characterized the component size by fitting a model of the emission from an optically thin homogeneous sphere , convolved with the restoring gaussian , to the high - resolution radio maps .",
    "we then used a computer code to predict inverse - compton flux density as a function of magnetic field strength .",
    "two inverse - compton codes were available to us .",
    "one , described by @xcite , treats all inverse - compton sources as homogeneous spheres ; this allows us to neglect the anisotropy of inverse - compton emission , and so gives a quick and simple calculation .",
    "our other code is based on the results of @xcite . by incorporating brunetti s formulation of anisotropic inverse - compton scattering ,",
    "this code allows us to take account of the spatial and spectral structure of the resolved hotspots . to model spatial structure ,",
    "the hotspots are placed on a fine three - dimensional grid and the emissivity resulting from the illumination of every cell by every other cell is calculated ( making small corrections for self - illumination and nearest - neighbour effects ) . to do this in full generality",
    "is computationally expensive , since it requires numerical integration of equations a15 of @xcite over the electron distribution and incoming photon distribution for each cell in an @xmath180 algorithm , where @xmath181 is the number of cells in one dimension of the three - dimensional grid .",
    "we solve this problem by allowing only a small number of distinct electron spectra and magnetic fields in our grid .",
    "this means that the task of calculating the illumination of a region of electrons of a given spectral shape by a given photon distribution reduces to one of tabulating the integral of brunetti s results for a suitably sampled subset of the possible values of the geometry parameter @xmath182 .",
    "since the dependence on the _ normalization _ of the electron energy spectrum and on the incoming photon flux is linear , the @xmath180 part of the algorithm then just involves an interpolation and multiplication .",
    "for homogeneous spheres , or in the case of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) inverse - compton scattering ( cmb / ic ) where anisotropy is not an issue , the results of our two codes agree to within a few per cent , and so in the results presented below we use whichever code is most appropriate for a particular situation .",

    "we choose this model because synchrotron theory tells us that it is a good approximation to the expected situation in hotspots , where particle acceleration and synchrotron losses are competing ; for @xmath187 it approximates the standard ` continuous injection ' model , which applies to a region containing the acceleration site and a downstream region of synchrotron radiation loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". theoretical prejudice ( based on models of shock acceleration ) also suggests a value @xmath188 for the low - energy power - law index ( the ` injection index ' ) .",
    "this electron energy spectrum gives rise to a synchrotron spectrum whose spectral index @xmath5 is flat or inverted ( @xmath189 ) around and below some frequency @xmath190 , has a value 0.5 up to around some break frequency @xmath191 and then steepens to a value of 1.0 before an exponential cutoff around some frequency @xmath192 .",
    "such models have been successfully fit to a number of well - studied hotspots ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is well known that the synchrotron turnover , break and cutoff are not sharp ; for typical parameters of a radio source they occupy a decade or more in frequency .",
    "it is for this reason that we prefer to work with the well - defined and physically interesting quantities @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195",
    ", whose only disadvantage is that they must be specified together with a value of the magnetic field strength @xmath196 .",
    "we typically work with the equipartition magnetic field strength , @xmath197 , which is given by @xmath198 ( where we have assumed that equipartition is between the radiating electrons and the magnetic field only , and where si units are used , with @xmath199 being the permeability of free space ) .",
    "@xmath195 is constrained if there is evidence for spectral steepening to @xmath200 in the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "we find that @xmath194 is often in the observed radio region , so that it is relatively easy to constrain .",

    "the evidence for an offset relies on the accuracy of the wmosaic task in the stsdas package in iraf , used to produce the mosaiced image shown in these figures .",
    "however , the size of the offset ( @xmath325 ) seems too large to be accounted for by uncertainties in the wfpc2 chip geometry ; other sources which span chip boundaries in this field ( notably some faint galaxies near the quasar nucleus ) do so without showing any evidence for such offsets .",

    "the compact hotspot of 3c351 ( j ) is not well resolved at any radio frequency available to us , and is compact even in the _ hst _ images .",
    "the size derived from fitting a homogeneous sphere model depends on the frequency and resolution of the data used , suggesting that there may be unresolved spatial or spectral structure .",
    "the value we adopt ( @xmath212 ) is based on fitting a homogeneous sphere model to the 8.4-ghz data of g02 .",
    "this is larger than the value used by @xcite , who just took half the fwhm of the gaussian fit of b94 .",
    "spectrally , the hotspot seems to have a steeper spectrum between 1.4 and 8 ghz than between 8 and 15 ghz , but this may be due to contamination from more extended emission in the low - resolution 1.4-ghz map ; the maps of b94 and g02 both show structure around this hotspot .",
    "the high - frequency ( 15 - 85 ghz ) spectral index of the hotspot is close to 1.0 .",
    "if we assume that some of the 1.4-ghz flux density is not from the compact region , then the 8.4 , 15 and 85-ghz and optical data points can be fit , though not particularly well , with a version of our standard spectral model , in which the synchrotron spectral index steepens from 0.5 to 1.0 in the radio , and then retains this value out to beyond the b - band . since the optical to x - ray spectral index is close to 1.0 , the 1-kev x - ray data point alone can then be fit as an extension of the synchrotron spectrum , with @xmath328 at equipartition ( this conclusion differs from that of @xcite , who find a somewhat lower maximum contribution from synchrotron emission , because of the steeper injection index they use )",
    ". however , the flat x - ray spectrum of the hotspot ( @xmath329 ) is inconsistent with a synchrotron model . like @xcite , we prefer a synchrotron model in which the break is at higher frequencies and the synchrotron emission is cutting off in the optical ( @xmath330 , @xmath331 at equipartition ) .",
    "this improves the fit to the radio and optical data .",
    "however , in this model , plotted in fig.[351-sed ] , the predicted inverse - compton flux density at equipartition ( @xmath197 = 21 nt ) is 55 pjy , almost two orders of magnitude below the observed value .",

    "the radio and optical data can then be fit with a spectral model very similar to that used for hotspot j ; the 1.4-ghz data point again lies above the extrapolation of the spectrum inferred from the high - frequency radio data , but neglecting this , we find very similar break and cutoff values , @xmath337 , @xmath338 , at equipartition ( @xmath339 nt ) .",

    "the predicted 1-kev x - ray spectral index in this model is also 0.6 , which is somewhat flatter than the observed value of @xmath341 .",
    "the inverse - compton model can not explain the observed offsets between the x - ray and radio centroids of hotspot l. to explain this offset while retaining a simple model of the electron distribution we would need an external illuminating source , but no such source is apparent ; in particular , hotspot j is much too far away to produce a significant effect ( the predicted flux density from ic scattering of j s photons by l is only 2 pjy at equipartition , or 2% of the predicted ssc flux density )",
    ". otherwise , if the x - rays are to be ssc emission , there must be significant electron spectral structure in the hotspot which we have failed to take into account in our model . with only one high - resolution , high - frequency radio map ,",
    "it is impossible to test this suggestion , but the possible offset seen between the radio and _ optical _ positions may support it .    unlike @xcite ,",
    "because of the lower r - band optical flux density we obtain , we find 3c351 l to have a relatively flat optical spectral index , @xmath342 ( similar to the x - ray spectral index ) , and this means that a synchrotron model connecting the optical and x - ray emission can not be ruled out in this hotspot either , and is an alternative explanation for the bright x - ray emission , though it would require a second , flat - spectrum synchrotron component to be present .",
    "the differences we find between the equipartition / minimum energy and ssc fields in these two hotspots are larger than the factor @xmath343 inferred by @xcite because of differences in our assumptions .",
    "as noted above , we use larger angular sizes for the hotspots , and this accounts for a substantial part of the difference .",
    "@xcite used a different definition of the minimum energy , obtaining a lower field strength than our calculation would have given on the same assumptions about hotspot size .",
    "they also used a version of the more complex electron energy spectrum described by @xcite .",
    "this illustrates a general point : differences in model parameters can have an important effect on the derived magnetic field strength .",
    "the weak s radio hotspot of 3c351 is not detected in the x - ray .",
    "based on the background count rate around the hotspot region , we can set an upper limit on its x - ray flux density ( table [ restab ] ) .",

    "that used for hotspot j , we find that the two components of a taken together would have an ssc flux density of approximately 0.2 pjy , a factor 250 below our upper limit .",
    "thus , even if these hotspots were brighter than their equipartition flux density by the same factor as hotspot j , we would not have detected them in our observations .",

    "* ) , suggests that 3c351 s environment is poor , so this is not a surprising conclusion .",
    "the gas in groups of galaxies of this sort of luminosity can have a pressure at 100-kpc radii comparable to that estimated above for the lobes of 3c351 , so it remains possible that 3c351 s lobes are pressure - confined by a faint x - ray emitting environment .",

    "of the three sources , one ( 3c330 ) has hotspots whose x - ray emission is consistent with ssc emission at equipartition , one ( 3c263 ) has an inferred hotspot magnetic field strength a factor 2 below the equipartition value ( consistent with other sources , such as 3c295 , which show a similar deviation from equipartition ) and one ( 3c351 ) has hotspots whose x - ray emission , if it were of ssc origin , would imply a magnetic field strength an order of magnitude below the equipartition value .",
    "what process is responsible for the anomalously bright , flat - spectrum hotspots in 3c351 ?",
    "we can consider several classes of explanation .",

    "as discussed above , this model does not explain the offsets between the radio and x - ray peaks in hotspot l. * _ ssc with standard electron spectral model , @xmath358 , and spatial variation of the electron population_. this model can explain the offsets between the peaks in various wavebands , at the cost of introducing new features in the electron population for which there is no independent observational evidence .",
    "* _ ssc with second electron population , @xmath359_. if we introduce an additional population of low - energy electrons whose synchrotron emission is below the observed radio band , , we can greatly increase the ssc flux .",
    "if we also allow this population to be offset with respect to the radio - emitting population , we can explain the properties of hotspot l. this model has the same disadvantages as 1b .",
    "* _ ssc with relativistic beaming , @xmath360_. beaming would mean that our estimate of the hotspot flux density would not correspond to the source - frame value . the predicted ssc flux density and the ratio @xmath361 depend on the doppler factor @xmath362 ( @xmath363^{-1}$ ] for a hotspot , where @xmath168 is the angle to the line of sight and @xmath364 is the bulk lorentz factor ) .",
    "beaming causes the observed flux densities to change by a factor @xmath365 . for a pure power - law spectrum with electron energy index @xmath366 ( @xmath367 ) , neglecting aberration effects , the predicted ssc flux can be shown to go as @xmath368 , and so , for values of @xmath366 in the range 23 , doppler boosting , ( @xmath369 ) reduces the predicted equipartition flux while doppler dimming ( @xmath370 ) increases it . to place 3c351 at equipartition",
    "we would require @xmath371 ( @xmath372 ) with the source lying close to the plane of the sky .",
    "this is clearly not a plausible model for a quasar ; in addition , the rest - frame radio luminosity of the hotspot becomes very large .",
    "* _ boosted cmb , @xmath360_. relativistic fluid speeds in or close to the hotspot would give rise to an increased contribution from inverse - compton scattering of the microwave background , which is negligible in all our sources if relativistic effects are not present . the effective energy density in microwave background photons",
    "increases as @xmath373 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this is partly offset by the reduction in the electron number density .",
    "there are additional corrections because of the anisotropic nature of the inverse - compton process ; the net result is that a source exhibiting emission from this process must be close to the line of sight .",
    "because of the blueshifting of the cmb photons in the source frame , the results are also strongly dependent on the presence of low - energy electrons ; in order to obtain a spectrum which is not flat or inverted , we require , approximately , @xmath374 . to reproduce the observed emission from 3c351 with an equipartition @xmath196-field and the lowest possible bulk @xmath255 , @xmath375 , we require @xmath376 and @xmath377 . larger angles to the line of sight require larger @xmath255 values .",
    "this model thus requires 3c351 to be very close to the line of sight ( for @xmath378 , @xmath379 , so the linear size of the source would have to be @xmath380 mpc , if bending is neglected ) .",
    "we also require highly relativistic flows to power both j and l : either the jet splits , or ( more conventionally ) a relativistic outflow from j powers l. in the second case , we would expect @xmath255 to be different in the two hotspots .",
    "the angles between the line of sight and the velocity vectors of the flows powering the hotspots are likely to differ in either situation , because the hotspots and the core do not lie on a straight line : so in this model the parameters must ` conspire ' to ensure that the x - ray to radio ratios remain similar in the two hotspots .",

    "_ boosted cmb , but hotspots are ` jet knots ' , @xmath381_. in this model , the objects we have described as hotspots are not terminal hotspots at all , but knots in a projected jet ( which presumably terminates somewhere else ( e.g. , in the displaced n lobe ) in a hotspot of brightness comparable to that in the s lobe .",
    "this model has the advantage that we do not ( necessarily ) expect jet deceleration between knots , and that it allows us to retain sub - relativistic speeds in the hotspots .",
    "otherwise it has the same disadvantages as 2a . *",
    "_ boosted hotspot back - scattering , @xmath196 unknown_. we can not rule out the possibility that the x - ray emission does not originate in the hotspot ( post - shock ) region at all",
    ". it could instead be due to scattering of hotspot photons by the incoming , presumably highly relativistic jet .",
    "this model has the advantage that it can explain the offsets observed in hotspot l. it has the disadvantage that , as no radio jets are observed entering the hotspot , we can not use the observations to constrain magnetic fields or jet speeds .",
    "because the ic emission from this process is even more anisotropic than for 2a and 2b , the problem of the angle made by the jet to the line of sight becomes greater in this model .",
    "* _ synchrotron from second electron population , @xmath196 unknown_. a second , flat - spectrum synchrotron component in the x - ray ( and possibly also the optical ) can explain many of the observations of 3c351 s hotspots , including the offsets seen in hotspot l if the second electron population is spatially offset from the low - energy electrons responsible for the radio emission .",
    "given the very different loss timescales in the radio and x - ray , and the rapidly changing nature of hotspots ( and the bulk flows that feed them ) that numerical simulations suggest , there is no very strong reason to believe that a single electron energy power law _ should _",

    "all these models are _ ad hoc _ in one way or another .",
    "the beaming models do help to explain the large - scale asymmetry of the radio source as well as the x - ray emission , but they all require 3c351 to be very close to the line of sight and extremely large in unprojected linear size , as well as invoking speeds in the hotspot regions that are very much higher than have been inferred from other work .",
    "the other models require less extreme parameters for the radio source , but do not answer the question of why 3c351 is unlike the other sources in the sample , which show no evidence for strong departures from equipartition , extra electron populations , or new emission mechanisms .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results on 3c351 with those on other frii sources with ` bright ' x - ray hotspots , such as pictor a and 3c390.3 . in the case of pictor",
    "a , @xcite found that a magnetic field a factor 14 below the equipartition value would reproduce the flux density of the x - ray hotspot , but they reject a simple ssc model of the type we have used in this paper because of the well - constrained steep spectrum of the hotspot ( @xmath382 ) .",
    "a simple synchrotron model is also rejected because the optical data require a cutoff in the optical @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite do not rule out a model in which there are contributions from both x - ray synchrotron and ssc emission , as in model 3b above , which requires @xmath383 .",
    "this factor is similar to those that we would require in 3c351 on the pure ssc model ( 1a ) .",
    "they also consider the possibility of a second electron population ( models 1c and 3a above ) .    in the case of 3c390.3 , @xcite rejected a ssc model for the _ rosat_-detected x - ray hotspot , hotspot b , because the x - ray emission was much brighter than their ssc prediction .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "observation of this source ( wagner et al .",
    ", in preparation ) detects all three compact hotspots in 3c390.3 and allows a more precise determination of some of the source parameters .",
    "examining the archive data , we find that the brightest hotspot , hotspot b , has a 1-kev flux density of @xmath384 njy , in good agreement with the result of @xcite , and @xmath385 . the radio , optical and x - ray data in hotspot b can be connected with a simple synchrotron model .",
    "an ssc model requires a large departure from equipartition ; with our cosmology and standard spectral assumptions we find @xmath386 , much higher than in any other source we have examined .",
    "moreover , the predicted ssc spectral index is @xmath387 , while the spectral index in the synchrotron model is @xmath388 , so that the _ chandra _ spectrum favors the synchrotron model .",
    "we see no reason to believe that there is a significant contribution from ssc emission in hotspot b of 3c390.3 .",
    "spectra of the two other x - ray detected hotspots in 3c390.3 are even steeper than in hotspot b , which suggests that a synchrotron model is required there as well .",
    "it seems likely that the differences between the radio to x - ray spectra of the three hotspots , remarked on by @xcite , can be explained in terms of similar electron spectra with different high - energy cutoffs .",
    "given the large number of jets in low - power radio galaxies now thought to be due to synchrotron radiation (  1 ) , the existence of the required high - energy electrons in hotspots is no longer as remarkable as it once seemed .",
    "this observational evidence for synchrotron emission in hotspots is indirect support for one of the synchrotron models ( 3a / b above ) to explain the emission from 3c351 .",
    "the _ chandra _ data on hotspots in general are therefore reinforcing the conclusion , already suggested by _",
    "observations , that more than one emission mechanism is operating in the x - ray in frii hotspots .",
    "some hotspots , of which 3c390.3 is to date the most convincing example , require an x - ray synchrotron model .",
    "some , such as cygnus a , 3c123 , 3c263 and 3c330 , are likely to be pure ssc , with no significant contribution to the x - rays from synchrotron emission and a hotspot magnetic field close to the equipartition value . and some , such as pictor a and perhaps 3c351 ( model 3b above ) , may have synchrotron and ssc emission at similar levels , or may be different from the other sources in some more interesting way . in order to distinguish between these cases , good radio and optical information and ,",
    "ideally , an x - ray spectrum of the hotspot are required : further high - resolution observations in the radio , optical and uv may be required to to disentangle the emission mechanisms in pictor a and 3c351 .    in this picture ,",
    "the questions remaining to be answered are :    * what is special about the hotspots that exhibit x - ray synchrotron emission ?",
    "it s particularly striking that all three compact hotspots of 3c390.3 are x - ray synchrotron emitters , despite being quite different in their local environments and radio structures ( see * ? ? ?",
    "there is no obvious way in which these hotspots , in quite different parts of the source , can ` know ' that they should accelerate electrons to high energies  unless some intrinsic property of the beam is involved .",
    "* what is special about the hotspots , like 3c351 and possibly pictor a , that may have @xmath389 ?",
    "@xcite suggested a partial answer to the second of these questions .",
    "they pointed out that , in standard shock - acceleration models , the high - energy cutoff of the synchrotron electron population is higher for lower hotspot magnetic fields , because it is determined by the balance between acceleration and synchrotron loss processes . in other words , we might expect to see an enhanced contribution from ssc emission in radio sources which we know by other means to have a synchrotron spectrum extending to high energies .",
    "this might apply to 3c351 and pictor a , which are known to have optical synchrotron hotspots , while sources like cygnus a and 3c123 , whose electron spectra are known to cut off at lower energies , have fields closer to equipartition .",
    "however , one source in the current sample , 3c263 , breaks the trend by having an optical synchrotron hotspot without being particularly x - ray bright . and",
    "this picture does not explain _ why _ it is that some sources have particularly low hotspot b - fields , or why , in the case of 3c351 , _ both _",
    "hotspots appear to do so .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) lead us to expect that hotspots will be transient structures , and may well have different magnetic field and electron acceleration behaviour at different times .",
    "all hotspots may pass through phases of inverse - compton domination and synchrotron domination of their x - ray output .",
    "if this is the case , neglecting the probably important question of observational bias , then the statistics of detected sources are telling us that sources spend approximately equal times in the two regimes .",
    "however , this does not explain ( and is even to some extent incompatible with ) the observation of correlated properties in spatially separated hotspots , as observed in cygnus a , 3c351 and 3c390.3 .",
    "both lobes of all three sources are detected in the x - ray . in all three cases ,",
    "the measured x - ray emission is close to the predicted value for inverse - compton scattering of cmb photons , requiring field strengths which are factors between 1.4 and 2.5 below equipartition values on simple models which treat the lobes as uniform ( table [ lobehot ] ) .",
    "we have not taken into account any possible illumination of the lobes by the quasar nuclei ( nuclear inverse - compton , nic ) , which would give an additional photon contribution and reduce the discrepancy between the inferred and equipartition magnetic field strengths .",
    "we do not believe that nuclear illumination is likely to dominate the cmb photon field in our sources , since in 3c263 and 3c351 there is no evidence for a higher ratio of x - ray to radio flux in the lobes on the counterjet side , as would be expected , due to the anisotropy of the inverse - compton process , in a nic model @xcite .",
    "is the lobe emission inverse - compton in origin at all ?",
    "the similarity of the observed fluxes to the predicted values , and the tight relationship between the emitting regions in radio and x - ray , suggest this , but can not confirm it .",
    "the x - ray spectra are not good enough in any of our sources to allow us to rule out a thermal origin for the lobe emission , although the existence of some hard counts ( e.g. , in 3c263 s n lobe and 3c351 ) would imply quite high temperatures , @xmath390 kev ) .",
    "if the x - rays were thermal , their spatial similarity to the radio emission means that they would have to originate either inside the lobes , or in a boundary layer around the lobes with a thickness considerably less than the lobe dimensions ( i.e. , no more than a few kpc , given the spatial resolution of _ chandra _ ) .",
    "polarization observations are conventionally taken to rule out the presence of large amounts of thermal material inside radio lobes , although , as pointed out by @xcite , large amounts of thermal material can be hidden by suitable magnetic field configurations .",
    "unfortunately , estimates of the depolarization measure @xmath391 are not available to us for either of our quasars . for 3c330 ,",
    "@xcite quotes values of @xmath391 ( the ratio of polarization at two frequencies , in this case 1.4 and 5 ghz ) of 0.84 and 0.55 for the two lobes .",
    "( a lower @xmath391 means more depolarization . ) we can convert the observed _ chandra _ count rate for the lobes of 3c330 into a thermal proton density using xspec and assuming that the thermal plasma uniformly fills the radio lobes ; we use a mekal model with @xmath392 kev , @xmath393 solar abundance and galactic absorption .",
    "we find that a thermal proton density of @xmath394 m@xmath267 would be required .",
    "using equipartition fields , this would give rise to a large faraday depth , and , using the results of @xcite , we would expect @xmath395 , which is much less than the observed value ; we would also expect a very low degree of polarization at low frequencies , whereas we know that the source remains polarized at 1.4 ghz .",
    "we can not reduce the faraday depth by significantly decreasing the assumed magnetic field strength , as the x - ray observations set a lower limit on the field strength , @xmath396 .",
    "so , for simple field geometries , the idea that thermal protons are inside the lobes is not consistent with the radio data .",
    "if the thermal protons are instead in a boundary layer of shocked gas around the source , their density can be estimated in the same way , and is greater than the value calculated above by the square root of the ratio of the boundary layer to source volumes : for example , if the boundary layer were @xmath325 ( 3.5 kpc ) thick in 3c330 , the density would be higher by a factor @xmath288 . here",
    "faraday - rotation constraints are less helpful , because we do not know the value of the external magnetic field strength . however , if the external thermal material is assumed to be shocked ambient gas , well - known results for the density contrast in a shock imply that the ambient gas density must be no more than a factor 4 less dense than the inferred external density , or at least a few @xmath397 m@xmath267 .",
    "this is comparable to , though on average somewhat larger than , the density of the external material inferred from the observations described in  [ 330ext ] at the distance of the lobes of 3c330 , so this model remains possible from that perspective .",
    "however , it seems likely that this external gas is too hot ( particularly in 3c263 ) to give rise to the observed x - ray emission when shocked , unless the shocks are only weak ( in which case the stand - off distance needs to be large ) .",
    "there is also no obvious gradient of x - ray emissivity along the sources , particularly 3c330 , although the @xmath164-model fits of  [ 330ext ] imply that the external density drops by an order of magnitude along the length of the lobes in that source . and there is no evidence in the x - ray data of the limb - brightening expected in such a model , although the small number of counts from the lobes makes detailed analysis of the lobe structure difficult .",
    "we conclude that , although models in which the lobe - related x - ray emission are due to an external boundary layer are not ruled out , they are more contrived than the alternative of an inverse - compton origin with a magnetic field somewhat lower than the equipartition value .    whether or not the emission is inverse - compton in origin , its detection places some interesting constraints on the filling factors in the lobes , by giving an upper limit on lobe x - ray emissivity . as pointed out by @xcite , the dependence of inverse - compton emissivity on filling factor is complicated , depending on the nature of the ` fluid ' that fills the gaps between radio - emitting regions . however ,",
    "if the fluid is relativistic electrons , i.e. , the lobes consist of a more or less uniform distribution of electrons with a very wide range in magnetic field strengths , then the inverse - compton emissivity increases as the filling factor @xmath398 decreases . in the simple case in which the magnetic field is either on or off , and where on is in energy equipartition with the synchrotron - emitting electrons , the ic emissivity over the entire lobe goes up approximately as @xmath399",
    "this sort of model is constrained by the observations to have @xmath400 .",
    "the constraint is difficult to evade if we require that there are no strong pressure differences in the lobes .",
    "filling factors lower than this are only possible if the non - radiating ` fluid ' does not consist of electrons  for example , if the magnetic field dominates the overall energy of the lobes .",
    "we note that less extreme models with inhomogenous magnetic field distributions are not ruled out by the data .",
    "for example , the models used by @xcite give only a modest increase ( @xmath249% ) in the expected inverse - compton emissivity if the mean field energy is in equipartition with the electrons .",
    "a cmb inverse - compton model , and the inferred relatively small but non - zero departures from equipartition , are consistent with early observations of less powerful sources with _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as with new results now emerging from _ chandra _ observations of sources more similar to our targets @xcite .",
    "the extended emission around 3c263 and 3c330 seems very likely to be thermal emission from a cluster - scale atmosphere : we have thus confirmed earlier predictions @xcite that 3c263 should lie in an x - ray emitting cluster .",
    "if the lobe x - rays are indeed inverse - compton emission , the model we favor of those discussed in  [ lobesect ] above , then the required departures from equipartition produce lobe pressures which are consistent , within the uncertainties on the various calculations , with the inferred external pressures .",
    "small departures from equipartition may therefore solve the problem , discussed by @xcite , of the apparent under - pressuring of the radio lobes with respect to the external medium ; this is particularly true if some of the x - ray emission detected by @xcite with _ rosat _ was in fact inverse - compton emission from the lobes of their target sources .",
    "more observations are required to test this hypothesis .",
    "we note , however , that our observations provide little or no support for the idea that lobes are strongly overpressured with respect to the external medium . for this to be the case , there would need to be another contribution to the internal lobe pressure , for example from relativistic protons , which can not be detected with the present observations .",
    "we have detected x - ray emission from the hotspots and lobes of three powerful frii radio sources , and low - level extended emission from the hot - gas environments of two of them .",
    "the hotspots in two of the objects we have studied , 3c330 and 3c263 , are consistent with being ssc emission with a hotspot magnetic field within a factor 2 below the value for energy equipartition with the synchrotron - emitting electrons .",
    "we argue therefore that magnetic field strengths close to equipartition are common in hotspots .",
    "the double hotspots in the third source , 3c351 , are difficult to accommodate within an ssc model ; they require magnetic field strengths much further from equipartition and , at least in one hotspot , there are offsets between the radio and x - ray centroids that a simple ssc model does not explain .",
    "the flat x - ray spectral indices rule out the possibility that the x - rays can be synchrotron emission from the electron population responsible for the radio emission .",
    "we are left with several alternative models , none of them particularly attractive : the most plausible condenders are an ssc model with large departures from equipartition , together with unmodeled spatial structure in the electron population in the secondary hotspot , a synchrotron model with a second , high - energy electron population , or strong beaming effects in the hotspot regions . in any case , it is striking that the two hotspots behave in such a similar way , in spite of their large spatial separation ( and the expectation that primary and secondary hotspots should have different physics ) .",
    "as we have pointed out , other x - ray hotspot sources , like cygnus a and 3c390.3 , seem to share this tendency for the hotspots to appear to know about each other .",
    "the lobe emission we have detected seems most likely to be due to inverse - compton scattering of microwave background photons by the synchrotron - emitting electron population .",
    "all three sources can be explained by such a model , in which the magnetic field strengths in the lobes are at most a factor 2 below equipartition ( on a simple model with uniform field and electron distributions in the lobes ) .",
    "if this model is correct , the pressures in lobes are a factor of a few above the canonical minimum pressures .",
    "this factor may be enough to account for the discrepancy between the minimum pressure and the pressure in the external hot gas environment , discussed by @xcite , and indeed we suggest that the two sources with detected extended x - ray emission , 3c263 and 3c330 , are in approximate pressure balance with the hot gas in their cluster / group environments ; such a model is also possible for 3c351 .        the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
