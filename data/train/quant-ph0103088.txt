    "in the 1970 s , braginsky , thorme , unruh , caves and others introduced firstly the concept of quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement in which a measurement strategy is chosen that evades the undesirable effect of back action@xcite .",
    "this was to respond the problem caused by heisenberg s uncertainty relations .",
    "using the fact that the quantum formalism describes physical quantities as non - commuting operators ( that is , as mathematical objects @xmath0 @xmath1 such that @xmath2 ) , the heisenberg inequalities state that the product of the dispersions of ( the ` uncertainty ' in ) @xmath3 and @xmath1 has a lower bound : @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , for non - commuting operators , a very precise measurement of @xmath3 , resulting in a very small dispersion @xmath5will be associated with a large value of @xmath6 .",
    "this measurement back action has far - reaching consequences from a practical point of view , since it may prevent the retrieval of the initial result in a series of repeated measurements@xcite . with the development of the technical quality of optical sources and detectors , and techniques of nonlinear optics , the emerging field of quantum optics seemed to be particularly well suited for implementing qnd measurements .",
    "the basic requirement of qnd measurement is the availability of the qnd variable which may be measured repeatedly giving predictable results for a system .",
    "if a variable @xmath7 ( in the interaction picture ) satisfying @xmath8 @xmath9=0 $ ] , then the system in an eigenstate of @xmath10 will remain in this eigenstate for all subsequent times although the eigenvalues may change .",
    "such observable is called qnd variable . furthermore",
    ", this qnd variable must commute with the interaction hamiltonian coupling the detector and the meter or @xmath11 $ ] @xmath12 .",
    "the soul of the quantum non - demolition measurement is to measure qnd variable in their eigenstates : if the system is already in eigenstate then repeated measurements will cause no demolition to it and give predictable result ; if the system is not in the eigenstate , then after the measurement it is set to eigenstate and keep in this eigenstate in the following repeated measurements .    but",
    "until now , all qnd observables considered are local . and",
    "it is well known that nonlocality and its most celebrated manifestation form  entanglement is so important and fancy that it becomes one of the footstones of the quantum mechanics .",
    "myriads of attention has been attracted since it was first noted by einstein - podolsky - rose ( epr ) and schrdinger . and",
    "the experimental prove of this nonlocality confirms the validity of quantum mechanics .",
    "its famous embodiment , the epr states @xmath13 @xmath14 , proposed by bohm , was shown by bell , which have stronger correlation than that allowed by any local hidden variable theory .",
    "furthermore this kind of correlation of the quantum mechanics can not be generated by local operations and classical communications ( lqcc ) . here",
    "local operations include unitary transformations , additions of ancilla , measurements and throwing away parts of the system , all performed locally by one party on his subsystem .",
    "classical communication between parties is included because it allows for the creation of mixed states that are classically correlated but exhibit no quantum correlations . for multi - partite system ,",
    "there is also entanglement , such as generalized ghz states @xmath15@xcite , where @xmath16 , which are much more complicated and less well understood even today .",
    "recently it has been realized that quantum resources can be useful in information processing where quantum entanglement plays a key role in many such application as quantum teleportation@xcite , superdense coding@xcite , entanglement enhanced classical communication@xcite , quantum error correction@xcite , quantum key distribution@xcite , quantum computational speedups@xcite , quantum distributed computation@xcite , and entanglement enhanced communication complexity@xcite . among these applications ,",
    "the common difficulty is to measurement these orthogonal entangled bases such as @xmath17-particle ghz states .",
    "so it may be very expedient if we can measure these entanglement states without demolition it .    in this article",
    "we generalize the qnd variables to the nonlocal ones by proposing a novel qnd measurement network of bell states and multi - partite ghz states . in section",
    "ii , the logic network of bell operator qnd measurement is presented . in section iii , the general logic network for the generalized ghz states is shown . and",
    "in the last section , one of its potential applications in quantum authentication ( qa ) system of the quantum security automatic teller machine ( qsatm ) is proposed .",
    "we firstly introduce some basic definitions and notations .",
    "the universal two - bit controlled - not gate @xmath18 maps boolean values @xmath19to @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 let @xmath23 denotes hadamard gate @xmath24 , which transforms state @xmath25 into @xmath26 . it can be realized by an optical half - wave plate(hwp ) with its fast axis oriented at @xmath27 relative to the horizontal direction in quantum optics .",
    "the @xmath17-partite generalized ghz bases in the hilbert space @xmath28could be written as @xmath29 pairs of orthogonal states @xmath30 .",
    "define the phase qubit represents the sign information between the pairs . and define part - parity bit represents the parity of the border upon parties .",
    "for example , if the two parties are @xmath31 parity qubits for @xmath17-partite ghz bases such as part - parity of partite 1 and 2 , of partite 2 and 3 , and so on .",
    "in addition , we define global - parity qubit if both terms in a state contain even or odd number of @xmath32 . not all states has global - parity qubit information .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote 2 possible outcomes of 2 possible measurements on the first qubits and similarly @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the second qubit .",
    "and associates the first measurement the pauli matrix @xmath37 with normalized 3-dim vectors @xmath38 and similarly for the other measurements",
    ". then bell operator @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 , and similarly the @xmath17-particle bell operators @xmath44 @xmath45 whose eigenstates are bell states and generalized ghz states.@xcite obviously these nonlocal operators @xmath46 are constant and can be taken as the qnd variables .",
    "if we can measure bell states and generalized ghz states without any destruction , then the interaction hamiltonian@xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 then @xmath49 $ ] @xmath12 , and any states can be measured predictably in the subsequent measurements .",
    "now consider the qnd measurement of the bell states , the logic network is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the ancillary qubits : ancilla 3 and ancilla 4 are initially set in state @xmath50 .",
    "the measurement process for the four bell bases : @xmath51 @xmath52 can be divided into four steps .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\(1 ) the two particles 1 and 2 in bell state to be measured come into two paths with controlled - not gate @xmath53 and @xmath54 separately .",
    "then particle 1 and 2 act as control bit in turn to manipulate the ancilla 3 : _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @xmath55    @xmath56 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    seen from the equations above , states @xmath57 and @xmath58 set ancilla 3 to state @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively and keep themselves unchanged .",
    "we see that the information of the parity bit is extracted out by the ancilla 3 bit .",
    "\\(2 ) particle 1 and 2 are transformed by a pair of hadamard gates @xmath61 and @xmath62 locally : @xmath63    we can see the transformation is just a unitary transformation among the four bases .",
    "but it is very important for the information of the phase qubit is translated into the parity qubit by this transformation .",
    "\\(3 ) as in step 1 , the ancilla 4 pick out the parity qubit information translated from the phase qubit in step 2 by the controlled not gates .",
    "then the four bell bases are discriminated ( see table 1 ) .",
    "@xmath64 @xmath65    \\(4 ) just as in step 2 , after another pair of hadamard gates , the final output state recovers to the initial bell state .",
    "so this measurement is a quantum non - demolition process .",
    "when a state @xmath66where @xmath67 , is inputted into the logic network shown in fig.1 , the measurement process is just the same @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 can be known as the measurement probability of each bell states .",
    "this means that this phase operator incommutes with the bell operator .",
    "for a @xmath17-partite generalized ghz base in the hilbert space @xmath28 , there are @xmath72 part - parity qubits information which are between the border - upon partite , and one phase qubit information . then @xmath17 ancillary qubits are needed .",
    "the key to this scheme is that controlled - not gates could extract parity qubit information and this qubit phase information could be translated into the holistic - parity information under hadamard gates : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a subset of @xmath75 and @xmath76 denotes a @xmath17-partite state of which only the @xmath77 @xmath78 partite are @xmath32.so it is easy to see that each term in @xmath79 contains an even number of @xmath32,while each term in @xmath80 contains an odd number of @xmath32 .",
    "that means the phase qubit information of @xmath81 have been translated into the @xmath82 global - parity information .",
    "so with @xmath72 part - parity qubits information and one global - parity qubit information translated from the phase qubit , we could extract all the information encoded in any @xmath17-partite ghz bases .",
    "obviously @xmath17 ancillary qubits which are set in @xmath50 at the beginning are needed .",
    "the process for quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of @xmath17-partite ghz bases is similar , and the logic network for ghz states is shown in fig .",
    "since entanglement is introduced and preserved in the qnd measurement process , many novel applications , such as quantum authentication that involves both features of the nonlocality and qnd measurement , can be exploited .",
    "3 depicts a quantum authentication system in the quantum security automatic tell machine ( qsatm ) which employs just a logic network of bell states qnd measurement .",
    "this authentication system can be used circularly . from the figure",
    ", we can see that one of the input of the network  particle @xmath83 , and the ancilla , particle @xmath84 and @xmath85 are all kept in the qsatm . the other input , particle @xmath86 ,",
    "are stored in the qsatm credit card .",
    "particle @xmath86 and @xmath83 are set in one of the four bell states , particle @xmath84 and @xmath85 are reset to @xmath87 every time before measurement .",
    "there are two bits @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the disposer which record the bell state particle @xmath86 and @xmath83 originally in .",
    "when a user inserts the credit card into the qsatm , the logic network works , then particle @xmath84 and @xmath85 are set to states which indicates which bell state the output of particle @xmath86 and @xmath83 are in .",
    "if these states of particle @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the same as those recorded in bit @xmath88 and @xmath89 , then this credit card is verified as legal , otherwise illegal .",
    "it is evident that there is only @xmath90 probability for illegal user to pass this verification process .",
    "thus if @xmath17 pairs of bell states are employed in this system , then the probability of any illegal user passing the checkout process is @xmath91 .",
    "when @xmath17 is large enough , this probability will approach @xmath92    in practice , all the users whose authentication accuracy is higher than some definite value are considered to be legal . in this case , the new states of particle @xmath84 and @xmath85 are endowed to particle @xmath88 and @xmath89 which indicate the bell state particle @xmath86 and @xmath83 are in now .",
    "it means that as long as the decoherence of these bell states is not too serious , the system can be reset as particle @xmath86 and @xmath83 are set in a new bell state again . as illegal user",
    "can destroy the state of particle @xmath83 and thus all the verification system .",
    "it is required that only those users who have the right classical passwords have the access to quantum verification system .",
    "but anyway , only those users who pass the quantum verification system are believed to be legal , so it is much more reliable than the classical system .",
    "it is guaranteed by the basic features of the quantum mechanics .    in conclusion",
    ", we have generalized the qnd variables to the nonlocal ones by proposing quantum non - demolition measurement networks for bell states and multi - particle ghz bases with the help of controlled - not gates and hadamard gates which may be implemented on account of the recent progress in the non - linear quantum optical@xcite .",
    "one of its applications in the quantum authentication is also proposed .",
    "this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china ."
