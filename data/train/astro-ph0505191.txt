    "the hess ( high energy stereoscopic system ) collaboration has recently reported results from the first sensitive tev survey of the inner part of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "this survey revealed the existence of a population of high energy gamma - ray objects , most of which were previously unknown .",
    "these findings have an important astrophysical meaning because of the possibility of studying cosmic particle accelerators via tev observations .",
    "various types of sources in the galaxy can act as cosmic accelerators : pulsars and their pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , supernova remnants ( snr ) , star forming regions and possibly binary systems with a collapsed object like a microquasar or a pulsar . at least for two sources of the hess survey ( hess j1813 - 178 and hess",
    "j1614 - 518 ) , no known radio or x - ray counterparts have been found so far , raising the possibility that they are a new class of objects .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission , very recently confirmed by a chandra observation for hess j1303 - 631 @xcite is particularly interesting since it suggests that the accelerated particles are nucleons rather than high energy electrons .",
    "therefore , the detection of x and/or gamma - ray emission from these tev sources is a key issue to disentangle the mechanisms active in the different emitting regions and , in turn , the source nature . to perform this task ,",
    "the ibis gamma - ray imager on board integral is a powerful tool : it allows source detection above 20 kev and up to the mev range ( i.e. in the `` non thermal process '' region ) with a mcrab ( @xmath710@xmath8 erg @xmath6 s@xmath3 ) sensitivity in well exposed regions , an angular resolution of 12 arcmin and a point source location accuracy of 1 - 2 arcmin for moderately bright sources @xcite .",
    "furthermore , integral has regularly observed the entire galactic plane during the first two and half years in orbit providing , above 20 kev the first galactic survey with unprecedented sensitivity , i.e. of the order of a mcrab for 1 ms exposure @xcite . a second catalogue , utilising more sky coverage and deeper exposures , is now in the final stages of preparation @xcite .",
    "the first survey indicates clear associations for a number of tev detected objects : ax j1838.0 - 0655 @xcite , sgr a@xmath9 @xcite , msh 15 - 52/psr1509 - 58 @xcite and the crab nebula @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of a newly detected ibis / isgri source , namely igr j18135 - 1751 , that is the soft gamma - ray counterpart of the tev source hess j1813 - 178 , one of the two objects for which lack of detection in the x - ray / radio band suggested it might be a `` dark particle '' accelerator .",
    "hess j1813 - 178 is one of the 8 previously unknown sources found in the hess survey of the inner regions of the galactic plane .",
    "it is located at r.a.(2000)=18h 13 m 37.9s and dec(2000)=-17@xmath10 50 34  with a positional uncertainty in the range of 1 - 2. the source does not seem point - like although it is only slightly extended ( 3 ) , if compared to the hess point spread function . the statistical significance of the tev detection is around 9 sigma .",
    "the source is fairly bright above 200 gev with a flux of 12 @xmath1 10@xmath11 photons @xmath6 s@xmath3 .",
    "no obvious counterparts were found within the source extension , although hess j1813 - 178 lies close ( 10 ) to the radio source w33 , a bright star forming region characterized by a visually obscured compact radio core ( g12.8 - 0.2 ) located inside a molecular cloud complex @xcite ( see section 2.3 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the sky region containing hess j1813 - 178 , although covered in the first ibis / isgri survey , did not provide any significant detection due to the limited exposure dedicated to this area .",
    "the second survey @xcite represents a major improvement both in exposure time and sky coverage and makes the search for a high energy counterpart possible .",
    "the ibis coded mask instrument @xcite on board integral @xcite is made by the combination of two detector layers : isgri @xcite , an upper cdte layer sensitive in the range 20 kev to 1 mev and picsit @xcite a bottom csi layer sensitive in the range 200 kev to 8 mev . in the present paper",
    ", we refer to data collected with the low energy isgri detector , as the source is only detected at low energy , namely in the range 20 - 100 kev .",
    "data reported here belong to the core program ( i.e. were collected as part of the integral galactic plane survey and galactic center deep exposure @xcite ) as well as to public open time observations , and span from revolution 46 ( february 2003 ) to revolution 210 ( march 2004 ) included .",
    "a detailed description of the source extraction criteria can be found in bird et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) : briefly , isgri images for each available pointing are generated in ten narrow energy bands using the integral science data center ( isdc ) offline scientific analysis software osa version 4.1 @xcite , including background uniformity corrections @xcite .",
    "source ghosts are removed from each image using a catalogue of sources built iteratively and containing at the end all detected objects .",
    "the @xmath0 7000 images are then mosaiced using a custom tool to produce deep all - sky maps ; finally images from adjacent energy bands are added together to obtain a map in a given energy range , which is then used for peak detection .",
    "the primary search tool used is sextractor @xcite employing a simple gaussian point spread function filter .",
    "sources are then searched for in various energy bands above a given , quite conservative , sensitivity threshold ( typically 6 sigma ) and then included in the ibis / isgri catalogue list .",
    "as a further check the map is visually inspected to confirm detection and avoid spurious excesses due to imperfect image cleaning .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the 20 - 40 kev band image of the region surrounding hess j1813 - 178 : coincident with the tev object an ibis / isgri source ( igr j18135 - 1751 ) is detected with a significance exceeding 10@xmath12 at r.a.(2000)= 18h 13 m 27.12s and dec(2000)= -17@xmath10 50 56  and with a positional uncertainty of @xmath02 , corresponding to 90% error for a 10 sigma source @xcite .",
    "apart from the source of interest here , two other bright objects are visible in the map : the low mass x - ray binary gx 13 + 1 and the transient source sax j1818.6 - 1703 , approximately 44 and 87 away from the new ibis / isgri source .",
    "contamination from the bright source gx13 + 1 is unlikely as igr j18135 - 1751 is well outside the major peak of the psf and does not appear to be coincident with any systematic structure from that source .",
    "other structures present in the region containing the source have been carefully checked in terms of statistical significance and psf : they are all below the threshold to be possibly considered real sources and do not fit with the expected ibis detector spatial response @xcite .",
    "the hess j1813 - 178 source is inside the first isgri contour indicating a clear spatial association between the ibis / isgri object and the tev source , while the formal distance between the two sources is less than 2.2 arcmin .",
    "the mean count rate of igr j18135 - 1751 is 0.139@xmath130.015 and 0.093 @xmath130.016 counts s@xmath3 in the 20 - 40 and 40 - 100 kev bands respectively ; these count rates correspond to a flux of 1.3 and 2.1 mcrab respectively or to an average flux of 2.1@xmath110@xmath8 erg @xmath14 in the 20 - 100 kev band .",
    "the flux relative to each individual pointing has been used to generate the source light curves in different energy bands .",
    "no burst or flares are visible in the light curves , nor does the source show any sign of variability ; unfortunately the low significance of the detection prevents the search for pulsations in the ibis / isgri data .",
    "we have also searched the heasarc archive ( www.heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) for the presence of the source in the data of past x - ray missions .",
    "hess j1813 - 178 is located in the galactic plane , so that it is likely that its x - ray counterpart is heavily absorbed .",
    "the galactic hi column density in the source direction is 1.89 @xmath1 10@xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite ; this value implies strong depletion of soft x - rays , more so if molecular hydrogen is added to the column density estimation .",
    "it is therefore likely that any soft x - ray emission is either very weak or undetected .",
    "there is no rosat source inside the hess error circle , although a wgacat object ( 1wga j1813.7 - 1755 ) is only 5.4 from the tev position ; this x - ray source is associated with the 10.8 v magnitude star , hd166981 , of spectral type b8 . despite being very close ,",
    "this soft x - ray source is outside both the ibis / isgri error circle and the hess extension .",
    "similarly other soft x - ray emitters are all located further away ( more than 10 from the tev source ) and so are incompatible with the hess / integral positional uncertainty . at higher energies , we found a possible counterpart in the asca archive data : agps273.4 - 17.8 , which is clearly detected by both the sis and gis instruments .",
    "the sky region surrounding this x - ray source is strongly contaminated ( particularly in the gis image ) by the presence of a very bright nearby object ( likely gx13 + 1 ) and this is probably the reason why agps273.4 - 17.8 does not appear in the asca galactic plane survey @xcite despite its detection ; for this reason we consider here only the sis data .",
    "the asca position is set at r.a.(2000 ) = 18h 13 m 35.8s and dec(2000 ) = -17@xmath10 49 43.35  with an associated uncertainty of 1 in radius and is therefore contained within the first ibis / isgri contour . in the x - ray band",
    "the source is fairly bright showing a 2 - 10 kev flux ( corrected for absorption ) of 1.8 @xmath1 10@xmath8 erg @xmath6 s@xmath3 ; the broad band spectrum ( after background subtraction and correction ) is characterized by an absorbed power law with a hard photon index @xmath15=1.76@xmath16 and a column density n@xmath17=5.15@xmath18 @xmath1 10@xmath5 @xmath6 in excess of the galactic value ( errors correspond to 90% confidence level for a single parameter variation , i.e. @xmath19@xmath20=2.7 , see xspec v11.3 manual ) . on top of this power law ,",
    "the source shows marginal evidence of an extended soft emission ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the best fit to this component is obtained with a thermal bremsstrahlung with kt=0.42@xmath21 kev , absorbed by a column density compatible with the galactic value .",
    "however , the total emitted power of this possible soft excess , not detected by brogan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , is irrelevant being 50 - 100 times less than the synchrotron power law component .",
    "the sis light curve shows no variability over the 100ks observation period and the minimum data binning of 300 s prevents the search for fast pulsation .",
    "detection by asca and integral over different observing periods suggests that the source is a persistent rather than a transient object .",
    "+      the column density measured in x - rays ( galactic plus intrinsic ) implies a visual extinction av@xmath027 @xcite , sufficient to obscure any optical counterpart . therefore searches for candidate objects at shorter frequencies should concentrate on data less affected by absorption , such as in the radio waveband .",
    "indeed , we find a bright nvss ( nrao vla sky survey , @xcite ) , radio source within the asca positional uncertainty : nvss j181334 - 174849 with coordinates",
    "r.a.(2000)=18h 13 m 34.32s and dec(2000)=-17@xmath10 48 49.1  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this source has a 20 cm flux of 327 mjy , a positional uncertainty of only 1 `` and it is not polarized ; the source axes are 1.85 and 1.25 ( ellipse in fig . [ fig2 ] ) , indicating that the object is probably extended at 20 cm .",
    "it is located in a crowded region showing 3 other objects , all of which have much lower flux at 20 cm .",
    "this radio complex is contained within both the ibis / hess circles , but only the bright object , nvss j181334 - 174849 , is possibly associated to the asca source . within its 1 '' positional uncertainty , we do not find any optical and/or infrared counterpart .",
    "recently , brogan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have discovered non  thermal radio emission from a young shell type snr ( g12.8 - 0.02 ) associated with the radio complex nvss .",
    "the source is reported as extended ( 3 ) , located at a distance @xmath22 4 kpc and is positional coincident with hess j1813 - 178 .",
    "helfand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) conclude the tev emission is due to inverse compton scattering of starlight from w33 off the high energy electrons from g12.8 - 0.02 responsible for synchrotron x - ray emission .    finally , there are 4 radio pulsars within 30 of hess j1813 - 178 , but despite being potential candidates , their distances from hess j1813 - 178 argue against a possible association . clearly",
    "a search for likely candidates inside the hess source extension is the best way to approach the problem of source identification .",
    "this is possible via archive data as well as through dedicated observations such as those performed by integral .",
    "the basic evidence of the present work is that hess j1813 - 178 has an x - ray counterpart with a power law emission from 2 to 10 kev , a coincident soft gamma - ray source emitting up to 100 kev and an associated radio counterpart .",
    "the presence of a spatially - coincident x to soft gamma - ray flux , with a power law type emission process , rules out the hypothesis that this source belongs to a `` new class '' of galactic objects or that it is a cosmic `` dark particle '' accelerator : it is a non - thermal source , accelerating electrons and positrons which radiate through synchrotron and inverse compton mechanism .",
    "this is suggestive of the presence of a pwn / snr , as already found in most newly detected tev objects ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005a , b and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , ibis / isgri preferentially sees plerionic type supernovae : 6 out of 7 remnants detected in the second catalogue are associated with pulsar wind nebulae and only one ( casa ) has a shell type morphology @xcite .",
    "our findings are in agreement with the recent radio results of brogan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and helfand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; this indicates that indeed we are dealing with a shell type supernova remnant .",
    "however , it can not be ruled out at this stage that this supernova is of composite type , e.g. a centrally filled morphology embedded inside a shell like remnant . in these objects ,",
    "the central radio / x - ray emission is interpreted as synchrotron radiation from a bubble of relativistic particles supplied by the central source which is generally an isolated spinning down pulsar like psr 1509 - 58 .",
    "unfortunately , the weakness of the gamma - ray signal and the integration time of the x - ray data do not permit further investigation of a possible pulsed emission .",
    "on the other hand , the binary scenario , e.g. a typology similar to hess / psr b1259 - 63 , where the gamma - rays are generated by inverse compton scattering of electrons at the termination shock region of the pulsar wind of the companion star photons , is unlikely .",
    "apart from the radio results , these systems have variable emission which is not present in our data .",
    "in fact , a long integration time is necessary to detect the gamma - ray source in view of its weakness and the asca x - ray data are compatible with no flux variation over the total observing time of about 100 ks . the good spectral match between integral and asca data",
    "can be taken as further evidence for a constant x / gamma - ray emission .",
    "+ finally , the scenario proposed by helfand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) where the tev source is due to the up - scattering of starlight from w33 by electrons accelerated in the snr , is not incompatible with the ibis / isgri detection .",
    "the source luminosity is 4 and 3.4 ( d / d@xmath23)@xmath20 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ( where d is the distance of the source and d@xmath23 = 4kpc ) in the 2 - 10 and 20 - 100 kev bands , respectively to be compared to a 0.2 - 10 tev luminosity of 1.2 - 1.9 ( d / d@xmath23)@xmath20 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "these values are both compatible with those observed for a few hess sources which have been clearly associated with either shell type or plerionic type supernova remnants @xcite . the source spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from x - ray to tev is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , together with the crab pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the shape of the sed resembles that of the crab pulsar wind nebula , although with a quite different x - ray / tev gamma - ray ratio .",
    "future xmm - newton or chandra observations could definitively unveil the true nature of this source .",
    "+ we acknowledge the following funding agencies : in italy , italian space agency financial and programmatic support via contracts i / r/046/04 ; in the uk pparc grant gr/2002/ 00446 .",
