    "by now the composite fermion model is well established in fractional quantum hall effect . proposed originally by jain @xcite in order to describe the fractional quantum hall states ( qhs ) , it was field theoretically developed by lopez and fradkin @xcite , and halperin , lee , and read @xcite who studied the model near the filling fraction @xmath0 . many experiments @xcite have also confirmed the existence of composite fermions .",
    "subsequently , the composite fermion ( cf ) picture has been extended to describe qhs with arbitrary polarization , by mandal and ravishankar @xcite . the model , which we shall call the doublet model , employs a doublet of chern - simons ( cs ) gauge fields corresponding to two spin degrees of freedom . mandal and ravishankar have shown that almost all the observed quantum hall states can be described by the mean field ( mf ) of cs gauge fields .",
    "they have also studied the fluctuations about mf configurations .",
    "they have further studied @xcite charge density and spin density excitations @xmath1 for these arbitrarily polarized qhs ( apqhs ) using time dependent hartree - fock approximation ( tdhfa ) for the coulomb interaction between cf s .    in this paper",
    ", we further study the spin flip and spin wave excitations @xmath2 for apqhs .",
    "et al _  @xcite were the first to observe experimentally the electron spin resonance corresponding to spin wave excitations in odd integer qhs .",
    "this type of excitations is possible only for odd integer qhs ; for then , if the lande @xmath3 factor is small , one spin state in the topmost filled landau level ( ll ) will be filled , leaving the other closeby spin state unoccupied .",
    "spin flip and spin wave excitations in these systems were first studied theoretically by kallin and halperin @xcite .",
    "they employed a diagrammatic approach which is equivalent to tdhfa for the coulomb interactions between electrons .",
    "subsequently , longo and kallin  @xcite extended the analysis of spin flip excitations to partial filling factors .",
    "they speculated that the change in the energy of excitations due to the coulomb interactions is simply the filling factor times the corresponding value for fully filled lowest ll ; the lowest energy required for spin flip excitations is the cyclotron energy .",
    "in fact , we show below that the change in the energy of excitations due to the coulomb interactions between composite fermions for a given fractional filling factor in the lowest ll is equal to the corresponding value of energy for the corresponding value of fully filled integer state . in other words ,",
    "all the qhs in the lowest ll which have the same numerator have the same spin flip excitation energy .",
    "further , the lowest mode corresponding to the spin flip excitations is the effective cyclotron energy of the cf , in consistency with what we expect from cf picture .",
    "we show that the cs field fluctuations do not contribute to the spin flip correlation functions ( sfcf ) .",
    "the latter hence may be determined exactly ( without making an expansion in wave vector ) .",
    "moreover , it is the same for all the states which have identical number of fully filled effective ll .",
    "we find that the coulomb interaction between cf s produces an additional gap for spin flip excitations , in general . on the other hand ,",
    "spin wave modes are gapless as @xmath4 , as required by larmor s theorem .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly reintroduce the doublet model and then present the formalism for determining sfcf corresponding to spin density excitations ( sde ) with @xmath5 . in section iii , we evaluate sfcf in the tdhfa by a diagrammatic approach for the coulomb interaction between the cf . in section iv , we present spin flip and spin wave excitations for apqhs .",
