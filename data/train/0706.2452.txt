    "in a theoretical study , pendry et al . reported a general method for the design of electromagnetic materials based on form - invariant transformations of maxwell s equations @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the methodology of transformation optics was applied to find the specification for an electromagnetic cloak - a complex material capable of rendering objects within its interior invisible to detection .",
    "although just one example of the many intriguing structures possible using the transformation optical approach , the proposed cloak design generated enormous interest in its own right .",
    "an approximation to the invisibility cloak based on metamaterials was subsequently realized by schurig et al . , who demonstrated the cloaking mechanism in microwave experiments @xcite .",
    "the transformation optical approach to invisibility is quite general , differing in scope from prior related work .",
    "indeed , methods of reducing the electromagnetic scattering of objects at radar frequencies have long been a subject of intense research @xcite . on the nanoscale , techniques",
    "have also been suggested to reduce the scattering of one or more multipole components of size - limited objects using tailored negative index or negative permittivity coatings @xcite .",
    "more recently , a mathematically rigorous proof of an invisibility structure based on active devices was reported @xcite .",
    "transformation optics provides for a conceptually simple approach to the design of complex electromagnetic structures : one imagines warping space to achieve the desired electromagnetic functionality .",
    "the trajectories of electromagnetic waves passing through a region of warped space must conform to the local metric , and this provides an alternative ( though conceptual ) means to control and manipulate electromagnetic fields .",
    "once the desired design is determined , the coordinate transformation and its jacobi matrix determine the transformation of maxwell s equations and the constitutive relations .",
    "the result provides the specification for an electromagnetic structure that is complex - being inhomogeneous and anisotropic - but realizable for example through artificially structured metamaterials .",
    "indeed , because the fields in a volume bounding a transformation optical structure are identical to those that would exist where the structure is replaced by free space , anisotropy is necessary to circumvent uniqueness constraints @xcite .",
    "if the coordinate transformation can be realized exactly in the constitutive parameters , all aspects of wave propagation will be transformed by the structure , including the near - fields .",
    "adding constraints to the materials reduces the ultimate performance of the structure , but nevertheless can still allow for interesting and novel structures .",
    "leonhardt , for example , has shown that if the materials are restricted to be isotropic , an approximate cloak can be constructed that is valid in the geometrical optic limit @xcite .",
    "likewise , constraints were employed for the metamaterial cloak utilized by schurig et al .  to ease the metamaterial design and fabrication , resulting in a structure that produced significant reflection yet still demonstrated the cloaking mechanism for transmitted waves @xcite .",
    "since the concept of transformation optics was introduced , there have been a growing number of subsequent reports applying the method to a variety of electromagnetic , acoustic and elasto - mechanical structures @xcite .",
    "full wave simulations have helped to confirm the expected behavior and have provided a platform to explore systematically the effects of absorption , imperfections and other constraints that are inherent to fabricated realizations of the transformation optical structures @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present two examples that demonstrate the general applicability of form - invariant coordinate transformations for the design of complex , inhomogeneous and anisotropic electromagnetic materials with well - defined functionality . for the first example",
    ", we derive the electromagnetic constitutive parameters corresponding to a two - dimensional electromagnetic cloak having square cross - section .",
    "the square shape has been chosen to illustrate the nature of the transformation - and the resulting design - for a structure that lacks rotational symmetry in the plane .",
    "in contrast to the cylindrical cloaks with circular cross - section previously presented , the square cloak design results in a non - orthogonal transformation producing a more complicated specification for the spatially dependent permittivity and permeability tensors . the method to design this structure , however , can be applied to the design of structures with arbitrary shape .    for the second example",
    ", we derive the material properties of an electromagnetic field concentrator by the same approach .",
    "the purpose of the cylindrical concentrator is to focus incident electromagnetic waves with wave vectors perpendicular to the cylinder axis , enhancing the electromagnetic energy density of incident waves in a given area .",
    "this example illustrates the strength of the transformation - optical approach for designing devices other than cloaks .",
    "in this section , the formulas describing the spatial coordinate transformations and the calculation of the resulting material parameters , i.  e.  the electric permittivity tensor and the magnetic permeability tensor , are derived .",

    "for all the transformations considered in the next sections , the mathematical starting point is three - dimensional , euclidian space expressed in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath23 . from the physical point of view",
    ", the space is considered to be medium - free ( vacuum ) and isotropic .",
    "thus , the permittivity tensor @xmath24 and the permeability tensor @xmath25 of the original space can be expressed in the form @xmath26 with ( @xmath27 ) for ( @xmath28 ) and ( @xmath29 ) elsewhere .",
    "the coordinate transformation equations for the electromagnetic design of a square - shaped cloak with a sidelength @xmath30 of the inner square and a sidelength @xmath31 of the outer square ( see fig.[fig : sqcloaktrafo]a ) are expressed by @xmath32 with the jacobi matrix and its determinant @xmath33 for ( @xmath34 ) , ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 and ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it should be noted , that , by the foregoing definitions , the transformation equations ( [ formula : sqtrafo1])-([formula : sqtrafo3 ] ) are only defined for the green shadowed area in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqcloaktrafo]a and that the transformation is continuous at the boundary of the transformed domain . the corresponding transformation formulas for the upper , left , and lower domain of the square cloak can be readily obtained by applying rotation operators with rotation angles of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 around the @xmath41-axis to equations ( [ formula : sqtrafo1])-([formula : sqtrafo3 ] ) .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sqcloaktrafo]b , the transformation expands the space within the inner square at the expense of a compression of space between the inner and outer square .        inserting equations ( [ formula : jacobisqcloak]- [ formula : detjacobisqcloak ] ) , ( [ formula : epsisotropic]-[formula : muisotropic ] ) into ( [ formula : epsilon ] ) and ( [ formula : mu ] ) , applying the reverse transformations @xmath42 of ( [ formula : sqtrafo1])-([formula : sqtrafo3 ] ) and dividing ( [ formula : epsilon ] ) by @xmath43 and ( [ formula : mu ] ) by @xmath44 yields the relative permittivity and the relative permeability tensors @xmath45 and @xmath46 , expressed in the coordinates @xmath47 of the transformed space , as @xmath48 with @xmath49 due to the natural invariance of the minkowski equations ( as discussed in @xcite ) , the permittivity and permeability tensors can also be interpreted as the material properties of a medium described in the coordinate system of the original space by substituting the primed indices by unprimed indices (  material interpretation  ) .",
    "again it should be noted , that the material properties ( [ formula : epsmutrafo ] ) are only valid in the green shadowed region of fig .",
    "[ fig : sqcloaktrafo]a and that , due to the symmetry of the cloak , the material properties of the other cloak domains can be readily obtained by rotating the tensors in ( [ formula : epsmutrafo ] ) by @xmath50 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . furthermore , the relative permittivity and permeability tensors are non - diagonal , which is a direct consequence of the non - conformality of the transformation ( [ formula : sqtrafo1])-([formula : sqtrafo3 ] ) . however , in terms of fabricating such a material , it is desirable to have the material parameters denoted in their eigenbasis , where the permittivity and permeability tensors are diagonal . due to the symmetry of the tensors",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 , an eigenbasis solution always exists and one obtains @xmath53 @xmath54 with @xmath55 notice , that the primes were omitted to express the electromagnetic parameters in the material interpretation . due to the spatial dependence of the elements of the permittivity and permeability tensors , the orientation of the basis vectors @xmath56 of the eigenbasis depends on the spatial location @xmath57 within the cloak material .",

    "the graph shows the rotation angle of the eigenbasis vectors @xmath56 in dependence on the location @xmath60 at different positions @xmath61 .",

    "[ fig : sqcloaktrafo]a .",
    "the rotation angle of the eigenbasis with refer to the coordinate system @xmath57 varies within a range from 1.3 to 1.8 rad . in order to fabricate such a medium as a metamaterial , the principle axes of the unit cells have to be individually aligned along the basis vectors @xmath62 of the eigenbasis .    figures [ fig : sqcloakrotgrid]b - d show the values of the relative permeabilities @xmath63 and @xmath64 and the relative permittivity @xmath65 in dependence on the location within the cloak .",
    "these three physical quantities deliver a full description of the propagation behavior of an electromagnetic wave with a linear polarization vector of the electric field oriented along the z - direction .",
    "the depicted area corresponds to the green shadowed region in fig.[fig : sqcloaktrafo]a .",
    "as opposed to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the value of @xmath68 diverges at the boundary of the inner square of the cloak .",
    "however , at a distance of about 1.6  mm from the inner boundary of the square cloak , @xmath68 already approaches finite values below 35 as determined along a straight intersection line parallel to the y - axis at @xmath69  cm .",
    "please note , that fig.[fig : sqcloakrotgrid]b only displays the permeability @xmath68 for @xmath70  cm and thus does not show the divergence of the relative permeability towards the inner boundary of the cloak .",
    "however , assuming a typical unit cell size of 3.3  mm for a fabricated effective medium at a working frequency of 8.5  ghz , the value of @xmath68 at the midpoint of the unit cells at the inner boundary of the cloak is between 19 and 35 , so that an implementation of such a material is still possible .",
    "although the effective @xmath68 is inaccurate in the vicinity of the boundary of the inner square , it can be shown , that the performance of the implemented device is not affected by this fact , which is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "due to its cylindrical symmetry , it is convenient to describe the transformation equations in a cylindrical coordinate system . in this context , it is necessary to consider the transformation from cartesian to cylindrical coordinates for an isotropic medium with permittivity @xmath71 and permeability @xmath72 . with the transformation @xmath73 and equations ( [ formula : epsilon ] ) and ( [ formula : mu ] ) one obtains @xmath74 at this point ,",

    "the experimental implementation of such a material requires independent control of the local values of all three parameters .",
    "the metamaterial design and fabrication is part of current research .",
    "for the full wave electromagnetic simulations a two - dimensional finite - element solver of the comsol multiphysics software package was used . the computational domain and its boundaries are shown in fig .",

    "the calculations did not include absorption in the object .",
    "the finite - element solver required all physical quantities to be described in cartesian coordinates .",

    "the sidelengths of the inner and outer square of the cloak are 6  cm and 12  cm , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cloak1]a , the phase fronts of the impinging wave are parallely aligned to one of the sides of the cloak .",
    "as can be seen , the wave is smoothly bent around the cloaked area and the phase fronts are completely restored when the wave exits the cloak material .",
    "the inhomogeneity and the anisotropy of the cloak medium are evident as the direction of the power flow and the phase front normal are not parallel and the angle between the directions changes locally . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cloak1]b , the cloak is rotated by an angle of @xmath96 with respect to the phase fronts of the incoming wave . in this configuration , the phase fronts are no longer parallel to any side of the square cloak . as before ,",
    "the phase fronts are completely restored after propagation through the cloak material and the inner square is not sensed by the wave . in both cases , the wave impedances of the cloak medium and free space are exactly matched and the device is therefore reflectionless .",
    "the square - shaped cloak is an example of a cloak with reduced symmetry in comparison to a cylindric cloak .",
    "in addition , the square cloak possesses sharp corners .",
    "the simulations clearly show , that the transformation - optical cloak design is not restricted by cylindric symmetry requirements . in principle , cloaks of arbitrary shape can be designed by use of the transformation - optical approach .      in section [ subsec : trafo_concentrator ] , the material properties of a concentrator were described in a cylindrical coordinate system . in cartesian",

    "the free - space frequency of the te wave is 8.5  ghz .",

    "it is obvious , that the field intensities are strongly enhanced in the inner region of radius @xmath82 within the concentrator material .",
    "the intensity enhancement factor for the chosen structure , computed as the ratio between the maximal values of the field intensities outside the circular region with radius @xmath108 and inside the concentrator region with radius @xmath82 , is 2 .",
    "significantly stronger enhancements can be achieved by increasing the ratio @xmath109 . as can be seen",
    ", the enhancement theoretically diverges to infinity as @xmath82 goes to zero .    due to the rotational symmetry around the axis perpendicular to the @xmath110-@xmath111-plane , the concentrator focusses waves impinging from arbitrary directions .",

    "although metamaterials , which are necessary to implement the material properties of a concentrator , inherently suffer from losses , we think , that the concentrator can play an important role in the harnessing of light in solar cells or similar devices , where high field intensities are required .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented the material design of a square - shaped cloak and an electromagnetic field concentrator based on form - invariant transformations of maxwell s equations .",
