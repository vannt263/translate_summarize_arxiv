    "the constraints on the neutrino magnetic moment in direct laboratory experiments have been obtained so far from the lack of any observable distortion of the recoil electron energy spectrum .",
    "experiments of this type have started about 40 years ago .",
    "the strategy applied during all these years in reactor experiments is rather simple : minimize the threshold on the recoil energy for the detection of the scattered electron , keeping at the same time a reasonable background level . since the region of interest coincides with the energy region dominated by radioactivity , low intrinsic radioactivity detectors have been employed together with active and passive shields .",
    "in addition , all the experiments were running inside laboratories with significant overburden of concrete , corresponding to several meters of water .",
    "this was enough to suppress the soft component of cosmic rays .",
    "in all the experiments , with one exception only , the signal due to the antineutrinos from the reactor ( about @xmath268 ) is obtained from the difference between the reactor - on and reactor - off rate .",

    "one of the examples in which it is possible to avoid the neutrino magnetic moment being proportional to a ( small ) neutrino mass , that would in principle make a neutrino magnetic moment accessible for experimental observations , is realized in the left - right symmetric models considered at the end of section  [ sec : theoretical ] .",

    "the results obtained within the minimal supersymmetric standard model with @xmath298-parity violating interactions @xcite show that the majorana transition magnetic moment might be significantly above the scale of ( [ mu_3_10_19 ] ) .    considering the problem of large neutrino magnetic moments , one can write down a generic relation between the size of a neutrino magnetic moment @xmath251 and the corresponding neutrino mass @xmath299 @xcite",
    ". suppose that a large neutrino magnetic moment is generated by physics beyond a minimal extension of the standard model at an energy scale characterized by @xmath300 .",
    "for a generic diagram corresponding to this contribution to @xmath251 , one can again use the feynman graph in fig .",

    "it follows that , generally , in theoretical models that predict large values for the neutrino magnetic moment , simultaneously large contributions to the neutrino mass arise .",
    "therefore , a particular fine tuning is needed to get a large value for the neutrino magnetic moment while keeping the neutrino mass within experimental bounds .",
    "one of the possibilities @xcite is based on the idea of suppressing the ratio @xmath305 with a symmetry : if a @xmath306 symmetry is an exact symmetry of the lagrangian of a model , because of different symmetry properties of the mass and magnetic moment even a massless neutrino can have a nonzero magnetic moment . if , as it happens in a realistic model , the @xmath306 symmetry is broken and if this breaking is small , the ratio @xmath305 is also small , giving a natural way to obtain a magnetic moment of the order of @xmath307 without contradictions with the neutrino mass experimental constraints .",
    "several possibilities based on the general idea of @xcite were considered in @xcite .",
    "another idea of neutrino mass suppression without suppression of the neutrino magnetic moment was discussed in @xcite within the zee model @xcite , which is based on the standard model gauge group @xmath308 and contains at least three higgs doublets and a charged field which is a singlet of @xmath309 . for this kind of models",

    "( [ mu_lambda1 ] ) arises from the quadratic divergence in the renormalization of the dimension - four neutrino mass operator .",
    "a general and model - independent upper bound on the dirac neutrino magnetic moment , which can be generated by an effective theory beyond the standard model , has been derived @xcite from the demand of absence of fine - tuning of effective operator coefficients and from the current experimental information on neutrino masses .",

    "the model - independent limit on a majorana neutrino transition magnetic moment @xmath331 was also discussed in @xcite .",

    "the main results discussed in the paper can be summed up as follows .    in the most general case ,",
    "the neutrino electromagnetic vertex function is defined in terms of four form factors : the charge , dipole magnetic and electric and anapole form factors .",

    "the four form factors at zero momentum transfer @xmath507 are , respectively , the neutrino charge , magnetic moment , electric moment and anapole moment .",
    "these quantities contribute to elements of the scattering matrix and describe neutrino interactions with real photons .",
    "an important characteristic of neutrino electromagnetic properties is that they are different for dirac and majorana neutrinos .",
    "in particular , majorana neutrinos can not have diagonal magnetic or electric moments .",
    "thus , studies of neutrino electromagnetic interactions can be used as a procedure to distinguish whether a neutrino is a dirac or majorana particle .",
    "moreover , cp invariance in the lepton sector puts additional constraints on the neutrino form factors and can be tested with experimental probes of neutrino electromagnetic interactions .    up to now , no effect of neutrino electromagnetic properties has been found in terrestrial laboratory experiments and in the analyses of astrophysical and cosmological data",
    ". however , massive neutrinos have non - trivial electromagnetic properties in a wide set of theoretical frameworks , including the simplest extension of the standard model with inclusion of singlet right - handed neutrinos .",
    "therefore , the search for non - vanishing neutrino electromagnetic properties is of great interest for experimentalist and theorists .",
    "the neutrino dipole magnetic ( and also electric ) moment is theoretically the most well studied and understood among the neutrino electromagnetic moments . in models which extend the standard model with the addition of singlet right - handed neutrinos , a dirac neutrino has a non - zero magnetic moment proportional to the neutrino mass , that yields a very small value for the magnetic moment , less than about @xmath508 for a neutrino mass smaller than 1 ev ( eq .  ( [ mu_3_10_19 ] ) ) .",
    "extra terms contributing to the magnetic moment of the neutrino that are not proportional to the neutrino mass may exist , for example , in the framework of left - right symmetric models . in this type of models , as well as in other generalizations of the standard model , as for instance in supersymmetric and extra - dimension models , values of the neutrino magnetic moment much larger than @xmath509 can be obtained .",
    "the most severe terrestrial experimental upper bound for the effective electron antineutrino magnetic moment , @xmath510 at 90% c.l .",
    "( [ lim - gemma ] ) ) , has been recently obtained in the direct antineutrino - electron scattering experiment performed by the gemma collaboration @xcite .",
    "this value is still about an order of magnitude weaker than the upper bound @xmath511 ( eq .  ( [ p02 ] ) )",
    "obtained from astrophysics ( considering the cooling of red giant stars ) @xcite .",
    "there is a gap of some orders of magnitude between the present experimental limits @xmath512 on neutrino magnetic moments and the predictions of different extensions of the standard model which hint at a range @xmath513 @xcite ( see section  ( [ sec : theoretical ] ) ) .",
    "the terrestrial experimental constraints have been improved by only one order of magnitude during a period of about twenty years .",
    "further improvements are very important , but unfortunately at the moment there is no new idea which could lead to fast improvements in the near future . on the other hand , astrophysical studies could allow significant improvements of the sensitivity to non - trivial neutrino electromagnetic properties and maybe find a positive indication in their favor .",
    "in particular , neutrino flows in extreme astrophysical environments with very strong magnetic fields are sensitive to small values of the neutrino electromagnetic moments .",
    "an example is the modelling of neutrinos propagation during core - collapse supernovae ( see @xcite and references therein ) where very strong magnetic fields are believed to exist and in which the influence of neutrino electromagnetic properties has not yet been taken into account .",
