    "the possibility of combining ferroelectric and magnetic order in a material is of great interest from the point of view of fundamental condensed matter physics and of technology @xcite .",
    "although the microscopic nature of materials usually excludes this coexistence , there are a growing number of systems where spontaneous electrical and magnetic polarization exist in the same phase .",
    "these are examples of multiferroic materials ( the general term describing systems where more than one of the ferroic order parameters are nonzero in the same phase ) and have been of growing interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "the system @xmath4mno@xmath0 ( where @xmath4 is a trivalent ion ) has been widely studied in this context due to the coexistence , in some of the members of this series , of ferroelectric and magnetic order .",
    "the nature of the @xmath5 ion is central to determining the structural , ferroelectric and magnetic properties of members of this system .",
    "bimno@xmath0 has been the subject of much research interest , partly because its relative structural simplicity makes it amenable to study using first - principals theoretical techniques @xcite .",
    "early experimental work on the material was sparse , in part due to the requirement of high pressures in the preparation of the compound , and reports of ferroelectricity were initially speculative @xcite . a detailed structural study @xcite suggested that the material has a highly distorted perovskite structure ( monoclinic space group @xmath6 ) , shown in figure ( [ muonsite ] ) , which is consistent with the existence of ferroelectricity .",
    "subsequent theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite also pointed to a coexistence of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering at low temperature .",
    "ferroelectric ordering was proposed to take place below @xmath7  k @xcite induced by a centrosymmetric to non - centrosymmetric structural transition , although it was also suggested @xcite that the ferroelectricity accompanied a structural transition occurring at 450  k without a change in symmetry .    the different structure and magnetic properties of bimno@xmath0 in comparison to other @xmath4mno@xmath0 manganites ,",
    "( which are antiferromagnetic and either orthorhombic or hexagonal ) has been ascribed to the presence of the lone pair on bismuth @xcite and the covalent nature of the bi  o bonds which introduce additional orbital interactions ( in contrast to the other @xmath4mno@xmath0 manganites , where the bonding is essentially ionic @xcite ) .",
    "it was proposed that these interactions lead to orbital order below the centrosymmetric to non - centrosymmetric transition at 770  k @xcite .",
    "the orbital order , in turn , fosters three dimensional ferromagnetic interactions in this material @xcite causing the material to undergo a ferromagnetic ordering transition at a curie temperature @xmath2 , reported to be @xmath8@xmath9  k @xcite . the magnetic ordering transition results in a collinear magnetic structure @xcite where the mn@xmath3 ions ( 3d@xmath10 , @xmath11 ) align along the @xmath12 axis ( figure ( [ muonsite ] ) ) .",
    "recently , detailed stuctural studies have suggested that , in contrast to the state of affairs described above , bimno@xmath0 actually crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group @xmath13 at 300  k @xcite .",
    "this is incompatible with the existence of ferroelectricity and may necessitate a major revision of our view of this material .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that the large dielectric anomaly observed near @xmath2 may be linked to structural distortions occurring near this temperature regime rather than to effects related to broken inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "he we confine our discussion to the magnetic properties of bimno@xmath0 .",
    "muons are a sensitive probe of magnetism in condensed matter @xcite and allow us to investigate magnetism from a local viewpoint . in this paper we present the results of a zero - field ( zf )",
    "muon - spin relaxation ( @xmath14sr ) study of the local magnetic properties of bimno@xmath0 .",
    "we have probed the magnetic field distribution both below and above @xmath2 , allowing us to follow the temperature evolution of the order parameter in the magnetically ordered phase and to investigate the magnetic fluctuations in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "our measurements also allow us to identify candidate muon stopping sites in the material .",
    "a polycrystalline sample of bimno@xmath0 was prepared using the method reported previously @xcite , which involves heating a mixed powder of bi@xmath15o@xmath0 , mn@xmath15o@xmath0 and mno@xmath15 to 700  @xmath16c under 3  gpa of pressure for 30 minutes .",
    "the structural character of the sample was checked using x - ray diffraction , while the bulk magnetic properties of the sample were measured using a commercial magnetometer .    in a @xmath14sr experiment ,",
    "spin - polarized positive muons are stopped in a target sample , where the muon usually occupies an interstitial position in the crystal .",
    "the observed property in the experiment is the time evolution of the muon spin polarization , the behavior of which depends on the local magnetic field @xmath17 at the muon site , and which is proportional to the positron asymmetry function @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "zf @xmath14sr measurements were made on bimno@xmath0 using the gps instrument at the swiss muon source ( s@xmath19s ) , paul scherrer institute , villigen , switzerland .",
    "the sample was wrapped in a silver foil packet ( foil thickness 25  @xmath19 m ) and mounted on a silver backing plate .",
    "silver is used as it possesses only a small nuclear moment and so minimizes any background depolarizing signal .",
    "figure [ magnetization ] shows the results of magnetization measurements made on our sample as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field . as seen in previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the magnetic transition is evident close to 100  k ( figure [ magnetization](a ) ) . in an applied magnetic field",
    "the magnetic moment is seen , at low temperatures , to approach a saturation value of around @xmath20 ( figure [ magnetization](b ) ) , as was also observed previously ( see above ) .",
    "example zf @xmath14sr spectra measured at s@xmath19s on bimno@xmath0 are shown in figure  [ bidat ] . at temperatures below @xmath21  k and for times @xmath22s ,",
    "we observe oscillations in the asymmetry spectra ( figure  [ bidat](a ) ) .",
    "these are characteristic of a quasistatic local magnetic field at the muon site , which causes a coherent precession of the spins of those muons with a component of their spin polarization perpendicular to this local field ; their presence provides strong evidence for the existence of long range magnetic order in this phase , in agreement with previous magnetic measurements .",
    "the frequency of the oscillations is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath25  mhz t@xmath26 ) and @xmath27 is the local field at the @xmath28th muon site .",
    "in the presence of a distribution of local magnetic fields the oscillations are expected to relax with a depolarization rate @xmath29 .",
    "one precession frequency is observed in the measured spectra ( see _ inset _ figure  [ bidat](a ) ) , corresponding to a magnetically unique muon site in the material .",
    "the spectra in this temperature regime were found to be best fitted , for times @xmath30s , to a function of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the signal from the sample and @xmath33 represents a constant background contribution from those muons that stop in the sample holder or cryostat tail .",
    "the term multiplied by 1/3 accounts for those components of the muon spin that are expected to lie parallel to the local magnetic field at the muon site in a polycrystalline material ( and would therefore not be expected to give rise to an oscillatory signal ) .",
    "the transverse relaxation rate @xmath34 was found to be constant for each temperature @xmath35 and was fixed at a value @xmath36  mhz .",
    "a phase offset of @xmath37 was also required to fit the oscillations , probably arising from the difficulty in exactly identifying @xmath38 in this measurement of a very fast precession signal .",
    "we note that the model that gives rise to equation ( [ fitbi ] ) describes a material that is uniformly magnetically ordered throughout its bulk . in our @xmath14sr measurements we are unable to resolve any signal from a spin - glass - like phase that has recently been proposed to exist below @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the temperature evolution of the frequency , extracted from fits to equation  ( [ fitbi ] ) to the measured data , is shown in figure  [ bian](a ) .",
    "fits to the phenomenological form @xmath39 yield @xmath1  k , @xmath40  mhz , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we note that our value of @xmath43 is consistent with the 3d heisenberg model .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 is smaller than would be expected for ferromagnetic magnons ( for which we expect @xmath45 ) .",
    "these parameters are robust when the fitting range is varied and attempts to fit only the low temperature portion of the data similarly fail to reveal the expected low temperature dependence .",
    "although this may be attributed to the low concentration of data points in the limit @xmath46 , we note that the form for the magnetic contribution to the heat capacity ( @xmath47 ) expected for ferromagnetic magnons was not observed @xcite , which might suggest that the system is not amenable to a simple spin wave analysis .",
    "our estimate of @xmath48 allows us to attempt to determine the muon sites in bimno@xmath0 . the local magnetic field at a muon site * b*@xmath49(*r*@xmath50 ) is usually dominated by the sum of dipolar contributions .",
    "assuming the local field is due entirely to the dipole field of mn@xmath3 ions we may write @xmath51 where * r*@xmath50 is the position of the muon , @xmath52 is the ordered magnetic moment of the @xmath53 mn ion and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) is the unit vector from the muon to the mn ion at site * r*@xmath56 . the positive muon s position is usually in the vicinity of the electronegative o@xmath57 ions @xcite .",
    "dipole fields were calculated in a sphere containing @xmath58 mn ions with moments of 3.8@xmath59 ( that is , the value of the saturation magnetization per mn@xmath3 ion estimated from our magnetization measurements ) aligned along the [ 010 ] direction @xcite",
    ". a magnetic field consistent with @xmath48 is found at several positions in the unit cell . using the @xmath6 space group , candidate muon sites",
    "may be identified at the positions ( 0.40 , 0.52 , 0.26 ) and ( 0.10 , 0.67 , 0.24 ) , placing muons either side of the mn@xmath3 ion located at ( 0.246 0.563 0.243 ) .",
    "application of the symmetry elements of @xmath6 generates crystallographically equivalent sites at which the same local field is experienced .",
    "the result is that the magnetically equivalent candidate muon sites lie close to a mn@xmath3 ion near @xmath60 or @xmath61 , as shown in figure [ muonsite ] , where 8 sites are evident per unit cell .",
    "applying the elements of @xmath6 to either candidate site generates no positions at which a different local magnetic field is found , which is consistent with our observation that there is a unique local field at all muon sites in the ordered regime .",
    "the calculation was checked for several values of mn@xmath3 magnetic moment in the range 3.2@xmath62 to account for the different values of the magnetic moment reported from previous work @xcite . very similar muon sites to those described above were found for all calculations , with the exact positions shifted by a maximum of @xmath63% of the lattice parameters . repeating this procedure using the space group",
    "@xmath13 leads to little difference in the local magnetic field profile . in this case",
    "the muon position is given by ( 0.60 , 0.71 , 0.50 ) . applying the symmetry elements of @xmath13 gives similar muon sites to those described above , placing muons on either side of the mn ions ( 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.5 ) and again leading to 8 magnetically equivalent sites per unit cell .",
    "it should be noted that in a ferromagnet such as bimno@xmath0 we would also expect contributions from the lorentz field , demagnetization field and the hyperfine contact field which may mean that the situation is somewhat more complicated than considered here .    above @xmath64 ,",
    "the spectra are found to be purely relaxing ( figure  [ bidat](b ) ) and are best described with a single exponential function @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a relaxation rate and @xmath32 is constant .",
    "an exponential relaxation is usually indicative of dynamic fluctuations in the local magnetic field at the muon site @xcite . in this case",
    "the relaxation rate may be written as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the second moment of the local magnetic field distribution and @xmath69 is the correlation time .",
    "if the distribution of spin disorder within the system is temperature dependent we would expect a variation in @xmath68 . more often , in the absence of magnetic or structural transitions",
    ", @xmath68 does not have a dramatic temperature variation and it is the fluctuation rate @xmath69 that varies with temperature .",
    "the variation of @xmath66 with temperature is shown in figure  [ bian](b ) where we see a monotonic decrease in @xmath66 with increasing temperature but with a significant change in slope around @xmath70  k. this is indicative of a sharp crossover between regimes of slow dynamics ( large @xmath69 ) below @xmath71 and faster dynamics ( small @xmath69 ) at higher temperatures . a clue to the origin of this behaviour",
    "may be found by comparing @xmath66 to the relaxation at long times ( @xmath72  @xmath19s ) for @xmath73 , corresponding to the relaxation rate @xmath74 in equation  ( [ fitbi ] ) , which also arises due to dynamic relaxation processes .",
    "this is facilitated by increasing the size of the time bins of the data so that the oscillations become unresolvable below @xmath2 as shown in figure [ bidat](b ) .",
    "the results of such an analysis are shown in the inset of figure  [ bian](b ) , where we see that @xmath29 is roughly symmetrical in temperature about @xmath2 , with @xmath69 increasing dramatically for @xmath75  k.    the sharp crossover seen in the dynamic relaxation rates @xmath74 and @xmath66 does not appear to correspond to features in the the bulk properties of bimno@xmath0 .",
    "given the symmetrical nature of the effect about the critical temperature , it seems unlikely that it is related to a structural transition ( causing a change in the second moment of the local field distribution @xmath76 ) of the sort that has been suggested to account for the dielectric anomaly near @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "instead , it is probable that it is a different dynamic relaxation channel that determines the relaxation time @xmath69 on either side of the crossover . in a material where more than one relaxation channel coexists at a particular temperature , only the _ slowest _ ( i.e.  the channel described by the largest relaxation rate @xmath69 ) will dominate the muon - spin relaxation .",
    "this is expected to lead to relaxation with a single relaxation rate @xmath29 as observed in this case .",
    "( in contrast , multiple relaxation rates only coexist in cases where the fluctuations are confined to spatially separate regions @xcite . ) from our observation of a single relaxation rate , we may therefore infer that the fluctuations occur throughout the entire bulk of bimno@xmath0 at all temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the amplitude @xmath32 is constant across the measured temperature range shows that this crossover is intrinsic to the bulk of the material .    at temperatures above @xmath71 dynamic fluctuations of the mn@xmath3 spins",
    "are probable , slowing as the temperature is decreased leading to an increase in @xmath66 .",
    "the nature of the dynamics causing the muon depolarization in this regime is not clear and its temperature dependence does not enjoy a form that may be described by a simple physical model .",
    "as the temperature is decreased below @xmath2 another relaxation process , with a more dramatic temperature dependence , becomes the slowest channel and then dominates the measured relaxation rate @xmath29 .",
    "the symmetrical behaviour of @xmath77 suggests that this process is caused by critical dynamics @xcite in the region @xmath78 ) , where @xmath79 .",
    "dynamic relaxation rates are proportional to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the zero frequency correlation function for wavevector * k * , describing the local fields at the muon site @xcite . calculations of @xmath81 lead us to expect @xmath66 to diverge close to @xmath2 according to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 may be related to the standard critical exponents @xcite via @xmath84 @xcite . for a @xmath85 heisenberg model",
    "we find @xmath86 @xcite , leading to the fit shown in figure  [ bian](b ) for @xmath87 .",
    "this approach describes the data adequately , becoming worse , as should be expected , as we move away from @xmath2 .",
    "finally , as the temperature is lowered below @xmath88 in the ordered regime , residual spin fluctuations become the slowest channel and therefore dominate @xmath74 .",
    "these results suggest that the spin fluctuations in bimno@xmath0 are not trivial .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering measurements may throw further light on the magnetic excitations in this system .",
    "we have carried out a @xmath14sr investigation of the multiferroic material bimno@xmath0 .",
    "our measurements show that the ferromagnetic transition occurs at @xmath1  k with two regimes of dynamics separated by a sharp crossover at @xmath89  k. we have also identified candidate muon sites in the material on the strength of dipole field calculations .",
    "muons have been shown to be a useful and effective probe of magnetism in this system .",
    "the possibility of carrying out future muon studies in the presence of applied electric fields ( for an example see @xcite ) presents opportunities for investigations of the microscopic mechanisms responsible for multiferroic behaviour in this class of materials .",
