    "<S> we demonstrate that the nanoribbon edge creates an effective potential that keeps the carbon structures on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal that the character of the motion of c@xmath0 molecules depends on temperature : for low temperatures ( @xmath1  k ) the main type of motion is sliding along the surface , but for higher temperatures the sliding is replaced by rocking and rolling . </S>",
    "<S> modeling of the buckyball with an included metal ion , such as fe@xmath2@c@xmath0 , demonstrates that this molecular complex undergoes a rolling motion along the nanoribbon with the constant velocity under the action of a constant electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the similar effect is observed in the presence of the heat gradient applied to the nanoribbon , but mobility of carbon structures in this case depends largely on their size and symmetry , such that larger and more asymmetric structures demonstrate much lower mobility . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that both electorphoresis and thermophoresis can be employed to control the motion of carbon molecules and fullerenes and , for example , sort them by their size , shape , and possible inclusions . </S>"
