    "@xmath5 is a complex constant corresponding to four wave mixing and @xmath6 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "besides self phase and cross phase modulation effects , four wave mixing effects have also been included in ( [ cnls01 ] ) . when @xmath7 and @xmath8 the above equation reduces to the manakov system @xcite .",
    "when @xmath9 and @xmath8 it reduces to the mixed coupled nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite . the nonlinear system ( [ cnls01 ] )",
    "has also been proved to be completely integrable for arbitrary values of the system parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 through weiss - tabor - carnevale ( wtc ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "n - bright soliton formula for the system ( [ cnls01 ] ) is constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite . except for the bright n - soliton solution",
    "no other solution is known for this system ( [ cnls01 ] ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive dark solitons and certain rational solutions including rw solutions for the nonlinear evolutionary equation ( [ cnls01 ] ) and analyze how the solution profiles vary with respect to the four wave mixing parameter @xmath5 .",
    "rws ( or freak waves , extreme waves ) are large amplitude ocean waves which are capable of making disastrous effects to oil tanks and cruise ships , which were first considered as mysterious until recorded for the first time by scientific measurements .",
    "consequently the characteristics of the rws have been analyzed in various perspectives , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently rw solutions have been identified in different areas of physics - to name a few we cite the situations in fiber optics @xcite , water tank experiments @xcite , in plasma physics @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite and so on . in particular optical rws",
    "arise due to supercontinuum generation @xcite in optical fibers and they have many potential applications to generate stable , coherent light sources , and to produce high contrast optical switches @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the first and simplest rw solution was reported for the nonlinear schrdinger equation by peregrine @xcite .",
    "this solution approaches a non - zero constant background as time goes to infinity but develops a localized hump with peak amplitude three times the constant background in the intermediate times .",
    "very recently higher order rws were also reported for certain nonlinear evolution equations , see for example refs . .",
    "it has been shown that these higher order rws could reach higher peak amplitudes or exhibit multiple intensity peaks at different spatial locations and times . from the mathematical point of view",
    "these rws can be a limiting case of time periodic breather or ma soliton ( ms ) and space periodic breather or akhmediev breather ( ab ) @xcite .",
    "these breathers arise due to the effect of modulation instability , which is a characteristic feature of a wide class of nonlinear dispersive systems , associated with dynamical growth and evolution of periodic perturbation on a continuous wave background @xcite .",
    "this dynamics is closely related to the celebrated fermi - pasta - ulam recurrence phenomenon , as well as it has potential applications in ultrashort pulse train generation and parametric amplification .",
    "one way of obtaining rw solution or peregrine soliton for a given nonlinear partial differential equation is to construct a breather solution , either ab or ms from the which the rw solution can be deduced in an appropriate limit .",
    "even though rw solutions have been constructed for nonlinear schrdinger equation , derivative nonlinear schrdinger equation and its generalizations and certain multi - component analogues , to our knowledge , rws in coupled nls equation with higher order effects such as four wave mixing effects have not been studied so far .",
    "four wave mixing is a basic nonlinear phenomenon having fundamental relevance and practical applications particularly in nonlinear optics @xcite , optical processing @xcite , phase conjugate optics @xcite , real time holography @xcite and measurement of atomic energy structures and decay rates .",
    "motivated by these considerations and importance of breathers and rws , it is an interesting problem to find how these four wave mixing terms will affect the breather and rw solutions in an associated nonlinear system .",
    "hence , in the present work we construct dark - dark soliton , ab , ms , gb and rw for ( [ cnls01 ] ) .",
    "conventionally these solutions are constructed through darboux transformation method .",
    "differing from this approach we derive all these solutions through hirota s bilinearization method . to begin with , using hirota s method , we construct dark - dark soliton solution for the defocusing cgnls eq .",
    "( [ cnls01 ] ) with the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 replaced by @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) respectively . to construct gb , we bilinearize the focusing cgnls equation ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ cnls01 ] ) ) and construct two soliton solution . by appropriately restricting the parameters which appear in the phase factor we capture the gb , ab , ms and rws .",
    "we then analyze mathematically how these solution profiles change with respect to four wave mixing terms .",
    "as far as the gb profile is concerned our result shows that when we increase the value of the real value of the four wave mixing parameter not only the number of peaks increases but also the direction of the underlying profile gets altered .",
    "as we expect in the ab and ms profiles when we increase the value of @xmath14 @xmath5 only the number of peaks increases . in the case of rw solution",
    "the profile becomes thinner and thinner when we increase the value of @xmath14 @xmath5 .",
    "our studies also reveal that the value of @xmath15 @xmath5 does not change either the number of pulses or the direction of these profiles .",
    "we also analyze the reverse problem of constructing a ab or ms or gb from a rw solution .",
    "to derive them we rewrite the rw solution in a factorized form and generalize this factorized form in an imbricate series expression @xcite with certain unknown parameters in this series .",
    "we then find these unknown parameters by substituting them in eq .",
    "( [ cnls01 ] ) and solving the resultant equations . with three different forms of the imbricate series we derive the ab , ms and gb solutions from the rw solution of ( [ cnls01 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the above , we demonstrate how to derive rw solution directly from ab or ms . to demonstrate this",
    "first we point out that these two profiles strongly depend on a critical parameter . and by making a taylor expansion of these solutions at the critical parameter value we obtain the rw solution .",
    "we also illustrate the isolation of rw from ab and ms pictorially .",

    "since gb solution is periodic in both @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions we need to include two complex arbitrary functions in the imbricate series of rws , which in turn poses mathematical difficulties in transforming these imbricate series into trigonometric and hyperbolic functions .",
    "so it will be very difficult to derive the gb solution from the rw solution in the same procedure as we did in the previous two cases . to overcome this difficulty we adopt the following methodology .    to start with we rewrite the rw solution ( [ pct11 ] ) in the form @xmath215 , @xmath216 , with @xmath217 as given in eq .",

    "differing from the conventional approach we have chosen hirota s method to derive these solutions .",
    "in particular we obtained the two soliton solution using hirota s bilinearization method with a plane wave background . from the two soliton solution",
    "we have deduced the explicit form of gb solution . from the latter",
    "we have derived the ab , ms and rw solutions .",
    "we have also analyzed how these solution profiles vary with respect to the four wave mixing parameter @xmath5 .",

    "it is unclear to us how to construct a bright - dark soliton solution for this equation , which we think is a problem of considerable interest for further investigation .",
    "finally , we also remark that the various solutions discussed in this paper , such as ab , ms and rw have been realized in the context of scalar nls type evolution equations representing wave propagation in optical fibers , bose - einstein condensates , plasma physics , oceanography and so on .",
