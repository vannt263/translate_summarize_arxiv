    "in the current paradigm of the cold dark matter cosmology , the large scale structure of the universe has formed through hierarchical clustering of matter .",
    "deepening of gravitational potential wells caused baryonic matter to accrete onto nonlinear structures .",
    "it was postulated that the baryonic matter behaved like a gas and `` collisionless shocks '' formed in the tenuous , magnetized , cosmic plasma via collective electromagnetic viscosities @xcite .",
    "in fact , the gravitational energy of the baryonic gas associated with structure formation was dissipated into heat primarily via such shocks .",
    "the dissipated energy , then , governs the thermal history and nature of the gas in the universe , and manifests the large scale structure as well as its dynamics through emitted radiation @xcite .    in a recent work ,",
    "@xcite studied the properties of `` cosmological shock waves '' and their roles on thermalization of gas and acceleration of nonthermal particles in the large scale structure , using cosmological n - body / hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the cosmological shocks were classified into two types . ``",
    "external shocks '' form around outermost surfaces that encompass nonlinear structures , so they are by nature accretion shocks that decelerate the never - shocked intergalactic gas infalling toward sheets , filaments and knots .",
    "`` internal shocks '' are produced within those nonlinear structures by infall of previously shocked gas to filaments and knots , during subclump mergers , as well as by chaotic flow motions .",
    "external shocks have high mach numbers of up to @xmath5 due to low temperature of the accreting gas .",
    "internal shocks , on the other hand , have mainly low mach numbers of @xmath6 a few , because the gas inside nonlinear structures has been previously heated by shocks ( external and/or internal ) and so has high temperature . however , internal shocks are more important in energetics , because of higher preshock density . as a result ,",
    "thermalization of gas and acceleration of cosmic rays occurred mostly at internal shocks .",
    "the intergalactic gas was heated mostly by cosmological shock waves .",
    "the shock - heated gas with @xmath1 was studied previously , utilizing cosmological hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "this component , which is called a warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , was estimated to contain @xmath7 of baryon mass at the present epoch and resides mostly in filaments with a median overdensity of @xmath8 .",
    "such whim can count for a significant fraction of the missing baryons at low redshifts @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission from the whim may contribute to a fraction of the soft x - ray background radiation ( xbr ) according to @xcite . while there were recent reports of observations of the whim around clusters ( see ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , detection of such emission still remains a challenging task due to low surface brightness . on the other hand ,",
    "the whim may be better detected through absorption systems and emission lines in soft x - ray and far uv .",
    "for instance , the possibility of probing the whim with ovi absorbers was explored by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "absorption systems due to other oxygen and metal ions in the intervening whim were studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "detections of such absorbers in x - ray observations including chandra were reported ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many ) .",
    "emission lines from metal ions in the whim were studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . a possible detection of such emission lines from a filament around coma was reported @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the shock - heated gas in the large scale structure of the universe and evaluate its observational manifestations with data from a set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations where shock waves were identified ( see * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , the properties of shock - heated gas are analyzed in connection with those of cosmological shock waves . from the shock speed and gas temperature distributions , we see that 1 ) the shocks with @xmath9 and the hot gas with @xmath10 are distributed in and around clusters / groups , 2 ) the shocks with @xmath11 and the whim with @xmath1 are mostly in filamentary structures , and 3 ) the shocks with @xmath3 and the whim with @xmath2 are mostly in sheet - like structures . here",
    "we refer the uncollpased , collisionally ionized , shock - heated gas as the whim and extend the low temperature bound of the whim to well below @xmath12k .",
    "while the whim with @xmath13 k has been studied extensively in many previous works , the `` low temperature whim '' with @xmath14k has not received much attention and will be the main subject of this study .    in the next section ,",
    "simulation data are described along with numerical details .",
    "the properties of shock - heated gas are described in  3 , and its observational manifestations are discussed in  4 .",
    "summary is followed in  5 .",
    "we used the data from a set of n - body / hydrodynamic simulations of a @xmath0cdm universe with radiative cooling .",
    "the simulations were performed using a pm+eulerian hydrodynamic cosmology code that was specifically designed to capture shocks with a high accuracy .",
    "it is an updated version of the code described in @xcite .",
    "for instance , the code now adopts the mc ( monotonized central difference ) limiter , instead of the original minmod limiter to achieve sharper resolution of discontinuities ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the @xmath0cdm model adopted the currently favored values of the following cosmology parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19/(100 km / s / mpc ) = 0.7 , and @xmath20 .",
    "these values are consistent with those fitted with the recent wmap data ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a cubic region of size @xmath21 at present was simulated inside the computational box with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 grid zones for gas and gravity and with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 particles for dark matter , allowing a `` fixed '' spatial resolution of @xmath26 kpc @xmath27 @xmath28 kpc .",
    "we note that the simulations of different resolution have the exactly same large scale structure .",
    "the only difference is the nyquist frequency in the initial condition , apart from spatial and mass resolutions .",
    "we adopted the tabulated cooling rate that had been calculated by following the non - equilibrium collisional ionization of gas with a given metallicity , cooling from @xmath29k to @xmath30 k under the isobaric condition @xcite .",
    "the radiative cooling rate based on equilibrium collisional ionization is not a good approximation for @xmath31 , since recombination lags cooling and so ionization fractions depend on thermal and ionization history of gas .",
    "the non - equilibrium cooling rate for the gas cooling under the isobaric condition , however , becomes a function of temperature only , if the initial temperature is high enough to ensure the initial ionization equilibrium (   @xmath32 ) and if only two - body collisional processes are included ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our simulations ,",
    "gas was allowed to cool only down to @xmath33 and cooling was set equal to zero for @xmath34k . for void gas ,",
    "the minimum temperature was set as the temperature of cosmic microwave background radiation , @xmath35 .",
    "for metallicity , we adopted the mean metallicity - density relation , @xmath36\\right ] , \\label{zmetal}\\ ] ] which had been suggested by @xcite , using the data from a cosmological simulation with feedbacks into the igm from stars .",
    "the simulations are the same ones previously used in @xcite for the study of cosmological shock waves , except radiative cooling is included .",
    "a few points on numerical details are noted .",
    "1 ) our simulations did not include star and galaxy formations and feedbacks from those stars , galaxies and agns , nor photo - ionization heating of the intergalactic gas .",
    "this is because our primary focus is the heating by cosmological shock waves and the properties of shock - heated gas in filaments and sheets .",
    "non - gravitational feedbacks are expected to be most important in high density regions inside clusters and groups . through previous studies by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it is known that the intergalactic gas was heated primarily by cosmological shock waves .",
    "feedbacks may have contributed only @xmath37 or so of the thermal energy of the intergalactic gas , so they should have played only minor roles in the thermal evolution of the whim in filaments and sheets . on the other hand ,",
    "photo - ionization heating should have affected mostly diffuse gas in void regions and ly @xmath38 clouds , heating it to @xmath33 ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "but it should not have affected much the properties of the whim , since most of the whim has @xmath39 in our simulations .",
    "when we estimated the amount of shock - heated gas , we excluded the components that would have been heated primarily by photo - ionization ( see the next section for details ) .",
    "however , the photo - ionization of metal ions , such as oxygen , due to the background radiation was taken into account in post - processing data analyses , since such photo - ionization dominates over collisional ionization for the whim in filaments and sheets .",
    "2 ) because of the fixed - grid - based nature , our data have a limitation in studies of high density regions such as cores of clusters and groups of galaxies , compared to those using sph or amr codes @xcite . however , the same nature of fixed grid - spacing turns out to be an advantage in studying the low density gas in filaments and sheets .",
    "the typical thickness of filaments and sheets is @xmath40 or larger ( see fig . 2 below ) .",
    "in addition , the internal shocks inside those nonlinear structures have a mean separation of @xmath40 too @xcite .",
    "as shown below , numerical resolution is important in studies of the gas inside those nonlinear structures .",
    "the fixed grid - spacing of @xmath26kpc , @xmath41 of those scales , in our highest resolution simulation seems to be good enough to resolve filaments and sheets and shocks in those structures @xcite .",
    "3 ) in order to establish the connection between shock - heated gas and cosmological shocks , we identified shock surfaces by the procedure described in @xcite . only the shocks with @xmath42",
    "were identified , although the code itself captures shocks of any speed .",
    "we begin our discussion with the temperature and density of shock - heated gas in the simulated universe .",
    "figure 1 shows the mass distribution in the plane of gas density and temperature at @xmath43 from different simulations .",
    "the purple line along @xmath44 k in high density regime in the simulations with @xmath22 and @xmath23 grid zones is an artifact of numerical simulation . in order to isolate the shock - heated whim ,",
    "we draw two lines in the figure : 1 ) the straight line represents the `` lyman-@xmath38 equation of state '' of @xcite , @xmath45 which was adjusted for different values of cosmological parameters employed ( see also * ? ? ? * among many references ) .",
    "the line comes from the interplay of radiative heating by the uv background with the expansion of the universe .",
    "the region of overdensity @xmath46 that lies below this line would have been heated primarily by the background uv radiation to the temperature depicted by the line .",
    "2 ) the curved line in the high density regime delineates the `` fast - cooling '' dense region , which was adopted also from @xcite again with a suitable modification due to different values of parameters .",
    "it comes from the equality of the effective cooling time due to radiative cooling plus heating by the background uv radiation and the hubble time .",
    "the high density region ( @xmath47 ) below the lyman-@xmath38 line and right to the fast - cooling line would have been collapsed into objects such as stars and galaxies or would be in the form of bound objects , if resolution were not limited by fixed grid - spacing in our simulations ( see * ? ? ? * for the distribution of gas from an sph simulation ) . since",
    "our focus is on the intergalactic gas that was mainly heated by shock waves , we exclude in our discussion and analyses below the photo - heated gas as well as the gas in collapsed / bound objects .",
    "several points are apparent in figure 1 .",
    "1 ) in addition to the hot component with @xmath48 and the whim with @xmath1 , which were discussed in previous studies of shock - heated gas @xcite , there exists a significant amount of low temperature whim in the range of @xmath49 .",
    "the mass fraction of the gas in each component is the followings : the hot component @xmath50 , the whim with @xmath1 @xmath51 and the the whim with @xmath49 @xmath52 in our highest resolution simulation data ( see table 1 ) . in the hot component , the gas within 1 @xmath53mpc of clusters / groups hotter than 1kev was not included .",
    "most of the low temperature whim has the temperature of @xmath54 , while the mass of the whim with @xmath55 is @xmath56 of total gas mass .",
    "2 ) our estimate of mass fraction for the whim with @xmath1 is comparable to , although a little smaller than , @xmath7 from simulations using the ptreesph and amr codes @xcite .",
    "a part of the difference would be due to feedbacks from stars , galaxies , and agns , which were ignored in our simulations .",
    "3 ) it is interesting to note that the distribution of our whim follows very closely the `` equation of state for the warm igm '' , analytically suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , their estimation of mass fraction for the `` warm igm '' , @xmath51 , is somewhat smaller than our estimation for all the whim with @xmath57 .",
    "4 ) gas density reaches to higher values and cooling becomes even more efficient with the @xmath58 dependence at higher resolution .",
    "the resulting trend is that there is more gas with high density and low temperature in higher resolution simulations . as a result",
    ", the mass fraction of the whim continues to decrease as resolution increases in our simulations ( see table 1 ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the spatial distribution of shock - heated gas in conjunction with that of shock waves themselves .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , two types of shocks can be distinguished .",
    "`` external shocks '' are accretion shocks around nonlinear structures , whose speed is basically the infall velocity of accreting flows .",
    "`` internal shocks '' are products of infall , merging , and chaotic flow motions induced by gravitational interactions inside nonlinear structures .",
    "so the shock speed of both types should reflect the depth of gravitational potential wells of nonlinear structures , and hence their morphology .",
    "in our simulations , 1 ) high - speed shocks with @xmath9 are found mostly around and inside knot - like structures of clusters / groups , 2 ) shocks with @xmath59 mostly around and inside filamentary structures , and 3 ) low - speed shocks with @xmath3 mostly around and inside sheet - like structures .",
    "the left panels of figure 2 show the locations of external shocks , divided into the three speed groups , in a two - dimensional slice at @xmath43 from the @xmath22 simulation .",
    "the shocks encompass and outline nonlinear structures .",
    "the structures with width of @xmath40 in the top - left panel are mostly sheet - like structures with shallow potentials , while the thicker structures with width of @xmath60 in the mid - left panel are filaments ( see also fig . 3 below ) .",
    "the structure in the bottom - left panel contains a cluster with x - ray emission - weighted temperature , @xmath61 kev , and x - ray luminosity , @xmath62 erg s@xmath63 ( note this cluster has a high luminosity for its temperature due to excessive cooling without feedbacks from stars and galaxies ) .    the morphological distinction can be revealed more clearly in three - dimensional volume renderings for the distribution of shocks waves . the image in figure 3(a )",
    "displays all shocks ( external and internal ) inside the full box of ( 100 @xmath64)@xmath65 . at a quick glance ,",
    "filamentary structures look dominant .",
    "however , a careful inspection , especially near the edges of the box where structures do not overlap , exhibits lots of of sheet - like structures . in order to take a close look at sheet - like structures , we show in figures 3(c ) and ( d ) the distribution of low speed shocks with @xmath66 in a region of ( 25 @xmath64)@xmath65 , which is marked in the top - left panel of figure 2 . for filamentary structures we show in figures 3(e ) and ( f ) the distribution of shocks with @xmath67 in a region of ( 31 @xmath64)@xmath65 , which is marked in the mid - left panel of figure 2 . for further reference , volume rendering movies for shocks of different speed groups in the two regions shown in figure 3(c ) to ( f ) as well as in the region covering the complex in the bottom - left panel of figure 2",
    "are posted at `` http://canopus.chungnam.ac.kr/ryu/shock.html '' . the figures ( along with the movies )",
    "demonstrate that the morphology of nonlinear structures can be revealed through the distributions of shocks of the three speed groups .",
    "naturally , it is expected that the spatial distribution of shock - heated gas is closely related to that of cosmological shock waves .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows a three - dimensional volume rendering image for the temperature of shock - heated gas in the same perspective as that of figure 3(a ) .",
    "the images confirms that the two distributions are indeed very similar .",
    "the right panels of figure 2 show the gas distribution in three temperature ranges , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath48 , in the same two - dimensional slice as in the left panels . with the choice of temperature ranges , different morphology defined by shock waves",
    "is revealed once again by gas temperature too : the hot component mostly in knot - like structures , the whim with @xmath1 mostly in filaments , and the low temperature whim with @xmath2 mostly in sheet - like structures .",
    "hence our results suggest the existence of a component of the intergalactic gas , the low temperature whim with @xmath2 , that has not been explored in details in previous studies .",
    "as noted in the introduction , it was suggested that the x - ray emission from the whim may contribute significantly to the soft xbr .",
    "@xcite estimated that the emission would contribute @xmath70 of the observed xbr in the @xmath71 kev range .",
    "they used @xmath0cdm simulation data in which radiative cooling , feedbacks from galaxies and photo - ionization were included , and @xmath23 grid zones were used for the box of @xmath72 size . on the other hand , based on analyses of observational data , @xcite suggested that most of the soft xbr could come from the whim . in order to asses how numerical details including finite resolution would affect the prediction , we calculated the x - ray emission from the shock - heated gas outside clusters / groups using our simulation data with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 grid zones .",
    "similarly as @xcite , the gas in spherical regions of @xmath73 radius around clusters / groups with @xmath74 kev was excluded , since they would be identified as discrete x - ray sources and be removed from contributors to the background radiation . also the gas below the lyman-@xmath38 and fast - cooling lines in figure 1 was excluded .",
    "the x - ray spectrum code for an optically thin gas , mekal @xcite , was used to calculate the mean proper volume emissivity , @xmath75 , from the entire simulation box at @xmath76 , 1.5 , 1 , 0.5 , 0.2 , and 0 .",
    "the mean background intensity at @xmath43 , @xmath77 , was calculated then by integrating @xmath75 from @xmath76 to @xmath43 .",
    "also the energy flux , @xmath78 , in the x - ray band of @xmath71 kev from the gas with temperature between @xmath79 and @xmath80 was calculated from the proper volume emissivity , @xmath81 , as in the calculation of @xmath77 .",
    "the upper and lower panels of figure 4 show @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , from the simulation data of different resolution .",
    "two points are noticed in figure 4 .",
    "1 ) from the bottom panel , we confirm that among the shock - heated gas , it is the whim with @xmath82 @xmath83 that contributes most to the soft xbr .",
    "2 ) the amount of x - ray emission increases with resolution , although the amount of shock - heated gas that emits such radiation decreases ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is because there is systematically more gas with higher density in higher resolution simulations .",
    "the x - ray emission in our two high resolution simulation ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) differs by only a factor of two or so in @xmath84 kev .",
    "the fractional contribution to the observed xbr ( see * ? ? ? * for discussions on observations ) is largest in the @xmath85 kev range , and estimated to be @xmath7 in the @xmath22 simulation and @xmath86 in the @xmath23 simulation .",
    "our estimation from the @xmath23 simulation is comparable to , although a little larger than , @xmath70 of @xcite , which has the same spatial resolution .",
    "although our simulations and that in @xcite were performed with the same numerical code , different treatments of additional physical processes as well as details of numerical schemes should have led to the difference . however , our estimation from the highest resolution simulation with @xmath22 grid zones is @xmath87 times larger than theirs , indicating that the whim could be a major contributor to the soft xbr .",
    "it was suggested that the properties of the shock - heated gas in filaments and sheets may be studied best by analyzing the soft x - ray and far uv `` absorption systems '' or `` x - ray forests '' in the spectra of distance quasars and agns .",
    "especially , the ovi absorption systems in far uv and the ovii and oviii absorption systems in soft x - ray were studied extensively by several authors ( see  1 for references ) .",
    "we also study the properties of such absorbers in our simulated local universe at @xmath43 , following the procedure described below .",
    "first , we constructed a table for the fractions of oxygen ions as a function of gas temperature and density . since photo - ionization of oxygen ions is important for the low density gas in filaments / sheets ,",
    "the x - ray background radiation of @xcite and the uv background radiation of @xcite were included , following @xcite .",
    "the photo - ionization code , cloudy @xcite , was used to compute the fractions of oxygen ions in a grid of temperature and density .",
    "figure 5 shows the resulting fractions of oxygen ions at hydrogen number density @xmath88 as a function of temperature . for comparison , the fractions when no ionizing background radiation presents are also shown .",
    "it is obvious that the photo - ionization of oxygen ions by the adopted background radiations is very significant in the temperature range that corresponds to filaments and sheets ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the most noticeable point is that , with the ionizing background radiations , the fractions of highly ionized oxygen ions increase at lower density . according to figure 1 the whim",
    "have the hydrogen number density , @xmath89 , so the fractions of ovi , ovii and oviii ions are highest in those components .",
    "this is one of the reasons why these oxygen ions were studied extensively in previous works .",
    "next we calculated the column density distributions of absorption systems due to these oxygen ions . in simulation data , clouds of shock - heated gas were identified along the @xmath90 ( @xmath91 the number of grid zones in one - direction ) line paths of @xmath21 at @xmath43 .",
    "again the gas in spherical regions of @xmath73 radius around clusters / groups with @xmath74 kev as well as the gas below the lyman-@xmath38 and fast - cooling lines were excluded .",
    "the metallicity was assigned at each grid zone according to equation ( [ zmetal ] ) .",
    "the left panels of figure 6 show the cumulative distributions of absorption system column density for ov - oviii ions : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of absorption lines with column density , @xmath94 , greater than given values .",
    "as expected from figure 5 , the ovii and oviii absorption systems are strongest . in the @xmath22 simulation data ,",
    "@xmath95 for both @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which is in a good agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the column densities of ov and ovi ions are smaller , so @xmath95 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we note the column density distributions in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 simulation data are converged within a factor of two .",
    "the right panels of figure 6 show the mass fractions of ov - oviii ions due to the gas with temperature between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath100 which was normalized with the total oxygen mass @xmath101 .",
    "we find that the whim with @xmath1 contributes to most of the absorption systems of ovii ( @xmath102 ) and oviii ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "hence the observations of those absorption systems would explore filamentary structures , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "however , the low temperature whim with @xmath2 is the major contributor to the ov and ovi absorption systems , accounting for @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of the low temperature whim in some observations , as noted by @xcite in the study of ovi systems in a quasar spectrum .",
    "observations of emission lines from the shock - heated gas in filaments and sheets still remain technically challenging .",
    "however , it was suggested that detections of such emissions could be possible in future x - ray missions such as mbe ( see http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/baryons/ ) and dios @xcite . in this subsection ,",
    "we study the oxygen emission lines radiated by the whim in our simulation data .",
    "first , a table for the emissivity of oiii ( 698  ) , oiv ( 549  ) , ov ( 630  ) , ovi ( 1032  ) , ovii ( 574 ev ) , and oviii ( 653 ev ) lines was constructed on a grid of gas temperature and density , using cloudy @xcite .",
    "collisional ionization as well as photo - ionization due to the uv and x - ray background radiations described in  4.2 were included .",
    "figure 7 shows the resulting emissivity from the optically thin gas of hydrogen number density @xmath88 . for comparison , the emissivity when",
    "no ionizing background radiation presents is also shown . from this figure",
    "one can expect that for @xmath106 the strongest lines from the gas with @xmath89 in filaments and sheets ( see fig .",
    "1 ) would be the ovii and oviii lines . however , for @xmath107 , ov and ovi would produce emission lines stronger than ovii and oviii lines .    using the emissivity table ,",
    "the oxygen line emissivity from the gas in simulation data was calculated at @xmath43 . as in the calculation of absorption column density ,",
    "only the shock - heated gas was included and the same metallicity - density relation was adopted .",
    "the left panels of figure 8 show the mean emissivity , @xmath108 , of ov - oviii lines from the gas with temperature between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "overall the strength is greatest for the ov and ovi lines , followed by the ovii and oviii lines .",
    "while virtually all emissions of the ovii and oviii lines come from the higher temperature whim with @xmath109 ( @xmath110 for both lines ) , the ov and ovi lines are emitted mostly from the whim with @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "contrary to the ov and ovi absorptions which get significant contributions from the whim with @xmath2 , the line emissions of ov ( 540  ) and ovi ( 1032  ) come mostly from the whim with @xmath113 .",
    "our estimates of line emissions are converged again within a factor of two in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 simulation data .",
    "our results indicate that the exploration of shock - heated gas through emissions in soft x - ray , such as the mbe and dios missions , would pick up a fraction of the whim with @xmath114 ( @xmath70 of total gas mass in our estimate ) , missing the lower temperature whim with @xmath115 .",
    "a search mission using the ov and ovi line emissions in far uv would detect a larger fraction of the low temperature whim with @xmath116 ( @xmath117 of total gas mass ) , complementing the proposed missions in the soft x - ray band .",
    "we also calculated the specific intensity of oxygen lines , @xmath118 , by integrating the emissivity/@xmath119 along columns of @xmath72 at @xmath43 .",
    "note that the hubble expansion speed over the scale of @xmath72 is @xmath120 , and the angular size of a single grid of @xmath121 at a distance of @xmath21 is @xmath122 radian .",
    "so @xmath118 corresponds effectively to the intensity measured over a band of width @xmath123 with a beam of solid angle @xmath124 or smaller , when computed with the @xmath22 simulation data .",
    "we integrated along @xmath90 different line paths in the simulation box .",
    "the right panels of figure 8 show the cumulative fraction of line paths with @xmath118 larger than given values .",
    "they show that the fraction of randomly - chosen line paths with @xmath125 erg @xmath126 s@xmath63 sr@xmath63 would be @xmath127 for the ov and ovi lines , while it would be @xmath128 for the ovii and oviii lines",
    ". however , the fractions of @xmath129 erg @xmath126 s@xmath63 sr@xmath63 are @xmath130 for the ovii and oviii lines and larger than those for the ov and ovi lines .",
    "this reflects the fact that while the ov and ovi lines are stronger overall , the ovii and oviii lines are from the whim with @xmath32 and density higher than the mean density of shock - heated gas .",
    "hierarchical clustering induces cosmological shock waves in the course of large scale structure formation in the universe @xcite .",
    "the intergalactic gas was heated mostly by such shocks @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we studied the properties , spatial distribution , and possible observational manifestations of the shock - heated gas in filaments and sheets with a set of simulation data of a @xmath0cdm universe from a grid - based n - body / hydrodynamic code @xcite .",
    "the nature of fixed grid - spacing makes such data suitable to the study of the shock - heated gas in filaments and sheets .",
    "shock - heating was focused , so feedbacks from stars , galaxies and agns , and photo - ionization heating were ignored , although the photo - ionization of metal ions by the background radiation were taken into account in post - processing data analyses .",
    "we expect that exclusion of such processes should not have weakened significantly the main results of this work , since the gas in filaments and sheets was heated mostly by cosmological shocks .",

    "we saw that 1 ) the shocks with @xmath9 are distributed mostly around and inside clusters / groups , 2 ) the shocks with @xmath131 are mostly around and inside filamentary structures , and 3 ) the shocks with @xmath3 are mostly around and inside sheet - like structures .",
    "the distribution of the shock - heated gas should be closely related to that of shock waves .",
    "we found that the whim with @xmath1 is distributed mostly in filamentary structures , while the low temperature whim with @xmath132k is mostly in sheet - like structures .",
    "the hot gas with @xmath133k resides on knot - like structures as the intra - cluster / intra - group medium and the low density medium around them .",
    "the amount of shock - heated gas was estimated as follows : the hot component with @xmath48 ( excluding the gas inside clusters / groups ) accounts for @xmath134 of total gas mass , the whim with @xmath1 for @xmath135 , and the whim with @xmath49 for @xmath136 in our highest resolution simulation .",
    "thus our results indicate the existence of the whim with @xmath49 , which was heated by shocks of low speed with @xmath3 and is distributed as sheet - like structures .",
    "we suggest that _ the low temperature whim with @xmath49 contributes to a significant fraction of the missing baryons at low redshifts _",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested in previous studies ( see  1 for references ) that the shock - heated gas in filaments and sheets can be manifested through emissions and absorptions in soft x - ray and far uv .",
    "1 ) we found that the soft x - ray emission from the shock - heated gas in our highest resolution data contributes to @xmath7 of the observed xbr in the @xmath85 kev range .",
    "this is somewhat larger than that previously suggested by @xcite .",
    "2 ) column densities of oxygen ions along randomly selected line paths in the computational box were calculated .",
    "such column densities can produce the absorption systems or x - ray forests in the spectra of distant quasars and agns ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the photo - ionization of oxygen ions by the background uv and x - ray radiations is important for the gas in filaments and sheets due to low density and temperature . as a result",
    ", the fractions of oxygen ions depend strongly on the local gas density .",
    "we found that , for ovii and oviii , the absorption systems associated with the whim with @xmath1 account for @xmath137 of the identified absorption systems , while the low temperature whim with @xmath2 contributes @xmath138 of the ovi and ov absorption systems .",
    "3 ) finally , the emission lines from oxygen ions were calculated .",
    "they are emitted mostly from collisionally excited ions .",
    "we estimated that @xmath110 of the ovii line ( 574 ev ) and oviii line ( 653 ev ) emissions come from the whim with @xmath109 , while @xmath112 of the ovi line ( 1032  ) and @xmath103 of the ov line ( 630  ) are emitted by the whim with @xmath111 .",
    "hence , we conclude that _ absorption systems in uv due to species such as ov and ovi provide the best chance to detect the low temperature whim with @xmath2 .",
