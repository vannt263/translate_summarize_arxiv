    "the presence of ultraviolet ( uv ) ( especially far - uv [ @xcite ] ) flux from the m33 nucleus , and its small size , imply a coeval , young stellar population .",
    "the flat uv / optical spectrum of the m33 nucleus [ figure  1c of mcquade , calzetti , & kinney ( 1995 ) ] , when coupled with the assumption of a single young stellar population , can only be explained by significant reddening by dust internal to m33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the work of witt , thronson , & capuano ( 1992 ) demonstrates the importance of accurately treating the radiative transfer through the dust in galaxies .",
    "the m33 nucleus is ideal for investigating the role of dust in starburst galaxies .",
    "previous work on starburst galaxies found that the extinction curve lacks a 2175    bump ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the only other dust which does not have a 2175  bump is found in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "gordon & clayton ( 1998 ) reinvestigated the uv extinction in the smc and found evidence to support the processing of dust near sites of active star formation .",
    "dust with weak 2175    bumps is seen along some galactic and large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) sightlines ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the lack of a 2175    bump is the result of processing the dust near sites of active star formation .",
    "the work of gordon et al .",
    "( 1997 ) was based on an iue selected sample of starburst galaxies and due to the large aperture of iue , the sample was observationally biased toward intrinsically bright starbursts with small amounts of dust .",

    "we find that its dust has a strong 2175  bump , in contrast to the behavior of the starburst dust studied previously ( @xcite ) .",

    "the indication of a young , very compact , and moderate luminosity starburst in the central pc of m33 is interesting because of the possible similarity to the very young and massive stars within the central 0.5 pc of the milky way . because of their modest outputs and small sizes",
    ", such systems would not stand out clearly in the nuclei of galaxies outside the local group .",
    "the presence of two similar events in local group galaxies suggests that such starbursts may be relatively common and hence may play an important role in the evolution of the central parsec - sized regions of galaxies .",

    "the background level is determined using an annulus surrounding the nucleus . as a result",
    ", the photometry of the m33 nucleus does not include a significant contribution from the disk or bulge of m33 .",
    "the background levels for spectroscopic observations are usually measured a significant distance from the nucleus .",
    "this means they include contributions from regions surrounding the nucleus , which makes studying just the nucleus difficult .",
    "thus , to isolate the spectral behavior of the nucleus requires a judicious combination of both photometry and spectroscopy .",

    "in addition , the use of relatively large apertures results in the flux from the nucleus being diluted by flux from the surrounding region .",

    "the iue spectrum obviously includes flux from both the nucleus and the surrounding region since the photometric sed is always below the iue spectrum .",
    "the shape of the iue spectrum is flatter than the photometric and model seds , implying that the uv spectrum of the region surrounding the nucleus has a much smaller depression at 2175    and , therefore , is attenuated by less dust than the nucleus .",

    "both the differing line strengths and the bluer color could arise from inclusion of flux from the region surrounding the nucleus as the observed spectrum includes light from a @xmath120 region .",
    "the general agreement with the nuclear photometric levels would still be consistent if some of the nuclear flux spilled out of the slit ( the seeing was @xmath2@xmath56 ) .",

    "since the inputs to the infrared models have greater uncertainty and are less complete than those for the optical , it is not surprising that this is also the region where the models are most deviant .",

    "the presence of an older ( @xmath21 gyr ) underlying stellar population with a large @xmath111 is strongly implied by the growth of surface brightness and stellar counts approaching the nuclear region ( @xcite ) and the mass ( @xmath142 ) of the inner @xmath32 of m33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "within 4@xmath45 , 3/4 of the observed v band flux comes from the nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the other stellar population in the nuclear region has a @xmath111 ratio of 5.5 assuming the set a best fits or 1.8 assuming the set b best fit .",
    "thus , the mass required by the set a models ( @xmath143 ) is more consistant with the available data on the nuclear region .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic evidence indicate that set a models fit the observations of the m33 nucleus better than the set b models , as does the mass determination .",
    "the set a models are consistent with the small size of the nucleus and flat profile of the inner disk of m33 .",
    "the flat profile implies there is a lack of a substantial density gradient which could funnel gas to the nucleus ( @xcite ) , which means fueling continuous star formation ( as set b fits would require ) would be difficult .",
    "the stellar population of the m33 nucleus is described by a 35 to 180 myr burst of star formation with a mass of 0.4 - 1.1  @xmath144 ( table  [ tab_best_fit ] ) .",
    "the best fit seds in set a for both ses models give very similar results .",
    "they imply the best description of the m33 nucleus is a burst of star formation 70 - 75 myrs old and a mass of @xmath20.7  @xmath144 ( table  [ tab_best_fit ] ) .",
    "our finding that the m33 nucleus is well described by a single burst of star formation enshrouded by a significant amount of dust is quite different than previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these studies ,",
    "the role of dust was underestimated and , as a result , luminous young and old stellar populations were both needed to reproduce the relatively red ( flat ) spectrum of the m33 nucleus . for example , ciani et al .",
    "( 1984 ) modeled the iue spectrum plus @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 photometry of the m33 nucleus .",
    "they found that the data were best represented by two stellar populations , one extremely young ( @xmath148 years ) and one old ( @xmath149 years ) .",
    "they argued that the effects of foreground and internal dust were well represented by a screen of mw - type dust with an @xmath150 .",
    "schmidt et al .  ( 1990 ) obtained a long - slit optical spectrum of the m33 nucleus with a @xmath151 slit and modeled it using a combination of star clusters of different ages .",
    "they found that the m33 nucleus was composed of 7 star clusters with ages ranging from @xmath152 to @xmath153 years .",
    "this is similar to other studies where over 50% of the v band light was claimed to be from stars with ages @xmath154 years .",
    "in addition , schmidt et al.(1990 ) modeled the effects of dust as due to a galactic foreground screen with @xmath155 and a m33 internal screen with @xmath156 .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath111 ) we compute from our model fits , corrected for foreground and internal dust , is @xmath20.1 .",
    "this is significantly different from previous studies , which found @xmath157 23 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) which is in excess of the value likely to be present from dynamical considerations . by including dust properly ,",
    "we have arrived at a simpler model of the m33 nucleus which reproduces its observed sed from the uv to the near - ir .",
    "we can estimate the peak luminosity of the m33 starburst , although there is some uncertainty because our models do not constrain the rate of star formation with time uniquely .",
    "for example , the starburst mass in m33 is roughly 500 times less than that in m82 , assuming similar imfs ( e.g. , imf8 of @xcite ) and the somewhat extended burst which best fits the m82 data .",
    "thus , at an age of @xmath210 million years , the m33 starburst would have luminosity of 0.002 times that of m82 , or @xmath158 , alternately , from our abrupt burst model and the current luminosity of @xmath159 , the luminosity at 10 myrs would have been @xmath160 .",
    "the center of the milky way contains a very compact ( @xmath161 pc ) cluster of young ( @xmath162 myrs old ) stars with an integrated luminosity of @xmath2@xmath163 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the analogy between these two cases is striking .",
    "it appears that in m33 we may well be seeing a later development of an event virtually identical to the starburst that currently dominates the galactic center .",
    "the relatively young age of the nucleus that we derive from our models may clear up another mystery .",
    "the m33 nucleus has a very strong x - ray source with a @xmath164 ergs s@xmath47 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of a 106 day period requires that this object be a single source ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only known type of object which could reproduce both observed effects is a stellar mass black hole ( @xmath2@xmath165 ) accreting from a companion star .",
    "this type of object was mentioned by dubus et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , but discarded as the solution as previous work on the m33 nucleus argued against a significant population of o  b stars .",
    "the requirements of such an x - ray binary are a black hole with a companion star with enough mass to withstand the supernova blast that created the black hole without being ejected from the binary .",
    "for example , a black hole with an early b giant companion would be transfering a significant amount of matter to the black hole , resulting in the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the type , geometry , and amount of dust associated with the m33 nucleus is fairly well constrained by the observed photometric sed .",
    "the dust is best described by a shell of somewhat clumpy mw - like dust ( @xmath166 ) with a radial v - band optical depth of @xmath22 . to show the effects of both foreground and internal dust on the intrinsic sed of the m33 nucleus , we present figure  [ fig_dust_ex ] . even in the galactic foreground dust corrected sed , the flux at 2607    ( uit - a1 ) is significantly lower than the flux in the bands around 1600    ( uit - b1 , f160bw , and f170w ) and around 3300    ( f300w , f336w , u ) . the only known way to get",
    "such a depression in the sed of a stellar population is to attenuate its sed by dust with a 2175    feature , i.e.  mw - type dust .",
    "it is interesting to compare this with the result found by gordon e al .",
    "they found that smc - like dust was responsible for the attenuation in the 30 starburst galaxies in their sample .",
    "they used iue - selected starburst galaxies , which biased their study towards intrinsically bright , lightly attenuated starburst regions .",
    "the interstellar environment near an intense starburst is very harsh , associated with an intense uv radiation density and supernovae shocks .",
    "there is evidence from the observed dust extinction curves in the magellanic clouds which suggests that star formation modifies nearby dust . in the smc , the only extinction curve outside the star forming bar is very similar to that found in the milky way .",
    "the other three extinction curves in the bar are the most extreme known in terms of a non - existent 2175    bump and strong far - uv rise ( @xcite ) . in the lmc , there are two different extinction curves ( @xcite ) . the extinction curve associated with stars near the lmc 2 supergiant shell ( which is itself near the 30 dor star formation region ) has a weak 2175    bump .",
    "the extinction curve associated with stars elsewhere in the lmc is similar to that found in the milky way .",
    "however , the 30 dor region in the lmc exhibits much more intense star formation than any region in the smc , but the most extreme extinction curves are found in the smc .",
    "this fact implies that the relationship between star formation activity and the modification of nearby dust is not a simple one .",
    "recent theoretical models of dust exposed to shocks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) illustrate the complicated behavior expected for dust near active star formation .",
    "the number of small particles in shocked dust is increased through shattering of larger grains and results in an increased extinction in the far - uv .",
    "however , the models which produce a stronger far - uv rise , also produce normal or strong 2175    bumps .",
    "this is not what is seen in the behavior of dust in starburst galaxies or the magellanic clouds and probably reflects our incomplete understanding of the carrier of the 2175    feature .",
    "the m33 nucleus was also observed by iue , but is not typical of the iue sample used by gordon et al .",
    "m33 is much closer than the majority of the iue sample ( 0.795 versus 60 mpc ) and its faintness implies it is intrinsically fainter and/or suffers a higher attenuation than the rest of the sample . in the case of m33 , the starburst is surrounded by a larger optical depth of dust and , since it lacks emission lines , is older than those seen in the iue sample .",
    "thus , the dust in the m33 nucleus has likely undergone less processing since it is near a small starburst and self - shielded by a large amount of dust .",
    "the amount by which dust can be processed in starburst regions is likely related to the mass and age of the starburst as well as the extent to which the dust can shield itself .",
    "additional work on other fairly reddened starburst regions is needed to test this interpretation of the origin of the mw - type dust we find in the m33 nucleus .",
    "the low velocity dispersion and extreme compactness of the m33 nucleus have caused lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to suggest that stellar mergers might play an important role in creating the blue stellar population ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these arguments are based on a calculation that a typical star lying within the present - day environment of the m33 nucleus would have a collision / binary capture timescale of about a hubble time .",
    "this model could apply if the previous estimate of an old ( @xmath167 yr ) stellar population in the nucleus of m33 is assumed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "that is , if conditions in the nucleus have not changed over a hubble time , most stars in the nucleus will have undergone such an event . to assess",
    "if collisions and mergers are important , we will assume the age of the nucleus is on the order of the hubble time and see if reasonable arguments lead to the observed characteristics of the m33 nucleus .",
    "the optical spectrum of m33 ( figure  [ fig_id_opt ] ) demonstrates that the nucleus contains many stars of @xmath168 .",
    "the observed nuclear b magnitude is 14.6 .",
    "corrected for foreground and internal dust , the intrinsic b magnitude is 12.5 , corresponding to a m@xmath169 ( for a distance of 795 kpc ) . for the purposes of this exercise , we attribute most of the nuclear mass of @xmath170 to an old stellar population that creates more massive stars by mergers",
    ". the absolute blue magnitude would require the presence of @xmath171 main sequence stars with masses @xmath23 @xmath172 , if these stars were the most massive in the nucleus .",
    "this hypothetical population accounts for an uncomfortably large portion of the total nuclear mass . instead , it seems required that the light from the nucleus is dominated by stars closer to the top of the permitted mass range ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "we assume the old stellar population is described by an imf similar to the one taken for the starburst , up to a main sequence turnoff mass of @xmath174 . allowing for the mass lost in mergers , stars at the turnoff must undergo on the order of six to eight mergers to build a @xmath175 star .",
    "thus , the calculation by lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that , on average , each star might undergo one merger in a hubble time implies that the dominant stars could not be created in this fashion .",
    "a more rigorous argument would account for the dynamical evolution of the nucleus . if the age of the m33 nucleus is on the order of the hubble time , then it is possible that it has gone through core collapse ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "lee ( 1987 ) has studied stellar mergers in dynamical models of systems of @xmath176 stars which , in their post core collapse configuration , resemble the m33 nucleus .",
    "the merger rate reaches a sharp peak around core collapse .",
    "stars that are the result of eight mergers , as required to build the blue stars in the m33 nucleus , are @xmath177 less common than the original population members shortly after core collapse in lee s ( 1987 ) model .",
    "we have roughly corrected this result for the approximately three times higher number of seed stars in m33 compared with the modeled cluster .",
    "in addition , lee ( 1987 ) made the optimistic assumptions that all binary captures lead to mergers ( rather than the expected @xmath225% ; @xcite ) and that the merged stars have main sequence lifetimes similar to normal stars ( whereas the lifetimes are shortened considerably by the presence of enriched nuclear material ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we project that mergers would yield at best an order of magnitude less than the numbers of massive stars required .",
    "this conclusion agrees with the statement by hernquist et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .",
    "the merger hypothesis is attractive primarily because of the very small observed core radius in m33 .",
    "however , the observations are dominated by the relatively massive stars ; hence we have to examine the time scale for mass segregation to be sure that the radius measured is representative of the distribution of lower mass stars that hypothetically merge due to their high density in this core .",
    "we have estimated the dynamical decay time for stars of @xmath178 in a total mass of @xmath179 distributed over a radius of 0.5 pc , assuming that the density goes as @xmath180 , @xmath181 , or is constant within this radius .",
    "the calculations are based on equation ( 7 - 18 ) of binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) . we find that the dynamical decay time from formation at a radius of 0.5 pc is in all three cases substantially less than the lifetimes of the stars ; that is , mass segregation is likely to have occurred . the increasing size of the nucleus with wavelength ( see table  [ tab_nuc_size ] ) and",
    "corresponding observed color gradients ( @xcite ; @xcite ) confirm that the blue , massive stars have probably sunk to the center and are surrounded by a population of lower mass stars .",
    "thus , estimates of the merger rate based on the small observed core radius ( e.g. , @xcite and our discussion in the preceding paragraphs ) are likely to be too high .",
    "the merger hypothesis can also be tested by examining the properties of the merger products .",
    "these products have huge angular momentum compared with normal stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the interiors become convective , the resulting high rotation rates may be spun down through magnetic interaction with circumstellar disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the resulting mixing of metal rich material causes the evolution of the stars to differ significantly from that of normal stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of abnormal stellar evolution is made very unlikely by the success in our spectral synthesis evolutionary models in fitting the properties of the nucleus across the entire spectrum , since these models assume normal evolution .",
    "the possibility that the nuclear population is characterized by abnormally high rotational velocities is contradicted by the small net velocity dispersion .",
    "if the merger mechanism played an important role in m33 , then the conclusions drawn from starburst models would largely be vitiated .",
    "however , a variety of arguments show that mergers play a negligible role and hence that the blue stellar population must arise in a starburst as described in section [ sec_stell_pop ] .",
    "by fitting the uv to near - ir sed of the m33 nucleus with a starburst model which includes stars , gas , and dust , we find the m33 nucleus to be composed of a @xmath270 myr burst of star formation with a mass of @xmath2@xmath182 enshrouded by a shell of mw - type dust ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this result is different from previous work which modeled the nucleus using both young ( @xmath6 years ) and old ( @xmath183 years ) stellar populations subject only to modest reddening . by including the effects of dust internal to m33 , we are able to reproduce the relatively red sed of the m33 nucleus without requiring a luminous old stellar population . as a result ,",
    "this work is more consistent with the small size and the detection of far - uv flux from the nucleus .",
    "the dust in m33 has a strong 2175    bump , in contrast to other uv - bright starbursts that do not show this feature .",
    "not much can be said with a sample of one galaxy , but it is possible that the different dust characteristics in m33 nucleus are related to the higher optical depth of dust and/or the age of the starburst .",
    "thus , there is not a single type of dust found in starburst galaxies but a range of types varying from that found in the mw to the smc .",
    "correcting for the effects of dust in starburst galaxies must be done with care , especially in the uv .",
    "the m33 nuclear starburst resembles the ultracompact population of very massive and luminous stars in the center of the milky way , both in the peak luminosity deduced for the starbursts responsible and in the size of the starburst region .",
    "it seems likely that ultracompact starbursts ( @xmath184 pc ) are common in the nuclei of normal galaxies and may influence the evolution of these regions significantly .",
    "confirmation of our interpretation of the m33 nucleus would be greatly helped by additional uv and far - ir observations .",
    "a good uv spectrum of just the nucleus would be easily obtained by the stis instrument on hst due to it s high sensitivity and small apertures .",
    "far - ir observations at high spatial resolution would help put stringent constraints on the mass of the dust internal to the nucleus .",
    "these observations should be possible with sirtf .",

    "<S> we have thoroughly characterized the ultraviolet to near - infrared ( 0.15 - 2.2 @xmath0 ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the central parsec of the m33 nucleus through new infrared photometry and optical / near - infrared spectroscopy , combined with ultraviolet / optical observations from the literature and the hst archive . </S>",
    "<S> the sed shows evidence for a significant level of attenuation , which we model through a monte carlo radiative transfer code as a shell of clumpy milky way - type dust ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of milky way - type dust ( with a strong 2175    bump ) internal to the m33 nucleus is different from previous work which has found smc - like dust ( no bump ) near starburst regions . </S>",
    "<S> the amount by which dust can be processed may be related to the mass and age of the starburst as well as the extent to which the dust can shield itself . </S>",
    "<S> our starburst models include the effects of this dust and can fit the sed if the nucleus was the site of a moderate ( @xmath2@xmath3 at 10 myrs ) episode of coeval star formation about 70 myrs ago . </S>",
    "<S> this result is quite different from previous studies which resorted to multiple stellar populations ( between 2 and 7 ) attenuated by either no or very little internal dust . </S>",
    "<S> the m33 nuclear starburst is remarkably similar to an older version ( 70 myr versus 10 myr ) of the ultra - compact starburst in the center of the milky way . </S>"
