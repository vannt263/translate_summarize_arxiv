    "this result could have important implications for applications to micro- and nano - mechanical devices whose reliability may crucially depend on the control of thermally activated failure .",
    "the carbon - carbon atom interactions were modeled using the `` adaptive intermolecular reactive bond order '' ( airebo ) potential  @xcite , which was originally developed as an extension of the `` reactive bond order '' potential ( rebo )  @xcite . in turn",

    "these interactions have strong coordination - dependence through a bond order parameter , which adjusts the attraction between the @xmath109 atoms based on the position of other nearby atoms and thus has 3- and 4-body dependencies . a more detailed discussion of formulas for this part of the potential are given in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath110 term adds longer - ranged interactions ( @xmath111  ) using a form similar to the standard lennard - jones potential .",
    "it contains a series of switching functions so that the short - ranged lj repulsion ( @xmath112 ) does not interfere with the energetics captured by the @xmath113 term .",
    "the extent of the @xmath110 interactions is determined by a cutoff argument ; in general the resulting @xmath110 cutoff is approximately 10   , in this work we consider a cutoff of approximately 14   .",
    "finally , the @xmath114 term is an explicit 4-body potential that describes various dihedral angle preferences in hydrocarbon configurations .",
    "the airebo potential has been extensively used to simulate and predict mechanical properties of carbon - based materials , i.e. fullerene , carbon nanotube and graphene  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it offers a valid tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency ; a realistic fracture of large system sizes can be simulated in reasonably short time scales ( a few hours on recent computers ) .",
    "other interaction models can offer little improvement to the actual realism of the simulation , at the cost of much larger computational costs : for example , the reaxff potential , or dft semiclassical approaches could describe more accurately the fast time scales of chemical reactions , but this would not change the ultimate failure length of the c - c bond : the expected maximum elongation for a c - c bond in graphene is around 0.178  nm . on the other hand , the use of faster but too simplistic models ( e.g. lennard - jones potentials , mass and spring systems , or other elastic models ) fail to significantly reproduce a realistic behavior .",
    "however , in order to simulate a realistic bond failure behavior , the short - scale c - c adaptive cutoff ( @xmath115 ) of the airebo potential has to be tuned . in fact , it has been observed  @xcite that , during simulations of fracture of covalent bonds and without cutoff tuning , the shortest - scale potential introduces a sharp increase of bond forces near the cutoff distances , which in turn causes spurious increase in fracture stress and strain  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted here that this phenomenon is specifically relevant for perfect graphene and cnt lattices , while it is much less pronounced in defected samples , due to the disorder induced in the lattice by the atom vacancies .",
    "this issue has been solved in the past by incrementing the short - scale cutoff lenght of the potential ; the cited papers increase this parameter to 2.0   .",

    "<S> we generalize the weakest - link theory of fracture size effects to rate and temperature dependent failure and find quantitative agreement with the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical and theoretical results explain the crossover of the fracture strength distribution between a thermal and rate - dependent regime and a disorder - dominated regime described by extreme value theory .    </S>",
    "<S> nanomaterials have remarkable mechanical properties , such as enhanced strength and toughness @xcite , but display considerable size effects and sample - to - sample fluctuations , which represent an issue for engineering applications . </S>",
    "<S> our current understanding of fracture size - effects in macroscopic disordered media relies on extreme value theory which relates the strength to the statistics of the weakest region in the sample @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the theory does not consider the effect of stress concentrations and crack interactions , numerical models for the failure of elastic networks with disorder show that an extreme value distribution describes failure at large enough scales , although the form usually deviates from the standard weibull distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> understanding size effects in nanomaterials is still an intriguing open issue also because of the presence of rate - dependent thermal effects that would invalidate the weakest - link hypothesis @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> testing fracture properties of graphene is quite challenging due to the difficulty in applying high tensile stresses in a controlled fashion on nanoscale objects @xcite . therefore numerical simulations represents a viable alternative to understand the size dependence of its mechanical behavior @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> finite temperature molecular dynamics simulations reveal , however , that the average tensile strength of nanotubes @xcite and graphene @xcite depends on temperature and loading rate . despite these insightful results , a comprehensive theory describing the size dependent fracture strength distribution of carbon nanomaterials , elucidating the role of thermal fluctuations and strain rate , is still lacking .    here </S>",
    "<S> we perform large scale molecular dynamics simulations of the deformation and failure of defected monolayer graphene sheets for a wide range of sample sizes , vacancy concentration , temperature and strain rate . to explain the observed temperature and rate dependence of the tensile strength distribution </S>",
    "<S> , we generalize extreme value theory to the case of thermally activated rate dependent fracture . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting theory is shown to be in excellent agreement with our simulations and provides a general framework to explain rate - dependent thermal effects in the failure of disordered nanomaterials . based on our theory , </S>",
    "<S> we derive a simple criterion that allows to assess the relative importance of structural disorder and thermal fluctuations in determining failure . using this rule </S>",
    "<S> , one can readily show that the failure of nanoscale samples is more prone to thermal induced failure , while the fracture macroscopic samples are more likely to be ruled by quenched disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms previous results showing that in the limit of very large samples failure is ruled by extreme value statistics ( although not necessarily by the weibull law ) @xcite .    </S>",
