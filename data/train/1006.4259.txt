    "supernovae ( sne ) are the final explosion marking the end of the life cycle of different types of stars .",
    "massive stars ( @xmath9 ) explode when their core can no longer synthesise new elements and undergoes collapse .",
    "thermonuclear sne ( sne ia ) are the complete explosive destruction of white dwarfs reaching the chandrasekhar mass limit , most likely via accretion in a binary system @xcite , although other channels have been proposed @xcite .",
    "there are a number of ways to measure the properties of sne and infer those of the progenitor stars : classically , the analysis of sn light curves yields information about the mass ejected in the explosion and the explosion kinetic energy @xcite . combined studies of the light curve and the spectra allow a more precise estimate of these parameters , as well as of the abundances in the ejecta , for both sneia and core - collapse sne ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "the properties of the progenitor star may be inferred through direct imaging ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) or searches for the surviving companion in the case of sneia ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the only method that looks directly at the sn ejecta when they are transparent but not yet a remnant is nebular - epoch spectroscopy .",
    "soon after the explosion , the sn nebula is still optically thick , and only the outer layers can be observed .",
    "about 6 months to one year after the explosion , however , expansion makes the nebula sufficiently thin that it becomes essentially transparent to radiation . in this phase",
    "the gas is heated by collisions with the fast particles produced in the thermalization process of the @xmath10-rays and the positrons produced in the decay of @xmath3coto @xmath3fe , and it cools via line emission . as optical depth effects are negligible , the energy that is deposited is immediately re - radiated , which makes it easier to estimate the @xmath3ni  mass  @xcite .",
    "this phase can be used to study the inner layers of sne , yielding information on the details of the explosion , both for sneia @xcite and core - collapse sne , especially those that have lost the outer layers ( type ib / c , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one major advantage of the nebular phase is that the luminosity emitted by a certain ion depends , albeit indirectly , on the mass of the ion itself . a reliable estimate of the emitting mass requires then two basic elements : observational coverage of the largest possible number of lines of different elements and a reliable calculation of the ionization and excitation state of the gas .",
    "for the latter , nlte calculations are usually performed .",
    "the former requirement implies essentially observing as wide a spectral range as possible .",
    "traditionally , because of the faintness of sne in the nebular phase and the easier availability of optical detectors , in almost all cases only optical spectra of sne in the nebular phase were obtained . however",
    ", several important line emission features are located at ir wavelengths .",
    "this includes elements such as si , which is very important for sne and has no strong emission lines in the optical , so that its mass can not be derived from optical spectra .",
    "also , the ratios of different lines of the same element can be used to determine the density of the emitting gas ( e.g.  ca  ii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( fe  ii , * ? ? ?",
    "only a very small number of nebular - phase ir spectra of sne is available , and these are typically sneia spectra ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among core - collapse sn",
    ", there are late - time ir spectra for the peculiar sniip 1987a @xcite , and for the highly reddened sniip 2002hh @xcite .",
    "the first stripped - envelope sn for which late - time ir spectra have been obtained is the type ic sn2007gr @xcite .",
    "sne ic show neither h nor he in their spectra @xcite , and come with a very diverse range of observational @xcite and physical properties @xcite .",
    "these depend on the properties of the progenitor star and the details of the explosion , ranging from ejected masses of @xmath0 , @xmath3nimasses of @xmath7 and kinetic energies of @xmath11erg for  normal \" events ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to ejected masses of @xmath12 , @xmath3ni  masses of @xmath13 and kinetic energies of @xmath14erg for grb - connected hypernovae @xcite .",
    "sn2007gr had normal luminosity and spectral appearance , but was characterised by the unusual presence of carbon lines in the early - time spectra , indicating that c was not fully burned to o @xcite .",
    "a simple light curve analysis @xcite suggests that sn2007gr ejected @xmath15 of material with kinetic energy @xmath16erg , which would make it a rather ordinary snic .",
    "high - resolution radio observations of sn2007gr revealed emission from an expanding source ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite ) .",
    "this expansion was interpreted as evidence for material moving at mildly relativistic velocities in what seems to be a bipolar jet .",
    "this is at odds with the existing picture where all sne associated with emission from relativistic material also show large expansion velocities in the early phase ( @xmath17 ) , which links the relativistic material to the bulk of the sn ejecta , and are characterised by large values of the ejected mass and the explosion energy @xcite .",
    "we use the nebular spectra of sn2007gr , including one simultaneous optical - ir spectrum obtained more than one year after the explosion , to determine the properties of the inner ejecta .    in the following , in section 2",
    "we briefly review the data we use , in section 3 we discuss the nebular model used for the calculations , section 4 presents the results of one - zone models , section 5 deals with the models obtained using a density profile , and in section 6 our results are discussed .",
    "nebular - phase spectra of sn2007gr were obtained at various epochs , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "earlier optical spectra have epochs of 103 to 158 days after maximum .",
    "these spectra are not fully nebular .",
    "the same is true for various ir spectra obtained at similar epochs . at day 375 after maximum",
    "a simultaneous optical - ir spectrum was obtained . since the optical and the ir spectra were obtained within one day of one another , spectral evolution and relative calibration",
    "are not an issue , unlike data at earlier epochs .",
    "the very advanced phase of this later spectrum ensures that it is fully nebular .",
    "the spectrum was presented in figures 7 ( optical ) and 12 ( ir ) of @xcite .",
    "here we use the very late optical - ir spectrum at 376.5 days after maximum for our calculations , and verify results using the optical spectrum at 158 days after maximum .",
    "sn2007gr exploded in a crowded region in the spiral galaxy ngc 1058 .",
    "in particular , sn2007gr is flanked on either side by a relatively bright stellar association ( see * ? ? ? * fig . 1 ) and",
    "several fainter sources within 150 pc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) . at the late epochs under consideration ,",
    "when the sn is faint in comparison with these adjacent objects , particular attention must be paid to the estimation of the background flux . in order to estimate the contribution of these sources we extracted spectra obtained in the vicinity of sn2007gr .",
    "the resulting background contribution clearly depends on the choice of location at which the flux was estimated .",
    "we experimented with several extractions along the spatial profile and chose the background contribution that best matched the underlying slope in the sn continuum .",
    "we then scaled this background to the apparent sn continuum and subtracted it from the sn spectrum ( no strong continuum is expected from the sn at late epochs ) .",
    "the contaminating sources ( within 150 pc ) are probably clusters @xcite with spectral energy distributions that peak at blue wavelengths , so while some contamination affects the entire spectrum , it is expected to be particularly severe at bluer wavelengths .",
    "we modelled the spectra of sn2007gr using a code which computes the energy deposition from the radioactive decay of @xmath3ni  and @xmath3co  in the sn ejecta , uses the deposited energy to estimate ionization and excitation , and balances this with gas cooling via line emission in a nlte scheme @xcite .",
    "the method follows that developed by @xcite .",
    "the code allows the use of clumping , expressed in terms of a clumping factor @xmath18 , which is defined as the inverse of the filling factor @xcite .",
    "this assumes that the gas is distributed uniformly , but resides in clumps .",
    "the effect of clumps is to increase the local density , and hence to favour recombination .",
    "clumping also reduces the population of the excited levels , which may be important in the context of the ratio of optical to ir flux , as suggested by @xcite . for sneib / c",
    ", @xcite found that a typical clumping @xmath19 yields best results , while for sneia clumping is not regarded to be necessary if a detailed model of the explosion is used ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the need for clumping in sneib / c may be the result of an inaccurate treatment of ionization .",
    "improvements in the treatment of ionization @xcite make the code more reliable , in particular for sne where ni and fe do not dominate the ejecta .",
    "these improvements were introduced in the context of including a treatment of oxygen recombination .",
    "a simultaneous improvement of the treatment of ionization was also necessary in order to make the calculation of the recombination rate more reliable .",
    "forbidden line emission is influenced by this new treatment only weakly .",
    "results with the old and new codes are shown and compared in section 4 .    in a one - zone version",
    ", the code assumes that the gas is distributed with uniform density and abundances within a sphere of radius @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the outer velocity of the expanding nebula , as determined from the width of the emission lines , and @xmath22 is the time elapsed from explosion .",
    "this takes advantage of the fact that in sn ejecta any given parcel of matter is characterised by a velocity which remains constant as long as the ejecta are not slowed down by interaction with circumstellar material .",
    "results obtained with this model are presented in section 4 .    in a more sophisticated version",
    "the sn envelope is divided into uniform radial shells .",
    "deposition of @xmath10-rays and positrons is computed using a montecarlo scheme , and emission is computed within each shell .",
    "this version can be used if a detailed model of the explosion is available , which describes the run of density with ejecta velocity , or if one is sought for from fitting the profile of the nebular lines ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "results obtained with this model are presented in section 5 .    for the distance and reddening to sn2007gr we use the same values ( d=9.3mpc , i.e.  distance modulus @xmath23mag ;",
    "e(b - v)@xmath24 ) as in @xcite .",
    "for the nebular spectra of sn2007gr we used first the 1-zone code to define the general properties of the ejecta . here we show 1-zone model results obtained first without and then with the oxygen recombination module and compare them .",
    "we then applied the shell model to improve the results and the fits .",
    "these are discussed in the next section .",
    "the first nebular spectrum we model was obtained on 2008 jan 29 .",
    "we assign it an epoch of 172 days after explosion , using an arbitrary risetime of 13.5 days , which is typical for sneic and is consistent with the risetime deduced by @xcite , @xmath25 days .",
    "the strongest lines in the spectrum are typical of sneic : [ o  i ] 6300 , 6363 , mg  i ] 4570 , ca  ii ] 7291 , 7324 , the ca  ii  ir triplet near 8600 , and na  i  d near 5900 .",
    "ca  ii  h&k may be seen at the blue edge of the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum can be fitted reasonably satisfactorily assuming an outer velocity of 5000 km  s@xmath2  and @xmath19 , which is typical for sneic ( figure 1 , blue line ) .",
    "the @xmath3ni  mass was kept fixed at @xmath4 , as indicated by the light curve peak @xcite .",
    "this value yields fairly good results .",
    "the mass enclosed within 5000 km  s@xmath2  is @xmath26 , oxygen being the main constituent ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "while most emission lines are reproduced , and identified in figure 1 , the main shortcomings of the model are as follows .",
    "the line near 4050  is not reproduced .",
    "this is probably [ s  ii ] 4069 , 4076 , which is predicted to be present but is much too weak when compared to the data .",
    "the low ionization degree of sulphur ( @xmath27% in the models with the old treatment of ionization ) is probably responsible for the weakness of the emission line .",
    "the broad base of [ o  i ] 6300 , 6363  is not reproduced .",
    "this is the effect of adopting a sharp outer boundary to the nebula .",
    "shell models will improve this ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the emission line at @xmath28  is not reproduced .",
    "this is most likely the recombination line o  i 7773 , which is addressed in the next sub - section .",
    "an alternative possibility is [ s  i ] 7723 .",
    "this is indeed predicted by the model as the strongest line of sulphur , but is much too weak .",
    "the second strongest sulphur line in the model is [ s  ii ] 4068 , 4076 , which is too weak for a s mass of @xmath29 .",
    "the third strongest feature is [ s  i ] 4507 , 4589 , which is completely swamped by the strong mg  i ] 4570line . in order to reproduce both the line near 7750  and that near 4050as due to sulphur , the s mass must increase to an unreasonable @xmath30 , confirming that the line near 7700  is o  i  7773",
    "additionally , cooling by s emission weakens the other lines , so that all other masses must increase , to a total of @xmath31 .",
    "such a large s mass fraction seems to contradict nucleosynthesis results @xcite .",
    "the line at 8700  is too weak .",
    "this is a blend of ca  ii  ir triplet and [ c  i ] 8727 .",
    "increasing the strength of the [ c  i ] line is not an option , as the wavelength of the line does not match that of the emission peak ( assuming spherical symmetry ) . also , the strength of the other carbon line , [ c  i ] 9825 , 9850 , is already overestimated .",
    "therefore , a weak ca  ii  line is the likely cause of the discrepancy .",
    "this may indicate a different degree of clumping than adopted in the calculation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we however refrain from investigating clumping here , since this may be better done using the optical / ir spectrum of day 390 , which has a broader wavelength coverage , and the new code , which includes oxygen recombination and an updated treatment of ionization .",
    "finally , the line at 9300 , which is mostly due to [ co  ii ] 9340 , 9345 , is not correctly reproduced .",
    "this may be caused by insufficient background subtraction .",
    "the later spectrum is fully nebular , and it is therefore to be expected that our code can reproduce it better than the earlier one .",
    "additionally , it covers both the optical and the ir essentially simultaneously , making it possible to narrow down the range of acceptable parameters .",
    "many of the strongest features are the same as on day 172 .",
    "one of the key features for modelling is the [ fe  ii ] line near 5200 .",
    "this is composed mostly of lines at 5159 , 5262 , 5273 , and 5333 .",
    "other strong lines include the structured blend near 8700 , which is due to a mix of a weak ca  ii  ir triplet , [ c  i ] 8727 , and [ fe  ii ] lines , the strongest being at 8617 and 8892  ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the [ fe  ii ] 8617line is actually the strongest of all these emissions , which explains why the observed profile peaks between ca  iiir and the [ c  i ] line . uncertainties in the strength of the [ fe  ii ] lines may be responsible for the poor reproduction of the corresponding emission at day 172 .            moving to the ir , several other features are visible which allow relative comparisons .",
    "they are labelled in figure 3 .",
    "one of the most useful is [ si  i ] 1.604 , 1.646@xmath32 , which is the strongest silicon line , blended with [ fe  ii ] 1.599 , 1.644 , 1.664@xmath32",
    ". lines of [ fe  ii ] are also seen near 1.25@xmath32 ( strongest contributors to the feature being lines at 1.249 , 1.257 , 1.270 , 1.279 , 1.321@xmath32 ) , but the spectrum is very noisy there .",
    "other lines of ime are also present in the ir .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one drawback of the nebular modelling approach is the poorly constrained distribution of @xmath3ni .",
    "the one - zone model assumes that @xmath3ni  is distributed homogeneously .",
    "some constraints on the precise distribution of @xmath3ni  can be derived from the profile of the fe  ii  blend near 5200 , but this is usually weak in sneib / c .",
    "in addition , not all @xmath3ni  distributions can consistently reproduce the evolution of the spectrum from 172 to 390 days . in our shell model",
    "@xmath3ni  is more centrally concentrated than in the one - zone models , in agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "the uncertainty on the total mass caused by this assumption should be @xmath33% .",
    "we use a clumping factor @xmath34 , which gives the best overall agreement with the observations , although individual lines or line ratios can sometimes be better reproduced using different values .",
    "any moderate value , @xmath35 seems possible , taking into account uncertainties in the atomic data and the calculation procedure .",
    "since the same model is used for both epochs ( apart from differences in the na and mg content ) , we discuss the two epochs together , focussing on individual elements .",
    "the carbon distribution is mainly derived from modelling the [ c  i ] 8727emission at 172 days .",
    "the flux in this region is a blend of [ c  i ] and ca  ii   emission and the observed flux profile can not be reproduced by any model with our nebular code .",
    "it may be that the ca  ii  flux is scattered by the carbon line , a process which is not simulated by the code .",
    "alternatively , [ fe  ii ] lines may be stronger than predicted by the model , as discussed in section 4.2.1 . at day 172",
    ", we try to reproduce the flux at the wavelength of the [ c  i ] line . using the same carbon abundance , at 390 days the synthetic [ c  i ] 8727  line is stronger than in the observations .",
    "this may be an indication that at day 172 the line was powered by scattering of ca  ii  flux : since this process is not treated in our code , we may have had to assume a higher carbon mass than is really present in the sn ejecta .",
    "since no other line of carbon is visible , the estimate of the carbon mass may thus be uncertain by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "the oxygen distribution and mass are mainly derived from modelling the [ o  i ] 6300 , 6363  doublet .",
    "the observations are matched rather well by the synthetic flux at both epochs .",
    "the strength of the [ o  i ] 5577  line depends on clumping .",
    "using a clumping factor @xmath34 it is reproduced well at 172 days . at 390 days",

    "the o  i  7773  line is not reproduced with sufficient strength at 172 days , but at 390 days the synthetic flux is in good agreement with the observations ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the formation of this line ) . the o  i  8447  line is blended with strong ca  ii  emission and can not be identified .",
    "the o  i 9264  line is too weak at day 172 .",

    "4.2 ) , which indicates that these ions are not accurately treated .",
    "in fact , the ir spectrum at day 190 shows a number of emission lines which are not reproduced by the code ( see red marks in figure 5 ) .",

    "several other lines can be identified as permitted mg  i  transitions , as indicated in fig .",
    "these lines could be produced by recombination of mg  ii . to our knowledge , this is the first time these lines are identified in a nebular spectrum of a sn .",
    "the flux in these lines is intrinsically weak ( note the factor @xmath38 difference in the vertical scale of fig . 5 with respect to fig .",
    "4 ) . inclusion of a detailed treatment of mg  ii  recombination may result in a better fit of these lines and in a more accurate determination of the mg mass .",

    ", the lack of any other [ fe  i ] lines , in particular 1.294 and 1.355@xmath32 m , which arise from the same lower level ( the ground state of fe  i ) and should have similar strength is a strong argument against this option , which remains however the only one we could find .",
    "the silicon distribution is modelled fitting the [ si  i ] 1.588 , 1.608 and 1.646@xmath32 m lines at 390 days , when the [ si  i ] feature can be observed clearly .",

    "is blended with o  i  7773 . since it is difficult to identify individual lines in the region around 4000 , we fix the sulphur mass by fitting the ir lines accurately , while aiming at an acceptable agreement for the 4070  line . at 390 days",
    "the synthetic ir lines seem to be too weak , but the observations are very noisy in that spectral region .",
    "the calcium distribution and total mass are rather uncertain . the ratio of ca  ii ] 7300  and the ir - triplet depends sensitively on density and clumping .",
    "in addition , the ir - triplet may interact with c  i  8727 , a process which is not simulated in the code .",
    "we fix the ca mass modelling the 7300  emission at 172 days .",
    "this gives a consistent result also at day 390 .",
    "since we can not obtain an estimate of the helium mass , the total mass in sn2007gr is uncertain .",

    "finally , the spectra for day 390 show an apparent mismatch between the optical and ir fe lines : most ir lines seem to be overestimated while the [ fe  ii ] emission near 5200  is too weak . in order to test",
    "whether this may be the effect of clumping , we have computed a model with a clumping factor which brings the optical synthetic spectrum into reasonable agreement with the observations .",
    "this requires extreme clumping ( @xmath37 ) : the model is shown in figures 6 and 7 as a blue line . increased clumping leads also to a reduction in the flux of the [ c  i ] lines in the optical . however , despite the large change in the flux of the optical [ fe  ii ] lines , the ir [ fe  ii ] lines are almost unaffected : increased clumping leads to a reduction of the population of the highly excited levels from which the optical lines are formed , but leaves the much larger population of the less excited levels from which the ir lines form basically unchanged",

    "the [ fe  ii ] complex near 5200  can be reproduced in sufficient strength for m(@xmath3ni)@xmath44 , but then the ir fe lines become too strong .",
    "further increase of the clumping seems unlikely : already with @xmath37 the spectrum at day 172 is poorly reproduced .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the background subtraction , the fe atomic data , the @xmath3ni  distribution and the geometry , it is not possible to determine the degree of clumping accurately , at least using the code in its present state .",
    "the availability of a simultaneous optical - ir spectrum for sn2007gr makes it possible to attempt an accurate estimate of the ejecta mass via a census of all elements that are expected to be abundant in the ejecta of a snic .",

    "our models are sensitive to material expanding with @xmath45 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we adopt here the values from the shell model , since this offers the best reproduction of the observed line fluxes and profiles .",

    "we find that oxygen is the dominant constitutent of the heavy - element ejecta , with a mass of @xmath5 .",

    "in particular the si mass , which is determined via the [ si  i ] 1.6@xmath32 m line , is only @xmath46 .",
    "since the si mass is estimated from neutral silicon , which is the dominant ion , this result is not much influenced by ionization .",
    "our estimate of the ca mass carries a larger uncertainty than for other elements since it is estimated from lines of ca  ii , which is less abundant than ca  i. uncertainties in the ionization treatment can affect the mass estimate significantly ( a factor of 3 or so ) .",
    "although we use moderate clumping ( @xmath34 ) , it is not possible , at the current level of accuracy , to determine the exact degree of clumping .",
    "the rather low value of the ejected mass may be increased if the mass of he and possibly ne , which may be present to some extent , could also be accounted for .",

    "if this estimate is correct , the he mass of sn2007gr should be @xmath47",
    ". this may be consistent with early - time observations of he  iabsorption , depending on the degree of mixing of he and radioactive material in the outer layers of the sn ejecta .",
    "the result that the mass of the co core ejected by sn2007gr was @xmath0 suggests that the sn progenitor was a star of comparatively low mass , possibly similar to the progenitor of the prototypical low - energy snic 1994i . in the case of sn1994i a star of @xmath48",
    "was proposed as the likely progenitor @xcite .",
    "the star would have lost its outer hydrogen and helium layers through binary interaction .",

    "uncertainties in a number of paramenters , like the degree of clumping , the @xmath3ni  distribution , fe collision strengths , geometry , reddening and background subtraction could be responsible for this . a high clumping factor ( @xmath49 ) or a larger @xmath3ni  mass ( @xmath7 ) can approximately reproduce the strength of the [ fe  ii ] blend .",
    "however , an increased @xmath3ni  mass leads to an over - estimate of less energetic [ fe  ii ] lines redwards of 6000 .",
    "also , a @xmath3ni  mass of more than @xmath50 is inconsistent with the 172 days spectrum .",
    "therefore we estimate a total @xmath3ni  mass between 0.07 and @xmath50 , but favour the lower values .",
    "our results are in fact consistent with the estimates of the total and @xmath3ni  mass presented in @xcite .",
    "the elemental abundances that we derived are generally consistent with the nucleosynthetic yields of a @xmath51 star at roughly solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "the major discrepancy with respect to those results is actually for silicon , which we find to be about one order of magnitude less abundant .",
    "our results are unlikely to be grossly in error because of an incorrect estimate of the ionization : si  i , the ion which is observed in the ir and from which the si mass is determined , is the dominant silicon ion .",
    "on the other hand , possible uncertainties on the collision strengths of si  i , or of the fe  ii  lines which also contribute to the feature at @xmath52 m from which the silicon abundance is measured , may cause uncertainties . if the [ fe  ii ] lines were completely removed , and the collision strength for the [ si  i ] lines remained the same , the silicon mass would increase by a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "at the same time , the results cited above , while in overall agreement , differ the most for ime ( si , s , ca ) , and more recent calculation ( s.e . woosley , priv .",
    "comm . ) show a somewhat smaller silicon mass , although again a factor of 10 error is unlikely .",
    "the most likely reason for the discrepancy may lie with the collision strengths . a new calculation of these values would be desireable .    the detection of radio emission from sn2007gr , indicating the presence of material moving at sub - relativistic velocities ( @xmath54 ) in two opposite jets @xcite is a very interesting finding .",
    "normally , sne associated with relativistic outflows such as grbs or xrfs have exceptionally large kinetic energies and massive progenitors .",
    "this does not seem to be the case for sn2007gr . actually , the nebular spectra of sn2007gr show that the core of the sn has rather low velocities , in agreement with the early phase , where @xcite found maximum velocities of @xmath55 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "actually , in a paper that appeared after submission of this paper , @xcite argue that the radio data are consistent with a non - relativistic explosion , in line with our optical results .",
    "another peculiarity of sn2007gr was the detection of strong carbon lines at early times @xcite .",
    "these lines were observed with velocities between 7000 and 10000 km  s@xmath2 . in the nebular spectra",
    "the [ c  i ] 8727  line is detected , suggesting the presence of carbon also at low velocities ( below 5000 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "modelling indicates a c / o ratio of @xmath56 , which is consistent with the inner layers of the co core of a massive star @xcite .",
    "finally , grb / sne are thought to be very aspherical @xcite .",
    "some evidence that all sneib / c are aspherical , to some extent , was found by @xcite using late - time spectra .",
    "@xcite confirmed this , but suggested that for sneib / c which are not particularly energetic there may be only a rather weak correlation between the velocities of the inner ejecta (  the core \" ) as derived from nebular spectroscopy and those of the outer ejecta , as inferred from the spectra near maximum .",
    "the highest velocities detected in the optical spectra ( @xmath57 ) are always much lower than the sub - relativistic velocities which can give rise to radio emission , so sn2007gr may be a case where a very small amount of material was ejected at @xmath58 in an otherwise normal snic @xcite .",
    "however , the recently published results of @xcite , who rule out material moving at @xmath59 are in much better agreement with our results . from the nebular spectra we find no evidence of major core asphericities in sn2007gr .",
    "this does not rule out that some asphericity may affect the innermost regions of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "this may also help with the missing silicon if more fallback occurs in the less nuclearly processed equatorial regions .",
    "clearly , further study of these very interesting events is necessary before a coherent picture that encompasses the entire range of sneib / c properties and their relation to the those of the progenitor star can emerge .",
