    "the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) 21  cm ( 1420.405752  mhz ) spin - flip transition has long been employed as an emission line tracer of the neutral gas content , surface density profile , kinematics , and dark matter halos of spiral galaxy disks in the local universe .",
    "hi 21  cm absorption , however , is rarely observed at low redshift outside of the galaxy because it relies on the chance alignment of a bright radio source with foreground gas , and the covering fraction of cold neutral gas is low .",
    "the very slow einstein rate coefficient for spontaneous emission , @xmath12  s@xmath13 , means that a detectable 21  cm line requires either a large gas mass for emission or a high column density for absorption ; the latter operationally limits hi 21  cm absorption line studies to damped systems ( @xmath14  @xmath4 ) .",
    "but the comoving density of damped ly@xmath2 ( dla ) absorption systems is only @xmath15 per unit redshift at @xmath16 @xcite , so identifying such systems in the local universe ( @xmath17 ) requires examination of many hundreds of sightlines .",
    "if they can be found , hi 21  cm absorption lines complement emission lines ; while emission line surveys are flux - limited ( mass - limited at a fixed distance ) , absorption line surveys are column density - limited ( at fixed illuminating continuum ) , independent of distance , and can identify very low - mass collections of neutral gas .",
    "hi 21  cm absorption line surveys can potentially identify primordial atomic gas , infalling or out - going gas in the vicinity of galaxies , or spiral disks themselves in a distance- and dust extinction - independent fashion .",
    "the arecibo legacy fast arecibo l - band feed array ( alfalfa ) survey is a 7000 deg@xmath1 extragalactic hi 21 cm emission line survey . compared to the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the alfalfa survey is 8 times more sensitive , has 4 times the angular resolution , 3 times the spectral resolution , and a factor of 1.4 more bandwidth @xcite , and provides the first data set approaching the sensitivity and areal coverage required for a truly `` blind '' hi 21 cm absorption line search .",
    "such a search is effectively a search for dlas that does not rely on uv - bright quasar sightlines ( and thus can detect dusty dlas ) .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the alfalfa hi 21 cm absorption pilot survey , a test of the notion that damped ly@xmath2 systems can be detected `` blindly '' in the local universe in a shallow , large area spectroscopic survey for hi emission from galaxies .",
    "we present the methods and results of our survey , along with follow - up observations conducted at the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , and demonstrate that it is possible to place meaningful upper limits on the column density frequency distribution function .",
    "the pilot survey results suggest that a search of the full 7000 deg@xmath1 of the alfalfa survey for hi 21  cm absorption would be worthwhile , both for understanding cold neutral gas in the local universe and in preparation for planned absorption line surveys at high and low redshift with upcoming new radio telescopic facilities .",
    "the alfalfa survey offers the combined sensitivity , areal coverage , and redshift span to make a `` blind '' hi 21  cm absorption line search feasible and astrophysically interesting",
    ". the complete alfalfa survey will cover @xmath187000 deg@xmath1 and is expected to detect more than 25,000 galaxies in hi 21  cm emission @xcite .",
    "the data products of the survey are dual - polarization 2.4@xmath192.4@xmath20 1024-channel spectral data cubes spanning 25 mhz each .",
    "there are four spectrally overlapping cubes per sky position spanning the range @xmath21  km  s@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the rms noise per spectral channel after smoothing to 10  km  s@xmath13 is 2.2  mjy @xcite .",
    "our alfalfa hi absorption pilot survey examines a 517 deg@xmath1 subset of the mature alfalfa data product in the northern virgo cluster region , spanning @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( 122 spectral cubes ) .",
    "we omit a 1.6 deg@xmath1 region centered on m  87 ; the strong radio source in m  87 ( 220 jy at 1.4 ghz ) creates spectral standing waves that render this region inaccessible to weak line spectroscopy with arecibo @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : sources ] shows the survey area and distribution of radio sources with @xmath24  jy .",
    "we searched a velocity range @xmath25 , with notable gaps due to radio frequency interference or galactic hi emission at @xmath26 , 2200 , 3300 , and 8800  km  s@xmath13 of about 200  km  s@xmath13 width plus a large gap at 15,00016,000  km  s@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the gaps in the spectral coverage render @xmath1810@xmath27 of the velocity range unsearchable .",
    "the net search covers @xmath28 along each line of sight plus the range @xmath29 .",
    "this translates into a comoving path length of @xmath30 and @xmath31 cosmology @xcite .",
    "making no assumptions about global curvature , @xmath32 , the comoving path length is @xmath33 .",
    "we use the @xmath34 quantity only in the calculation of the column density frequency distribution function ( sec . [",
    "sec : analysis ] ) ; otherwise , @xmath35 is used to describe the survey . ] .",
    "our line search relies on the optimized matched filter detection methods developed by @xcite : we multiply the continuum - subtracted data cubes by @xmath361 and run the line - finding algorithm as if we were searching for narrow gaussian hi emission lines .",
    "@xcite obtains matched filter ( not single - channel ) signal - to - noise ( s / n ) thresholds for both reliability ( detections are reliably not spurious ) and completeness ( all lines are detected ) of 5.5 and 6.5 , respectively , for narrow lines in the alfalfa survey .",
    "our absorption line search used the conventional alfalfa matched filter s / n of 4.6 to search for lines with central depth greater than 7.7 mjy toward continuum sources with flux densities greater than 8.4 mjy ( this continuum threshold corresponds to a line center optical depth of 2.5 and a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath37  @xmath4 assuming hydrogen spin [ 21  cm line excitation ] temperature @xmath38  k , a source covering fraction @xmath39 of unity , and a 30  km  s@xmath13 fwhm line width ) .",
    "we chose this continuum threshold to allow for the possibility of detecting very large column densities ; while expected to be very rare , the number of sources probing such regimes on the sky is large .",
    "our low s / n threshold does identify many spurious absorption lines , which we subsequently assess using five criteria : ( 1 ) association with nvss radio sources ( the 45  nvss beam is well - matched to the 1  alfalfa pixels ) ; ( 2 ) similar line properties in both linear polarizations ; ( 3 ) unresolved angular size ; ( 4 ) no association with radio frequency interference ; and ( 5 ) no association with spectral standing waves .",
    "possible absorption lines that meet these criteria were subsequently re - observed with the gbt ( section [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the vast majority of lines detected using our s / n threshold of 4.6 were obviously spurious , in large part because we were searching below the reliability threshold .",
    "for the calculation of column density statistics ( section [ sec : analysis ] ) , we require confidence that detected lines are real ( reliability ) and that a non - detection is in fact a non - detection ( completeness ) , so we impose the more severe s / n cut of 6.5 , corresponding to the @xcite estimate of the 90% completeness limit .",
    "for the gaussian narrow line template with fwhm of 30  km  s@xmath13 , this corresponds to a line peak of 11.0 mjy .",
    "allowing for opaque lines , we make a continuum cut at the same level . for the full line search",
    ", there are 8983 radio sources with @xmath40  mjy , but for the restricted column density statistics , we reduced the sample to 7296 sources with @xmath41  mjy .",
    "the distribution of continua for the full sample is shown in figure [ fig : fluxes ] .",
    "supplemental observations were required for two samples : candidate hi absorption systems , and strong continuum sources .",
    "strong sources create spectral standing waves between the primary reflector and the superstructure blocking the aperture of arecibo , frustrating the detection of weak lines .",
    "it is possible that a technique can someday be developed which replicates the `` double position - switching '' mode of arecibo in software using continuum templates within the survey data .",
    "but in the meantime , it was necessary to observe strong continuum sources , @xmath42  mjy , individually ( section [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the strong sources in our sample span the range 220  mjy@xmath43  jy ( and exclude m  87 at 220  jy ) , but the majority fall in the range 220500  mjy .",
    "we observed 13 candidate absorption systems and 250 `` strong '' sources ( nvss flux density greater than 220 mjy ) with the gbt in april through august , 2008 .",
    "the gbt is particularly well - suited to weak spectral line detection toward strong continuum sources thanks to its unblocked aperture .",
    "observations of all sources were designed to mimic the spectral resolution , spectral coverage , and sensitivity of the alfalfa survey .    for the follow - up observations of line candidates , we observed for a total of 10 minutes on - source in a 5-minute position - switched mode using two linear polarizations , 9-level sampling , 6-second records , and a 50 mhz bandwidth centered on the tentative line .",
    "the strong sources were observed in a search mode using two overlapping 50  mhz bands spanning 95  mhz from 1335.4 to 1430.4  mhz ( @xmath44 to 19,080  km  s@xmath13 ) for 5 minutes on - source with a reference `` off '' spectrum recorded roughly every fifth source .",
    "we used two linear polarizations , 9-level sampling , and 3-second records .",
    "for all observations , a calibration diode signal was injected for half of each record .",
    "each individual off - source - flattened and calibrated spectral record was manually examined and flagged for rfi , then averaged in time and polarization .",
    "after polynomial baseline subtraction , we achieved 1.3  mjy rms noise in 10.4  km  s@xmath13 channels ( at 1400  mhz ) toward the candidate absorbers after hanning and gaussian smoothing and averaging polarizations .",
    "we reached @xmath45  mjy rms noise toward the 151 strong sources with continua in the range 220370  mjy , @xmath46  mjy toward the 83 sources of 3701000  mjy , @xmath47  mjy toward the 12 sources of 1.02.0  jy , and @xmath48  mjy toward the 4 sources of 2.05.3  jy ( the quoted uncertainties span the range of rms noise values in each source grouping ) .",
    "all gbt data reduction and analysis was performed with gbtidl .",
    "we made no new detections of hi 21 cm absorption ( intrinsic or intervening ) in the pilot survey : no alfalfa absorption line candidates were confirmed by gbt observations , and no strong sources observed with the gbt show absorption lines . despite the lack of new detections , the uniform data set and large number of continuum sources in the survey allow us to place limits on the column density frequency distribution function @xmath49 ( section [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "each non - detection of hi absorption toward a radio continuum source places an upper limit on the hi column density of @xmath50 where the limit on optical depth is set by s / n@xmath51 corresponding to the completeness limit , @xmath52 and we assume the minimum fwhm matched filter template line width used for the search , 30  km  s@xmath13 . for the strong sources observed independently at the gbt , we adjust the 11  mjy line limit above according to the rms noise : it is unchanged for the 220370  mjy sources ( 2.2  mjy rms ) , but increases to 28  mjy for the strongest source at 5.3  jy",
    ". we can generally detect _ any _ dla toward the strong sources .",

    "the lowest detectable column density under these assumptions is @xmath54  @xmath4 ( but see figure [ fig : columns ] ) .",
    "we have re - detected the strong intrinsic hi absorption line in the interacting system ugc  6081 at @xmath55  km  s@xmath13 , previously detected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "gaussian fits to the alfalfa hi absorption spectrum ( figure [ fig : ugc6081 ] ) are listed in table [ tab : ugc6081 ] .",
    "a two - component fit produces a residual spectrum nearly consistent with the rms noise ( a three - component fit is not warranted by the data ) .",
    "ugc  6081 lies in a region not covered by iras , but it does appear in the 2mass catalog as multiple sources ( @xmath5613.5 , * ? ? ? * ) and is likely a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) . despite the strong hi absorption ,",
    "the main 18  cm oh lines were not detected in this system at the level of 5.2  mjy rms in 9  km  s@xmath13 channels @xcite .",
    "the first survey resolves this system into two radio sources : the nw component is the stronger at 140.3(0.1 )  mjy ; the se component has an integrated flux density of 30.8(0.1 )  mjy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure [ fig : ugc6081sdss ] ) . @xcite and @xcite assumed that the radio continuum was a single source and incorrectly used the aggregate flux density at 1370 or 1400  mhz to compute the optical depth and hi column density .",
    "since no interferometric spectral line observations have been conducted of this system to date , and the 16  separation of the two continuum sources is not resolved by the alfalfa survey ( the alfa beam is 3.3@xmath573.8 ) , the source(s ) of the hi absorption remains somewhat ambiguous .",
    "note that the measured redshifts of the two merging components are consistent with both hi absorption lines and can not resolve the hi provenance @xcite .",
    "the stronger hi component must originate in the stronger ( nw ) component of ugc  6081 because the line is deeper than the flux density of the se continuum source .",
    "the weaker , blueshifted hi component , however , could arise in either radio continuum source .",
    "we compute optical depths assuming that all hi absorption originates in the nw radio source , and we obtain a very large total hi column density of @xmath58  @xmath4 by direct integration of the observed spectrum ( rather than from the gaussian fits ) .",
    "this column density is a factor of 1.4 and 2.8 larger than the values obtained by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , due in large part to larger and confused continua employed in the previous calculation of optical depths .",
    "note that if @xmath59  k , @xmath60 , or the blue line were associated with the se component , then the already very large column density would be even larger .",

    "this demonstrates that despite the unconstrained nature of the spin temperature and covering factor , a distribution of values is well - represented in the @xmath9 upper limit locus by a mean value .",
    "also , although @xmath74 is unconstrained source - by - source , the prior on this quantity can still produce a useful constraint on @xmath9 , increasingly so as surveys get larger or more sensitive ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) .",

    "the calculation of @xmath9 is influenced by the choice of column density interval @xmath67 because we are calculating upper limits : the numerator in equation [ eqn : fofn ] is independent of the number of sources whereas the denominator grows with @xmath67 .",
    "we chose @xmath77  dex as a compromise between good statistics in most bins and resolution of @xmath9 along the column density axis , but it should be borne in mind that these limits do depend on this choice .",
    "with coarser sampling , @xmath9 moves lower but does not become inconsistent with the fits to @xmath9 obtained by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the column density sensitivity is proportional to the combination of factors fwhm@xmath78 ; if this quantity decreases , the sources are redistributed into lower column bins , driving the @xmath9 values lower .",
    "a line fwhm smaller than the assumed 30  km  s@xmath13 is likely in many dlas , suggesting that an average value of @xmath79  k is probably too low ( figure [ fig : fofn ] ) .",
    "a source of systematic uncertainty in our calculation of @xmath9 is the unknown redshift distribution of the illuminating radio sources .",
    "we have assumed for this analysis that all radio sources lie at @xmath80  km  s@xmath13 , but there are certainly cases to the contrary ( e.g. , ugc  6081 ) .",
    "this error operates in one direction : it diminishes the total redshift search path of the survey , driving our @xmath9 limit upward .",
    "the size of this effect , however , is very small : using the redshift distribution of nvss sources with @xmath81  mjy determined by @xcite and fit by @xcite , we calculate that no more than about 60 sources in the 517  deg@xmath1 pilot survey lie within the observed redshift range , which is 0.8% of the sample .",
    "the redshift distribution of these sources will also be skewed toward the high redshift side of the survey , so the effect of this incomplete redshift coverage is truly negligible .",
    "since we obtain only upper limits on the column density frequency distribution @xmath9 , its moments , such as the hi mass density ( @xmath82 or equivalently @xmath83 ) and the comoving covering fraction @xmath84 , are dominated by the endpoint limits and thus not well constrained by our observations .",
    "it is likely that such moments can be computed from future surveys ( section [ subsec : future ] ) .",
    "our lack of detections is perfectly consistent with expectations and recent work on damped ly@xmath2 lines and hi 21  cm emission ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "our upper limits on the column density frequency distribution function are consistent with previous determinations of @xmath9 , both at high redshift ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* via ly@xmath2 absorption ) and low ( * ? ? ?",
    "* via hi 21  cm emission ) .",
    "figures [ fig : fofn ] and [ fig : fofnrandom ] show that an expanded survey would either start making absorption line detections or will place a strong statistical limit on the hydrogen spin temperature to source covering fraction ratio ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we suspect that it will be the latter , but in any case , our results provide strong motivation for a more sensitive or a larger area survey . for example , a search for absorption lines in the full alfalfa survey would increase the comoving search path @xmath34 by a factor of 14 ( 1.15 dex ) in each @xmath66 bin , which will place the @xmath9 95% confidence limits in conflict with previous measurements of the distribution over the range @xmath85  @xmath86  @xmath4 unless either dlas are detected or @xmath87  k on average .",
    "clearly a more productive approach to obtain the column density frequency distribution @xmath9 at @xmath16 is via hi 21 cm emission lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but beyond z@xmath88 , where the emission line flux density becomes prohibitively weak for anything less than a square kilometer of collecting area , one would use a distance - independent absorption line survey such as the pilot survey presented here . furthermore , `` blind '' 21  cm - based detections of dlas can identify dusty sightlines that would otherwise be missed by optical / uv surveys , which is key to identifying exceptionally rare molecular absorption systems and addressing the fraction of dusty dlas .      as figures [ fig : columns ] , [ fig : fofn ] , and [ fig : fofnrandom ] demonstrate , even incremental improvements in survey sensitivity would lead to large improvements in column density sensitivity and statistics because the source population grows as a power law as the 1.4  ghz flux density decreases ( figure [ fig : fluxes ] ) . but for strong sources , which provide probes of low column density , areal coverage remains important .",
    "the first step should be to search the full alfalfa survey for 21  cm absorption lines ; this pilot survey covered 7% of the full survey , so an order of magnitude increase in search path is possible using extant data .",
    "this will either produce detections of intervening absorption line systems or lower the limits on the column density frequency distribution function , indicating a statistical lower bound on spin temperature ( modulo covering fraction ) .",
    "it is already clear from figure [ fig : fofn ] that the typical spin temperature of hi gas at @xmath89 can not be less than @xmath90  k.    future facilities that could perform commensal or dedicated 21  cm absorption line surveys include square kilometer array ( ska ) prototypes , including the 256-element allen telescope array , the ska molonglo prototype , the australian ska pathfinder , and the karoo array telescope ( meerkat ) , as well as epoch of reionization ( eor ) and dark ages telescopes , such as a lunar far - side array , the low frequency array ( lofar ) , the precision array to probe the eor , and the murchison widefield array .",
    "these facilities will provide various combinations of areal coverage , bandwidth ( @xmath91 per source ) , and sensitivity . as we have demonstrated here , sensitivity is key because it determines the number of sightlines available per solid angle of sky surveyed , and the power - law increase in radio source counts with decreasing flux density means that even slight improvements in sensitivity will lead to large gains in the size of absorption line surveys .",
    "bandwidth and areal coverage , in comparison , grow absorption line surveys linearly .",
    "while absorption line detection is distance independent , which is an enormous advantage over redshifted emission line surveys , future hi absorption line surveys will have to contend with the issue of unknown redshifts of the continuum population and the loss of foreground sources in the total redshift search path .",
    "our `` blind '' pilot survey for hi 21  cm absorption lines in a 517 deg@xmath1 section of the alfalfa survey spanning @xmath0 detected no new absorption line systems , but re - detected the intrinsic absorption in ugc  6081 .",
    "we calculate column density sensitivity limits toward a sample of 7296 radio sources and construct upper limit envelopes for the column density frequency distribution function @xmath9 that are consistent with previous work at high and low redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results suggest that higher redshift , larger solid angle , larger bandwidth , and especially more sensitive surveys will be an astrophysically worthwhile pursuit in terms of constraining the 21  cm spin temperature and detecting dusty damped ly@xmath2 systems as well as dlas toward optically faint but radio - loud illumination sources .",
    "a subset of these hi 21  cm absorption systems will also host the exceptionally rare and elusive molecular absorption systems , which can be employed to study cold molecular gas at high redshift and to constrain the cosmic evolution of fundamental physical constants .",

    "<S> we present the results of a pilot survey for neutral hydrogen ( hi ) 21  cm absorption in the arecibo legacy fast arecibo l - band feed array ( alfalfa ) survey . </S>",
    "<S> this project is a wide - area `` blind '' search for hi absorption in the local universe , spanning @xmath0 and covering 517.0 deg@xmath1 ( 7% of the full alfalfa survey ) . </S>",
    "<S> the survey is sensitive to hi absorption lines stronger than 7.7  mjy ( 8983 radio sources ) and is 90% complete for lines stronger than 11.0  mjy ( 7296 sources ) . the total redshift interval sensitive to all damped ly@xmath2 ( dla ) systems ( @xmath3  @xmath4 ) is @xmath5 ( 129 objects , assuming @xmath6  k and covering fraction unity ) ; for super - dlas ( @xmath7  @xmath4 ) it is @xmath8 ( 2353 objects ) . </S>",
    "<S> we re - detect the intrinsic hi absorption line in ugc  6081 but detect no intervening absorption line systems . </S>",
    "<S> we compute a 95% confidence upper limit on the column density frequency distribution function @xmath9 spanning four orders of magnitude in column density , @xmath10  @xmath11  @xmath4 , that is consistent with previous redshifted optical damped ly@xmath2 surveys and the aggregate hi 21  cm emission in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> the detection rate is in agreement with extant observations . </S>",
    "<S> this pilot survey suggests that an absorption line search of the complete alfalfa survey  or any higher redshift , larger bandwidth , or more sensitive survey , such as those planned for square kilometer array pathfinders or a low frequency lunar array  will either make numerous detections or will set a strong statistical lower limit on the typical spin temperature of neutral hydrogen gas . </S>"
