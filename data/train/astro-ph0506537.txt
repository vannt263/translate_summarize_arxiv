    "the layered disc model was proposed by @xcite to account for accretion - related phenomena in t tauri stars .",
    "he assumed that the angular momentum is transported by the magneto - rotational instability , commonly referred to as the mri @xcite .",
    "however , in the outer disc ( beyond @xmath0  au ) the temperature and the ionization degree is so low that the gas is not well coupled to the magnetic field and the mri decays .",
    "there , the only parts of the disc in which the mri can operate are the surface layers that are ionized by cosmic rays ( ionization due to x - ray quanta emitted by the central star was also considered ; see @xcite ) .",
    "sandwiched between the active surface layers is an mri - free , and , consequently , non - viscous area near the mid - plane of the disc , commonly referred to as the dead zone .",
    "an interesting property of layered discs is that , in general , the accretion rate @xmath1 is a function of the radius @xmath2 .",
    "the specific form of this function depends on the mass - weighted opacity .",
    "however , @xmath1 increases with @xmath2 if the opacity does not depend on the density and increases with the temperature not faster than @xmath3 .",
    "this is true in the range @xmath4  k @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath5 @xmath7  k , where the opacity is dominated by ice - free grains , and also between @xmath8  k and @xmath4  k , where the opacity drops due to the sublimation of ices as @xmath6 grows . at temperatures below @xmath8  k",
    "the opacity varies as @xmath3 , and the accretion rate is constant as a function of @xmath2 ( in this paper we use opacities of gas and dust mixture according to @xcite ) .    when @xmath1 increases with @xmath2 , an annulus centred at @xmath9 receives more mass per unit time from the outer disc @xmath10 than that it loses to the inner disc @xmath11 .",
    "as a result , the mass accumulates in the dead zone .",
    "eventually , at one or more locations in the dead zone the surface density becomes so large that the heat released by the accretion of the accumulated matter pushes the temperature to a level at which the collisional ionization can restore the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field .",
    "in such case a triggering event , e.g. perturbation due to the passage of the companion star , heat flux from the inner active disc or gravitational instability of the dead zone @xcite , could start the accretion and `` ignite '' the dead zone , making at least part of it active .",
    "consequently , the rate at which mass is accreted by the central star could increase dramatically .",
    "this mechanism was suggested by @xcite to explain the fu ori type outbursts @xcite .",
    "the layered disc model was further developed by @xcite , who noted that the non - zero thickness of the dead zone is an important factor influencing the structure of the active surface layers ( this is because their structure depends on the vertical component of gravity , which in turn depends on the distance from the mid - plane ) .",
    "on the other hand , detailed mhd simulations of surface layers performed in a 3d shearing box approximation by @xcite showed that mri - driven , non - axisymmetric density waves can propagate far into the dead zone . as a result ,",
    "a purely hd turbulence is excited there , providing an effective viscosity .",
    "our original intention was to study how the evolution of the dead zone may be affected by the radiative heating from the inner active part of the disc . to that end",
    ", we performed extensive two - dimensional ( axisymmetric ) simulations of the evolution of layered discs , allowing for radiative energy transfer in both radial and vertical directions .",
    "unexpectedly , we found that the dead zone is unstable in a way that has not been reported before ; namely , it tends to decompose into rings . in the present paper",
    "we illustrate this `` ring '' instability with numerical simulations , and we discuss it analytically , providing a physical explanation of the observed phenomena .",
    "the remaining results of our simulations will be reported in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe the numerical code and we list the assumptions underlying our simulations .",
    "a layered - disc model whose dead zone decomposes into rings is presented in  3 . ",
    "4 contains an analytical discussion of the ring instability .",
    "finally , in  5 we summarize our results and discuss the effects of the ring instability in more sophisticated disc models .",
    "the simulations are performed with the help of the 3-d code tramp @xcite .",

    "after the convergence has been achieved , the updated temperature is calculated from the updated radiation energy density .",
    "the advection routine for mass , momentum and energy is based on a second - order monotonic transport scheme originally introduced by @xcite and optimized by @xcite . for more details about the numerical code we refer to @xcite",
    ".    the models are axially symmetric .",
    "we allow for the flow through the midplane of the disc , i.e. we do not impose a reflecting boundary condition there .",
    "grid points are spaced logarithmically in @xmath2 , resulting in a progressively smaller radial extent of grid cells near the centre of the disc , where their vertical extent is also progressively smaller .",
    "thus , the shape of grid cells is more nearly regular throughout the grid .",

    "@xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the column density integrated from the surface of the disc along a line perpendicular to the midplane , and @xmath42 is the column density ionized by the cosmic rays .    beyond the dead zone the viscosity coefficient is defined according to the @xmath33-prescription of @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath33 is a dimensionless parameter , @xmath44 is the sound speed and @xmath45 is the thickness of the active layer which is determined from the vertical distribution of density for each radius at each time - step .",
    "we chose this particular form of shakura - sunyaev prescription because it is closer to the analytical , vertically averaged model . within the dead zone we set @xmath46 .    to avoid numerical problems ,",
    "we introduce a density limiter : whenever the density falls below @xmath47 ( which may be different for different models ) , it is doubled , and the temperature is adjusted so as to keep the pressure unchanged .",
    "this procedure leads to the formation of a low - density `` atmosphere '' surrounding the disc . to prevent it from collapsing onto the disc , we artificially damp vertical and radial velocities in this region",
    "however , this artificial readjustment only affects a negligible number of grid cells in the `` atmosphere '' , and the overall evolution of the disc is not influenced .",

    "the viscosity coefficient is proportional to the local thickness of the active zone @xmath45 ( this is motivated by the idea that @xmath45 is a natural scale that limits the maximum size of the edies of the mhd turbulence ) . therefore , smaller @xmath45 results in a lower viscosity in the elevated part of the active layer . the accretion rate , which depends on the derivative of viscosity ( see eq .",

    "this causes a bottle - neck effect in the accretion flow , and the mass accumulates in the ring . on the other hand",

    "<S> in this work we use the radiation hydrodynamic code tramp to perform a two - dimensional axially symmetric model of the layered disc . using this model </S>",
    "<S> we follow the accumulation of mass in the dead zone due to the radially varying accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> we found a new type of instability which causes the dead zone to split into rings . </S>",
    "<S> this `` ring instability '' works due to the positive feedback between the thickness of the dead zone and the mass accumulation rate .    </S>",
    "<S> we give an analytical description of this instability , taking into account non - zero thickness of the dead zone and deviations from the keplerian rotational velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical model agrees reasonably well with results of numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we speculate about the possible role of the ring instability in protoplanetary discs and in the formation of planets .    </S>",
