    "it is well known that there is a gap between quantum and classical mechanics .",
    "nanomechanics is required for the development of nanotechnology that was proposed first in 1959 by richard feynman [ 1 ] .",
    "now it becomes possible to find way to bridge the gap due to the understanding of quantum reality and interference phenomena as presented in ref.[2 ] . in the article",
    "a particle is described as a non - spreading wave packet satisfying a linear equation within the framework of special relativity and quantum interference experiments are explained with a hypothesis that there is a coupling interaction between the peaked and non - peaked pieces of the wave packet .",
    "it has also been mentioned that concerning a macroscopic object , for example , a tiny grain of sand , roughly speaking , because the outer matter in it , like a barrier , screens nearly completely the off - peak part of the inner matter , the diffraction and interference of the grains fundamentally do not take place when they pass through slits .",
    "the concept that the effective screening effect increases with increasing size of an object gives a logical description of transition from quantum to classical mechanics and paves way for development of nanomechanics and nanotechnology .",
    "this article will present some typical consequences of the concept to display the transition and the simultaneous wave - particle duality of nanoparticles .",
    "the explanation of the transition in terms of environment - induced decoherence proposed by such as zurek [ 3 ] seems to be untenable .",
    "a grain of matter in size larger than 100 nm is generally considered as a macroscopic object and a particle up to 1 nm as a perfect quantum particle such as fullerene @xmath0 [ 4 ] . in order to illustrate the behavior of nanoparticles we consider a spherical nanoparticle as a model as shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "[ fig.1 ]    let _ m _ denote the mass of the effective screening layer , _ m _ the total mass and @xmath1 the effective screening mass parameter ( esmp ) .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath2 denote the average mass density of the spherical nanoparticle , @xmath3 the radius of the nanoparticle and @xmath4 the thickness of the effective screening layer , so @xmath5 and @xmath6/3 .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath7 as an effective screening size parameter ( essp ) is @xmath8 @xmath9 since the thickness of the screening layer having quantum behavior can be assumed to have a value around a certain value , say 5 nm , the larger the size of the nanoparticle is , the more it is like a classical particle .",
    "now we can investigate diffraction of nanoparticles from a single slit and interference from a double slit in terms of the screening effect .",
    "assuming that _ x _ axis is perpendicular to a slit in the slit plane and _ z _ axis perpendicular to the slit plane , according to quantum mechanics , if the wave function at the slit is @xmath10 , the diffraction of a particle can be calculated by using the fourier transformation [ 5 ] @xmath11 the momentum of the diffracted particle is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the velocity component of the particle along _ z _ axis . for a nanoparticle with the esmp @xmath14",
    ", its momentum is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the diffraction contribution of the effective screening layer and is equal to @xmath17 as illustrated in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the normalized function of the single slit of width , say , 50 nm , as shown in fig.2(a ) is @xmath18        [ fig.2 ]    @xmath19    substituting @xmath20 for @xmath21 into eq.3 , we have the normalized momentum wave function @xmath22 and the normalized momentum distribution of the nanoparticle : @xmath23 in the natural unit , the distributions @xmath24 with different values of @xmath14 are shown in fig.3 .     of the nanoparticle in the single slit diffraction with different effective screening mass parameters @xmath14.,width=432,height=238 ]    [ fig.3 ]",
    "we see the width of the distribution decreases to its classical limit as @xmath25 , instead of wrong @xmath26 .",
    "likewise , as shown in fig.2(b ) , the normalized function of the double slit is @xmath27 @xmath28 the normalized momentum distributions of the nanoparticle with different values of @xmath14 in the double slit interference are calculated in the same way as above for the single slit .",
    "the distributions @xmath24 are shown in fig.4 .",
    "of the nanoparticle in the double slit interference with different effective screening mass parameters @xmath14.,width=432,height=235 ]    [ fig.4 ]    we see the width of the distribution decreases to its classical limit as @xmath25 .",
    "clearly , the diffraction of nanoparticles from a grating can be calculated in the same way .",
    "the patterns of the single slit diffraction and double slit interference can be calculated from the momentum distributions if the momentum ( @xmath29 ) of the nanoparticle and the distance between the slit screen and the detector screen are given .",
    "consider an infinite square potential well of width _",
    ", that is , the potential function @xmath30    @xmath31    as seen in any quantum mechanics textbooks , the quantized energy and normalized wave function of a particle of mass _ m _ in the well are @xmath32    @xmath33    the fourier transformation of eq.15 yields the momentum wave functions @xmath34 now , for a nanoparticle with the esmp @xmath14 , let _",
    "p _ denote the momentum of the effective screening layer .",
    "substituting @xmath35 for _ p _ into eq.16 yields @xmath36 thus , we have the normalized momentum distribution @xmath37 of the nanoparticle consists of the quantum part _",
    "p _ and classical part @xmath38 , that is , @xmath39 let @xmath40 denote the normalized momentum distribution of the nanoparticle with respect to _",
    "p_. it can be obtained from @xmath41 by making use of the translation @xmath42 . as an illustration example , taking @xmath43 in the natural unit and @xmath44 , the momentum distributions @xmath45 are calculated and shown in fig.5 .",
    "we see the distribution approaches to the classical limit @xmath46 as @xmath47 .     of the nanoparticle inside the infinite square potential",
    "well with different effective screening mass parameters @xmath14.,width=432,height=228 ]    [ fig.5 ]",
    "with regard to tunnelling effects , we consider a particle with momentum @xmath48 and kinetic energy @xmath49 passing through or over a one - dimensional square potential barrier of height @xmath50 and thickness _",
    "l_. according to quantum mechanics , its wave function can be split into three parts : @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    as seen in any quantum mechanics textbooks , for the case where @xmath54 , the transmission coefficient is @xmath55^{-1}\\ ] ] and for @xmath56 , substituting @xmath57 for @xmath58 into eq.21 , the transmission coefficient is @xmath59^{-1}\\ ] ] the reflection coefficient is @xmath60    now we are going to calculate the transmission coefficient and reflection coefficients of a nanoparticle with the esmp @xmath14 .",
    "since the momentum of the effective screening layer is @xmath61 outside the barrier and @xmath62 inside the barrier , we have to substitute @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath58 into the wave functions .",
    "clearly the substitution is equivalent to substituting @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "so , for the case where @xmath54 , we obtain the transmission coefficient @xmath68^{-1}\\ ] ] and for @xmath56 , similarly , we have @xmath69^{-1}\\ ] ] the reflection coefficient is @xmath70 for example , for the case where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , taking @xmath44 and @xmath73 , the transmission coefficient curves @xmath74 are shown in fig.6(a ) . if taking @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the curves @xmath77 are shown in fig.6(b ) .",
    "here we have taken @xmath43 in the natural unit .",
    "for the case where @xmath56 : ( a ) the curves @xmath74 with different values of _ m _ , ( b ) the curves @xmath77 with different values of _",
    "l_.,width=345,height=169 ]    [ fig.6 ]    we see the transmission coefficients approach to their classical limits as @xmath25 .",
    "in 1927 , heisenberg stated : @xmath78the more precisely the position is determined , the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant , and vice vera.@xmath79 [ 6 ] this rule is known as heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "its physical reasoning has been offered in ref.[2 ] .",
    "the principle is basically formulated by the relation @xmath80 now , for a nanoparticle with the esmp @xmath14 , since @xmath81 as seen from fig.1(b ) , the heisenberg relation becomes @xmath82 figs.3 - 6 illustrate the momentum uncertainty of nanoparticles , which decreases with decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "we would have similar energy - time , angle momentum - angle and other uncertainty relations .",
    "thus the heisenberg uncertainty principle is in some degree dependent on @xmath14 applicable to nanoparticles and completely unapplicable to macroscopic objects .",
    "the fact that the momentum and position are exactly measurable in classical physics reflects the limit @xmath83 , instead of wrong limit @xmath84 .",
    "it is a logical mistake to regard @xmath67 as a variable instead of a definite constant .",
    "we have calculated the momentum distributions of nanoparticles in diffraction and interference dependent on the effective screening mass parameter or size parameter and presented the calculations for a nanoparticle inside an infinite square potential well and for a tunnelling nanoparticle through a square potential barrier .",
    "these results display the transition from quantum to classical mechanics and the simultaneous wave - particle duality of nanoparticles .",
    "the concept that the effective screening effect increases with increasing size of an object paves way for development of nanomechanics and nanotechnology ."
