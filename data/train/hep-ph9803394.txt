    "kinetic equations describe the time evolution of a certain chosen set of physical variables .",
    "the choice of physical variables in principle is arbitrary , but often in practice is governed by the measurement of interest .",
    "typical examples are the order parameter of a complex system or the coordinate of a brownian particle in a heat reservoir .",
    "the kinetic approach is usually implemented through a proper separation of the microscopic equations of motion of the chosen physical variables into regular and random parts .",
    "an averaging over the random part then generates the effective partition function for the regular part .",
    "this averaging is often referred to as a coarse - graining .",
    "one typical application of the kinetic approach is when the physical variables of interest possess energy in relative excess or deficiency to the rest of a large system .",
    "kinetic theory then describes the approach to equilibrium of the chosen physical variables , as for example in the kinetics of phase transitions or in brownian motion . in the former case , the system is able to release energy to the environment due to some change in its internal state .",
    "provided the environment is disproportionately large relative to the system , the process is irreversible . for a continuous transition , the focus of the present work",
    ", this process of equilibration can be described by the monotonic change of an appropriate order parameter , which is the chosen physical variable .",
    "many systems are known to relax in this manner .",
    "phenomenologically , they are successfully described by the time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in examining under which circumstances physical variables whose microscopic dynamics is second order in time , as for example the higgs order parameter of spontaneous symmetry breaking , may have a dynamics which is effectively first order in time as in ginzburg - landau phenomenological models .    qualitatively it is not difficult to argue the plausibility of this standard picture for the higgs symmetry breaking scenario . a single variable , the higgs order parameter , is modeled to control the release of energy to all the modes that couple to it . by basic notions of equipartition ,",
    "one anticipates that some portion of the order parameter s energy will flow irreversibly to any given mode . provided the higgs order parameter couples to a sufficient number of modes",
    ", the motion of the order parameter will be overdamped .    in particle physics models ,",
    "higgs symmetry breaking is accompanied by mass generation .",
    "thus the natural couplings for the higgs field @xmath0 to bosonic fields @xmath1 is @xmath2 , gauge fields @xmath3 is @xmath4 and fermionic fields @xmath5 is @xmath6 . for a microscopic realization of time dependent ginzburg - landau theory for the higgs scalar order parameter in a particle physics setting ,",
    "these are the most obvious types of couplings to investigate . in this paper",
    "we will examine the case of purely bosonic couplings in the `` symmetry restored '' regime .",
    "that is , we will study the relaxation of an order parameter which is initially away from the only minimum of the free energy density describing the system .",
    "much of the formalism required for this has already been done in @xcite but we will extend that calculation to the overdamped regime . in an upcoming paper ,",
    "we plan to study the symmetry broken case .    to our knowledge",
    ", this paper is the first study of overdamping in quantum field theory with realistic couplings between system and environment , as inspired by particle physics .",
    "overdamping has been studied in quantum mechanical reaction rate theory for a particle escaping from a metastable state ( for a review please see @xcite ) .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as the kramer s problem , with the overdamped limit also called the smoluchowski limit .",
    "quantum mechanical models describing this problem are commonly of the system - heat bath type .",
    "microscopic quantum mechanical models have been constructed along these lines , in which the particle ( system ) is coupled to a set of otherwise free harmonic oscillators ( heat bath ) .",
    "such microscopic system - heat bath models are often referred to as caldeira - leggett ( cl ) models . in many cases they",
    "have been exactly solved @xcite .",
    "the overdamped limit has been derived in these models for the case where the coupling is linear with respect to the oscillator variables but arbitrary with respect to the particle variable @xcite .",
    "a caldeira - leggett type model has also been formulated for the case where the system is a self interacting scalar quantum field coupled linearly to a set of otherwise free fields and the overdamped limit has been obtained @xcite .",
    "this model does provide a microscopic quantum mechanical realization of time - dependent ginzburg - landau dynamics in scalar quantum field theory .",
    "however , since the couplings between system and environment variables are linear , it should be considered as a first step toward more realistic treatments .",
    "more importantly , the calculational method used in @xcite can not be extended to the case when the system variable couples quadratically to other fields .",
    "although the analysis of overdamping in this paper has general applicability , it was motivated by the warm inflation scenario of the early universe @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was realized that the standard higgs symmetry breaking scenario , when put into a cosmological setting , provides suitable conditions for the universe to enter a de sitter expansion phase and then smoothly exit into a radiation dominated phase .",
    "the overdamped motion of the order parameter in this scenario may sustain the vacuum energy sufficiently long for de sitter expansion to solve the horizon and flatness problems .",
    "simultaneously , the relaxational kinetics of the order parameter can maintain the temperature of the universe and permit a smooth exit from the de sitter phase into the radiation dominated phase .",
    "finally , the thermal fluctuations of the order parameter provide the initial seeds of density perturbations , which in addition could be scale free under specified conditions @xcite .",
    "an elementary analysis of this scenario , based on friedmann cosmology for general realizations of order parameter kinematics , indicated that if the universe s temperature does not fall too much during de sitter expansion , then the cosmological expansion factor from the de sitter phase should be of order the lower bound set by observation @xcite .",
    "although this is not a tight constraint of this scenario , it is a natural one .",
    "an analysis of cobe data motivated by this expectation did indicate a slight preference for a small super - hubble suppression scale , which could be interpreted as arising from a de sitter expansion with duration near its lower bound @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the overdamped limit required by warm inflation , when expressed in different terms , was noted @xcite to be an adiabatic limit , for which known methods from dissipative quantum field theory @xcite are presumed valid .",
    "these facts provide further motivation to seek a microscopic model of the scenario , which is the goal of the present work .",
    "the calculational methods used here , based on schwinger s close - time path formalism , were developed in @xcite .",
    "there are several other works in the literature that apply this formalism to a variety of different situations .",
    "[ see , for example , the works of refs . @xcite . ]",
    "the new feature of the present paper is to shift focus to a kinematic regime dominated by strong dissipation , in order to establish under which conditions this regime leads to overdamped motion .",
    "this approach will allow us to have a unique understanding of the microphysical origin of such dynamical behavior , which is in general invoked phenomenologically in applications ranging from condensed matter physics to inflationary cosmology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii our model of interacting bosons is presented and the effective action is computed perturbatively for a homogeneous time dependent background field configuration @xmath7 . in sec .",
    "iii the effective langevin - like equation of motion is obtained for @xmath0 in the symmetry - restored phase . in sec .",
    "iv the overdamped limit of this equation of motion is derived and regions of validity are given . in sec .",
    "v the results of the previous sections , which are for minkowski space , are extrapolated into a cosmological setting and a preliminary examination is made of the warm inflation scenario . in sec .",
    "vi concluding remarks are given .",
    "two appendixes are included to clarify a few technical details , like the evaluation of the imaginary part of the self - energies and to stress the importance of taking fully - dressed field propagators to properly describe dissipation in the adiabatic approximation for the field configuration .",

    "in particular , particle lifetimes are crucial in the study of relaxation time - scales in quantum many - body theory @xcite .",
    "also , the reason why we can get dissipation within our approach can be traced back to the very way that transport coefficients are derived in quantum field theory . as we will show later ,",
