    "1998 , frye et al . 1999 ) and infrared observation using hst @xcite have identified both of the flat spectrum radio cores .",
    "recently , the eso + new technology telescope(ntt ) near infra - red spectra show clear detections of both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 emission lines , implying a source redshift of @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "pks  1830 - 211 was observed using the vlba at 43  ghz at eight separate epochs , over a period of 14 weeks ( 1997 + january 19 - 1997 april 30 ) .",
    "the source was observed for a total of 5 hours at each epoch . and each epoch was + separated in time by about 14 days .",
    "for all observations right and left hands of polarisation were recorded in 2-bit mode , each with a total bandwidth of 32 mhz , divided + into 4 if channels . several nearby and compact calibrators ( b  1730 - 130 , b  1749 + 096 , b  1741 - 038 , and b  1908 - 211 )",
    "were observed every 18 minutes - at the beginning and end of each 22 minute tape pass .",
    "both parallel and cross - hand polarisation products were generated by the nrao vlba correlator in socorro , nm , usa . only one processing centre was + employed , positioned mid - way between the ne and sw + images . in order to avoid the effects of time smearing ,",
    "very short integrations times were provided by the correlator ( 0.39 s ) .",
    "the data quality was generally good except for the sixth epoch ( 1997 april 3 ) which was adversely affected by bad weather at kitt peak , excessive noise and resulting weak fringes at brewster and bad playback at fort davis ( for some but not all if channels ) .",
    "nevertheless , the data for the sixth epoch were still reasonable after appropriate + editing of the data .",
    "initial calibration of the data was + performed with the aips package .",
    "the visibility amplitudes were calibrated using the system temperatures and gain + information provided by each telescope .",
    "residual delays and fringe rates associated with instrumental effects were + determined from the calibrators and removed from the + target source data ( pks  1830 - 211 ) .",
    "hybrid mapping of the calibrators also generated antenna based amplitude gain + corrections and these were also applied and interpolated to pks  1830 - 211 .",
    "the instrumental polarisation calibration was derived from the compact calibrators ( following + leppnen et al . , 1995 ) and applied to pks  1830 - 211 .",
    "the polarization angle was not calibrated , since we were more + interested in a comparison of the polarization intensity and angle between the two lensed images which did nt require any absolute angle to be determined .",
    "at all eight epochs , the d - terms ( so - called _ leakage factors _ ) solved are about + 4 - 8  % for br , hn and la and less than 5  % for the other seven antennas in the vlba array .",
    "large residual rates associated with atmospheric + instabilities remained in the target data and this + necessitated fringe - fitting pks  1830 - 211 directly .",

    "each of these core and jet components was fitted by a single elliptical gaussian component using aips task imfit except for the much weaker `` jet '' on the ne image at the 6th epoch , where the low flux density prevents reasonable model - fitting .",

    ", @xmath13as ( ra ) and @xmath14as ( dec ) , relative to the sw core .",
    "we plot deviations from this nominal separation ( also relative to the sw core ) for each epoch .",
    "we have also included the previous observation ( 01:30-may-1996 ) in this figure .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the relative separation + between the images of the core changes with epoch .",
    "the largest overall deviation of up to 142 @xmath0as occurs at the 8th epoch ( 1997 april 30 ) .",
    "the largest deviation measured + between successive epochs is 87 @xmath0as ( epochs 4 and 5 ) .",
    "a comparison of the nominal separation of the ne and sw core images with previous 43  ghz vlba observation @xcite made @xmath15 months earlier show even larger deviations of 201 @xmath0as .",
    "we have considered several possible _ extrinsic _ + explanations for this observed change in the angular + separation of the images .",
    "these include : induced shifts in the centroids of the core brightness distribution due to + milli - lensing by massive ( @xmath16 ) compact objects in the halo of the lens @xcite ; and the relative proper motion between the ne and sw images caused by the transverse velocity of the lens galaxy across the sky @xcite , though the image separation does not necesarily change with changing source position .",
    "however , neither of these effects can reproduce the magnitude of the measured deviations on either the + shortest ( a few weeks ) or longest time scales ( 11 months ) considered here . in addition , the effect of `` image wander''- an apparent shift in the position of a source caused by + galactic scattering @xcite , also seems to be an unlikely explanation for the changing image separations at this frequency .",
    "in particular , the sw deconvolved core size of @xmath17  mas at 1.3 cm @xcite and our + measurement of @xmath18  mas at 7 mm scales + almost linearly with @xmath19 as expected from simple models of synchrotron radio emission .",
    "a @xmath20 law would be expected in the case of iss ( indeed this is observed at longer cm wavelengths @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the + measured source size is dominated by its internal radio structure , and that any interstellar scattering effects are rather weak at @xmath19  7  mm .",
    "we believe that the most likely explanation for the changing image separation involves continuous changes in the brightness distribution of the background radio source on relatively short - time scales ( considerably shorter than that usually probed by vlbi ) .",
    "as the centroid of the + radio emission of the background radio source moves within the source plane , the separation of the images changes . in + addition , the position of one image lags behind the other ( the motions being separated by the time - delay ) .",
    "the changes in the measured angular separation are a combination of both effects .    for a frw universe ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , h@xmath23 ) , the shift of @xmath24 80 @xmath0as ( the largest shift + between successive epochs separated by 16 days ) + corresponds to a linear distance of @xmath24 0.45  pc at @xmath5 . even if one takes into account the magnification provided by the lens ( a factor of @xmath25 according to @xcite@xcite ) , a shift of 80 @xmath0 scales to @xmath24 0.14 pc , thus implying ( unlensed ) superluminal + velocities in the rest frame of the background source in + excess of 10  @xmath26 . given the blazar nature of the background source , and the apparently chaotic structure surrounding the cores at 43 ghz @xcite which implies the radio jet in 1830 - 211 is well beamed towards us , the measured superluminal velocity of 10  @xmath26 might be expected .",
    "another egret source 1156 + 295 @xcite , which is probably similar to the background source of 1830 , also showed superluminal velocity of several c @xcite , but across 10 epochs spanning a period of 8 years .",
    "the detection of source evolution in 1830 on these short time - scale of several weeks would be impossible if it were not for the fact that this is a lensed system which provides us with a magnified view and closely spaced multiple images that allow accurate relative position measurements to be made .",
    "( 40,40 ) ( 0,170 )        based on flux density ratio arguments , we can directly + relate the `` core '' and the `` jet '' in one image to that in the other image .",
    "in addition , we also note that both images are also weakly polarised , with the position of the polarised + emission being significantly offset from the position of the total intensity core emission .",
    "we therefore identify two + vectors in each lensed , that relates the brightness distribution of the sw image to that observed in the ne image .",
    "( 200,110 ) ( -180,210 )    ( 80,210 )    figure  [ fig4 ] shows the vectors corresponding to the positions of the `` jet '' and the polarised peak with respect to the `` core '' .",
    "both of the vectors vary through the 8 epochs of + observation but the changes are not obviously systematic ( _ e.g. _ there is no clear , linear proper motion of the secondary component with respect to the core ) .",
    "we have determined the error - weighted averages for these quantities over all + epochs of observation .",
    "since there is a measured time - delay of @xmath8 @xcite days , we have exclude the first two epochs of the sw image and the last two epochs of the ne image in the averaging process .",
    "the uncertainty of each + averaged vector is estimated from the scattering of the + vector through the epochs .    using these data we estimate @xmath27 :    @xmath28    the errors ( 1@xmath29 )",
    "are estimated from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the determinant of the matrix is : @xmath30 ( 1@xmath29 ) .",
    "the sign of the determinant indicates the two images have opposite parities as predicted by lens models of the system .",
    "the magnitude of determinant is consistent with lovell + et al.s measurement for the flux density ratio ( ne : sw ) of @xmath10 , and our own measurements through the 8 epochs of observation , presented in fig  [ fig3 ] . the ratio ( ne : sw ) changes with epoch , ranging from 1.1 to 1.4 , in good agreement with the determinant of the matrix + ( determined purely from positional information only ) .",
    "the changes of the ratio are most likely due to intrinsic brightness changes in the background radio source combined with the time - delay between the images ( changes in the sw + image lag behind the ne image by 3 - 4 weeks ) .",
    "we have applied our matrix to previous vlba 15  ghz + observations of pks  1830 - 211 @xcite .",
    "we find that the peak of the faint extended component that lies + approximately ( -5.0,5.0)mas to the north - west of the 15  ghz sw core , maps to ( 13.8 , -6.1)mas to the sourth - east of the ne core in the ne image with an uncertainty of 2.2 mas(1@xmath29 ) .",
    "this overlaps with the extended component that lies + approximately 13 mas to the south - east of the 15  ghz ne core .",
    "given that the positions of these faint components are not very well defined ( due to their extended nature ) , this close correspondence strongly suggests that these features are associated , multiply - lensed emission .",
    "our new matrix _ can not _",
    ", however , explain the fact that the prominent 10-mas - long jet , clearly seen emerging from the core of the ne image at 15  ghz in a north - westerly + direction , has no obvious counterpart in the sw image .",
    "the matrix predicts that the position of the hot - spot at the tip of the jet , approximately 10 mas to the north - west of the ne core , should map on to a region located 5 mas to the south - east of the sw core with an uncertainty of tens of mas(1@xmath29 ) .",
    "this large positional uncertainty makes it difficult to identify the jet s counterpart in the sw image .",
    "even if we ignore this large uncertainty , such emission , including the rest of the extended jet , should have been easily detectable at 15  ghz and 8.4  ghz .",
    "nair & garrett have recently + attempted to explain the apparently singular jet in the ne image as a perturbation in the lens potential probed by that image . in their model nair and",
    "garrett argue that this perturbation arises from sub - structure in the lens e.g. the chance alignment of the ne radio image with a massive discrete structure , such as a globular cluster in the lens galaxy .      since the vlba observations at 43  ghz were severely + affected by the atmospheric opacity effect , so the absolute flux density scale in table  [ table1 ] varied between one epoch and another .",
    "thus it is not possible to get meaningful light curves from the fluxes presented in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "however , + taking the data from table  [ table1 ] , we have considered various flux density ratios in the two images .",
    "the core - jet flux + density ratio and the fractional polarisation of the two + images change with epoch , but neither of these two ratios show obvious correlation after the time - delay of @xmath9 days has been compensated for . the jet components in the two images",
    "are normally more extended , thus making their flux density estimates less accurate than that of the core components .",
    "if the source has detailed polarisation structure that can not be resolved by the vlbi array , the polarisation flux density measurement will also have large errors . in the light of the above , the results obtained are not surprising .",
    "we have presented eight - epoch , 43  ghz , dual - polarisation vlba observations of the gravitational lens system , pks 1830 - 211 . ``",
    "core - jet '' structure was clearly seen in both lensed images at all epochs .",
    "the position of the polarised intensity emission is observed to be offset from the peak of total intensity maps .",
    "the offset is about one third of the synthesised beam and is observed at all eight epochs and in both images .    the relative separation between the `` core '' centroid positions of the two lensed images changes by up to 87 @xmath0as between subsequent epochs .",
    "a comparison of these recent + separation measurements with previous 43  ghz + observations @xcite shows even larger deviations of up to 201 @xmath0as over a period of 27 weeks .",
    "the measured changes are most likely produced by evolution in the brightness distribution of the background source , enhanced by the magnification of the lens .",
    "the multi - component core - jet radio structure observed in both images , together with the spatial offset between the polarised and total intensity core emission , permit us to + estimate a relative magnification matrix for this system .",
    "the determinant of the matrix is @xmath30 , in good agreement with the flux density ratio of the images .",
    "the matrix presented here can be an important input for the construction of realistic lens models for this system and thus associated estimates of @xmath31 .",
    "application of this matrix to previous vlbi observations meets with mixed success . in one case",
    "it is reasonably successful in relating a faint extended component observed in each of the ne and sw images at 15  ghz .",
    "however , it also predicts that the extremely prominent 10-mas - long jet associated with the 15  ghz ne image , should be easily detected in the sw image .",
    "the fact that the high quality 15 ghz and 8.4 ghz vlba observations ( garrett et al .",
    "1997 , guirado et al .",
    "1999 ) do not detect such a jet , provides strong evidence for sub - structure in the lens .",
