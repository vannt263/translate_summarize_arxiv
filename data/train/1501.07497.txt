    "in recent years , the magnetic and transport properties of ce - based ternary compounds of type cet@xmath0al@xmath1 ( t = fe , ru and os ) , which crystalline in the orthorhombic structure ( space group no 63 cmcm )  @xcite , have generated strong interest in both theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "this interest arose due to the various ground states observed in this family of ce - compounds .",
    "an unusually sharp phase transition near 27 k in the magnetic susceptibility of ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 has been attributed to a spin - dimer formation  @xcite .",
    "the resistivity of ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 exhibits a sharp drop near 27 k resembling an insulator - metal transition  @xcite .",
    "a very similar phase transition , near 29 k , has been observed in ceos@xmath0al@xmath1  @xcite , but in this compound the susceptibility ( along the @xmath13axis ) exhibits a broad maximum near 45 k in contrast to a sharp drop at the phase transition ( 27 k ) in ceru@xmath0al@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the broad maximum in the susceptibility and its strong anisotropic behavior in the paramagnetic state reveal the presence of strong hybridization between 4@xmath14 and conduction electrons as well as strong single ion anisotropy arising from the crystal field potential  @xcite .",
    "further difference between the two systems appears in the resistivity of the ordered state ; the resistivity of ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 displays a thermal activation - type temperature dependence below 15 k while the resistivity of ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 exhibits a metallic behavior below the phase transition down to 2 k. in spite of the comparable transition temperatures a fundamental contrast in the electronic disposition of the two compounds has been exposed in recent high - pressure studies  @xcite . under a hydrostatic pressure of 1.75 gpa the electrical resistivity of ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 changes in a way as closely to match the overall behavior of the temperature dependent resistivity of ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 in zero applied pressure . applying pressure is a well recognized tuning method of the 4@xmath15 band with respect to the fermi energy ( e@xmath16 ) in narrow - band systems .",
    "the results obtained for the two iso - electronic compounds are therefore an indication that the center of gravity of the 4@xmath15band is lying on opposite sides of the e@xmath16 : the 4@xmath15 spectral weight in ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 is most likely close to but below the e@xmath16 whereas in ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 , the 4@xmath14 band is most likely above the e@xmath16 due to the more extended nature of the 5@xmath17 band of os compared to the 4@xmath17 band of ru .",
    "the 3@xmath17 transition metal compound cefe@xmath0al@xmath1 exhibits kondo insulating behavior with a transport@xmath3derived gap of 15 k  @xcite , while an nmr study reveals a much larger value of the gap , namely 110 k  @xcite .",
    "neutron diffraction studies of cet@xmath0al@xmath1 ( t = ru and os ) reveal a very small ordered moments , 0.34 @xmath4 and 0.29 @xmath4 , respectively , along the @xmath5axis , which is not the direction expected from the single ion crystal field ( cef ) anisotropy  @xcite . as the single ion crystal field would prefer the moment along the @xmath13axis in both compounds , this indicates that the moment direction in these compounds is governed by the anisotropic magnetic exchange and not by the cef anisotropy .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) study at 4.5 k on the polycrystalline samples of cet@xmath0al@xmath1 ( t = ru , os and fe ) reveals a clear sign of a spin - gap formation of 8 mev , 11 mev and 12 mev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "these gaps are nearly temperature independent up to 24 k , but disappear suddenly at 27 k , 39 k and 75 k respectively  @xcite . above these temperatures , the ins response becomes very broad , of quasi - elastic - type .",
    "very recently inelastic neutron scattering investigation on single crystals of ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 , ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 and cefe@xmath0al@xmath1 have been performed  @xcite .",
    "well defined gapped spin waves are observed in ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 and ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 that can well be explained by anisotropic exchange interactions . even in the paramagnetic state of cefe@xmath0al@xmath1",
    "( no magnetic ordering observed down to 50 mk ) the neutron study reveals a dispersive gapped magnetic excitations having the same propagation vector @xmath18 = ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) as observed in ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 , suggesting that these magnetic excitations in the kondo insulating state have some connection to the spin wave observed in the magnetically ordered state of cet@xmath0al@xmath1 ( t = ru and os )  @xcite .    the effects of electron ( ir / rh ) and hole ( re ) doping on the transition metal site in cet@xmath0al@xmath1 ( t = ru and os ) have been investigated , through magnetization , resistivity , muon spin rotation ( @xmath11sr ) , and neutron scattering ( both elastic and inelastic )  @xcite .",
    "these studies show the general trend that the hybridization between 4@xmath15electrons and conduction electrons increases with hole - doping , while the ce-4@xmath14 electrons become more localized with electron - doping . on hole - doping",
    "the spin gap and the antiferromagnetic order with an anomalous direction of the magnetic moment ( i.e. moment either along @xmath5axis or @xmath8axis ) not governed by the single ion crystal field anisotropy ( this prefers moment along @xmath13axis ) survive with small ordered state moments of 0.18@xmath30.23@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , electron doping destabilizes the spin gap formation and the antiferromagnetic ordering becomes normal with moment directions along the @xmath13axis e.g. governed by the single ion anisotropy , and larger values of the ordered state moment , @xmath19 1 @xmath4  @xcite .",

    "@xcite suggested that the phase transition at @xmath2 is not due to simple rkky interactions as it is not possible to describe the behavior of ce@xmath6gd@xmath7ru@xmath0al@xmath1 and ce(fe@xmath6ru@xmath7)@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath2 is suppressed by the application of a magnetic field as well as by la substitution on the ce site in ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 . considering these interesting observations  @xcite found with electron and hole doped ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 and ceos@xmath0al@xmath1",
    ", it is timely to investigate the effect of chemical pressure ( la or y doping ) on the ce site in cet@xmath0al@xmath1 ( t = ru and os ) using microscopic techniques such as neutron diffraction , inelastic neutron scattering and @xmath11sr measurements .",
    "we therefore present in this paper our results of such measurements on la - substituted ce@xmath6la@xmath7t@xmath0al@xmath1 ( t = ru and os ) to shed light on the nature of the phase transition and the ground state of the ce ion in these compounds .",
    "our study is motivated by the highly unusual magnetic ordering in the ru and os compounds of the cet@xmath0al@xmath1 series , with questions about the enigmatic behavior first posed by nishioka _ et .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the special class of kondo insulator materials , the ru and os compounds are to date the only cases where such a strongly hybridized and unstable @xmath15shell condenses into a long - range magnetic ordered ground state .",
    "the effect of la and y substitution on the parent compound ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 has been investigated before by three groups by studying magnetic and transport properties  @xcite .",
    "la ( y ) has a bigger ( smaller ) ionic radius compared to ce and hence la substitution expands the lattice corresponding to negative chemical pressure and y substitution contracts the lattice corresponding to that to positive chemical pressure .",
    "the results are interesting but unexpected  @xcite . with increasing la concentration x in ce@xmath6la@xmath7ru@xmath0al@xmath1",
    ", the transition temperature is progressively shifting to lower temperature and vanishes near the critical composition @xmath20 @xmath19 0.7  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly y@xmath3substitution leads as well to a decrease of @xmath2 rather than to an increase as one would expect for positive chemical pressure , and disappears suddenly between @xmath12 = 0.4 and 0.5  @xcite .",
    "this behavior can not be understood by a simple magnetic phase transition , suggesting that the change in the valence of ce ion plays an important role in the mysterious phase transition  @xcite .",

    "@xcite revealed that the long - range order disappears at a critical fields @xmath21 = 50 and 37 t for @xmath12 = 0 and 0.25 , respectively .    from the single crystal susceptibility measurements",
    "tanida _ et .",
    "al . _ have proposed that 10% la doping in ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 changes the direction of the ordered state moment from the @xmath5axis found in undoped system to the @xmath8axis , the hard axis of magnetization .",
    "application of a pressure of 0.3 gpa changes the moment back to the @xmath5axis  @xcite . however , magnetic susceptibility data can only give indirect information on the ordered state moment direction and can be erroneous if anisotropic exchange interactions are dominating over the single ion crystal field anisotropy .",
    "they can not give a direct measure of the value of the ordered state moment .",
    "the unanswered question remains what is happening to the spin gap formation and its energy scale as the direction of the ordered state moment of ce@xmath9la@xmath10ru@xmath0al@xmath1 changes to the @xmath8axis from the @xmath5axis as in ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 . in order to answer these questions",
    "we have carried out neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on ce@xmath9la@xmath10ru@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "the neutron diffraction study provides direct information on the direction as on the magnitude of the ordered moment .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering gives direct information about the magnitude of the spin - gap energy , its temperature and wave - vector ( q ) dependency .    in order to gain further information on the microscopic change in the magnetism we have performed muon spin rotation measurements on ce@xmath6la@xmath7ru@xmath0al@xmath1 ( @xmath12 = 0 , 0.3 , 0.5 and 0.7 ) alloys",
    "@xmath11sr is an exceptionally sensitive microscopic probe of cooperative magnetic ordering phenomena and is thus ideally suited to our compounds where previous studied had alluded very small magnetic moment values .",
    "our neutron diffraction study reveals a long@xmath3range magnetically ordered ground state in both ce@xmath9la@xmath10ru@xmath0al@xmath1 and ce@xmath9la@xmath10os@xmath0al@xmath1 compounds . more interestingly",

    "we have carried out a comprehensive study on ce@xmath9la@xmath10t@xmath0al@xmath1 ( t = ru and os ) using the complementary techniques of magnetization , resistivity , heat capacity , neutron diffraction , inelastic neutron scattering and muon spin relaxation measurements to understand the unusual behavior of the magnetic moment direction and the opening of a spin gap below @xmath2 .",
    "the neutron diffraction study is unambiguous in confirming the long - range magnetic order in this compound .",
    "more interestingly our nd study shows a very small ordered moment of 0.18 @xmath4 along the @xmath8axis in ce@xmath9la@xmath10ru@xmath0al@xmath1 , but a moment of 0.23 @xmath11b along the @xmath5axis in ce@xmath9la@xmath10os@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "this contrasting behavior can be explained based on a different degree of hybridization in ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 and ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 : hybridization is stronger in the latter than in the former .",
    "our ins study reveals the presence of a spin gap of 7 mev and 10 mev in the 10% la - doped t = ru and os compounds , respectively .",
    "interestingly the intensity of the spin gap decreases dramatically in la - doped ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 compound .",
    "further we also present muon spin rotation study on ce@xmath6la@xmath7ru@xmath0al@xmath1 ( @xmath12 = 0 , 0.3 , 0.5 and 0.7 ) , which reveals the presence of two coherent frequency oscillations indicating a long@xmath3range magnetic ground state in @xmath12 = 0 to 0.5 , but almost temperature independent kubo - toyabe response between 45 mk and 4 k for @xmath12 = 0.7 .",
    "the absence of temperature dependent relaxation rate in @xmath12 = 0.7 despite of the logarithmic rise in the heat capacity down to mk is an unusual behavior .",
    "one would expect that near a quantum phase transition , @xmath11sr will sense the presence of quantum fluctuations even in the paramagnetic nfl state .",
    "these @xmath11sr results are very similar to that observed in yfe@xmath0al@xmath1 , where despite of nfl behavior observed in the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity , the @xmath11sr spectra  @xcite are independent of temperature down to mk . a major achievement of this work has been the finding of frequency oscillations in our @xmath11sr spectra up to @xmath12 = 0.5 , which for the first time establishes the onset of long - range magnetic ordering in the la - doped compounds and the robust magnetic ordering in spite of the large and anisotropic @xmath23 hybridization in this system .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath11sr frequencies and muon depolarization rates of @xmath12 = 0 follow an unusual behavior with further cooling of the sample below 18 k , pointing at the possibility of another phase transition below 15 k. on the other hand the temperature dependence of the @xmath11sr frequencies and muon depolarization rates of @xmath12 = 0.3 follows conventional behavior expected for a second order phase transition in the mean field theory .",
