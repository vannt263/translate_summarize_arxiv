    "ad hoc_. however , as is ultimately required by hadron phenomenology , the physical qcd vacuum is characterised by finite nonzero gluon condensates @xcite , among which the lowest order condensate can be related to a mean action density times the coupling constant squared @xcite , @xmath12 which can be provided only by the class of configurations already excluded from eq.([fourier ] ) , the field configurations with extensive ( scaling with the volume @xmath13 ) classical action .",
    "one faces the necessity of defining the qcd partition function as an integral over the space @xmath14 of gluon configurations @xmath15 which are allowed to have nonzero classical action density at space - time infinity .",
    "for instance a suitable requirement for @xmath14 would be @xmath16 with a nonzero constant on the rhs , which can be related to the trace anomaly of the qcd energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "condition eq .",
    "( [ newspace ] ) produces no essential difficulties since the infinity arising from the volume of the system is simply a matter of normalisation of the functional integral , or put differently , of normalisation of the vacuum energy .",
    "the actual values of the gluon condensates and the constant on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ newspace ] ) are defined by the minima of the quantum effective action .",
    "this indicates that the properties of the qcd physical vacuum , which are encoded in the various condensates and are responsible for confinement and the mode of realisation of chiral symmetry , are due to purely quantum effects .",
    "consequently , the fields to be identified as dominating the qcd functional integral must not have vanishing action density at infinity , otherwise the main effect , the existence of condensates , would be omitted . in order to define the functional integral over fields subject to eq .",
    "( [ meanaction ] ) in an analytical approach one can represent @xmath17 with the background @xmath18 from the class of fields dominating the integral and @xmath6 being small localised fluctuations in this background .",
    "the integral over fields @xmath18 has to be performed exactly , while fluctuations @xmath6 can be treated perturbatively .",
    "the candidate dominating fields @xmath19 could be required to satisfy another condition for almost all @xmath20 @xmath21 which , and this is important , neither forbids space - time variation of the strength tensor and the fields @xmath19 nor devalues the importance of topological ( singular ) pure gauge field defects of various dimensions distributed throughout the entire euclidean space - time @xcite .",

    "however , despite diluteness , any superposition of an infinite number ( in the infinite volume ) of instantons and anti - instantons represents a field with infinite classical action , which can be different from the class fixed by eq .",
    "( [ background ] ) , but for sure is absent in the space of integration @xmath22 subject to eq .",
    "( [ action1 ] ) .",
    "( [ meanaction ] ) has an important consequence : in the space of fields @xmath22 with extensive classical action the functional @xmath23 $ ] can take any real value , rational or irrational , finite or infinite in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "this signals that the equivalence classes fed into the representation eq.([fourier ] ) do not exist in the space @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , the notion of the mean value of the modulus @xmath25|$ ] @xmath26|\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is well - defined on @xmath22 and , as is known from phenomenology and lattice qcd , is a nonzero constant , related to the topological susceptibility @xmath27 of the qcd vacuum @xcite . in both cases of fields satisfying eq .",
    "( [ background ] ) and dilute superpositions of instantons , @xmath28 can be expressed in terms of a mean action density .",
    "there is a crucial difference however between instanton based approximations of the fields with infinite action and backgrounds ( as in the domain model for instance  @xcite ) based on eq .",
    "( [ background ] ) .",
    "the literal use of instantons to approximate fields with infinite action assigns integer values of topological charge to the fields from @xmath22 and thus transports integer units @xmath11 of topological charge from eq .",

    "( [ fourier ] ) , and that incorporation of the long - range gluon configurations responsible for confinement could potentially remove this problem .",
    "however to date no way has been found to achieve this and maintain simultaneously the resolution of the @xmath29 problem traditionally attributed to instantons .",
    "scenarios based on the existence of an additional boson , the axion , have been suggested and have become canonical  ( @xcite ) .    nevertheless , as will be discussed below in detail on the basis of a qcd motivated model , and as has been proposed in @xcite within the general model independent consideration",
    ", the strong cp and @xmath4 problems have a mechanism for simultaneous resolution within qcd .",
    "as is stressed in @xcite , the order of thermodynamic limit and the limit @xmath30 are in general not interchangeable and thus independence with respect to @xmath2 of the infinite volume qcd partition function of qcd does not automatically lead to vanishing topological succeptibility @xmath31 .",
    "the qcd motivated model we shall consider in this article is the domain model @xcite . for completeness and clear identification of the origin of the effect discussed in this article a comment about",
    "the choice of boundary conditions in the domain model is in order .",
    "the field @xmath18 is considered as a background field and is subject to the condition eq.([background ] ) .",
    "the system is considered in a large but finite volume @xmath13 .",
    "the total volume is split into a large number of subvolumes  domains .",
    "the fluctuation quark fields are defined by the bag - like conditions on the domain boundaries .",
    "the characteristic size of a domain is much smaller than the characteristic size of the total volume .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is understood as the limit when the size of the total volume goes to infinity together with the number of domains while the size of domains stays finite .",
    "this construction is sufficient for defining and for practical calculation of the euclidean functional integral for the partition function .",
    "it should be stressed that bag - like conditions are very different from the ( quasi-)periodic conditions typical for formulations based on a compactification of @xmath32 to the torus .",
    "the most important feature for our considerations is that the spectrum @xmath33 of the dirac operator under bag - like boundary conditions is asymmetric with respect to @xmath34 , while ( quasi-)periodic boundary conditions lead to a symmetric spectrum .",
    "in particular , this asymmetry is responsible for the formation of the quark condensate and resolution of the @xmath35 problem in the model as is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is no contradiction between our results and canonical considerations based on torus - like compactifications of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "these are just two different complementary statements of the problem .    within the domain model the mechanism for resolving",
    "the strong cp - problem is realised in the following way . in the presence of nonzero",
    "gluon condensates irrational values of @xmath28 are permitted and lead to a realisation of cp in which the set of critical values of the @xmath2 parameter for which the cp - breaking is spontaneous @xcite is _ dense _ in the interval @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "as a consequence , the infinite volume partition function with infinitesimally small quark masses @xmath37 is independent of @xmath2 , and @xmath38 for any cp - even and cp - odd operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , which resolves the problem of cp - violation .",
    "simultaneously one finds that topological succeptibility in qcd with massive quarks @xmath41 is nonzero , independent of @xmath2 , and satisfies the anomalous ward identity , which indicates a correct implementation of the @xmath35 symmetry .",
    "in particular , in the chiral limit the mass of the @xmath42 is expressed via the topological succeptibility @xmath43 of pure gluodynamics in agreement with the witten - veneziano formula .",
    "if @xmath28 takes a rational value then only a finite number of such critical points exist in the interval @xmath44 $ ] , which results in the standard strong cp problem .",
    "to apply a mechanical analogy , an irrational value of @xmath28 leads to a picture which is reminiscent of ergodic motion resulting in a dense winding of a torus by a trajectory @xcite , while motion over closed trajectories can be associated with rational @xmath28 .",
    "this article is devoted to an investigation of this mechanism on the basis of the domain model of qcd vacuum  @xcite .",
    "we omit here all details related to the motivation , formulation and numerous results of the model given in the above papers , apart from those which are specifically needed here . in the next two sections the @xmath2 dependence in the model under consideration is elucidated . the witten - veneziano mass formula , gell - mann  oakes  renner relation , the anomalous ward identity and @xmath45 decay",
    "are specifically discussed in section  [ massrel ] .",
    "the final section is devoted to explanation of the relation between the mechanism of the strong cp resolution in the domain model and the poincar recurrence theorem of ergodic theory which justifies the title of the present paper .",

    "( [ background ] ) .    in a sense , this model represents a `` step - function '' approximation to a class of fields with infinite action which are assumed to dominate the qcd partition function .",
    "the building blocks of this approximation are domains with the same mean size @xmath47 and mean action density @xmath70 , whose values are determined from the phenomenological string tension in @xcite .",
    "moreover as the field in domains is taken to be ( anti)-self - dual , a mean absolute value @xmath1 of the integral of the topological charge density over the domain volume @xmath71 is attributed to a domain , and is expressed through the domain radius and field strength as @xmath72 .",
    "this quantity can take any real values but for @xmath73 fixed as in @xcite @xmath74 .",
    "it should be noted also that domain boundaries are assumed to be populated by pure gauge singularities which look like topological defects ( instantons , monopoles , vortices and domain walls ) but only locally ; globally no topologically conserved number can be associated with them .",
    "the role of these defects in the model is to generate boundary conditions for the fluctuations of gluon and quark fields @xmath6 and @xmath75 inside domains  @xcite . in particular , at the location of pure gauge singularities @xmath76 colour quark currents have to satisfy the condition @xmath77 with @xmath78 being a vector normal to the surface @xmath76 of the @xmath79th domain where the singularities are located .",
