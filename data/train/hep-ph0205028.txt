    "the nuclear medium effects on meson properties are interesting and have been investigated extensively .",
    "the data from relativistic heavy ion collision at cern @xcite and at lower energies at bevalac @xcite , may indicate either a lowering of the @xmath5 meson mass or a large broadening of its width . in the near future , experiments at gsi(hades collaboration @xcite ) could clarify the situation by providing better statistics and mass resolution .",
    "the recent discovery of the deeply bound state of @xmath6 in pb @xcite reveals an upward shift of the pion mass of about 20 mev , and confirms the repulsive s - wave interaction of the @xmath6 in nuclear matter already established from studies of the bulk pionic atom data @xcite .",
    "the low energy magnitudes of the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction and the properties of the @xmath0 meson in the medium , are still open questions .",
    "the @xmath0 mesic nuclei are expected to provide such informations and are searched at several facilities .",
    "for example , the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions are investigated at gsi @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the properties of the @xmath0 in the medium from a theoretical point of view .",
    "we evaluate the effective s - wave @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction in the medium in a chiral unitary approach .",
    "the self - energy of @xmath0 is obtained by summing the @xmath10 interaction in the medium over the nucleons in the fermi sea .",
    "the present work follows closely the method used in @xcite to evaluate the @xmath11 nucleus optical potential in a self - consistent way . in the next section",
    ", we explain our approach .",
    "we show our input related with the nuclear medium in section 3 .",
    "the results are given in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we want to obtain the self - energy of the @xmath0 meson in nuclear matter at various densities @xmath5 , as a function of the @xmath0 energy @xmath12 and the momentum @xmath13 in the nuclear matter frame . in this paper , we calculate it by means of @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the momentum of the neutron and the fermi momentum at density @xmath5 respectively , and @xmath17 is the @xmath0-neutron in - medium s - wave interaction , with the total 4-momentum of the system @xmath18 in the nuclear matter frame , namely @xmath19 and @xmath20 . here , the isospin symmetry , @xmath21 , is assumed and the amplitude is summed over nucleons in the fermi sea as shown in fig.[fig : etasw ] .",
    "we shall be concerned about the s - wave @xmath0 self - energy . at low energies of the @xmath0",
    "this part of the potential is largely dominant .",
    "= 35 mm    we evaluate the in - medium amplitude @xmath22 in a chiral unitary approach . for this purpose",
    "we follow the model for the free space @xmath2-@xmath1 and coupled channels scattering of ref.@xcite , which reproduces the experimental data of @xmath23 scattering up to energies above the @xmath3 region . a similar chiral approach which covers a wider energy range in isospin 1/2 , although with more free parameters , is also done in ref.@xcite .    in ref.@xcite the bethe - salpeter equation",
    "is considered with eight coupled channels including two @xmath24 states , namely \\{@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32}. the kernels for the meson - baryon two - body sector are taken from the lowest order chiral lagrangians and improved by applying a form factor corresponding to a vector meson exchange in the t - channel .",
    "the kernels for @xmath33 transitions are determined so that they account for both the @xmath23 elastic and @xmath34 processes .",
    "that model reproduces well the the @xmath23 scattering amplitudes , especially in isospin 1/2 , for the center of mass energy energies from threshold to 1600 mev .",
    "it reproduce also the @xmath35 cross section at the region where the p - wave contribution is negligible . in this coupled channels approach",
    ", the model also provides the @xmath0-@xmath36 interaction in free space and generates dynamically the @xmath3 resonance providing the width and branching ratios for its decay in good agreement with experiment , among them the @xmath10 branching ratio which is quite large for that resonance .",
    "the agreement of the model with the different available data around @xmath3 resonance region and the adequate description of the properties of the resonance , in particular the strong coupling to the @xmath10 state , give us confidence that the model is rather accurate to make predictions on the @xmath37 interaction .",
    "therefore we use this model as a base to take nuclear matter effects into account .",
    "= 30 mm    analogously to the free space case , @xmath17 is given by one matrix element of the matrix equation in the space of coupled channels @xmath38^{-1 }   v ( { \\sqrt s } ) \\label{eqn : bseq}\\ ] ] which is the solution of bethe - salpeter equation(fig.[fig : bseq ] ) , where the kernel matrix @xmath39 have been factorized on shell as shown in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite , and @xmath40 is a diagonal matrix of loop functions .",
    "the kernel has nothing to do with nuclear matter and does not depend on density and hence can be parameterized in terms of only the invariant energy @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "one can find the explicit form of it in ref.@xcite .",
    "the effects of the nuclear medium are taken into account through the loop functions @xmath43 , which describe the propagation of intermediate states in the medium .",
    "the meson baryon loop functions for the free space are given by the integral @xmath44 which is the zero density limit of the loop function in medium .",
    "the generalization to the case where the initial meson baryon system is not in the cm frame ( @xmath45 ) , is a necessity in order to evaluate the meson baryon amplitude for arbitrary meson and baryon momenta in the frame of nuclear matter at rest , where the @xmath0 self - energy is evaluated ( see eq.([eqn : selfint ] ) ) .",
    "we regularize the integral by means of a cut off rather than by dimensional regularization as done in ref.@xcite .",
    "the choice of a cut off is preferable when one performs the calculation in nuclear matter since lorentz covariance is manifestly broken given the fact that one has a privileged frame of reference , the one where nuclear matter is at rest .",
    "the integration variable @xmath46 is the momentum of the meson in the loop , but in order to obtain a lorentz invariant quantity when @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the limits in eq.([eqn : labint ] ) must be implemented in such a way that the meson momentum in the rest frame of the original meson baryon state , @xmath49 , should be smaller than the cut off taken .",
    "another possibility is of course to make a boost and work in the meson baryon cm frame which is the option followed in ref.@xcite .",
    "appropriate choices of the cut off and the subtraction constants(@xmath50 ) give the equivalent loop functions as in dimensional regularization ( see also ref.@xcite )",
    ". evaluating the integral in cm frame of the meson baryon system , we find that the choice @xmath51 gives meson baryon loop functions equivalent to those in our previous paper . in order to find @xmath52 which appears in eq.([eqn : bseq ] ) we shall use the formulation of eq.([eqn : labint ] ) and eq.([eqn : subconst ] ) in the free case but will take into account pauli blocking in the intermediate nucleon states , plus the meson and baryon self - energy in the intermediate states .",
    "the pauli blocking is one of the important nuclear matter effects .",
    "we incorporate this by replacing the free nucleon propagator as @xmath53 with the unit step function @xmath54 , which prevents the scattering to intermediate nucleon states below the fermi momentum .",
    "another important nuclear matter effect is the dressing of hadrons .",
    "all the baryons and mesons in the intermediate loops interact with nucleons of the fermi sea and their dispersion relations are changed .",
    "for the baryons , we incorporate this effect , within a mean - field approach , as a momentum - independent binding potential . due to baryon number conservation ,",
    "only the difference between the nucleon and hyperon potentials is relevant for our purpose and is introduced in the hyperon propagator in the kaon - hyperon loops .",
    "for the mesons , we incorporate the dressing effect by introducing the self - energy function @xmath55 .",
    "the meson propagators are replaced , using the lehmann representation , as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is meson spectral function given by @xmath58 }           { | ( q^0)^2 - { \\vec q\\,}^2 - m_l^2                    -\\pi_{l } ( q^0,\\vec q~;\\rho)|^2 } \\ ] ] as a function of energy and momentum in the nuclear matter frame .",
    "summarizing , the in - medium @xmath23 loop function , for example , is calculated by @xmath59 with @xmath60 \\vec p + \\vec q\\ ] ] from the lorentz boost .",
    "the 2-loop function needed for the @xmath61 channels is also modified in nuclear matter .",
    "we still take a zero constant for the real part according to our previous study in the free space @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary part is modified along the lines of @xmath62 and we obtain @xmath63     \\!\\!\\ ! & = & \\!\\!\\ !      -      \\int \\!\\ ! \\frac{d^3 \\vec",

    "we use commonly accepted values of baryon binding potentials which are @xmath65 mev for the nucleon and @xmath66 mev for the hyperons .",
    "hence , the difference @xmath67 mev is added to the hyperon energy @xmath68 in the hyperon propagator .",
    "the effective @xmath69-@xmath1 interaction in the medium is studied in ref.@xcite and the resulting kaon self - energy is @xmath70 approximately .",
    "we use this real constant self - energy for kaons in the kaon - hyperon loops .",
    "= 40 mm = 40 mm    the pion self - energy which we use in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 loops , consists of a p - wave term and an s - wave term as shown in fig.[fig : piself ] .",
    "the p - wave term includes n - h , @xmath71-h and @xmath72-h excitations , and is basically given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the lindhard functions corresponding to the above excitations respectively .",
    "for example , @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 \\label{eqn : unst}\\ ] ] @xmath79 where we use @xmath80 .",
    "this term is small compared to the @xmath81-h excitation term whose coupling is @xmath82 , but has a sizable contribution for energetic pions .",
    "the expression for @xmath83 is analogous to that in eq.([eqn : unst]-[eqn : defzdash ] ) and is given in ref.@xcite , the factor @xmath84 in eq.([eqn : unst ] ) is replaced by @xmath85 and the coupling , mass and width of the @xmath86 are replaced by the corresponding magnitudes for the @xmath81 . in the actual calculation we use the p - wave contribution eq.([eqn : pipw ] ) improving with a form factor , a short range correlation and a recoil factor as @xmath87 respectively , where @xmath88 is a monopole form factor with cutoff of 1.2 gev and @xmath89 .",
    "the s - wave term of the pion self - energy is taken in the so called `` @xmath90 '' approximation , @xmath91 using the free space s - wave @xmath2-@xmath1 scattering amplitudes calculated in the present model .",
    "this term includes the contribution of @xmath3-h excitation through the isospin 1/2 amplitude @xmath92 , and is small compared to the p - wave one and becoming only sizable for very energetic pions with about 700 mev momentum .",
    "= 58 mm    the total self - energy of pion is given by @xmath93 and in fig.[fig : piprop ] we show the self - energy(left ) , propagator(center ) and spectral function(right ) of the pion for 500 mev momentum for normal nuclear matter density .",
    "in the self - energy(left ) graph , the accompanying dotted and dashed dotted lines correspond to the case when we take only the @xmath1-h and @xmath81-h excitations .",
    "they show that the contribution of @xmath72 is relatively small .",
    "one of the needed input in our evaluation is the self - energy of the @xmath0 which appears in the @xmath27 loop .",
    "however , this is not known beforehand since this is what we want to calculate here .",
    "we perform for this purpose a self - consistent calculation . in a first step ,",
    "the @xmath90 approximation is used since we have previously calculated the free @xmath27 t matrix . with this",
    "we obtain a new self - energy of the @xmath0 which is introduced in the second step , and so on until convergence is reached and one obtains an output @xmath0 self - energy equal to the input one .",
    "= 55 mm    fig.[fig : t66free ] shows the free space @xmath0-neutron scattering amplitude @xmath22 obtained in the present model .",
    "it is plotted as a function of the invariant energy @xmath41 , which is 1487 mev at the threshold .",
    "one sees that the amplitude changes drastically , even from attractive to repulsive , above the threshold .",
    "this is due to the coupling to the @xmath3 resonance which is generated dynamically in the present model .",
    "note that the threshold is about 50 mev below the center of the resonance .",
    "we can obtain the @xmath0 self - energy as an explicit function of @xmath12 and @xmath13 as independent variables .",
    "one of the interesting applications is the study of @xmath0 bound states in the nucleus , where the @xmath0 will have small energy and momenta . for this purpose",
    "we can evaluate the @xmath0 self - energy for @xmath94 and @xmath95 as a good approximation .",
    "non - local effects from the consideration of the energy and momentum dependence of the self - energy give very small corrections for weakly bound states as demonstrated in ref.@xcite for @xmath96 atoms .    in order to evaluate the @xmath0 self - energy in a first step",
    ", we substitute the free @xmath27 amplitude in eq.([eqn : selfint ] ) , setting @xmath97 , and obtain the @xmath0 self - energy for zero momentum shown in fig.[fig : iiabc ] top .",
    "this simplest calculation is nearly equal to the @xmath90 approximation .",
    "the magnitude of the self - energy increases almost linearly in @xmath5 and its shape reflects that of @xmath22 .",
    "= 55 mm    = 55 mm    = 55 mm    then we turn on the pauli blocking in the way explained in section 2 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 self - energy for zero momentum is shown in fig.[fig : iiabc ] middle . comparing to the top one , we see the interesting effects of the pauli blocking .",
    "first of all , the resonant shape is strongly enhanced .",
    "this can be understood as the reduction of the decay width of the resonance , since the pauli blocking forbids the decay to nucleons with momentum smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "second , the peak of the resonance , seen in the imaginary part of the amplitudes , or equivalently in the zero of the real part , is only shifted moderately to higher energies .",
    "this is in contrast with the @xmath11 case , where the @xmath98 resonance in the @xmath99 interaction , is about 80 mev shifted upward @xcite . as pointed out in ref.@xcite , this is natural because a large part of the @xmath3 resonance generated in the present model , comes from the @xmath100 , @xmath30 and @xmath28 components @xcite , which have nothing to do with pauli blocking . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is argued that the fermi motion compensates the decay width reduction due to the pauli blocking .",
    "there also is some effect of this sort here , but we still find a net reduction of the @xmath3 width due to the consideration of both effects , resulting in an enhanced strength of both the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath0 self - energy . a major difference in our model from ref.@xcite , at the present stage of the calculation , is the presence of the 3-body @xmath24 channels . also , our free space @xmath101 shown in fig.[fig : t66free ] , is already different from that in ref.@xcite , where the peak of the resonance is seen at around 1590 mev .    finally , we turn on the dressing of the hadrons in addition to pauli blocking .",
    "this study is the main novelty of the present work .",
    "we use the input explained in the previous section . besides this , we need the spectral function of the @xmath0 in order to calculate the @xmath27 loop function .",
    "as stated in the previous section , we determine it in a self - consistent way by iterating the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "this means that we need to study the finite momentum case even if we are interested only in the @xmath0 with zero momentum .",
    "we , hence , evaluate the @xmath0 self - energy also for finite momentum and , for example , fig.[fig : sp2d ] left shows a rough sketch of the @xmath0 spectral function obtained at normal nuclear matter density as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the results in what follows include the dressed @xmath0 accounting for the @xmath0 self - energy as a function @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "= 60 mm   = 55 mm    the @xmath0 self - energy for zero momentum obtained in this self - consistent approach is shown in fig.[fig : iiabc ] bottom .",
    "one can see the effects of the hadron dressing in comparison to the middle figure of the panel .",
    "apparently , the strength is spread wider .",
    "this is expected because the @xmath0 spectrum is distributed as stated above .",
    "even then , the resonant shape is still clearly visible .",
    "the center of the resonance is shifted upward , for example , about 25 mev for normal nuclear matter density .",
    "this means that the sum of the repulsion on @xmath69 and so on , surpasses the attraction on the pions .",
    "the difference of the hyperon binding energy and the nucleon one , works as a repulsion for this calculation .",
    "the dressed @xmath0 also shifts it upward slightly because the @xmath0 with large momentum(larger than about 250 mev ) feels a weak repulsion , as shown in fig.[fig : sp2d ] right .",
    "recall that the @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath27 components are more important than the @xmath23 and @xmath61 components for the resonance in the present model .",
    "the 25 mev shift for normal nuclear matter density is small(less than 2% of the @xmath3 mass ) and consistent with @xmath0 photo - production data @xcite , which together with the theoretical analysis of ref.@xcite assuming no shift of the resonance , suggest that the in - medium mass of the resonance is almost the same as in free space .",
    "= 55 mm   = 55 mm    fig.[fig : spfull ] left shows the spectral function of a zero momentum @xmath0 corresponding to the final self - energy .",
    "we see still a narrow peak even for normal nuclear matter density and , hence , it makes sense to regard the @xmath0 in the medium as a quasi - particle with a modified mass .",
    "it is interesting to note a second peak in the spectral function at higher energies , which , as noted in ref.@xcite , comes from the coupling of the @xmath0 to the @xmath3-h .",
    "we can observe in the figure that as the density increases the two peaks move away from each other .",
    "we define the effective mass @xmath104 as the energy @xmath12 which satisfies @xmath105=0 ~ , \\label{eqn : effmass}\\ ] ] which is almost the position of the peak in the spectral function .",
    "the result is plotted in fig.[fig : spfull ] right , which indicates that approximately one has @xmath106 in short .",
    "this moderate downward shift agree with the result of @xcite . while , a much stronger , about 11% , downward shift for normal nuclear matter density , is reported in @xcite where the quark meson coupling model is used .",
    "it should be interesting to test these predictions from experimental data of @xmath0 mesic nuclei .",
    "the optical potential @xmath107 and the effective @xmath0-neutron scattering length @xmath108 defined as @xmath109 are useful when we study the bound state of an @xmath0 in nuclei using the local density approximation .",
    "we plot them in fig.[fig : optfull ] .",
    "one can see that the real and imaginary parts of the optical potential deviate as the density increases .",
    "the real part becomes larger than the linear @xmath110 approximation while the imaginary part is nearly @xmath110 .",
    "this behavior is better seen in the effective scattering length , where the real part increases and the imaginary part almost stays the same .",
    "the depth of the optical potential at normal nuclear matter density is @xmath111 mev .",
    "this value is not in contradiction with the 5% ( 28 mev ) mass shift of the @xmath0 , because the self - energy is evaluated at an @xmath0 energy equal to the @xmath0 mass , while the effective @xmath0 mass , @xmath12 in eq.([eqn : effmass ] ) , is obtained using the @xmath0 self - energy calculated at same @xmath12 energy .",
    "it is interesting to compare these result with the ones obtained in the literature . in ref.@xcite",
    "the potential obtained was @xmath112 which provides an imaginary part similar to ours but the real part is about one half of the one obtained here . in ref.@xcite",
    "the potential obtained assuming that the mass of the @xmath3 did not change in the medium , as we showed it was approximately the case here , was @xmath113 at @xmath114 , somewhere in between the two former results .",
    "= 55 mm   = 55 mm    in order to facilitate the task of making an accurate as possible prediction for the @xmath0 bound states in nuclei , we parameterize our results for the @xmath0 self - energy as a function of energy and density . given the strong energy dependence of the @xmath115 seen in fig.[fig : iiabc ] for @xmath116 , the consideration of this explicit energy dependence in the klein - gordon equation should be important .",
    "we can parameterize our results in the region @xmath117 , as @xmath118 & = &            a(\\rho ) + b(\\rho)(k^0-m_{\\eta } )        + c(\\rho)(k^0-m_{\\eta})^2 + d(\\rho)(k^0-m_{\\eta})^3 \\\\",

    "in the present paper we have used a chiral unitary approach successfully applied to the study of the @xmath23 interaction and its coupled channels , in particular the @xmath10 channel , in order to evaluate the @xmath0 self - energy in a nuclear medium .",
    "we have taken into account the standard many body effects like fermi motion and the pauli blocking in the intermediate @xmath1 states .",
    "in addition we have also included the self - energy of the baryons and mesons in the intermediate states , including the @xmath0 self - energy in a self - consistent way .",
    "the results obtained are interesting . while qualitatively similar to other ones obtained before , we obtain however a deeper potential with a real part about twice as big as in former , more simplified , studies .",
    "in addition we show that the energy dependence of the @xmath0 self - energy is very pronounced below the @xmath0 threshold and it would be interesting to consider it in studies of @xmath0 bound states in nuclei . for this purpose",
    "we have parameterized our results in an easy analytical form which can be used to solve the klein - gordon equation for @xmath0 bound states or to interpret some physical processes where @xmath0 states close to threshold play some role @xcite .",
    "the stronger real part of our potential compared to previous ones and the fact that the imaginary part of the potential decreases rapidly as the @xmath0 energy decreases , open new hopes that @xmath0 mesic states , relatively wide , but narrow enough compared to the binding energy , could exist and be identified in actual experiments .",
