    "the observed variation of galaxy properties as a function of environment @xcite is evidently an important clue to how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "the two classic observations that drive this field of study are that nearby galaxy clusters contain a higher fraction of e / s0 galaxies than observed in the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that the fraction of blue galaxies in a cluster increases as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "the subsequent interpretation of these results has been varied , often conflicting , and not yet distilled .",
    "the difficulty , in part , lies in the lack of direct observations that trace star formation in large samples of cluster and field galaxies .",
    "broad - band colors are most often used to trace star - formation rates ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these offer a crude measure and are affected by dust and metallicity .",
    "comparisons of emission - line measurements of star formation are complicated by the use of different lines at different redshifts , by the difficulty in getting large samples at high ( @xmath9 ) redshifts , and by the dust and metallicity sensitivity of [ o  ii ] , the most popular indicator at high redshift .",
    "we present our initial attempt to compile a sample of h@xmath0   measurements of star formation in a sample of high - redshift ( @xmath10 ) galaxy clusters by presenting the results for our first completed cluster , cl  j0023@xmath60423b",
    ". the advantages of these h@xmath0  data are that they are directly comparable to @xmath11 studies , they directly measure the ionizing flux from young stars , and they are less sensitive to extinction than the common [ o  ii ] measurements .    even at low redshift , h@xmath0",
    "observations of cluster populations are limited .",
    "@xcite and @xcite use h@xmath0  spectroscopy to study the star - formation properties of four nearby clusters and find that cluster and field spirals of a given morphology have similar star - formation rates ( sfrs ) in three of four clusters .",
    "in contrast , an objective prism study of nearby abell clusters , @xcite find that the difference in star - formation properties between field and cluster spirals depends on morphology .",
    "cluster h@xmath0  studies have now been pushed out to redshifts of @xmath12 using imaging @xcite and spectroscopy @xcite .    at intermediate and high redshift",
    "the results have depended on the less robust [ o ii ] measure of star formation .",
    "the cnoc @xcite and morphs @xcite surveys agree that cluster galaxies of all hubble types have lower sfrs than the same type field galaxies .",
    "however , photometric modeling of the cnoc clusters favors a slow decline in star formation @xcite as one approaches the cluster , while the morphs spectroscopy reveal a large population of starburst and post - starburst cluster galaxies , which reflect sudden and dramatic changes in star formation rates . in a cluster at @xmath13 , @xcite",
    "find that although the observed merger rate is significantly higher than the field , there is no sign of excess star formation .",
    "@xcite study four @xmath14 clusters and find that cluster galaxies have systematically lower sfrs than field galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "the only result that appears to be consistent throughout all of these studies and across redshift is that cluster galaxies have lower rates of star formation than field galaxies .",
    "the origin of this empirical result is still debated .",
    "given this situation , one might naturally conclude that significant progress could be made at any redshift , and that all things being equal one should focus at low redshift . however , there are two developments at low redshift that will vastly improve the current situation .",
    "sdss and 2df have already begun to provide h@xmath0  measurements of star formation in local galaxies as a function of environment @xcite , and an ongoing deep h@xmath0  selected survey of nearby clusters will complete the picture @xcite . for high - redshift , one wants to push as high as possible to maximize the evolutionary effects .",
    "the redshift regime of @xmath15 is the highest for which there exists a significant number of clusters with complementary data , such as redshifts and morphologies ; however , h@xmath0  moves beyond the optical window into the @xmath16 band .    to observe the h@xmath0  line , we are undertaking a near - infrared , narrow - band h@xmath0  imaging survey of ten @xmath8 clusters . here",
    "we present results for the first cluster in our sample , cl  j0023@xmath60423b .",
    "the goals of this initial paper are to demonstrate the accuracy and sensitivity of the technique and to provide the first comparison between h@xmath0  imaging results for a cluster at @xmath8 and similar surveys of lower - redshift clusters .",
    "we choose clj0023 + 0423b as part of our cluster sample because its redshifted h@xmath0  emission lies in a standard near - infrared narrow - band filter ( figure [ jcont ] ) and because it has hubble space telescope ( @xmath17 ) wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) imaging and keck spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "these additional data provide a necessary complement to our imaging .",
    "for example , @xcite present a mass estimate for the cluster , @xmath18 , and @xcite use wfpc2 imaging to measure an early - type fraction of @xmath19 , a value comparable to that of the field .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  [ clj0023_reduction ] we describe the observations and data reduction procedure . in  [ clj0023_fluxcal ]",
    "we explain the calibration of the narrow - band images , and in  [ clj0023_contsub ]",
    "we describe the continuum - subtraction process and model the associated uncertainties .",
    "results from the narrow - band imaging are presented in ",
    "[ clj0023_results ] , and we discuss these results in the context of existing observations in  [ clj0023_discussion ] . the paper is summarized in  [ clj0023_summary ] .",
    "we assume @xmath20 and @xmath21 throughout and express results in terms of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "we observed cl  j0023 + 0423b using the pisces near - infrared camera @xcite at the 6.5 m mmt on 2002 december 19 equipped with a standard @xmath16-continuum narrow - band filter ( @xmath24 , see figure [ jcont ] ) .",
    "a @xmath16-band image , appropriately scaled ( see  [ clj0023_contsub ] ) , is used for continuum subtraction .",
    "individual exposures are 90 seconds for the @xmath16-band and ten minutes for the narrow - band .",
    "the total integration time is 100 and 22.5 minutes for the narrow and @xmath16-bands respectively .",
    "the telescope is dithered between successive images in increments of 10 to 15 .",
    "conditions were photometric and the seeing was 0.9 arcsec .",
    "pisces does not yet have a guiding capability at the mmt , so each of the ten minute exposures is unguided , which results in slight degradation of the image quality ( an effective seeing of 1.1 arcsec ) .",
    "the pixel scale of pisces at the mmt is 0.18 arcsec / pixel with an inscribed circular field of 3.1 arcmin in diameter which corresponds to 1.0  @xmath25  mpc at @xmath1 .",
    "the image processing follows a standard procedure .",
    "pisces images exhibit a cross - talk phenomenon where each pixel in one quadrant leaves a negative imprint and tail at the identical positions in the three other quadrants ( see @xcite @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we first correct the images for this cross - talk and then subtract the dark frame . dividing by dome flats removes small scale pixel sensitivity variations . to remove large scale gradients",
    ", we divide the object frames by an image that is the result of median combining object frames using an upper rejection threshold of @xmath26100  adu above the maximum sky level .",
    "a bad pixel mask is used to eliminate these pixels from being included in the construction of the final combined frame .",
    "we map the geometric distortion in the @xmath16 and narrow - band filters using mmt / pisces observations of the open cluster ngc  1193 taken on 2002 october 13 , the united states naval observatory star catalog @xcite , and the iraf task geomap .",
    "the residuals from a fifth order legendre polynomial astrometric fit in both the x and y directions have an rms of 0.5  along each axis .",
    "we correct the images for this distortion using the iraf geotran task .",
    "the object frames are aligned and combined , and the final narrow and @xmath16-band images are aligned using geotran .",
    "the combined @xmath16 and narrow - band images have an effective seeing fwhm of 1.1 , or six pixels .",
    "the final narrow - band images require some slight further processing to ensure uniformity in the background . while the combined @xmath16-band image shows peak - to - valley variations that are @xmath27 across the entire array , the combined narrow - band image has large - scale variations in sky level that are @xmath28% .",
    "we use sextractor @xcite to create an image of the residual background variation .",
    "unsure of the origin of these remaining variations in sky level , we try both subtracting and normalizing by the background image .",
    "re - flattening the data produces fewer spurious emission and absorption detections , so we use this technique to remove the residual , large - scale sky variations .",
    "the resulting narrow - band image is flat to within @xmath29% across the entire image .",
    "because the pisces camera has an inscribed circular field , some corners in the combined frames have not been fully illuminated in each exposure .",
    "we exclude these underexposed , lower signal - to - noise areas from our analysis .",
    "we use sextractor for source detection and photometry with parameters set to ensure detection of all objects that are visually detected in the combined @xmath16 @xmath6 narrow - band image .",
    "the adopted selection parameters are a signal - to - noise threshold of 2.0@xmath30 per pixel where @xmath30 is the standard deviation in sky , a minimum object area of 12 pixels , a tophat 5x5 convolution kernel , and a background mesh size of 48 pixels .",
    "source positions and apertures are determined using the combined @xmath16 and narrow - band image and then applied to the @xmath16 , narrow , and narrow @xmath31 scaled @xmath16-band images as described below .",
    "we measure aperture magnitudes in each of these three images using an aperture defined by the outer isophote of the detection threshold in the @xmath16 + narrow image .",
    "these detection criteria correspond to a @xmath16-band total magnitude limit of @xmath32 as determined by the sextractor mag - auto algorithm .",
    "the h@xmath0  flux limit is set by the minimum object size and the noise in the continuum - subtracted image .",
    "the average standard deviation of the background calculated in several @xmath33 pixel boxes is 0.011  @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath35 noise associated with a sum over the minimum 12 pixel object area is 0.038  @xmath34 , and our adopted @xmath36 detection threshold is 0.11  @xmath34 .",
    "this limit corresponds to the smallest possible object area of 12 pixels .",
    "the median object area is 54 pixels , and the associated @xmath2 error is 0.24  @xmath34 .",
    "converting continuum - subtracted narrow - band fluxes to sfrs requires knowing 1 ) the relative throughputs of the @xmath16 and narrow - band filters , 2 ) the calibration of the @xmath16-band flux to @xmath37 , and 3 ) the conversion factor from photons  s@xmath38 to sfr for h@xmath0  photons .",
    "we relate the narrow - band filter to the @xmath16-band filter , which is part of a standard magnitude system , by observing solar - type standard stars from @xcite through both filters .",
    "we use these data and the iraf daophot package to solve the @xmath16-band photometric transformation equation , solving only for the zeropoint and airmass terms ( see table [ phot ] for a solution of pisces calibration data taken on 2002 december 19 ) .",
    "narrow and @xmath16-band images are corrected for airmass using the @xmath16-band extinction .",
    "this is appropriate because we find the ratio of narrow - to-@xmath16 fluxes to be independent of airmass for the cl  j0023@xmath60423b  filter . to calculate the expected ratio of efficiencies between the two filters we integrate the planck function for @xmath39  k over both the @xmath16 and narrow band filters , multiplying by the filter and atmospheric transmissions at each wavelength .",
    "we assume that the detector quantum efficiency is constant over both filter bandpasses",
    ". the calculated ratio of narrow - to-@xmath16 photons is 0.0507 for a solar - type star .",
    "we repeat the calculation using a model solar spectrum @xcite and obtain consistent results .",
    "we adopt the planck function because of its convenient functional form .",
    "we convert the @xmath16-band flux of a standard star to janskys using a @xmath16 magnitude zeropoint of 1600 jy @xcite , then to ergs  s@xmath38  @xmath40 by multiplying by the @xmath16 filter bandwidth of 0.3  , and then to photons  s@xmath38  @xmath40 by dividing by @xmath41 , where the central wavelength of our @xmath16 filter is 1.25  .",
    "the predicted photons  s@xmath38  @xmath40 in the narrow - band filter is the product of the @xmath16-band flux times the ratio of the narrow - to-@xmath16 integrals .    to convert to sfr , we first correct fluxes by 1 magnitude for dust extinction @xcite and scale by 0.77 to correct for [ n  ii ] contamination @xcite .",

    "show that the kennicutt sfr conversion is robust on average .",
    "however , the conversion varies by a factor of 2.5 from the lowest to highest mass galaxies .",
    "we do not have the additional spectral information required to fine - tune the sfr conversion , so our sfrs have an associated @xmath2630% uncertainty that we add in quadrature to other sources of random error .",
    "the average narrow - band flux zeropoint determined from three standard stars is listed in table [ phot ] in units of @xmath37 and in sfr limits in units of @xmath3 .",
    "our @xmath2 detection threshold of 0.11  @xmath34 corresponds to 0.24  @xmath3  at @xmath1 .",
    "however , our detections are also limited in equivalent width , as discussed in  [ clj0023_contsub ] .",
    "h@xmath0  emission and absorption sources are defined to be sources that have nonzero residual ( narrow - band @xmath31 continuum ) flux .",

    "we compare two methods for calculating continuum - subtracted narrow - band fluxes . in the first method",
    ", we use sextractor to measure fluxes in the narrow and @xmath16-band images separately , and then difference the narrow - band and scaled @xmath16-band fluxes object by object . in the second method , we use sextractor to construct a background image for each filter , subtract these , and then subtract the scaled @xmath16-band image from the narrow - band image .",
    "we then run sextractor on the continuum - subtracted image .",
    "we scale the @xmath16-band image by 0.0488 , which corresponds to the ratio of narrow - to-@xmath16 throughputs assuming a flat spectral energy distribution .",
    "the residual h@xmath0  fluxes from the two methods agree within @xmath35 .",
    "we choose to work on the @xmath16 and narrow - band images separately because negative sources ( absorption ) in the continuum - subtracted image are not directly detected with sextractor , and any modifications of the relative throughputs of the filters is more difficult to implement .",
    "the scaled @xmath16-band flux provides an imperfect estimate of the continuum within the narrow - band . to quantify the error in our continuum estimates we calculate the measured narrow - band equivalent width ( ew ) for five galaxy types , e through sc , as a function of redshift using composite spectra from @xcite .",
    "we define ew as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the narrow - band flux in @xmath34 , @xmath45 is the calculated ratio of narrow - to-@xmath16 filter throughputs ( 0.0488 ) , @xmath46 is the @xmath16-band flux in @xmath34 , and @xmath47 is the bandwidth of the @xmath16-band filter or 0.3  . with this definition , emission sources have positive ews .",

    "the scatter in the measured ews is dominated by spectral features , not errors introduced by continuum slope across the @xmath16-band window . because , the cl  j0023@xmath60423b  filter lies in the middle of the @xmath16-band , the continuum slope through the @xmath16-band does not severely undermine the calculated narrow - band continuum .",
    "we discuss continuum - subtracted flux in terms of two quantities , rest - frame equivalent width ( ew@xmath48 ) and sfr . we define ew@xmath49ew@xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the cluster redshift , and we assume that all objects with significant ews are associated with the cluster . the uncertainty in ew@xmath48 is given by @xmath52 where the narrow and @xmath16-band flux errors , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are the sum in quadrature of zeropoint errors and sextractor photometric errors .",

    "inspection of the wfpc2 image shows a faint companion 0.7  away from clj0023 + 0423b@xmath3160 that we do not resolve in our ground - based data .",
    "this companion could be contributing to the excess narrow - band flux .",
    "this object warrants follow - up with near - infrared spectroscopy to determine the redshift , confirm the h@xmath0  flux , and study the spectral properties of the underlying stellar population . in conclusion ,",
    "the results from the galfit analysis show that ew@xmath48 decreases with increasing steepness of the galaxy profile as expected and that there is no significant population of early - type galaxies with ongoing star - formation .",

    "in this section we compare the star - formation properties of cl  j0023@xmath60423b  with comparable observations for other clusters at lower redshifts . comparing spectroscopic and imaging surveys",
    "is difficult , and comparing sfr measurements obtained with h@xmath0   vs. [ o  ii ] is even more problematic . because of these difficulties , we limit our comparison to three @xmath7 clusters from the literature for which h@xmath0  imaging or spectroscopy is available .",
    "the three surveys are summarized in table [ cljlitsfrs ] .",
    "analogous to the butcher - oemler blue fraction measurement is the fraction of emission - line galaxies . to provide a fair comparison to the low - redshift h@xmath0  studies",
    ", we have to apply four criteria to all clusters .",
    "first , we must sample the same radial fraction of each cluster relative to @xmath64 .",
    "then , we must apply the same ew , sfr , and absolute magnitude cuts to all data .",
    "the low - redshift spectroscopic samples are sensitive in terms of sfr and ew but have limited radial coverage ; the spectroscopic data for abell  1689 extends to only @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the imaging survey of @xcite has good areal coverage relative to @xmath64 but is sensitive to only the most actively star - forming galaxies with @xmath80   .",
    "thus , a fair comparison among the clusters in table [ cljlitsfrs ] requires that we sample only within @xmath79 and include only galaxies with @xmath80    as emission line .",
    "in addition , we must correct the non - emission line galaxy counts because a large faction ( @xmath2650% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not cluster members , and we do not have a large enough field area to do statistical subtraction . the fraction of emission - line galaxies is therefore complicated to calculate and uses only a small fraction of the available data .",
    "perhaps a simpler way to quantify the evolution of cluster sfrs is in terms of the integrated sfr per cluster mass .",
    "no correction for background / foreground galaxies is required , and this measure is less sensitive to incompleteness because the integrated sfr is dominated by galaxies whose sfr is easiest to detect . to calculate ,",
    "we apply the same radial cut to all four clusters , including only those galaxies that lie within a projected radial distance of @xmath81 .",
    "we choose a maximum radial extent of @xmath82 to approximate the radial survey size of ac  114 ( see table [ cljlitsfrs ] ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the radial coverage of abell 1689 does not extend to @xmath81 , so we multiply the integrated sfr by 1.35 to correct for incomplete sampling within @xmath81 , where we assume that the galaxy distribution follows the dark matter profile .",
    "this correction will still underestimate the integrated sfr if there is a strong increasing radial gradient in sfr .",
    "the integrated sfr for abell 1689 listed in table [ cljlitsfrs ] is corrected for volume .",
    "the integrated sfr per cluster mass might be expected to be a function of both redshift and cluster mass ( even beyond the normalization by cluster mass one might expect that more massive clusters are more evolved ) , and in figure [ clj0023_sfrz ] we plot sfr versus redshift for the four clusters and versus cluster velocity dispersion in figure [ clj0023_sfrsigma ] .",
    "these plots exemplify a key difficulty in assessing the evolution of cluster star formation , which is present in all studies of the butcher - oemler effect . a larger sample of @xmath8 clusters is needed to break this degeneracy between mass and redshift .",
    "we present h@xmath0-derived star - formation rates for the galaxy cluster cl  j0023 + 0423b ( @xmath1 ) and demonstrate that near - infrared narrow - band imaging is an effective and efficient method to sample the star - forming galaxy population in distant clusters .",
    "comparison with spectroscopy shows that the number of false detections is low ( @xmath83% ) , and that our h@xmath0  equivalent widths are correlated with the spectroscopically determined [ o  ii ] equivalent widths .",
    "we find that the magnitude - limited spectroscopic survey of this cluster by @xcite misses @xmath2670% of the star - forming galaxies and @xmath2665% of the integrated star formation within our image area .",
    "we fit sersic profiles to @xmath17 wfpc2 images of all galaxies with significant ew@xmath48 and find that ew@xmath48 decreases as the light profile steepens .",
    "no significant population of early - type galaxies with ongoing star formation is detected .",
    "we compare cl  j0023@xmath60423b  to three @xmath7 clusters from the literature for which h@xmath0  data are available and find that the integrated , mass - normalized sfr of cl  j0023@xmath60423b  is a factor of ten higher than that of the lower - redshift clusters . interpreting this difference",
    "is complicated by the strong correlation between integrated sfr and cluster mass that we find .",
    "imaging for a larger sample of @xmath84 clusters drawn from the ediscs sample , which spans a range in cluster mass , is ongoing .",
