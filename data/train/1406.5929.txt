    "water presents a large variety of solid phases . up to",
    "now sixteen different crystalline ice polymorphs have been identified , most of them obtained by application of high pressures , which produces a denser packing of water molecules than in the usual hexagonal ice ih.@xcite the determination of their crystal structures and stability range in the pressure - temperature phase diagram has been a subject of investigation over the last few decades . however , in spite of the wide amount of experimental and theoretical works on the solid phases of water , some of their properties still lack a full understanding .",
    "this is largely due to the presence of hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules , which give rise to some peculiar characteristics of these condensed phases ( the so - called ` water anomalies').@xcite    in the known ice polymorphs ( leaving out ice x ) , water molecules appear as well defined entities forming a network linked by h - bonds . in such a network",
    "each h@xmath2o molecule is h - bonded to four others in a disposition compatible with the so - called bernal - fowler ice rules .",
    "these rules state that each molecule is oriented so that its two h atoms point toward adjacent oxygen atoms and that there must be exactly one h atom between two contiguous oxygens.@xcite we will refer to these rules simply as ` ice rules . '",
    "orientational disorder of the water molecules is present in several ice phases .",
    "oxygen atoms show full occupancy ( @xmath3 ) of their crystallographic sites ( @xmath4 ) , but hydrogen atoms may present a disordered distribution , as indicated by a fractional occupancy of their lattice positions ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "for example , hexagonal ice ih presents full hydrogen disorder compatible with the ice rules ( occupancy of h - sites @xmath6 ) .",
    "other polymorphs such as ice ii are h - ordered , while some phases as ices iii and v display partial hydrogen order ( some fractional occupancies @xmath7 )",
    ".    the sixteen known crystalline ice phases can be classified according to their network topology .",
    "thus , one finds polymorphs sharing the same topology , as happens for ices ih and xi .",
    "something similar occurs for other ice polymorphs , and at present six such pairs of ice structures are known : ih - xi , iii - ix , v - xiii , vi - xv , vii - viii , and xii - xiv,@xcite where the first polymorph in each pair is h - disordered and the second is h - ordered . in each case",
    ", both polymorphs share the same network topology and are related one to the other through an order / disorder phase transition .",
    "in addition to these twelve polymorphs , there exist other ice structures for which no pair has been found : ice ic ( h - disordered ) , ice ii ( h - ordered ) , and ice iv ( h - disordered ) .",
    "finally , ice x is topologically equivalent to ices vii and viii , with the main difference that in ice x hydrogen atoms are situated on the middle point between adjacent oxygen atoms , so that water molecules lose in fact their own entity .",
    "then , one has nine topologically different ice structures .",
    "we note that the ice vii network ( as well as ices viii and x ) consists of two independent interpenetrating subnetworks not hydrogen - bonded to each other ( each of them equivalent to the ice ic network ) .",
    "there is another case , the pair vi - xv , for which the network is also made up of two disjoint subnetworks , but they are not equivalent to the network of any other known ice polymorph .    the first evaluation of the configurational entropy @xmath8 associated to h disorder in ice was presented by pauling,@xcite who found @xmath9 for a crystal of @xmath10 water molecules .",
    "this result turned out to be in rather good agreement with the ` residual ' entropy obtained from the experimental heat capacity of ice ih,@xcite even though the calculation did not consider the actual structure of this ice polymorph .",
    "nagle@xcite calculated later the residual entropy of hexagonal ice ih and cubic ice ic by a series method , and found for both polymorphs very similar values , which were close to but slightly higher than the pauling s estimate . in recent years ,",
    "et al._@xcite have employed multicanonical simulations to calculate the configurational entropy of ice ih , assuming a disordered h distribution consistent with the ice rules .",
    "furthermore , the configurational entropy of partially ordered ice phases has been studied earlier,@xcite and will not be addressed here .",
    "besides their application to condensed phases of water , ice - type models are relevant for other types of solids displaying atomic or spin disorder,@xcite as well as in statistical - mechanics studies of lattice problems.@xcite at present , no analytical solutions for the ice model in actual three - dimensional ( 3d ) ice structures are known , so that no exact values for the configurational entropy are available .",
    "an exact solution was found by lieb@xcite for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice , where the entropy resulted to be @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , a value somewhat higher than pauling s result @xmath13 .",
    "a goal of the present work consists in finding relations between thermodynamic properties and topological characteristics of ice polymorphs . in this line",
    ", it has recently been shown that the network topology plays a role to quantitatively describe the configurational entropy associated to hydrogen disorder in ice structures.@xcite this has been known after the work by nagle,@xcite who showed that the actual structure is relevant for this purpose , by comparing his results for ices ih and ic with pauling s value for the configurational entropy , which is in fact the limiting value corresponding to a loop - free network ( bethe lattice ) .    in this paper , we present a simple but ` formally exact ' numerical method , to obtain the configurational entropy of h - disordered ice structures . it is based on a thermodynamic integration from high to low temperatures for a model whose lowest - energy states are consistent with the ice rules .",
    "the configurational space is sampled by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , which provide us with accurate values for the heat capacity of the considered model .",
    "this method has been employed earlier to calculate the entropy of h - disordered ices ih and vi in ref .  . apart from ice ih , ic , and vi , we are not aware of any calculation of the configurational entropy of other h - disordered ice polymorphs .",
    "entropy calculations have been also carried out earlier for h distributions displaying partial ordering on the available crystallographic sites , as happens for ices iii and v.@xcite",
    "for concreteness , we recall the ice rules , as established by bernal and fowler@xcite in 1933 : first , there is one hydrogen atom between each pair of neighboring oxygen atoms , forming a hydrogen bond , and second , each oxygen atom is surrounded by four h atoms , two of them covalently bonded and two other h - bonded to it .",
    "fulfillment of these rules implies that short - range order must be present in the distribution of h atoms in ice polymorphs .",
    "calculating the configurational entropy of different ice structures , assuming that the hydrogen distribution is only conditioned by the ice rules , is equivalent to find the number of possible hydrogen configurations compatible with these rules .",
    "since the entropy is a state function , one can employ any thermodynamic integration that connects the required state with any other state whose thermodynamic properties are known . for the present problem ,",
    "this can be adequately done by considering a simple model , in which an energy function is defined so that all states compatible with the ice rules are equally probable ( have the same energy @xmath14 ) , and other hydrogen configurations have higher energy .",
    "the calculation of the configurational entropy of ice is thus reduced to finding the degeneracy of the ground state of considered model . taking the h configurations according to their boltzmann weight ,",
    "as is usual in the canonical ensemble , only those with the minimum energy @xmath14 will appear for @xmath15 . in this respect ,",
    "the only requirement for a valid energy model is that it has to reproduce the ice rules at low temperature .",
    "thus , irrespective of its simplicity , it will yield the actual configurational entropy if an adequate thermodynamic integration is carried out .",
    "our model is defined as follows .",
    "we consider an ice structure as defined by the positions of the oxygen atoms , so that each o atom has four nearest o atoms .",
    "this defines a network , where the nodes are the o sites , and the links are h - bonds between nearest neighbors .",
    "the network coordination is four , which gives a total of @xmath16 links , @xmath10 being the number of nodes .",
    "we assume that on each link there is one h atom , which can move between two positions on the link ( close to one oxygen or close to the other ) .",
    "we will use reduced variables , so that quantities such as the energy @xmath17 and the temperature @xmath18 are dimensionless .",
    "the entropy per site @xmath19 presented below is related with the physical configurational entropy @xmath8 as @xmath20 , @xmath21 being boltzmann s constant .        for a given configuration of h atoms on an ice network ,",
    "the energy @xmath17 is defined as : @xmath22 where the sum runs over the @xmath10 nodes in the network , and @xmath23 is the number of hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the oxygen on site @xmath24 , which can take the values @xmath23 = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 .",
    "the energy associated to site @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 ( see fig .  1 ) , having a minimum for @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , which imposes accomplishment of the ice rules at low temperature . in this way , all hydrogen configurations compatible with the ice rules on a given structure are equally probable , because they have the same energy ( @xmath28 in our case ) .",
    "this energy model is a convenient tool to derive the configurational entropy , but it does not represent any realistic interatomic interaction .",
    "in fact , we are not dealing with an actual ordering process in an h - bond network , but with a numerical approach to ` count ' h - disordered configurations .",
    "one can obtain the number of configurations compatible with the ice rules on a given structure by a thermodynamic integration , going from a reference state ( @xmath29 ) for which the h configuration is random ( does not follow the ice rules ) , to a state in which these rules are strictly satisfied ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this model assumes that all hydrogen arrangements that satisfy the bernal - fowler rules are energetically degenerate . in the actual ice structures",
    "there will be variations in the energy due to different hydrogen bonding patterns.@xcite for large system size and at temperatures at which the h - disordered phases are stable , the crystal structures corresponding to different hydrogen arrangements will form a nearly degenerate energy band , populated almost uniformly . thus",
    ", the idea underlying the calculation of ` residual ' entropies is that the accessible hydrogen configurations do not correspond to the actual stable phase at @xmath30 ( which should be ordered ) , but to an equilibrium h - disordered phase at higher @xmath18 .",
    "this means that small energy differences between different hydrogen arrangements are supposed to not affect significantly their relative weight for the residual entropy , as these arrangements will have nearly the same probability in the ( equilibrium ) disordered phase .",
    "we obtain the configurational entropy per site at temperature @xmath18 from the heat capacity , @xmath31 , as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and the entropy in the high - temperature limit ( @xmath29 ) is given by @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the number of links in the considered network , and @xmath36 is the total number of possible configurations in our model , as two different positions are accessible for an h atom on each link .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ st1 ] ) is exact in principle , a practical problem in this thermodynamic integration appears because the limit @xmath29 can not be reached in actual simulations .",
    "one can introduce a high - temperature cutoff @xmath37 for this integration , but even if @xmath37 is very high ( in our units @xmath38 ) , it may introduce uncontrolled errors in the calculated entropies .",
    "thus , a reasonable solution to this problem can be calculating the integral in eq .",
    "( [ st1 ] ) up to a temperature @xmath37 , and then obtaining the remaining part ( from @xmath37 to @xmath39 ) by an alternative method . with this purpose",
    ", an analytical procedure has been introduced in ref .  , and is described in the following section dealing with an independent - site model .",
    "for a real ice network , thermodynamic variables at high temperatures ( @xmath40 here ) can be well described by considering ` independent ' nodes , as in pauling s original calculation for a hypothetical loop - free network . in such a case ,",
    "the partition function can be written as @xmath41 @xmath42 being the one - site partition function , and the term @xmath43 in the denominator appears to avoid counting links with zero or two h atoms .",
    "this correction is in fact similar to that introduced by pauling in his entropy calculation.@xcite    to obtain the partition function @xmath42 , we consider the 16 possible configurations of four hydrogen atoms , as given in fig .  1 , which yields at temperature @xmath18 : @xmath44         =    6 + 8 \\ , { \\rm e}^{-1/t } + 2 \\ , { \\rm e}^{-2/t }   \\ , .",
    "\\label{z68}\\ ] ] from this expression for @xmath42 one obtains the partition function @xmath45 using eq .",
    "( [ zz ] ) .",
    "thus , the high - temperature limit of @xmath45 is @xmath46 , which is the number of configurations compatible with the condition of having an h atom per link , as indicated above .    in this independent - site model , the energy per site at temperature @xmath18 is @xmath47 for the entropy per site we have @xmath48 and using eqs .",
    "( [ zz ] ) and ( [ umean ] ) , one finds @xmath49 in the limit @xmath15 ( ice rules strictly fulfilled ) , we have @xmath50 and @xmath51 [ see eq.([z68 ] ) ] , so that @xmath52 , which coincides with pauling s",
    "result.@xcite    for our calculations on real ice networks we will employ a cutoff temperature @xmath53 . introducing this temperature in eq .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) , we find for the independent - site model @xmath54 = 1.38414 , which coincides with the value obtained in ref .   from a series expansion in powers of @xmath55 up to fourth order .",
    "the above independent - site equations are exact for a loop - free network , i.e. , the so - called bethe lattice or cayley tree.@xcite for real ice structures , the corresponding networks contain loops , which means that the factorization of the partition function in eq .",
    "( [ zz ] ) is not possible .",
    "nevertheless , at high temperatures thermodynamic variables for the real structures converge to those of the independent - site model , and this is the fact we use to obtain the high - temperature part of our thermodynamic integration .",
    "thus , for the actual ice networks we calculate the configurational entropy per site for hydrogen - disordered distributions compatible with the ice rules ( accomplished in our method for @xmath15 ) as : @xmath56 where @xmath54 = 1.38414 is the value obtained for the independent - site model , and the heat capacity @xmath31 is derived from mc simulations for the considered ice polymorph in the temperature range from @xmath30 to @xmath57 ( we will take @xmath53 here ) .",
    ".crystal system and space group for the ice polymorphs studied in this work , along with the references from where crystallographic data were taken .",
    "@xmath58 is the number of water molecules in the largest supercell employed here for each ice structure .",
    "+ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for other ice structures not shown in fig .  5 we also obtained @xmath0 values between the square lattice and the pauling result ( see table  ii ) .",
    "the largest value corresponds to ice vi ( @xmath59 ) , and the smallest one was found for ice xii ( @xmath60 ) . between both values",
    "one finds a relative difference of about 3% . for hexagonal ice ih ,",
    "the configurational entropy is found to be an 1.3% larger than pauling s estimate . for other ice polymorphs ,",
    "the difference between @xmath0 and the pauling result ranges from 0.7% for ice xii to 3.9% for ice vi .",
    "information on the least - square fit of @xmath61 values for different ice polymorphs , such as the parameter @xmath62 , the correlation coefficient @xmath63 , and the number of points @xmath64 employed in the fit , are given in table  ii .",
    "when discussing the configurational entropy of ice , it is usually given in the literature the parameter @xmath65 , instead of the entropy @xmath0 itself .",
    "here , we find directly @xmath0 from thermodynamic integration and finite - size scaling , so that @xmath65 values given in table  ii were calculated for the different ice polymorphs as @xmath66 .",
    "the error bars @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the values of @xmath0 and @xmath65 are related by the expression @xmath69 , as can be derived by differentiating the exponential function .",
    "error bars for @xmath0 represent one standard deviation , as given by the least - square procedure employed to fit the data .",
    "these error bars are less than @xmath70 , except for ice vi , for which we found @xmath71 .    for comparison with the results found for the ice structures ,",
    "we also give in table  ii data for the 2d square lattice ( linear fit shown in fig .",
    "4 ) and for a loop - free network with coordination @xmath72 ( pauling s result ) .",
    "note that , although the result obtained by pauling was intended to reproduce the residual entropy of ice ih , it does not take into account the actual ice network , but only the fourfold coordination of the structure .",
    "now the question arises why the entropy per site decreases for increasing supercell size .",
    "a qualitative explanation is the following .",
    "let us call @xmath73 the number of configurations compatible with the ice rules for supercell size @xmath10 .",
    "for two independent cells of size @xmath10 , the number of possible configurations is then @xmath74 . if one puts both cells together to form a larger cell of size @xmath35 , one has @xmath75 , since configurations not fitting correctly at the border between both @xmath10-size cells are unsuitable and have to be rejected .",
    "then , one has @xmath76 something similar can be argued in general for two different cell sizes , @xmath77 , so that @xmath78 .",
    "this means that the decrease in @xmath61 for rising @xmath10 can be considered to be a consequence of the cyclic boundary conditions . assuming that @xmath61 behaves regularly as a function of @xmath79 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath80 )",
    ", one can write for large @xmath10 the power expansion : @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , this is what we found from our simulations for the different ice polymorphs , with the parameter @xmath82 so small that a linear dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath79 is consistent with the results of the thermodynamic integration at least for @xmath83 .    for ice ih",
    "we find @xmath0 = 0.41069(8 ) .",
    "as already observed in the analytical result by nagle@xcite and in the multicanonical simulations by berg _",
    "et al._,@xcite the configurational entropy is higher than the earlier estimate by pauling .",
    "our result is somewhat higher than that of nagle,@xcite who found @xmath0 = 0.41002(10 ) , and slightly higher than the results of multicanonical simulations , although the latter may be compatible with our data , taking into account the error bars .",
    "we do not find at present a clear reason why our result for ice ih is higher than that found by nagle using a series method .",
    "the error bar given by this author is not statistical , and one could argue that maybe it was underestimated , but this question should be further investigated . a discussion on the various results for ice ih is given in ref .  .    for cubic ice ic",
    ", we found @xmath0 = 0.41064(7 ) , which coincides within error bars with our result for hexagonal ice ih . to our knowledge",
    ", the only earlier calculation for ice ic is that presented by nagle in 1966,@xcite who concluded that within the limits of his estimated error , the entropy is the same for ices ic and ih , i.e. , @xmath0 = 0.41002(10 ) .",
    "we reach the same conclusion concerning both ice polymorphs , but in our case the entropy value is higher by an 0.15% .",
    "this difference seems to be small , but it is significant as it amounts to more than eight times our error bar ( standard deviation ) .",
    "it is known that ices iii and v show partially ordered hydrogen distributions .",
    "this means that some fractional occupancies of h - sites are different from 0.5 .",
    "then , the actual configurational entropy for these polymorphs is lower than that corresponding to a h - disordered distribution compatible with the ice rules .",
    "et al._@xcite calculated the configurational entropy of partially ordered ice phases by using an analytical procedure , based on a combinatorial calculation . for ices",
    "iii and v , these authors found entropy values @xmath0 = 0.3686 and 0.3817 , respectively , which they used to calculate the phase diagram of water with the tip4p model potential . taking the pauling result as the entropy value for h - disordered ice phases , the data by macdowell _",
    "_ mean an entropy reduction of 9.1% and 5.9% , for ice iii and v , respectively .",
    "this is an appreciable entropy reduction , which is noticeable in the calculated phase diagram.@xcite however , if one takes for the h - disordered phases more realistic entropy values , as those derived here , the entropy drop due to partial hydrogen ordering is somewhat larger .",
    "in fact , one finds 10.5% for ice iii and 7.6% for ice v. in any case , it is known that the hydrogen occupancies of the different crystallographic sites may change to some extent with the temperature , so that the configurational entropy will also change.@xcite",
    "topological characteristics of solids at the atomic or molecular level have been considered along the years to study properties of various types of materials.@xcite for crystalline ice polymorphs , a discussion of different network topologies and the relation of ring sizes in the various phases with the crystal volume was presented by salzmann _ et al._@xcite , and more recently by the present authors in ref .  .",
    "as indicated earlier,@xcite one expects that structural and topological aspects of ice networks can be relevant to understand quantitatively the configurational entropy of h - disordered structures .",
    "in particular , this entropy should in some way be related with effective parameters describing topological aspects of the corresponding networks .",

    "6 reveals that points corresponding to the ice structures are roughly aligned , with the exception of ices v and vi , which are located away from the general trend . a common characteristic of these two ice polymorphs is that they contain four - membered rings ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "in fact , we find a good linear correlation between @xmath0 and the mean ring size @xmath86 for these structures and the 2d square lattice ( dashed line in fig .",

    "we observe that the point corresponding to ice iii appears above the dashed - dotted line , whereas that corresponding to ice xii lies below it .",
    "this appears to be in line with the trend found for ices v and vi , since @xmath96 , indicating that for a given value of @xmath86 , a lower @xmath84 causes a larger entropy @xmath0 .",
    "these observations allow us to conclude that the configurational entropy tends to lower as the mean ring size increases , but the presence of four - membered rings greatly affects the actual value of the entropy @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the configurational entropy for ice vi turns out to be clearly higher than that of ice iii , even though both polymorphs have similar values of @xmath86 .",
    "however , the effect of four - membered rings is smaller for larger @xmath86 , as can be seen by comparing @xmath0 values for ices ii an v ( see fig .",
    "further than structural rings , the topology of a given ice network can be characterized by the so - called coordination sequences @xmath97 ( @xmath98 = 1 , 2 , ... ) , where @xmath99 is the number of sites at a topological distance @xmath98 from a reference site ( we call topological distance between two sites the number of bonds in the shortest path connecting one site to the other).@xcite for 3d structures , @xmath99 increases at large distances as : @xmath100 where @xmath87 is a network - dependent parameter .",
    "@xmath99 increases quadratically with @xmath98 just as the surface of a sphere increases quadratically with its radius . for structures including topologically non - equivalent sites ,",
    "the actual coordination sequences corresponding to different sites may be different , but the coefficient @xmath87 coincides for all sites in a given structure.@xcite this parameter @xmath87 can be used to define a ` topological density ' @xmath101 for ice polymorphs as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the number of disconnected subnetworks in the considered network .",

    "we find that @xmath0 decreases for increasing parameter @xmath87 , but there appears an appreciable dispersion in the data points , which can be associated to the size of structural rings in the considered ice polymorphs . in particular , ice networks including four - membered rings ( @xmath91 ) depart clearly from the general trend for the other structures , similarly to the fact observed above in fig .  6 for the relation between entropy and mean loop size .",
    "thus , two different fits are also displayed in fig .",
    "the dashed line is a linear fit for the ice polymorphs with @xmath91 ( ices v and vi ) , along with the 2d square lattice .",

    "7 .    from these results",
    "we conclude that the configurational entropy tends to decrease as the parameter @xmath87 ( density of nodes ) increases .",

    "thus , @xmath0 for ices v and vi ( with @xmath91 ) is clearly larger than that corresponding to ice polymorphs with similar @xmath87 values but with @xmath92 .",
    "we see that the correlation of the configurational entropy with both the mean loop size and the topological parameter @xmath87 is highly affected by the presence of structural rings with small number of water molecules , in particular by those of the smallest size found for the known crystalline polymorphs , @xmath90",

    "ii ) which can never intersect itself . the number @xmath109 of possible saws of length @xmath24 starting from a given network site is asymptotically given by@xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a critical exponent which takes a value @xmath112 for 3d structures.@xcite then",
    ", the connective constant @xmath88 can be obtained as the limit @xmath113 this parameter @xmath88 depends upon the particular topology of each structure , and has been accurately determined for standard 3d lattices.@xcite for the networks of different ice polymorphs , the connective constant @xmath88 has been recently calculated , and was compared with other topological characteristics of these networks.@xcite it ranges from 2.770 for ice vi to 2.918 for ice xii , as shown in table  iii .    in fig .",
    "8 we present the configurational entropy per site @xmath0 vs the connective constant @xmath88 for the considered ice polymorphs , as well as for the loop - free bethe lattice ( pauling s result ) and the 2d square lattice .",
    "one observes in this figure a negative correlation between the entropy @xmath0 and @xmath88 .",
    "the line is a least - square fit to the data points of the ice polymorphs .",
    "data corresponding to the square lattice and the bethe lattice were not included in the fit , as they depart from the trend of the ice structures .",
    "this seems to be due to the role played by dimensionality in the actual values of the configurational entropy ( the bethe lattice has no well - defined dimension @xmath114 , and for some purposes it can be considered as @xmath115 ) .    in relation to the data displayed in fig .  8 for ice polymorphs",
    ", we can not find at present any reason why the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath88 should be strictly linear , but it is clear that there is a relation between both magnitudes . to obtain some insight into this question ,",
    "a qualitative argument is the following .",
    "the connective constant @xmath88 is a measure of the mean number of sites connected to a node in long saws .",
    "then , for the distribution of h atoms on the links of the ice structures according to the bernal - fowler rules , a larger @xmath88 is associated to a rise in the correlations between occupancies of different hydrogen sites , as information on the actual occupancy of a link propagates ` more effectively ' through the ice network.@xcite this correlation gives rise to a decrease in the number of configurations compatible with the ice rules for a given structure , which means a reduction of the configurational entropy of the hydrogen distribution on the considered ice network .",
    "similar relations between saws and order / disorder problems , such as ising or lattice - gas models , have been found and discussed earlier.@xcite in this line , the relation observed here between configurational entropy and saws should be investigated further in the context of the statistical mechanics of lattice models .",
    "going back to the topological characteristics of ice structures , the smallest cycles of water molecules in crystalline ice phases are four - membered rings . as observed in figs .  6 and 7 , and commented above , the presence of these rings in ices v and vi imposes correlations on the hydrogen atom distribution clearly stronger than in other ice phases including larger rings",
    ". a qualitative argument for this fact can be obtained from an estimation of the way in which the presence of rings affects the configurational entropy , similarly to calculations carried out by hollins @xcite for ice ih .",
    "this author found that the correction to the pauling value ( @xmath116 ) introduced by six - membered rings ( considered to be independent ) is @xmath117 . using the same reasoning , with the so - called ` poles ' in ref .  , we find for ice vi a correction about 4.5 times larger ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "these values of @xmath67 are smaller than those found in the more precise thermodynamic integration given in table .",
    "ii , as the former do not take into account correlations such as those present between adjacent rings and at larger distances in the network . in any case",
    ", it is clear that the correlation introduced by four - membered rings is significantly stronger than for larger rings .",
    "this stronger correlation affects similarly the configurational entropy and connective constant of the h - bond networks studied here , as manifested by the correlation displayed by both quantities ( see fig .",
    "8) , where all considered ice phases , containing or not four - membered rings , follow the same trend .",
    "we have presented results for the configurational entropy of h - disordered ice structures , as calculated from a thermodynamic integration for a simple model which reproduces the bernal - fowler rules in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "this model has allowed us to obtain the entropy for different ices polymorphs , taking into account the actual structure of each of them .",
    "this procedure has turned out to be very precise , indicating that the associated error bars can be made relatively small without using elaborate procedures , but only employing standard statistical mechanics and numerical techniques .",
    "in fact , the estimated error bars of the calculated entropy values are about one part in 4,000 , i.e. around a 0.03% of the actual @xmath0 value .    for real ice structures we found entropy values ranging from @xmath0 = 0.4081 for ice xii to @xmath0 = 0.4214 for ice vi , which means a difference of 3.3% between these polymorphs .",
    "these values are 0.7% and 3.9% larger than pauling s result , respectively . for ice ih we obtained @xmath0 = 0.4107 , which is close to the result of earlier calculations using multicanonical simulations .",
    "given the diversity of ice structures , the resulting values of the configurational entropy have been analyzed in view of different aspects of the corresponding networks . in this line , it was found a trend of the entropy to lower as the mean ring size @xmath86 increases .",
    "however , the presence of four - membered rings in some polymorphs ( ices v and vi ) markedly affects the actual value of the entropy .",
    "a similar conclusion can be derived for the correlation between the configurational entropy and other topological parameters of ice networks , such as the parameter @xmath87 giving the topological density @xmath101 .",
    "a better correlation has been found between the configurational entropy of h - disordered ice polymorphs and the corresponding connective constants , derived from self - avoiding walks on their networks .",
    "this allows one to rationalize the entropy differences obtained for the ice polymorphs in terms of parameters depending on the actual topology of the associated structures .",
    "the entropy difference found here for real ice polymorphs may be important for detailed calculations of the phase diagram of water,@xcite as indicated earlier for ice phases with partial proton ordering.@xcite moreover , the method described here to calculate the configurational entropy of ice can be applied to other condensed - matter problems , such as the so - called spin - ice systems , where understanding the spin disorder is crucial to explain their magnetic properties.@xcite"
