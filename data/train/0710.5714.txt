    "nuclei accreting onto a neutron star undergo a variety of reactions . first at low densities , conventional thermonuclear fusion takes place ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "next as nuclei are buried to higher densities , the rising electron fermi energy induces a series of electron captures @xcite .",
    "finally at very high densities , nuclei can fuse via pycnonuclear reactions .",
    "these reactions are induced by the quantum zero point motion @xcite .",
    "the energy released , and the densities at which reactions occur , are important for determining the temperature profile of neutron star crusts .",
    "superbursts are very energetic x - ray bursts from accreting neutron stars that are thought to involve the unstable thermonuclear burning of carbon @xcite . however , some simulations do not reproduce the conditions needed for carbon ignition because they have too low temperatures @xcite .",
    "an additional heat source , from fusion or other reactions , could raise the temperature and allow carbon ignition at densities that reproduce observed burst frequencies .",
    "recently the cooling of two neutron stars has been observed after extended outbursts @xcite .",
    "these outbursts heated the crusts out of equilibrium and then the cooling time was measured as the crusts returned to equilibrium .",
    "the surface temperature of the neutron star in ks 1731 - 260 decreased with an exponential time scale of 325 @xmath8 100 days while mxb 1659 - 29 has a time scale of 505 @xmath8 59 days @xcite .",
    "these cooling times depend on the thermal conductivity of the crust and the initial temperature profile . comparing these observations of relatively rapid cooling to calculations by rutledge et al .",
    "@xcite and shternin et al .",
    "@xcite suggests that the crust has a high thermal conductivity .",
    "however , if the initial temperature profile of the crust is peaked near the surface , then this peak could quickly diffuse to the surface and lead to rapid cooling .",
    "therefore , cooling time scales are also sensitive to the initial temperature profile , and this depends on heating from nuclear reactions at moderate densities in the crust .",
    "gupta et al . have calculated heating from electron capture reactions in the outer crust @xcite .",
    "while they find more heating than previous works , they still find no more than 0.4 mev per nucleon total heating from all of the electron captures on any mass number @xmath9 system .",
    "haensel and zdunik have calculated pycnonuclear fusion reactions at great densities in the inner crust @xcite .",
    "however , if reactions occur deep in the inner crust , most of the heat may flow in to the core instead of out towards the surface . as a result",
    ", there may be a smaller impact on the temperature profile of the outer crust .",
    "a low crust thermal conductivity , for example from an amorphous solid , could help explain superburst ignition .",
    "this could better insulate the outer crust and allow higher carbon ignition temperatures .",
    "however , a low thermal conductivity appears to be directly contradicted by the observed short crust cooling times .",
    "furthermore , our molecular dynamics simulations in ref . @xcite and further results we present in section [ md ] find a regular crystal structure , even when the system has a complex composition with many impurities .",
    "we do not find an amorphous phase .",
    "these results will be discussed further in a later publication .",
    "we conclude that the thermal conductivity of the crust is high .",
    "if the thermal conductivity is high , one may need additional heat sources , at moderate densities , in order to explain superburst ignition .",
    "although gupta et al . find additional heating from electron captures to excited nuclear states , simple nuclear structure properties may provide a natural limit to the total heating from electron captures @xcite .",
    "haensel and zdunik @xcite consider heating from pycnonuclear reactions using a simple one component plasma model .",
    "they find that fusion reactions may not take place until relatively high densities above @xmath10 g/@xmath7 .",
    "however , their use of a one component plasma could be a significant limitation .",
    "fusion reactions depend strongly on the nuclear charge @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the reaction rate may be highest for the rare impurities that have the lowest @xmath0 , instead of for nuclei of average charge .    in this paper",
    ", we go beyond haensel and zdunik and consider a full mixture of complex composition instead of assuming one average charge and mass .",
    "we focus on thermonuclear and pycnonuclear reactions at densities around @xmath6 g/@xmath7 .",
    "this is near the base of the outer crust .",
    "heat released at this density could be important for superburst ignition and for crust cooling times .",
    "nuclei at this density are expected to be neutron rich .",
    "furthermore , the other nearby ions strongly screen the coulomb barrier and greatly enhance the rate of thermonuclear reactions .",
    "we begin by describing the initial composition .",
    "this includes neutron rich light nuclei such as @xmath4o and @xmath5ne .",
    "we calculate cross sections and @xmath3 factors for @xmath4o + @xmath4o and @xmath5ne + @xmath5ne fusion using a simple barrier penetration model .",
    "note that the dynamics of the neutron rich skins of these nuclei can enhance the cross section over that predicted by our simple barrier penetration model .",
    "this is a very interesting and open nuclear structure question , see for example @xcite .",
    "next , we use classical molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structure of the crust and screening factors for the enhancement of thermonuclear reactions .",
    "there are many previous calculations of screening factors for the one component plasma @xcite and for binary ion mixtures , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , we are not aware of any previous calculations for a crystal of a complex multicomponent composition .",
    "finally , we calculate reaction rates and conclude that @xmath4o is expected to fuse at densities near @xmath6 g/@xmath7 while @xmath5ne should react at densities near @xmath10 g/@xmath7 . heat from these reactions",
    "may be important for determining the temperature profile of accreting neutron stars .",
    "we now describe our model for the composition of the crust .",
    "this is the same as was used in previous work on chemical separation when the crust freezes @xcite .",
    "schatz et al . have calculated the rapid proton capture ( rp ) process of hydrogen burning on the surface of an accreting neutron star @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "this produces a variety of nuclei up to mass @xmath11 .",
    "gupta et al .",
    "then calculate how the composition of this rp process ash evolves , because of electron capture and light particle reactions , as the material is buried by further accretion .",
    "their final composition , at a density of @xmath12 g/@xmath7 , has forty % of the ions with atomic number @xmath13 , while an additional 10% have @xmath14 .",
    "the remaining 50% have a range of lower @xmath0 from 8 to 32 .",
    "in particular about 3% is @xmath4o and 1% @xmath5ne .",
    "this gupta et al .",
    "composition is listed in table [ tablezero ] . in general , nuclei at this depth in the crust",
    "are expected to be neutron rich because of electron capture .",
    ".abundance @xmath15 ( by number ) of chemical element @xmath0 and average mass number @xmath16 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tablefour ]    table [ tablefour ] also lists the ratio of temperature to ion plasma frequency , eq .",
    "( [ omegap ] ) .",
    "strictly speaking the thermonuclear fusion rate , eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) , is only valid for @xmath17 .",
    "we see that the rates in table [ tablefour ] involve an extrapolation of eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) to @xmath18 slightly below @xmath19 . at these temperatures",
    ", there will be some quantum corrections to eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) .",
    "however , the thermally enhanced pycnonuclear fusion rates in @xcite suggest that eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) is not wildly wrong at these temperatures .",
    "therefore , quantum corrections should not change our conclusions that @xmath4o will burn at a density near @xmath6 g/@xmath7 .",
    "we also consider @xmath5ne+@xmath5ne fusion since @xmath5ne is the next heavier nucleus in our rp process ash , after @xmath4o .",
    "however , because of the larger charge @xmath20 , we find that @xmath5ne will not burn until higher densities where the plasma frequency is much larger than the temperature .",
    "therefore @xmath5ne will not burn via thermonuclear fusion . instead",
    ", it will burn via pycnonuclear or thermally enhanced pycnonuclear fusion . using the pycnonuclear rates in ref .",
    "@xcite along with our @xmath3 factor from table [ tableone ] , we estimate that @xmath5ne will burn at densities near @xmath10 g/@xmath7 ( for temperatures near @xmath21k ) .",
    "the fusion of @xmath4o releases 0.52 mev per nucleon while @xmath5ne fusion releases 0.64 mev per nucleon .",
    "these energies are larger than the total heating from all of the electron captures considered by gupta et al .",
    "therefore , these and other related fusion reactions may be an important source of heat in the crust of accreting neutron stars .",
    "fusion reactions in the crust of an accreting neutron star are an important source of heat , and the depth at which these reactions occur is important for determining the temperature profile of the star .",
    "fusion reactions depend strongly on the nuclear charge @xmath0 .",
    "nuclei with @xmath1 can fuse at low densities in a liquid ocean .",
    "however , nuclei with @xmath2 or 10 may not burn until higher densities where the crust is solid and electron capture has made the nuclei neutron rich .",
    "in section [ crosssections ] we calculated the @xmath3 factor for fusion reactions of neutron rich nuclei including @xmath4o + @xmath4o and @xmath5ne + @xmath5ne .",
    "we used a simple barrier penetration model .",
    "we find that @xmath3 for @xmath4o+@xmath4o is over eight orders of magnitude larger than that for @xmath22o+@xmath22o .",
    "the @xmath3 factor could be further enhanced by dynamical effects involving the neutron rich skin of @xmath4o .",
    "for example , the skins of the two nuclei could deform to form a neck that would reduce the coulomb barrier .",
    "this possible enhancement in @xmath3 should be studied in the laboratory with neutron rich radioactive beams .    in section [ md ]",
    "we modeled the structure of the crust with molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we find that the crust of accreting neutron stars may contain micro - crystals or regions of phase separation .",
    "nevertheless , the screening factors that we determined for the enhancement of the rate of thermonuclear reactions are insensitive to these features",
    ". finally , we calculated in section [ reaction rates ] the rate of thermonuclear @xmath4o + @xmath4o fusion and find that @xmath4o should burn at densities near @xmath6 g/@xmath7 .",
    "this is a lower density than some previous estimates .",
    "the 0.52 mev per nucleon energy released may be important for the temperature profile of the star . in future work",
    ", we will use our molecular dynamics results to study other properties of the crust such as its thermal conductivity .",
    "in addition , we will use these md results to calculate pycnonuclear reaction rates for the fusion of @xmath5ne and other heavier nuclei .",
