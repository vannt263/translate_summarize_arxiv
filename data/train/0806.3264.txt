    "at high temperature , strongly interacting matter undergoes a transition from a confining , chiral symmetry broken phase to a phase which is chirally symmetric and deconfining in nature . for pure gluonic matter as well as for qcd with massless quarks",
    "this transition is known to be a genuine phase transition , while for qcd with physical quark masses it is most likely only a smooth ( though rapid ) crossover @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "thermodynamic observables like energy and entropy density show a sharp increase at the transition point , but approach the expected behavior of an asymptotically free quark - gluon gas only at very high temperatures .",
    "the phase just above @xmath3 is more complicated than a weakly interacting gas of quarks and gluons .",
    "non - perturbative features like the ( debye ) screening of electric modes as well as the possible appearance of a mass gap in the magnetic sector give rise to well - known problems that make a straightforward perturbative analysis of the high temperature phase of qcd fail .",
    "while infrared divergences arising at a momentum scale @xmath4 can still be taken into account by resummation @xcite , the softer modes at scale @xmath5 reflect genuine non - perturbative physics and can not be handled by any resummation @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative physics arising from the magnetic sector of qcd shows up at distances that are large on the scale of the inverse temperature , @xmath6 .",
    "it finds its most prominent reflection in the survival of an area law behavior for space - like wilson loops , _",
    "i.e. _ confinement of magnetic modes .",
    "the spatial string tension , @xmath7 , extracted from the area law behavior of spatial wilson loops , has been studied early on in lattice calculations performed in the pure gauge sector of qcd @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the temperature dependence of @xmath7 in su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge theories @xcite showed the expected dependence on the magnetic scale @xmath8 and established a close relation to the string tension of a 3-dimensional gauge theory . a recent detailed comparison of @xmath9 , calculated in lattice regularized qcd , with calculations performed in the framework of dimensionally reduced qcd @xcite was extremely successful in describing the temperature dependence of @xmath9 quantitatively even at temperatures close to the transition temperature .",
    "dimensional reduction makes very specific predictions for modifications induced in the magnetic sector of qcd through the presence of fermion degrees of freedom , quarks .",
    "in fact , modifications are expected to be small and the dominant structure of e.g. the spatial string tension is still expected to be controlled by a purely gluonic , 3-dimensional su(3 ) gauge theory . a possible source for failure",
    "has , however , been discussed in the past @xcite ; dynamical quarks , more precisely quark anti - quark pairs , can give rise to additional light bosonic quasi - particle modes that are not described by a 3-dimensional gauge theory .",
    "this makes it interesting to check to what extent dimensional reduction also is capable of describing physics in the magnetic sector of qcd in the presence of light dynamical quarks .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the spatial string tension in qcd with light dynamical quarks . for the first time we cover in such an analysis a large temperature range and perform calculations at three values of the lattice cut - off",

    "some preliminary results of this work have been presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a brief discussion of the concepts of dimensional reduction as far as they are relevant for this work and the analysis of the spatial string tension . in section",
    "iii we present details of our calculation of spatial pseudo - potentials and in section iv we discuss the determination of the spatial string from them .",

    "the different non - perturbative length scales of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , that one encounters in the perturbative analysis of qcd at high temperature are convenient for the reformulation of qcd in terms of a hierarchy of effective field theories that clearly separate the physics at these different scales @xcite .",
    "this allows the disentanglement of sectors that can be treated in perturbation theory from sectors that are only accessible to non - perturbative techniques .",
    "since the partition function of an equilibrium field theory can be written as an euclidean field theory with the time direction being a torus of extent @xmath12 , the temporal modes of fields are proportional to the matsubara frequencies , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an integer for bosonic and a half - integer for fermionic fields . at large temperatures , therefore , the non - static bosonic fields and the fermionic fields become very heavy and can be integrated out to get an effective theory for distance scales , and @xmath15 is a natural unit since the average spatial separation of partons in the high temperature phase is @xmath16 . ] @xmath17 which involves the static modes only @xcite .",

    "the confining nature of this theory is the origin of the infrared problem of high temperature qcd for momenta @xmath5 . at very high temperatures",
    "also the debye mass will be large , @xmath23 , and the heavy @xmath19 field can thus also be integrated out .",

    "in pure su(n ) gauge theory , the underlying nonperturbative structure of the high temperature theory can directly be seen in calculations of spatial wilson loops .",
    "the static @xmath30 energy in the finite temperature theory is given by wilson loops in space - time planes , @xmath31 , which are expected to satisfy a perimeter law above @xmath3 , thus signaling deconfinement .",

    "dimensional reduction therefore predicts = c g^2(t ) t [ eq.lo ] to leading order , where @xmath35 is the temperature - dependent running coupling of the four dimensional theory and @xmath34 is a constant that can be determined through a non - perturbative ( monte carlo ) calculation of wilson loops in a 3-dimensional su(3 ) gauge theory @xcite .",
    "already this tree level matching was found to be valid to a good accuracy at temperatures as low as @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "the situation may be somewhat different in qcd .",
    "while the quarks acquire an effective mass of @xmath40 , they make a qualitative difference in the long distance physics : since they provide a source for screening of fundamental charge , one expects that at sufficiently large distances @xmath41 ( spatial ) string breaking takes place , which can not be described by the effective theories @xmath42 or @xmath43 , respectively , as those do not include fundamental charges .",
    "of course , the distance ( in units of @xmath12 ) one needs to reach to observe this deviation increases with temperature , so it remains an important question to ask how well the ( spatial ) string tension of the four dimensional theory , extracted at large distances but before string breaking sets in , can be explained by the dimensionally reduced theory . in principle",
    "it is possible to write down the theory which includes also the lowest fermion matsubara frequency @xcite .",
    "this version of the dimensionally reduced theory would be able to describe the string breaking as well . at distances smaller than the string breaking scale , however , and given the weak dependence of the 3d gauge fields on the dynamics of the adjoint scalar fields discussed above we would expect that the presence of fermionic modes with mass of @xmath40 will have very little influence on wilson loops , and the spatial string tension extracted from them . on the other hand , from a comparison of screening masses in a theory with @xmath22",

    "thus , the question of an effective description of spatial wilson loops in terms of a dimensionally reduced theory at not - too - large temperatures is not settled and needs to be treated more extensively for qcd .",
    "we have carried out a study of the spatial wilson loops for qcd in the temperature interval [ @xmath44 . in this study",

    "is expected to change from a @xmath73 behavior appropriate in 4 dimensions to a logarithmic @xmath55 dependence in an effectively 3 dimensional theory .",
    "it is this gradual change in the short and intermediate distance part of the pseudo - potential that is responsible for ambiguities in the fit ansatz .",
    "we will discuss in the following our strategy to deal with this ambiguity .    from our data , we could not clearly disentangle a @xmath82 term from a @xmath73 behavior .",
