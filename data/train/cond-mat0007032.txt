    "it is by now quite evident through numerous experiments on electronic properties that cuprates , being superconductors at high temperatures , are also strange metals in the normal phase @xcite . on the other hand it also appears that most features can be well represented by prototype single - band models of correlated electrons , as the hubbard model and the @xmath0-@xmath1 model . in spite of their apparent simplicity",
    "these models are notoriously difficult to treat analytically , in particular in the most interesting regime of strong correlations .",
    "this has led to intensive efforts towards numerical approaches @xcite , mostly using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and the exact diagonalization ( ed ) methods .",
    "the subject of this contribution is the planar @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( hubbard model is expected to show similar behaviour in the strong correlation regime ) , which represents layered cuprates as doped antiferromagnets ( afm ) and within a single band both mobile charges and spin degrees of freedom , @xmath2 strong correlations are here imposed by strictly forbidding doubly occupied sites .",
    "so far most calculations were performed for the ground state at @xmath3 , where the standard lanczos algorithm offers an efficient exact - diagonalization analysis of small systems @xcite .",
    "more recently a novel numerical method , finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) @xcite , has been introduced combining the lanczos method with a random sampling , which allows for an analogous treatment of static and dynamic properties at @xmath4 .",
    "one of most important conclusion of experimental efforts in the last decade is the realization that the electronic phase diagram in the paramater space of planar hole concentration @xmath5 and temperature @xmath6 is quite universal .",
    "materials are usually classified as underdoped , optimally doped and overdoped , with respect to the highest @xmath7 in a given class . in our analysis",
    "we can not establish the superconductivity , so we will use the highest entropy ( at low @xmath6 ) as a criterion for the optimum doping .",
    "in fact both criteria are quite close for real cuprates @xcite and one could conjecture that this relation is not accidental .",
    "in particular since in thermodynamic quantities at the same doping also the pseudogap scale disappears .    in this contribution",
    "we mainly discuss two topics related to the normal - state properties of cuprates . in sec.ii",
    "we deal with the thermodynamic quantities : entropy , chemical potential and closely related thermoelectric power , all of them in the full range of @xmath5 . in sec.iii",
    "we concentrate on the appearance and the relation between different manifestations of the marginal - fermi - liquid ( mfl ) behaviour , observed in the optical conductivity , dynamic spin susceptibility and spectral functions at the intermediate ( optimum ) doping .",
    "let us first consider thermodynamic quantities , which can be directly derived from the grand - canonical sum : free energy density @xmath8 , chemical potential @xmath9 and entropy density @xmath10 .",
    "for these the ftlm is particularly simple to implement @xcite , since it requires only a minor generalization of the usual lanczos method .",
    "results presented below were obtained mostly for @xmath11 sites and parameters @xmath12 , corresponding to the situation in cuprates ( where @xmath13ev ) .",
    "note that in small systems only results above certain ( size dependent ) @xmath6 are meaningful , i.e. in cases below typically @xmath14 .",
    "let us first discuss results for @xmath10 , shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) for various @xmath6 .",
    "it seems quite generic feature of such a system that @xmath15 exhibits a ( rather broad ) maximum at the intermediate doping @xmath16 .",
    "the increase of @xmath10 on doping can be plausibly related to the frustration between the afm exchange @xmath17 and the hole kinetic energy @xmath18 preferring the fm configuration .",
    "this naturally leads to a most frustrated situation at @xmath19 .",
    "it is quite fortunate that the ftlm works best , i.e. @xmath20 is lowest , just in the cases with large @xmath10 and large frustration , while other methods have difficulties in such situation .",
    "e.g. qmc is plagued with the minus - sign problem which seems to be intimately related to fermionic frustration .",
    "even more surprising fact is the magnitude of @xmath10 at @xmath21 .",
    "e.g. at @xmath22 at @xmath23 we get 40% of @xmath24 .",
    "clearly we are dealing with a system which has very low degeneracy ( fermi ) temperature @xmath25 , far below the free fermion value @xmath26 .",
    "such a conclusion is in agreement with experiments in cuprates . in recent years",
    "@xmath10 has been measured in ybco and lsco ( also presented in fig.([fig1 ] ) in a wide doping regime @xcite and our results show good quantitative agreement .    for @xmath27 , presented in fig.([fig2 ] ) , we mostly do not find a @xmath28 dependence of @xmath29 at low @xmath6 , as expected for a normal fermi liquid , except within the extremely overdoped regime @xmath30 . in particular , in a broad range @xmath31 we find a roughly linear variation @xmath32 , whereby the slope @xmath33 changes the sign at @xmath34 .",
    "the variation @xmath35 at low @xmath6 has been recently deduced experimentally from the shift of photoemission spectroscopy spectra in lsco @xcite , and the agreement with our results is quite satisfactory @xcite . from photoemission results as well as from our fig.([fig2 ] ) it is also evident that @xmath36 is very flat which would indicate that at @xmath37 and @xmath38 the compressibility @xmath39 is very large or even diverging , as would e.g. follow from the phase separation scenario @xcite or the singular @xmath40 limit @xcite .",
    "it should be however stressed that the distinction between these scenarios could be relevant only at very low @xmath41 , since both experiment and numerics indicate on quite large @xmath10 , i.e. a distribution over a wide spectrum of states , even at @xmath42 .",
    "it is quite helpful to realize that the free energy density @xmath43 relates the variation of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 this connects the maximum @xmath47 with the change in slope @xmath48 .",
    "moreover eq.([eq2 ] ) allows us to discuss more confidently the slope @xmath49 for which we find in the underdoped regime @xmath50 .",
    "although the latter has not been so far verified directly for cuprates , one can extract in the same regime from the measured @xmath51 for lsco and ybco at @xmath52 similar values @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "it is quite evident that at @xmath54 we are not dealing with a degenerate fermi liquid but rather with the nondegenerate doped carriers , which is a situation typical for a doped ( nondegenerate ) semiconductor .",
    "one should just recall the standard expression for @xmath29 in p - type semiconductor , @xmath55 where in our notation @xmath56 .",
    "the constant slope @xmath57 observed in our calculations down to @xmath58 is a confirmation of such a picture . in experimental results for @xmath10",
    "one should however notice a reduction of @xmath33 with @xmath6 , but even at @xmath59 the system is not evidently a normal fermi liquid with @xmath60 .",
    "another consequence of such a semiconductor picture is an expression for the thermopower @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the validity of this approximation we have verified within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model also directly by evaluating the mixed current - energy current correlation function and observing that they are proportional to the current - current correlation @xmath64 . the result is in fig.([fig3 ] ) is good agreement with the general experimental observation in cuprates @xcite of a large and rather @xmath6-independent @xmath61 at low doping .",
    "in fact instead of the usual semiconductor expression for @xmath33 at @xmath65 , eq.([eq4 ] ) , in a strongly correlated system it is more appropriate to use the proper statistics for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model leading to @xmath66 $ ] , which even predicts the change of sign at @xmath67 .",
    "it has been quite early established from experiments that cuprates in the normal state do not follow the behaviour consistent with the normal fermi liquid . in contrast several static and dynamic quantities at optimum doping can be quite well accounted for within the marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) concept @xcite .",
    "most evident example is the dynamic conductivity @xmath68 which does not obey the usual drude form with a constant rate @xmath69 but can be well fitted in a broad range of @xmath70 with the generalized mfl form @xmath71 , describing also the well established linear resistivity law @xmath72 .",
    "it has been natural to postulate an analogous mfl behaviour for quasiparticle ( qp ) relaxation in spectral functions as e.g. measured by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . only recently",
    ", however , the high resolution arpes experiments on bscco @xcite seem to be in position to confirm beyond doubt this behaviour , obeyed in the optimum - doped materials surprisingly even at @xmath73 for qp along the nodal direction in the brillouin zone .",
    "most evident indication that also spin dynamics follows the mfl concept is the observed anomalous nmr and nqr spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath74 @xcite instead of usual korringa law in metals .    by calculating using ftlm several related quantities ,",
    "descibing charge and spin dynamics within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , we established that the mfl concept applies well in a broad range of intermediate hole doping @xmath75 .",
    "we discuss here in particular the dynamical conductivity @xmath68 , the local spin susceptibility @xmath76 @xcite and the qp relaxation rate as obtained from the analysis of spectral functions @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 has been been found close to a universal form @xcite , @xmath78 in a remarkably broad frequency regime @xmath79 , while @xmath80 is essentially @xmath6-independent for @xmath21 .",
    "resulting @xmath81 is clearly governed by @xmath6 only .",
    "evidently , eq.([eq5 ] ) reproduces the linear resistivity law @xmath82 and is consistent with the mfl scenario for @xmath83 , however in a very restrictive way since both mfl parameters are essentially fixed .",
    "a reasonable overall fit can be e.g. achieved by @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "when optical experiments on @xmath68 in cuprates are analysed within the mfl framework quite close values for @xmath86 are in fact reported @xcite .",
    "in addition , the model results reproduce well also the absolute value of @xmath68 and @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "analogous universality has been found also in the spin dynamics , in particular when looking at the local spin susceptibility @xmath76 and related spin correlation function @xmath88 , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the symmetrized function , having a fixed sum rule @xmath91 the most important message of numerical results on spin dynamics at intermediate doping is that @xmath92 is nearly @xmath6-independent in a broad range of @xmath6 , in particular for @xmath21 .",
    "moreover @xmath92 is only weakly doping dependent consistent with the sum rule .",
    "so we have a conclusion that at intermediate doping the more fundamental and universal quantity is the correlation function @xmath88 and not the susceptibility @xmath76 , which is the analogy to the relation between @xmath93 and @xmath68 in eq.([eq5 ] ) .",
    "for the spin dynamics this is also the message of the anomalous nmr @xmath94 in cuprates @xcite . as a result @xmath95 , eq.([eq6 ] ) , follows the mfl behaviour i.e. at @xmath96 one gets anomalous @xmath6 dependence @xmath97 .",
    "a mfl - type qp relaxation is extracted within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model also from the analysis of the spectral functions @xmath77 near the optimum doping @xcite . for the characterization of qp properties",
    "the self energy @xmath98 is crucial . on the other hand",
    "the same information can be also expressed in terms of qp parameters @xmath99 .",
    "both definitions are related as @xmath100 for qp near the fermi surface the hole - part self energy @xmath101 is found to be of the mfl form , i.e. im@xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 means an overdamped character of qp , since the the full width at half maximum @xmath106 is larger than the qp ( binding ) energy @xmath107 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the electron - like regime @xmath108 where the damping is found to be essentially smaller and consequently qp can be underdamped .    here",
    "we comment on the relation of our results to recent arpes results in bscco .",
    "the analysis for hole - like excitations in the nodal direction @xmath109 shows the mfl form with the qp damping @xmath110 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this again means an overdamped character of hole excitations , since @xmath113 . in making the comparison one should take into account that @xmath114 . since at the peak position we find @xmath115 experimental and model values appear reasonably close",
    "let us finally discuss the relation of @xmath68 and the associated relaxation rate @xmath69 to the qp damping @xmath116 @xcite . in the case of",
    "weak scattering one finds @xmath117 . in cuprates as well in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model we are apparently dealing with overdamped qp , so the relation is at least questionable .",
    "also , the conductivity form eq.([eq5 ] ) appears to be universal , while the qp damping does not seem to be parameter free .",
    "one approach is to approximate the current - current correlation function @xmath93 , which in general replaces @xmath80 in eq.([eq5 ] ) , by a decoupling in terms of spectral functions @xmath118 neglecting possible vertex corrections , i.e. @xmath119 in order to reproduce the mfl form of @xmath68 one has to assume the mfl form for the spectral function , eq.([eq8 ] ) , i.e. the qp damping of the form @xmath120 .",
    "we neglect also the @xmath121 dependence of @xmath116 and @xmath122 .",
    "in fact it is enough to assume that @xmath123 is independent of deviations @xmath124 perpendicular to the fermi surface .",
    "the latter is just what is observed in recent arpes studies of bscco @xcite .",
    "replacing in eq.([eq9 ] ) the @xmath121 summation with an integral over @xmath107 with a slowly varying density of states we can derive @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "we are thus dealing with a function @xmath93 depending only on the ratio @xmath127 , and on mfl parameters @xmath128 .",
    "for @xmath129 we recover via such an analysis @xmath93 strongly peaked at @xmath130 and consequently mfl - type @xmath68 with @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "no such simple relation is valid when one approaches the regime of overdamped qp excitations @xmath132 or more appropriate @xmath133 . in fig.([fig4 ] ) we show results for several @xmath134 fixing @xmath135 . for @xmath136",
    "still a pronounced peak shows up at @xmath137 , on the other hand @xmath93 becomes for @xmath138 nearly constant or very slowly varying in a broad range of @xmath127 .",
    "the main message of the above simple analysis is that for systems with overdamped qp excitations the universal form ( [ eq5 ] ) describes quite well @xmath68 for a wide range of parameters .",
    "it should be stressed that nearly constant @xmath139 also means that the current relaxation rate @xmath140 is very large , @xmath141 , i.e. much larger than the conductivity relaxation scale apparent from eq.([eq5 ] ) where @xmath142 follows solely from thermodynamics .",
    "one should also be aware of the upper cutoff scale @xmath143 for the validity of the mfl - like qp damping . in the problem considered here",
    "it appears that the cutoff is directly related to the current relaxation rate @xmath144 found in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model to be extremely high at the intermediate doping , i.e. @xmath145 . the latter allows for an effective mean free path @xmath146 of only few cells , essentially independent of @xmath6 .",
    "such a short @xmath146 can be plausibly explained by assuming that charge carriers - holes entirely loose the phase coherence in collisions with each other due to the randomizing effect of an incoherent spin background .",
    "note again that the short correlation length ( even at @xmath147 ) appears also from the analysis of arpes spectral functions @xmath77 varying @xmath148 along the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "cuprates in their metallic phase are anomalous in several respects .",
    "one important conclusion at least for theoreticians is that most of anomalous properties are quite well reproduced also in the prototype @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the analysis of this model has been so far restricted to numerical calculations of small systems , nevertheless in the @xmath149 window where macroscopic relevance of ftlm results is expected the agreement with experiments is even quantitative , without any adjustable parameters . since the behaviour found experimentally",
    "is quite generic and universal down to lowest @xmath59 there is no reason to doubt in the generality of model results .",
    "nevertheless there are open questions of the existence and the origin of low energy scales in cuprates as well as in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model . in the underdoped or",
    "weakly doped regime ftlm shows the indication for the pseudogap scale @xmath150 , in particular in the uniform susceptibility @xmath151 and in the density of states @xcite .",
    "this scale seems to be related to the onset of short range afm correlations , hence @xmath152 .",
    "still for @xmath153 the entropy remains large as manifested by experiments and our results .",
    "the electron liquid is thus closer to a nondegenerate system of composite particles than to a degenerate fermi gas . only at @xmath154",
    "the entropy is low enough to make the discussion of possible orderings or instabilities relevant .",
    "the origin of the mfl behaviour of several dynamic quantities and of the universal form of @xmath68 and @xmath76 in the intermediate doping has to be intimately related to the large degeneracy in this regime .",
    "it has been shown that qp are essentially overdamped down to lowest @xmath59 .",
    "this can be only explained by the scattering on spin fluctuations , which mainly contribute to the entropy .",
    "on the other hand spins are just strongly perturbed by holes introduced by doping , so a self - consistent enhancement seems to be the mechanism which dominates the relevant physics . only at low @xmath155",
    "apparently this behaviour breaks down by an emergence of coherence and new energy scales .",
