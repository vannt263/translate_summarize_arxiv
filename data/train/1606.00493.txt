    "<S> a challenge of molecular self - assembly is to understand how to design particles that self - assemble into a desired structure and not any of a potentially large number of undesired structures . </S>",
    "<S> here we use simulation to show that a strategy of _ minimal positive design _ allows the self - assembly of networks equivalent to the 8 semiregular archimedean tilings of the plane , structures not previously realized in simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy consists of identifying the fewest distinct types of interparticle interaction that appear in the desired structure , and does not require enumeration of the many possible undesired structures . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting particles , which self - assemble into the desired networks , possess dna - like selectivity of their interactions . </S>",
    "<S> assembly of certain molecular networks may therefore require such selectivity .    </S>",
    "<S> molecular self - assembly is the spontaneous organization of molecules or other small particles into structures . despite many successes in the laboratory </S>",
    "<S> we lack complete understanding of how to design particles that will self - assemble into a desired structure : sometimes the outcome of self - assembly is an undesired structure , which might be metastable or kinetically trappedwhitelam2015statistical . </S>",
    "<S> simulation can help us understand how particle design influences the process and outcome of self - assemblydoye2004inhibition , hagan2006dynamic , doye2007condensed , rapaport2010modeling , reinhardt2014numerical , murugan2015undesired . </S>",
    "<S> the concept is simple to implement : we drew pictures of the desired structures and labeled the interparticle interactions that arise , and then ( on the computer ) made particles with those interactions _ and no others_. those particles self - assembled , under a simple cooling protocol , into the desired structures , which had not previously been realized in simulationantlanger2011stability .        </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the concept of minimal positive design by considering the self - assembly of networks equivalent to tilings of the planegrunbaum1977tilings , kepler1938harmonice . </S>",
    "<S> such networks are complex geometrically , and so pose a challenge for design , and their experimental realizations , via the self - assembly of real molecules at surfaces , have useful propertiescija2013five , elemans2009molecular , bartels2010tailoring , whitelam2014common . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest tilings of the plane are the 3 platonic tilings , which consist of regular triangles , squares or hexagons . </S>",
    "<S> the networks equivalent to these tilings can be self - assembled from _ patchy particles _ </S>",
    "<S> , model molecules with anisotropic pairwise interactionszhang2004self , doye2007controlling , bianchi2008theoretical , duguet2016patchy , that possess regular sixfold , fourfold or threefold rotational symmetry , respectivelydoppelbauer2010self , antlanger2011stability , doye2007controlling , whitelam2015emergent . </S>",
    "<S> evident here is the concept of positive design : particles have the same rotational symmetry as the vertices of the network equivalent to the edges of the tiling . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the formation of alternative structures is avoided during self - assembly , and the desired networks spontaneously appear .    </S>",
    "<S> networks equivalent to the 8 archimedean tilings of the plane pose a sterner challenge for design . </S>",
    "<S> these tilings , sections of which are shown in , are composed of two or three polygon types , but only one type of vertexgrunbaum1977tilings . in principle , therefore , they can be made from a single type of particle  . </S>",
    "<S> however , ref.antlanger2011stability showed that patchy particles whose interaction geometries are those of the vertices of these tilings are not in general thermodynamically stable in network form , tending instead to form more compact undesired structures . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with this observation we found that such particles do not in general self - assemble into networks equivalent to the archimedean tilings .        </S>",
    "<S> the concept of minimal positive design can be used to overcome this problem . in ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> we show a section of a network equivalent ( in an averaged sense ) to the @xmath0 archimedean tiling . </S>",
    "<S> archimedean tilings are designated @xmath1 , meaning that as we move in a circle around any vertex we encounter a regular @xmath2-gon , followed by a regular @xmath3-gon , and so on , ending with a regular @xmath4-gongrunbaum1977tilings . </S>",
    "<S> the network shown is made from a 4-patch particle with an angle of @xmath5 between the bisectors of patches 0 and 1 , an angle of @xmath6 between the bisectors of patches 1 and 2 , an angle of @xmath7 between the bisectors of patches 2 and 3 , and ( therefore ) an angle of @xmath6 between the bisectors of patches 3 and 0 ; here @xmath8 is the internal angle of a regular @xmath9-gon . we shall call this a @xmath0 particle . in general , as noted inantlanger2011stability , a vertex of an archimedean tiling @xmath1 can be made from a patchy particle of the same destination , i.e. one with @xmath10 patches whose bisectors are separated by angles @xmath11 ( we label patches by integers @xmath12 so that @xmath13 is the angle between the bisectors of patches @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with patch @xmath10 being also patch 0 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if all patches of the particle shown in ( a ) attract all other patches then the particle can participate in undesired networks like that shown in ( b ) , and in a large number of disordered networks . </S>",
    "<S> such networks compete thermodynamically with the target structureantlanger2011stability , or act as traps that kinetically arrest assembly . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> looking again at ( a ) we see that not all patch - patch interactions appear in the @xmath0 tiling : only the pairs 0:1 and 2:3 do so . </S>",
    "<S> if we construct a patchy particle whose patches are chemically selective in that way , allowing only attractions between patch 0 and 1 and between patch 2 and 3 , then , as shown in ( c ) , it self - assembles into the desired network . </S>",
    "<S> this chemical selectivity is the _ minimal _ element in the strategy of minimal positive design . </S>",
    "<S> absent this selectivity the self - assembly process results in the undesired structure shown in ( d ) .        </S>",
    "<S> .interactions for the minimal positive design of the archimedean tilings . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    the simulation model used to make these figures is similar to that used in ref.whitelam2015emergent . </S>",
    "<S> the particles in question are hard discs of diameter @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> particles attract each other via patches of opening angle @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> particle interactions are square - well in both anglekern2003fluid and range , and they are chemically selective : particles possess a pairwise attraction of energy @xmath18 if 1 ) two disc centers lie within a distance @xmath19 ; if 2 ) the line joining those two discs cuts through one patch on each disc ; and if 3 ) the patch - patch pairs are those shown in table  [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> patches engaged in this manner are shown green in figures , and those not engaged are shown black . for illustrative purposes we sometimes draw the convex polygons that result from joining the centers of bound discs . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation protocol we used is designed to mimic the deposition and assembly of real molecules on surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we work in the @xmath20 ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we start with an empty substrate and allow particles to appear and disappear on it using grand - canonical monte carlo movesfrenkel1996understanding . </S>",
    "<S> we allow particles to move on the substrate using the virtual - move monte carlo algorithm described in the appendix of ref.whitelam2009role ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> we started the simulation with a small value of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and a chemical potential chosen so that the substrate is sparsely occupied with particles , and we ` cooled ' the system slowly by increasing @xmath21 by a value of @xmath23 every million monte carlo steps ( ) . eventually , we observe the self - assembly of a network structure .    inspection of the archimedean tilingsgrunbaum1977tilings reveals that the corresponding networks can be built from the particle geometries and interactions listed in table  [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we verified that particles of this nature self - assemble in simulations into networks equivalent to the archimedean tilings . </S>",
    "<S> sections of these networks are shown in ; simulation boxes from which these sections are taken are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> s1 . </S>",
    "<S> networks possess some disordered regions , such as grain boundaries , but otherwise cover large portions of the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> networks are porous , and in some of the larger pores we observe the assembly of smaller structures </S>",
    "<S> . pictures of the networks alone are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> s2 . </S>",
    "<S> most of these networks emerge via nucleation and growth of the ordered unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> one that does not is the 3.12.12 network , which self - assembles hierarchically : a network of triangles forms and subsequently rearranges to complete the 12-gons ; see .    </S>",
    "<S> one point of note , mentioned in ref.antlanger2011stability , is that the 4.6.12 tiling must be made from two types of vertex ( or particle ) , 4.6.12 and 4.12.6 . </S>",
    "<S> these vertices are usually considered equivalent in the mathematical literaturegrunbaum1977tilings , but the corresponding particles are distinct objects . </S>",
    "<S> thus the 4.6.12 tiling is unlike the other 7 archimedean tilings in that it requires at least two types of particle for its construction . </S>",
    "<S> the primes in the last row of table  [ tab1 ] indicate that the required attractive interactions are between the two types of particle . </S>",
    "<S> we used an equimolar mixture of the two particle types .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 we show the results of self - assembly done without the constraint of chemical selectivity </S>",
    "<S> . sections of the 3.3.3.4.4 and 3.3.4.3.4 tilings appear . </S>",
    "<S> the 3.6.3.6 tiling appears , albeit in competition with a rhombic polymorph ( which would be favored at finite pressureantlanger2011stability ) ; see fig . s4 . in general </S>",
    "<S> , however , we do not observe large - scale self - assembly of networks equivalent to the archimedean tilings .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the strategy of minimal positive design  geometry plus chemical selectivity </S>",
    "<S>  succeeds in self - assembling networks equivalent to the archimedean tilings where positive design alone  geometry  fails . </S>",
    "<S> the strategy of minimal positive design used here is simple to implement . </S>",
    "<S> it consists only of the enumeration of the interactions that occur in desired structures , and does not involve assessment of the thermodynamic stability of the desired structures , nor explicit consideration of possible competing structures ( ) . .    </S>",
