    "a wealth of experimental data on hadronic charmless @xmath0 decays has become available from the babar and belle experiments .",
    "these studies of the numerous @xmath0 decay channels are designed to test the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) explanation of @xmath1 violation in the standard model as represented by the unitarity triangle condition @xmath2 on the ckm mixing parameters .",
    "such tests have been facilitated by the recent significant progress in the theoretical understanding of hadronic decay amplitudes based upon qcd factorization which allows the amplitudes to be expressed in terms of numerous soft qcd parameters , such as meson decay constants and transition form factors , and a set of calculable coefficients . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of recent data , based upon qcd factorization .",
    "we also investigate the potential contribution to the decay amplitudes of @xmath3 quark annihilation and so - called charming penguins .",
    "the data that we attempt to fit includes decays to pseudoscalar ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and vector ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) mesons .",
    "this is an extension of an earlier study @xcite that was based upon simplified formulae derived from the heavy quark limit of qcd factorization .",

    "the other terms indicated in ( [ heff ] ) include the electromagnetic and chromomagnetic dipole transition operators . in the standard model the contributions from the electroweak penguin operators and magnetic dipole operators are generally small .",
    "the exception is the electroweak penguin operator coefficient @xmath22 which is larger than the qcd penguin coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it has been shown by beneke _",

    "qcd factorization extends naive factorization by separating matrix elements into short distance contributions at scale @xmath27 that are perturbatively calculable and long distance contributions @xmath28 that are parameterized .",
    "@xmath0 meson decay can also be initiated by @xmath3 quark annihilation with its partner .",
    "although the annihilation contributions to the decay amplitude are formally of @xmath29 and power suppressed , they violate qcd factorization because of end point divergences . however these weak annihilation contributions can be included into the decay amplitudes by treating the end point divergences as phenomenological parameters .",
    "analyses based upon qcd factorization with inclusion of weak annihilation have been undertaken for @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "although general agreement with experiment was found , some branching ratios for @xmath32 decays were only marginally consistent and all predictions were plagued by the large uncertainties associated with poorly determined parameters within the theory",
    ". a recent global analysis of @xmath33 and @xmath32 decays @xcite found that qcd factorization plus weak annihilation could fit many decay channels but yielded results too low for the @xmath34 decays .",
    "more recently , aleksan _",
    "@xcite have undertaken a global analysis of @xmath32 decays and have concluded that qcd factorization can not fit the experimental data when decay channels involving @xmath35 mesons are included , and suggest that this failure is due to some larger than expected nonperturbative contribution .",
    "motivated by the concept of so - called charming penguins , that is non - perturbative @xmath29 corrections from enhanced @xmath36-loop penguins , first introduced by ciuchini _",
    "@xcite , they introduce additional long - distance contributions to the decay amplitudes and include the two complex parameters from these additional amplitudes in their global fit .",
    "they obtain a slightly better fit but their best - fit parameters are at the limits of the allowed domain .",
    "a recent study @xcite , limited to @xmath37 decays , has used qcd factorization to place bounds on the @xmath38 form factor .",
    "a detailed study of qcd factorization applied to @xmath33 and @xmath32 decays of @xmath0 mesons has just been completed by beneke and neubert @xcite .",
    "predicted branching ratios and @xmath1 asymmetries for a large number of @xmath33 and @xmath32 channels are given for default values of input parameters and detailed estimates of the theoretical uncertainties in these predictions determined for various scenarios of input parameters .",
    "beneke and neubert find that there is a scenario for which there is general global agreement between the results of qcd factorization and measurement except for @xmath39 and the group of @xmath34 decays .",
    "in this paper we undertake a global analysis of 18 @xmath33 , @xmath32 and @xmath40 channels using two theoretical models , ( i ) qcd factorization with inclusion of weak annihilation and ( ii ) this model supplemented with charming penguins .",
    "our study is similar in spirit to that of aleksan _ et al . _",
