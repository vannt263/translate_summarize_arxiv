    "during recent years the two - photon decay processes in hydrogen have attracted special attention due to new and very accurate observations of the cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization anisotropies @xcite . in view of these observations",
    "it becomes important to understand the hydrogen recombination history with high precision . in the early universe",
    "the strong lyman - alpha @xmath2 transition did not permit the atoms to remain in their ground states : each photon released in such a transition in one atom was immediately absorbed by another one .",
    "however , due to the very weak @xmath3 two - photon decay process the radiation could finally decouple from the interaction with matter and thus permit a successful recombination .",
    "the role of the @xmath3 two - photon decay was first established in @xcite .",
    "the other two - photon channels , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 decays were also discussed in @xcite-@xcite . at the present level of accuracy reached in the astrophysical observations these contributions also become important .",
    "a crucial difference between the decay of the @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 , similar for @xmath8 ) and the @xmath9 levels consists in the presence of the cascade transitions as the dominant decay channels . in case of the @xmath9",
    "level the cascade transitions are absent .",
    "since the cascade photons can be effectively reabsorbed , the problem of separating the `` pure '' two - photon contribution from the cascade contribution arises .",
    "an interference between the two decay channels , i.e. `` pure '' two - photon decay and cascade , should also be taken into account .",
    "a similar problem did arise within the theory of the two - electron highly charged ions ( hci ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "drake @xcite evaluated for the first time the two - photon e1m1 transition in the presence of a cascade transition in he - like uranium ion ( @xmath10 ) . later savukov and johnson preformed similar calculation for a variety of he - like hci ( @xmath11 ) @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the `` pure '' two - photon contribution was obtained by subtracting off a lorentzian fit for the cascade contribution from the total two - photon decay frequency distribution .",
    "the existence of the interference terms was recognized in @xcite , but only approximately included in the lorentzian fit as an asymmetric deviation from the pure lorentzian .",
    "a rigorous qed approach for the evaluation of two - photon decay width with cascades was developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this approach was based on the standard evaluation of the decay probability as a transition probability to the lower levels . in case of cascades",
    "the integral over emitted photon frequency distribution becomes divergent due to the singular terms , corresponding to the cascade resonances .",
    "to avoid such a singularity , the resummation of an infinite series of the electron self - energy insertions was performed in @xcite .",
    "this resummation converts into a geometric progression and in this way the self - energy insertion ( and the level width as its imaginary part ) enters in the energy denominator and shifts the pole on the real axis into the complex energy plane , thus making the integral finite . with this approach f. low",
    "first derived the lorentz profile from qed @xcite . in @xcite the level widths in the singular energy denominators",
    "were also introduced , though without special justification .",
    "similarly , i.e. by introducion of the level widths in the singular energy denominators the two - photon decay of @xmath6 and @xmath8 excited levels in hydrogen was evaluated most recently in the astrophysical papers @xcite .    in @xcite the ambiguity of the separation of the `` pure '' two - photon decay and cascades",
    "was first revealed for hci , where it was shown that the interference terms can essentially contribute to the total decay probability .",
    "the full qed treatment of the two - photon decay process with inclusion of cascades and interference terms was performed in @xcite for the hydrogen atom . however , in @xcite the ambiguity of separation of the `` pure '' two - photon decay was neither emphasized nor demonstrated explicitly .",
    "this will be subject of the present paper .",
    "our numerical results for @xmath0-level in hydrogen are in agreement with the most accurate recent calculations in @xcite ( see section 11 below ) .",
    "however , our results disagree strongly with the value obtained in @xcite .",
    "the result in @xcite follows from the `` alternative '' approach to the evaluation of the two - photon decay , developed by jentschura @xcite .",
    "this `` alternative '' approach is based on the evaluation of the imaginary part of the two - loop lanb shift for @xmath0-level .",
    "the idea to use the imaginary part of the lamb shift for calculating the radiative corrections to the one - photon transitions is due to barbieri and sucher @xcite and is definitely adequate for this propose .",
    "later this approach was used in @xcite for hci . still , the extension of this approach to the evaluation of the two - photon decay width , when the cascade transitions are also present , is more involved and requires special care . in @xcite",
    "it was claimed that the singularity in the integration over the photon frequency distribution for the two - photon decay is absent and thus the finite integral represents directly the `` pure '' two - photon decay rate .",
    "also this statement forced us to perform a careful revision of the evaluation of the two - photon decay width via the imaginary part of the second order lamb shift , which will be presented below in sections 6 - 10 . in our approach",
    "we employed the consequences of the `` optical theorem '' for the @xmath12-matrix and the gell - mann and low adiabatic formula @xcite for the evaluation of the energy level shift via @xmath12-matrix .",
    "the results of our analysis , unlike jentschura s derivations , reveal that the evaluation of the two - photon decay width via the imaginary part of the lamb shift provides identical expressions as the standard qed description via summation of transition probabilities .",
    "the integration over the emitted photon frequency for the two - photon decay with cascades remains divergent and requires the introduction of the level widths in the singular energy denominators ( resummation of qed - radiative corrections ) .",
    "the detailed derivations employing both methods ( summation of transition probabilities and evaluation of the imaginary part of the lamb shift ) are given and numerical results for the @xmath0-level in hydrogen are provided .",
    "these results demonstrate clearly the ambiguity of the separation of the `` pure '' two - photon and cascade contributions with accuracy , required for the modern astrophysical investigations ( i.e. 1% ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shortly review the standard derivation of the excited atomic level one - photon width via the summation over transition probabilities to the lower levels .",
    "this presentation of formulas , though available in text - books on quantum electrodynamics , are necessary for the further comparison with the results obtained by another approaches .",
    "it is for the readers convenience to make the paper self - contained and allowing to follow our derivations without consulting additioanl literature .",
    "the same is done ( even in a more compressed way ) in the section iii for the two - photon decay width . in section 4",
    "we repeat ( again very briefly ) the standard understanding of the situation for the two - photon decay with cascades and present the formulas employed for the appropriate calculations in the numerous works on the subject , beginning from @xcite .",
    "for justification of this procedure we follow @xcite . in section 5",
    "we evaluate the one - photon decay width via the imaginary part of the lamb shift .",
    "this is again a well - known result but it will be also necessary to confirm our further derivations . in this section",
    "we follow derivations of @xcite in a more condensed way .    in section",
    "vi we evaluate the imaginary part of the energy level shift employing the adiabatic formula of gell - mann and low .",
    "the key idea of our approach - the application of the `` optical theorem '' - is formulated in section vii .",
    "actually , we employ here the unitarity of the adiabatic @xmath12-matrix .",
    "the formulated approach is applied to the evaluation of the one - photon width in the section viii , to the evaluation of the two - photon width ( without cascades ) in section ix and to the evaluation of the two - photon width ( with cascades ) in section x. in these sections we compare our derivations with the standard qed derivations and analyse the discrepance with jentschura s results in section x. in section xi the numerical results for the @xmath0-level in hydrogen are given and the ambiguity of separation the `` pure '' two - photon and cascade contributions is demonstrated .",
    "finally , in section xii we formulate our version of the problem of the cascade separation in astrophysics and present our recommendations for the resolution of this problem .",
    "relativistic units @xmath13 are employed .",

    "the transition amplitude @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40    the transition probability can not be defined straightforeward as @xmath41 , since the square of a @xmath42-function is actually meaningless .",

    "it is natural then to introduce the transition probability per time unit ( transition rate ) by definition @xmath51 we will compare this definition with another one in section 8 .",
