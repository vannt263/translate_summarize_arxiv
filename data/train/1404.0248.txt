    "during merging processes leading to the formation of clusters of galaxies , large amounts of gravitational energy are released on timescales of the order of @xmath3gyr .",
    "most of this energy is contained in hot ( temperatures @xmath4kev ) x - ray  emitting plasma which constitutes , along with the dark matter , the dominant fraction of the intracluster medium ( icm ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the thermal gas , however , @xmath5 g magnetic fields and ultrarelativistic electrons are present within the icm as well , manifesting most clearly in extended diffuse radio structures such as giant and mini radio halos in the central parts of clusters , or radio relics at cluster peripheries ( see the reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "these non - thermal constituents of the icm are believe to be related to the energy dissipation processes enabled by large - scale shocks formed at the outskirts of merging systems , and/or turbulence driven by various mechanisms at early post - merger stages of a cluster lifetime .",
    "the presence of ( or rather the amount of ) hadronic cosmic rays in the diffuse cluster environment is still an open question , being currently probed with new - generation @xmath6-ray instruments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    besides",
    "radio halos and relics , extended lobes and plumes of radio galaxies make up yet another class of diffuse non - thermal structures often found in the icm .",
    "these are formed due to the jet activity of accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) hosted by the cluster galaxies .",
    "the large - scale morphologies of such lobes are rarely regular or symmetric , unlike in the case of ` classical doubles ' typical for poorer ( galaxy group ) environments .",
    "instead , lobes of cluster radio galaxies are often bent ( ` tailed ' radio sources ) , irregular , or even amorphous , reflecting the dramatic impact of high - pressure ambient medium , high peculiar velocities of parent galaxies , and highly intermittent jet activity of cluster smbhs ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the discussion in  5.3 below ) .",
    "such structures may therefore be considered as useful probes of the dynamical state and structure of the icm , or even as effective tracers of galaxy clusters at moderate and high redshifts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . since they are best characterized at low radio frequencies , the operation of the next generation of low - frequency interferometers like the low frequency array @xcite and the murchison widefield array @xcite are in this context much anticipated .",
    "recently , much attention has been given to radio sources located within the central parts of galaxy clusters , since the mechanical energy output of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which are hosted by central elliptical ( cd ) galaxies is widely believed to be responsible for suppressing the cluster cooling flows , quenching the star - formation in cd systems and the growth of their smbhs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to investigate the details of such feedback processes ,",
    "a precise spectral and morphological characterization of central radio structures and of their surroundings is however obligatory , and this requires deep high - resolution exposures with various instruments operating from radio to x - ray bands . without such extensive dataset ,",
    "the physics of the lobes - icm interactions may remain elusive .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the peculiar radio structure observed in the direction of the central parts of the galaxy cluster abell585 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the galaxy cluster abell585 is briefly introduced in  2 .",
    "multi - frequency data for the system are analyzed in  3 , and discussed further in  4 .",
    "the interpretation of the obtained observational results is presented in  5 , and the summary of the studies is given in  6 .",
    "in the paper we assume modern cosmology with @xmath7kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "all source positions are given in the j2000.0 coordinate system .",
    "the cluster of galaxies abell585 ( another designation zwcl0727.1 + 4057 ; @xcite ) is centered at @xmath11@xmath12 and @xmath13@xmath14 ( the corresponding galactic longitude and latitude of 17788 and + 2444 , respectively ; @xcite ) . the cluster is classified as a ( b  m ) type ii system .",
    "the red magnitude of the cluster s tenth brightest member galaxy is 17.0mag , and there are in total 35 galaxies with apparent red magnitudes between mag@xmath15 and mag@xmath16 .",
    "abell585 occupies an area of 26  in diameter and its richness class is 0 @xcite . using the photometric redshifts of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey data release 6 ( sdss dr6 ; @xcite ) , @xcite identified a cluster named whlj073045.4@xmath17405038 , which overlaps with abell585 .",
    "the photometric redshift of this sdss cluster is @xmath18 , and the spectroscopic redshift of the brightest cluster galaxy ( @xmath19mag ) is @xmath20 .",
    "the total @xmath21-band cluster luminosity summed over all 27 member galaxies , which are spread over @xmath22mpc , is @xmath23 .    in the catalogue of superclusters ( scl ; @xcite ) , abell585 together with abell580 and abell591 appear as a part of the scl074 , for which the central position is , approximately , [ @xmath11@xmath24 , @xmath13@xmath25 .",
    "abell580 is centered at [ @xmath11@xmath26 , @xmath13@xmath27 at the redshift of @xmath28 , with the diameter @xmath29 , ( b  m ) type ii ",
    "iii , and richness class 1 .",

    "the scl074 triplet may therefore represent a rather dynamic merging structure .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is based on the archival optical , x - ray , and multi - frequency radio data , as described in detail below .",
    "a digital sky survey ( dss ) image of the central part of the galaxy cluster abell585 is shown in figure[fig : sdss ] , where the cluster member galaxies , as well as the background quasar b30727 + 409 ( see table1 ) , are marked with the cross symbols .",
    "we use the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) database to locate galaxies and to establish their associations with the abell585 cluster based on spectroscopic redshifts from the sdss dr9 @xcite .",
    "we defined all the member galaxies to have velocities in the range between @xmath34 and @xmath35 km / s ( i.e. about @xmath362000 km / s around the velocity corresponding to z=0.12 ) .",
    "the redshifts of the member galaxies are provided in table1 along with the source positions , @xmath21-band magnitudes , and central black hole masses estimated by us from the stellar velocity dispersion using the @xcite relation except for the black hole mass for b30727 + 409 , estimated using the quasar emission lines ( see  5.1 ) . in total",
    ", we found 21 galaxies within the 15 radius ( corresponding to a projected linear size of about 4mpc ) around the central cluster region , plus a luminous face - on spiral with bright optical core lacking any spectroscopic redshift determination , but with the sdss photometric redshift of @xmath37 and an optical apparent magnitude similar to the cluster member galaxies .

    "hence , for the purpose of our investigation , apart from the publicly available survey fits maps ( i.e. vlss , wenss , first , nvss and gb2 ) , we analyze available raw unpublished data from the vla archive ( these data are marked with number ` 7 ' in col .",

    "the resulting flux densities ( along with the errors ) of the quasar and of the total structure ( i.e. , quasar @xmath17 extended radio tail ) are listed in table2 .",
    "the quasar flux densities are peak and integrated values , in order to clarify any possible contamination from the diffuse emission .",
    "the flux density errors of the quasar are calculated by adding the flux measurement errors and the jmfit errors in quadrature .",
    "the multi - frequency radio data collected here can be divided into three categories : i ) those which resolve the quasar core as an isolated source and give proper values of its flux - density ( see table2 , col .",
    "7 and 8) , ii ) those which give a proper overall image and flux - densities of the entire ` quasar + extended halo ' structure but have little ability to distinguish individual components as distinct sources ( see table2 , col .",
    "9 ) , and iii ) those which have adequate angular resolution to separate and image properly both the quasar core and the extended features but may underestimate the flux densities of the extended components ( vla - b 1400mhz and vla - c 1425mhz observations ) . the former class of data ( i ) were used to determine the radio spectrum of the quasar and to examine whether the source is variable or not ( for detail see  4.1 ) .",
    "the characterized shape of the quasar continuum allowed us next to subtract the contribution of the quasar core from the total ` quasar + extended halo ' fluxes evaluated using the second ( ii ) class of data . in this way we obtained the total spectrum of the extended structure .",
    "the latter class of data ( iii ) allowed us finally to depict morphological details of the extended structure .",
    "furthermore , the vlba data were used to investigate the small - scale structure of the quasar core ( for details see  5.1 ) .",
    "figure[fig : perley ] presents our vla image at 1425mhz of the entire radio source in abell585 ( the largest angular extent of about 25 ) with an angular resolution of @xmath315 along with the @xmath35   angular resolution 1400mhz first map .",
    "the diffuse feature seen in the nvss map is now clearly resolved into two cometary - like structures with bright compact ` heads ' in their northern parts ( hereafter the eastern one ` e ' and the western one ` w ' ) , and edge  dimmed tails elongated to the south .",
    "the high - frequency ( e.g. , 8439.9mhz ) maps allow us to measure precisely the positions of the heads flux maxima as [ @xmath11@xmath40 , @xmath13@xmath41 and [ @xmath11@xmath42 , @xmath13@xmath43 .",
    "there are no optical counterparts at these positions in the dss and sdss maps .    in order to measure the total flux density of the extended emission component ( the two cometary - like structures ) ,",
    "we first measure the flux densities of the quasar core at different frequencies , and fit the spectrum with a single power - law function , which returns @xmath44 = - ( 0.077 \\pm0.039 ) \\times \\log [ \\nu/{\\rm mhz } ] + ( 2.829 \\pm 0.137)$ ] .",
    "next we subtract the fitted quasar spectrum at a given frequency from the integrated flux of the entire structure , obtaining in this way the spectrum of the extended structure only , @xmath44 = - ( 0.408 \\pm0.043 ) \\times \\log [ \\nu/{\\rm mhz } ] +   ( 3.520 \\pm 0.125)$ ] .",
    "this estimate implies a total flux density of the extended structure at 1425mhz of about 171mjy , which is consistent with the total flux density measured in the vla c  array map at 1425mhz for the western and eastern structures separately ( see figure[fig : perley ] , thick contours ) , i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath46mjy , respectively .",
    "a small disagreement here may be due to the fact that , as indicated by the multi - epoch radio data , the b30727 + 409 core radio emission is variable , decreasing with time over the last decades , and this trend is particularly clear at 1.4 , 5 and 8ghz .",
    "a spectral curvature for the extended component ( see the next section ) may also play a role .",
    "+      the nvss and wenss images  which have similar beam sizes and are sensitive to extended ( up to a few arcmin ) diffuse structures  were used to create a spectral index map of abell585 .",
    "first , using the aips task sad we subtracted the quasar b30727 + 409 from both maps .",
    "subsequently , the higher resolution map was convolved to the resolution of the 327mhz map . since misalignment of the total - power map at two frequencies",
    "could produce systematic errors in the spectral - index map , we co - registered the positions of several bright point - like field sources which surround the target source on both maps .",
    "further , both maps were brought to a common scale using the aips task hgeom .",
    "finally , the spectral index map was obtained using the aips task comb .",
    "regions with flux density values below @xmath47rms were considered to be unreliable and blanked .",
    "the final grey - scale map of the spectral index is shown in figure[fig : pol](a ) .",
    "the map indicates that there is a monotonic steepening of the radio spectrum of the diffuse component from north to south , i.e. from compact ` heads ' of the two resolved structures along their tails .",
    "the trend is not that clear in the case of the eastern tail because of an imperfect subtraction of a point source present around the tail s southern edge .",
    "such a steepening is a classic spectral signature of an aging synchrotron - emitting plasma in the lobes and plums of radio galaxies , observed in almost all luminous classical doubles ( for which the flattest radio spectra are seen at the positions of terminal hotspots , where the injection of fresh particles takes place ; e.g. , @xcite ) and also low - power radio galaxies including tailed sources in galaxy clusters ( for which which the flattest radio spectra are seen around the jet base ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the radio spectrum of the quasar core is inverted , as expected , with the 327 - 1400mhz spectral index of about @xmath48 ( defined here as @xmath49 for the flux spectral density @xmath50 ) .",
    "the mean spectral index over the extended structure is characteristic for lobes and plumes of radio galaxies in general , @xmath51 , and implies a relatively young population of the radio - emitting electrons ( @xmath52myr ) .",
    "we note in this context that rather steep radio spectra seen at the south - western outskirts of the structure ( @xmath53 ) may be due to a missing flux in the 1400mhz interferometric map only .",
    "finally , using the vla 4710.1 and 8439.9mhz maps we evaluate the spectral index of the eastern ` head ' as @xmath54 .",
    "maps of the linearly polarized intensity and fractional polarization were made by combining the nvss stokes @xmath55 and @xmath56 maps with the aips task comb .",
    "this allows for the determination of the polarized flux density , the fractional polarization , and the @xmath57-vectors polarization angle .",
    "the total intensity nvss map with the electric field @xmath57-vectors superimposed is shown in figure[fig : pol](b ) , while figure[fig : pol](c ) presents the linearly polarized intensity map with the vectors of fractional linear polarization superimposed . from these maps",
    "it can be seen that the extended structure is mildly polarized .",
    "the total integrated polarized flux intensity of the extended source is @xmath58mjy , which gives about 5% for the mean fractional polarization .",
    "the integrated polarized flux density of the compact quasar core is @xmath59mjy , and the corresponding degree of linear polarization is therefore about 1% .",
    "we found different orientations of the electric vectors in different regions of the structure , as well as changes in the levels of polarization across the source .",
    "the polarization percentage increasing along the tails ( i.e. , away from spots w and e to the south ) , resembles typical polarization properties of tailed radio galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization @xmath57-vectors , however , are mostly perpendicular to the tails .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic field vectors , in the case of negligible rotation measure ( rm ) values , would be transverse to the resolved structures , unlike in other tailed radio galaxies .",
    "such an ` unusual ' property may on the other hand simply suggest a substantial rotation of the polarization plane inside the cluster abell585 . in order to determine the real distribution of the magnetic @xmath60-field directions ,",
    "it is necessary to correct the radio data for the faraday rotation , and for that purpose follow - up radio polarization measurements at other wavelengths with high angular resolution would be needed .",

    "@xcite claimed a comparable value of @xmath63radm@xmath62 for the polarized radio feature located north - west to the quasar ; this feature coincides with the diffuse tail extending from our spot / head e. the provided value has to be taken with caution , however , since it was estimated using only two nearby frequencies of 1365mhz and 1435mhz .    ) . in several places of the figure",

    "b30727 + 409 is a luminous radio source with the 1400mhz power of @xmath64whz@xmath8 .",
    "its sdss spectrum reduced through the standard procedure ( see @xcite ) allows us to estimate the mass of the central black hole @xmath65 when using the mgii line , and @xmath66 when using the civ line .",
    "the resulting value is characteristic for radio - loud quasars at high redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also the bolometric luminosity of the accreting matter in b30727 + 409 estimated from the mgii line is typical for quasars in general , namely @xmath67ergs@xmath8 , implying high accretion rate @xmath68 ( in the eddington units ) for the standard @xmath69 radiative efficiency of the accretion disk .",
    "as mentioned previously , b30727 + 409 is a vla phase calibrator , but it was also a vlba phase calibrator .",
    "the existing vlba maps show one - sided nuclear jet oriented toward the extended structure under investigation .",
    "interestingly , the position angles of the nuclear jet and of the extended structure are similar : the former one is 127 , 125 , 123  at , respectively , 2268.3 , 4995.5 and 8338.3mhz , while the position angle of the extended structure as measured in the first map between the quasar core and the peak of the radio emission in the western ` head ' [ @xmath11@xmath70 , @xmath13@xmath71 is 134 .",
    "this agreement may suggest that the extended radio structure observed around the central region of abell585 is not related to the cluster , but instead represents the large - scale jet / lobe of the background quasar b30727 + 409 , as in fact proposed in @xcite .",
    "additionally in such a case , the x - ray emission seen in the rosat data likely extend along the radio structure , and could possibly be accounted for by the jet emission as well since large - scale quasar jets are established luminous x - ray emitters ( see @xcite for a review ) .    the angular distance between the quasar core and the western radio ` head ' is 272 , which , if the radio structure is at the quasar redshift indeed , corresponds to the linear size of 1.3mpc .",
    "the de - projected physical size of the large - scale radio structure of b30727 + 409 would be in such a case @xmath72mpc , for the anticipated quasar viewing angle @xmath73and the assumed source intrinsic symmetry .",
    "in general , lobes with linear sizes exceeding mpc , called ` giant radio sources ' , are known to be associated with radio galaxies and quasars even at high redshifts ( see @xcite ) ; the largest object of this kind known to date is characterized by the projected size of about 4.7 mpc ( j1420@xmath740545 ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , morphological , spectral , and polarization properties of giant radio sources are very different from those of the extended radio structure revealed by the high - resolution radio maps discussed in this paper .",
    "moreover , in the framework of the quasar scenario , the source energetics would be rather extreme , as discussed below .",
    "the 1400mhz flux of the extended structure @xmath75mjy ( see  4.1 ) , if produced at the redshift of @xmath2 , gives the monochromatic radio luminosity @xmath76ergs@xmath8 .",
    "since only a moderate beaming for quasar radio jets is expected on large scales , with the corresponding jet bulk lorentz factors @xmath77 @xcite , the total emitted radio power of the source would therefore read as @xmath78ergs@xmath8 for the bolometric correction factor @xmath79 ( following from the assumption that the jet radio continuum extends from @xmath80ghz down to mhz frequencies with the average spectral index of @xmath81 ) .",
    "this emitted radio power would then require the total jet kinetic power @xmath82 in excess of @xmath83ergs@xmath8 ( assuming the standard @xmath84 jet radiative efficiency ) , which is close to the maximum rate of the smbh energy extraction in the system , @xmath85ergs@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this power would have to be continuously supplied by the matter accretion for at least @xmath86myr , in order to power the @xmath87mpc - scale flat - spectrum radio cavity , and this is assuming a rather high jet advance velocity of @xmath88 ( see the related discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the aforementioned x - ray emission is in this context even more problematic , since the observed x - ray flux @xmath89ergcm@xmath62s@xmath8 , if due to the quasar jet , implies a very high luminosity @xmath91ergs@xmath8 .",
    "note that any significant beaming which could be invoked to reduce the total emitted power of a jet , would require at the same time very small jet viewing angle , and hence the de - projected linear size of the structure exceeding 10mpc .",
    "for all these reasons , we consider the quasar scenario for the analyzed extended radio structure implausible .      at the redshift of the galaxy cluster abell585",
    ", the observed 1400mhz flux of the extended radio structure corresponds to the radio luminosity of @xmath92ergs@xmath8 , which is in the range of radio luminosities for typical cluster radio halos @xcite .",
    "however , cometary - like morphologies of two distinct features with clearly defined ` hotspots ' or ` heads ' revealed on the high - resolution radio maps , their relatively small sizes @xmath93kpc ( if at @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 radio polarization , and relatively flat radio spectra ( @xmath81 ) , are all in a disagreement with such an association .    as we mentioned in  2 , abell585 is a member of the scl074 supercluster which may represent a dynamic merging structure .",
    "the energy dissipated in large - scale shocks during cluster - cluster interactions can be channeled into relativistic electrons and magnetic field ( e.g. @xcite ) , resulting in a formation of extended radio structures similar to those seen in e.g. abell85 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see  6 below ) . yet",
    "the analyzed radio features can be hardly identified with any sort of radio relics , since those elongated or even filamentary radio structures with sizes @xmath96mpc are found mostly at the outskirts of galaxy clusters , and , even though polarized , are characterized by very steep radio spectra ( @xmath97 ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "radio - loud agn typically found in clusters of galaxies are low - power radio galaxies , whose jets and lobes are often distorted and bent , with the characteristic u- or c - shape large - scale morphologies .",
    "such sources are denoted as narrow - angle tail ( nat ) and wide - angle tail ( wat ) radio galaxies , respectively .",
    "the dramatic bending of the jets is due to a combination of a parent galaxy motion within the cluster , and local pressure gradients in the icm . for the early comprehensive and statistical study of nat sources",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two radio features resolved in our high - resolution radio maps , and especially the western one , do resemble nat sources taking into account their morphologies , location around the central parts of a dynamical cluster , radio powers ( @xmath98ergs@xmath8 each ) , and finally linear sizes of the order of hundreds of kpc .",
    "the main problem with this interpretation is the lack of any obvious galaxies which could be identified as hosts of the two radio structures : as already mentioned above , no optical counterparts can be found in the sdss data at the positions of the two radio ` heads ' , which presumably would mark the positions of any putative radio cores . moreover , none of the galaxies located within the central parts of the cluster abell585 in close proximity to the radio features reveal any signatures of the agn activity ( see table1 ) .",
    "we have verified this finding by a careful examination of the all - sky mid - infrared ( mir ) data provided by the nasa wide - field infrared survey explorer satellite ( wise ; @xcite )  gaussian ; nominal 5@xmath99 point source sensitivity from @xmath30.08 up to 6mjy ; see also ` http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky ` ] in the range @xmath100@xmath101 m .",
    "indeed , all the mir emitters found in the region of interest correspond to the optically - detected galaxies and the quasar b30727 + 409 , and therefore we can exclude a possibility for the presence of heavily - obscured agn at the positions of the radio cores of the two analyzed radio features .    but",
    "can the two resolved radio features be associated with background radio galaxies located at redshifts high enough that their hosts are simply below the flux limit of the sdss ? using the @xmath21-band hubble diagram for 3c galaxies given in @xcite , and the detection limit in the @xmath21-band sdss images of @xmath102 @xcite , we estimate the minimum redshift of putative parent galaxies in this scenario as @xmath103 . at such high redshifts ,",
    "the angular size of the radio tails ( @xmath104 ) would correspond to the linear size of @xmath105mpc .",
    "keeping in mind that the largest head - tail radio galaxy known to date , peculiar 3c129 at @xmath106 , is only twice as long @xcite , we consider the possibility of two neighboring distant giant tailed radio sources to be very low .",
    "the two cluster member galaxies closest to the cores of the analyzed radio structures with projected separations of about @xmath107kpc are the giant but otherwise standard elliptical with no prominent emission lines , and the bright face - on spiral with bright optical core ( lacking however any spectroscopic redshift determination ) , designated respectively as ` p ' and ` s ' in figure[fig : perley ] ( see also table1 ) .",
    "let us therefore consider a scenario in which the radio structures in question are due to the jet activity of smbhs which experienced gravitational wave recoil kicks in galaxy merging process within the central parts of abell585 .",
    "the gravitational recoil of merging black holes is widely considered in the literature , typically in the context of the cosmological evolution of smbhs and the galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "candidate agn related to this process have been identified based on peculiarities in their line emission @xcite , or the presence of double nuclei separated by projected distances of a few up to several kpc @xcite .    if the gravitational recoil process is of any relevance for the systems analyzed in this paper , the recoil kicks have to be strong enough for a smbh to be able to escape the gravitational potential of a massive host galaxy ( see in this context @xcite ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations indicate that such large recoil velocities exceeding 1000kms@xmath8 are possible under specific conditions of rapidly spinning black holes with comparable masses and a particular orientation of their spin vectors at small angles to the orbital plane ( e.g. , @xcite ) . and in fact dry mergers of massive ellipticals in central parts of galaxy clusters may provide the required conditions , since such systems are poor in cold gaseous content ( while this is the abundant cold gas which is believed to enable an efficient alignment of black hole spins perpendicular to the orbital plane during the merger ; see @xcite ) , but on the other hand to contain rapidly spinning smbhs on average ( see in this context , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one could speculate further that the recoiled smbhs traveling through the icm after leaving host galaxies accrete only the hot intracluster gas at low ( bondi ) rates , and as such form radiatively inefficient accretion disks ; this could potentially explain the apparent lack of any agn activity at mir - optical wavelengths at the position of the cores of the analyzed radio structures .",
    "yet , on the other hand , the probability of having two major mergers in the central parts of a single cluster , within the period overlapping with radiative lifetimes of the two radio galaxies ( @xmath52myr ; see  4.2 ) , is very low .",
    "there are also no obvious ` remnant ' pairs of elliptical hosts which should be expected around the positions of the e and w spots in the framework of the gravitational recoil scenario : as emphasized above , only one giant elliptical and one bright spiral are detected within the radius of @xmath108kpc from the radio cores .",
    "note in this context that powering the lobes with the observed radio luminosities of @xmath98ergs@xmath8 requires jet kinetic luminosities of the order of , at least , @xmath109ergs@xmath8 , and therefore very high black hole masses for the anticipated low / moderate accretion rates .",
    "hence any association of the discussed radio structures with some low - mass ( and as such undetected ) hosts seems implausible . in order to justify this statement",
    ", we note that with the bondi accretion rate @xmath110 and the following maximum jet kinetic luminosity @xmath111 , one obtains the limiting black hole mass @xmath112 where @xmath113@xmath114 , @xmath115k , and @xmath116 are respectively the gas number density , temperature , and sound velocity expected for the central parts of a galaxy cluster .",
    "the peculiar arcmin - scale radio structure observed in the direction of the central parts of the galaxy cluster abell585 ( @xmath0 ) is unassociated with the distant ( @xmath2 ) radio quasar b30727 + 409 , as we demonstrated here by means of a careful analysis of all the available radio data for the system .",
    "this structure consists of two dominant features which resemble typical lobes of cluster radio galaxies of the nat type .",
    "however , we are not able to identify host galaxies of the two features in the available optical ( sdss ) and infrared ( wise ) surveys .",
    "we speculate if the analyzed systems are examples of extreme gravitational recoils of smbhs in the process of merging massive ellipticals within the central parts of a rich cluster environment , but we do not reach any robust conclusions regarding the origin of the detected radio features .",
    "large - scale radio structures lacking obvious host galaxies may not be that unique for the local clusters .",
    "for example , radio maps of b1753@xmath17580 found at the position of abell2289 @xcite show two edge - dimmed tails with bright ` heads ' and with a @xmath117 galaxy located between them @xcite , but without any detectable compact radio core .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed study of the radio structure in cluster abell4038 resembling the evolved lobes of a luminous radio galaxy , but with the most likely host elliptical galaxy displaced by about 20kpc with respect to the central parts of the radio structure .",
    "@xcite discussed three other possibly analogous systems in clusters abell13 , abell85 , and abell133 . inspecting first maps of several galaxy clusters from @xcite , we add the case of max bcg j130.34220 + 61.21246 ( @xmath118 ) to the literature examples , and",
    "note the striking similarity between the radio structures discussed in this paper and those in the @xmath119 cluster maxbcg j250.34552 + 38.03597 that lack any optical identifications .",
    "there may be more examples of such peculiar structures awaiting discovery with high - resolution multiwavelength radio observations of lesser - known clusters of galaxies in formation .",
