    "<S> _  * 100 * , 206805 ( 2008 ) ] showed that the dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) of the 1d bose gas demonstrates power - law behaviour along the limiting dispersion curve of the collective modes and calculated the corresponding exponents exactly . </S>",
    "<S> combining these recent results with a previously obtained strong - coupling expansion we present an interpolation formula for the dsf of the 1d bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained expression is further consistent with exact low energy exponents from luttinger liquid theory and shows nice agreement with recent numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> cigar - shaped traps with cold alkali atoms have recently been used to obtain a quasi-1d quantum degenerate bose gas , where atomic motion in the transverse dimensions is confined to zero - point quantum oscillations , in weak and strong interaction regimes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , we may describe the system as a one - dimensional rarefied gas where interactions of bosonic atoms can be described well by effective @xmath0-function interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the lieb - liniger model @xcite is applicable . </S>",
    "<S> being exactly solvable in the uniform case , the model , however , does not admit complete analytic solutions for the correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> up to now , this has been an outstanding problem in 1d physics  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an approximate formula for the dsf of the lieb - liniger gas that is consistent with known results in accessible limits and power laws .    </S>",
    "<S> dynamical density - density correlations , which can be measured by the two - photon bragg scattering @xcite , are described by the _ dynamic structure factor _ ( dsf ) @xcite @xmath1 here , we introduce the density fluctuations @xmath2 and the equilibrium density of particles @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case of zero temperature , where @xmath4 means ground - state average . </S>",
    "<S> the dsf is proportional to the probability of exciting the collective mode from the ground state with momentum @xmath5 and energy @xmath6 transfer , as one can see in the energy representation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : dsfdef ] ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fourier component of @xmath9 .    the lieb - liniger model @xcite represents a uniform 1d system of spinless bosons of mass @xmath10 , interacting with pairwise point interactions @xmath11 ; the interaction strength @xmath12 is assumed to be positive . </S>",
    "<S> periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of interactions can be measured in terms of the dimensionless lieb - liniger parameter @xmath13 . within the lieb - liniger model </S>",
    "<S> , the dsf has the following well - established properties .    </S>",
    "<S> \\i ) luttinger liquid theory predicts a power - law behaviour of the dsf at low energies in the vicinity of the momenta @xmath14 and yields model - independent values of the exponents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one can show @xcite that in the vicinity of  umklapp \" point ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is sound velocity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , within the luttinger - liquid theory , the dispersion is linear in vicinity of the umklapp point : @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> relation ( [ pitdsf ] ) leads to different exponents precisely at the umklapp point and outside of it : @xmath21    \\ii ) by using in a non - trivial manner the bose - fermi mapping in 1d @xcite , the authors developed the time - dependent hartree - fock scheme @xcite in the strong - coupling regime with the small parameter @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme guarantees validity of the dsf expansion @xcite </S>",

    "<S> @xmath25 are the limiting dispersions that bounds quasiparticle - quasihole excitations @xcite . in the strong - coupling regime </S>",
    "<S> they take the form @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the fermi wave vector and energy of a non - interacting fermi gas , respectively .     </S>",

    "<S> \\iii ) as was shown by imambekov and glazman @xcite , in the lieb - liniger model the dsf demonstrates power - law behaviour near the borders @xmath25 @xmath30 the positive exponents @xmath28 @xcite are related to the quasi - particle scattering phase and can be easily evaluated by solving a system of a few integral equations in thermodynamic limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the exact relation @xmath31 which obviously differs from the luttinger liquid exponent ( [ pitdsfexp ] ) for @xmath32 . however , imambekov s and glazman s result ( [ mumiumklapp ] ) is correct in the immediate vicinity of @xmath33 provided that the finite curvature of @xmath34 is taken into consideration . </S>",
    "<S> thus the difference in the exponents can be treated @xcite as an artifact of the linear spectrum approximation in the luttinger liquid theory . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the thin  strip \" in @xmath35-@xmath36 plane where the exponents are different vanishes in the point @xmath37 ; hence , the luttinger exponent @xmath38 should be exact here .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ dsfapp1 ] ) the value of the exponent @xmath49 coincides with its limiting value ( [ mumiumklapp ] ) in vicinity of the umklapp point .    now it can be easily seen from ( [ dsfapp1 ] ) that @xmath50 thus , the suggested formula is consistent with the both the luttinger liquid behaviour at the umklapp point and imambekov s and glazman s power - law behaviour in vicinity of it , as it should be .    in the strong - coupling regime , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dsfapp1 ] ) correctly yields the first order expansion ( [ dsflinear ] ) . in order to prove this , </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient to use the strong - coupling values of @xmath51 , @xmath52/\\pi+ o(1/\\gamma^2)$ ] ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and the frequency dispersions .    comparison with numerical data by caux and calabrese @xcite ( figure [ fig : dsf ] ) shows that the suggested formula nicely works in the regimes of both weak and strong coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> concluding , we propose the approximate formula ( [ dsfapp1 ] ) for dsf of the one - dimensional bose gas at zero temperature . it neglects , in effect , only the contributions of multiparticle excitations outside the bounds given by the dispersion curves @xmath33 , whose contribution is small . </S>",
    "<S> our formula is consistent with predictions of luttinger liquid theory , has the exact exponents at the edge of the spectrum , gives the correct first - order expansion in the strong - coupling regime , and shows nice agreement with available numerical data .    </S>",
