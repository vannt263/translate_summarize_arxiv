    "there has been a renewed interest in the iron - based superconductors since the discovery of superconductivity ( sc ) at about 30k in the @xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath6 ( @xmath7 = k , rb , cs or tl / k ) @xcite compounds due to their unprecedented physical properties , such as the coexistence of high temperature sc with strong antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order @xcite .",
    "however , whether sc and afm order coexist microscopically or sc only occurs in the non - magnetic phase is still highly debated since some reports support the coexistence picture @xcite and others favor the phase separation scenario @xcite .",
    "local probe techniques such as muon - spin relaxation / rotation ( @xmath8sr ) @xcite and mssbauer spectroscopy ( ms ) @xcite have shown that a two - component picture is inescapable to describe the system correctly , namely , all samples are phase - separated into a major afm phase and a minor paramagnetic ( pm ) phase .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite and @xmath8sr @xcite experiments reveal that the pm phase becomes superconducting below @xmath9 .",
    "however , the scenario that only the pm phase becomes superconducting alone can not explain all the above mentioned experiments .",
    "thus further studies on these compounds are desired to settle the debate . in this case ,",
    "an investigation on the local magnetic property is helpful in understanding the correlation between sc and magnetic ordering of these systems .",
    "ms has been proved to be a very useful tool to probe local specific information of the iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "especially , when possible coexistence of magnetic order and sc presents in the same sample , a ms study might reveal rich information .",
    "so far , only a few work using ms to study these materials @xcite have been reported . a detailed study focusing on the temperature dependence of the local magnetic field at the iron site near the superconducting transition temperature is still missing , which might hold the key to understand the interesting interplay between afm order and sc .",
    "therefore , in the present work , ms was used to study the magnetic structure and temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field ( hmf ) at the iron nucleus of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystals .",
    "the results provide evidence that a spin excitation gap opens up before entering the sc state . using a simple spin model ,",
    "we show that the ferromagnetically coupled ( fmc ) four spins can be viewed as a net spin , which couples antiferromagnetically with each other to form the checkerboard - like afm structure .",
    "single crystals of potassium intercalated iron - selenides of nominal composition k@xmath10fe@xmath2se@xmath2 were grown by the self melting method similar to previous reports @xcite .",
    "stoichiometry of high purity k pieces , fe and se powders were mixed and put in a sealed quartz tube .",
    "the samples were heated to 1273k slowly , kept for 2h , cooled down to 973k at the rate of 5k / h and then furnace cooled to room temperature by shutting down the furnace .",
    "the resulting plate - like crystals with a shiny surface are of a size up to @xmath11mm@xmath12 .",
    "the actual composition is determined to be k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 by energy dispersive x - ray spectrum ( edxs ) .",
    "single crystal x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements were performed on a philips xpert diffractometer with cu k@xmath13 radiation .",
    "ac susceptibility measurements were carried out through a commercial ( quantum design ) superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer .",
    "transmission mssbauer spectra were recorded using a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer with a @xmath14-ray source of 25mci @xmath15co in palladium matrix moving at room temperature .",
    "the absorber was kept static in a temperature - controllable cryostat filled with helium gas .",
    "the velocity of the spectrometer was calibrated with @xmath16-fe at room temperature and all the isomer shift quoted in this work are relative to that of the @xmath16-fe .",
    "single crystal x - ray diffraction pattern of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "as can be seen , only ( @xmath17 ) diffraction peaks are observed , indicating the crystallographic @xmath18-axis is perpendicular to the plane of the plate - like single crystal .",
    "interestingly , two sets of ( @xmath17 ) reflections corresponding @xmath19=14.098 and @xmath20=14.272 are observed , which are attributed to the inhomogeneous distribution of the intercalated k atoms @xcite . the temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystal measured along the @xmath21-plane with @xmath22=1oe and @xmath23=300hz is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the onset superconducting transition temperature , @xmath9 ,",
    "is determined to be 28k from the real part of the susceptibility .",

    "temperature dependence of ac susceptibility of the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 crystal measured along the @xmath21-plane with @xmath22=1oe and @xmath23=300hz .",
    "inset is the single crystal x - ray diffraction pattern of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 crystal.,width=8 ]    mssbauer spectra of a mosaic of single crystal flakes , oriented on a thin paper underlayer so that the @xmath18-axis is perpendicular to the plane of the mssbauer absorber , recorded below room temperatures are shown in fig .",

    "are fitted with two components : a dominant magnetic sextet and a nonmagnetic quadrupole doublet , with mosswinn 4.0 @xcite programe .",
    "mssbauer spectra taken at indicated temperatures of the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystal .",
    "the mssbauer absorber was prepared with well - cleaved flake - like single crystals , which were put together with the @xmath18-axis aligned perpendicular to the plane of the mssbauer absorber.,width=8 ]    make an intense study of the doublet , one finds that the two peaks are strongly polarized with an intensity ratio close to 3:1 .",
    "this means that the orientation of the main axis of the electric field gradient ( efg ) of the pm phase is parallel to the @xmath18 axis of the crystal , which agrees well with the fitted angle of @xmath25=8(3)@xmath26 by v. ksenofontov _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "due to the low statistical of the data and to simplify the fitting procedure , we fitted the doublet assuming that @xmath25=0@xmath26 . the derived isomer shift and quadrupole",
    "splitting at 15k is found to be @xmath27=0.631mm / s and @xmath28=-0.272mm / s , respectively .",
    "these hyperfine parameters are close to the reported values of @xmath29-fese @xcite , while the quadrupole splitting is a little bit smaller than the corresponding doublet in the rb@xmath10fe@xmath30se@xmath2 compound @xcite , which might be due to different stoichiometries of these samples .",
    "therefore , we may attribute the doublet to the fese phase ( pseudo - fese phase ) , which corresponds to the fese@xmath31 tetrahedrons that have k vacancy neighbors in the crystal structure .",
    "the coexistence of nonmagnetic pseudo - fese phase with the main afm phase can be naturally understood in the phase separation scenario , which is supported by scanning nanofocused x - ray diffraction @xcite , nmr @xcite , and previous mssbauer @xcite studies .    in order to get a better fit of the spectra",
    ", special care should be taken in adjusting the sextet . in our previous manuscript @xcite , we fitted the spectra with a relatively small efg value , assuming that the axis of the main component of the efg coincide with the crystallographic @xmath18-axis and the direction of the magnetic moments of the fe atoms .",
    "a close inspection of the spectra reveals that this procedure can not account for the slightly asymmetries of the line pairs ( 1,6 ) and ( 3,4 ) and the positions of the line pairs ( 2,5 ) and ( 3,4 ) as pointed out by v. ksenofontov _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we refitted the spectra according to the procedures given by v. ksenofontov _ et al _ , which solves the static hamiltonian for mixed magnetic and quadrupole interactions with arbitrary relative orientation .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath32 is assumed to be zero to further simplify the problem since the fitted value for rb@xmath10fe@xmath30se@xmath2 is rather small @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "fitting the spectra yields an averaged relative intensity of 75% for the afm phase , which is significantly smaller than the reported value of 88% for rb@xmath10fe@xmath30se@xmath2 @xcite and k@xmath10fe@xmath34se@xmath2 @xcite compounds .",
    "this may be caused by the high amounts of iron in our k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 crystal , which may favor the pseudo - fese phase .",
    "the derived hyperfine parameters for the afm phase are @xmath27=0.654mm / s and @xmath28=1.172mm / s with an angle @xmath35=44(1)@xmath26 between the axis of @xmath36 and the hmf @xmath37=28.32 t at 15k , compares well with previously reported values of some similar compounds @xcite .    in order to get a better understanding of the magnetic properties in these materials",
    ", we investigated the temperature dependence of the afm order parameter .",
    "the temperature dependence of the hmf , @xmath38 , at the fe site in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ hf ] , together with different fitting results .",
    "similar to the behavior of neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) ( 101 ) magnetic bragg peak intensity profile @xcite , the hmf shows an plateau below @xmath39 and then decreases gradually with increasing temperature .",
    "a simple brillouin function was used to fit the hmf data in a previous work @xcite and a rough agreement was found in the temperature range 10 - 530k . however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ hf ] , the brillouin function ( dot line ) together with the power law ( dashdotted line ) fails to describe the low temperature behavior of the hmf .",
    "as is well known , in the temperature range of @xmath40 , the decrease in hmf with increasing temperature can be well explained by spin excitations @xcite within the spin wave theory . for a three dimensional antiferromagnet ,",
    "the temperature dependence of hmf at low temperatures follows @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant that contains the spin wave stiffness .",
    "@xmath43 is the spin excitation gap ( seg ) , which is necessary to reproduce the plateau of the hmf at low temperatures .",
    "applying equation ( [ mseg ] ) to the data yields the following results , @xmath44=28.47 t , @xmath43=63k ( @xmath245.5mev ) .",
    "interestingly , the fitted @xmath455.5mev has a nonzero value , suggesting that a substantial seg due to spin anisotropy opens up above the the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "actually , the seg has been predicted theoretically @xcite and was recently observed by neutron scattering studies in rb@xmath46fe@xmath47se@xmath2 @xcite compound .",
    "seg was also observed in yba@xmath2cu@xmath48o@xmath49 ( ybco ) and la@xmath50sr@xmath51cuo@xmath31 ( lsco ) @xcite cuprate superconductors and whether the seg is related to superconductivity is still an open question .",
    "there is experimental evidence that well - defined seg ( @xmath246mev ) in the incommensurate spin fluctuations is observed in the superconducting state only for samples close to the optimal doping @xcite for lsco systems . and",
    "a rough proportionality between t@xmath52 and seg was also observed for ybco superconductors : in the weakly doped region , @xmath53 , while in the heavily doped region ,",
    "@xmath54 @xcite . thus",
    ", seg and sc might closely related with each other and a thorough investigation of the evolution of seg and @xmath55 with different carrier - doping levels is highly desired . in this aspect , in - depth",
    "neutron scattering studies of the afm spin excitation spectrum may yield fruitful information on this issue .",
    "temperature dependence of the hyperfine field , @xmath56 , extracted from least - squares fits of the mssbauer spectra . fitting to the @xmath56 data with different theories are also compared , the power law ( dashdotted line ) , brillouin function ( dot line ) and gaped spin wave theory ( solid line ) . as can be seen",
    ", the 3d spin wave theory with an energy gap of @xmath575.5mev can better reproduce the low - temperature plateau of the hyperfine field ( see text).,width=8 ]    to understand the temperature dependence of the hmf and estimate the magnetic exchange interactions of our sample , we go to the novel magnetic ordering structure of this compound below @xmath58 .",
    "the magnetic moments of the four irons in each @xmath59 unit cell align ferromagnetically along the crystalline @xmath18-axis @xcite . and",
    "the ferromagnetic blocks interact with each other antiferromagnetically to form a block - checkerboard afm pattern . though accredited values of exchange interactions in this system are not reached ,",
    "strong interactions within the fmc blocks have been predicted theoretically and observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "a recent neutron scattering experiment showed that the acoustic spin waves between @xmath249mev to @xmath2470mev arise mostly from afm interactions between the fmc blocks , while the optical spin waves associated with the exchange interactions of iron spins within the fm blocks are above @xmath2480mev @xcite .    considering the energy scales of the acoustic and optical spin waves and the large energy separation between them , it is reasonable to assume that , at low temperatures , the decrease in hmf with increasing temperature below room temperature is controlled by the afm interactions of the fmc blocks .",
    "thus , by fitting the temperature dependence of the hmf data we can deduce the effective interaction , @xmath60 , between two nearest fmc blocks , as illustrated in fig . [ heisenberg ] ( a ) . to simplify the calculation , we make a premise that the iron spins in the fmc block fluctuate coherently .",
    "this is reasonable at least at temperatures below room temperature due to the strong ferromagnetic interactions within the fmc block . in this case",
    ", an fmc block can be regarded as a super - spin with @xmath61 .",
    "( a ) schematic representation of the effective interaction model used in the text .",
    "@xmath62 represents the effective interaction constant within each fmc block and is strong enough with respect to the inter - block interaction constant @xmath60 to force the four spins fluctuate coherently at finite temperatures .",
    "( b ) temperature dependence of the hmf together with fitting results using equation ( [ bhft ] ) ( see text).,width=8 ]    in the simplest case of two interacting spins , the energy levels are @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the angular momenta of the two coupled spins .",
    "the hmf probed by mssbauer measurements will be @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the expectation value of the @xmath69 component of @xmath70 , and reaches its maximum value at ground state ( zero temperature ) . while at elevated temperatures , states with higher @xmath71 are accessible , which results in the decrease of hmf as observed above .",
    "if we assume the relaxation between the electronic states is fast with respect to the larmor precession time , we can express the finite temperature hmf as @xmath72 , and @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the populations and @xmath75 is the decrease in hmf corresponding to state @xmath76 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath75 is proportional to @xmath77 with the same proportionate constant for all @xmath71 states , @xmath78 , then we can fit the experimental data with equation ( [ bhft ] ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ heisenberg ] ( b ) , a good agreement between the theoretical curve and the experimental data can be obtained and the fitted parameters are @xmath60=22.8mev , @xmath44=28.44 t and @xmath79=0.697 t .    to see the efficiency of our simple model in describing the low - energy spin excitations , we compare our results with that deduced from the effective spin hamiltonian model , which has been widely used to describe the ground state and spin excitations for this type of compounds .",
    "usually , the hamiltonian involves intra - block nearest and second nearest neighbor interactions @xmath80 , @xmath81 and the inter - block nearest and second nearest neighbor interactions @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "even the third nearest neighbor interactions @xmath84 , @xmath85 have been adopted to fit the spin wave spectra by miaoyin wang _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in terms of the @xmath80-@xmath82-@xmath81-@xmath83-@xmath84-@xmath85 model , the low - energy spin waves can be approximately described by ( @xmath8617mev . obviously , our results of @xmath60 agrees reasonably well with the neutrons scattering results , which proves the validity of our above assumption .",
    "high quality single crystals of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 have been prepared and studied by mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field is well explained within the gaped spin wave theory .",
    "fitting the experimental data yields a spin excitation gap of about 5.5mev/63k . supposing the blocked spins fluctuate coherently , the effective exchange interaction between these coupled spin blocks is estimated to be @xmath60=22.8mev , which agrees reasonably well with previous npd estimated value ( @xmath8717mev ) .",
