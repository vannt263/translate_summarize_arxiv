    "the accurate h@xmath4o / sio maser positions of these sources observed by the very large array ( vla ) provided a precise alignment between the near - infrared and radio coordinate frames ( @xcite ) , enabling the position of sgr a * to be pinpointed with an accuracy better than 0.@xmath11 on near - infrared images .",
    "detections of accelerating motions of stars near the galactic center fixed the mass of the cental object at about @xmath5 ( @xcite ) . because radio interferometers have a potential of measuring the proper motions of stars relative to sgr a * [ e.g. , sjouwerman et al .",

    ", @xcite detected 14 sio sources around the galactic center .",
    "these observations ( by a beam width of about 40@xmath1 ) proved that the sio maser source density is peaked at the galactic center . because this was a set of pointed observations toward the galactic center and two one - beam offset positions",
    ", the sio source positions were not determined with an accuracy better than the beam size . to remedy the positional uncertainties to some degree",
    ", we made new mapping observations of sio masers near the galactic center using the 45-m telescope in the year 2000 .",
    "the present mapping observations on a 30@xmath1 grid can be used to derive the source positions with an uncertainty of about 510@xmath1 , depending on the signal - to - noise ratio . also ,",
    "because the intensities of sio masers are expected to vary strongly on a time scale of one year , we monitored the intensities of sio masers toward the galactic center during 19992001 . during the three - year monitoring observations",

    "the aperture efficiency of the telescope was 0.60 at 43 ghz .",
    "the half - power beam width ( hpbw ) was about 38@xmath1 at 43 ghz .",
    "a factor of 2.9 jy k@xmath3 was used to convert the antenna temperature to flux density .",
    "an acousto - optical spectrometer array of low resolution ( aos - w ) was used .",
    "each spectrometer had 250 mhz bandwidth and 2048 channels , giving a velocity coverage of about 1700 km s@xmath3 and a spectral resolution of 1.7 km s@xmath3 ( per two binned channels ) .",
    "observations were made in a position - switching mode , and the off - position was chosen to be 10@xmath9 away from the galactic center in azimuth .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked using a strong sio maser source , oh @xmath10 .",
    "the calibration of the telescope antenna temperature was made by observing the intensities of the @xmath11sio ( thermal ) , h52@xmath12 ( recombination ) , u42.767 , and sio @xmath70 , @xmath8 ( maser ) lines toward sgr b2 md5 [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",

    "in fact , several unidentified lines were found in the spectra toward sgr b2 md5 in this frequency range : u42.767 , u43.018 , u43.026 , and u43.178 .",
    "these u - lines should appear at @xmath16378 km s@xmath3 for the @xmath70 @xmath17 transition , and @xmath18 , 668 , and @xmath19 km s@xmath3 for the @xmath70 @xmath8 transition , if the circumnuclear molecular ring ( cf .",

    "( 75mm,180mm)fig1.eps    in the 2000 may observations , we made mapping observations in an area covering approximately @xmath22 centered toward sgr a*. two different modes of mapping were used : 3-point ( triangular ) mapping with 20@xmath1 separation toward sgr a * , and 9-point ( @xmath23 square ) mappings toward @xmath24 or @xmath25 , 0@xmath1 ) on a 30@xmath1 grid .",
    "the 9-point mapping mode was utilized to obtain a reasonably high level of signals in one run of the typical mapping time of about two hours ( approximately 10-minutes integration per point ) .",
    "the mapped points are shown in the top panel of figure 1 .",
    "the large circle in figure 1 indicates the effective beam of the telescope ( hpbw @xmath26 ) .",
    "because the telescope pointing has been known to be influenced strongly by wind , we made 3-point mapping on those days with wind speed less than 5 m s@xmath3 , when the telescope pointing was excellent ( error @xmath27 accuracy ) , and 9-point mapping on relatively windy days with wind speeds of 510 m s@xmath3 ( approximately @xmath28 accuracy ) .",
    "because the grid separation is larger than hpbw in the 9-point mapping , the relative intensities of the sio maser components in the grid points were supposed to be kept constant , even though the wind velocity was slightly high . in the 2001 february observations",
    ", we could manage only a few hours of observation time , and we made observations in the 3-point mapping mode toward sgr a * ; the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra obtained was not very high .",
    "therefore , we averaged the spectra of three positions ( a half - beam width each away ) .",
    "they are shown at the bottom in figure 2 .",
    "a shallow survey of sio sources in the galactic center area was also made with the 45-m telescope using a multibeam receiver ( s40 m ) prior to the present observations ( 2000 march ",
    "this shallow observation detected 9 sources in the @xmath29 area toward the galactic center ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present observations concentrated on a smaller and much closer area to the galactic center with a longer integration time per point and using a more sensitive single - beam receiver , s40 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the aos - w spectra toward the strong continuum source , sgr a * ( @xmath30 jy at 43 ghz ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , exhibited a baseline distortion of about 0.3 k at the maximum , and ripples due to a standing wave in the telescope system .",
    "the ripples in the velocity range of @xmath31 350 km s@xmath3 were relatively weak . in order to remove these complex ripple features from the spectra",
    ", we took running means of the spectra ( average of about 100 channels , or about 80 km s@xmath3 width ) , and the averaged spectra were subtracted from the originals . with this procedure ,",
    "the baselines of the resulting spectra became quite flat . because the sio maser lines are quite narrow ( width less than 10 km s@xmath3 ) and weak ( @xmath32 k ) , this method seems to work well , except for a strong line of @xmath33 k at @xmath6 km s@xmath3 ( no . 6 in table 1 ) .",
    "an additional baseline adjustment was made by taking a parabolic fit to the trough between @xmath31 40 km s@xmath3 near this strong feature .",
    "the resulting three - year spectra toward sgr a * [ @xmath34=(0,0 ) ] are shown in figure 2 .",
    "detections were judged by criteria similar to those given in @xcite .",
    "all of the peaks for a single channel with @xmath35 and features for several channels with @xmath36 were treated as detection candidates .",
    "then , all of the features were checked as to whether or not they were detected in the spectra of both the @xmath8 and 2 transitions of sio , at nearby positions , or at different epochs of observations .",
    "dubious features were discarded .",
    "after these careful checks , we selected 15 sio spectral components as confident detections , which are listed in table 1 ; the number , telescope positions ( relative to sgr a * ) , @xmath37 , peak antenna temperatures , integrated intensities , r.m.s .",

    "late november of 2000 .",
    "however , because the observed light curve ( @xcite ) has a large ambiguity , the estimated time of the light maximum is quite uncertain .",

    "if they are scaled to a distance of 500 pc ( @xmath53 jy ) , they are comparable with the intensities of the orion sio masers . therefore , the sio maser flare of irs 10 ee may indicate that the mass - loss rate of this star is temporarily enhanced to rates comparable to those from orion irc2 and sgr b2 md5 .",
    "if the flare of irs 10 ee is repeated periodically , it is probably associated with a pulsation activity of the central star . if it is irregular , it is possible to consider another mechanism , for example , a wind ",
    "wind collision between nearby massive stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , a tidal effect due to a close encounter between nearby stars might not be negligible , because the density of stars in the central star cluster is quite high .",

    "a histogram of the periods is shown in figure 7 . because the sample involves only 8 stars , we divided it into two bins , i.e. , above and below 450 days .",
    "it is worth mentioning that all sources with oh counterparts have periods of more than 450 days ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "note that the average period of the sample with 412 large - amplitude variables near the galactic center given by @xcite is 427 days .",
    "therefore , the galactic - center sio source sample is probably weighted more toward those variables with longer periods than the average .",
    "sio masers are , however , occasionally detected in stars with shorter periods than those in which oh masers were found .",
    "considering the mass  luminosity  period relation [ e.g. , @xcite ] , we conclude that lower - mass agb stars are more often detected in sio maser observations than in oh 1612 mhz observations . because the size of the sample is slightly small , the conclusion may not be free from statistical fluctuations .",
    "however , the present conclusion is quite consistent with the finding by @xcite that the oh 1612 mhz sources have longer periods than the average period in their sample . according to an sio maser study of the galactic disk iras sources ( @xcite ) , stars with bluer colors in terms of the iras 25/12 @xmath54 m intensity ratio ( relatively thin dust envelope ) tend to be detected in sio masers more often than in oh 1612 mhz masers .",
    "this fact also seems to agree qualitatively with the above result for the galactic - center agb stars , though the iras 25/12 @xmath54 m colors do not necessarily correlate well with the periods of agb stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
