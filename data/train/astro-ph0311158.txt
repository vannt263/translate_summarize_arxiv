    "in the earliest stages of star formation  the so - called class0 and class1 phases  protostars are still deeply embedded in their parental molecular cloud cores .",
    "this material absorbs almost all of the emitted radiation of the star in the optical and the near - infrared . the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of class0 protostars peaks at about 100160@xmath2 m , the wavelength of the maximum of a modified blackbody at 3080k .",
    "hence , direct observations of protostars have to be carried out in the far - infrared and in the ( sub-)mm wavelength range .",
    "sub - mm and millimeter observations of some of the sources investigated here have been obtained e.g. by lefloch et al .",

    "@xcite , gueth et al .",
    "@xcite , motte & andr @xcite , and gueth & guilloteau @xcite .    the iso satellite ( kessler et al .",
    "@xcite ) with its phot instrument had the capacity to measure the broad - band continuum in the far - infrared .",
    "such observations , covering the peak region of the sed of protostars , help to yield some of the major properties of these objects such as their temperature , the sub - mm slope of their sed , the optical depth and the solid angle under which they emit .",
    "the latter two can not be disentangled due to the limited spatial resolution of the isophot instrument . with higher resolution observations ( e.g. scuba ) , however , we can independently determine the solid angle under which an object is seen and that way infer its optical depth .",
    "these parameters , together with the distance , enable us to calculate the total ( l@xmath0 ) and sub - mm ( l@xmath3 ) luminosities of each object .",
    "we may then decide whether an object really is of class0 or not by determining the l@xmath3/l@xmath0 ratio ( andr et al .",
    "@xcite ) . finally , by placing the inferred values on a temperature  bolometric luminosity diagram  the equivalent to a hertzsprung - russell diagram for protostars ( myers et al .",
    "@xcite )  we are able for the first time to estimate the ( model dependent ) ages and masses of these sources directly .",
    "bipolar outflows invariably accompany class0 sources : strong inflow and outflow of material are concurrent .",
    "we thus wish to probe how the mass outflow rate is related to the mass accretion rate onto the protostar .",
    "the outflowing material interacts with the ambient medium through radiative shocks .",
    "thus , the luminosity of the outflow may be correlated with some of the source properties ( e.g. the bolometric source luminosity ) , which depend on the mass accretion rate .",
    "therefore , we measured the luminosities of the outflows of 16 class0 sources in the 10s(1 ) line of molecular hydrogen .",
    "this is usually the strongest and easiest line to observe in near - infrared spectra of shocked molecular hydrogen , and due to the short cooling time of h@xmath4 it is a good tracer of the present interaction of the outflow with the surrounding material .",
    "these h@xmath4 luminosities are then compared with various source properties to investigate possible correlations .",
    "modelling of class0 protostars remains in its infancy .",
    "schemes now exist which yield evolutionary tracks , based on relating gas accretion to the dusty envelope ( myers et al.@xcite ) and jet thrust to gas accretion ( bontemps et al .",
    "@xcite , saraceno et al .",
    "@xcite , smith @xcite , and andr et al .",
    "we combine these schemes here in order to test if the simplest assumptions , such as a spherical envelope and a single accreting object , are feasible .    in this paper",
    ", we first present our far - infrared iso maps and spectroscopy , and then summarize the data analysis and how we derive temperatures and luminosities ( sect.[datareduction ] ) . in sect.[results ] , we present our results , and comment on individual objects . a discussion of age and mass determination , and the general relationship to the outflows is contained in sect.[discussion ] . a framework within which the data can be interpreted is then put forward ( sect.[evolscheme ] ) .",
    "we used the iso satellite to obtain isophot minimaps of six class0 sources and lws full grating spectra for three of them .",

    "our observations of cepe , hh211-mm , ic1396w , l1157 , l1211 , and rno15fir were carried out at their nominal iras positions . in our isophot maps ( shown in figs.[cepe_data][rno15fir_data ] ) we detected more objects than were actually targeted . in four cases other ( partly ) unexpected embedded objects or bright diffuse continuum emission",

    "discrepancies of the fluxes between psf and `` aperture '' photometry are for various reasons : first , it is a major problem to determine which pixel contributes to which object when doing `` aperture '' photometry .",
    "a second problem is the determination of the background .",
    "when using the psf fitting method , the background is determined automatically ( provided that the object is a point source and in the centre of a pixel ) , while for `` aperture '' photometry one has to choose background pixels . concerning the absolute calibration errors for the two detectors of 15 and 10% for the c100 and c200 detector , respectively , and an additional error of 20% due to background uncertainties , we find that both flux determination methods lead to consistent results in almost all cases .",
    "most of our investigated objects are of class0 type according to the l@xmath3/l@xmath0 criterion .",
    "we can not decide whether the newly discovered objects in our maps are of class0 , because they are situated at the edges of the isophot maps . due to the different sizes of the maps",
    "we certainly underestimate their fluxes at 60 and 100@xmath2 m , which alters their derived sed in the way that they seem to be proportionally brighter at the longer wavelengths , but to an unknown extent .",
    "the isophot and the iras fluxes at 60 and 100@xmath2 m are consistent within the errors only for cepe .",
    "for all other objects the iras point source catalogue gives values which are a factor of about 1.8 brighter .",
    "apart from the fact that the errors for the iras data are quite large and in some cases only upper limits are given , the main reason for the differences is that the resolution of the iras satellite was not sufficient to resolve close - by sources . only cepe and l1157 seem not to have other young objects in their immediate vicinity , and these are the two objects where the iras and isophot fluxes match the best .",
    "cepe is a known double source ( moro - martn et al .",
    "@xcite ) which can not be resolved by iras nor isophot . for these reasons and the still fairly large errors in the flux measurements , no investigation of the time evolution of the fluxes of these young sources over the 14 year time span",
    "( @xmath59 0.1% of the age of our objects ) between iras and iso is possible .",
    "the psf photometry suggests that all the objects are seen as point sources for the isophot detectors .",
    "when subtracting the fitted psf , no systematic residuals are visible in the difference images .",
    "thus , the angular size of the sources is at maximum 10 , a quarter of the fhwm of the psf .",
    "this leads to an upper limit for the source solid angles of about 100@xmath60 .",
    "this fact is supported by the inferred sizes r@xmath32 on the order of 1@xmath810@xmath61sr ( 4@xmath60 ) , which is less than one percent of the pixel size of the c100 detector .",
    "for the three objects for which we obtained a lws spectrum , we can compare the phot flux with the lws continuum . while the lws continuum is a sum of the continuum of the source and background radiation ,",
    "the phot maps give the true flux of the source .",
    "so , the difference between lws and phot should be the background radiation ( e.g. from cold dust ) .",

    "comparable observations in the same transition and isotope of co are needed for a statistically reasonable sample of objects to study their behaviour . at present , only small samples of class0 sources have been thus analysed ( e.g. bontemps et al .",

    "modelling of outflows has demonstrated that the fraction of mass which escapes through jets must reach a maximum during the class0 stage .",
    "this is required to account for the excess momentum and power of class0 bipolar outflows , as calculated from observations of emission lines of co rotational transitions ( see smith @xcite ) .",
    "we outline in the appendix the fundamental formulae of the evolutionary scheme .    according to previous modelling of the envelope ,",

    "@xcite ) . the low final mass is a result of this version of the evolutionary scheme employed , for which we maintain the same accretion timescale but alter the accretion rate to generate the tracks .",
    "this implies that the final mass is nearly proportional to the peak accretion luminosity .",
    "future statistical studies will lead to revisions of this first model .",

    "we assume that the observed emission is produced in the warm shocks where the jets dissipate their energy , l@xmath85 .",
    "the fraction of the jet power dissipated in molecular hydrogen lines is taken to be 2% .",
    "this is consistent with numerical simulations and bow shock modelling which predict , typically , 10% of the infrared radiation from shocks in dense clouds to be in the form of h@xmath4 lines .",
    "we also assume that 80% of the jet energy is hidden by just under two magnitudes of k - band extinction .",
    "the shock power has also been estimated from the far - infrared lines of co , oi , oh , and h@xmath4o , measured by iso ( giannini et al .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", we shall assume that these lines in total , within the iso - lws beam , also represent 2% of the jet power , l@xmath85 .",
    "we thus increase estimated h@xmath4 and sub - mm luminosities by 50 to yield the displayed values .",

    "the envelope mass provides a testable prediction .",
    "this mass is not strongly dependent on the evolutionary path but is necessary to provide the optical depth out to a sufficiently large radius to permit the measured low bolometric temperature .",

    "<S> we present far - infrared maps and spectroscopy for a number of deeply embedded protostellar objects ( cepe , hh211-mm , ic1396w , l1157 , l1211 , and rno15fir ) from data that we acquired with the iso instruments phot and lws . </S>",
    "<S> several previously undetected deeply embedded sources are found in the vicinity of our targets . </S>",
    "<S> we determine temperatures and luminosities of seven objects and locate them on a l@xmath0-t@xmath0 diagram  the equivalent to a hertzsprung - russell diagram for protostars . </S>",
    "<S> their masses and ages , according to their location on tracks taken from our evolutionary model , are derived . </S>",
    "<S> l1211 and cepe appear to be intermediate mass objects which will reach final masses of about 3m@xmath1 , while the other sources are in or below the solar mass range . </S>",
    "<S> the derived ages of 15000 to 30000yr are consistent with their current class0 state . a comparison of the luminosity of the associated outflows in the 10s(1 ) line of molecular hydrogen with the source properties ( bolometric luminosity , bolometric temperature , and envelope mass ) of 16 class0 sources shows no statistically significant correlations . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the data are consistent with a scheme in which the outflow strength and protostar evolve simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the relationship is partially disguised , however , by the local properties of the surrounding material , the extinction , and short - term flux variability .    </S>",
