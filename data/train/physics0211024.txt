    "it has been known for several years that two - dimensional navier - stokes ( 2d ns ) turbulence with periodic boundary conditions and at high reynolds numbers ( in excess of a very few thousand ) will relax to long - lived , quasi - steady states whose topology is preserved and whose energy decays more or less inversely proportionally to the reynolds number , computed with respect to a box dimension and an rms initial turbulent velocity .",
    "when this energy decay time is large compared to the initial eddy turnover time , the quasi - steady state can be reached at a time when the total energy decay is fractionally small , though the enstrophy decay can be fractionally large .",
    "it came as a surprise when , a decade or more ago , a series of such computations  @xcite revealed that the late - time quasi - steady state for an initially turbulent run at a reynolds number above 14,000 showed a pointwise hyperbolic sinusoidal dependence between stream function and vorticity .",
    "the prediction of such a dependence , in the context of a mean - field treatment of ideal line vortices ( or guiding - center plasma rods ) had been given thirty years ago  @xcite and has since been extended and refined in a series of investigations by several groups  @xcite : in every case referring to ideal , non - viscous systems .",
    "the system is hamiltonian with a finite phase space , and it is natural to apply boltzmann statistics to its dynamics , as originally suggested by onsager  @xcite ( see also lin  @xcite ) .",
    "the surprise came in the extent to which the ideal euler mean - field predictions fit the navier - stokes results .",
    "at least one attempt was made to define an entropy for the case of finite viscosity  @xcite but generated new puzzles of its own .    in the late 1980s and early 1990s ,",
    "an alternative formulation was given by robert , sommeria and chavanis  @xcite , by miller and colleagues  @xcite and later explored by brands , maassen and clercx @xcite .",
    "the principal difference was that the vorticity field was discretized not in terms of delta - functions , but rather in terms of finite - area , mutually - exclusive `` patches '' of vorticity , to which lynden - bell statistics  @xcite could be applied .",
    "the choice of parameters in the patch formulation is wider than that of equal - strength point vortices , in that one must decide in advance the size of the patches , and the number of `` levels , '' or strengths , that the patches carry .",
    "there seems to be no deductive mechanism for making such choices , and so we stick with the simplest , taking equal - area patches and never more than three levels , including zero .    for readers not inclined to pursue the original references for these formulations , which in some cases require considerable mathematical sophistication",
    ", we offer in appendix a a summary treatment of the derivation of the `` patch '' dependence of vorticity on stream function in the `` most probable , '' or maximum - entropy , state .",
    "it is attempted to do this using the least forbidding and most transparent mathematics available to the purpose .",
    "we show how in the limit of zero - area patches , the point dependence is recovered .",
    "thus the reader is being referred to appendix a for a derivation of the nonlinear partial differential equations to be introduced in section [ sec : s2 ] as candidates for the predictor of the most - probable state of late - time decaying 2d ns turbulence .",
    "section [ sec : s2 ] will summarize both the numerical method ( now well - known in its essentials ) , due originally to orszag and patterson  @xcite , to which various sets of initial conditions will be subjected .",
    "we will also describe the motivation for choosing these initial conditions , in terms of what we expect from them as possible most - probable states .",
    "we will concentrate on initial conditions for which it appears that the predicted outcomes using point and patch entropies will be as different as possible .",
    "we will refer the reader to appendix b for a description of how the sinh - poisson relation and its patch generalizations are dealt with numerically ( a non - trivial task ) .",
    "section [ sec : s3 ] contains the main body of the results that we have found . among other unexpected features ,",
    "we have found a series of one - dimensional ( 1d ) solutions to the most - probable state equations , whereas the literature up to now has dealt only with 2d solutions ( `` dipoles , '' `` quadrupoles , '' `` octupoles , '' etc . ) .",
    "there are cases in which the entropies of the 1d solutions ( which we call `` bars '' ) are extremely close to those of the dipole over a considerable range of energy . which is greater depends on seemingly arbitrary choices , in the patch formulation , such as the areas of the patches used .",
    "classes of initial conditions are found ( not essentially turbulent ones ) for which relaxation to the `` bar '' states is observed .",
    "it will be easier , in the context of the details of the solutions , to illustrate the variety of behavior we have been able to catalogue .",
    "section [ sec : s4 ] will be a summary of what we think we have learned , and of what remains to be learned .",
    "one of the more radical , if incidental , conclusions which we believe may be extracted from these runs ( to be discussed in more detail later ) is that in the context of the initial value problem , all 2d ns turbulence may result only from its having been there initially .",
    "otherwise , it can come into existence only through random external `` stirring . ''",
    "we should caution the reader that the word `` turbulence '' in this manuscript will be used in a somewhat looser sense than is customary .",
    "it will not always mean a state of the fluid in which the kinetic energy is widely shared by many fourier modes .",
    "we have concentrated on initial conditions which seemed to us most relevant to producing effects peculiar to the `` patch '' description : namely , initial vorticity distributions in which a few flat levels of nearly constant vorticity could be readily identified .",
    "we expected , because of instabilities in the shear flows these represent , that turbulence of a typical broad - band modal structure would soon be generated , as it is in three dimensions .",
    "we found that instabilities could indeed be activated , but often , broad - band turbulence of the conventional kind was not the result .",
    "instead , energy spectra dominated by only a few low - lying ( in fourier space ) modes were nonlinearly dynamically converted to fourier spectra dominated by only a few ( but different ) low - lying modes .",
    "we have in fact found it nearly impossible to generate genuinely broad - band 2d ns turbulence through instabilities , rather than through initial conditions or externally - imposed stirring . perhaps surprisingly , the dynamical evolution involved sometimes , but not nearly always , led to late - time quasi - steady states that seemed to correspond to most - probable `` patch '' predictions : most interestingly , the one - dimensional `` bar '' state , as will be seen .",
    "broad - band , initially - excited turbulence continued to lead to the classical dipolar late - time state , as it has in previous turbulence simulations .",
    "we address ourselves to the long - time dynamics in two dimensions ( 2d ) of the navier - stokes equation in the usual vorticity representation , @xmath0 where the fluid velocity @xmath1 is to be written in terms of the stream function @xmath2 as @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a unit vector in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "@xmath1 has only @xmath6 and @xmath7 components , which depend only upon @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and the time @xmath8 . in the natural dimensionless units of the problem",
    ", the kinematic viscosity @xmath9 may be interpreted as the reciprocal of the reynolds number , which we will specify in more detail presently .",
    "the curl of @xmath10 is the vorticity @xmath11 , which has only one component , also in the @xmath5-direction .",
    "the stream function @xmath2 and the non - vanishing component of vorticity @xmath12 are related by poisson s equation ,    @xmath13    we note that dropping the final viscous term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : navier ] ) leaves us with the 2d equations of an ideal euler fluid .",
    "we note moreover that a time - independent solution of these euler equations results any time @xmath12 is a differentiable function of @xmath2 .",
    "we will work in a periodic box with sides @xmath14 in length , and will use the unit length 1 to define the reynolds number ; thus our basic unit of length is roughly 1/6 of a box dimension .",
    "the unit of velocity will typically be a root - mean - square value of the initial velocity , and we will attempt to make this equal to 1 whenever possible .",
    "thus @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : navier ] ) may reasonably be identified with the reciprocal of an initial reynolds number , re .",
    "we are interested in values of re of at least several thousand , so that the final term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : navier ] ) is formally very small , except in regions of steep vorticity gradients .",
    "the `` eddy turnover time , '' which we shall use as a unit of @xmath8 , is thus about 1/6 of a box dimension divided by an initial rms velocity .",
    "it has been known for many years that under such circumstances , the kinetic energy @xmath15 , defined by    @xmath16    decays slowly proportionally to @xmath9 .",
    "however , the decays of higher - order euler - equation invariants constructed as integral moments of @xmath12 , such as the enstrophy ,    @xmath17    appear to continue to decay at an @xmath18 rate ; even a weak dependence of their decay rate upon @xmath9 has not been convincingly demonstrated .",
    "note that both ideal invariants are referred to unit volume , in the dimensionless units .",
    "when high reynolds numbers exist , then , the turbulent decay of energy is seen to be very slow , relative to any other identifiable ideal euler invariant . when the energy decay time is large enough to be well - separated from the eddy turnover time",
    ", it is possible to observe in numerical computations  @xcite that a quasi - steady state is reached in a time over which the fractional decay of energy is small ( a few hundred eddy turnover times ) .",
    "one might expect to find a `` selectively decayed '' state , in which the enstrophy to energy ratio is minimal  @xcite , and indeed , if one waits long enough , it can be analytically proved that such a state must be approached  @xcite .",
    "however , it was found  @xcite that long before that time , the quasi - steady , slowly - decaying state that is reached has a rather sharp one - to - one pointwise correspondence between @xmath12 and @xmath2 .",
    "the elucidation and testing of this correspondence is the principal purpose of this paper .    clearly , even though a slow viscous decay may be superimposed on such a state with @xmath12 approximately a function of @xmath2 , the state is also closely approximated by a time - independent solution of the euler equations .",
    "there is no a priori reason why this should be so .",
    "it is a fact we attempt to incorporate here into a coordinated set of direct numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : navier ] ) and a combined analytical and numerical argument , based upon statistical mechanics , in pursuit of what the connection between @xmath12 and @xmath2 should be .",
    "the reader is referred to appendix a for a summary of the statistical mechanical arguments .",
    "they depend upon a discretization of vorticity in terms of delta - function line vortices ( `` points '' ) or in terms of mutually - exclusive , finite - area `` patches . ''",
    "boltzmann statistics are applied to the former , to define an entropy , or logarithm of the probability of a state , and lynden - bell statistics are applied to the latter .",
    "the limit of zero - area , finite - vorticity patches are points .",
    "thus the patch formulation can be viewed as containing the point version of the theory , and either is or is not a useful generalization of it . in both cases ,",
    "what results is a `` most probable '' dependence of vorticity upon stream function . a mean - field limit ( infinitely - many points or patches , of arbitrarily small strength )",
    "is then taken , to yield continuous and differentiable functions @xmath12(@xmath2 ) . in appendix",
    "a , it is shown that for points , the resulting function is : @xmath19 for patches , the resulting function is : @xmath20    the symbols @xmath21 , @xmath22 are lagrange multipliers , which enter via a maximization of the appropriate entropy subject to the constraints of given energy and positive and negative fluxes of vorticity .",
    "they are determined in principle by demanding that the energies and vorticity fluxes calculated on the basis of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : stream1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : point1 ] ) or ( [ eqn : general1 ] ) match specified values . in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : general1 ] ) , the @xmath23 are the `` levels '' of vorticity corresponding to the different sized patches , and must be chosen somewhat arbitrarily .",
    "@xmath24 is a fixed size of a `` patch , '' defined in detail in appendix a , and may be chosen arbitrarily , within wide limits .",
    "( [ eqn : point1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : general1 ] ) have infinitely many solutions .",
    "the physical ones are interpreted to be those which maximize the appropriate entropy from which they were derived .",
    "the others represent local maxima , which , as we shall see , may in some cases represent attainable states in the computations .",
    "the questions before us are :    * how does one determine the entropy - maximizing time - independent solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : point1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : general1 ] ) ? * how close may we come to those solutions in a dynamical computation that solves eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : navier ] ) and ( [ eqn : stream1 ] ) as a time - dependent initial - value problem with large but finite reynolds number ? * are there noticeable differences between the predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : point1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : general1 ] ) and are there reasons for preferring one to the other as predictors of late - time turbulent decays ?    it is to be stressed that all three questions are answerable not in the abstract , but only as a result of somewhat demanding computations .",
    "there is no a priori reason why navier - stokes turbulent decays should be predicted at all by anything having to do with the euler equations .",
    "the latter will never be soluble , for continuous initial conditions , over time intervals long enough to make ideal solutions of much interest , because it is in the nature of euler codes , having no minimum physically - determined length scale , to overrun their own resolution in a very few eddy turnover times .",
    "if the predicted states had not shown some empirical relevance to navier - stokes solutions , there would be no justification for this activity .",
    "the dynamical code used here is of the now familiar orszag - patterson pseudospectral variety  @xcite .",
    "the code is a parallelized mpi fortran 90 version of an earlier fortran 77 code provided by w.h .",
    "matthaeus ( private communication ) .",
    "it is fully de - aliased , using the shifted - grid method .",
    "it has been run , in the runs reported here , on the sgi origin 3800 at sara supercomputing centre in amsterdam .",
    "some of the simulations ( resulting in the `` bar '' final state in section [ sec : s3:b:1:bb ] ) have also been recomputed with a different pseudospectral fourier code ( provided by dr .",
    "nielsen , riso national laboratories , denmark . )",
    "these computations yielded the same conclusions .",
    "all runs resolve the kolmogorov dissipation wave number based on enstrophy dissipation .",
    "previously , initial conditions for turbulent decay runs have tended to use randomly loaded fourier coefficients in the spectrum or vorticity fields up to some upper wave number .",
    "these have typically been chosen to match some cascade wavenumber @xmath25-spectrum , such as the `` @xmath26 '' direct enstrophy cascade  @xcite spectrum predicted by kraichnan  @xcite .",
    "the phases have been chosen from a random number generator .",
    "this has been done to achieve the most disordered ( in some sense ) initial field compatible with a particular power spectrum .",
    "several of the runs to be reported later are in fact of this variety .",
    "such an initialization can only yield a vorticity distribution that is analytic in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , since only sinusoidal functions are involved , even though the spatial dependence may be wildly fluctuating .",
    "such a vorticity distribution can take on any particular value of @xmath12 only over a set of measure zero .",
    "for this reason , one might imagine it would tend to de - emphasize features that corresponded to the `` levels '' in the patch formulation , over which the vorticity is supposed to take on a constant value inside a compact area . therefore , we have also stressed initial conditions that have large , flat areas of vorticity , separated by thin regions , with as steep spatial gradients between them as the code will resolve .",
    "our original intention was that these would correspond to unstable laminar shear flows whose instabilities would subsequently generate turbulence . somewhat to our surprise",
    ", we have found it easy to produce shear - flow instabilities but not ones that led to turbulence , in the sense of broad @xmath25-spectra .",
    "we have come to suspect that this is a feature inherent to two - dimensional flows , and perusal of the literature has uncovered only three - dimensional turbulence as a consequence of unstable shear flows , but not two - dimensional ; but this must be left as a conjecture rather than a demonstrated fact .    in any case , in order to induce a large number of fourier modes to participate in the subsequent dynamics , we have found it necessary , in the runs evolving from vorticity distributions with flat areas , to add significant amounts of random noise initially , in order to get a subsequent @xmath25-spectrum that could readily be called `` turbulent . ''",
    "even then , some of the evolution we find might have its status as turbulence disputed .",
    "so referring to appendix a for the derivations of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : point1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : general1 ] ) , and to appendix b for the method of their numerical solution , we proceed in sec . 3 to a description of initial conditions used in the dynamical runs , the states to which they evolved , and their comparisons with the maximum - entropy or `` most probable '' states that eqs . ( [ eqn : point1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : general1 ] ) imply .",
    "we first summarize the results of the solutions of the most - probable - state equations , derived in appendix a ; the method of their solution is described in appendix b. the goal is not only to find numerical solutions but to determine which among the solutions has the highest entropy for given energy and vorticity fluxes . generally speaking ,",
    "the entropies of states with more maxima and minima have been seen to be less than those with fewer , and we can be guided by this .",
    "but there are instances where solutions of two different topologies can be found whose entropies lie very close to each other , as found by pointin and lundgren  @xcite , and we must concentrate on those .",
    "we consider the point relation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : point1 ] ) in the absence of any conditions that would suggest asymmetry between positives and negatives , so that the two lagrange multipliers @xmath27 .",

    "( [ eqn : s_point ] ) makes it most susceptible to numerical solution .",
    "once it is solved , for a given value of @xmath39 , we must keep in mind that in order to evaluate the entropy associated with the solution , we must revert to the parameters of eq .",

    "it is useful to introduce terms for the solutions of differing topology .",
