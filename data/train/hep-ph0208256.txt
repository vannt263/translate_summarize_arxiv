    "recently , the decay @xmath1 has been the subject of a number of investigations @xcite , where it has been pointed out that this process may serve as an important probe of the standard model ( sm ) and possible extensions .",

    "as for the radiative dilepton decay @xmath1 , one expects the same to be true .",
    "however , a surprisingly strong dependence of the fb asymmetry on the specific form factor model can be found in the existing literature @xcite , which needs better understanding .    in this paper , we analyse the form factors for the @xmath2 transition induced by vector , axial - vector , tensor , and pseudotensor currents .",
    "we show that important relations between form factors of different currents arise as a consequence of the gauge invariance of the @xmath2 amplitude .",

    "combined with the relations among the form factors from leet , the results obtained provide strong restrictions on the @xmath2 form factors .",
    "we propose a simple model for the form factors which is valid over the full range of the photon energy , and which satisfies all known constraints .",
    "an important remark is in order here : it has been shown recently that a proper account of collinear and soft gluons leads to a different effective theory ",

    "<S> we analyse the form factors for the @xmath0 weak transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that making use of the gauge invariance of the @xmath1 amplitude , the structure of the form factors in the resonance region , and their relations at large values of the photon energy results in efficient constraints on the behavior of the form factors . based on these constraints , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple parametrization of the form factors and apply it to the lepton forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry in the @xmath1 decay . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the behavior of the fb asymmetry as a function of the photon energy , as well as the location of its zero , depend only weakly on the @xmath2 form factors , and thus constitutes a powerful tool for testing the standard model . </S>"
