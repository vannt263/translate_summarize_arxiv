    "the reconstruction of photon statistics of quantum optical fields is of the utmost relevance for several applications , ranging from quantum information @xcite to the foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite and quantum optics @xcite . despite this fact , the realization of photodetectors well suited for this purpose still represents an experimental challenge . the few existing examples @xcite show severe limitations . on the other hand ,",
    "reconstruction schemes based on quantum tomography @xcite require phase - matching with a suitable local oscillator and do not represent a technique suited for a diffuse use .",
    "this situation prompted various theoretical studies @xcite addressed to achieve the reconstruction of the ( diagonal ) elements of the density matrix exploiting the information achievable with realistic detectors .",
    "in a recent series of papers @xcite , we have demonstrated how a very satisfactory reconstruction of the statistics of mono - partite and bi - partite quantum optical states may be obtained using the simplest kind of detectors , namely on / off detectors @xcite operating in the geiger mode , whose outcomes are either `` off '' ( no photons detected ) or `` on '' , i.e. , a `` click '' , indicating the detection of one or more photons .",
    "our method recovers the full photon statistics using maximum likelihood ( maxlik ) reconstruction on on / off data obtained using variable detection efficiency ( by inserting calibrated neutral filters ) .",
    "in this paper we present a modified version of our method , which improves both convergence and accuracy upon incorporating the obvious _ a priori _ constraint of finite signal energy .",
    "in particular , we address the reconstruction of the full photon distribution of multimode fields generated by seeded parametric down - conversion .",
    "the novel method allows to overcome the increased complexity of the reconstruction problem and represents an important step in view of a widespread application of maxlik reconstruction .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we describe the constrained maxlik algorithm in some details , whereas in section [ s : test ] we describe the experimental apparatus and illustrate the application of the method to the reconstruction of the photon distribution of multimode fields generated by seeded parametric down - conversion . finally , section [ s : remarks ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the probability @xmath0 that a photodetector with quantum efficiency @xmath1 does not click , when an input quantum state @xmath2 impinges on it , reads as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath5-th entry of the photon distribution of the input state .",
    "now , if we consider a set of @xmath6 detectors with different quantum efficiencies @xmath7 , @xmath8 , then we can write the `` off '' probabilities as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 . looking at eq .",
    "( [ off : prob ] ) as a statistical model for the parameters @xmath11 , we can solve it by the maxlik estimation .",
    "we proceed as follows : first of all , we assume there exists a value @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is negligible for @xmath14 ; we assign the _ loglikelihood _ function ( with normalized @xmath15 ) , that is the global probability of the sample : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the experimental frequency of `` off '' events , @xmath18 being the number of `` off '' events for a fixed quantum efficiency @xmath7 and @xmath19 the total events amount .",
    "the maxlik estimated @xmath13 values are the ones maximizing @xmath20 .",
    "since the model is linear and the unknowns @xmath13 are positive , we can find the expectation - maximization solution of the maxlik problem by means of an iterative procedure as described in @xcite , i.e. : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the value of @xmath13 evaluated at the @xmath23-th iteration , and @xmath24 . the algorithm ( [ em : sol : st ] ) , known to converge unbiasedly to the maxlik solution , provides a solution once the initial distribution @xmath25 is chosen . on the other hand",
    ", the initial distribution slightly affects only the convergence rate and _ not _ the precision at convergence @xcite .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the solution obtained above corresponds to the best photon distribution fitting the experimental data , i.e. , the measured `` off '' probabilities .",
    "however , it is possible that different photon distributions fit the same experimental data , giving rise to a _",
    "family _ of _ suitable _ distributions .",
    "in these cases it could happen that the maxlik solution , even if in good agreement with the available experimental knowledge , may be different from the actual ( unknown ) one .",
    "indeed , this is the case of multimode fields when the number of modes grows . in order to overcome this limitation , we developed a modified version of the maxlik algorithm , which incorporated the constraint of finite energy for the incoming signal , i.e. , the quantity @xmath26 . in practice , we maximize the loglikelihood ( [ ll : stand ] ) with a constraint on the energy .",
    "now the function to be maximized with respect to @xmath13 is : @xmath27 @xmath20 being given in ( [ ll : stand ] ) and @xmath28 being a lagrange multiplier .",
    "the equations @xmath29 lead to : @xmath30 } \\frac{f_\\nu}{{\\sf p}_{\\nu } } = 1,\\ ] ] and , then , by multiplying both the sides of eq .",
    "( [ quasi ] ) by @xmath13 , we get a map @xmath31 , whose fixed point can be obtained by the following iterative solution : @xmath32 } \\frac{f_\\nu}{{\\sf p}^{(h)}_{\\nu}}.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath28 can be tuned in order to control the energy of the reconstructed state and improve both the convergence rate and the overall accuracy .",
    "of course , if we take @xmath33 , then eq.s  ( [ em : sol : wc ] ) and ( [ em : sol : st ] ) become the same .    indeed , in order to use eq .",
    "( [ em : sol : wc ] ) we need to know the input state energy which , in general , can not be directly accessible from experimental data .",
    "however , in cases when a model of the photon distribution of the input state is available , we can estimate _ indirectly _ this energy by a simple fit of the `` off '' probabilities .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the multimode field obtained by seeded parametric down conversion ( pdc ) . in this case",
    ", the photon distribution is expected to have the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the generalized laguerre polynomials .",
    "( [ dtpd ] ) represents the convolution of @xmath37 thermal states ( @xmath37 _ spatial _ modes ) , all with the same average number of thermal photons @xmath38 except for one , displaced by an amount @xmath39 .",
    "this model will be justified by the experimental setup described in section [ s : test ] . from eq.s  ( [ p : off ] ) and ( [ dtpd ] )",
    "we can calculate the `` off '' probability @xmath40 , that is : @xmath41 @xmath1 being the quantum efficiency of the on / off photodetector .",
    "notice that , from eq .",
    "( [ p0convthd ] ) , one can obtain the relevant cases for a poissonian input photon distribution ( @xmath42 ) and for a multithermal one ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "thanks to eq .",
    "( [ p0convthd ] ) , one can evaluate the input state energy @xmath44 , and choose a suitable value for @xmath28 .    before the end of this section",
    ", it is worth pointing out that if each spatial mode consists of @xmath45 _ temporal _ modes , then the input photon distribution and the `` off '' probability are still given by eq.s  ( [ dtpd ] ) and ( [ p0convthd ] ) , respectively , but with @xmath46 in place of @xmath37 .",
    "in order to test the reliability of the algorithm reported in eq .",
    "( [ em : sol : wc ] ) , we applied it to the reconstruction of a stimulated type - i pdc branch , at different stimulation regimes . in our experiment ,",
    "whose setup is shown in fig .  [",

    "together with the pump beam , a cw nd : yag laser ( @xmath49 nm ) is injected into the crystal in the proper way to generate stimulated pdc , and we look at the emission in the @xmath50 direction ( @xmath51 nm ) .",
    "nm is addressed to the nf and then collected by the apd . the number and temporal width of the acquisition windows",
    "is set by the pulse generator used for the detector s gating.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    different values of quantum efficiency have been obtained by inserting properly calibrated schott neutral filters ( nf ) , starting from @xmath52 ; after them , on the optical path of the stimulated branch we put an anti - infrared ( ir ) filter ( to cut off the noise due to the nd : yag laser dispersion ) , a variable pinhole ( to control the number @xmath37 of spatial propagation modes collected ) and a fiber coupler connected by a multimode fiber with the detector ( avalanche photodiode , perkin elmer spcm - aqr-15 ) . we set the pulse generator in order to open in the apd @xmath53 detection windows per second , each one of 20 ns ; the pinhole diameter is regulated in order to collect only few spatial modes ( more precisely @xmath54 ) , of whom only one stimulated . moreover ,",
    "each spatial mode consists of many temporal modes : the total number of modes can then be estimated @xmath55 .",
    "it is worth to mention that , when the number of modes exceeds few tens , the dependence on this parameter is rather small and a rough estimate of the order of magnitude suffices .",
    "we have performed three separate data collections , each one corresponding to a different stimulation regime : by indicating with @xmath56 the percentage of stimulated emission on the whole pdc amount collected , our acquisitions were respectively characterized by @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
