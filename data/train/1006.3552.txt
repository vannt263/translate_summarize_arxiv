    "the supernova remnant ( snr ) g1.9 + 0.3 has an age of order 100 years @xcite .",
    "its integrated x - ray spectrum is well described by a model of synchrotron emission from a power - law distribution with an exponential cutoff ( xspec model srcut ) , with rolloff frequency @xmath6 kev and a very high absorbing column density @xmath7 @xmath8 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) .",
    "the high column suggests a distance of order that to the galactic center ; we adopt a nominal distance of 8.5 kpc , at which the mean expansion rate is @xmath9 km s@xmath4 ( paper i ) .",
    "no thermal emission is apparent in the integrated spectrum based on short ( 50 ks in duration ) _ chandra _ observations in early 2007 . without the detection of thermal emission ,",
    "basic , crucial information such as the supernova ( sn ) type , distance , and elemental abundances can not be obtained .",
    "its detection was one of the goals of a much longer _",
    "chandra _ observation .",
    "we re - observed g1.9 + 0.3  for 237 ks with _",
    "chandra _ in four observations between july 13 and 26 , 2009 , using the acis - s ccd camera ( s3 chip ) .",
    "we checked aspect correction and created new level1 event files appropriate for vfaint mode .",
    "no flares occurred during the observation .",
    "cti correction was applied and calibration was performed using caldb version 3.4.0 .",
    "finally , the datasets were merged and weighted response files created .",
    "we extracted spectra using the specextract script .",
    "we obtained about 40,000 source counts .",
    "figure  [ 2xim ] shows the 2009 image , smoothed with the spatio - spectral method of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ rx ] compares the radio and x - ray morphologies .",
    "the marked and surprising difference between them , particularly strong radio but weak x - rays in the north , suggests that the radio image may hold a clue to the location of thermal emission .",
    "we extracted the spectrum from the radio - bright region shown on figure  [ rx ] ; it is shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "lines are apparent .",
    "we found lines as well in the central region shown in figure  [ rx ] , and analyzed the regions separately .",
    "we combined the 2007 and 2009 datasets for a total exposure of 286 ks .",
    "we modeled the background rather than subtracting it , and used markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods as implemented in the pymc software package @xcite to determine best parameter values and error ranges ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "mcmc methods require the specification of priors on parameters to be determined ( as described below ) .",
    "the spectrum of the northern , radio - bright rim is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ spec ] .",
    "spectral lines typical of strongly underionized plasma are apparent ( such plasma is expected in g1.9 + 0.3 because of its youth and the low density of the ambient ism ) .",
    "sn 1006 has a very similar x - ray spectrum ; in the same spectral range of figure  [ spec ] , @xcite find prominent k@xmath0 lines of abundant elements such as si , s , ar , ca , and fe , with line centroids at 1.815 kev , 2.36 kev , 3.01 kev , 3.69 kev , and 6.43 kev .",
    "( as in sn 1006 , o , ne , and mg lines might also be present at lower energies , but can not be seen because of the high absorption . )",
    "in addition to these lines produced in hot shocked plasma , the radioactive decay of @xmath1ti  to @xmath1sc  and finally to the stable isotope @xmath1ca will result in the emission of x - ray and @xmath10-ray lines in very young remnants ( @xmath1ti  decays with a mean life of @xmath11 yr , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this decay commences via an electron capture to @xmath1sc , leaving a k - shell vacancy followed rapidly either by auger decay or by emission of a fluorescence photon of energy 4.09 kev ( the yield is 0.172 photons per each @xmath1ti  decay ; * ? ? ?",
    "nuclear de - excitation sc @xmath10-ray lines at 78.4 and 67.9 kev are also emitted , followed by ca gamma rays at 1.157 mev ( mean life of @xmath1sc is 5.4 hr ) .",
    "an inspection of the radio - bright rim spectrum ( figure [ spec ] ) reveals the presence of si , s , ar , and fe k@xmath0 lines , and a broad feature near 4 kev that may be a blend of doppler - broadened ca and sc k@xmath0 lines .",
    "lines are generally weaker in the low - surface brightness interior ( lower panel of figure [ spec ] ) , with ar and sc lines being the most prominent .",
    "we modeled the spectra of the northern , radio - bright rim and the faint interior with an absorbed power law plus emission lines of si , s , ar , ca , sc , and fe .",
    "this simple model does not account for dust scattering and does not separate the underlying continuum into thermal and nonthermal components , but it suffices for the determination of line strengths , centroids , and widths .",
    "we used a normal ( gaussian ) prior for the absorbing column density @xmath12 , with mean ( standard deviation ) of @xmath13 @xmath8 , based on our multiregion spectral fit without dust scattering to the 2007 data ( paper ii ) .",
    "( solar abundances of the absorbing ism are those of grevesse & sauval 1998 ; fits with dust scattering resulted in @xmath12 lower by 25% . )",
    "noninformative , uniform and logarithmic priors were assumed for the power - law index @xmath14 and the ( unabsorbed ) 510 kev continuum flux @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we used normal priors for line energies , setting mean thermal line energies equal to the values measured by @xcite for sn 1006 , and to 4.09 kev for the sc line . in view of the 14,000 km s@xmath4 blast wave speed ,",
    "significant bulk doppler shifts are possible , so we chose a large ( @xmath16 km s@xmath4 ) width for these priors .",
    "( for numerical stability , these normal priors were truncated to include only a finite range in line energies ; we verified that our results are not affected by this procedure . )",
    "thermal lines in a young remnant arise in a fast - moving , shocked shell bounded by forward and reverse shocks .",
    "an optically and geometrically thin shell expanding with velocity @xmath17 produces flat - topped lines with doppler widths of @xmath18 .",
    "we assumed flat - topped profiles with the same ( but unknown ) doppler width for all thermal lines .",
    "( thermal broadening is likely of only modest importance , @xmath19 , based on models of @xcite with exponential ejecta density profiles .",
    "but it may still be appreciable in off - center locations such as the north rim , where bulk radial motions contribute less to the line broadening . )",
    "a truncated normal prior was assumed for @xmath17 , with mean of 14,000 km s@xmath4 and 1@xmath20 width of 5000 km s@xmath4 , extending from 0 to 50,000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the sc line was modeled by a gaussian with width @xmath21 ; we assumed a half - normal prior with @xmath22 kev for @xmath21 .",
    "these priors for line widths exclude very large ( @xmath23 50,000 km s@xmath4 ) widths , but otherwise provide weak constraints .",
    "some constraints on the sc line strength are provided by ibis / isgri onboard integral .",
    "the 68 and 78 kev lines have been detected by ibis / isgri in cas a @xcite but not in g1.9 + 0.3 @xcite .",
    "we use the cas a detection to bound priors . we chose a weakly informative gamma prior for the sc line strength , defined as the expected line counts in a 286 ks exposure with _",
    ", with shape parameter @xmath24 and scale parameter @xmath25 ( see @xcite for discussion of the use of gamma priors in modeling emission lines in x - ray spectra ) .",
    "its mean of @xmath26 counts is comparable to the square root of the variance , equal to @xmath27 counts .",
    "this prior disfavors a strong sc line that was searched for but not found in cas a @xcite , but otherwise provides rather weak constraints .",
    "we assumed the same weakly informative prior on line strength for thermal lines of si , s , ar , ca , and fe .",
    "the sky background was determined by a fit to the background spectrum extracted from a large area on the s3 chip .",
    "the sky background was modeled by two absorbed power - laws , while the particle background model involved a combination of power - laws with exponential cutoffs and narrow fluorescent lines .",
    "we allowed for spatial variations in the particle background , with a logarithmic prior imposed on the particle normalization .",
    "table  [ lineflux ] contains results of spectral fits ; models are plotted in figure  [ spec ] . except for fluxes , values quoted in table  [ lineflux ] are standard means of the mcmc draws .",
    "we used a geometric mean for @xmath15 , and mean line fluxes @xmath28 were evaluated as @xmath29 ( according to recommendations by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the 90%  confidence intervals were computed using the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles of the draws .",
    "the sc line width is poorly constrained , so we provide only upper limits based on the 90%  highest probability density interval for @xmath21 .",
    "the sc line and thermal lines of all abundant elements have appreciable strengths in the spectrum of the northern rim .",
    "thermal lines are very broad , with a full width of 28,000 km s@xmath4 , consistent with the estimated shock velocity of 14,000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the fe k@xmath0 line provides the strongest constraints on line widths , but doppler broadening is important for other lines as well .",
    "photon statistics are insufficient to study variations in doppler widths between different elements .",
    "this includes sc , with a width that does not seem to be different from thermal line widths .",
    "but sc forms a line blend with ca , so errors are particularly large for these elements . in the interior ,",
    "thermal lines are much weaker ; an inspection of the confidence intervals in table 1 suggests that only ar may have been unambiguously detected . notwithstanding",
    "this decline in the overall strength of thermal lines , the sc line remains strong ( it is only a factor of 2 weaker than in the northern rim ) .",
    "the prominence of sc in the interior is consistent with an origin in the unshocked ejecta .    in both spectral regions",
    "independently , we examined the significance of the sc line detection using a likelihood ratio test as described in @xcite .",
    "the null model consisted of an absorbed power law plus si , s , ar , ca and fe lines described by flat line profiles with equal ( but unknown ) doppler widths , together with the same priors that we used for our spectral fits .",
    "the alternative model is obtained by adding an additional line at 4.09 kev to the null model .",
    "large samples from the posterior distribution of the null model were obtained using mcmc simulations . from these samples we simulated synthetic datasets , fit each dataset with the null model and the alternative model , and computed the likelihood ratio statistic .",
    "the posterior predictive @xmath30-values for the null model are 0.0098 and 0.030 for the northern rim and interior , respectively .",
    "the @xmath30-value is equal to 0.00029 for the null model to be valid in both of these regions .",
    "we can therefore reject the null model , i.e. , claim the detection of the 4.1 kev line , at 99.971% significance .    the total sc line flux was derived by combining the spectra shown in figure  [ spec ] , and fitting the combined dataset separately with the same spectral model as before .",
    "we obtain a total sc line flux of @xmath31 ph @xmath8 s@xmath4 , with a 95%  confidence interval of @xmath32 ph @xmath8 s@xmath4 .",
    "the column density of @xmath33 @xmath8 implies that x - rays of 4.1 kev are attenuated by about 33% due both to absorption and scattering .",
    "the sc line fluxes have not been corrected for this , but the correction has been made for the @xmath1ti masses that are discussed next .",
    "we expect 0.172 fluorescence photons per @xmath1sc  atom .",
    "thus the line flux , along with the source age and distance , gives directly the amount of @xmath1ti  synthesized in the explosion .",
    "including the branching ratio for the emission of the 1.157 mev photon , we expect the flux of x - ray photons to be related to that in 1.157 mev photons by @xmath34 .",
    "the gamma - ray flux is related to the mass of @xmath1ti  by @xmath35 with the mean life @xmath36 yr .",
    "( if the @xmath1ti  is ionized beyond the he - like state , the effective lifetime is longer @xcite , but the low ionization age of fe implied by the line centroid reported in table  [ lineflux ] means that this effect should be negligible . )",
    "we used these relations with an age of 100 yr to obtain the following @xmath1ti masses : @xmath37 in the north , @xmath38 in the interior , and @xmath39 for the total .",
    "( errors are 90% confidence limits for the two subregions , but 95% limits for the total . )",
    "these masses have been corrected for absorption and scattering by being multiplied by a factor of @xmath40 . for an age of 140 yr ( corresponding to no deceleration at all )",
    ", the masses would be larger by an additional factor of 1.54 .",
    "we also modeled the spectrum of the northern , radio - bright rim with a plane shock non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model ( vpshock in xspec ) .",
    "we find @xmath41 @xmath8 ; @xmath42 kev ; and ionization timescale @xmath43 @xmath44 s. this extremely low ionization age is very unusual for snrs , but appropriate for an unprecedentedly young object .",
    "abundances have substantial errors , but solar abundances are ruled out : compared to solar , si ( set equal to s ) = 3.4 ( 2.0 , 4.6 ) , ar = 17 ( 2.8 , 37 ) , and fe = 4.1(2.4 , 5.7 ) .",
    "a blueshift of line centers is required , @xmath45 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we find a fwhm of @xmath46 km s@xmath4 . with @xmath47 @xmath44 ,",
    "the estimated shocked ejecta mass is only @xmath48 , with comparable masses of intermediate - mass ( si , s , and ar ) elements and fe .",
    "this is a quarter of the total shocked ambient gas mass of @xmath49 ( for a preshock density of @xmath50 @xmath44 and a blast wave radius of 2.2 pc ; paper i ) .",
    "impact of the ejecta with a denser than average ambient medium in the north may explain the relatively high shocked ejecta mass and density , and the strong radio emission there .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    1 .",
    "the radio - bright n rim region shows strong k@xmath0 lines of si , s , ar , ca , and fe ( much weaker thermal emission is also present in the shell interior ) .",
    "2 .   the spectral lines are both broadened and shifted .",
    "widths of thermal lines are @xmath51 km s@xmath4 with blueshifts of about 4,000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "3 .   global spectral fits with a plane - shock model",
    "imply strong overabundances of the elements we detect , consistent with their interpretation as ejecta dominated by intermediate - mass elements and fe .",
    "we detect for the first time with high significance a line at 4.1 kev which we attribute to @xmath1sc .",
    "the line strength of about @xmath31 ph @xmath8 s@xmath4 implies a mass of @xmath1ti  of @xmath52 , after correction for absorption and assuming an age of 100 yr and a distance of 8.5 kpc .",
    "we detect @xmath1sc  separately in the northern shell and the interior , with greater strength in the shell .",
    "we believe the discovery of @xmath1sc  emission to be the most important new result . a feature at 4.1 kev identified with @xmath1sc  has been reported previously in g266.21.2 ( rx j0852.0 - 4622 ) by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and , more comprehensively , @xcite have failed to confirm these reports , at a level below the previous detection claims .",
    "it appears that g1.9 + 0.3 shows the first definite detection of this transition .",
    "our line strength implies a flux in the 1.157 mev line of about @xmath53 ph @xmath8 s@xmath4 , well below the comptel limit of about @xmath54 ph @xmath8 s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "while our inferred @xmath1ti  mass is nominally in conflict with the upper limit of @xmath55 reported by @xcite , the errors are large enough to accommodate it .",
    "@xmath1ti , a trace product of explosive nucleosynthesis , carries important information about the details of the explosion @xcite .",
    "it is primarily produced in `` @xmath0-rich freezeout '' conditions , in which rapid cooling causes departures from nuclear statistical equilibrium and a high concentration of free @xmath0 particles . in core - collapse ( cc )",
    "sne , its production is sensitive to the location of the mass cut ( within which material becomes the neutron star ) , and in most models its production is correlated with that of @xmath56ni , and therefore with the supernova luminosity .",
    "predicted yields range from 3 to @xmath57 ( see summary in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "traditional sn ia models undergo @xmath0-rich freezeout under somewhat different conditions and do not produce large quantities of @xmath1ti .",
    "however , recent simulations of off - center delayed - detonation explosions have shown substantially increased yields : @xcite quote a mass of @xmath1ti  of @xmath58 , compared to @xmath59 for a centrally - ignited pure deflagration and @xmath60 for a central delayed detonation .",
    "( for comparison , the benchmark w7 type ia model [ nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ] gives @xmath61 , while a series of more recent simulations by @xcite gives a range from @xmath62 . )",
    "galactic constraints on the supernova rate can be obtained from the observed abundance of @xmath1ca , and the absence of obvious discrete sources of 1.157 mev @xmath10-ray emission , with the important exception of cas a , the only firm detection to date @xcite .",
    "the accompanying hard x - ray lines have also been seen from cas a @xcite , with an inferred mass of @xmath1ti  of about @xmath63 , more than expected from most cc models ( @xmath64 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though asymmetric models can do better ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the 4.1 kev inner - shell transition of @xmath1sc  formed from electron capture in @xmath1ti  does not require that the scandium be ionized , we are sensitive to both shocked and unshocked material .",
    "this is evident in the interior spectrum in figure  [ spec ] , in which the @xmath1sc  line is as prominent as in the north rim , but the other lines are weaker .",
    "the greater abundance of @xmath1sc  in the north , then , represents a true spatial distribution  surprising , considering that the @xmath1sc  is expected to be produced in the neighborhood of the fe - peak elements , that is , the innermost ejecta .",
    "these properties suggest that the explosion was substantially asymmetric , perhaps consistent with the greater production of @xmath1tifound in asymmetric explosion models such as @xcite . while he - shell denotations that trigger sub - chandrasekhar thermonuclear explosions can also be invoked to explain the presence of asymmetrically - distributed @xmath1ti  and fe in the outermost ejecta layers , too much @xmath1ti  is produced even in sub - chandrasekhar explosion models with minimum he shell masses @xcite",
    ". a substantially longer observation should allow better spatial localization of the @xmath1sc  emission , and an unprecedented view into supernova nucleosynthesis .",
    "our discovery of these spectral lines , and the @xmath1sc  line in particular , remains consistent with the possibility that g1.9 + 0.3resulted from a type ia event , a possibility we find increasingly likely .",
    "the bilaterally symmetric synchrotron ",
    "x - ray morphology , the extremely high shock velocities we both infer and measure from line broadening , and the prominent fe k emission , all support a type ia origin .",
    "we have not yet ruled out a cc origin , however ; while strong iron emission is unusual in cc remnants , cas a is a counterexample , and it is possible that a cc origin can explain the other features as well .",
    "what is certainly clear is that g1.9 + 0.3  still has a great deal to teach us about the evolution of very young snrs and about the supernovae that produced them .",
