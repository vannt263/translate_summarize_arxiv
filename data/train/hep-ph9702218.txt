    "the contact terms of spin - non - flip type contribute to the hyperfine splitting calculation only through the second- or higher - order perturbation terms , analogous to the case of the darwin or relativistic kinetic energy potentials .",

    "the lowest order spin - non - flip contact term is of order @xmath70 , which gives the relativistic binding correction to the lamb shift .",

    "the lowest order diagrams contributing to the contact term relevant to the breit correction is the two - photon - exchange process between the electron and muon , namely , one - loop process . in order to contribute to the breit correction ,",

    "this reduces the relevant nrqed scattering amplitudes to the following five combinations : a coulomb potential with a fermi potential , a fermi potential with a relativistic kinetic energy term and a coulomb potential , a fermi potential with a darwin potential , a coulomb potential with a derivative fermi potential , and a seagull potential .",
    "the first four are given by the second order perturbation theory of the nrqed hamiltonian and the fifth is from the tree nrqed hamiltonian .",

    "[ bhamil](a ) .    in this case",
    "the qed scattering amplitude at threshold is completely replicated by the nrqed scattering amplitude consisting of a coulomb potential and a fermi potential .",

    "the one - loop contact terms determined in this comparison are all linearly divergent and hence their values depend on how they are regularized .",
    "although gauge invariant regularization method is desirable , it is possible in this case to use a simple momentum cut - off .",
    "this is because , as we shall see in appendix a , calculation of the @xmath75 @xmath76 expectation value also leads to a divergent integral and must be regularized .",
    "even though the regularized bound state calculation is not gauge invariant , the gauge invariance can be restored if one chooses appropriate contact terms .",
    "what is crucial is that the regularization method of the contact term is consistent with the bound state calculation @xcite .",
    "we satisfy this requirement by introducing an uv cut - off @xmath23 in the momentum of the transverse exchanged photon in both contact term calculation and bound state calculation .",
    "the nrqed scattering diagrams can be easily written down using the nrqed feynman rule given in fig .",
    "@xcite . against the relativistic kinetic energy term",
    "this rule leads to the contact term of the form v_1c - k = -2 ^ v_f(0 , ) v_k ( ) v_c(,0 )  .",
    "[ v_1c - k ] here the factor two is to take account of the time - reversed diagram .",
    "the contact terms against the darwin term , derivative fermi term , and seagull term can be similarly constructed and evaluated . explicit evaluation of ( [ v_1c - k ] ) and other terms is carried out in appendix a.    next we consider the three photon exchange process , or two - loop one , shown in fig .",
    "[ bhamil](b ) .",
    "this requires adding one more coulomb photon exchange potential to both qed and nrqed amplitudes of the two photon exchange type .",
    "adding another type of potential of nrqed , such as the darwin potential , is not necessary since it gives a power of @xmath77 higher than what we are interested in .",

    "[ bhamil](b ) ) contribution is equivalent to the first diagram of the nrqed contribution ( on the right - hand - side of fig . [ bhamil](b ) ) .",
    "thus the contact terms are determined by the rest of the nrqed scattering amplitudes .",
    "processes with four or more photon exchange clearly have more explicit powers of @xmath17 , yielding higher order contact terms .",
    "thus we do nt have to deal with them as far as we are interested only in the @xmath22 breit correction .",
    "some of the two - loop contact terms , which have a coulomb photon exchange potential sandwiched between two other kinds of potentials , are logarithmically divergent in both uv and ir regions and will kill uv divergences in the bound state calculation .",
    "others are linearly divergent in both uv and ir .",
    "these diagrams have the structure such that one coulomb photon potential is added to the edge of one loop linear uv divergent diagrams proportional to @xmath78 introduced in the two photon exchange comparison .",
    "the additional coulomb photon on the edge yields the threshold ir singularity causing the term to be proportional to @xmath79 , where @xmath19 is the photon mass introduced as the ir cut - off .",
    "the multiplication of the uv and ir divergences results in the form @xmath80 .",
    "the uv - ir singularity @xmath80 appearing in these diagrams is completely canceled out by the diagram which consists of the one - loop contact term introduced before and the coulomb photon potential connected by the free fermion propagators . here",
