    "in the course of our _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) spectroscopic study of the m31 globular cluster g1 ( go-9099 , cycle  10 ) , we obtained a deep parallel wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) image of a nearby field in the halo of m31 .",
    "the globular cluster g1 is one of the most luminous in the local group and has an substantial abundance spread ( meylan et  al .",
    "there is dynamical evidence for a central black hole ( gebhardt , rich , & ho 2002 ) based on the analysis of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) spectra of m31 obtained in the _ hst _ campaign .",
    "the object g1 has been proposed as the nucleus of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy perhaps in the process of being tidally disrupted in the m31 halo .",
    "this argument has been strengthened by the survey of ferguson et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) which shows what appears to be a tidal plume of stars located very near the position of g1 ( at least in projection ) .",
    "if the tidal plume did in fact originate from a dwarf spheroidal galaxy similar to the present - day andromeda dwarfs , it might be expected to have a blue horizontal branch ( hb ) in its color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , a feature that is seen in every m31 dwarf spheroidal companion ( da  costa et  al .  1996 , 2000 ; da  costa , armandroff , & caldwell 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , the tidal plumes might be related to a companion similar to the compact elliptical satellite m32 , which is undergoing tidal stripping ( choi , guhathakurta , & johnston 2002 ) and for which existing deep cmds show only a red hb ( grillmair et  al .  1996 ) .",
    "deep images in the vicinity of g1 might detect the stellar population from the hypothetical dwarf spheroidal galaxy of which g1 is proposed to be the nucleus .",
    "the stis spectroscopic exposure was long enough to permit a total of 7.1  hr of wfpc2 integration on a parallel imaging field @xmath6 n of g1 .",
    "the field lies @xmath7 ( extrapolated ) radial scale lengths out in the outer `` disk '' of m31 ( walterbos & kennicutt 1988 ) .",
    "this parallel image is much longer than typical _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 imaging of the m31 halo ( typically a total of @xmath8  orbits in two colors ) , and is in fact the deepest image of a remote m31 major axis field obtained to date .",
    "the first deep stellar photometry of the m31 halo was undertaken by mould & kristian ( 1986 ) , revealing an old red giant branch ( rgb ) with a wide range of metal abundance .",
    "a series of ground - based and _ hst _ studies ( e.g. ,  durrell , harris , & pritchet 1994 , 2001 ; rich , mighell , & neill 1996b ; holland , fahlman , & richer 1996 ; reitzel , guhathakurta & gould 1998 ; sarajedini & van duyne 2001 ) find @xmath5\\sim-0.7 $ ] in a number of m31 halo fields .",
    "these _ hst _ studies of m31 halo fields show that the hb is dominated by the red clump with roughly 15% blue stars ( see bellazzini et  al .",
    "2003 ) and that the rgb is metal rich , as mentioned earlier .",
    "two prior deep imaging studies sampling m31 s disk are worth noting here .",
    "rich et  al .",
    "( 1996a ) image the globular cluster g1 using the pc1 ccd on wfpc2 and use the wf ccd frames to examine the field population very near the location of the field presented in this paper .",
    "they find that the field population is metal rich ( @xmath9  dex ) .",
    "this early study notes that the field luminosity function ( lf ) rises anomalously steeply below the hb ( relative to an old population and relative to g1 ) , but the photometry is too shallow to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "although we do not reach the main - sequence turnoff point , our new photometry suggests that the excess of faint stars noted by rich et  al .",
    "( 1996a ) is real .",
    "ferguson & johnson ( 2001 ) analyze archival wfpc2 imagery of an outer disk field on the opposite side of the major axis , some 30  kpc ne of the nucleus .",
    "they find a red clump and a metal - rich rgb , similar to the findings of the rich et  al .",
    "( 1996a ) and present studies .",
    "ferguson & johnson reach @xmath10 and do not report a lf , but argue from the luminosity and characteristics of the red clump that the bulk of the stars must be @xmath11  gyr old .",
    "if these remote m31 fields are dominated by stellar debris from prior interactions , one might expect to find differences among the cmds of the various fields .",
    "recent ultra - deep imaging of a se minor - axis field ( 11  kpc from m31 s nucleus in projection ) using _ hst _ s advanced camera for surveys ( brown et  al.2003 ) reaches well below the main - sequence turnoff for an old stellar population .",
    "this study indicates that the most metal - rich stars , about a third of all the stars along this line of sight , are only @xmath12  gyr old .",
    "a possible hypothesis is that these stars have been stirred up from m31 s disk .",
    "the spectroscopic study by reitzel & guhathakurta ( 2002 ) in a more remote minor - axis field also finds that the most metal - rich giants may be related to m31 s disk , and preliminary spectroscopic results suggest that the same may be true in the brown et  al",
    ".  field ( guhathakurta & reitzel 2002 ) .",
    "the outer disk of m31 and the disk - halo transition region may provide critical clues for understanding the formation of large spiral galaxies like our own .",
    "the wfpc2 imaging presented in this paper was obtained in october  2001 , in parallel with stis spectroscopy of the core of g1 . because small moves were executed only along the stis slit",
    ", we do not have a true dither pattern for our field .",
    "constrained by the parallel observations , our field lies at @xmath13 , @xmath14 , offset from g1 only in declination by @xmath15 . in projection ,",
    "the field lies @xmath16  kpc from g1 , and @xmath17  kpc from the nucleus of m31 .",
    "this places our field well outside the tidal radius measured by meylan et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , yet near enough to g1 so that it should sample the population of any putative dwarf spheroidal galaxy that might once have been associated with it .",
    "our field also falls within a possible tidal plume near the m31 outer disk / halo ( ferguson et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "our total integration time is 3.11  hr in f606w and 4.0  hr in f814w ( roughly equivalent to a broad @xmath1 and @xmath2 band , respectively ) .",
    "this is a factor of  2.7 longer than typical m31 globular cluster images , which usually total only 4  orbits of integration time .",
    "bias and flat - field corrections are applied to the data as part of the standard _ hst _",
    "data processing pipeline .",
    "masking of bad columns and pixels , cosmic - ray removal , and masking of hot pixels are accomplished using the utilities provided in the hstphot package ( dolphin 2000 ) .",
    "the cleaned images are aligned and median combined to produce a final f606w and f814w image .",
    "stars are identified and fitted on the combined f606w+f814w image using hstphot .",
    "hstphot is a point - spread - function ( psf)-fitting stellar photometry package similar to daophot ( stetson 1987 ) , and is designed to handle undersampled psfs such as those found in wfpc2 images . hstphot uses a library of tinytim psfs for different locations across the ccd and for different locations of the star s center within the pixel .",
    "psf fits are also carried out independently in the coadded f606w and f814w images in order to derive stellar photometry in the two bands .",
    "the instrumental _ hst _ magnitudes are converted to johnson / cousins @xmath1 and @xmath2 using the color transformation relations of holtzman et  al .",
    "we also performed experiments using daophot and simple aperture photometry , but found no improvement over our approach .",
    "objects are required to have an _ overall _ @xmath18 in the combined f606w+f814w image and a @xmath18 in the f606w band ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the use of such conservative thresholds ensures that the sample is practically free of noise detections as confirmed by subsequent visual inspection .",
    "a further cut of @xmath20 in the f814w band ( @xmath21 ) is applied for the purpose of constructing the cmd whereas the f814w cut is relaxed to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) for the construction of the lf .",
    "the exact values of these 5- , 3- , and 1-@xmath24 limiting magnitudes depend on the `` local sky '' background level which varies across the image because of stellar surface density fluctuations and proximity to bright stars ; the mean limiting magnitudes for the sample are listed above .",
    "in addition to the s / n cuts , objects are required to pass a @xmath25 cut ( i.e. ,  good fit to the _ hst _ psf ) and @xmath26 cut ( to reject noise spikes , galaxies , and blends ) .",
    "finally , each surviving candidate star is inspected on the coadded wfpc2 f606w and f814w images .",
    "about 6% of these objects are found to be spurious ( mostly diffraction spikes and saturation bleed artifacts near bright stars ) and are eliminated from the sample .    using hstphot , artificial stars with @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are inserted into the images .",
    "they are added in groups of  1750 over the field of each wf ccd , and in groups of 50 for the smaller pc1 field , in ten separate runs . for each run , the resulting image is analyzed with hstphot and the recovered objects are required to pass the same selection criteria as the program stars . to quantify the degree of completeness and error / systematic bias in the photometry of faint stars , we construct a recovery matrix .",
    "its rows and columns correspond to the input ( true ) and recovered magnitudes of the artificial star , respectively , while the matrix elements give the fraction of stars recovered at all input / output apparent magnitudes .",
    "we multiply the theoretical lfs by the recovery matrix , and compare the result to our observed lf .",
    "figure  1 shows the cmd for our remote m31 major - axis field near g1 .",
    "the appearance of the cmd of the field population is consistent with that reported by rich et  al .",
    "( 1996a ) : there is a clearly - defined rgb , while the hb is in the form of a red clump and lacks blue stars .",
    "most significantly , there appears to be a sharp rise in the number of stars fainter than the red clump .",
    "this feature is confirmed after careful exclusion of spurious objects , after accounting for background galaxies , and via artificial star tests .",
    "the observed color spread at faint end of the cmd is mostly driven by f814w photometric errors . by contrast , the lf analysis described below does not rely on f814w photometry ; it takes advantage of the greater depth of the f606w data by relaxing the f814w s / n threshold used for sample selection (  3 ) .",
    "isochrones from the padova models ( girardi et  al .",
    "2000 ) are overlaid on the cmd .",
    "the red giants straddle the @xmath5=-0.7 $ ] isochrone for an old ( 13  gyr ) population .",
    "the field giant metallicities inferred from a comparison with galactic globular cluster rgb fiducials are identical to those derived using model isochrones .",
    "the photometric metallicity estimates would be @xmath29  dex higher if the field population were of order 8  gyr old instead of 13  gyr .",
    "not surprisingly , these conclusions agree with those drawn by rich et  al .",
    "( 1996a ) based on field stars directly adjacent to g1 .",
    "the relatively high metallicity in these outer disk regions of m31 contrasts with the lower values found in the outer reaches of the local group sc galaxies m33 and ngc  2403 ( davidge 2003 ) .",
    "one may attribute this difference to the considerably lower luminosities and later hubble types of these galaxies .",
    "our m31 field cmd is similar to that seen in the outer disk field of ferguson & johnson ( 2001 ) ; however , their field appears to have a more prominent blue extension ( presumably a small number of young main sequence stars ) .",
    "there is a handful of blue objects with @xmath30 and @xmath31 in our g1 field cmd .",
    "these may be compact background field galaxies , even though they look unresolved upon inspection of the coadded wfpc2 f606w and f814w images , and pass the @xmath32 and sharpness criteria for stars .",
    "there is also the possibility that these blue objects are young main - sequence stars in m31 s disk , given the association we are finding with neutral hydrogen in the vicinity ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the central result of our paper : the stellar lf in the @xmath1 band in our 34  kpc major - axis field near g1 compared to models .",
    "two points are immediately evident from this plot and the cmd in figure  1 .",
    "first , the hb is in the form of a red clump , indicating a large population of stars older than a few  gyr ( assuming age is the `` second parameter '' that determines hb morphology ) .",
    "second , a model in which the entire population is old is not a good fit to the data .",
    "the @xmath1-band lf is formed by applying a less stringent selection criterion than was used for the cmd : @xmath33 in f606w , but only @xmath34 in f814w , combined with our shape criteria and visual inspection .",
    "even though this allows marginal f814w detections to be accepted , we feel confident with this choice because : ( a )  the f606w and overall s / n criteria are conservative , ( b )  the predicted galaxy counts are relatively low ( circles in figure  2 ) so contamination from misclassified galaxies should be negligible , and ( c )  the nature of the cmd suggests that we are measuring bona fide stars in m31 .",
    "while it appears that some intermediate - age stars must be present , figure  2 also shows that much of the field is likely old and is not dominated by stars significantly younger than 5  gyr .",
    "padova lfs ( girardi et  al .",
    "2000 ) , most with @xmath5=-0.7 $ ] and one with @xmath5=-1.3 $ ] , are normalized to our observed m31 field lf at @xmath35 , just below the hb .",
    "( it is impractical to normalize at the hb in figure  2 because the @xmath1  magnitude of the hb peak varies with age / metallicity and the models do not all match the hb peak position seen in the data . ) the theoretical lfs have been multiplied by the artificial star results matrix .",
    "while the matrix - convolved theoretical lfs match the overall shape of the observed lf , they fail to reproduce the faint end in detail : incompleteness is observed to set in about 0.5  mag brighter than the predictions of the artificial star tests .",
    "the mismatch in the faint end rolloff has no effect on our finding that the observed counts exceed , by more than a factor of three , the prediction for a purely old stellar population .",
    "a lower metallicity does produce a slightly brighter turnoff at a given age ( see model lf with @xmath5=-1.3 $ ] shown by the short dashed curve in figure  2 ) , but this does not match the color / shape of the rgb ( figure  1 ) . there is no plausible alternative to normalizing the theoretical lfs to the data that changes this result .",
    "the observed galaxy counts in the hubble deep field south are plotted as open circles in figure  2 and show no rise which can account for the observed lf ( volonteri et  al.2001 ) .",
    "more precise constraints on the age will require deeper data , but for the moment , we conclude that the stellar population near g1 contains a large number of intermediate - age stars .",
    "the bright portions of the model lfs ( rgb , hb ) in figure  2 do not agree perfectly with the data .",
    "the field giants in the observed lf are deficient in number by about a factor of two at @xmath36 , and the hb bump at @xmath37 ( sensitive to the he burning lifetime ) is slightly underabundant relative to the models .",
    "the models may not be particularly well suited to predicting these late stages of stellar evolution .",
    "moreover , the actual population is almost certain to be a composite spanning a range in age and metallicity .",
    "the skeptical reader might choose to ignore any data fainter than @xmath10 , even though we have taken great care to ensure the validity of faint star measurements , and despite the very clear stellar detections at yet fainter magnitudes .",
    "even at @xmath10 , the old population falls short by a factor of  2.5 in explaining the observed counts .",
    "we conclude that there is compelling evidence for intermediate - age stars in this field , but that deeper imaging is required to establish definitive proof of their existence and to determine their precise age distribution .",
    "we are convinced that the observed rise in our field lf starting at @xmath38 is _ not _ due to noise spikes mismeasured as stars near the limiting magnitude of our data . as a check",
    ", we have reduced archival wfpc2 images of the cluster g1 ( r.m.r .",
    "s go-5464 program ) using hstphot in a manner identical to that described in  3 .",
    "figure  3 compares the resulting g1 cluster lf to our field lf , with the curves normalized at the hb ( the lfs in figure  2 were normalized at @xmath35 but that is uncomfortably close to the incompleteness limit of the g1 lf ) . while the cluster dataset is 1.5  mag shallower because of its shorter exposure time , it does not show any rise due to spurious detections near its limiting magnitude .      the presence of an enormous warped disk of neutral hydrogen ( newton & emerson 1977 ) and an exponential distribution of carbon stars extending out to a radius of 35  kpc ( battinelli , demers , & letarte 2003 ) both favor the existence of an extended disk in m31 .",
    "we argue that the underlying stellar population in our 34  kpc major - axis field is consistent with a disk population that is many gyr old .    the accompanying paper by reitzel , guhathakurta , & rich ( 2003 ) reports on spectroscopy of red giants in the g1 field .",
    "they find that the mean radial velocity of the main concentration of red giants , @xmath39 , disagrees with both the radial velocity of g1 and the systemic velocity of m31 , but is in excellent agreement with the radial velocity of neutral hydrogen in the disk of m31 located 32  kpc from the nucleus ( cram , roberts , & whitehurst 1980 ) .",
    "these observations point to a kinematic link between the stellar population near g1 and the neutral hydrogen in the outer disk of m31 . we are led to conclude that the faint stellar population near g1 relates to the extended formation history of the outer disk and",
    "does not belong to a dwarf spheroidal galaxy associated with g1 , as some have suggested .",
    "is this population actually the thick disk of m31 proposed by sarajedini & van duyne ( 2001 ) ?",
    "the cmd in figure  1 and especially the lf in figure  2 are consistent with an intermediate - age population , while the milky way thick disk is considered to be old .",
    "we would further argue that the kinematic connection to the neutral hydrogen lying only some 2  kpc away ( in projection ) would not be expected for a thick disk population resembling that of the milky way ( old , metal poor , and with kinematics intermediate between those of the thin disk and halo ) .",
    "moreover , the velocity dispersion of the putative disk stars in the vicinity of g1 is too low to be consistent with a thick disk origin ( reitzel et  al .",
    "deeper photometry and a larger sample of radial velocities will be required to settle the reality of this connection .",
    "the cmd in our major - axis field bears little resemblance to those of the andromeda dwarf spheroidal companions , which always have some blue hb stars and are usually more metal poor ( da  costa et  al .",
    "1996 , 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "there is also no similarity to the outer fields of m32 ( grillmair et  al .",
    "1996 ) where the giants are much more metal rich ( @xmath5=-0.4 $ ] ) . unlike our field , g1 has a well - detected blue hb , but the rgb of g1 is similar to that of our field . as emphasized in the earlier study of rich et  al .",
    "( 1996a ) , the field population near g1 most closely resembles other m31 halo fields",
    ". an _ hst _",
    "field on the opposite side of the major axis of m31 has been analyzed ( ferguson & johnson 2001 ; bellazzini et  al .",
    "2003 ) and qualitatively resembles our field , though there is a more significant hint of a blue hb in that field .",
    "our cmd more closely resembles the bright portion of the ultra - deep minor - axis halo field studied by brown et  al .",
    "a metal - rich rgb dominates the population , and some fraction of the stars in our field appear to be youthful .",
    "were it not for the kinematic connection to the outer neutral hydrogen disk of m31 , it would be difficult to argue that the stellar population is not somehow connected to the halo field of brown et  al.(2003 ) .",
    "we conclude that the spatial location , kinematics of the bright giants , and the extreme sparseness of the blue hb all favor the connection to the outer disk rather than to the overall halo , but only deeper photometry in this field can settle the issue .",
    "we present photometry for a remote major - axis field of m31 located @xmath40 n of the luminous globular cluster g1 .",
    "the total integration time is 7.11  hr and the photometry reaches @xmath3 , making this one of the deepest fields imaged in the m31 outskirts , aside from the recent brown et  al .",

    "there is a clearly - defined rgb with @xmath5\\approx-0.7 $ ] ; the hb is represented by the red clump only .",
    "we conclude that the steep rise seen near the faint end of the lf must be due to the onset of the subgiant branch in an intermediate - age stellar population . noting the agreement between the stellar kinematics in this field and that of the neutral hydrogen in the outer disk of m31 ( reitzel et  al .",
    "2003 ) , we are led to suspect that , in addition to what appears to have been an old star - formation episode , the outer disk gas has continued to fuel more recent star formation .    we conclude that , in general , the stellar population in the field near g1 is different from that of the cluster itself . while their rgbs and red clumps are comparable , the field lacks a blue hb , even with our deeper photometry .",
    "this lack of a blue hb also distinguishes the field from the andromeda dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the qualitative properties of the cmd in our major - axis field resemble those seen in other m31 halo fields . however , the field star lf is different from those of old metal - rich globular clusters like 47  tuc in the milky way or g1 in m31 .",
    "the lf shows evidence of an extended and complex star formation history and a connection to the outer neutral hydrogen disk of m31 , as supported by the dynamics reported in reitzel et  al .",
    "the dominant population in this field is @xmath41  gyr old , leading us to conclude that the outer disk of m31 had a significantly greater rate of star formation in the past than it does today .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by ferguson & johnson ( 2001 ) . despite our field lying in a relatively disturbed region of the m31 halo ,",
    "the cmd is remarkably similar to that found by ferguson & johnson on the opposite side of the m31 disk .",
    "the high metallicity seen in both of these outer disk fields is interesting , as the stars have formed in a very low density environment .",
    "the inferred higher rate of star formation @xmath41  gyr ago would imply a brighter m31 disk at a look - back time of a third of the hubble time , broadly consistent with what is seen in disk galaxies at moderate redshift ( lilly et  al .",
    "rotation curve measurements of field and cluster spirals indicate that the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation for large galaxies like the milky way and m31 was more or less in place by @xmath42 , albeit shifted with respect to the local relation suggesting that galaxies were brighter by about 1  mag in the rest - frame optical 7  gyr ago ( e.g. ,  deep1 survey ",
    "vogt et  al .",
    "this is not necessarily in conflict with our finding of a @xmath8  gyr population in m31 s outer disk .",
    "firstly , not all the stars in the g1 field are of intermediate age ; there probably is an underlying population of stars older than 7  gyr and it is presumably their counterparts that are being sampled by the @xmath42 tf surveys .",
    "secondly , our g1 field is located in m31 s faint outer disk whereas the distant galaxy surveys are only sensitive to the bright star - forming inner parts of disks .",

    "<S> we present photometry from _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst_)/wide field planetary camera  2 parallel imagery of a remote m31 field at a projected distance of @xmath0 kpc from the nucleus near the sw major axis . </S>",

    "<S> the f606w ( @xmath1 ) and f814w ( @xmath2 ) images were obtained in parallel with space telescope imaging spectrograph spectroscopy of g1 ( go-9099 ) and total 7.11  hours of integration time  the deepest _ hst _ field in the outer disk of m31 to date , reaching to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the color - magnitude diagram of the field shows a clearly - defined red clump at @xmath4 and a red giant branch consistent with @xmath5\\approx-0.7 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of a blue horizontal branch contrasts with other m31 halo fields , the andromeda dwarf spheroidals , and with the nearby globular cluster g1 . comparing the observed luminosity function to the padova models </S>",
    "<S> , we find that at least some of the stellar population must be younger than 68  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the outermost detected neutral hydrogen disk of m31 lies only 2  kpc in projection from our field . </S>",
    "<S> the finding that some giants in the field have radial velocities close to that of the neutral hydrogen gas ( reitzel , guhathakurta , & rich 2003 ) leads us to conclude that our field samples the old , low - surface - brightness disk rather than the true population  ii spheroid or the remnants of a disrupted m31 satellite . </S>"
