    "in the transition region between the chromosphere and corona of the sun , the kinetic temperature suddenly jumps from @xmath3  k to @xmath4  k and the plasma changes from partially to practically fully ionized .",
    "although various physical mechanisms have been proposed for explaining this temperature increase , the lack of reliable measurements of key physical quantities , such as the magnetic field , represents today the most serious limitation to a better comprehension of the role played by this boundary region on the heating of the solar corona . in order to make measurements of the quantities that remain basically unknown , we need ( 1 ) to identify observables sensitive to the physical conditions of the solar transition region , ( 2 ) to develop the instruments needed for measuring such observables , and ( 3 ) to infer the relevant physical quantities ( e.g. , the strength and orientation of the magnetic field ) through realistic modeling of the measured observables .",
    "recently , @xcite argued that the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line at 1216     should show measurable scattering polarization signals when observing the solar disk , and that via the hanle effect the line - center amplitudes of the @xmath2 and @xmath5 linear polarization profiles must be sensitive to the strength and orientation of the magnetic field in the solar transition region ( with good sensitivity to magnetic field strengths between 10 and 100  g ) . in a subsequent paper , @xcite pointed out that significant line - center scattering polarization signals are to be expected also for the ly@xmath0 line of he  ii at 304   , and that for the magnetic field strengths expected at transition region heights ( i.e. , @xmath6  g outside active regions ) the he  ii 304    line , due to its very large einstein coefficient , is immune to the hanle effect ( i.e. , it is a line whose observed linear polarization pattern could be used as a reference for facilitating the identification of the observational signature of the hanle effect in the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line ) .",
    "the possibility that scattering processes produce measurable linear polarization signals in these and other emission lines of the solar transition region is of great scientific interest , because it is mainly through the hanle effect that we may hope to explore the magnetism of the upper chromosphere and transition region of the sun . as a matter of fact , with few exceptions",
    ", the polarization signals induced by the zeeman effect in transition region lines are expected to be very weak ( e.g. , in typical semi - empirical models of the solar atmosphere a volume - filling magnetic field of 100  g inclined by @xmath7 with respect to the line of sight ( los ) produces in both ly@xmath0 lines circular polarization @xmath8 signals significantly smaller than 0.1% , while the contribution of the transverse zeeman effect to their linear polarization is insignificant ) .",
    "the conclusions of @xcite were obtained through detailed radiative transfer ( rt ) calculations in semi - empirical and hydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere , applying the quantum theory of polarization described in the monograph by @xcite .",
    "this density - matrix theory is based on the approximation of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) , which neglects correlations between the frequencies of the incoming and outgoing photons in the scattering events .",
    "in addition , @xcite neglected quantum interference between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 upper levels of such ly@xmath0 lines",
    ". both approximations should be suitable for estimating the linear polarization amplitudes at the line center , which is where the hanle effect operates",
    ". however , in strong resonance lines the joint action of partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) and @xmath1-state interference can produce important observational signatures in the wings of the fractional linear polarization ( @xmath2 ) profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the impact of prd and @xmath1-state interference effects on the scattering polarization of the ly@xmath0 lines of h  i and he  ii . to this end",
    ", we apply the same theoretical framework and rt code that @xcite developed for investigating the scattering polarization pattern across the @xmath11 and @xmath12 lines of mg  ii . like the mg  ii @xmath11 and @xmath12 lines ,",
    "also the above - mentioned ly@xmath0 lines result from two transitions between a common lower level with angular momentum @xmath13 and two upper levels with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , in contrast with the case of the mg  ii resonance lines , the two components of each ly@xmath0 line are fully blended since the fine - structure splitting between the two upper @xmath1-levels is much smaller than the doppler line width .- levels , though small , is in any case much larger than the levels natural width . ]",
    "this investigation has been carried out within the same theoretical framework that has been recently developed by @xcite for investigating the polarization properties of the mg  ii @xmath11 and @xmath12 lines .",
    "the reader is referred to that paper for more details on the theoretical tools that we have applied .",
    "we consider a _ two - term _ atomic model both for h  i and he  ii , the lower term being composed of the ground level ( @xmath15 ) and the upper term of the upper levels ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) . such atomic model allows us to take into account the fine structure of the ly@xmath16 line , as well as the contribution of the @xmath1-state interference between the two upper @xmath1-levels .",
    "the non - lte rt problem is formulated within the redistribution matrix formalism .",
    "we consider a linear combination of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 redistribution matrices ( which describe purely coherent scattering and completely redistributed scattering in the atom rest frame , respectively ) , for a two - term atom with unpolarized and infinitely sharp lower term , in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "the redistribution matrix @xmath17 in the observer frame is calculated starting from the expression derived by @xcite in the atom rest frame , and taking doppler redistribution into account ( see eq .",
    "( 3 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "the redistribution matrix @xmath18 is calculated in the limit of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) in the observer frame , starting from the crd theory for a two - term atom presented in @xcite .",
    "the effect of inelastic and superelastic collisions is included under the same approximations made in @xcite .",
    "the collisional rates for the h  i ly@xmath16 line have been calculated form @xcite , those for the he  ii ly@xmath16 line from @xcite .",
    "we consider the branching ratios for @xmath17 and @xmath18 derived for the two - level atom case ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . neglecting depolarizing collisions , such branching ratios are given by @xmath0 and @xmath19 , respectively , with and @xmath19 , defined according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , do not include the factor @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the photon destruction probability .",
    "this factor is directly included in the redistribution matrices . ]",
    "@xmath22 the quantities @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the broadening widths of the upper level due to radiative decays , superelastic collisions , and elastic collisions , respectively .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 as a function of height for the two lines under investigation , in the semi - empirical solar atmosphere model c of @xcite ( hereafter , fal - c ) , is shown in the left panel of fig .  1 . as pointed out in @xcite , and as it can be seen from the right panel of fig .",
    "1 , the he  ii ly@xmath0 line forms in a thin layer of the transition region ( approximately , between about 2000 and 2200  km ) . as shown in the left panel of fig .  1",
    ", at these heights @xmath0 is essentially equal to unity so that the assumption of purely coherent scattering in the atom rest frame is an excellent approximation for the modeling of this line .",
    "the situation is slightly different as far as the h  i ly@xmath16 line is concerned .",
    "while the core of this line forms in the transition region , just a few kilometers below the core of the he  ii ly@xmath0 line , its broad wings form deeper in the chromosphere , where @xmath0 assumes values appreciably smaller than one , though larger than 0.9 .",
    "the approximation of purely coherent scattering in the atom rest frame is thus not so good for this line , and its modeling requires to take both @xmath17 and @xmath18 into account .",
    "the polarization profiles of the two lines under investigation are calculated by applying a non - lte rt code based on the angle - averaged expressions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and including the contribution of an unpolarized continuum .",
    "the numerical method of solution is a direct generalization to the prd case of the jacobian iterative scheme presented in @xcite .",
    "the initialization of the iterative calculation is done using the self - consistent solution of the corresponding unpolarized problem , obtained by applying uitenbroek s ( 2001 ) rt code .",
    "the same code is used to calculate the continuum opacity ( including the uv line haze ) and emissivity .",
    "we point out that due to the negligible impact of @xmath1-state interference on stokes-@xmath26 , the prd intensity @xmath27 profiles obtained with our code coincide with those computed using uitenbroek s ( 2001 ) code ( which neglects @xmath1-state interference ) . as we shall see below , @xmath1-state interference effects , together with those caused by prd , have however an important impact on the @xmath2 profiles .",
    "figure  2 shows the prd @xmath2 profiles of the h  i ly@xmath0 line , obtained by taking into account and neglecting quantum interference between the two upper @xmath1-levels .",
    "the calculations have been performed in the fal - c atmospheric model , for a line - of - sight ( los ) with @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 the heliocentric angle ) .",
    "the two profiles perfectly coincide in the core of the line where @xmath1-state interference does not produce any observable signature ( cf .",
    "* ) . in this spectral region",
    ", our prd profile shows a good agreement with the corresponding crd profile calculated by @xcite ( see the left panel of their fig .  2 ) .",
    "outside the line core , prd effects produce a complex linear polarization profile with extended wings , while @xmath1-state interference plays a significant role , producing much larger polarization amplitudes with respect to the case in which it is neglected . the profile obtained by taking @xmath1-state interference into account shows in particular two narrow negative peaks at approximately @xmath30   from line center , with an amplitude of about -7% , and two broad negative lobes with a minimum of about -6% at approximately @xmath31   from line center . as seen in fig .  3",
    ", the shape of the @xmath2 profile remains qualitatively the same for line of sights corresponding to larger @xmath32 values , although the @xmath2 amplitudes are clearly smaller .",
    "figure  4 shows the sensitivity of the scattering polarization profile of the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line to the thermal structure of the model atmosphere .",
    "we compare the results for the atmospheric models c , f and p of @xcite , which can be considered as illustrative of quiet , network and plage regions .",
    "such sensitivity is due to the fact that the anisotropy of the incident radiation field ( which induces atomic level polarization in the @xmath10 level and quantum interference between its sublevels and those of the @xmath9 level ) depends on the gradient of the stokes-@xmath26 component of the source function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "notice that especially the wing @xmath2 signals , which are insensitive to the magnetic field ( since the hanle effect operates only in the line core ) , are very sensitive to the temperature structure of the model atmosphere .",
    "therefore , in addition to the @xmath27 profile itself , the wings of the @xmath2 profile could help us to constrain the thermal properties of the observed atmospheric region , and this would in turn facilitate the modeling of the line - core signals and the inference of the magnetic field .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "5 shows our prd results for the @xmath2 profile of the ly@xmath0 line of he  ii calculated in the fal - c atmospheric model , taking into account ( solid line ) and neglecting ( dashed line ) the impact of @xmath1-state interference .",
    "the line - core polarization , and its modification by the hanle effect , can be safely modeled in the crd limit , and neglecting @xmath1-state interference . however , as soon as we go outside the line - core region , the combined action of prd and @xmath1-state interference effects produces strong @xmath2 signals , which are not obtained when such physical ingredients are neglected .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "3 shows the center to limb variation of the @xmath2 profile .    finally , in the right panel of fig .",
    "5 we provide information on the sensitivity of the @xmath2 profile to the thermal structure of the atmospheric model .",
    "as can be seen , the wings of the @xmath2 signals are very sensitive to the model s temperature structure , while the line - core signals are practically identical in the three atmospheric models .",
    "the impact of @xmath1-state interference on the @xmath2 profiles of various multiplets was first demonstrated and explained in @xcite and considered in greater detail in @xcite , landi deglinnocenti & landolfi ( 2004 ) , and @xcite .",
    "the results presented in the previous sections show that in the wings of the lines , the amplitude of the @xmath2 profiles is about a factor 3 larger when the effects of @xmath1-state interference are taken into account ( see figs .  2 and 5 ) .",
    "in order to understand this behavior , we first note that far away from its `` center of gravity '' , a multiplet ( in which the contribution of interference between different @xmath1-levels is taken into account ) behaves in resonance scattering as a two - level atom transition with @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also observe that at these frequencies scattering is purely coherent in the observer frame .",
    "starting from the expressions of the emission coefficients given in @xcite , it can be shown that , far from the center of gravity of the multiplet , the fractional polarization of the radiation scattered at @xmath35 is given by @xmath36_{\\rm int . }",

    ", it can be shown that for a multiplet having a single @xmath1-level in the lower term , far from its center of gravity , the fractional polarization obtained taking into account the contribution of the various lines , but neglecting interference , is given by @xmath36_{\\rm no \\ ; int . }",

    "having @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we then have @xmath47_{\\rm int.}}{\\left [ p_q(\\nu )       \\right]_{\\rm no \\ , int . } } =       \\frac{w_2(1,0)}{{\\mathcal s}_{1/2 } \\ ,",

    "= 3 $ ] , in agreement with the numerical results shown in this letter .",
    "as shown in this letter , the joint action of prd and @xmath1-state interference effects produce complex scattering polarization @xmath2 profiles in the ly@xmath0 lines of h  i and he  ii , with large polarization amplitudes in the wings .",
    "prd effects determine the qualitative shape of the @xmath2 profiles , while @xmath1-state interference plays a key role in producing the large polarization amplitudes in the wings of the lines .",
    "such wing polarization signals turn out to be very sensitive to the temperature structure of the atmospheric model .",
    "they could thus be exploited , in addition to the intensity profile itself , to constrain the thermal properties of the solar chromosphere .    as expected , the crd approximation is only suitable for estimating the line - core signals .",
    "for instance , for a los with @xmath54 the line - center @xmath2 signal of the he  ii 304    line calculated with prd and @xmath1-state interference in the fal - c atmospheric model is about @xmath55 , while it is about a factor three smaller for the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line .",
    "these line - center @xmath2 amplitudes are in good agreement with those obtained by @xcite , who assumed crd and neglected @xmath1-state interference effects for investigating the impact of the hanle effect on the linear polarization produced by scattering processes in the core of such ly@xmath0 lines .    finally , it is of interest to estimate how large are the linear polarization amplitudes that result from the wavelength - integrated stokes profiles ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "it turns out that for the he  ii line @xmath57 is similar to the line - center amplitude ( e.g. , for a los with @xmath54 we have @xmath58 in the fal - c model ) , while for the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line @xmath59 is much larger than the line - center amplitude ( e.g. , for a los with @xmath54 we have @xmath60 in the fal - c model ) .",
    "narrow band filter polarimetry ( e.g. , with a fwhm@xmath61 ) in these ly@xmath0 lines would provide interesting @xmath26 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 images over a large field of view .",
    "however , the information on the magnetic field of the solar transition region is encoded in the line - core polarization of the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line , which is where the hanle effect operates . for this reason , the chromospheric ly@xmath0 spectropolarimeter ( see *",
    "* ) aims at doing spectropolarimetry of the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line with a spectral resolution of 0.1    and a polarimetric sensitivity of 0.1% .",
    "since outside active regions the he  ii 304    line ( which originates entirely within the transition region ) is practically immune to the hanle effect , the possibility of having in addition the information provided by filter polarimetry in this reference line would facilitate the diagnostics of the thermal and magnetic structure of the solar transition region .",
