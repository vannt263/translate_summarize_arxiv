    "ion and photon beam irradiation are widely used to generate nanoscale surface features for a variety of applications : optoelectronic , plasmonic , magnetic , bio- and chemical sensing , and catalytic devices @xcite .",
    "understanding interfacial transport mechanisms under fast thermal processing or energetic beam irradiation is essential to accurately predicting the spatio - temporal dynamics of film evolution that imparts the desired nanoscale surface features .",
    "the contributions from various solid state transport processes that cause surface changes such as flattening or grooving in _ bulk materials _ were studied by mullins @xcite . in his formulation ,",
    "smoothening of bulk surfaces is driven by curvature effects that manifest in solid state surface diffusion , volume diffusion , or evaporation - condensation mechanisms@xcite .",
    "mullins theory has been widely accepted and used extensively in the analyses of surface processes @xcite . however , mullins theoretical framework is inadequate to describe solid state mass transport in _ ultrathin films _ in which one has to account for the effects of other driving forces on pattern formation , e.g. dispersion forces and epitaxial stress .",
    "for instance , it is well - established that epitaxial stress has a significant effect on surface diffusion .",
    "there is extensive literature on pattern formation in thin films in the presence of epitaxial stresses @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the literature on the evolution of ultrathin films on amorphous substrates , a scenario in which epitaxial stress effects are negligible , is sparse . in this article",
    ", we develop a generally applicable mathematical model for describing such processes and apply the model to study solid state transport in thin films exposed to time periodic laser thermal stimulus .",
    "recently , we have observed that thermal processing of ultrathin metal films by multiple instances of a @xmath5 pulsed laser ( with each pulse separated in time by @xmath6 ) results in a variety of spatially ordered patterns @xcite .",
    "one of the important findings , relating to the processing conditions , was that in order for pattern formation to occur , it was necessary to irradiate the films at a laser fluency at or above a critical value , which was well - correlated with the threshold energy required to melt the films @xcite . consequently , mass transport was considered to occur primarily in the liquid phase and pattern formation was attributed to a thin film hydrodynamic ( tfh ) dewetting instability , which arises in spinodally unstable films when attractive long - range intermolecular dispersion forces amplify surface perturbations @xcite .",
    "thermal modeling of the film / substrate bilayer showed that during one laser pulse , the film experienced a nearly uniform , but transient temperature field for a time scale of @xmath7 , of which the time to reach the melt temperature during the heating phase was @xmath8 , the liquid lifetime , @xmath9 was typically between @xmath10 and cooling time was @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "therefore , approximately @xmath12 of the thermal cycle following each laser pulse was spent in the cooling phase .",
    "this is important in the context of mullins analysis , which suggests that solid state diffusion and evaporation - condensation processes could influence surface deformation .",
    "hence , it is necessary to analyze both liquid and solid phase mass transport processes to develop a comprehensive understanding of the physics of interface evolution in thin films processed under pulsed laser irradiation .    in this work ,",
    "we have suitably modified mullins original formulation @xcite to describe the evolution of infinitesimally small surface perturbation of ultrathin solid films on amorphous substrates .",
    "in particular , we have derived new results for volume diffusion transport and have employed the approach adopted by spencer et al .",
    "@xcite originally for describing diffusion in epitaxially stressed films , in order to account for dispersion forces that are influential only in thin films .",
    "for pulsed laser experiments described in @xcite , we determined that there is negligible contribution to surface deformation from solid state material redistribution by evaluating solid state mass transport rates via diffusion and evaporation - condensation processes .",
    "these results suggest that film deformation occurring under each melting cycle in the liquid phase is essentially _ quenched - in _ during rapid resolidification .",
    "subsequent laser pulses cause progressively more interface deformation until the film ruptures .",
    "this mechanism is consistent with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "local curvature differences provide the driving force for mass rearrangement through various mechanisms in the solid state including surface diffusion , volume diffusion , and evaporation - condensation . in a series of papers",
    ", mullins outlined a theory to predict the mass transfer rates by the aforementioned processes for surface deformation of bulk materials @xcite . for thin films ,",
    "additional driving forces need to be accounted for , such as the free energy contributions from dispersion ( van der waals ) forces and thermal strain . for films supported by amorphous substrates ,",
    "epitaxial strain is irrelevant .",
    "however , mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients of the film and the substrate can result in thermoelastic strain . in this work ,",
    "we first develop the theory by incorporating dispersion forces , in the absence of thermal stresses .",
    "the effect of thermal stresses is only discussed qualitatively in sec .",

    "it has already been established that dispersion forces play a key role in the evolution of a thin metal film @xcite , especially upon laser - induced melting @xcite . by including the effect of the disjoining pressure to the free energy ,",

    "when the navier - stokes equations , describing mass transport in thin liquid films , are simplified via the lubrication approximation , a film - thickness dependent relationship between the material flow rate and pressure gradient can be derived @xcite .",
    "the pressure is a combination of the laplace pressure from capillarity and a disjoining pressure that arises from long - range dispersion or van der waals forces @xcite . when the disjoining pressure , which tends to amplify perturbations , exceeds the stabilizing effect of the surface tension , the film is in an unstable state and perturbations will grow , eventually causing the film to rupture . the thin film hydrodynamic equation describing this behavior is given by the following : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the dynamic viscosity .",

    "the film is at its melting temperature .",
    "the high temperatures suggest that solid state material transport mechanisms could be active . to estimate the relative magnitude of the effect that solid state mass transport could have on deformation of the film during the cooling period , we employed eqs .",

    "the stability of the solid film is strongly dependent on the choice of the hamaker coefficient @xmath26 , which dictates the magnitude of the disjoining pressure . when using the experimentally determined value of @xmath84 @xcite in eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmasolidstate ] , the film is unstable and there exists a characteristic wavelength that will grow the fastest . the dispersion curve for growth / decay rates of perturbations in the solid state has been shifted to larger wavelengths , as compared to that for the tfh instability , as shown in figure [ fig : codispersionplots](a ) . in this case",

    "are the same for both the solid and liquid states .",
    "the importance of the magnitude of the dispersion term on mass transport can be seen if one uses the lower limit of the hamaker coefficient for metals @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "when a theoretically estimated @xmath88 was employed , the disjoining pressure was not large enough to destabilize the solid film ; but rather , the film was seen to be stable against perturbations of all wavelengths . for a @xmath83 film ,",
    "the dispersion forces with @xmath84 are not large enough to instigate a dewetting instability in the solid film , as shown if figure [ fig : codispersionplots](b ) .",

    "there are several implications manifested in these results .",
    "first , the timescales of solid state process are much larger than the timescales associated with hydrodynamic flow .",
    "therefore , the _ quenched - in _ structures from the pulsed laser melting and resolidification are likely unchanged during the cooling period .",
    "this conclusion is corroborated by experimental observations of pattern formation in ultrathin metal films by using multiple pulses of ( @xmath91 wavelength , @xmath5 pulsed ) ultraviolet ( uv ) laser irradiation : see @xcite for details .",
    "a variety of metal thin films , including co , fe , cu , ag , ni and pt , were deposited under ultrahigh vacuum ( @xmath92 torr ) by e - beam evaporation or pulsed laser deposition onto commercially obtained sio@xmath93/si substrates with the thermally grown oxide layer of 400 nm thickness .",
    "film thicknesses ranged from @xmath94 nm .",
    "the initial films had an average surface roughness @xmath95 as evaluated by atomic force microscopy .",
    "following deposition , the films were irradiated at various laser energies above a threshold energy density @xmath96 such that appreciable surface deformation was observed for various irradiation times , as measured by the number of pulses @xmath97 ranging from @xmath98 .",
    "following such irradiation , the surface morphology and concentration of metal was evaluated by imaging and energy dispersive x - ray spectrometry in a scanning electron microscope , respectively .",
    "it was found that all the metals possessed a thickness - dependent threshold energy density @xmath96 above which substantial surface changes were observed .",
    "however , for energies below this threshold , no surface roughening was visible even after the longest irradiation times of 10,500 pulses .",
    "this energy threshold has been attributed to the energy required to melt the films @xcite . by irradiating films with a laser energy density above the melt threshold , we performed detailed studies of the dynamics of the pattern evolution for co films as a function @xmath97 and found that the dewetting patterns showed characteristic film - thickness dependent length scales and spatial order consistent with the predictions of eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmaliquid ] . hence , despite the much larger time spent in the solid phase ( i.e. cooling period ) , the overall contribution from solid state transport was inferred to be negligible .",
    "since we focus on the dynamics of perturbed thin films on amorphous substrates , the prevalent stresses that are present in the film are thermally generated . due to the mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficients between the film and the substrate ,",
    "the film is under compressive stress while it is heated and a tensile stress when it is cooling .",
    "this stress is given by the following expression : @xmath99}\\label{eq : thermalstress}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath19 is poisson s ratio , @xmath101 is young s modulus , @xmath102 is the thickness of the layer , @xmath103 is the temperature change , and the subscripts @xmath104 and @xmath105 denote the film and substrate quantities , respectively @xcite . in the limiting case where @xmath106 , the preceding expression reduces to : @xmath107 stresses related to thermal expansion for most thin metal films on a silica substrate are on the order of a few @xmath108 . however , they are still lower than the critical value required to initiate a buckling instability in the film , which is given by the following equation:@xmath109    where @xmath110 is a constant .",
    "typical critical stress values range from @xmath111 .",
    "stress can also result from an anisotropic temperature distribution in the film @xcite .",
    "this could arise in pulsed laser processing .",
    "as described above , the thickness variations caused by the tfh instability are quenched in during the rapid resolidification phase .",
    "hence , in the solidified deformed film , a non - uniform temperature profile could prevail for times comparable to the diffusion time scale @xcite . within the context of linear theory of elasticity",
    ", the thermoelastic stress will also decay at the same rate as the the temperature profile in the film @xcite .",
    "hence a characteristic time scale of temperature / stress diffusion can be estimated by solving the transient heat equation for a 2-dimensional film:@xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 are the density , heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the film , respectively .",
    "assuming an initial sinusoidal temperature profile in the lateral ( _ x _ ) direction and a uniform temperature distribution throughout the thickness ( _ z _ direction ) of the film , one finds the following relationship for the time dependent component of the temperature , @xmath116 , in which the temperature , @xmath117:@xmath118\\label{eq : tempprofile}\\ ] ] @xmath119 is the thermal diffusivity of the film , @xmath2 is the wavevector of the perturbation , @xmath120 is a constant between @xmath121 and @xmath122 and @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are the density , heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the substrate , respectively .",
    "since the length scale of the periodic thickness variations is being imprinted on the film in the liquid state , one can take the expected value of @xmath2 for a corresponding @xmath3 from tfh theory . using these values @xmath126 ,",
    "the timescale during which this stress could influence solid state mass transport is on the order of a picosecond for a perturbation wavelength , @xmath127 and on the order of a nanosecond for @xmath128 .",
    "these timescales are too short to appreciably effect any solid state process in modifying the surface of the film .",
    "we have developed a mathematical model to describe thin film dynamics on amorphous surfaces by incorporating the effects of surface / volume diffusion , evaporation - condensation and dispersion forces .",
    "new results are presented for volume diffusion in thin films .",
    "specifically , for @xmath129 < < 1 , the decay rate of surface perturbations by this mechanisms is proportional to @xmath130 as compared to @xmath60 for bulk materials .",
    "it is shown that depending on the magnitude of the hamaker coefficient , ultrathin solid films with thickness < 2 nm could be prone to pattern forming instabilities while films with thickness > 2 nm are predicted to be stable for a variety of metals .",
    "the model was applied to analyze the role of solid state mass transport mechanisms on the dynamics of thin films processed by pulsed laser irradiation .",
    "the upper limits for the time constants associated with the decay of surface perturbations in the solid state was found to be much smaller compared to the time interval between subsequent pulses .",
    "further , a qualitative analysis of thermoelastic stress dissipation in the film - substrate bilayer system showed that the time scale of stress relaxation is much smaller than the pulse duration .",
    "these findings suggest that contributions to the changes in surface deformation from solid state processes are minimal and the pattern formation occurs through a hydrodynamic instability that is followed by laser melting of the film , an observation corroborated by experimental observations .",
