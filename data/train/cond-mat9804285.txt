    "the basic features of this _ proximity effect _ were already well understood in the sixties .",
    "one of these properties is the diamagnetic screening of an applied magnetic field , which has been studied in a series of experimental@xcite and theoretical works@xcite .",
    "already early in this development it was recognized that the relevant length scale governing the superconducting correlations is given by the thermal and impurity dependent coherence lengths in the normal metal .",
    "the thermal length is given by @xmath0 in the clean limit ( mean free path @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 in the dirty limit ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the finite thickness @xmath4 of the normal - metal layer is an intrinsic geometric length scale of the proximity effect .",
    "the interplay between the three length scales @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath4 is relevant for the behavior of the microscopic quantities such as the spatial decay of the pair amplitude or the spectral density of states . in this paper",
    "we investigate the range between the clean and the dirty limiting cases and find several intermediate regimes of interest , differing by the relative magnitudes of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the theory of linear diamagnetic response of clean and dirty n - s proximity systems has already been studied extensively@xcite . while the dirty - limit theory was found to be in agreement with early experimental work @xcite",
    ", the samples studied in more recent experiments@xcite fail to be described satisfactorily by either the clean or the dirty limit .",
    "they exhibit the qualitatively different behavior of an intermediate regime . in a previous paper@xcite",
    "we were able to fit an experiment in the low - temperature regime with the dirty - limit theory .",
    "however , the data for temperatures @xmath7 could not be reproduced by the dirty limit theory .",
    "these experiments also show clear deviations from the clean - limit theory , even if the finite transparency of the interface is accounted for@xcite . on the other hand , the breakdown field seen in the nonlinear response to a magnetic field of some of the same samples",
    "was found to agree fairly well with the clean - limit theory@xcite . in this paper , guided by a numerical study",
    ", we classify the intermediate regimes and show how the qualitative discrepancies between theory and experiment can be resolved . in recent experiments on relatively clean samples",

    "we will not address this problem directly here , but rather provide an understanding of those facets of the proximity effect which are the necessary basis for further investigations .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "there is a major qualitative difference between the magnetic response in the dirty versus the clean limit . in the dirty limit",
    "the current - field relation is local and the screening can be almost complete .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the clean limit , where the current - field relation is completely nonlocal and the current depends on the vector potential integrated over the whole normal - metal layer @xcite . as a consequence",

    "the different curves are for the clean limit and for mean free paths @xmath195 .",
    "we see that a finite impurity concentration has strong influence on the screening fraction , even if @xmath196 .",
    "it can either increase or decrease the diamagnetic screening , depending on temperature .    for the interpretation of these results we first consider the case @xmath80 . the lower - right graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] shows that the screening is nearly local , since overscreening is rather small .",
    "the local screening strength depends on the local superfluid density . at low temperatures @xmath197",
    "the superfluid density at @xmath84 is finite and the field is screened exponentially , leading to a screening fraction of nearly unity .",
    "a higher temperature suppresses the superfluid density and the field penetrates to the point where the density is large enough to screen effectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the locality of the kernel allows the system to screen even if the superfluid density is suppressed nearly everywhere .",
    "the screening is then enhanced in comparison to the clean limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho1 ] this appears at @xmath198 .",
    "let us now consider a mean free path of order or much larger than the sample size .",
    "even for @xmath199 we see a deviation from the clean - limit expression at low temperatures . for @xmath200 and",

    "@xmath147 is similar to the clean limit screening fraction .",
    "a qualitative understanding may be gained from looking at the constitutive relation in the limit @xmath202 . in the limit",

    "we estimate this by calculating the two contributions to the current using the clean - limit vector potential ( [ aclean ] ) . comparing the two contributions",
    ", we find that impurities can be neglected , if @xmath205{\\lambda^2(t)l}\\gg d\\ ; .\\ ] ]    this equation defines a new length scale , the effective penetration depth @xmath206 , which determines the validity of the clean - limit magnetic response .",
    "for the clean limit to be valid at @xmath158 the condition @xmath207 has to be fulfilled , since in this case the screening takes place on the geometrical scale @xmath4 .",
    "in the case @xmath208 the field is screened on a scale @xmath206 and the screening fraction is strongly enhanced in comparison to the clean limit .",
    "nevertheless , the clean - limit behavior reappears at higher temperatures , since @xmath209 grows with temperature .    for @xmath159",
    "the deviations from the clean limit are related to deviations of the zeroth - order green s function from the clean - limit expression due to impurity scattering .",
    "the correction to @xmath15 , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : clean_corr_solu_for_g ] ) , leads to a finite superfluid density in the vicinity of the superconductor via the factor @xmath210 in the kernel .",
    "the range of the propagator is modified by the correction ( [ eq : clean_corr_solu_for_f ] ) to @xmath211 , leading to @xmath212 thus , the range of the kernel is now given by @xmath5 , which is strongly temperature dependent .",
    "summarizing , we find for the current @xmath213 again showing the importance of the new length scale @xmath206 . in the limit @xmath214 the field can not be effectively screened on the scale @xmath5 , leading to a vanishing screening fraction .",
    "if @xmath215 the field can be screened on a length scale smaller than @xmath5 and the screening fraction will be finite .",
    "it is therefore evident that the interplay between local and nonlocal physics is of crucial importance for the screening behavior of a normal - metal proximity layer .",
    "the most interesting regime occurs for @xmath196 , where a transition between different screening behaviors may be observed by varying the temperature , see fig .",
    "[ fig : regime ] .",
    "we note that the screening fraction is a non - monotonic function of the mean free path . at low temperature , with increasing mean free path ( i.e. increasing purity ) , the screening fraction is reduced rather than enhanced .",
    "assuming a temperature - dependent scattering mechanism with decreasing mean free path as a function of temperature , such as electron - electron or electron - phonon interaction , we might speculate to observe a non - monotonic ( i.e. re - entrant ) behavior of the susceptibility ( here the smallness of the scattering rate is compensated by the high sensibility of the non - local current - field relation ) .",
    "however , as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ defm ] ) , the largest off - diagonal self - energy ( @xmath153 ) which includes e.g. impurity scattering will provide a ( low - temperature ) cutoff for this behavior .",
    "finally we comment on the effect of a rough boundary .",
    "for @xmath159 the green s functions are independent of the boundary condition at @xmath84 . in this case",
    "finite _ screening fraction can only be due to impurity scattering , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rho1 ] . for @xmath216",
    "the screening behavior will be strongly affected by a rough boundary .",
    "this makes it possible to distinguish between clean samples with a rough boundary and samples containing impurities .",
    "we have investigated the diamagnetic response of a proximity layer for arbitrary impurity concentration using the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity .",
    "we found a variety of different regimes in which the physics is different from the previously studied clean and dirty limits .",
    "we have first investigated the proximity effect in the absence of fields , distinguishing three different regimes , see fig .  [",
    "fig : regime ] . in the ballistic regime ,",
    "the validity of the clean - limit solution is restricted to @xmath217 for @xmath218 and to @xmath202 for @xmath219 .",
    "the last condition is the consequence of the suppression of the density of states for @xmath220 , which enhances the effective mean free path to @xmath221 . in the diffusive regime",
    ", we found that the validity of the usadel equation ( dirty limit ) depends on the superconductor as well as the normal metal , and is thus restricted to @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "the first condition is due to the fact that the induced superconducting correlations are strongly anisotropic for a clean superconductor ( @xmath224 ) , even if the motion is diffusive in the normal metal .",
    "the intermediate diffusive regime ( @xmath225 ) is not covered by these two cases . here",
    "the full eilenberger equation has to be solved , which requires a numerical analysis , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fvxtau1 ] .    to study the magnetic response of the proximity layer we have derived explicit expressions for the general linear - response kernel ( [ kernel ] ) for an ns sandwich .",
    "this derivation may easily be generalized to systems such as josephson junctions or unconventional superconductors .",
    "we have used this linear - response kernel to study the magnetic response of the proximity system at arbitrary impurity concentrations . the nonlocal current - field relation is shown to have non - trivial consequences on the screening behavior of the normal metal . in the ballistic case",
    ", we found the clean - limit theory to be restricted further by @xmath226 , @xmath206 giving the penetration depth for the non - local current - field relation . if @xmath227 , the screening takes place on the geometric length scale @xmath4 , leading to a saturation at the screening fraction of @xmath9 at low temperatures . if @xmath228 , the finite ( even though large ) mean free path strongly enhances the screening .",
    "thus for typical samples with @xmath229 even a mean free path @xmath202 can not be neglected , i.e. , the clean - limit behavior is practically unobservable . at large temperatures @xmath159 ,",
    "a finite impurity concentration reduces the range of the linear - response kernel to @xmath5 , again enhancing the screening .",
    "furthermore , the screening fraction may serve to distinguish between samples with bulk impurities rather than a rough boundary , since a nonzero screening fraction at large temperatures is _ only _ due to bulk impurity scattering . in dirty systems , where the zeroth - order green s function is well described by the usadel approximation",
    ", the current - field relation can still be non - local .",
    "we have shown that the applicability of the local current - field relation is restricted to @xmath180 for @xmath230 and @xmath231 for @xmath185 .",
    "this shows that in the presence of magnetic fields some caution is needed in applying the usadel theory .",
