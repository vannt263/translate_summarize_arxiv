    "one of the milestones of the technological revolution that has occurred in the last @xmath3 years is the invention of the field effect transistor ( fet ) .",
    "as it is well known , the working principle of fet devices is based on the modulation of the transport properties of a material by means of an applied electric field .",
    "this is important not only from a technological point of view but also from a fundamental one . indeed , field - effect experiments allow tuning the charge density of a material without the side effects typical of chemical substitutions or application of pressure , such as introduction of disorder or modification of the lattice structure . in this regard",
    "field - effect experiments allowed , for instance , enhancing the critical temperature of some superconductors @xcite , inducing metallic behavior in insulators @xcite , or even a superconducting phase transition in materials like srtio@xmath4 @xcite , zrncl @xcite , and ktao@xmath4 @xcite . in order to achieve large effects ,",
    "a high amount of charge has to be injected and therefore very intense electric fields are required . instead of using the standard solid dielectric which is nowadays a very common solution for commercial devices , the use of a polymer electrolyte solution ( pes ) @xcite is a very promising technique to achieve these huge charge injections .",
    "with a solid - dielectric device it is possible to induce a surface charge @xmath5 of the order of @xmath6 charges/@xmath1 while with polymeric gating techniques this value can easily reach some units in @xmath7 charges/@xmath1 as a consequence of electric fields as high as @xmath8 mv / cm .",
    "the electrochemical gating technique is based on the formation of an electric double layer ( edl ) between an electrolyte solution and the surface of the sample under test : the polymer solvates positive and negative ions in the electrolyte solution and an external bias drives them towards the oppositely polarized surface of the film or gate , thus forming the edl .",
    "therefore , the edl acts as a parallel - plate capacitor with extremely small distance between the plates ( of the order of the polymer molecule size ) @xcite and thus a very large capacitance . +",
    "as already stated above , field - effect experiments have been performed in some exotic materials in order to induce dramatic modifications of their properties or even phase transitions @xcite . however , although poorly studied , field - effect measurements have been carried out also in metals .",
    "the little interest in this topic is mainly due to the fact that it seems not to be so much attractive from an applicative point of view , but also because the effect is commonly considered to be difficult , or almost impossible , to observe : indeed , the electronic screening length in the semiclassical model for a metal is less than one atomic radius .",
    "nevertheless , field - effect induced modulations of the conductivity in metals have already been observed in the past @xcite , also justifying a fundamental interest in this subject .",
    "+ here we report on field - effect experiments performed on gold , silver and copper by means of the electrochemical gating technique .",
    "the novel pes we adopted allows surface charge injections as high as and far - from - negligible modulations of the conductivity were observed in all the investigated metals . in particular , relative variations of the resistivity @xmath9 up to 8 % , 1.9% and 1.6 % were achieved at room temperature in gold , silver and copper , respectively .",
    "if films are not too thin , such as to avoid a dominant role of surface scattering , the trend of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the thickness of the film ) can be nicely explained within the free - electron model .",
    "moreover , the huge surface charge injections achieved make this technique promising for many other materials such as graphene , unconventional superconductors and 2d - like crystals .",
    "the film resistivity is measured in the standard four - probe configuration .",
    "( b ) cross - section sketch of the device : when v@xmath13 is applied , ions are accumulated at the interface with the metallic film and a charge with opposite sign is induced on its surface , forming an edl . ( c ) photograph of a typical device used in our field - effect experiments on metallic thin films . ]",
    "figure [ fig:1](a ) shows a sketch of the experimental setup .",
    "the device , fabricated in the planar configuration as in ref.@xcite , consists of the metallic thin film under study , the gate pad and the pes .",
    "thin films are obtained by physical vapor deposition ( pvd ) of the selected metal ( gold , silver or copper ) at a pressure @xmath14 mbar .",
    "voltage , current and gate pads were deposited on top of the film by evaporating gold , independently of the metal under study . as a substrate",
    ", we adopted        the metallic thin film behaves as the channel of a standard fet whose resistivity is measured with a standard four - probe configuration by inverting the current during each measurement or by using the ac technique .",
    "the pes acts as the dielectric and is therefore connected on one side to the metallic film and on the other side to the gate pad .",
    "a bias is applied to the gate by means of a source - measure unit that , at the same time , measures the electric current flowing through the pes .",
    "the pes we used was obtained by a reactive mixture of bisphenol a ethoxylate ( 15 eo / phenol ) dimethacrylate ( bema ; average mn : 1700 , aldrich ) , poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate ( pegma ; average mn : 475 , aldrich ) , and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ( litfsi ) in the presence of @xmath15 wt of a 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propanon free radical photoinitiator ( darocur 1173 , ciba specialty chemicals ) .",
    "the quantities of bema and pegma are in a 3:7 ratio , and the litfsi is the 10@xmath16 wt of the total compound .",
    "the pes was then polymerized by uv exposure using a medium vapor pressure hg uv lamp , with a radiation intensity on the surface of the sample of 30 mw/@xmath1 .",
    "all the above operations were performed in the controlled ar atmosphere of a dry glove box with o@xmath17 and h@xmath17o content @xmath18 ppm .    :",
    "the application of the gate voltage causes an accumulation of charge at the interface between the film and the pes , thus forming the edl . a symmetric amount of charge",
    "is induced at the gate pad , shown on the right hand - side of fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] ( c ) shows a photo of a real device used in these experiments .",
    "in this section we describe the measurements performed on the devices previously shown , as well as the models used to determine the injected surface charge and to quantify the effect of surface doping on the conductivity of the metallic thin films .",
    "the sequence of operations and measurements performed on a single device is summarized in figure [ fig:2 ] . at @xmath19",
    "a voltage is applied between the gate pad and the film . after a proper time ( of the order of several hundreds of seconds due to the rather slow dynamic of the pes ) this voltage is removed as shown in figure [ fig:2](a ) .",
    "a sharp peak in the gate current flowing through the pes appears immediately after the application of gate voltage , indicating the formation of the edl .",
    "this current decreases almost exponentially and after a few seconds it reaches a very small constant value .",
    "when the gate voltage is removed a similar peak appears with negative values of the current , indicating the disruption of the edl ( figure [ fig:2](b ) ) .",
    "the time integral of this gate current as function of time ( figure [ fig:2](c ) ) provides . finally , this dynamical formation and destruction of the edl with the consequent charge injection at the surface of the metallic thin film relative changes in the film resistance of the order of 10@xmath20 as shown in figure [ fig:2](d ) .",
    "as expected , the application of a positive bias to the gate induces a negative charge at the film surface ( see fig . [ fig:1](b ) ) giving rise to a reduction of the total resistance of the film . in order to explain the experimental results just described , it is first necessary to carefully determine the surface charge injected in the film by the polymer gating and then to calculate the effect of this charge on the transport properties of the whole film .",
    "both these topics are addressed in the following .    in field - effect experiments performed on very thin films of materials less conductive than metals",
    "a direct estimation of charge injection can be done by means of hall - effect measurement at the sample surface . in metallic thin films",
    "this is not possible as it would require huge magnetic fields because of the high intrinsic carrier density of the metal and the considerable thickness of the film ( here of the order of ) . in the absence of a direct method for estimating the total charge on the side of the film we must rely on the determination of the additional charge induced on the film surface through the quantification of the edl charge on the pes side .",
    "a rough integration of the current flowing through the pes would give an overestimation of the charge that forms the edl .",
    "in fact , determining the charge of the edl by integrating the gate current is not correct if electrochemical effects are present , as pointed out in ref .",
    "indeed , in the current vs time graph it is possible to observe a slowly vanishing current that always persists long after the application of the gate voltage ( see fig . [",
    "fig:2](b ) ) .",
    "this current is due to the flow of charges necessary to maintain the gradient of ion concentration when diffusion of electroreactants @xcite or tunneling effects through the edl @xcite take place . .",
    "a suitable method of electrochemistry used to evaluate _ only _ the charge that forms the edl ( which , in principle , corresponds to the charge injected in the metallic film ) , separating it from the charge related to other phenomena , is called double - step chronocoulometry @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the time dependence of the calculated charge @xmath21 shown in fig . [",
    "fig:2](c ) .",
    "this @xmath22 dependence can be analyzed both during the application and the removal of gate voltage , giving two complementary information about the charge in the edl .",
    "the shape of @xmath22 shows indeed that two phenomena occur on very different time scales : a rather fast edl charging / discharging ( that is expected to show an exponential time dependence ) and other effects of electrochemical nature that should give a @xmath23 dependence @xcite . by plotting @xmath24 as function of @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) it is very easy to determine the instant @xmath25 at which the @xmath23 behavior becomes dominant , i.e. when the exponential behavior has become negligible .",
    "we assume that the total charge injected in the film is @xmath26 .",
    "this definition is different from the one used in standard chronocoulometry , where the edl charge is obtained by the intercept of the linear fit of the @xmath24 vs @xmath23 dependence with the vertical axis .",
    "the physical reason is the following : standard chronocoulometry procedure implies that the starting of the current that generates the edl and that of the current due to electrochemical phenomena are concurrent and that the scale of time in which these currents develop is the same and very small . in the case of our viscous pes",
    "the diffusion of electroreactants is likely to be rather slow and , consequently , it is reasonable to expect that the current due to electrochemical phenomena starts with a certain delay and reaches its maximum value sometimes later compared to that which forms the edl .",
    "this is exactly the kind of approximation we adopted in assuming that @xmath27 .",
    "this double - step procedure has the advantage to return both the charge that builds up the edl during the application of gate voltage and the charge that comes from the dissolution of the edl , during the removal of gate voltage , allowing a consistency check between the measured values at two different moments .        in figure [ fig:3 ] four",
    "double - step chronocoulometry plots are presented for two different metallic films ( silver and gold ) and for two different gate voltages .",
    "each graph shows the charging ( thick solid line , bottom ) and the corresponding discharging ( thick solid line , top ) curve plotted with respect to the square root of time .",
    "the main features previously described are clearly visible : a rapid increase ( decrease ) of the charge is present in the first 15 - 40 seconds after the application ( removal ) of the gate voltage , corresponding mainly to the phase of formation ( destruction ) of the edl .",
    "subsequently the @xmath24 vs @xmath23 curves become linear with positive ( negative ) slope indicating that a phase dominated by the diffusion of electroreactants has been reached .",
    "the linear fits of the different curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] as red thin lines .",
    "the discharging curves ( vertical scale on the right ) are symmetrical with respect to the charging ones but , of course , start at high @xmath24 values : in this case the edl charge is evaluated as the difference between the initial @xmath24 at @xmath28 0 and the one reached when the curve becomes linear .",
    "finally the edl charges obtained during the charging phase ( @xmath29 in the plots ) and the discharging one ( @xmath30 in the plots ) are averaged to obtain a single value @xmath31 for every applied gate voltage .",
    "it turns out that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are very similar to each other as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( please note the different vertical scales ) and , of course , they increase at the increase of @xmath32 .",
    "let s now suppose that @xmath31 , measured by this modified version of double - step chronocoulometry , is the same charge ( with opposite sign ) @xmath33 induced at the surface of the metallic thin film .",
    "the induced surface charge density will thus be @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the surface of the film covered with the pes ( gated area ) and @xmath36 is the electronic charge .",
    "we must now focus on where the charge induced by the polymeric gating is distributed and how it affects the total resistivity of the film . since the charge that we induce on the metallic film is only ( in a first , rough approximation ) two - dimensional , we can describe the thin film as a parallel of a perturbed and an unperturbed 3d region , where the three - dimensional charge density of the perturbed region follows a density profile @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the axis normal to the interface and the density decays on a length scale defined by a parameter @xmath39 . both @xmath37 and @xmath39",
    "depend on the material but for metallic films and within a simplified semiclassical model , one can imagine that the whole injected charge is uniformly distributed in a surface layer of thickness @xmath40 so that @xmath41 .",
    "different choices are possible for @xmath39 : from the classical thomas - fermi screening length that in good metals is of the order of 0.5  to more complex expressions that take into account quantum - mechanical screening phenomena",
    ". often a simple rule of thumb is used that consists in assuming the thickness of one atomic layer for the region where the charge is perturbed by the field . however , for our purposes here , the exact calculation of this quantity is irrelevant . in fact",
    "it can be shown both by a simple classic approach and by a much more complex perturbative self - consistent quantum model based on the lindhard - hartree theory of the electronic screening @xcite that @xmath39 does not enter the final expression for the relative variation of the total film resistance .    the simple free - electron calculation of this relative variation @xmath9 , that is based on the parallel of the perturbed surface region and of the unperturbed bulk one and assumes a constant effective electron mass and relaxation time , gives    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the gate voltage , @xmath44 is the unperturbed 3d density of charge carriers , @xmath45 is the unperturbed resistance when @xmath46 and @xmath12 is the total thickness of the film .",
    "as function of the gate voltage @xmath43 for different devices made of different metals ( au , ag , cu ) . in the inset the dependence of @xmath11 on the sequence of application of @xmath43 is shown .",
    "for details see the text . ]",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the dependence of the injected surface charge density @xmath11 on @xmath43 determined by the modified double - step chronocoulometry in different materials and devices . for @xmath47 v @xmath11 depends almost linearly on @xmath43 and then it grows more than linearly for higher @xmath43 .",
    "the injected charge densities for positive and negative gate voltages are rather symmetric for @xmath47 v while for @xmath48 v the negative ones are smaller .",
    "it is interesting to notice that there are data of different metals ( au , ag ) and of different devices that are gathered around the same guide for the eyes evidently the large differences in the @xmath11 values measured at the same @xmath43 do not depend on the particular metal or on the specific device .",
    "to better understand the origin of this behaviour we analysed the sequence of @xmath43 applications in auglass2.2 .",
    "record @xmath11 values of the order of 4.5@xmath49 @xmath50 that at the beginning can be obtained with @xmath51 volt ( see main panel of fig . [ fig:4 ] ) after some use of the device would be reached only by applying much higher @xmath43 with the consequent risks of possible reactions between the electrolyte and the sample .",
    "on @xmath11 as obtained for films of different metals ( au , ag , cu ) with different thickness and on different substrates ( indicated in the legend ) .",
    "the straight lines are only guides to the eyes . ]    in figure [ fig:5 ] the results concerning the film resistance variations generated by the charge injection are shown . according to eq .",
    "[ eq : deltar ] the quantity @xmath52 should be a linear function of @xmath11 with a negative slope . as a matter of fact fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows that this is the case for the variety of films of different metals and devices studied here .",
    "however the data for gold ( full squares , triangles and diamonds ) and silver ( full circles ) lie on the same straight blue dashed line which has a higher slope than the green dash - dotted line that approximates the data for copper ( full pentagons ) .",
    "the explanation appears quite simple : in eq .",
    "[ eq : deltar ] the slope of the @xmath52 vs @xmath11 curve is inversely proportional to the volume carrier density @xmath44 of the metal .",
    "but in the framework of the free - electron model the @xmath44 values of au and ag are quite similar ( 5.90 and 5.86 in units of 10@xmath53 cm@xmath20 , respectively ) while @xmath44 for cu is @xmath55 cm@xmath20 . the higher bulk carrier density of copper can nicely explain the reduced slope of the @xmath52 behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "gold films with very low effective thickness ( for example 5 nm , as in the case shown by red squares in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) deviate from the linear behavior at @xmath11 greater than @xmath56 @xmath50 .",
    "this could be due to the increased role that scattering phenomena at the film surfaces have in ultrathin films . in these conditions",
    "a simple free - electron model that neglects the surface scattering may be no longer appropriate to represent the real physical situation . a reduction in the absolute value of @xmath57 for a given @xmath11 is indeed predicted by the already mentioned quantum perturbative model @xcite , when the probability of electron reflection at the surface is not negligible .",
    "the maximum absolute value of @xmath57 obtained up to now in our polymer - gating field - effect experiments at room temperature is of the order of 8% , 1.9% and 1.6% for au , ag and cu , respectively .",
    "low temperature experiments ( down to 4.2 k ) have shown that @xmath57 values up to 10% can be obtained in gold @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that .",
    "a proper modification of the classic double - step chronocoulometry method gives us a very versatile tool for the determination of the amount of surface charge induced in these experiments , even when the standard hall - effect technique can not be adopted as in the case of metallic thin films .",
    "the huge resistance shifts ( up to 8% ) observed at room temperature in thin films of different metals ( au , ag , cu ) reveal the power of this technique and , maybe , could suggest possible applications of these results .",
    "the linear dependence of the quantity @xmath52 on @xmath11 observed in our thin films is explained very well by a simple free - electron model with parallel resistive channels , that also accounts for the observed differences in the slope of the above dependence in metals with a different .",
    "the future application of this technique to conventional and unconventional superconductors , topological insulators and graphene @xcite or other 2d - like materials could lead to a large and defect - free modulation of their surface electronic properties with extraordinary consequences that now can only be imagined .",
