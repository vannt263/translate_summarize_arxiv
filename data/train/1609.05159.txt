    "complex plasmas are plasmas containing small solid particles , typically in the micrometer range , the so - called microparticles .",
    "these are dusty plasmas , which are specially prepared to study fundamental processes in the strong coupling regime on the most fundamental ( kinetic ) level through the observation of individual microparticles and their interactions  @xcite .",
    "many interesting phenomena can be studied starting from small two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) clusters  @xcite to larger 2d and 3d systems where collective effects play a dominant role  @xcite .    under laboratory conditions ,",
    "the microparticles are heavily affected by the force of gravity .",
    "gravity leads to the sedimentation of the particles and can be balanced either by a strong electric field in the sheath of a discharge or by the thermophoretic force due to a constant temperature gradient over the microparticle cloud . additionally , there exist weaker forces like the neutral and ion drag forces and the interparticle interaction , which nevertheless can play a very important role in the total force balance .    under microgravity conditions , e.g. onboard the international space station ( iss ) , gravity is negligible . therefore , the particles are pushed out of the strong electric field region close to the electrodes due to their negative charge",
    ". they can form large and more or less homogenous particle clouds in the bulk of the discharge  @xcite .",
    "under microgravity , weaker forces become important and define the motion and structure formation in complex plasmas .",
    "the experiments performed under microgravity conditions allowed the researchers to obtain large 3d dusty plasma formations consisting of more than million dust particles  @xcite . however , these formations are not fully isotropic .",
    "this is a consequence of the plasma anisotropy along the chamber axis connected with the configuration of electrodes .",
    "hence , a uniform distribution of dust particles in a dusty formation ( dust cloud ) can hardly be constructed .    the number density of dust particles",
    "is commonly estimated based on the interparticle distance in experimental 2d frames ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , for lack of information on the type of a crystalline lattice of the dust crystal ( in a strongly coupled particle system ) and on the angle between the lattice axes and the beam of a laser used for optical diagnostics , such estimation is very crude so that it can define the number density only on the order of magnitude . in  @xcite , a standard tomography approach is applied for the determination of 3d particle coordinates in the dust cloud but this approach is not discussed .",
    "the methods of 3d structure determination in complex plasmas were discussed in @xcite , in particular , the bond order parameter method @xcite used to define the phase state of a system under investigation @xcite .",
    "the objective of this work is development of an accurate , reliable , and efficient method of determination of the spatial dust particle density distribution in complex plasmas and investigation of this distribution in dust clouds under different discharge conditions .",
    "we use the sequences of video frames taken in experiments with the 3d depth scans .",
    "a specially designed procedure allows one to restore the 3d particle coordinates defined as the coordinates of the center of mass of a cluster formed by individual dots in 2d frames",
    ". then we find the local particle density using the voronoi tessellation  @xcite .",
    "we find that two regions can be distinguished in each dust cloud , namely , the region of enhanced density adjacent to the space free from the particles ( void ) , which we term the cusp , and the region of moderate variation of the density or the foot .",
    "we also find that the monotonic decrease of the density with the distance from the discharge center at the foot is replaced by an almost flat distribution with a shallow minimum in the foot center as the carrier gas pressure is increased .",
    "this is indicative of a change in the discharge structure .    for a foot , the theoretical interpretation of obtained results",
    "is provided by the ionization equation of state ( ieos ) @xcite .",
    "however , this ieos proves to be invalid for a cusp because the local quasineutrality condition implied in @xcite is violated in this region . to extend the ieos to a cusp we replace this condition by constancy of the dust acoustic waves velocity across the dust cloud proved in @xcite .",
    "thus , we arrive at the modified ieos valid for both regions . given the particle density , this equation allows one to predict the ion and electron densities , which can be measured in similar experiments with complex plasmas .",
    "using the `` dust invariant ''  @xcite we can provide a theoretical estimate based solely on the particle diameter and the electron temperature ( at least , an order - of - magnitude one ) for the particle density not only in the foot but also in the cusp region .",

    "experiments were performed in the pk-3 plus laboratory onboard the iss  @xcite .",
    "the heart of this laboratory is a parallel - plate radio - frequency ( rf ) discharge operating at a frequency of 13.56mhz , sketched in fig .",
    "the electrodes are circular plates with a diameter 6 cm made of aluminium .",
    "the distance between the electrodes is 3 cm .",
    "the electrodes are surrounded by a 1.5cm - wide ground shield including three microparticle dispensers on each side .",
    "the dispensers are magnetically driven pistons filled with monodisperse particles of various size and material  @xcite .",
    "the discharge can operate in argon , neon , or their mixture in a wide range of pressures , rf amplitudes , and rf powers .",
    "the working pressures are in the range between 5 and 255pa .",
    "complex plasmas are formed by injecting monodisperse micron - size particles into the discharge .",
    "all the particles reaching the confinement region are kept there and form a complex plasma cloud . to observe the particles in the cloud ,",
    "the optical detection system consisting of a laser illumination system and three video cameras ( there is also a fourth camera of the same type which is used to observe glow characteristics of the plasma ) is used .",
    "two diode lasers ( @xmath0 m ) are collimated by a system of several lenses producing a laser sheet perpendicular to the electrodes with different opening angles and focal points .",
    "three progressive ccd cameras detect the reflected light at @xmath1 .",

    "the third camera is the high resolution camera with a fov of about @xmath4mm^2^. it can be moved along the central axis in the vertical direction .",
    "the cameras and lasers are mounted on a horizontal translation stage allowing a depth scan through , and , therefore , 3d observation of complex plasma clouds .",
    "further details on the pk-3 plus project can be found in a comprehensive review  @xcite .",
    "the experiments described here are carried out in argon at different pressures @xmath5 and effective rf voltages @xmath6 between electrodes ( see table  [ t : exp_par ] ) .",
    "we use melamine - formaldehyde particles .",
    "they were spheres with diameters presented in table  [ t : exp_par ] .",
    "the experimental procedure is as follows : when the particles form a stationary cloud in the bulk plasma , scanning was implemented by simultaneously moving laser and cameras in the direction perpendicular to the field of view with the velocity  0.6mm / s .",
    "each scan takes  @xmath78s , resulting in the scanning depth of  @xmath74.8 mm .",
    "the positions of dust particles were obtained on the video images of high resolution camera .",
    "the high resolution camera observes a region  @xmath8mm^2^ slightly above the discharge center and give the possibility to recognize separate dust particles .",
    "the processing procedure to find 3d particle positions will be presented in appendix  [ s6 ] .",

    "one can clearly see the chains of particles that correspond to the layers in the upper part of fig .",
    "formation of the layers was noted in ref .",
    "these layers lie in the plane @xmath14 parallel to the electrode plane .",
    "apparently , the @xmath15-axis perpendicular to these planes corresponds to a direction of the discharge electrical field .",

    ", @xmath16 corresponds to an optimum of sufficiently great number of particles and , at the same time , sufficiently small variance of the resulting particle density . for the selected values of @xmath16 ,",
    "this variance was always greater than the change of @xmath11 due to the cloud inhomogeneity inside the sampling volume in the directions perpendicular to the @xmath15-axis .",
    "note that in figs .",
    "[ f11][f14 ] , reading of the @xmath15-axis is directed from the plasma camera center so that on the left - hand side of each graph , one can see a region free from the dust particles termed the void .",
    "a theoretical interpretation of the obtained data will be considered in the following section .",
    "this interpretation allows one to find a relation between the dust density obtained in the experiments with the densities of ions and electrons in plasma as well as to evaluate the densities of dust particles in different regions of the dust cloud .",
    "a dust particle in the cloud is subject to the following forces : the electric driving force arising from the ambipolar diffusion , the ion drag force due to the momentum transfer from streaming ions to the dust particles , the neutral drag force resulting from the collisions between moving particles and the gas molecules , and the force proportional to the gradient of the pressure of particle subsystem @xmath17 . if we adopt the fluid approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite then the fields of particle velocity @xmath18 and cloud density @xmath19 are solutions of the euler equation @xmath20 and the continuity equation @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the friction coefficient defining the neutral drag @xcite , @xmath23 is the accommodation coefficient corresponding to the diffuse scattering of ions against the particle surface , @xmath24 is the mass of a gas molecule , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the number density and thermal velocity of the gas molecules , respectively , @xmath27 is the temperature of a gas , @xmath28 is the particle radius , @xmath29 is its mass , @xmath30 is the particle material density ; @xmath31 is the electric field driving force acting on unit volume where @xmath32 is the dust particle charge in units of the electron charge , @xmath33 is the elementary electric charge , @xmath34 is the electric field strength , @xmath35 is the electron temperature , @xmath36 is the electron number density , and @xmath37 is the dimensionless potential of a dust particle ; @xmath38 is the ion drag force acting on unit volume where @xmath39 is the ion number density and @xmath40 is the ion mean free path with respect to the collisions against gas atoms ; and @xmath41 is the dust pressure @xcite , where @xmath42 ( in what follows , we will mark dimensionless quantities with an asterisk ) .",
    "the nature of the ion drag force is rather complicated ( e.g. , @xcite ) but the expression ( [ e400 ] ) we use is very simple .",
    "this expression is valid for a dense cloud where the coulomb potentials of neighboring particles overlap .",
    "it estimates the momentum transfer cross section as the cross section of a sphere with the radius equal to the characteristic screening length in the wigner  seitz cell , which is @xmath43 .",
    "although it does not distinguish between the collection and orbital parts of cross section , does not take into account the dependence of the cross section on the energy of an incident ion , effects of the debye screening , the particle ordering , the ion wake formation , etc , it does depend explicitly on the local particle number density .",
    "it is this peculiarity of ( [ e400 ] ) that makes it possible to account for the existence of a stationary 3d particle cloud in a gas discharge .",
    "note that the use of cross section for an isolated particle @xcite , which is obviously larger than ( [ e400 ] ) , can not explain the cloud formation because for all particles , the force balance is reached only at some surface .",
    "it is worth mentioning that formula ( [ e400 ] ) agrees well with experiment .",
    "the ion drag force acting on an individual particle was directly measured in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the particles of the radius @xmath44 used in this experiment ,",
    "our approach is valid , and the force per one particle @xmath45 calculated from ( [ e400 ] ) amounts to @xmath46 .",
    "this lies within the experimental error estimated in @xcite and is less than the force calculated using the cross section for an isolated dust particle .    for a stationary cloud",
    ", the neutral drag vanishes .",
    "the particle pressure force can be neglected in most cases provided that the condition @xmath47 is satisfied @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath48 is the velocity of daws propagation ( sound velocity )",
    ". a stationary state of the dust cloud implies the zero total force acting on each dust particle .",
    "therefore , for a stationary cloud , the electric driving force is compensated by the ion drag , @xmath49 .",
    "this force balance equation is reduced to @xcite @xmath50 it is completed by the equation defining the particle potential @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the ion temperature and mass , respectively , and @xmath55 is the electron mass , and by the local quasineutrality condition @xmath56 note that ( [ e9 ] ) implies the oml model @xcite , which does not include the ion collisions in the vicinity of the particles resulting in the particle charge reduction @xcite .",
    "however under the conditions of our experiment , this effect seems to be negligible .",
    "thus for @xmath57 ( sec .",
    "[ s6 ] ) , the charge decrease by 30% leads to the decrease in the ion and electron number densities on the same order of magnitude , which is knowingly less than the accuracy of the theory .",
    "in addition , this effect is ignorable for the havnes numbers greater than unity ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , which is also typical for our experiment .",
    "the resulting ieos for a dust cloud can be written in the form of a local relation between each pair of the following plasma ionization state parameters : the electron , ion , and particle number density , and the particle potential @xcite .",
    "for the variables @xmath39 and @xmath58 , the ieos is @xmath59 for @xmath11 and @xmath58 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "a simple relation between @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 follows from ( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ e11 ] ) , @xmath65    the daws in a stationary dust cloud can be treated on the basis of eqs .",

    "hence , a good estimate is provided at some point inside a dust cloud , e.g. , at the point where the condition @xmath73 is satisfied . at this point ,",
    "the particle potential @xmath74 is defined by the equation @xcite @xmath75 and then @xmath76    equations ( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ e11 ] ) imply the local quasineutrality of plasma , which takes place provided that the screening length is much smaller than the length scale of plasma state parameters variation . in our experiments , this is true for most part of the cloud , where the change of @xmath11 is insignificant . in what follows",
    ", we will term this part of the cloud the foot . at the same time , as the void boundary is approached , @xmath11 increases sharply in a relatively narrow region ( cusp ) , whose width is on the same order of magnitude as the largest screening length of this system , the electron debye length ( see sec .

    "however , we can replace the quasineutrality condition by another condition to find a local form of an extended ieos . according to the results of experimental determination of the sound velocity in argon @xcite and neon @xcite ,",
    "the latter is independent of the coordinate inside the dust cloud including the void boundary .",
    "also , no variation of the measured sound velocity within the experimental accuracy was revealed in all available experimental studies .",
    "note that ieos ( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ e11 ] ) lead to a sharp vanishing of the sound velocity in a close vicinity of the void , which is an obvious consequence of the quasineutrality violation not taken into account in ref .",

    "if we denote the corresponding transition dimensionless particle number density and potential by @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , then it follows from ( [ e111 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) that @xmath84 we use the experimentally determined @xmath85 to estimate the ion number density in the dust cloud on the basis of the ieos ( [ e16 ] ) and ( [ e17 ] ) .",

    "farther from the discharge center , the dependence @xmath94 is rather weak . in sec .",

    "note that for @xmath100 ( fig .",
    "[ f14 ] ) , the void boundary was not stationary but it was involved in the heartbeat instability  @xcite , which makes problematic the determination of particle coordinates due to elongation of the visible tracks of rapidly oscillating particles .",
    "thus , the particle density determined in this region is questionable .",
    "also , the theoretical estimations of sec .  [ s5 ] can not be applied for an unstable system .",

    "we perform this procedure to eliminate the constant component in all frames and to reduce the influence of the pixels on the matrix of video camera with the increased level of brightness .",
    "the voxels with the brightness above threshold @xmath118 are gathered in clusters . by definition",
    ", the voxel belongs to given cluster if it has at least one neighbor comprising the same cluster corresponding to the subscripts @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath116 that differ from the subscripts of this voxel no more than by some @xmath119 .",
    "the brightness threshold as well as the value of @xmath119 were chosen manually taking into account the best visual correspondence of the images of the particles in the frames and their centers determined on the basis of algorithm .",
    "parameters of data processing are listed in table  [ t : par_dat ] .    typically , the threshold was a little bit higher than the level of the background brightness and @xmath120 .",
    "3d coordinates of the particle are determined as coordinates of `` the center of mass '' of the cluster corresponding to this particle with due regard for the brightness of the voxels as a weight factor . in this work ,",
    "we form a block containing 3d coordinates of the dust particles in the region corresponding to the observation area of the high - resolution camera and to the scanning depth .    given the frequency of video exposure ( 50frames / s ) and the velocity of the platform movement ( 0.6mm / s ) during the scanning , it is possible to calculate the laser sheet displacement between two successive frames ( 12@xmath121 m ) .",
    "for the high resolution camera , the pixel size in the frame is equal to @xmath122 m . for the sake of convenience of subsequent analysis of the results ,",
    "we assume that the plasma camera center is the center of the coordinate system .",
    "the objective of this paper is a determination of the dust particles density distribution in the region accessible for the high - resolution camera . here , we perform data processing for the region of the dust cloud that is situated between the void boundary and the near electrode region .",
    "this region is characterized by the nonuniform distribution of the dust particles . to find the local density of dust particles we use 3d coordinates of the dust particles determined on the basis of the procedure discussed in appendix  [ s8 ] .",
    "we use these coordinates to construct the 3d voronoi diagram , which is constructed of a set of the voronoi cells  @xcite .",
    "[ f_voronoi ] illustrates a view of such set in space .",
    "we estimate the particle local density as the inverse volume of the 3d voronoi cell .",
    "such processing allows one to assign the volume of voronoi cell  @xmath123 and the corresponding local density @xmath124 to each dust particle with the coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath125 .",
    "this allows us to get more detailed information on the distribution of dust particles density in comparison with the commonly used number density @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the number of particles in the volume  @xmath128 . to compare two methods of obtaining dust density distribution we present in fig .",

    "[ f4 ] where the distribution of local particle density is shown .",
    "this example testifies that using the voronoi tessellation makes it possible to obtain more detailed information concerning the particle distribution .",
    "it should be noted that for the particles situated at the outer boundaries of the cloud , the voronoi cells are not closed ; therefore , it is impossible to determine the local density .",
    "moreover , in calculation of the voronoi cell volume , we have to exclude the cell tops that are beyond the limits of the region of the coordinate determination .",
    "hence , we do not include in the analysis the highly deformed cells , which can be encountered near the cloud boundary .",
