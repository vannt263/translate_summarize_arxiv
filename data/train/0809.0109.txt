    "for the understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , precise knowledge about the metal production from type ia ( sn ia ) and type ii ( sn ii ) supernovae ( sne ) is of vital importance .",
    "x - ray imaging spectroscopy of supernova remnants ( snrs ) , galaxies and intra - cluster medium ( icm ) has shown that metal abundances generally vary from source to source .",
    "however , @xcite determined the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , and fe in several galaxy clusters based on suzaku observations , and found that the abundance patterns are commonly represented by a combination of type ia and ii supernovae products with an occurrence number ratio of @xmath2 , based on the theoretical yields from sn ii and sn ia .",
    "in order to further look into the past history of the two types of supernova , we need more precise knowledge about the metal yields from the different sne types .",
    "it is , however , quite difficult to extract pure supernova products , in particular for the x - ray emitting hot gas .",
    "when we observe young supernova remnants ( snr ) , there is always a mixture of supernova ejecta and surrounding ism and line intensities also strongly depend on the ionization condition .",
    "one way to provide a good constraint is to observe x - ray halos around starburst galaxies , which are considered to be maintained by the enhanced sne ii activity in the recent time .",
    "recent x - ray observations of starforming galaxies showed that metals are contained in the extended hot halo of the galaxies .",
    "for m82 and ngc 253 , rgs spectra for several sliced regions along the outflow axis showed lines from highly ionized o , ne , mg , si and fe @xcite . the observed intensity ratios of the lines indicates that the gas is cooling as it travels outward from the galaxy disk and that the gas around ngc 253 could be partly out of ionization equilibrium .",
    "suzaku observations of a `` cap '' region of m82 , which is 11.6 kpc north of the galaxy and is possibly a termination region of the hot - gas outflow , showed a spectrum consisting of emission lines from o through fe @xcite .",
    "these spectral features strongly suggest that fresh metal - rich gas produced in the starforming region is flowing out mainly along the minor axis of galaxies . however , metal abundances in the halo gas has so far not been well - constrained .",
    "rgs data are limited in statistics , and both the epic and the acis instruments do not have sufficient energy resolution below 1 kev ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "suzaku offers a good opportunity for measuring the metallicity of the outflowing hot gas .",
    "ngc  4631 is a nearby sc / sbd galaxy with an edge - on morphology with the distance estimated to be about 7.5 mpc , where @xmath3 corresponds to 2.2  kpc .",
    "estimated mass by the tully - fisher relation is @xmath4 @xcite . the inclination and position angle are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "this galaxy is suitable for suzaku observations of the x - ray halo maintained by its sn activity . with its radio halo @xcite and warm ir ratio ,",
    "it is classified as a mild disk - wide starburst galaxy @xcite .",
    "an extended x - ray halo was discovered by rosat @xcite , and it has been well studied with chandra @xcite and xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "the size of the halo is several arcmin and no x - ray counterpart for the central agn has been detected @xcite .",
    "the association of an h@xmath7 filament with the x - ray emission has been discovered @xcite , and fuse also detected o lines from a region at @xmath8 above the disk @xcite .",
    "these strongly suggest that a halo around ngc 4631 is the site of galactic outflow or fountain , where the gas is floating up from the disk by the sn energy input and possibly cooling .    another important feature of the halo is the extended synchrotron radio emission , which is observed from several star - forming galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these radio halos are populated with relativistic electrons together with magnetic fields of an order of @xmath9 g .",
    "the radial orientation of the magnetic field lines suggests that the field has been carried into the halo region by the outflow of hot gas @xcite .",
    "in some cases , the hot gas may be confined in the halo when the magnetic pressure exceeds the thermal pressure @xcite . to constrain how",
    "the non - thermal energy is distributed in the halo , it is important to look into the possibility of non - thermal emission in the hard x - ray band .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the galactic hydrogen column density of @xmath10 @xmath11 @xcite in the direction of ngc  4631 .",
    "the solar abundance table is given by @xcite , and the errors are the 90% confidence limits for a single interesting parameter .",
    "suzaku carried out observations of the starburst galaxy ngc  4631 in november 2006 ( pi : n. y. yamasaki ) with an exposure of 81 ks .",
    "the observation log is given in table  [ tab : log ] .",

    "<S> suzaku observation of the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 4631 confirmed its x - ray halo extending out to about 10 kpc from the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> the xis spectra yielded the temperature and metal abundance for the disk and the halo regions . the observed abundance pattern for o , ne , mg , si and fe is consistent with the metal yield from type ii supernovae , with an o mass of about @xmath0 contained in the halo . </S>",
    "<S> these features imply that metal - rich gas produced by type ii supernova is brought into the halo region very effectively , most likely through a galactic wind . </S>",
    "<S> temperature and metal abundance may be affected by charge exchange and dust . </S>",
    "<S> an upper limit for the hard x - ray flux was obtained , corresponding to a magnetic field higher than @xmath1 g . </S>"
