    "this parameter gives the equilibrium value of clc twist wavenumber , @xmath6 , which corresponds to the pitch @xmath7 . in",
    "what follows the parameter @xmath8 will be referred to as the free twist wavenumber or the free twisting number .",
    "so , if the twist axis coincides with the @xmath9-direction , the director field @xmath10 defines the equilibrium configuration .",
    "since @xmath11 and @xmath12 are equivalent in liquid crystals , periodicity of the spiral is given by the half - pitch , @xmath13 .",

    "the macroscopic chiral parameter @xmath5 ( and thus the pitch ) is determined by microscopic intermolecular torques  @xcite and depends on the molecular chirality of clc consistuent mesogenes . in experiments",
    "it can be influenced either by variations in thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or by introducing impurities .",
    "so far we have seen that the twisting number of the ideal helical director configuration in unbounded clcs equals the free twisting number @xmath8 .",

    "the case of planar clc cell bounded by two parallel substrates exemplifies the simplest confining geometry and is of our primary concern in this paper .",
    "director configurations in the clc cell are strongly affected by the anchoring conditions at the substrates , so that , in general , the helical form of the director field will be distorted .",
    "nevertheless , when the anchoring conditions are planar and out - of - plane deviations of the director can be neglected , the configurations still have the form of the helical structure which twist wavenumber , @xmath15 , differs from @xmath8 .",

    "the result is that the stronger the anchoring , the larger the change of the half - turn number ( and of the twist wavenumber ) needed to reach the equilibrium state .",
