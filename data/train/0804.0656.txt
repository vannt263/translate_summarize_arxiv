    "as the members of the nonet of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons , the @xmath13 and @xmath0 mesons have been the subject of considerable interest since accurate and complete measurements have been performed at the experimental facilities of cosy , mami , disto , graal , celsius and saturne in the past few years .",
    "their intrinsic structure and properties , as well as the production mechanism in elementary particle and hadron physics , are intensively explored .",
    "the physically observed @xmath13 and @xmath0 mesons are mixtures of the pseudoscalar octet and singlet , which results in a considerable amount of @xmath14 in both and accounts for the difference in @xmath13 mass from the pion .",
    "the much greater mass of @xmath0 meson is thought to be induced by the non - perturbative gluon dynamics@xcite and the axial anomaly@xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath0 production in nucleon - nucleon collisions strengthen our understanding on those problems and also provide assistant opportunities to study the possible nucleon resonances @xmath15 that couple only weakly to pion . due to the precise measurements of the total cross section of the @xmath16 reaction@xcite",
    ", a number of studies@xcite have concluded that @xmath13 meson is dominantly produced through the excitation and de - excitation of the @xmath2 resonance in this reaction , though the excitation mechanism is still under debate .",
    "the first measurement of the cross section of the quasi - free @xmath17 reaction@xcite shows about a factor of 6.5 larger than that of @xmath18 , clearly indicating a dominance of isovector exchange . a recent experimental study of the analyzing power of the @xmath19 reaction@xcite support that the @xmath5 meson exchange between the colliding nucleons is predominant . on the other hand , for the lack of experimentally established baryonic resonances which would decay into @xmath0 ,",
    "our understanding of the @xmath0 production is still much poorer and unsatisfactory , and there are only a limited number of studies both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "an early analysis based on the covariant one boson exchange(obe ) model@xcite reproduces the near - threshold total cross section of the @xmath20 reaction without any resonant term .",
    "however , a relativistic meson exchange model@xcite demonstrates that the existing data could be explained either by mesonic and nucleonic currents or by a dominance of two missing resonances @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the extended study@xcite motivated by the updated data of the @xmath23@xcite and @xmath24@xcite yields resonances @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and it is premature to identify these states , as these authors pointed out . besides , another complication comes from the gluon - induced contact term@xcite , which would have extra contribution to the cross - section for @xmath20 , since it is possible that @xmath0 meson couples strongly to gluons .",
    "recently , high - precision data of the reaction @xmath27 for photon energies from 1.527gev to 2.227gev are obtained by the clas collaboration@xcite , and the analysis@xcite of these data suggest for the first time that both the @xmath2 and @xmath28 resonances , known to couple strongly to the @xmath29 channel , couple to the @xmath9 channel .",
    "this is obviously the evidence for the important role of these resonances in the @xmath0 production .",
    "theoretically , @xmath2 is found to be important for the near - threshold @xmath30 and @xmath31 production in nucleon - nucleon collisions@xcite , and a significant coupling of @xmath2 to strange particles is indicated .",
    "furthermore , the properties of @xmath2 resonance are extensively discussed in chiral unitary approach@xcite , and large couplings to @xmath29 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are also illustrated .    motivated by these research , in this paper we assume that the excitation and de - excitation of the @xmath2 resonance play a major role in the @xmath0 production in the near - threshold region , and perform a consistent analysis to the reactions @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the framework of an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "because the coupling strength of @xmath0 meson to the nucleon and @xmath15 are poorly known@xcite , in our analysis we do not include @xmath37 and @xmath28 , which are expected to have very small contribution to the considered energy region@xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the nucleonic and mesonic currents in the intermediate state is found to make negligible difference in the final results@xcite , so we do not consider them either .",
    "we treat the reactions @xmath38 and @xmath36 at the relativistic tree level in an effective lagrangian approach , as depicted by feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "mesons exchanged are restricted to those observed in the decay channels of the adopted resonances , and most values of the coupling constants are fixed by the experimental decay ratios . as a result , the only adjustable parameters are cut - off parameters in the form factors .",
    "all interference terms between different amplitudes are neglected because the relative phases of these amplitudes are not known .",
    "the relevant meson - nucleon - nucleon(mnn ) and meson - nucleon - resonance(mnr ) effective lagrangians for evaluating the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "1 are@xcite : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath49 is undetermined nowadays , and the value of @xmath50 used in literature is ranging from 0.25 to 7@xcite .",
    "recent calculations@xcite seem to favor small @xmath49 , and @xmath50 = 0.4@xcite are used in our calculation .",
    "the partial decay width of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 then can be calculated by above lagrangians , and the coupling constants @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are determined through the empirical branching ratios@xcite , as summarized in table i. up to now , we have no information on the coupling constant of the @xmath57 vertex , and we determine it from a combined analysis of @xmath20 and @xmath12 reactions .    in order to dampen out high values of the exchanged momentum",
    ", the resulting vertexes are multiplied by off - shell form factors . in @xmath58 reactions ,",
    "the form factors used in the bonn model@xcite are taken : @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 being the cut - off parameter , four - momentum and mass of the exchanged meson .",
    "the commonly used @xmath63 for @xmath64 vertex , and @xmath65 for other vertexes , are employed .",
    "the cut - off parameters @xmath66 = 1.05gev for @xmath67 , @xmath68 = 0.92gev for @xmath64 , @xmath69 = 2.00gev for @xmath70 and @xmath71 = 0.80gev for mnr vertexes are adopted from ref.@xcite , which performed a systematic consistent investigation of the strangeness production process in nucleon - nucleon collisions . in @xmath72 reactions ,",
    "the following form factors for @xmath2 resonance are used@xcite : @xmath73 with the cut - off parameter @xmath30 = 2gev .",
    "propagators of @xmath5(@xmath13 ) , @xmath74 and @xmath2 are : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77    with above formalism , the invariant amplitude can be obtained straightforwardly by applying the feynman rules to fig . 1 .",
    "it is generally agreed that @xmath78 proton - proton final state interaction ( fsi ) influences the near - threshold behavior significantly in @xmath79 . in present calculation , watson - migdal factorization@xcite",
    "are used and the pp fsi enhancement factor is taken to be jost function@xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the internal momentum of @xmath82 subsystem .",
    "the related scattering length and effective range are : @xmath83 with @xmath84 = -7.82fm and @xmath85 = 2.79fm(i.e .",
    "@xmath86 = -20.5mev and @xmath87 = 166.7mev ) for @xmath78 @xmath82 interaction .",
    "then the total cross section can be calculated by above prescription , and the integration over the phase space can be performed by monte carlo program . as to the @xmath88 reaction ,",
    "isospin factors are considered@xcite , and @xmath84 = -23.76fm and @xmath85 = 2.75fm(i.e .",
    "@xmath86 = -7.87mev and @xmath87 = 151.4mev ) for @xmath78 @xmath89 interaction , @xmath84 = 5.424fm and @xmath85 = 1.759fm(i.e .",
    "@xmath86 = 45.7mev and @xmath87 = 178.7mev ) for @xmath90 @xmath89 interaction are used .",
    "we first apply our approach to the @xmath13 production , and check the applicability of our model .",
    "total cross section for @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are shown in fig . 2 , and our numerical results agree well with the experimental data .",
    "contributions of various meson exchanges to @xmath18 and @xmath94 are also shown , and @xmath5 exchange is found to make dominant contribution in the near - threshold region .",
    "this has received support from recent experiment@xcite , and also the reason for our simultaneous reproduce to these two channels@xcite .",
    "in sharp contrast to ref.@xcite which indicates @xmath74 exchange dominance , the contribution of @xmath74 exchange is much smaller than that of @xmath5 and @xmath13 exchange in our calculation .",
    "besides , in a calculation@xcite to @xmath95 reaction whose approach is similar to us , it is demonstrated that the contribution of @xmath74 exchange is larger than that of @xmath13 exchange though @xmath5 exchange is dominant in the @xmath2 excitation .",
    "this difference to our model is caused by the alternative cut - off parameters in the form factors , and much larger values(@xmath96 for @xmath64 vertex and @xmath97 for all other form factors ) are used in their model .",
    "it seems that the vector couplings of the @xmath64 vertex are suppressed more fast than the pseudo - scalar couplings of @xmath98 and @xmath70 vertex when the cut - off parameters are decreased . in the considered energy region ,",
    "the small cut - off parameters should be more reasonable , as already illustrated in the analysis to the strangeness production process in nucleon - nucleon collisions@xcite .",
    "similarly , our model should draw some analogous conclusions to the @xmath6 channel in this aspect due to the formalism of our model , as demonstrated below . the relatively larger @xmath13 exchange contribution than that of @xmath74 exchange",
    "is also found in refs.@xcite , but it is worth pointing out that a very small @xmath49 is adopted in our model .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "2(a)(c ) , there is no much room left to the coherent resonance - resonance interference term , which is thought to be non - negligible , as stressed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the cross section of @xmath99 where @xmath100 850mev is underestimated as displayed in fig .",
    "2(b ) , and this is obviously the evidence to the contribution of other resonances(i.e . @xmath37 and @xmath28 ) in this energy region .    for excess energies",
    "smaller than 20mev , theoretical results underestimate the empirical cross section of @xmath16 channel , as several authors pointed out@xcite .",
    "the discrepancy in invariant mass distribution is even more pronounced , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "3(a - d ) .",
    "in addition to a peak arising from the @xmath2 resonance and strong @xmath78 pp fsi , there is a surprising broad bump in both @xmath82 and @xmath101 invariant mass distribution , which is not trivial to be explained .",
    "some papers devote to this problem , and the origin of the bump is attributed to the large @xmath13 meson exchange contribution comparable with the leading @xmath5 meson exchange term@xcite or higher partial waves@xcite .",
    "however , former hypothesis apparently conflicts with the experimental finding of a dominance of isovector exchange , thus it can not account for the high ratio of @xmath102 to @xmath103 . the latter can not give simultaneous explanation of the excitation function and invariant mass distributions , and the visible bump at excess energies of 4.5mev@xcite is either improbably caused by the contribution of higher partial waves . as a result",
    ", it seems that this bump probably arises from the @xmath29 fsi@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , till now there is no rigorous treatment of three - pair fsi , and this problem needs further theoretical and experimental effort . as shown in fig .",
    "3(e - f ) , the angular distribution of @xmath13 meson in the @xmath18 reaction for excess energies of 15mev and 41mev are described well by our model , since our model is characterized by the @xmath5 exchange dominance process in the @xmath2 excitation .",
    "then we will employ our model to @xmath0 production since its success to @xmath13 production has been demonstrated above .",
    "total cross section for @xmath20 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are shown in fig .",
    "we get good reproduce to both @xmath20 and @xmath106 channels with @xmath107 = 1.1 , and some similar conclusions to @xmath13 production are achieved as expected .",
    "@xmath5 exchange is the largest contribution in the near - threshold region of @xmath6 , and @xmath74 exchange is much smaller than @xmath5 and @xmath13 exchange . without complexity caused by @xmath9 interaction@xcite ,",
    "our numerical results reproduce the experimental data quite well in the whole considered energy region . as can be seen in fig .",
    "4(c ) , we anticipate the same value of 6.5 for the ratio of @xmath7 to @xmath8 in our model , while this ratio will approach unity if @xmath0 is produced directly by gluons@xcite .",
    "so isospin dependence is powerful to distinguish different @xmath0 production mechanism , and may provide useful information to the possible gluon content of @xmath0 meson .    for the scarce and inaccurate data of @xmath12 , the extracted coupling constant @xmath108 has large err bar , and significant contributions from other @xmath15 resonances can not be definitely excluded .",
    "alternative combination of @xmath15 resonances and coupling strength would yield a good fit to present data@xcite .",
    "the dotted curve in fig .",
    "4(b ) shows that we can get a much better reproduce to the @xmath12 data with @xmath107 = 1.0 , although this will slightly underestimate the @xmath20 channel .",
    "an even better fit to the @xmath20 data can be achieved with @xmath107 = 1.15 , but this will overestimate the @xmath12 data as shown by the dashed line in fig 4(b ) .",
    "anyway , we get good result to both channels with @xmath109 = 1.1 , and our preliminary analysis should be reasonable considering that other @xmath15 resonances except @xmath2 show very weak couplings to @xmath9 .",
    "the calculated invariant mass spectrum of @xmath20 reaction at the excess energies of 15.5mev , 46.6mev and 143.8mev are presented in fig .",
    "our calculations of angular distribution of @xmath0 meson at 46.6mev and 143.8mev show obvious structure at forward and backward angles , and reproduce the experimental data nicely . however , it has to admitted that the measured angular dependence might be also compatible to isotropic shape within the given experimental uncertainties . besides , it is interesting to note that the data from ref.@xcite show distinct structure in the angular distribution of @xmath13 meson , but ref.@xcite gives a totally flat distribution , as can be seen in fig .",
    "3(e - f ) .",
    "so a detailed quantitative analysis awaits for the clearing of the experimental situation .",
    "the predicted differential cross section of @xmath24 at the excess energy of 15.5mev , together with the total cross section of @xmath105 , can be examined by the ongoing experimental studies@xcite .",
    "no obvious bump other than a peak arise in the invariant mass distribution because our model do not include additional mechanism rather than the @xmath2 resonance and fsi . if this is confirmed by the experiment , then other mechanism(probably the @xmath29 fsi ) accounting for the broad bump",
    "should be added to the study of the @xmath18 channel .",
    "in this paper , we present a consistent analysis to @xmath110 and @xmath12 within an effective lagrangian approach , assuming that @xmath2 resonance is dominant in the @xmath0 production .",
    "our numerical results show that @xmath5 exchange is the most important in @xmath6 reaction , and predict a large ratio of @xmath111 to @xmath8 .",
    "an explicit structure in angular distribution of @xmath0 meson is demonstrated . besides , a significant coupling strength of @xmath2 to @xmath112 is found : @xmath113 in a vector - meson - dominant model analysis to @xmath114 reaction@xcite , a value of @xmath115(i.e .",
    "@xmath116 ) is given , and this is coincident to our analysis .",
    "we would illustrate that this is also compatible to the mixture picture of @xmath13 and @xmath0 .    considering the possible gluonium admixture of the @xmath0 wave function , a basis of states @xmath117",
    ", @xmath118 and @xmath119 is adopted , and the physical @xmath120 and @xmath0 are assumed to be linear combinations of these basis of states@xcite : @xmath121 @xmath122 if the gluonium content of the @xmath13 meson is assumed to vanish(@xmath123 ) , all six parameters can be written in terms of two mixing angles , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which correspond to : @xmath126 @xmath127 if the gluonium content of the @xmath0 meson is further assumed to vanish(@xmath123 , i.e. @xmath128 ) , then @xmath124 is the @xmath129 mixing angle in absence of gluonium , and eqs.(16)(17 ) are the normal @xmath129 mixing in the quark - flavor basis . in the quark model , the @xmath0 couplings can be related to those of @xmath13@xcite : @xmath130 @xmath131 with @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 being the non - strangeness , strangeness and gluonium coupling constant . as to @xmath135 and @xmath49 , because the strangeness and gluonium content in nucleon are negligible , we can take the simplifying assumption @xmath136 and @xmath137 : @xmath138 with @xmath139@xcite .",
    "this is compatible to @xmath140 with recently extracted value of @xmath141@xcite and adopted @xmath142 in this paper .    with coupling constants summarized in table .",
    "i , we have : @xmath143 if the large @xmath144 indeed indicates a significant @xmath14 configuration inside @xmath2 resonance@xcite , assuming @xmath145 should be reasonable : @xmath146 then we will get @xmath147 , which may indicate a relatively large proportion of strangeness in @xmath2 resonance .",
    "but the large @xmath144 is also probably caused by the gluonium component of @xmath2 as can be seen in eqs.(20)(21 ) , then if @xmath148 is assumed : @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151@xcite .",
    "then we will get @xmath152 , and this may also indicate a relatively large proportion of gluons in @xmath2 resonance . certainly , according to above analysis , it is possible that strangeness and gluons coexist in @xmath2 , and it is two of them that induce the large couplings of @xmath2 to strange particles .",
    "recently , phenomenological analysis of radiative decays and other processes@xcite conclude no evidence of the gluonium contribution of @xmath0 wave function(i.e .",
    "@xmath153 ) , and this seems to support the idea that these large couplings are major caused by the @xmath14 component in @xmath2 .",
    "different 5-quark configurations of @xmath154 have deeply investigated , and admixture of 25 - 65% in @xmath2 is suggested@xcite .",
    "however , the intrinsic structure of @xmath2 is still left to be an open question and further study are needed .    in conclusion ,",
    "our phenomenological analysis to the @xmath0 production in nucleon - nucleon and @xmath1 collisions not only give nice reproduce to the experimental data , but also agree well with the present understanding of the internal component of the @xmath13 ( @xmath0 ) meson and @xmath2 resonance , although alternative contribution from other @xmath15 resonances are also possible .",
    "the ongoing relevant experiment in cosy@xcite will soon examine our results and advance a better knowledge of the @xmath13 and @xmath155 production .",
