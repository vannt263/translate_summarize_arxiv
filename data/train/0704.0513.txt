    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary stars containing a white dwarf primary star and a low - mass secondary star in a tight orbit @xcite . in most of these systems",
    "the secondary star is unevolved and fills its roche lobe , losing material to the white dwarf primary via an accretion disc . about a quarter of cvs",
    "contain magnetic white dwarfs , and these systems are split into two categories : the amher stars ( polars ) and the intermediate polars ( ips ) . in polars ,",
    "the strong magnetic field of the white dwarf causes its spin period , @xmath5 , to synchronise to the orbital period , @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution of these objects is expected to be strongly affected by interaction between the magnetic fields of the white dwarf and the late - type secondary star @xcite . in ips",
    "it is believed that the lower magnetic field of the white dwarf means that its rotation has not become synchronised to the orbital motion .",
    "the evolution of ips and in particular their relation to polars is still a debated issue ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter nws04 ) .    while the total number of confirmed ips has been boosted substantially over the past few years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only a handful of these have short orbital periods ( i.e. , below the 23hr gap which is prevalent in the observed population of cvs ) .",
    "conversely , the known population of polars mostly lies below @xmath7hr @xcite .",
    "this has led to suggestions that long - period ips may evolve into short - period polars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a detailed theoretical study by nws04 found that in general this should be the case",
    "however , those with a white dwarf magnetic moment of @xmath8g@xmath9 _ and _ secondary stars with weak magnetic fields will remain ips , because the magnetic interaction between the stars is not strong enough to synchronise the the rotation of the white dwarf to the orbital motion .",
    "this picture of the evolution of magnetic cvs has not yet been confirmed observationally because very few short - period ips are known .",
    "we are conducting a research program @xcite to measure the orbital periods of objects spectroscopically identified as cvs @xcite by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the main motivation of this work lies in the characterisation of an homogeneously identified sample of cvs which can be used to investigate the properties of the intrinsic cv population .",
    "the relatively faint limiting magnitude of the sdss spectroscopic observations means that this survey is much less biased towards intrinsically brighter objects than previous work . a very high proportion of the sdss cvs which we have studied so far are faint short - period systems ( @xcite ; ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paperi ) ; @xcite ) . in paperi",
    "we found that sdssj023322.61 + 005059.5 was a probable ip with @xmath10min and @xmath11min .",
    "here we present a detailed analysis of another system , sdssj233325.92@xmath0152222.1 ( hereafter sdssj2333 ) , which we find to be an ip with @xmath12min and @xmath13minjkt/ ] .",
    "@xcite presented the identification spectrum of sdssj2333 alongside time - resolved photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "they found modulation at 21min in the light curve and at 82min in the h@xmath14 and h@xmath15 emission line radial velocities , and suggested that this object could be an ip with an orbital period close to the 80min period minimum for cvs @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectrum shows the balmer and he emission lines characteristic of cvs as well emission at he 4686  which is a hallmark of magnetic systems . whilst the balmer and he lines have the double - peaked profile indicative of an accretion disc , the he line is single - peaked .",
    "however , it is difficult to conclude anything from this because the line may be contaminated by emission from the c and n bowen blend .",
    "x - ray emission from sdssj2333 was not detected by rosat .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ , > , > , > \" , ]     in table[tab : ipperiod ] we have collected the observed orbital and spin periods for the five confirmed ips with @xmath16hr .",
    "these are plotted in fig.[fig:2333:ipplot ] .",
    "classification as an ip requires the presence of coherent variation at the white dwarf spin period over a significant span of time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as the photometric observations for an additional two objects , rxj1039.7@xmath170507 @xcite and sdssj023322.61 + 005059.5 ( paperi ) , have only a short baseline their ip nature needs additional confirmation",
    "the white dwarf magnetic moments , @xmath18 , of the objects in table[tab : ipperiod ] have been obtained from nws04 under the assumption that the systems are in rotational equilibrium , either taken from their table1 or estimated from their fig.2 .",
    "sdssj2333 is joined by the objects dwcancri and v1025centauri in having @xmath19 and @xmath20g@xmath9 .",
    "assuming a canonical white dwarf radius of 10@xmath21 m , this gives a field strength of 2 mg for the white dwarf .",
    "the properties of exhya are also similar , whereas those of the fifth system , htcam , are quite different .",
    "the majority of ips with @xmath22hr have @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath20g@xmath9 ( nws04 ) .",
    "this magnetic moment is strikingly similar to those of sdssj2333 , dwcnc and v1025cen .",
    "this is an empirical indication that long - period ips with @xmath23 conserve @xmath18 as they evolve and become short - period ips with @xmath19 .",
    "this is consistent with the evolutionary picture of magnetic cvs drawn by @xcite and nws04 .",
    "comparison of the orbital and spin periods of ips with short orbital periods .",
    "dotted lines indicate where the spin period is 0.1 , 0.25 and 0.5 times the orbital period .",
    "those systems which are not confirmed ips are plotted with open circles .",
    "the error bars are smaller than the points for all systems except sdssj023322.61 + 005059.5.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] +    htcam is a short - period ip with a lower @xmath18 of @xmath24g@xmath9 . in the scenario",
    "we have outlined , an object such as this will result from the evolution of systems which currently resemble sdssj223843.84@xmath0010820.7 ( aqr1 in @xcite ) for which @xmath25g@xmath9 has been estimated ( nws04 ) . a similar argument can be advanced for rxj1039.7@xmath170507 , which has @xmath26 which is very similar to that of several known ips ( nws04 ) , for example 1rxsj062518.2 + 733433 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found that there is a large continuum of equilibrium spin levels for short - period ips , and that an ip with a specific mass ratio , mass transfer rate and orbital period can have any of a wide range of values of @xmath5/@xmath6 , depending on the value of @xmath18    the theoretical calculations of nws04 suggest that long - period ips will evolve into polars unless @xmath8g@xmath9 and the magnetic field of the secondary star is weak . in this case",
    "they may become exhya - like systems as the interaction between the magnetic fields is too weak to synchronise the rotation of the white dwarf to the orbital motion .",
    "whilst there are twelve long - period ips listed in nws04 with @xmath18 similar to that of sdssj2333 , there are only four short - period systems with this property . as short - period cvs",
    "are predicted to be intrinsically far more common than long - period ones @xcite , this means either that the vast majority of the long - period ips become polars or that the known population of short - period ips is much less complete than for those with longer periods . the latter possibility could easily arise as short - period ips are in general intrinsically fainter than long - period ips @xcite .",
    "sdssj2333 was identified as a cataclysmic variable from a spectrum taken by the sdss , which shows strong double - peaked balmer emission , double - peaked he emission and the single - peaked he emission which is often found in cvs containing a magnetic white dwarf . we have measured its orbital period to be @xmath1min from a radial velocity analysis of the balmer emission lines .",
    "it is therefore another sdss - identified cv with an orbital period close to the minimum period for cvs containing unevolved mass donor stars .",
    "its light curve shows a strong variability with a double - humped nature and a period of @xmath2min , which is precisely half that of its orbital period .",
    "we interpret this as arising from hot spots on the surface of the white dwarf primary component caused by accretion of matter controlled by a mostly dipolar magnetic field .",
    "sdssj2333 is therefore the shortest - period example of a relatively rare class of short - period intermediate polars .",
    "an x - ray detection of its spin period is highly desirable to further investigate its ip nature .",
    "the fact that its spin period is precisely half of its orbital period suggests the presence of a physical mechanism which is maintaining this as an equilibrium state .",
    "four out of a total of five confirmed short - period ips , including sdssj2333 , have a spin period of approximately half their orbital period .",
    "these systems contain a white dwarf with a magnetic moment of @xmath20g@xmath9 ( corresponding to a field strength of about 2 mg ) .",
    "a relatively large number of long - period ( @xmath27hr ) ips have spin periods close to a tenth of their orbital periods and @xmath20g@xmath9 . from this",
    "we suggest that the population of long - period ips with @xmath28 will conserve @xmath18 during their later evolution and become short - period ips with @xmath29 .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the william herschel telescope , which is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm ) of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac ) .",
