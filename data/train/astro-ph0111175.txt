    "observations have shown that the milky way ( mw ) and other comparable disk galaxies are composed of a number of more - or - less discrete components .",
    "the broadest categories of these comprise the central bulge with a mass @xmath1 and characteristic radius of about 1  kpc , the galactic spheroid ( or stellar halo ) with a mass @xmath2 being mostly confined to within the solar radius and also containing globular clusters that add up to a mass of about @xmath3 , the embedded stellar and gaseous disk , and a hypothesised extensive dark matter halo surrounding the lot and extending to 20200  kpc ( gilmore , wyse & kuijken 1989 ; binney & merrifield 1998 , hereinafter bm , for reviews ) . for the mw",
    ", the disk can be subdivided into at least two components , namely the thin disk with a mass of about @xmath4 with exponential radial and vertical scale - lengths of approximately  @xmath5  kpc and @xmath6  pc , respectively , and the thick disk with roughly @xmath7  kpc and @xmath8  pc .",
    "near the sun , the thick disk comprises about 6  per cent of the thin disk mass ( robin et al . 1996 ; buser , rong & karaali 1999 ; vallenari , bertelli & schmidtobreick 2000 ; chiba & beers 2000 ; kerber , javiel & santiago 2001 ; reyl & robin 2001 ) , so that the thick disk mass amounts to @xmath9 .",
    "mass - models of the mw , let alone of other disk galaxies , remain rather uncertain though ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) .    the structure of galaxies is linked to the physics of their formation which is the topic of much on - going research ( e.g. chiba & beers 2000 ; reyl & robin 2001 ) .",
    "relevant to the long - term survival of thin disks is understanding the origin of the galactic thick disk .",
    "this component is made up mostly of low - metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath10 ) stars that have a velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk plane of @xmath11  pc / myr , compared to the significantly smaller @xmath12 of the thin disk , which varies from about 25  pc / myr for the youngest stars to about  25  pc / myr for stars about 10  gyr old ( fuchs et al .",
    "the classical work of wielen ( 1977 ) has shown that this increase can be understood as a result of progressive heating of the thin disk population through a diffusive mechanism .",
    "the heating agent remains elusive though .",
    "this is nicely evident in the work of asiain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who find that spiral arms and a central galactic bar alone can not account for the diffusion , and as shown by fuchs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , scattering off molecular clouds also can not produce the necessary heating .",
    "jenkins ( 1992 ) also shows that heating through spirals and molecular clouds and adiabatic heating through mass growth of the galactic disk do not lead to the observed rise in velocity dispersion with stellar age .",
    "even worse , assuming orbital diffusion does operate from some yet to be discovered scattering agent(s ) , the large @xmath12 for thick - disk stars can not be obtained from an extension of the wielen - heating law .",
    "it follows that the thick disk must have formed under different conditions .",
    "this may be expected naturally , given that thick disk stars are not substantially younger than the old halo stars , thus having been born at the very beginning of the formation of the galactic disk ( e.g. gilmore & wyse 2001 ) .",
    "there are two broad classes of theories for the formation of a thick disk component .",
    "one class of models involves the settling of an initially hot proto - galactic gas cloud .",
    "a thick disk may form as a result of dissipational settling to a thin disk ( burkert , truran & hensler 1992 ) . according to the alternative hypothesis the mw formed from many smaller components in a chaotic manner , leading first to the formation of the spheroidal components , and a few  gyr later , of the thin gaseous disk .",
    "perturbation of the early thin stellar disk through continued accretion of dwarf galaxies may have lead to a thick disk component , a scenario that has the advantage of not producing a vertical metallicity gradient in the disk .",
    "@xmath13-body computations , however , may cast doubt on this scenario , because realistic dwarf galaxies that have densities comparable to the parent galaxy are likely to be destroyed before they venture close enough to the disk to cause significant vertical heating ( huang & carlberg 1997 ; sellwood , nelson & tremaine 1998 ; velazquez & white 1999 ) , but the situation is not clear since adequate computational resolution of gas - rich and star - forming galactic disks is at present not possible .",
    "the current state of understanding concerning the mw thick disk is reviewed by norris ( 1999 ) , who stresses that its origin remains unclear , and by gilmore & wyse ( 2001 ) , who present the first results of an extensive observational uk ",
    "australian collaboration towards casting light on this issue .",
    "this paper addresses an additional mechanism that may be relevant to the thickness of disks , and which is motivated by recent progress on understanding star - cluster formation .",
    "section  [ sec : csf ] summarises clustered star formation and details the calculation of the stellar velocity distribution function .",
    "it also discusses known heating mechanisms active in disk galaxies that increase the velocity dispersion of stars with time .",
    "the large velocity dispersion of the thick disk is considered in section  [ sec : thickd ] by studying the velocity - field produced in a thin disk in which star - formation is actively on - ongoing .",
    "the initial cluster mass function ( icmf ) required to give the observed velocity dispersion is constrained .",
    "similarly , the residuals of thin - disk age  velocity - dispersion data over current understand of secular disk heating are analysed and linked to the star - formation history in section  [ sec : thind ] .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] contains a discussion of the findings , and concluding remarks follow in section  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "stars are essentially never observed to form in isolation , but rather in a spectrum of diversely - rich clusters .",
    "as outlined in kroupa ( 2001a ) and boily & kroupa ( 2001 ) , a star - cluster forms stars over a time period @xmath14  myr in a contracting gas - cloud . because the collapse time of an individual proto - star takes of the order of 0.1  myr@xmath15 , each proto - star decouples dynamically from the gas and has enough time to add to the growing star@xmath16gas system that is , consequently , approximately in virial equilibrium at any time provided the proto - cluster crossing time ( eqn  1 in kroupa 2001a ) is shorter than @xmath17 .",
    "this is true for cluster masses @xmath18 and cluster radii of 1  pc . in sufficiently rich clusters ,",
    "o  stars terminate star - formation , and a large proportion of the cluster stars become unbound as a result of rapid expulsion of the remaining gas and the intrinsically low star - formation efficiency , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the mass in stars and gas , respectively , before gas - expulsion .",
    "observations of very young clusters support this scenario .",
    "for example , the orion nebula cluster is at most  2  myr and probably only a few @xmath22  yr old , and already largely void of gas .",
    "similarly , the massive 30  doradus cluster in the large magellanic cloud is not much older and has already removed its gas .",
    "direct computations of these processes using the aarseth state - of - the art direct @xmath13-body code are now available . beginning with @xmath23 stars in an orion - nebula - cluster - like configuration , and assuming @xmath24 with the residual gas being blown out faster than the cluster s dynamical time , kroupa , aarseth & hurley ( 2001 )",
    "find that about  2/3 of the cluster stars are lost and form a rapidly expanding stellar association , while a pleiades - like cluster condenses as a nucleus near the origin of the flow .",
    "the relative number of massive stars remaining in the core that forms the cluster , and those that are lost , depends on the initial concentration of the cluster prior to gas expulsion , and whether the massive stars form near the centre of the cluster .",
    "this scenario is supported by the fact that the velocity dispersion in the orion nebula cluster is super - virial ( e.g. jones & walker 1988 ) , so that it is probably expanding now ( kroupa , petr & mccaughrean 1999 ; kroupa 2000 ; kroupa , aarseth & hurley 2001 ) . especially striking in this context is the very recent measurement of the velocity dispersion of stars in the 30  doradus cluster by bosch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who find @xmath25  pc / myr .",
    "this is too large for the cluster s mass , and the authors attribute the surplus kinetic energy as being due to binary - star orbital motion and a binary proportion among the massive stars of 100  per cent .",
    "the notion raised here is that the velocity dispersion may also appear inflated due to recent gas blow - out .",
    "this notion that star clusters form as the nuclei of expanding ob associations is also ( retrospectively ) supported by the distribution of young stars around the 30  doradus cluster suggesting it is the core of a stellar association ( seleznev 1997 ) , and the likely association of the @xmath26  persei cluster with the cas ",

    "furthermore , williams & hodge ( 2001 ) note that most of the young clusters in m31 are located within large ob associations .",
    "the unbound population expands approximately with a one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath27 , typical of the pre - gas - expulsion cluster@xmath16gas mixture . neglecting factors of the order of one , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the gravitational constant and @xmath30",
    "the characteristic embedded - cluster radius .",
    "it becomes immediately apparent that @xmath31  pc / myr ( 1  km / s@xmath321  pc / myr ) corresponds to @xmath33 coming close to a typical globular cluster mass if @xmath34  pc , which is typical for young embedded clusters that have characteristic radii @xmath35  pc ( @xmath36  pc is assumed in what follows , unless stated otherwise ; examples of results with @xmath37  pc are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : survad ] ) .",
    "most of the variation of @xmath27 stems from variations of the embedded cluster mass which spans many orders of magnitude in contrast to the typical radii of modest embedded clusters and very young massive clusters , all of which are more concentrated than a few  pc .",
    "for example , local modest embedded clusters have @xmath38  pc ( kaas & bontemps 2001 ; lada & lada 1991 ) , while the rich orion nebula cluster has @xmath39  pc ( hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "young massive clusters in external galaxies have @xmath40  pc ( e.g. r136 in the large magellanic cloud : massey & hunter 1998 ; sirianni et al .",
    "2000 ) and in massively interacting gas - rich galaxies , the antennae , the young massive clusters remain unresolved with @xmath41  pc ( whitmore 2001 ) .",
    "these clusters are , however , already void of their gas despite being less than a few myr old , so they should have already expanded ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is also true for the somewhat older clusters in a sample of early - type galaxies compiled by larsen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( @xmath43  pc ) , and in m31 williams & hodge ( 2001 ) note cluster radii @xmath41  pc for cluster ages between about  10 and 200  myr .",
    "expansion also implies that the observed velocity dispersion in clusters is smaller than @xmath44 .",
    "for example , ho & filippenko ( 1996 ) measure a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of about  1116  pc / myr for two extragalactic young massive star clusters .",
    "these have inferred masses of about @xmath45 and are 1020  myr old .",
    "smith & gallagher ( 2001 ) find  13  pc / myr for a young massive cluster ( @xmath46  myr old ) in  m82 , and deduce its mass to be about @xmath47 . if the present notion is correct and if @xmath48 , then the deduced cluster masses correspond to only about 30  per cent of their birth stellar masses ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "star - clusters with masses indicated in  ( [ eqn : typm ] ) are observed to form in profusion whenever gas - rich galaxies interact or are perturbed ( lancon & boily 2000 ; larsen 2001 for overviews ) .",
    "it is thus feasible that eqn  [ eqn : typm ] may indicate that the thick disk resulted from massive clusters forming in a thin disk , rather than being produced through orbital scattering by a merging satellite galaxy .",
    "perturbation of an early thin and gas - rich mw disk by a passing satellite may suffice to trigger the required star formation .      to address the above question",
    ", the distribution function of stellar velocities resulting from a burst of star formation needs to be estimated .",
    "attention is focused on velocities perpendicular to the galactic disk because motions in the plane are much more difficult to handle analytically since they depend on the evolving mass distribution throughout the entire mw .",
    "an extension to include the velocity ellipsoid would go beyond the scope of this scouting work , but will be addressed in future contributions .    as an ansatz the distribution of stellar velocities in one - dimension ( perpendicular to the galactic disk , @xmath49 ) in the cluster prior to gas - expulsion",
    "is assumed to be gaussian ( i.e. a one - dimensional schwartzschild distribution ) , @xmath50 @xmath51 being the centre - of - mass velocity of the cluster , and @xmath52 .",
    "gas expulsion leads to isotropic expansion , and the velocity dispersions in galactic radial and tangential directions can be linked to the z - component via the epicyclic approximation if sufficiently small compared to the circular velocity about the galaxy ( binney & tremaine 1987 , hereinafter bt ) .",
    "large expansion velocities would require detailed orbit integration in a self - consistent potential , which goes beyond the aim of the present study .",
    "after the gas is expelled from the cluster the major part of the stellar population is assumed to expand freely conserving this distribution but with a velocity dispersion somewhat reduced due to self - gravity , leaving behind the nucleus that forms the bound cluster ( kroupa et al .",
    "the cluster fills its tidal radius and has a much smaller velocity dispersion than @xmath53 , but analytical quantification is difficult since the processes operating in shaping the cluster are complex ( three - body and four - body encounters re - distributing kinetic energy into potential energy , stellar evolution , tidal field ) .",

    "-27 mm    on the other hand , according to the line - of - argument followed here , individual star - forming events produce associations that expand as a result of gas loss at different rates , and thus with different velocity dispersions depending on the particular star clusters sampled from the icmf .",

    "the analysis above serves to illustrate that clustered star - formation probably leaves an imprint in the stellar distribution function . taking jenkins ( 1992 ) model to be a correct description of the secular increase of @xmath12",
    ", the above analysis suggests that the star - formation rate in the mw may have been quietening down , that is , that the star - formation rate has been declining , and/or that the icmf may have been changing towards smaller cluster masses .",
    "the analysis presented in this contribution serves to demonstrate that the kinematics of stars in the mw disk and other galaxies may be influenced by stellar birth in clusters .",
    "however , the application to specific kinematical abnormalities in the thin disk , and to the thick disk , is to be viewed as suggestive rather than definitive .",
    "the model set - up in section  [ sec : veldistr ] is simple but sufficient for this first exploration of how the kinematically hot component emerging from a cluster - forming event may affect the stellar distribution function in a galaxy .    the model ( eqn  [ eqn : truevd ] ) neglects possible variations of the star - formation efficiency with cluster mass and the possible variation of the gas - expulsion time - scale , which may be much longer than the dynamical time of embedded massive clusters ( tan & mckee 2001 ) .",
    "if this is so , then the stellar cluster reacts adiabatically to gas removal , and the final velocity dispersion in the cluster will be reduced by a factor @xmath68 ( mathieu 1983 ) .",
    "the velocity distribution function of escaping stars is , in this case , much more difficult to estimate .",
    "it nevertheless remains a function of @xmath186 , so that the essence of the argument here remains valid , although the detailed solutions evident in figs .  [ fig : survad ] and  [ fig : diffvd ] would change somewhat towards larger cluster masses .",
    "furthermore , the present models do not take into account that the star clusters , which form as nuclei of the expanding stellar associations , continue to add to the thick disk by ejecting high - velocity stars due to three- and four - body encounters .",
    "this is evident for massive young clusters ( figs .  2 and  3 in kroupa 2001c ) as well as clusters that typically form the galactic field population ( kroupa 1998 ) .",
    "while such events are rare , the implication is that the hot disk component should have a complex metallicity and age structure .",
    "a next stage in this project is to assemble synthetic disk populations using high - precision direct @xmath13-body calculations of cluster ensembles .",
    "this model predicts a complex velocity field in galaxies that are actively forming star - clusters . in the mw",
    "this is evident through expanding ob associations , and the empirical finding that the velocity dispersions of theses differ ( asiain et al .",
    "ob associations are most probably only the central regions of the expansive flow , because massive stars either form centrally concentrated , or they sink to the centres of their embedded cluster essentially on a dynamical timescale .",
    "if a young cluster can approximately establish energy equipartition between the stars before gas expulsion , then the massive sub - population will have a significantly smaller velocity dispersion than the low - mass members .",
    "furthermore , an expanding association looses its fast - moving stars early .",
    "an observer with a limited survey volume therefore underestimates the velocity dispersion .",
    "the exploratory analysis presented here neglects the other velocity components .",
    "focus is entirely on the component perpendicular to the galactic disk , easing the analysis .",
    "however , according to the notion presented here , the birth of a star cluster leads to an initially isotropically expanding stellar population .",
    "the velocity spheroid , given by the ratio of the velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk ( @xmath187 ) , towards the galactic centre ( @xmath188 ) and in the direction of the motion of the local standard of rest ( @xmath189 ) , is thus initially spherical .",
    "stars expelled from their cluster towards the galactic centre accelerate and overtake the other stars , while stars leaving the cluster in the opposite direction are decelerated by the galactic potential and fall behind .",
    "the velocity spheroid is thus distorted due to the differential rotation , and it will be an interesting problem to investigate if the observed velocity spheroid is consistent with the present notion . for the thin disk fuchs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) gives @xmath190 , independent of age , while chiba & beers ( 2000 ) find for the thick disk @xmath191 .",
    "such differences may partially be due to secular heating mechanisms such as scattering off molecular clouds and spiral arms that decrease @xmath192 ( gerssen , kuijken & merrifield 2000 ) .",
    "this is more efficient for the colder thin disk population .",
    "adiabatic heating due to the growth of the mw disk also evolves the velocity spheroid , and a passing satellite galaxy induces a radial compression of the gaseous disk which can lead to enhanced star formation and an increased radial velocity dispersion owing to star formation in the radially inflowing gas and the formation of a bar .",
    "a full model of the velocity spheroid is thus highly non - trivial and subject to the details of the satellite orbit and the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the literature contains various estimates of age  velocity - dispersion data , and contradictory claims have been made .",
    "it is thus useful to cast an independent eye at the situation ( section  [ sec : thindat ] ) .",
    "the star - formation history of the thin - disk is also briefly discussed in section  [ sec : thinhist ] .",
    "the most reliable age  velocity - dispersion data come from the ( distance - limited ) solar - neighbourhood sample contained in the fourth version of the catalogue of nearby stars originally compiled at the astronomisches rechen - institut ( ari ) in heidelberg by the late gliese and continued by jahreiss ( cns4 , e.g. jahreiss et al .",
    "1999 ; fuchs et al .",
    "this sample has been yielding consistent results over the past 23 decades ( e.g. wielen 1977 ) despite significant improvements such as the inclusion of hipparcos data for the majority of the stars .",

    "work has not been able to explain the strong apparent heating of stars with age , the data set has been questioned by a variety of researchers . for example , bm point to the work of stroemgren ( 1987 ) .",
    "stroemgren used a preliminary version of the edvardsson , andersen & gustafsson ( 1993 ) catalogue to select a sample of stars with @xmath193[fe / h]@xmath194 and found essentially no increase in @xmath27 for ages older than about 4  gyr , in stark contrast to the results based on the cns4 data , suggesting that this metal - rich thin - disk subpopulation was not subject to the heating mechanism advocated by wielen and co - workers at the ari . from fig .",
    "[ fig : obsvd ] it in fact follows that the best available theoretical work is in next to excellent agreement with these data .",

    "furthermore , the large velocity dispersions of the older cns4 thin - disk stars are verified by independent work .",
    "notably , reid et al . ( 1995 , their table  6 ) also find @xmath195  pc / myr for stars with @xmath196 .",
    "such a large @xmath12 is also obtained for stars within the very immediate solar - neighbourhood with distances less than 5.2  pc ( kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ) .",

    "( 2001 , their fig .  4 ) .",
    "the above discussion serves to demonstrate on the one hand that some uncertainties remain in the definition of the age  velocity - dispersion data , but that the evidence lies in favour of the results obtained from the cns4 ( e.g. fuchs et al . 2001 ) , i.e. that stars have velocity dispersions that increase more steeply with age than theory can account for .",
    "it is notable that the suggestive finding in section  [ sec : thind ] that the star - formation rate may have declined in the last few  gyr is similar to the conclusion of fuchs et al .",

    "[ fig : diffvd ] .",
    "janes & phelps ( 1994 ) indeed find an old cluster population of galactic clusters that have a vertical scale - height of about 300  pc similar to old thin disk stars , and may thus have been heated from @xmath197  pc / myr to about 15  pc / myr as described by jenkins model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obsvd ] ) , although cluster - survival of scattering events is controversial , and it may be necessary to allow @xmath117  pc / myr during the star - burst that formed this cluster population .",

    "a perturbation by a passing satellite galaxy may have induced significant star formation leading to the thick disk component .",
    "however , it may well be that the thick disk formed with a cluster  cluster velocity dispersion @xmath200  pc / myr due to the probably turbulent and chaotic conditions leading to the assembly of the thin disk , later being heated adiabatically to  35  pc / myr . in this alternative and maybe more plausible scenario",

    "a large fraction of these metal - rich globular clusters may rather belong to a bulge population , so that a definitive identification of metal - rich globular clusters as being the fossils of the thick - disk star - formation events can not be made .",
    "any such population of clusters is likely to have suffered some orbital decay towards the mw disk through non - isotropic dynamical friction on the disk ( binney 1977 ) , implying that the original thickness of the metal - rich globular cluster disk population may have been larger than the present value , possibly compromising its association with the stellar thick disk .",
    "the age  velocity - dispersion relation for the mw is addressed by considering the effects that star - cluster formation may have on the velocity field of stars .",
    "star clusters form with star - formation efficiencies @xmath201 and they are probably near global gravitational equilibrium just before the remaining gas is expelled .",
    "observational evidence suggests that gas expulsion is rapid , so that the majority of stars expand outwards with a velocity dispersion that is related to the velocity dispersion prior to gas expulsion .",
    "this scenario implies that the distribution function of stars in galaxies should reflect these events .",
    "peculiar kinematical features , such as enhanced velocity dispersions for stars of particular ages , may thus be the result of specific star - formation events , or bursts , that produced star - clusters with masses larger than that typical under more quiescent star - forming conditions .",
    "an empirical correlation between cluster mass and star - formation rate is established by larsen ( 2001 ) .",
    "the calculations presented here show that the velocity distribution function of stars emerging from a star - formation event is distinctly non - gaussian with a low - dispersion @xmath139-peak and broad wings ( figs .",

    "it is noteworthy that reid et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that the velocity distribution of solar - neighbourhood stars shows structure reminiscent of the present models .",
    "ancient thin - disk stars with overlapping metallicities to those of thick - disk stars may , according to this interpretation , be the kinematically cold @xmath139-peak of the star - formation burst that formed the thick disk .    examples of star - formation bursts leading to abnormal kinematical signatures may be the galactic thick disk , and possible star - formation bursts about 14  gyr and 57  gyr ago evident in the age  velocity - dispersion data for the solar neighbourhood .",
    "these kinematical abnormalities are analysed here by calculating the velocity distribution function assuming stars form in ensembles of star clusters distributed either as power - law or as log - normal initial cluster mass functions ( icmfs ) .",

    "the results are plausible when compared to direct surveys of the icmf ( section  [ sec : veldistr ] ) . the putative star - formation burst 57  gyr ago",
    "may be associated with the population of old ( and thus initially relatively massive ) galactic clusters identified by janes & phelps ( 1994 ) .",
    "satellite infall or perturbation may still be responsible for a burst of star formation that allows more massive clusters to form , but , as shown here , heating of galactic disks may not require direct satellite infall into the disk .",
    "it is thus interesting that rocha - pinto et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find possible correlations between their star - formation history and the orbit of the magellanic clouds , which in turn can be correlated with the above mentioned age  velocity - dispersion abnormalities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffvd ] ) .",
    "schwarzkopf & dettmar ( 2000 ; 2001 ) find that perturbed disk galaxies are significantly thicker than isolated disk galaxies .",
    "the present notion does not exclude that disk thickening can also be induced through satellites or high - velocity clouds hitting disks directly .",
    "the notion raised here readily carries over to populating the galactic spheroid through forming star clusters , only the most massive of which survived to become the present - day globulars .",
    "it also carries over to properties of the distribution function of moving groups associated with the formation of individual distant globular clusters in the out - reaches of the galactic halo .",
    "the concept introduced here relies on the unbound star - cluster population expanding with a velocity that depends on the cluster configuration before gas expulsion ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : truevd ] ) .",
    "this can be tested with high - precision astrometry .",
    "a perfect test - bed is the large magellanic cloud which is forming star clusters profusely , probably as a result of being tidally perturbed ( van der marel 2001 ) .",
    "thus , upcoming space - astrometry missions ( diva : rser 1999 ; gaia : lindegren & perryman 1996 and gilmore et al . 1998 ) should measure complex velocity fields in the lmc , since each very young but gas - free cluster should have associated with it an approximately radially expanding population of stars with an overall velocity dispersion characteristic of the conditions before gas - expulsion .",
    "evidence for this is emerging ( section  [ sec : csf ] ) .",
    "if an empirical upper limit on the velocity dispersion of expanding associations independent of @xmath20 for some value larger than @xmath202 can be found , then this would serve as an important constraint on the star - formation efficiency and gas - expulsion time for clusters more massive than @xmath202 .",
