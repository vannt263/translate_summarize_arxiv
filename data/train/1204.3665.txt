    "it is commonly believed that determination of the shape of neutrino mass matrix could shade a light on a mass generation mechanism and give us some information about model lying behind it .",
    "many attempts have been made in literature ( e.g. @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to restrict the form of neutrino mass matrices . in general",
    "we can divide them into two categories which are called `` top - down '' - where the neutrino masses , the mixing angles and the cp violation phases are predicted from a given mass matrix , and `` bottom - up '' method - where the existing neutrino data determine possible shape of the mass matrix .    in the `` top - down '' method the neutrino mass matrix , its textures @xcite and symmetries",
    "are predicted from some theory beyond the standard model ( sm ) . and the other way in `` bottom - up '' approach , from neutrino mass matrix we can find all physical neutrino parameters as well as unphysical phases . for three and four neutrino states we can do everything analytically . for a larger number of neutrinos , only numerical method can be used .",
    "we use the base where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal so the unitary matrix which diagonalize neutrino mass matrix is also , with an accuracy to non - physical phases , the ordinary maki , nakagawa , sakata , pontecorvo ( mnsp ) mixing matrix .    in this paper both method",
    "are presented .",
    "we will focus on the simpleast , but still realistic , three dimensional case . for the `` bottom - up '' case we generalize the approach given in paper @xcite were only cp conserving problems were considered . from this paper among other things",
    "we have learned that textures of @xmath1 with number of zeros @xmath2 do not reproduce experimental data ( at @xmath3 c.l . ) , there are seven two zero textures which give results in agreement with present data , some of them can produce normal , inverse and degenerate mass hierarchies .",
    "the important goal of present considerations is to check if the cp breaking case is able to change the properties of the mass matrix which still predicts the correct neutrino parameters ( chapter ii ) . in the `` top -down ''",
    "approach we give exact formulas for the neutrino masses , mixing angles , dirac and majorana mixing phases .",
    "we show how the unphysical phases depends on the parametrization of the mnsp mixing matrix ( chapter iii ) . at the end",
    "we give some conclusion ( chapter iv ) .",
    "for majorana neutrinos , which we consider , the mass matrix @xmath4 must be symmetric and to have cp symmetry breaking in the lepton sector , must be also complex .",
    "in general @xmath5 dimensional symmetric matrix can be described by @xmath6 independent parameters . in our case",
    "@xmath7 we can have @xmath8 parameters - six modulus and six phases .",
    "such a matrix can be diagonalized by unitary transformation : @xmath9 where unitary matrix @xmath10 is parametrized by : @xmath11 @xmath12 is the standard mnsp @xcite , @xcite mixing matrix as for dirac neutrino : @xmath13 where as usually we use abreviation e.g. @xmath14 and so on , and : @xmath15    for @xmath16 dimensional case we have nine physical parameters : three masses @xmath17 , three mixing angels @xmath18 and three phases @xmath19 - dirac phase , and two majorana phases : @xmath20 .",
    "+ matrix @xmath21 is composed by 3 non - physical and unmeasurable phases  @xmath22 .",
    "+ using the reverse relation to ( [ 1 ] ) we can express all elements ( separately imaginary and real parts ) of the mass matrix as a function of : @xmath23 and found their minimal and maximal values for current @xcite experimental data . in such way for the given neutrino mass hierarchy we are able to show each possible area as a function of the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "such a distribution shows us for example possible texture zeros regions .",
    "+ only one plot for @xmath24 as a function of the ligthest neutrino mass @xmath25 for normal mass hierarchy , seperately for the absolute value and the phase is presented in fig 1 .",
    "+ for the other elements see our page @xcite .",
    "this plot reconstructs the results obtained in neutrinoless double beta experiments @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the absolute value of @xmath26 is larger than zero ( i ) everywhere , for vanishing majorana phase , and ( ii ) for @xmath27 , independently of the values of majorana phases .",
    "the modulus and phase @xmath28 of that element do not depend on unphysical phases @xmath29 .",
    "here we present some simple method of finding unambiguous analytical relations between oscillation parameters and mass matrix elements .",
    "first for any majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath4 we diagonalize the hermitian matrix @xmath30 such a matrix is diagonalized by unitary transformation : @xmath31 where the unitary matrix @xmath32 is build from the eigenvectors of @xmath33 : @xmath34 and eigenvalues @xmath35 are squares of neutrino masses .",
    "the normalized eigenvectors are set out with an accuracy of phase .",
    "we can use that freedom in order to find matrix u which diagonalize @xmath4 as in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with real and positive eigenvalues @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 the new phases @xmath38 also depends on the element of @xmath4 . now comparing eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ u ] ) we can find relations : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 respectively and @xmath51 . + analytical details for presented equations are given in the appendix .",
    "we have presented two possible approaches of studies neutrino mass matrix . for `` bottom - up '' method",
    "we have get possible values of @xmath4 matrix elements from current experimental data . as a example we have presented @xmath52 element which agrees with the neutrinoless double beta decay observations .",
    "+ we have learned that majorana phases are crucial to get some texture for neutrino mass matrix e.g. zero texture . any other symmetry imposed on @xmath4",
    "can be studied in the same way .",
    "whole set of plots and computer program used for calculations is possible to see on web - page @xcite . from `` top - down '' method",
    "we have learned how to find all physical neutrino parameters from given neutrino mass matrix which follow from any physics beyond the sm .",
    "this knowledge is useful in future plan context .",
    "we would like to enlarge our analytical solutions for @xmath53 mass matrix case and numerical solutions for @xmath54 dimensional @xmath4 ( i.e like presented in @xcite ) .     for normal mass hierarchy as a function of lightest neutrino mass @xmath25 .",
