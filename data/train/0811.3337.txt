    "the statistical analysis of turbulent flow has a long tradition and has revealed a lot of insight into the properties of turbulence , starting with the pioneering works of @xcite .",
    "however , in the transition regimes between isotropic turbulence as one idealisation and laminar flow as another idealisation , our knowledge is still incomplete .",
    "this is even more the case when turbulence outside the laboratory is studied . the air flow in the atmospheric boundary layer ( abl ) , i.e.  in the lowest few 12  km of the atmosphere ( see * ? ?",
    "* ) , is strongly influenced by surface roughness and hence orography and land use , but even more by geothermal effects through heating from the ground .",
    "both effects do not only introduce additional structures into the turbulent flow , but also cause non - stationarities because these effects depend , e.g.  on the intensity of solar radiation and on the direction of the surface wind , which both change much faster than large scale pressure differences which generate the overall wind conditions .    in several applications ,",
    "a better understanding of the statistical properties of boundary layer turbulence under realistic conditions is essential , in particular in view of the cost efficient use of wind power .",
    "one example is that more realistic input wind fields than just laminar flows are desired for numerical simulations of the flow around an obstacle .",
    "another example is the need of good statistical evidence of extreme wind gusts , their relative frequency , their spatial extension , and also their temporal correlations for the estimation of loads on structures and their expected lifetimes .    motivated by these considerations",
    ", we will here discuss the detailed analysis of boundary layer wind fields .",
    "moreover , since theoretical concepts such as that of @xcite were developed for an idealised turbulence , we investigate in how far these results hold true for abl turbulence .",
    "we therefore consider time series recordings obtained by a single anemometer at fixed height above ground .",
    "the wind field at position @xmath0 and time @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the time series is given by the horizontal component @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 standing for the measurement frequency .",
    "making use of the @xcite hypothesis , i.e.  temporal correlations can be translated into spatial longitudinal correlations , our analysis aims at a quantitative characterisation of the statistics of horizontal wind speed data .    throughout our analysis",
    "the non - stationarity of the data plays a major role and we intend to answer the question which parameters remain constant or can be regarded as being piece - wise constant and how to estimate them .",
    "we draw the conclusion that natural abl turbulence is a composition of successively occurring close to ideal turbulence with different parameters .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same conclusion was drawn in a recent work by @xcite .",
    "however , the authors applied a different statistical method and concentrated on the wind speed increments .",
    "as for experimental data we study wind speed recordings acquired at 10  m altitude with a frequency of 8  hz at the @xcite site .",
    "it clearly exemplifies abl turbulence .",
    "the results of data gathered at 20  m and 30  m above ground do not differ qualitatively .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the first part we study the fluctuation of the horizontal wind speed around its mean behaviour .",
    "empirically , the standard deviation of the fluctuation grows linearly with the mean wind speed .",
    "we explain a method how to estimate the proportionality factor .",
    "the second part deals with the statistics of wind speed increments .",
    "the empirical results are compared to theoretical works which assume the correctness of the intermittency hypothesis of turbulence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these works state that the distribution of short time increments is strongly leptokurtic .",
    "the parameters describing this distribution are in good approximation piece - wise constant . the superstatistical approach , which the third part of this paper deals with , is sensitive enough to actually quantify the dynamics of the distribution parameters .",
    "finally , the last section contains the conclusions .",
    "the first method which we want to give an introduction to analyses the fluctuation of the wind speed around its window mean over @xmath6 sample points with @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , we consider the fluctuation series @xmath8 where @xmath9 figure  [ f : f ] ( top row ) shows three days of measurement at the @xcite site illustrating the non - stationarity of abl wind speed . the same kind of non - stationarity is inherited in @xmath10 so that the mean of the fluctuation @xmath11 is ( at least nearly ) constant with @xmath12 , namely zero .",
    "the second row of the figure displays the fluctuation series @xmath13 for @xmath14 chosen exemplarily to be 101 .",
    "thus , the fluctuation corresponds to the wind speed deviation at time @xmath12 from the 12.5  s window mean around @xmath12 .",
    "it can be seen that the fluctuation series is centered around zero and that its volatility becomes larger as the wind speed @xmath15 , and hence the mean wind speed @xmath10 , increases .",
    "we are interested in the functional dependence of the volatility of the fluctuation from the mean wind speed .",
    "hence , collecting the events @xmath16 allows us to estimate numerically the variance of the set @xmath17 for each 24  h sample individually .",
    "this variance can be identified with the conditioned volatility @xmath18 under the assumption that the conditioned variance @xmath19}$ ] does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ f : propto ] shows the empirical result : the proportionality @xmath21 can be verified for each 24  h data individually .",
    "figure  [ f : propto ] ( right ) reveals that the proportionality becomes better as @xmath22 becomes larger .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ f : f ] that the wind speed can be low during the night hours where the wind is less turbulent causing @xmath23 to be comparably small .     which corresponds to a time window of 12.5  s ]     ( left ) and @xmath23 ( right ) as a function of the @xmath24 window mean wind speed @xmath22 estimated from 24  h recordings at the @xcite site , title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left ) and @xmath23 ( right ) as a function of the @xmath24 window mean wind speed @xmath22 estimated from 24  h recordings at the @xcite site , title=\"fig : \" ]    the proportionality factor differs slightly from day to day .",
    "consequently , splitting the set @xmath25  into two disjoint subsets @xmath26 and @xmath27 whose union is @xmath25 , abl data show that the variance of the set @xmath28 might not coincide with the variance of @xmath29 .",
    "we therefore need to refine the method .    from a meteorological point of view",
    ", the considered variances are mainly determined by the stratification and thus the richardson number . the abl wind field is strongly influenced by geothermal effects changing with time ( day / night cycle , clouds etc . )",
    ". we should therefore expect @xmath30 } } = a_n(m ) \\bar x^{(m)}_n\\ ] ] with a time dependent @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that the proportionality factor changes on a larger time scale than the fluctuation so that it can be approximated by being piece - wise constant over @xmath32 time steps . we therefore assume @xmath33 for @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the time of the day . defining @xmath36 and assuming that the volatility of the fluctuation at time @xmath37 does not depend on @xmath12 , the normalised fluctuation @xmath38 with @xmath39 has a time - independent volatility for @xmath37 .",
    "we denote the mentioned volatilities by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , and write @xmath42 so that @xmath43 in other words , the standard deviation of the fluctuation grows linearly with @xmath22 if the standard deviation of the normalised fluctuation does not depend on @xmath22 .",
    "the latter is equivalent to saying that the volatility of @xmath44 remains constant for @xmath45 . under this assumption",
    "we can estimate the proportionality factor @xmath46 by computing the standard deviation of the set @xmath47 .",
    "figure  [ f : a ] depicts the so obtained proportionality factors over a period of eleven days of measurement .",
    "the top panel contains @xmath48 as a step function of time @xmath35 with @xmath49 and 24  h. the lower three panels depict the proportionality factor approximated by a step function with 1/2 , 2 , and 8  h plateaus exemplarily for the days 186 , 191 , and 192 of the measurement .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath46 changes with time leading to the question whether its approximation of being constant over a period is suitable .     at the @xcite site estimated in successive periods of lengths @xmath32 .",
    "the top panel shows the `` long - term '' behaviour over eleven days of measurement ( @xmath50 ) whereas the lower three panels depict three 24  h samples individually ( @xmath51 ) ]     over @xmath24 time steps for the wind data acquired at the @xcite site .",

    "moreover , the @xmath175-plots in the central panel reveal that for large @xmath87 the shape parameter of each sub - sample approaches zero as it is expected from the intermittency hypothesis .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that castaing s hypothesis is fulfilled during time intervals of 2  h. but it is violated on larger time scales , such as 24  h , due to non - stationarity which are reflected by the time dependence of @xmath167 and @xmath168 . in other words ,",

    "the superstatistical algorithm was used to extract the @xmath160-series from the 24  h time series @xmath117 and tested for gaussianity .",
    "the upper left panel of figure  [ f : super : day186:24h ] shows the histogram @xmath155 for @xmath156 which is clearly non - gaussian shaped .",
    "this explains the small deviation of @xmath91 in figure  [ f : inc : hi ] from the fitted castaing distribution for @xmath156 .",
    "the 24  h increment series @xmath117 was also divided into twelve 2  h sub - samples where each of which was analysed with respect to superstatistics individually .",
    "figure  [ f : super : day186:2h ] shows the castaing parameters @xmath167 and @xmath176 as a function of time @xmath35 .",
    "the time span @xmath177 is the only region where castaing s hypothesis can not be rejected on a 2  h scale with @xmath162 : the kolmogorov - smirnov test value @xmath161 is below the critical value and the shape parameter @xmath176 goes to zero as @xmath87 gets larger .",
    "that means that both castaing s hypothesis and the cross - over behaviour can be recovered in the mentioned time span on windows of 2  h period . outside this region ,",
    "the length of 2  h for the sub - samples is still too large or in other words the resolution is too low for recovering a normally distributed @xmath160-series .",
    "however , going to smaller sub - samples gives worse statistics due to the reduced number of data points in each sub - sample .",
    "nevertheless , the increments of this day are much more non - stationary than the data gathered at day 191 .",
    "it exemplifies that high non - stationarity of wind speed data cause a fat tailed increment distribution for large increment length @xmath87 .    the data acquired at day 192 at the lammefjord site show similar behaviour to the day 191 data when analysed with respect to superstatistics .",
    "as a summary , the superstatistical approach is sensitive enough to detect sub - regions of the increment series where castaing s hypothesis is fulfilled .",
    "in such a region the increment distribution takes the shape given in  . the position and shape parameter change with time as they differ between different sub - regions .",
    "this makes this approach be capable of determining the dynamics of @xmath178 and @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , it can be used to verify that wind speed data with large fluctuating castaing parameters have a non - gaussian increment distribution at large increment lengths .",
    "our study verified the picture of natural abl turbulence to be composed of successively occurring close to ideal turbulence with different parameters .",
    "we showed that in good approximation the fluctuation of the the wind speed around its window average @xmath22 is of a symmetric normal distribution with a standard deviation being proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "the proportionality factor can be estimated by the standard deviation of the normalised fluctuation .",
    "the investigation of the time dependent volatility of the normalised fluctuation leads to the time resolution of the proportionality factor . our analysis showed that approximating it by being constant over 24  h is reasonable .",
    "however , within 24  h the mean wind speed changed frequently leading to two separate time scales : the time scale on which the mean wind speed changes and the time scale on which the proportionality factor between the mean wind speed and the standard deviation of the fluctuation can be approximated as being constant .",
    "the mean speed of stationary laboratory turbulence does not alter with time so that the @xmath22 dependence of the fluctuation distribution can not be investigated by means of such experiments . nevertheless , the fluctuation is of a normal distribution , too , leading to the conclusion that abl turbulence is a sequence of stationary turbulence with varying mean .",
    "the intermittency behaviour of abl wind speed was tested using the increment statistics approach .",
    "the coincidence between the empirical histograms and the hypothetical distributions makes the increment series in this representation look stationary .",
    "however , castaing s intermittency hypothesis involves a time scale separation . on a small scale the wind speed increments are of a symmetric normal distribution whose variance alters on a larger scale according to a log - normal distribution .",
    "we checked this time scale separation using a superstatistical approach .",
    "we found that there is a `` critical '' time scale below which the increment series behaves normally distributed and above which the increment series is of a leptokurtic distribution . in the terminology of superstatistics",
    "this time scale is referred to as the large time scale in contrast to the small time scale reflecting the relaxation time of the increment process .",
    "if the latter is small compared to the large time scale it is possible to estimate the variance of each gaussian segment and analyse their statistics .",
    "we found that their logarithm is not exactly of a stationary normal distribution but rather of a sequence of normal distributions with varying mean and variance .",
    "this incorporates a third time scale into the abl wind speed increment series on which the log - normal distribution of the variances in the sense of castaing s hypothesis can be approximated as being stationary .",
    "the study was supported by germany s federal ministry for education and research ( bmbf ) under grant number 03sf0314 .",
    "it is part of the joint project `` statistical analysis and stochastic modelling of turbulent gusts in surface wind '' ."
