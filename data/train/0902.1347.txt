    "there is overwhelming evidence that non - baryonic dark matter must exist in large quantities in the universe , yet its composition remains unknown .",
    "an interesting possibility , especially in light of anticipated data from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    ", is that dark matter consists of at least one species of elementary particle that is part of an extension to the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "such extensions bridge the theoretical gap between the electroweak symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath3 gev ) and the planck scale ( @xmath4 gev ) , and many naturally produce wimps in roughly the quantities and with behavior consistent with observations @xcite ( e.g. , the neutralino in supersymmetry @xcite , the kaluza - klein photon in universal extra dimension ( ued ) models @xcite , or the heavy photon in little higgs models @xcite )",
    ".    there are three main approaches to the detection and characterization of wimps .",
    "first , wimps may be created at the lhc or in future collider experiments @xcite .",
    "secondly , astrophysical wimps may be directly detected by measuring the energy deposited in a target during an interaction with a nucleus . while dark matter has not yet been conclusively detected in such experiments ( but see @xcite ) , limits on wimp - baryon cross sections are becoming ever more stringent .",
    "current experiments have target masses of @xmath5 kg , and are approaching sensitivities to elastic spin - independent wimp - proton cross sections of @xmath6@xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the experiments are starting to cut through swaths of minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and little higgs parameter space , but have yet to reach the cross sections possible with the simplest ued models @xcite . in the near future ,",
    "kiloton - sized experiments should probe spin - independent cross sections down to @xmath9 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "wimps can also have spin - dependent interactions with nuclei , but experimental limits on those are much weaker than on spin - independent cross sections @xcite .",
    "thirdly , it may be possible to detect particles created in annihilations of wimp pairs . many experiments ( most obviously _ fermi _ , but see also @xcite ) are searching for annihilation products from the galactic center , the milky way halo , or local group satellite galaxies  the latter sites are promising because they are predicted to have high dark matter densities , and the annihilation rate goes as the square of the density .",
    "the sun may also be a source of high energy neutrinos , arising from wimp annihilations at its core , since its potential well is deep enough that wimps may be captured ( i.e. , scattered onto orbits with speeds less than the local escape speed from the sun ) from the galactic dark halo by elastic scattering off solar nuclei .",
    "this signal may be observed by the next generation of large neutrino telescopes @xcite . for the locus of models that are consistent with direct detection constraints and may produce an observable wimp annihilation flux of neutrinos , the capture rate of wimps in the sun is dominated by spin - dependent interactions . in particular , since most of the mass of the sun is in the form of hydrogen , and hydrogen is the only species in the sun with a significant spin - dependent capture rate , neutrino telescopes should have very good sensitivity to @xmath10 , the spin - dependent wimp - proton cross section , currently the most poorly constrained of all wimp - baryon elastic scattering cross sections",
    ".    the power of neutrino telescopes to detect solar wimp annihilation has been demonstrated by the super - kamiokande experiment .",
    "the upper bound on the neutrino flux from this experiment was used to determine a conservative upper limit to @xmath10@xmath11 as a function of wimp mass ( using a method described in @xcite ) that is an order of magnitude better than the best limit set by direct detection , assuming that the wimp is the supersymmetric neutralino @xcite .",
    "the next generation of neutrino telescopes will have much larger detector areas ( @xmath12 km@xmath13 for antares @xcite , 1 km@xmath13 for icecube @xcite and km3net @xcite , versus @xmath14 km@xmath13 for super - kamiokande ) , albeit with somewhat higher energy thresholds , and should be sensitive to much lower elastic scattering cross sections than super - kamiokande ( by two orders of magnitude for icecube @xcite ) .    to estimate the event rate in neutrino telescopes from wimp annihilation in the sun for a particular model , one needs three basic ingredients .",
    "( i ) an estimate of the number density @xmath15 of wimps in the sun , and hence , the annihilation rate @xmath16 .",
    "( ii ) an understanding of how the decay products , especially neutrinos and particles that decay to neutrinos after having traveled some distance in the sun , interact and propagate through the sun , interplanetary space , and the earth .",
    "( iii ) a model of the charged - current interactions that produce muons in and near the detector volume and the sensitivity of the telescope to those muons .",
    "thus , the event rate in a neutrino telescope can be described schematically by @xmath17    ingredient ( iii ) is studied as part of the neutrino telescope design process",
    ". there has recently been significant progress in understanding ingredient ( ii ) @xcite .",
    "one consequence of the work on this subject is that the muon neutrino flux at the earth is quite uncertain for fixed wimp mass and interaction cross sections .",
    "neutrino oscillations may enhance or suppress the relevant @xmath18 flux in neutrino telescopes depending on the annihilation channel .",
    "for a given wimp mass and annihilation rate in the sun , the event rate at the earth can vary by a factor of @xmath5 depending on the annihilation branching ratios .",
    "traditionally , ingredient ( i ) has been treated as the simplest of these three sub - tasks in estimating neutrino event rates . in the standard picture , hereafter called the `` instantaneous thermalization model '' , wimps are captured in the sun via elastic scattering off solar nuclei , and then quickly thermalize into a dense core at the very center of the sun .",
    "the thermalization is crucial to generating a large annihilation rate since the annihilation rate varies as the square of the density of the core .",
    "this model of rapid thermalization of all captured heavy wimps is oversimplified for two reasons .",
    "first , the thermalization time depends on both the wimp - nucleon cross section and mass , since the cross section governs the characteristic time between scatters and the mass governs the number of scatters required for wimps to reach equilibrium with solar nuclei .",
    "if either the elastic scattering cross section is small or the wimp mass is large , thermalization timescales can be long .",
    "secondly , the sun is surrounded by a complement of planets . the gravitational torques from these planets can change  or even reduce to zero  the frequency with which wimps encounter solar nuclei by altering the orbital paths of the wimps through the solar system .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the validity of the instantaneous thermalization model and to provide more accurate estimates of the wimp annihilation rate in the sun .",
    "our principal tool will be a large set of numerical simulations of the evolution of wimps captured in the sun , including the gravitational influence of the planets and rescattering by solar nucleons ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "we will demonstrate that in some cases the instantaneous thermalization model overestimates the annihilation rate by a factor of ten or more .    in section [ sec : std ]",
    ", we describe the standard instantaneous thermalization calculation of the annihilation rate of wimps in the sun . in section [ sec : sim ] , we briefly describe our simulations , which are discussed in more detail in paper i. we show how the results of the simulations modify the standard picture of wimp annihilation in section [ sec : insight ] , and discuss our results in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the annihilation rate of wimps in the sun is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the time - dependent number density of wimps in the sun , and @xmath21 is the velocity - averaged annihilation cross section . for the remainder of this work , we take @xmath15 to be the number density of wimps captured in the sun , since in all cases where wimp annihilation is significant , the annihilation rate due to captured wimps is many orders of magnitude greater than the rate due to halo dark matter streaming through the solar system .",
    "if the captured wimp number density can be separated as @xmath22 an assumption that we show below to be valid for the instantaneous thermalization model , and @xmath23 is known and normalized such that @xmath24 , then the number @xmath25 of wimps in the sun can be described by @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the capture rate of wimps in the sun by elastic scattering of halo wimps with distribution function @xmath28 off solar nuclei with atomic number @xmath29 and distribution function @xmath30 .",
    "the interaction cross section is @xmath31 .",
    "wimps are only considered captured if the post - scatter speed of the wimp @xmath32 is less than the local escape speed @xmath33 .",
    "the coefficient in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dotn ] ) , @xmath34 , is defined by @xmath35 if the number density can be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : num_sep ] ) , @xmath34 is constant and has the form @xmath36 if the number density is not in the form ( [ eq : num_sep ] ) , then @xmath34 will be time - dependent and it will also be necessary to model the time - evolution of the density profile .",
    "the annihilation term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dotn ] ) is twice the annihilation rate because most theoretically motivated wimps are self - annihilating ; each annihilation event removes two wimps from the sun .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dotn ] ) , @xmath37 , is an evaporation rate .",
    "this term is important for very low mass wimps ( @xmath38 gev ) , since light wimps may gain enough energy from interactions with nucleons in the sun to become unbound to the solar system @xcite , but is negligible for the range of wimp masses ( @xmath39 gev ) generically expected in extensions to the sm .",
    "if @xmath40 and @xmath34 are time - independent and @xmath41 is negligible , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dotn ] ) has the solution @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the timescale for the number of wimps in the sun to reach equilibrium .",
    "( [ eq : n_t ] ) is subject to the boundary condition that @xmath44 at the birth of the solar system .",
    "the annihilation rate goes as @xmath45 which has the limits @xmath46    in the instantaneous thermalization model , the wimps captured in the sun settle quickly to an equilibrium ( i.e. , the thermalization time @xmath47 ) .",
    "thus , the wimp density profile is separable in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq : num_sep ] ) and can be described by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is determined by @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the wimp mass , @xmath52 is the gravitational potential of the sun , and @xmath53 is the characteristic temperature of wimps in the sun ( typically , the core temperature of the sun ) @xcite .",
    "since the density profile is fixed as a function of time , the solution eq .",

    "@xmath58 is the typical capture rate in the sun by hydrogen for a wimp with @xmath59 gev and wimp - proton elastic scattering cross section @xmath60 assuming that the mass density of wimps in the galactic halo is @xmath61 and that the local wimp population is smooth and approximately described by a maxwellian velocity distribution ( with one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the speed of the local standard of rest ) .",
    "if @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the mass of the target nucleus , the capture rate goes as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "the dependence of the capture rate on the wimp mass reflects not only the factor of @xmath68 from the wimp number density @xmath69 for fixed wimp mass density but also kinematic suppression since it is difficult for halo wimps to transfer enough energy to solar nuclei to become bound to the sun .",
    "more detailed calculations of the capture rate can be found , e.g. , in @xcite . for a wimp mass of @xmath70 gev , the number of wimps in the sun will have reached equilibrium unless @xmath6@xmath71 or @xmath10@xmath72 .",
    "thus , the annihilation rate can be computed once the wimp mass @xmath51 , spin - dependent and spin - independent elastic scattering cross sections , the annihilation cross section , and the local halo wimp phase space density are known .",
    "in paper i , we described a set of simulations to determine the lifetimes and distribution function at the earth of wimps bound to the solar system by elastic scattering off solar nuclei . in order to understand how those quantities depend on wimp mass and elastic scattering cross section , we ran four sets of simulations , each with a different combination of wimp mass and elastic scattering cross section ( @xmath73 amu , @xmath6@xmath74 ; @xmath75 , @xmath6@xmath76 @xmath8 ; @xmath77 amu , @xmath6@xmath76 @xmath8 ; @xmath78 , @xmath6@xmath76 @xmath8 ) . in all cases , we set @xmath10@xmath79 in order to simplify the interpretation of the results , but in paper i , we describe how to extrapolate the results to regimes in which spin - dependent scattering dominates .",
    "we modeled the halo wimps as having a maxwellian velocity distribution in the galactocentric frame , setting the one - dimensional velocity dispersion to @xmath62 .",
    "we used the standard solar model described in @xcite to model the sun .",
    "scatters were treated in the `` cold sun '' approximation , in which the thermal speeds of the solar nuclei are neglected .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the wimp kinetic energy @xmath80 for any nuclear species @xmath29 , and the halo wimp speed @xmath81 .",
    "each simulation followed @xmath82 wimps from the initial time and location of the initial scatter by a solar nucleus of an unbound wimp onto a bound orbit .",
    "we followed the orbits using a symplectic integrator with an adaptive time step @xcite , with passages through the sun , close encounters with the planets , and nearly unbound orbits treated as special cases .",
    "the simulations allowed for the possibility of additional elastic scattering in the sun whenever the orbits traversed the solar interior . in order to more easily interpret the results of the simulation , we used a simplified solar system consisting only of the sun and jupiter .",
    "jupiter was placed on a circular orbit about the sun .",
    "this restricted three - body problem admits a constant of motion , the jacobi constant , which is a useful check on the accuracy of the integration code .",
    "typically , errors in the jacobi constant were oscillatory and no more than a few parts in @xmath83 at aphelion .",
    "the details of the integration scheme are given in paper i.    the integrations were terminated if the orbits met one of three conditions : ( i ) the wimp rescattered onto an orbit that was no longer earth - crossing .",
    "such orbits thermalize quickly in the sun , as discussed below , and hence were no longer relevant to our study of the wimp distribution function at the earth .",
    "( ii ) the particle was ejected from the solar system .",
    "( iii ) the wimp survived on an earth - crossing orbit for the entire lifetime of the solar system , @xmath84 .",
    "we use the lifetime distributions as a function of the semi - major axis of the wimp orbits to construct our argument below .",
    "the simulations offer insight into two possible mechanisms that may affect the annihilation rate in the sun : the finite time required to thermalize wimps in the sun , and changes to wimp trajectories due to gravitational interactions with bodies in the solar system other than the sun .",
    "the former would be relevant even if the sun were an isolated body , while the latter depends on the presence of planets in the system .",
    "we show that both suppress the annihilation rate by an amount that increases with increasing wimp mass , and the suppression is stronger for spin - dependent than spin - independent interactions at fixed wimp mass .      in the standard picture of wimp annihilation",
    ", it is assumed that wimps thermalize with solar nuclei on very short timescales . in the absence of planets , the time for a particle to rescatter after it becomes bound to the solar system is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is",
    "the wimp orbital period and @xmath87 is the optical depth for one passage through the sun .",
    "the thermalization time is @xmath88 , where the factor @xmath89 , which we will estimate later in this section , depends on the wimp mass . if @xmath90 is longer than the age of the solar system @xmath91 , the particles do not thermalize in the sun , and the annihilation rate of wimps in the sun essentially vanishes . to find the regions in wimp parameter space",
    "for which @xmath92 , we consider how the thermalization time depends on both the wimp cross section and mass .",
    "the thermalization time depends on the wimp - baryon cross section through the optical depth @xmath87 , which is proportional to the cross section @xmath93 . in our simulations",
    "@xmath94 corresponds to @xmath95 , the exact value of which depends on the trajectory of the wimp through the sun .",
    "we find that for a fixed cross section , @xmath96 ( the exact value depends weakly on mass , for reasons described in paper i ) , so that it takes a much higher spin - dependent cross section to reach an equivalent optical depth as a spin - independent cross section .",
    "this is because ( i ) hydrogen is the only species in the sun with an appreciable spin - dependent capture probability , and ( ii ) even though there are only trace amounts of metals ( with nucleon number @xmath97 ) in the sun ( @xmath98 of the total mass ) , the spin - independent cross section per nucleus goes as @xmath99 ( this is only moderately suppressed due to incoherent scattering ) .",
    "therefore , for a fixed wimp - proton cross section , the rescattering time is much longer if spin - dependent interactions dominate in the sun rather than spin - independent interactions .",
    "the wimp thermalization time depends on @xmath51 through several different effects . as @xmath51 increases",
    ", the momentum transfer in an elastic scattering event corresponds to a smaller velocity change in the wimp .",
    "it thus becomes more difficult to scatter halo wimps onto bound orbits .",
    "those that are scattered onto bound orbits will have larger ( less negative ) orbital energy and hence longer orbital periods . in the case of spin - dependent scattering , the median semi - major axis for @xmath100 is @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 is the radius of the sun and @xmath103 ) , @xmath104 for @xmath105 , and @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "if spin - independent scattering dominates in the sun , the median scattered semi - major axis is @xmath108 for @xmath100 , @xmath109 for @xmath105 , and @xmath104 for @xmath107 .",
    "the median semi - major axis is well approximated by @xmath110 for both spin - independent and spin - dependent scattering .",
    "typically , @xmath111 for spin - independent scattering and @xmath112 for spin - dependent scattering .",
    "since kepler s third law states that @xmath113 , we find that the median wimp orbital period goes as @xmath114 .",
    "once the wimp becomes bound to the solar system , the number of scatters required to thermalize a wimp increases with increasing mass , hence increasing @xmath89 , the ratio of the thermalization time to the rescattering time . to estimate @xmath89 , we consider the typical amount of energy lost in each scatter . in an inertial frame",
    "moving with the target nucleus ( in the cold sun approximation , this is just the heliocentric frame ) , the wimp loses an energy @xmath115 per scatter , where @xmath116 is the reduced mass of the wimp - nucleus system , @xmath117 is the speed of the wimp relative to the nucleus , and @xmath118 is the center - of - mass scattering angle . for a high mass wimp , @xmath119 ,",
    "so the typical wimp energy loss is @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the local escape speed from the sun ( @xmath122 at the surface of the sun , and is @xmath123 that value at the center of the sun ) . for",
    "now , we approximate scatters as occurring at points in the sun where the escape velocity is not too different from that at the surface .",
    "one can express the energy loss in terms of a semi - major axis , using @xmath124 solving for @xmath125 , we find @xmath126 where we have used the fact that @xmath127 .",
    "if a wimp had a semi - major axis @xmath128 prior to scatter , its post - scatter semi - major axis @xmath129 can be described by @xmath130 we find @xmath131 and hence the change in semi - major axis per scatter is @xmath132    we can define a differential equation for the shrinking of the semi - major axis with time , @xmath133 where we have used @xmath134 as the time between scatters , and where we have expressed @xmath135 in au and @xmath136 in years .",

    "we use @xmath140 because we consider scatters that occur near @xmath102 , and because for semi - major axes much smaller than this , the thermal speeds of the nuclei ( which we ignore here ) become important .",
    "we restrict @xmath89 to be strictly greater than unity , since an integer number of scatters is required to thermalize a wimp . setting @xmath129 a factor of ten higher changes @xmath89 by only a few percent .",

    "[ fig : frac ] , we show the those crossing fractions for the initial distribution of captured wimps for both spin - independent and spin - dependent interactions .",

    "throughout this work , we have considered a stripped - down solar system with jupiter as the only planet .",
    "we now ask how the above discussion is changed by the inclusion of the other planets in our solar system .",
    "the presence of the other planets may affect the results above if they either ( i ) change the lifetimes for each population of wimp ( @xmath166 , @xmath260 , and @xmath178 ) or ( ii ) if they introduce new classes of wimp populations .",
    "given the following arguments , it is unlikely that the presence of other planets will affect either the lifetimes or the classification of wimp orbits enough for the annihilation rate to be much different from those calculated in section [ sec : insight ] .",
    "first , we consider jupiter - crossing wimps , with @xmath261 .",
    "since jupiter is by far the most massive planet in the solar system , it largely sets the ejection timescale of wimps from the solar system .",
    "thus , the population of @xmath261 wimps should be largely unaffected by the presence of the other planets .",
    "wimps with @xmath262 could be affected if either the resonance structure is significantly altered ( recall that the long - lived population owes its survival to both mean - motion and secular resonances ) or if there is a significant probability that _ most _ wimps of a given initial semi - major axis will experience a strong encounter with an inner planet .",
    "the planets other than jupiter are not likely to affect the secular resonance structure for the highly eccentric orbits that originate in the sun .",
    "simulations of near - earth asteroid orbits show that changes to the resonance structure due to the all non - jupiter planets are only important if the orbits are initially circular , at low inclination , and have semi - major axes quite near those of either the earth or venus @xcite .",
    "however , wimps captured in the sun will generically have very high eccentricities if they cross the orbits of the inner planets , so it is likely that jupiter still dominates the resonance structure for most orbits .    to estimate the importance of close planetary encounters",
    ", we treat interactions as local and describe changes in the wimp semi - major axis using a random - walk approximation .",
    "this treatment may not be a good description for the scattering of wimps on resonances , since such wimps may either be protected from @xcite or have much stronger interactions with planets than predicted in the diffusion approximation .",
    "however , this argument will supply some rough interaction timescales .",
    "we consider inner planet encounters to have a significant impact on wimp lifetimes only if the resulting rms change to the wimp semi - major axis @xmath263 .    if we approximate the encounters to be local , the typical change to the wimp speed @xmath264 in an inertial frame moving with planet @xmath265 is @xmath266 for an impact parameter @xmath267 .",
    "since the wimp orbits are highly eccentric , the heliocentric velocity @xmath268 of the wimp is nearly orthogonal to the heliocentric velocity of the planet @xmath269 ( since the inner planets are on nearly circular orbits ) unless the wimp semi - major axis @xmath270 , so that @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the square of the planet s orbital speed",
    ". therefore , in heliocentric coordinates , the change to the wimp s speed is @xmath273 the change in semi - major axis in each encounter is @xmath274 since the wimp s energy @xmath275 .",
    "the rms change to the semi - major axis is @xmath276 where @xmath25 is the number of encounters with impact parameter @xmath277 . to determine @xmath25",
    ", we estimate that a wimp has a probability @xmath278 ( the solid angle subtended by a sphere of radius @xmath267 centered on the planet , as seen from the center of the sun ) of having an encounter with impact parameter @xmath277 during each wimp orbital period @xmath86 . therefore ,",
    "if we consider the wimp for a time @xmath136 , the total number of encounters in this time is @xmath279 here , we have neglected the coulomb logarithm @xmath280 , which is of order @xmath281 . using this factor , and combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : delta_a][eq : nt ] ) , we find that @xmath282    let us consider the time for @xmath283 for each of the inner planets . for mercury , @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "thus , for a wimp with @xmath286 , it takes @xmath287 yr for the wimp semi - major axis to change significantly . for venus and earth , @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "the timescale for significant changes to a wimp orbit with an initial semi - major axis of @xmath290 is of order @xmath291 yr .",
    "mars has a smaller mass ( @xmath292 ) and larger semi - major axis ( @xmath293 ) than the earth , so the timescale for wimp orbits to change due to encounters with mars is much longer than from interactions with the earth or venus .",
    "all of these timescales are longer than the age of the solar system , the maximum time for which we consider wimp orbits , so it is unlikely that a large number of wimps with @xmath262 have thermalization properties that are different from those discussed in section [ sec : insight ] .",
    "now that we have mapped out the annihilation rate suppression in wimp parameter space , it is possible to determine how serious the suppression may be for current and future neutrino telescopes . for this discussion , we only consider changes to limits on @xmath10@xmath11 since ( i ) we showed in section [ sec : insight ] that there is comparatively little suppression to the annihilation rate if spin - independent interactions dominate in the sun and ( ii ) given existing limits on @xmath6 , current and planned neutrino telescopes can not detect wimp annihilation in the sun driven by spin - independent scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "first , we consider the existing limits on @xmath10@xmath11 from the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite . in the analysis of their data ,",
    "neutrino oscillations were neglected but limits on the cross section were otherwise derived using fairly conservative assumptions for a supersymmetric wimp .",
    "the most stringent limit on the cross section came for @xmath294 , @xmath10@xmath295 @xcite . for larger masses ,",
    "the limit on @xmath10@xmath11 scales as @xmath51 because ( i ) for such cross sections , the annihilation rate will have reached equilibrium , and so @xmath296 ; and ( ii ) the number of neutrinos produced in a single wimp annihilation event scales approximately as @xmath51 @xcite . from fig . [",
    "fig : param ] in the previous section , it appears unlikely that the limit on @xmath10@xmath11 from super - kamiokande is greatly suppressed .",
    "if @xmath10@xmath297 were right at the flux limit for @xmath298 , most wimps on jupiter - crossing orbits would be ejected before rescattering ; however , only @xmath299 are jupiter - crossing . from fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] , we see that for wimps with higher masses , even jupiter - crossing wimps should thermalize , so the annihilation rate of wimps in the sun should be well - described by section [ sec : std ] .",
    "next - generation neutrino telescopes are anticipated to have @xmath300 times the sensitivity of super - kamiokande to neutrinos from wimp annihilation in the sun @xcite .",
    "if we were to naively scale the limits on @xmath10@xmath297 from super - kamiokande to km@xmath0-scale experiments , we would find @xmath10@xmath301 for @xmath100 and @xmath10@xmath302 for @xmath107 .",
    "in reality , from section [ subsec : map ] , we find that the limits on @xmath10@xmath297 should be weaker by a factor of @xmath303 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : frac ] ) .",
    "alternatively , this means that the next - generation neutrino experiments will be sensitive to a smaller range of @xmath10@xmath297 than currently predicted by the experimental collaborations .",
    "the restriction is only significant ( a change in the limit by @xmath304 ) if @xmath305 .",
    "it should be noted that the interpretation of an observed neutrino flux , or any attempt to map the observed flux to an elastic scattering cross section , will need to include the effects of the annihilation branching fractions and neutrino oscillation @xcite .",
    "these latter effects may complicate the estimate of the annihilation rate in the sun .",
    "_ supersymmetry _ : even in limited scans of the mssm , it is apparent that a large range of @xmath10is allowed , up to @xmath10@xmath306 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that mssm neutralino annihilation may be observed with next - generation neutrino telescopes ( e.g. , antares , icecube ) .    _ universal extra dimensions _ : in the minimal version of this model ( only one extra dimension ) , @xmath10@xmath307@xmath6 , so we consider only the prospects for observing neutrinos if spin - dependent interactions dominate the capture rate of wimps in the sun .",
    "the expected spin - dependent cross section goes as @xcite @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the fractional mass difference between the wimp ( the kaluza - klein photon ) and the kaluza - klein quark . in order to satisfy relic abundance requirements , @xmath252 , although the exact lower limit depends on boundary terms in the ued lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath310@xmath10parameter space straddles the line between cases ( a2 ) and ( a3 ) from section [ subsec : map ] , and also straddles the critical number equilibrium timescale , @xmath311 . both the high wimp escape fraction and the possibility that the number of wimps in the sun is not in equilibrium drive the annihilation rate down if @xmath247 .",
    "it would take a telescope with at least an order of magnitude more sensitivity than icecube to detect even the kaluza - klein photon with the best prospects for detection .",
    "_ little higgs _ : as in ued models , @xmath10@xmath307@xmath6 , so again we consider only the prospects of finding neutrinos from wimps captured in the sun by spin - dependent interactions @xcite . in little higgs models with @xmath53-parity ,",
    "the natural scale for the heavy photon , the wimp in this model , is @xmath312 , and the spin - dependent cross section scales with mass as @xmath313 where @xmath309 is the fractional mass difference between the heavy photon and the @xmath53-odd quark @xcite . for a fiducial case of @xmath314 , @xmath10@xmath315 for @xmath100 and @xmath10@xmath316 for @xmath317 . in the former case , the number of wimps in the sun will marginally be in equilibrium , and the suppression due to wimp populations with @xmath222 will be negligible .",
    "one would still require @xmath5 times the sensitivity of icecube to detect such a wimp . in the latter case ,",
