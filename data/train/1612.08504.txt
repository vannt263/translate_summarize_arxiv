    "innovation and technological change have been described by many scholars as the main drivers of economic growth as in @xcite and @xcite . @xcite advertised the use of patents as an economic indicator and as a good proxy for innovation .",
    "subsequently , the easier availability of comprehensive databases on patent details and the increasing number of studies allowing a more efficient use of these data ( e.g.  @xcite ) have opened the way to a very wide range of analysis .",
    "most of the statistics derived from the patent databases relied on a few key features : the identity of the inventor , the type and identity of the rights owner , the citations made by the patent to prior art and the technological classes assigned by the patent office post patent s content review .",
    "combining this information is particularly relevant when trying to capture the diffusion of knowledge and the interaction between technological fields as studied in @xcite . with methods such as citation dynamics",
    "modeling discussed in  @xcite or co - authorship networks analysis in  @xcite , a large body of the literature such as  @xcite or  @xcite has studied patents citation network to understand processes driving technological innovation , diffusion and the birth of technological clusters .",
    "finally , @xcite look at the dynamics of citations from different classes to show that the laser / ink - jet printer technology resulted from the recombination of two different existing technologies .",
    "consequently , technological classification combined with other features of patents can be a valuable tool for researchers interested in studying technologies throughout history and to predict future innovations by looking at past knowledge and interaction across sectors and technologies .",
    "but it is also crucial for firms that face an ever changing demand structure and need to anticipate future technological trends and convergence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to adapt to the resulting increase in competition discussed in  @xcite and to maintain market share .",
    "curiously , and in spite of the large number of studies that analyze interactions across technologies  @xcite , little is known about the underlying `` innovation network '' ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this monograph",
    ", we propose an alternative classification based on semantic network analysis from patent abstracts and explore the new information emerging from it .",
    "in contrast with the regular technological classification which results from the choice of the patent reviewer , semantic classification is carried automatically based on the content of the patent abstract . although patent officers are experts in their fields , the relevance of the existing classification is limited by the fact that it is based on the state of technology at the time the patent was granted and can not anticipate the birth of new fields .",
    "in contrast we do nt face this issue with the semantic approach .",
    "the semantic links can be clues of one technology taking inspiration from another and good predictors of future technology convergence ( e.g.  @xcite study semantic similarities from the whole text of 326 us - patents on _ phytosterols _ and show that semantic analysis have a good predicting power of future technology convergence ) .",
    "one can for instance consider the case of the word _",
    "optic_. until more recently , this word was often associated with technologies such as photography or eye surgery , while it is now almost exclusively used in a context of semi - transistor design and electro - optic .",
    "this semantic shift did not happen by chance but contains information on the fact that modern electronic extensively uses technologies that were initially developed in optic .",
    "previous research has already proposed to use semantic networks to study technological domains and detect novelty .",
    "@xcite was one of the first to enhance this approach with the idea of visualizing keywords network illustrated on a small technological domain .",
    "the same approach can be used to help companies identifying the state of the art in their field and avoid patent infringement as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more closely related to our methodology ,  @xcite develop a method based on patent semantic analysis of patent to vindicate the view that this approach outperform others in the monitoring of technology and in the identification of novelty innovation .",
    "semantic analysis has already proven its efficiency in various fields , such as in technology studies ( e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) and in political science ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    building on such previous research",
    ", we make several contributions by fulfilling some shortcomings of existing studies , such as for example the use of frequency - selected single keywords .",
    "first of all , we develop and implement a novel fully - automatized methodology to classify patents according to their semantic abstract content , which is to the best of our knowledge the first of its type .",
    "this includes the following refinements for which details can be found in section [ keywords ] : ( i ) use of multi - stems as potential keywords ; ( ii ) filtering of keywords based on a second - order ( co - occurrences ) relevance measure and on an external independent measure ( technological dispersion ) ; ( iii ) multi - objective optimization of semantic network modularity and size .",
    "the use of all this techniques in the context of semantic classification is new and essential from a practical perspective .",
    "furthermore , most of the existing studies rely on a subsample of patent data , whereas we implement it on the full us patent database from 1976 to 2013 . this way , a general structure of technological innovation can be studied .",
    "we draw from this application promising qualitative stylized facts , such as a qualitative regime shift around the end of the 1990s , and a significant improvement of citation modularity for the semantic classification when comparing to the technological classification .",
    "these thematic conclusions validate our method as a useful tool to extract endogenous information , in a complementary way to the technological classification .",
    "finally , the statistical model introduced in section [ statisticalmodel ] seems to indicate that patents tend to cite more similar patents in the semantic network when fitted to data . in particular , this propensity is shown to be significantly bigger than the corresponding propensity for technological classes , and this seems to be consistent over time .",
    "on the account of this information , we believe that patent officers could benefit very much from looking at the semantic network when considering potential citation candidates of a patent in review .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ data ] presents the patent data , the existing classification and provide details about the data collection process .",
    "section [ keywords ] explains the construction of the semantic classes .",
    "section [ result ] tests their relevance by providing exploratory results .",
    "finally , section [ discussion ] discusses potential further developments and conclude .",
    "more details , including robustness checking , figures and technical derivations can be found in  .",
    "in our analysis , we will consider all utility patents granted in the united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) from 1976 to 2013 .",
    "a clearer definition of utility patent is given in  .",
    "also , additional information on how to correctly exploit patent data can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each uspto patent is associated with a non - empty set of technological classes and subclasses .",
    "there are currently around 440 classes and over 150,000 subclasses constituting the united state patent classification ( uspc ) system .",
    "while a technological class corresponds to the technological field covered by the patent , a subclass stands for a specific technology or method used in this invention .",
    "a patent can have multiple technological classes , on average in our data a patent has 1.8 different classes and 3.9 pairs of class / subclass . at this stage ,",
    "two features of this system are worth mentioning : ( i ) classes and subclasses are not chosen by the inventors of the patent but by the examiner during the granting process based on the content of the patent ; ( ii ) the classification has evolved in time and continues to change in order to adapt to new technologies by creating or editing classes",
    ". when a change occurs , the uspto reviews all the previous patents so as to create a consistent classification .      as with scientific publications , patents must give reference to all the previous patents which correspond to related prior art .",
    "they therefore indicate the past knowledge which relates to the patented invention . yet ,",
    "contrary to scientific citations , they also have an important legal role as they are used to delimit the scope of the property rights awarded by the patent .",
    "one can consult  @xcite for more details about this .",
    "failing to refer to prior art can lead to the invalidation of the patent ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another crucial difference is that the majority of the citations are actually chosen by the examiners and not by the inventors themselves . from the uspto",
    ", we gather information of all citations made by each patent ( backward citations ) and all citations received by each patent as of the end of 2013 ( forward citations ) .",
    "we can thus build a complete network of citations that we will use later on in the analysis .    turning to the structure of the lag between the citing and the cited patent in terms of application date",
    ", we see that the mean of this lag is 8.5 years and the median is 7 years .",
    "this distribution is highly skewed , the @xmath0 percentile is 21 years .",
    "we also report 164,000 citations with a negative time lag .",
    "this is due to the fact that some citations can be added during the examination process and some patents require more time to be granted than others .    in what follows ,",
    "we choose to restrict attention to pairs of citations with a lag no larger than 5 years .",
    "we impose this restriction for two reasons .",
    "first , the number of citations received peaks 4 - 5 years after application .",
    "second , the structure of the citation lag is necessarily biased by the truncation of our sample : the more recent patents mechanically receive less citations than the older ones . as we are restricting to citations received no later than 5 years after the application date",
    ", this effect will only affect patents with an application date after 2007 .",
    "each patent contains an abstract and a core text which describe the invention .",
    "form at https://patents.google.com .",
    "] although including the full core texts would be natural and probably very useful in a systematic text - mining approach as done in  @xcite , they are too long to be included and thus we consider only the abstracts for the analysis . indeed , the semantic analysis counts more than 4 million patents , with corresponding abstracts with an average length of 120.8 words ( and a standard deviation of @xmath1 ) , a size that is already challenging in terms of computational burden and data size .",
    "in addition , abstracts are aimed at synthesizing purpose and content of patents and must therefore be a relevant object of study ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the uspto defines a guidance stating that an abstract should be `` a summary of the disclosure as contained in the description , the claims , and any drawings ; the summary shall indicate the technical field to which the invention pertains and shall be drafted in a way which allows the clear understanding of the technical problem , the gist of the solution of that problem through the invention , and the principal use or uses of the invention '' ( pct rule 8) .",
    "we construct from raw data a unified database .",
    "data is collected from uspto patent redbook bulk downloads , that provides as raw data ( specific ` dat ` or ` xml ` formats ) full patent information , starting from 1976 .",
    "detailed procedure of data collection , parsing and consolidation are available in  .",
    "the latest dump of the database in ` mongodb ` format is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/dvn/bw3ack collection and homogenization of the database into a directly usable database with basic information and abstracts was an important task as uspto raw data formats are involved and change frequently .",
    "we count 4,666,365 utility patents with an abstract granted from 1976 to 2013 .",
    "the number of patents granted each year increases from around 70,000 in 1976 to about 278,000 in 2013 .",
    "when distributed by the year of application , the picture is slightly different .",
    "the number of patents steadily increase from 1976 to 2000 and remains constant around 200,000 per year from 2000 to 2007 . restricting our sample to patent with application date ranging from 1976 to 2007 , we are left with 3,949,615 patents .",
    "these patents cite 38,756,292 other patents with the empirical lag distribution that has been extensively analyzed in  @xcite . conditioned on being cited at least once , a patent receives on average 13.5 citations within a five - year window .",
    "270,877 patents receive no citation during the next five years following application , 10% of patents receive only one citation and 1% of them receive more than 100 citations .",
    "a within class citation is defined as a citation between two patents sharing at least one common technological class . following this definition , 84% of the citations are within class citations .",
    "14% of the citations are between two patents that share the exact same set of technological classes .",
    "potentialities of text - mining techniques as an alternative way to analyze and classify patents are documented in  @xcite .",
    "the author s main argument , in support of an automatic classification tool for patent , is to reduce the considerable amount of human effort needed to classify all the applications .",
    "the work conducted in the field of natural language processing and/or text analysis has been developed in order to improve search performance in patent databases , build technology map or investigate the potential infringement risks prior to developing a new technology ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "text - mining of patent documents is also widely used as a tool to build networks which carry additional information to the simplistic bibliographic connections model as argued in  @xcite . as far as the authors know",
    ", the use of text - mining as a way to build a global classification of patents remains however largely unexplored .",
    "one notable exception can be found in  @xcite where semantic - based classification is shown to outperform the standard classification in predicting the convergence of technologies even in small samples .",
    "semantic analysis reveals itself to be more flexible and more quickly adaptable to the apparition of new clusters of technologies .",
    "indeed , as argued in  @xcite , before two distinct technologies start to clearly converge , one should expect similar words to be used in patents from both technologies .",
    "finally , a semantic classification where patents are gathered based on the fact that they share similar significant keywords has the advantage of including a network feature that can not be found in the uspc case , namely that each patent is associated with a vector of probability to belong to each of the semantic classes ( more details on this feature can be found in section [ characteristics ] ) . using co - occurrence of keywords",
    ", it is then possible to construct a network of patents and to study the influence of some key topological features .",
    "in this section , we describe methods and empirical analysis leading to the construction of semantic network and the corresponding classification .",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of patents , we first assign to a patent @xmath3 a set of potentially significant keywords @xmath4 from its text @xmath5 ( that corresponds to the concatenation of its own title and abstract ) .",
    "@xmath4 are extracted through a similar procedure as the one detailed in  @xcite :    1 .",
    "text parsing and tokenization : we transform raw texts into a set of words and sentences , reading it ( parsing ) and splitting it into elementary entities ( words organized in sentences ) .",
    "part - of - speech tagging : attribution of a grammatical function to each of the tokens defined previously .",
    "stem extraction : families of words are generally derived from a unique root called stem ( for example ` compute ` , ` computer ` , ` computation ` all yield the same stem ` comput ` ) that we extract from tokens . at this point",
    "the abstract text is reduced to a set of stems and their grammatical functions .",
    "multi - stems construction : these are the basic semantic units used in further analysis .",
    "they are constructed as groups of successive stems in a sentence which satisfies a simple grammatical function rule .",
    "the length of the group is between 1 and 3 and its elements are either nouns , attributive verbs or adjectives .",
    "we choose to extract the semantics from such nominal groups in view of the technical nature of texts , which is not likely to contain subtle nuances in combinations of verbs and nominal groups .",
    "text processing operations are implemented in ` python ` in order to use built - in functions ` nltk ` library  @xcite for most of above operations .",
    "this library supports most of state - of - the - art natural language processing operations .",
    "[ [ relevance - definition ] ] relevance definition + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    following the heuristic in  @xcite , we estimate relevance score in order to filter multi - stem . the choice of the total number of keywords to be extracted @xmath6 is important , too small",
    "a value would yield similar network structures but including less information whereas very large values tend to include too many irrelevant keywords .",
    "we choose to set this parameter to @xmath7 .",
    "we first consider the filtration of @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) to keep a large set of potential keywords but still have a reasonable number of co - occurrences to be computed .",
    "this is done on the _ unithood _ @xmath10 , defined for keyword @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the multi - stem s number of apparitions over the whole corpus and @xmath14 its length in words .",
    "a second filtration of @xmath6 keywords is done on the _ termhood _ @xmath15 .",
    "the latter is computed as a chi - squared score on the distribution of the stem s co - occurrences and then compared to a uniform distribution within the whole corpus .",
    "intuitively , uniformly distributed terms will be identified as plain language and they are thus not relevant for the classification .",
    "more precisely , we compute the co - occurrence matrix @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is defined as the number of patents where stems @xmath11 and @xmath18 appear together .",
    "the _ termhood _",
    "score @xmath15 is defined as    @xmath19    [ [ moving - window - estimation ] ] moving window estimation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the previous scores are estimated on a moving window with fixed time length following the idea that the present relevance is given by the most recent context and thus that the influence vanishes when going further into the past .",
    "consequently , the co - occurrence matrix is chosen to be constructed at year @xmath20 restricting to patent which applied during the time window @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "note that the causal property of the window is crucial as the future can not play any role in the current state of keywords and patents .",
    "this way , we will obtain semantic classes which are exploitable on a @xmath22 time span .",
    "for example , this enables us to compute the modularity of classes in the citation network as in section [ citationmodularity ] . in the following ,",
    "we take @xmath23 ( which corresponds to a five year window ) consistently with the choice of maximum time lag for citations made in section [ sub : citation ] .",
    "accordingly , the sensitivity analysis for @xmath24 can be found in appendix  .",
    "we keep the set of most relevant keywords @xmath25 and obtain their co - occurrence matrix as defined in section [ keywords_est ] .",
    "this matrix can be directly interpreted as the weighted adjacency matrix of the semantic network . at this stage",
    ", the topology of raw networks does not allow the extraction of clear communities .",
    "this is partly due to the presence of hubs that correspond to frequent terms common to many fields ( e.g. ` method ` , ` apparat ` ) which are wrongly filtered as relevant .",
    "we therefore introduce an additional measure to correct the network topology : the concentration of keywords across technological classes , defined as :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the number of occurrences of the @xmath28th keyword in each of the @xmath18th technological class taken from one of the @xmath29 uspc classes .",
    "the higher @xmath30 , the more specific to a technological class the node is .",
    "for example , the terms ` semiconductor ` is widely used in electronics and does not contain any significant information in this field .",
    "we use a threshold parameter and keep nodes with @xmath31 . in a similar manner ,",
    "edge with low weights correspond to rare co - occurrences and are considered as noise : we filter edges with weight lower than a threshold @xmath32 , following the rationale that two keywords are not linked `` by chance '' if they appear simultaneously a minimal number of time . to control for size effect , we normalize by taking @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of patents in the corpus ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "communities are then extracted using a standard modularity maximization procedure as described in  @xcite to which we add the two constraints captured by @xmath32 and @xmath36 , namely that edges must have a weight greater than @xmath32 and nodes a concentration greater than @xmath36 . at this stage , both parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 are unconstrained and their choice is not straightforward .",
    "indeed , many optimization objectives are possible , such as the modularity , network size or number of communities .",
    "we find that modularity is maximized at a roughly stable value of @xmath32 across different @xmath36 for each year , corresponding to a stable @xmath37 across years , which leads us to choose @xmath38 .",
    "then for the choice of @xmath36 , different candidates points lie on a pareto front for the bi - objective optimization on number of communities and network size , among which we take @xmath39 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : networksensitivity ] ) .     for different @xmath36 values .",

    "can also be extended using newly developed techniques of hyper - network analysis .",

    "first of all , the presence of mass in small probabilities for semantic but not technological diversity confirms that the semantic classification contains patent spread over a larger number of classes .",
    "more interestingly , a general decrease of diversity for complicated patents , both for semantic and technological classification systems , can be interpreted as an increase in invention specialization .",
    "this is a well - known stylized fact as documented in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a qualitative regime shift on semantic classification occurs around 1996 . this can be seen whether or not we include patents with zero diversity .",

    "this means that on the one hand the number of single class patents begins to increase and on the other hand complicated patents do not change in diversity .",

    "although difficult to interpret directly , this stylized fact clearly unveils a change in the _ nature _ of inventions , or at least in the relation between content of inventions and technological classification . as the tipping point is at the same time as the ones observed in the previous section and",
    "since the two statistics are different , it is unlikely that this is a mere coincidence .",
    "thus , these observations could be markers of a hidden underlying structural changes in processes .",
    "an exogenous source of information on relevance of classifications is the citation network described in section [ sub : citation ] .",
    "the correspondence between citation links and classes should provide a measure of accuracy of classifications , in the sense of an external validation since it is well - known that citation homophily is expected to be quite high ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this section studies empirically modularities of the citation network regarding the different classifications . to corroborate the obtained results , we propose to look at a more rigorous framework in section [ statisticalmodel ] .",
    "modularity is a simple measure of how communities in a network are well clustered ( see @xcite for the accurate definition ) .",
    "although initially designed for single - class classifications , this measure can be extended to the case where nodes can belong to several classes at the same time , in our case with different probabilities as introduced in @xcite .",

    "modularity is an aggregated measure of how the network deviates from a null model where links would be randomly made according to node degree . in other words",
    "it captures the propensity for links to be inside the classes .",
    "overlapping modularity naturally extends simple modularity by taking into account the fact that nodes can belong simultaneously to many classes .",
    "we document in fig .",
    "[ fig : modularities ] both simple and multi - class modularities over time .",
    "for simple modularity , @xmath99 is low and stable across the years whereas @xmath100 is slightly greater and increasing .",
    "these values are however low and suggest that single classes are not sufficient to capture citation homophily .",
    "multi - class modularities tell a different story .",
    "first of all , both classification modularities have a clear increasing trend , meaning that they become more and more adequate with citation network .",
    "the specializations revealed by both patent level diversities and classes overlap is a candidate explanation for this growing modularities .",
    "secondly , semantic modularity dominates technological modularity by an order of magnitude ( e.g. 0.0094 for technological against 0.0853 for semantic in 2007 ) at each time .",
    "this discrepancy has a strong qualitative significance .",
    "our semantic classification fits better the citation network when using multiple classes . as technologies",
    "can be seen as a combination of different components as shown by  @xcite , this heterogeneous nature is most likely better taken into account by our multi - class semantic classification .          in this section ,",
    "we develop a statistical model aimed at quantifying performance of both technological and semantic classification systems .",
    "in particular , we aim at corroborating findings obtained in section [ citationmodularity ] . the mere difference between this approach and the citation modularity approach lies in the choice of the underlying model , and the according quantities of interest .",
    "in addition for the semantic approach , we want to see if when restricting to patents with higher probabilities to belong to a class , we obtain better results . to do that , we choose to look at within class citations proportion ( for both technological and semantic approaches ) .",
    "we provide two obvious reasons why we choose this .",
    "first , the citations are commonly used as a proxy for performance as mentioned in section [ citationmodularity ] .",
    "second , this choice is `` statistically fair '' in the sense that both approaches have focused on various goals and not on maximizing directly the within class proportion . nonetheless , the within class proportion is too sensitive to the distribution of the shape of classes .",
    "for example , a dataset where patents for each class account for 10% of the total number of patents will mechanically have a better within class proportion than if each class accounts for only 1% .",
    "consequently , an adequate statistical model , which treats datasets fairly regardless of their distribution in classes , is needed .",
    "this effort ressembles to the previous study of citation modularity , but is complementary since the model presented here can be understood as an elementary model of citation network growth .",
    "furthermore , the parameters fitted here can have a direct interpretation as a citation probability .",
    "we need to introduce and recall some notations .",
    "we consider a specific window of observations @xmath101 $ ] , and we define @xmath51 the number of patents which appeared during that time window .",
    "we let @xmath102 their corresponding appearance date by chronological order , which for simplicity are assumed to be such that @xmath103 . for each patent",
    "@xmath52 we consider @xmath104 the number of distinctive couples \\{cited patent , cited patent s class } made by the @xmath11th patent ( for instance if the @xmath11th patent has only made one citation and that the cited patent is associated with three classes , then @xmath105 ) .",
    "let @xmath70 , we define @xmath106 the number of patents associated to at least one of the @xmath11th classes at time @xmath107 . for @xmath108",
    "we consider the variables @xmath109 , which equal @xmath61 if the cited patent s class is also common to the @xmath11th patent .",
    "we assume that @xmath109 are independent of each other and conditioned on the past follow bernoulli variables @xmath110 where the parameter @xmath111 indicates the propensity for any patent to cite patents of its own technological or semantic class . when @xmath112 , the probability of citing patents from its own class is simply @xmath113 , which corresponds to the observed proportion of patents which belong to at least one of the @xmath11th patent s classes .",
    "thus this corresponds to the estimated probability of citing one patent if we assume that the probability of citing any patent @xmath114 is uniformly distributed , which could be a reasonable assumption if classes were assigned randomly and independently from patent abstract contents .",
    "conversely if @xmath115 , we are in the case of a model where there are 100% of within class citations . a reasonable choice of @xmath116 lies between those two extreme values .",
    "finally , we assume that the number of distinctive couples @xmath104 are a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables following the discrete distribution @xmath117 , and also independent from the other quantities .",
    "we estimate @xmath116 via maximum likelihood , and obtain the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) @xmath118 .",
    "the likelihood function , along with the standard deviation expression and details about the test , can be found in  .",
    "the fitted values , standard errors and p - values corresponding to the statistical test @xmath119 ( with corresponding alternative hypothesis @xmath120 ) on non - overlapping blocks from the period 1980 - 2007 are reported on table [ summary ] .",
    "semantic values are reported for four different chosen thresholds @xmath121 .",
    "it means that we restricted to the couples ( @xmath11th patent , @xmath18th class ) such that @xmath122 .",
    "the choice of considering non - overlapping blocks ( instead of overlapping blocks ) is merely statistical .",
    "ultimately , our interest is in the significance of the test over the whole period 1980 - 2007 .",
    "thus , we want to compute a global p - value . this can be done considering the local p - values ( by local , we mean for instance computed on the period 2001 - 2005 ) assuming independence between them .",
    "this assumption is reasonable only if the blocks are non - overlapping .",
    "all of this can be found in  .",
    "finally , note that from a statistical perspective , including overlapping blocks would nt yield more information .",
    "the values reported in table [ summary ] are overwhelmingly against the null hypothesis .",
    "the global estimates of @xmath123 are significantly bigger than the estimate of @xmath124 for all the considered thresholds .",
    "although the corresponding p - values ( which are also very close to 0 ) are not reported , it is also quite clear that the bigger the threshold , the higher the corresponding @xmath123 is estimated",
    ". this is consistently seen for any period , and significant for the global period .",
    "this seems to indicate that when restricting to the couples ( patent , class ) with high semantic probability , the propension to cite patents from its own class @xmath123 is increasing .",
    "we believe that this might provide extra information to patent officers when making their choice of citations .",
    "indeed , they could look first to patents which belong to the same semantic class , especially when patents have high probability semantic values .",
    "note that the introduced model can be seen as a simple model of citations network growth conditional to a classification , which can be expressed as a stochastic block model ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "a utility patent at the uspto is a document providing intellectual property and protection of an invention .",
    "it excludes others to making , using , or selling the invention the same invention in the united states in exchange for a disclosure of the patent content .",
    "the protection is granted for 20 years since 1995 ( it was 17 years before that from 1860 ) starting from the year the patent application was filled , but can be interrupted before if its owner fails to pay the maintenance fees due after 3.5 , 7.5 and 11.5 years .",
    "utility patents are by far the most numerous , with more than 90% of the total universe of uspto patents .",
    "according to the title 35 of the united states codes ( 35 usc ) section 101 : _ _ `` whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , or any new and useful improvement thereof , may obtain a patent therefor , subject to the conditions and requirements of this title . '' _ _ in practice however , other types of invention including algorithms can also be patented .",
    "the two following sections of the 35 usc defined the condition an invention must meet to be protected by the uspto : ( i ) novelty : the claimed invention can not be already patented or described in a previous publication ( 35 usc section 102 ) ; ( ii ) obviousness : _ `` differences between the claimed invention and the prior art must not be such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains''_. ( 35 usc section 103 ) .",
    "after review from the uspto experts , an application satisfying these requirements will be accepted and a patent granted .",
    "the average time lag for such a review is on average a little more than 2 years since 1976 , with some patents being granted after much more than two years .",

    "the choice of the year 2007 is due to the truncation bias : we only want to use information on granted patents and we get rid of all patents that were rejected by the uspto .",
    "however , in order to date them as closely as possible to the date of invention , we use the application date as a reference . as a consequence ,",
    "as we approach the end of the sample , we only observe a fraction of the patents which have been granted by 2013 .",
    "looking at the distribution of time lag between application and grant in the past and assuming that this distribution is complete in time , we can consider that data prior to 2007 are almost complete and that data for 2007 are complete up to 90% .",
