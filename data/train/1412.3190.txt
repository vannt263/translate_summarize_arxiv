    "we see in figure  [ fig : exp13_phivsz_all](a ) that the profiles are more extended as the field increases .",
    "this is expected due to the onset of the formation of string - like clusters of particles , which we already saw in figure  [ fig : exp13_xz ] .",
    "one can also calculate the equation of state by simultaneously obtaining the local volume fraction @xmath26 in thin slices @xmath27 at height @xmath7 , parallel to and above the bottom substrate and the local osmotic pressure @xmath28 as a function of field strength is shown in figure  [ fig : exp13_phivsz_all](b ) @xcite .",
    "we can see that the zero field equation of state ( eos ) for @xmath29 pmma particles shows excellent agreement with what is expected for a hard - sphere eos from the carnahan - starling relation , and is in agreement with careful experiments in true bulk ( non - microscopy ) systems  @xcite .",
    "this shows that our system is an excellent hard - sphere system , at least in the dilute regime which is of interest here .",
    "while the packing fraction range for these experiments is low , it has been seen in previous work that deviation from hard - sphere - like behaviour , for example due to a soft particle shell , manifests itself in a larger effective particle diameter _ even at low concentrations_. for example , in the work of li _ et al _ @xcite , which was a silica in water - dmso colloidal system where the void phase was observed @xcite , the eos could only be fit by assuming an effective particle diameter that was 20% larger than the measured value .",
    "we can also obtain the osmotic pressure from the sedimentation profiles at non - zero fields ; this is shown in figure  [ fig : exp13_phivsz_all](b ) .",
    "we note that the osmotic pressure obtained is only universally valid for single particles and small chains because the effective peclet number increases quickly with the size of the structure ; we thus refer to it as an _ apparent _ osmotic pressure @xmath30 .",
    "it is nevertheless a useful quantity because the intra - chain structure is the result of both gravitational force and free thermal exchange of particles when @xmath2 is o(1 ) . at non - zero fields (",
    "i.e. with increasing @xmath2 ) , the key observation is that @xmath30 at any given packing fraction @xmath24 is larger than the hard - sphere value , and increases with the field .",
    "this is in contrast with experiments ( li _ et al _ @xcite ) where the dipoles were perpendicular to gravity , where @xmath30 at a given @xmath24 decreased with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "pressure in a fluid is isotropic .",
    "apparently _ anisotropic osmotic pressure perhaps arises from our definition of the local volume fraction .",
    "while the mean volume fraction decreases continuously with @xmath7 , as shown in figure  [ fig : exp13_phivsz_all](a ) , the particles in any given slice along the @xmath6-@xmath31 plane are not homogenously distributed : there is clustering , so the true local volume fraction is higher than the mean value .",
    "thus we next focus on the properties of the clusters .",

    "( b ) distribution of lateral size ( in units number of chains ) corresponding to the slice above at @xmath32 . electric field and gravity point into the page ( i.e. along @xmath7 ) .",
    "clusters of size 2 and larger become more frequent for the higher fields .",
    ", width=604 ]    figure  [ fig : cluster](a ) shows clusters a height of @xmath33 above the bottom substrate . there is a distribution :",
    "there are several individual chains , doublets , triplets , and elongated multi - chain clusters . at zero field ( the black points in figure  [ fig : cluster](b ) ) , there are single - particles and some two - particle clusters",
    ". these are not real clusters .",
    "since a cluster is defined simply by proximity ( @xmath34 ) , the probability of unassociated two - particle clusters is not zero .",
    "on the other hand , as the field is increased , the probability of size 2 , 3 , and larger clusters increases systematically above the zero - field value ; this represents real in - plane clustering ( along @xmath35 ) of chains ( along @xmath7 ) .",
    "evidence of clustering can also be obtained from `` sedimentation - diffusion '' profiles where we measure the lateral ( in - plane ) self - diffusion coefficient @xmath36 ( over a few seconds , which is already in the long - time limit for single - particle motion ) as a function of distance @xmath7 from the substrate . at zero field , the diffusion coefficient @xmath36 saturates to the bulk value @xmath37 when @xmath7 is greater than 50 @xmath38 .",
    "we can utilize the diffusion profiles in figure  [ fig : diffall](a ) and the sedimentation profiles in figure  [ fig : exp13_phivsz_all](a ) to obtain the diffusion coefficient as a function of the volume fraction @xmath24 : this is shown in figure  [ fig : diffall](b ) . for both particle sizes , the relation has the form @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "this is comparable to the range -2.8 to -2.9 obtained in experiments by blees _",
    "et al _ @xcite and de kruif _ et al . _",
    "@xcite but different from the theoretical value of -2.1 obtained by batchelor @xcite .",
    "this shows that the density gradient imposed for our experiments does not affect the hydrodynamics , because we get essentially the bulk experimental value for long - time diffusion .",
    "we next examine the effect of a field in different regions of the sediment . at position",
    "a in figure  [ fig : diffall](c ) , substrate effects are strong , and increasing the field slows the dynamics significantly due to the formation of chain clusters - this can already be seen at the lowest fields , e.g. in the second row of figure  [ fig : exp13_xz ] . at position",
    "b ( @xmath41 in figure  [ fig : diffall](c ) ) , the diffusion coefficient decreases from @xmath42 to @xmath43 as the field increases from zero to e = 1667 v / mm . at high fields ,",
    "there is a plateau for @xmath36 versus @xmath7 , which is an indicator that all particles are associated with chain - like clusters . at intermediate fields",
    "( e = 1000 and 1167 v / mm ) the dynamics is intermediate between the high - field plateau and the zero field value , which signals the end of a chain - like cluster and the beginning of the diffuse particle region seen in figure  [ fig : exp13_xz ] .",
    "this is also seen in figure  [ fig : diffall](d ) ( top panel ) , corresponding to @xmath44 m ( position b ) where sharp clusters are seen at the highest fields , and in time averages of the movies ( bottom panel ) , where the particle dynamics smear the intensities at lowest fields , but the clusters are still visible at highest fields , suggesting particles stay confined to their respective clusters . at intermediate fields ,",
    "the time average ( bottom panel , middle ) is more diffuse than the snapshot ( top panel , middle ) , but the clusters are still visible , indicating that the dynamics is also intermediate between free `` particle '' and cluster `` particle '' ( note that the particles referred to here are chains along @xmath7 ) . at e = 1333 v / mm , the plateau extends to position c , while at 1500 v / mm , it extends further to position d , and even further at higher fields ; i.e. the width of the plateau in the sedimentation - diffusion ( @xmath36 versus @xmath7 ) profile increases with field , which is consistent with the increase in chain lengths with increasing field , seen in figure  [ fig : exp13_xz ] .",
    "we compare these behaviours for the two particle sizes in figure [ fig : diffall](e ) .",
    "while the 0.8 @xmath15 m particles exhibit a plateau at approximately @xmath45 and at @xmath46 1 , the 1 @xmath15 m particles only show the emergence of a plateau at @xmath46 2 . at these larger dipolar strengths ,",
    "the dynamics is slower , and @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath36 versus @xmath7 plateau is interesting .",
    "a possible picture for its existence is that particles that are associated with a chain are diffusing in the presence of a local potential well binding it to the chain cluster .",
    "another interesting aspect , seen in figure  [ fig : diffall](d ) ( bottom panel ) is that increasing the field effectively increases the strength of the lateral confinement .",
    "the current experiments have not probed large - scale motions on very long times , which requires also tracking the colloids in 3 dimensions .",
    "a systematic study of particle dynamics as a function of this confinement would be an interesting subject for future work .     for a range of field strengths from @xmath48 to @xmath49 of 0.8@xmath9 diameter pmma colloids in 70:30 decalin / tce .",
    "at zero field , diffusion coefficients ( for both monodisperse systems ( @xmath50 pmma in 60:40 decalin / tce and @xmath51 pmma in 70:30 decalin / tce ) ( a ) increase towards the bulk value with increasing height , and ( b ) decrease ( linearly ) with local volume fraction @xmath24 , yielding both the diffusion coefficient at infinite dilution @xmath52 and the hydrodynamic factor @xmath53 .",
    "( c ) the diffusion coefficient varies with height @xmath7 due to effects of varying concentration as well as wall effects .",
    "( d ) snapshots ( top panel ) from movies taken at three different fields at @xmath44 m , corresponding to position b in ( c ) show the onset of clustering .",
    "the time - averaged intensities ( bottom panel ) show that particles are much more dynamic at low fields , while they are confined to chain clusters at high fields ( see text ) .",
    "( e ) a plateau emerges at @xmath3 in the value of scaled diffusion coefficients for both monodisperse systems plotted against the dimensionless @xmath54.,width=604 ]    finally , we can assess the magnitude of the dipolar strength at the transition from single particles to clusters . for the chain - cluster ( or `` string fluid '' ) structure",
    ", the hard - sphere - plus - dipolar model @xcite predicts that at packing fractions less @xmath55 , the string fluid exists without showing clear body - centred tetragonal ( bct ) crystallinity .",
    "all the structures seen at the low packing fractions of our current experiments show no crystallinity . in the simulations ,",
    "chain clusters form at @xmath56 ( note that @xmath57 in the simulations @xcite corresponds to 2@xmath2 ) , in the experiments at @xmath3 .",
    "experiment and the hard - sphere - plus - dipolar model are thus ( at least qualitatively ) in agreement .",
    "the results reported here now enable more detailed statistical comparisons to the hard - sphere - plus - dipolar model .",
    "in addition , figure [ fig : diffall ] shows the scaled diffusion coefficient for both particle sizes , plotted against the height ( scaled with the gravitational length ) .",
    "it is seen that the transition from single particles to clusters ( i.e. the emergence of the lower plateau at approximately @xmath45 ) occurs at a dipolar strength @xmath2 that is close to 1 for both particle sizes ( dotted and solid blue curves , referring to 0.8 and 1 @xmath15 m spheres respectively ) .",
    "this again suggests that a pure - dielectric dipolar interaction is a dominant contributor to the interactions .",
    "in this work , we have examined brownian colloidal systems where the equation of state is shown to be in quantitative agreement with the hard - sphere equation of state , even in a thin sediment , and with no use of `` effective '' particle sizes .",
    "in addition , the hydrodynamic corrections to the diffusion coefficient at finite volume fractions are well captured by the batchelor form for hard spheres .",
    "thus , @xmath15m - scale colloids in a solvent mixture of decahydronapthalene and tetrachloroethylene are hard - sphere - like , density- and refractive - index - matchable , and yet have a strong enough dipolar inter - particle interaction in the presence of an external field .",
    "we used sedimentation - diffusion profiles , in zero field , to obtain self - diffusion coefficients as a function of volume fraction @xmath24 .",
    "the colloidal systems exhibited a decrease in self - diffusion coefficient with increasing @xmath24 that was consistent with bulk experiments for hard - sphere colloids .",
    "next , we applied external electric fields .",
    "the `` hard - sphere - plus - dipolar '' equation of state ( eos ) is obtained : the _ apparent _ osmotic pressure at any given volume fraction @xmath24 is found to be greater than the hard - sphere value . it should be noted that , in the presence of clustering , the true local volume fraction is larger than the mean value at a particular height , so the eos must be taken with a pinch of salt ; however , we reiterate the observation in the raw sedimentation profiles that the profiles are more extended with higher fields .",
    "we characterized the onset of field - induced interactions by sedimentation - diffusion profiles .",
    "the deviation from zero field profiles occurs at @xmath3 ( see table  [ tab : lambda ] ) .",
    "stable anisotropic clusters form which are long along the field direction , but have a modest lateral extent .",
    "the peak in lateral size of clusters shifts to larger values with increasing field strength . at low fields ,",
    "the self - diffusion coefficient increases steadily with height above the substrate @xmath7 . at a dipolar strength of order unity , an interesting plateau develops develops in the @xmath36 vs @xmath7 profile .",
    "snapshots of the clusters in this plateau region show well defined chain - like clusters indicating that the dynamics here corresponds to the internal dynamics of a ( wagging or breathing ) chain cluster .",
    "the length of the plateau correlates with the length of the chain clusters .",
    "the lateral extent of chain - chain clusters increases with the dipolar strength .",
    "this is unsurprising , but the nature of the clusters is interesting : the clusters are thicker for @xmath58-diameter particles than for @xmath59-diameter particles , as can be seen even by a visual inspection of figure  [ fig : exp13_xz ] . also apparent here is that clusters are thickest in bidisperse suspensions , suggesting a synergistic effect of bidispersity .",
    "this apparent synergy likely arises because particle bidispersity works to the break the registry between adjacent chains .    for context ,",
    "two close - to - brownian colloidal systems used in optical microscopy in which dipolar colloidal interactions have been previously employed are either at peclet numbers of order 10 , or not true hard - sphere systems . in the first system , silica microspheres in aqueous suspensions @xcite , the particles are typically twice as dense as the medium , resulting in peclet numbers ( for micron - sized colloids ) of order 10 . in the second system , pmma colloids in a mixture of decalin and cyclohexyl bromide ( `` dec - chb '' ) @xcite ,",
    "the peclet numbers are low , but the interactions can at best be described as `` hard - sphere - like '' with an effective hard - sphere diameter that is @xmath60 10 to 15% larger than the measured diameter .",
    "the present system is thus a useful find , as such a system can make closer contact with computer simulations ; we thus recommend this system as an appropriate model system for precise comparisons of experiments and simulations of hard - sphere - plus - dipolar colloids .",
    "finally , an interesting aspect of the cluster state might have relevance to the low - density networking forming `` void '' phase , which are seen in experiments @xcite but not in simulations @xcite . while the intra - chain structure is thermal at dimensionless dipolar strengths @xmath3",
    ", the dynamics of chain - chain clusters on large ( time and length ) scales is likely to be non - brownian .",
    "simulations of dipolar colloids in the presence of gravity would shed light on this matter .",
    "the system used is a colloidal suspension of pmma colloids in a cis - trans - decahydronaphthalene ( decalin ) and tetrachloroethylene ( tce ) solvent .",
    "two particle diameters were used in the experiments . for both particle diameters ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 m )",
    ", the solvent mixture was adjusted to volume ratios of 60:40 and 70:30 of decalin to tce respectively ( table  [ tab : data ] ) so that the density mismatch yielded a gravitational length much greater than the particle diameter , @xmath63 m .",
    "density match of the pmma microspheres and the medium could be achieved with a 50:50 cis - trans decahydronapthalin ( decalin ) / tetrachloroethylene ( tce ) solvent mixture ; in this case the gravitational length , @xmath64 was significantly larger than the sample thickness .",
    "the @xmath61 and @xmath62 m particles are dyed with 4-methylaminoethylmethacrylate-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol ( nbd ) and 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ( diic18 ) respectively , and excited by 490 nm ( blue ) and 561 nm ( green ) laser lines . in the binary mixture , while the emission from the green excitation comes purely from the @xmath62 m particles , the emission from the blue excitation also has a small contribution from the 1.0 and @xmath62 m particles .",
    "shown in table  [ tab : data ] are the relevant parameters for confocal microscopy , density and refractive index , as well as the relevant parameter for electric field studies , the dielectric constant .",
    "the dielectric constant is roughly constant between dc and 1 mhz ( ac ) but very different at optical frequencies , hence it is feasible to have optical match but electrical mismatch between particles and solvent mixture .",
    "it should be noted that van der waals attractions can be reduced , but by no means made to disappear , simply by matching refractive index .",
    "for all the electric - field cells , the top and bottom plates were 22 mm square cover slips coated with a transparent conducting layer of indium tin oxide ( ito ) .",
    "these cover slides were glued together ( with norland optical epoxy noa 68 ) with two sets of 50 @xmath15 m polyethylene terephthalate films placed in between as spacers to give a sample thickness of 100 @xmath15 m .",
