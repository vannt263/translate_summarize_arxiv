    "given a graph @xmath1 with @xmath2 and a collection of edge lengths @xmath3 , a euclidean embedding of @xmath4 in @xmath0 is a mapping of its vertices to a set of points @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 , for all @xmath7 .",
    "we call a graph ( generically ) rigid in @xmath0 iff , for generic edge lengths , it can be embedded in @xmath0 in a finite number of ways , modulo rigid transformations ( translations and rotations ) .",
    "a graph is minimally rigid in @xmath0 iff it is no longer rigid once any edge is removed .",
    "the study of rigid graphs is motivated by numerous applications , mostly in robotics , mechanism and linkage theory , structural bioinformatics , and architecture .",
    "the main goal is to determine the maximum number of distinct planar euclidean embeddings of minimally rigid graphs , up to rigid transformations , as a function of the number of vertices .",
    "we shall focus on the planar case .",
    "a general upper bound on the number of embeddings , for the planar case , is @xmath8 .",
    "the bound was obtained by exploiting results from complex algebraic geometry that bound the degree of ( symmetric ) determinantal varieties defined by distance matrices @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "( cf . section 1.2 ) also yield an upper bound of @xmath9 , for the planar case .    in the table below we can see the lower and upper bounds we know @xcite for the maximum number of embeddings of rigid graphs with up to @xmath10 vertices .",
    "the most recent tight bound is for @xmath11 @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for example , these are the 9 h2-graphs with 7 vertices .",
    "the second one has 56 embeddings ( the upper bound for @xmath11 ) .",
    "we see that , in total , there are 608 rigid graphs with 8 vertices and from them , the 499 are h1-graphs .",
    "since two circles intersect generically in two points , a h1-step at most doubles the number of embeddings and this is tight .",
    "it follows that a h1-graph on @xmath12 vertices has @xmath13 embeddings .",
    "therefore , the 499 graphs have @xmath14 embeddings , which is smaller than the lower bound we have ( 112 ) .",
    "from the remaining 109 graphs , 77 have a vertex of degree 2 , which means that they have at most @xmath15 embeddings , because 56 is the maximum number of embeddings of a graph with 7 vertices .    therefore , there are only 32 graphs to consider .",
    "the five marked graphs ( in the above drawing with some bold edges ) have at most 64 embeddings .",
    "the marked graphs can be constructed by combining two smaller rigid graphs .",
    "more specifically , we can take the rigid graph with 4 vertices and combine it with a rigid graph with 5 vertices in a way that they have a common vertex , and we add one more edge so that the whole construction is rigid .",
    "the resulting graph is isomorphic with one of the above marked graphs and moreover , it has at most @xmath16 embeddings , because there are 4 embeddings for the rigid graph with 4 vertices , 8 embeddings for the graph with 5 vertices and the additional edge allows only 2 embeddings for each combination : we consider a cycle ( blue cycle in the figure below ) with center a vertex of the rigid subgraph with 4 vertices and we have to count its intersections with a specific vertex ( red vertex ) of the second rigid subgraph with 5 vertices .",
    "there are 2 such intersections because the latter vertex moves on a circle ( orange circle ) centered at the common vertex of the two rigid subgraphs ( see the figure below )",
    ".        therefore , we focus on the remaining 27 graphs .",
    "we can associate every graph with a cayley - menger matrix @xcite , which is a matrix like the following :          for every graph we construct the corresponding cayley - menger matrix . we know that the number of embeddings of a graph is equal to the number of completions of the above matrix that have rank 4 .",
    "this means that all the 5x5 minors that correspond to cayley - menger sub - matrices vanish , therefore we have a polynomial system with @xmath19 equations and @xmath20 unknowns .    for every system ( one for each graph )",
    ", we will find a square subsystem with finite number of roots and for which if the unknown lengths are fixed , they uniquely define the configuration of the overall graph ; this is the approach in @xcite .",
    "we now introduce a powerful algebraic tool , namely the mixed volume of a well - constrained polynomial system ; see , e.g. , @xcite for definitions and an efficient algorithm for its computation .",
    "the mixed volume of the square subsystem of minors is an upper bound on the number of its complex roots , hence it bounds the number of embeddings of the graph .",
    "more specifically , this bound does not take into account solutions with zero coordinates , since it counts toric complex roots .",
    "however , a graph has embeddings with some zero length only when the input bar lengths form a singular set , in the sense that they would satisfy a non - generic algebraic dependency .",
    "for example , by letting some input distance be exactly 0 , some graph may theoretically have infinitely many configurations .",
    "however , generically , it is impossible to have such an embedding , as discussed in @xcite .    for the above matrix",
    ", the following 6x6 subsystem has a finite number of solutions , mixed volume equal to 116 , and it uniquely defines the configuration of the overall graph . let @xmath21 $ ] denote the principal minor of the matrix indexed by the rows / columns in @xmath22 and the first row / column of ones .",
    "we see that there are only two graphs which exceed the lower bound we know ( 112 ) , and they have at most 116 embeddings .",
    "this proves that a rigid graph with 8 vertices can have at most 116 embeddings ( we also expect that this bound is tight )",
