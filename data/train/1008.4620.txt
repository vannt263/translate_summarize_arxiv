    "although the dark energy that is responsible for the present cosmic acceleration is known to occupy more than @xmath3 of the energy budget of the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its nature is still shrouded in deep mystery . the simplest candidate for the dark energy",
    "is the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) that einstein introduced in his field equation a century ago and called _ the fundamental constant of nature _",
    "@xcite , which has been interpreted as the vacuum energy that is completely homogeneous in space , does not evolve with time , non - interacting , chemically inert , and has a constant equation of state ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .    over the past two decades ,",
    "the cosmologists have witnessed and enjoyed the practical success of the @xmath0cdm ( cosmological constant + cold dark matter ) cosmology in explaining the large - scale properties of the universe , which have left little doubt on the validity of the @xmath0cdm as a standard model . nevertheless , an increasing number of literatures have been devoted to seeking for viable alternatives that could compete with and hopefully replace the @xmath0cdm ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the main motivation of the alternative dark energy models is to explain naturally the cosmic coincidence that the densities of dark energy and dark matter have the same order of magnitude of unity , which issue the standard @xmath0cdm is incapable of addressing @xcite .",
    "an intriguing idea that was motivated by a fundamental particle physics and has gained a lot of popularity recently in the field of large scale structure is that dark energy is a scalar field having a non - minimal coupling with dark matter ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the distinct feature of this fascinating idea is that a possible fifth force can be generated by the propagation of dark matter inhomogeneities into the scalar field due to the non - minimal coupling .",
    "the strength , range and potential form of a possible fifth force depends on how to model the coupling in the dark sector ( dark energy+dark matter ) .",
    "the reason for the recent sharp attention on the coupled scalar field models is that the inclusion of a fifth force generated by the dark sector interaction may be able to explain several observational phenomena @xcite , which have been suggested as mismatches to the theoretical predictions of the @xmath0cdm cosmology such as the abundance of galaxy satellites , the speed of bullet cluster , and the clear - out of void dwarfs @xcite .    in this letter , we present another observable that exhibits an obvious mismatch with the numerical prediction based on the standard structure formation based on a @xmath0cdm cosmology : the misalignments between matter and galaxy distributions in triaxial galaxy clusters . in conventional approaches",
    "the shapes of dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters were often determined by measuring the member galaxy distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent progress in weak lensing shear analysis , however , has allowed us to determine the shapes of clusters directly from dark matter distributions @xcite , which has revealed that the cluster dark matter distributions are only very weakly aligned with the cluster galaxy distributions .",
    "noting that the standard structure formation model based on @xmath0cdm cosmology predicts very strong correlations between the shapes of galaxy and dark matter distributions @xcite , we make a quantitative comparison between the observed trend and the @xmath0cdm - based prediction , and make a robust test of the hypothesis that the observed trend is consistent with the @xmath0cdm - based prediction with the help of the bootstrap resampling and generalized @xmath1 statistics .",
    "we speculate that the observed misalignments between dark matter and galaxy distributions in triaxial clusters might be a new observational signature of a dark sector interaction .",
    "the correlations between the major axes of dark matter and satellite galaxy distributions in dark halos have been investigated by @xcite using the data from the mili - millennium simulation that was run on a periodic box size of @xmath4mpc for a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the dark halos and their substructures were identified from the mili - millennium data by applying the friends - of - friends ( fof ) and the subfind algorithm , respectively @xcite .",
    "the luminosities of the satellite galaxies residing in the dark halo substructures were determined according to the semi - analytic model of galaxy formation @xcite . for a detailed description of the mili - millennium simulation and the semi- analytic galaxy catalog ,",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite .    selecting those mili - millennium halos which have five or more satellite galaxies , @xcite ended up having a sample of @xmath6 dark halos with mass @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "they determined the major axes of the selected @xmath6 halos using two different schemes .",
    "the first scheme is based on the dark matter distribution of each halo .",
    "they calculated the inertia momentum tensor of each halo using the constituent dark matter particles ( each of which has mass @xmath9 ) and determine the major axis as the eigenvector of the inertia momentum tensor corresponding to the largest eigenvalue . in the second scheme the major axis of the inertia momentum tensor of each halo was calculated by using the satellite galaxies weighted by their luminosity .",
    "the correlations between the major axes determined by the two different schemes were quantified in terms of the distribution of the alignment angle : basically , they measured the angle between the two major axes in range of @xmath10 $ ] for each halo .",
    "binning the alignment angles and counting the number of halos whose alignment angles belong to each bin , they calculate the number fraction distribution as a function of the angle between the two major axes of dark matter and satellite galaxy distributions ( see figure 1 in lee et al .",
    "very strong correlations between the two major axes were found , which proved that the satellite galaxies in the massive halos tend to be located near the major axes of the dark matter distributions .",
    "the correlations between matter and galaxy distributions in halos are usually ascribed to the effect of the external tidal fields : according to the cosmic web theory based on a cold dark matter paradigm @xcite , the coherence and non - linear sharpening of the gravitational tidal fields induce the shape - alignments between the large- scale structures such as cluster - supercluster alignments , void - supercluster alignments and the inclination of the galaxy spin axes onto the sheets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gravitational tidal effects also cause the galaxy clusters to have triaxial shapes and induce the correlations between matter and satellite galaxy distribution in the triaxial clusters since the merging and accretion of matter and galaxies onto the clusters occur preferentially along the primary filaments that are aligned with the directions of the minimal matter compression , i.e. , the minor principal axes of the gravitational tidal fields @xcite .",
    "after anisotropic merging along the primary filaments , however , the secondary infall and subsequent nonlinear evolution inside the clusters would modify the spatial distributions of the member galaxies @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite have shown that as the clusters become more relaxed , the correlations between the principal axes of dark matter and substructures tend to decrease .",
    "they also found that the correlations increase with redshift and cluster mass .    in observations ,",
    "the correlations between the major axes of dark matter and galaxy distributions are often measured in the two dimensional projected planes .",
    "therefore , for a direct comparison with the observational result , it is necessary to predict numerically the correlations of the projected major axes of dark matter and satellite galaxy distributions . adopting the same mili - millennium run data used by @xcite and assuming the flat - sky approximation , we investigate here the correlations between the projected major axes of dark matter and galaxy distributions . measuring and binning the angles @xmath11 of the projected major axes of dark matter and satellite galaxy distributions of the selected @xmath6 halos in the two dimensional plane",
    ", we find the number fraction of dark halos as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the left , middle and right panel of figure [ fig : theory ] plots the results for the case that the projection was done onto the xy , yz , and zx plane , respectively .",
    "the errors include both of the sample variance as well as the poisson noise .",
    "the sample variance is calculated as one standard deviation among the @xmath12 bootstrap resamples .",
    "as one can see , the distributions has a sharp peak at the first bin @xmath13 , as in the three dimensional case , which proves that projections onto the two dimensional planes do not diminish the correlations between the major axes of matter and satellite galaxy distributions . in the following section",
    ", we compare this numerical prediction with the observational result and test the hypothesis that the observational result is consistent with the numerical prediction based on a @xmath0cdm cosmology .      performing two dimensional analysis of the weak lensing shear maps constructed with high - quality subaru / supreme - cam @xcite , @xcite",
    "have measured the two dimensional projected shapes and orientations of dark matter distributions in the galaxy clusters from the local cluster substructure survey @xcite . using a subsample of @xmath14 galaxy clusters for which the weak lensing shear maps are well fitted to the elliptical density profiles @xcite",
    ", they determined the longest axis of the dark matter distribution and measured its position angle for each cluster ( see table 1 in oguri et al .",
    "2010 ) .    selecting those member galaxies",
    "whose r - band magnitudes are brighter than @xmath15 mag , they also fitted the member galaxy distribution ( confined to the same region ) in each cluster to an elliptical power law profile and determined the positions angle of the longest axis of galaxy distributions ( see table 2 in oguri et al .",
    "according to @xcite , the fitting of the dark matter and member galaxy distribution in each cluster was done at the square region @xmath16 , around cluster s center chosen to be the location of the brightest cluster galaxy , where @xmath17 corresponds to approximately @xmath18-@xmath19 mpc for the selected clusters in a redshift range of @xmath20 . for a detailed description of the two dimensional fitting of weak lensing shear field and the cluster sample , see @xcite .    by comparing the position angles of dark matter and galaxy distributions in each cluster , they found only very weak correlations between the two .",
    "they considered several possible systematics such as galaxy bias , dilution effect , fitting area and field - galaxy contamination but found no systematics significant enough to explain the observed trend .",
    "although @xcite asserted that the ellipticity distribution of dark matter distributions in the observed galaxy clusters agrees well with the theoretical prediction based on a @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite , they did not recognize that the observed misalignments between the longest axes of dark matter and member galaxy distributions in the clusters are inconsistent the @xmath0cdm prediction .    to make a parallel comparison of the observational result with the @xmath0cdm prediction given in  2 , here we determine the distributions of the angles @xmath11 between the projected major axes of dark matter and galaxy distributions using the observational data of the @xmath14 clusters given in @xcite .",
    "the angle @xmath11 for each cluster is determined by subtracting the position angle of the galaxy distribution from that of dark matter distribution and taking its absolute value . if the position angle difference exceeds @xmath21 , then we take @xmath22 .",
    "then , we bin the values of @xmath11 and count the number of the clusters belonging to each bin .",
    "figure [ fig : compare1 ] plots the result as open squares .",
    "the dotted line represents the uniform distribution corresponding to the case that there is no correlation between the major axes of dark matter and galaxy distributions .",
    "the errors include the sample variance and the poisson noise .",
    "as in  2 , the sample variance is calculated as @xmath23 scatter among the @xmath12 bootstrap resamples . for comparison , we also plot the numerical prediction of the @xmath0cdm cosmology obtained in  2 as thick solid line ( projection onto xy plane ) while the thin solid lines represent the @xmath24 bootstrap errors of the numerical results .    as it can be seen",
    ", the observational result deviates significantly from the numerical result based on a @xmath0cdm prediction and the semi - analytic galaxy formation model . to quantify the deviation",
    ", we employ the generalized @xmath1-statistics which accounts for the correlations between the neighbor @xmath11-bins due to the errors in the measurement of cluster s position angles : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the covariance matrix defined as @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the difference between the observed and predicted value of the cluster number fraction at the @xmath29-th bin given as @xmath30 .",
    "the bracket in the definition of @xmath26 ( equation [ eqn : chi2 ] represents the ensemble average over the @xmath12 bootstrap resamples .",
    "noting that in the large @xmath11 section ( beyond the third bins ) the poisson noises dominate over the bootstrap errors and the signals of the numerical results are confined to the first two bins , we consider the first three bins ( @xmath31 ) for the calculation of @xmath1 ( i.e. , the degree of freedom is @xmath19 ) .    putting the numerical results obtained in  2 into @xmath32 for the calculation of @xmath1 , we test the hypothesis that the observational result is consistent with the @xmath0cdm prediction and found that the hypothesis is rejected at the @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "meanwhile , putting the uniform distribution into @xmath32 , we also test the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the major axes of dark matter and galaxy distributions and have found that the null hypothesis is rejected only at the @xmath33 confidence level .    excluding those clusters whose position angles suffer from large uncertainties , we end up with a smaller subsample of @xmath34 clusters and redetermined the number fraction distribution as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig : compare2 ] plots the results .",
    "as it can be seen , the distribution has a higher peak at the second bin but still deviates significantly from the numerical result based on a @xmath0cdm cosmology and the semi - analytic galaxy formation model .",
    "the recalculation of @xmath1 for this case rejects the hypothesis that the observational result from the @xmath34 clusters is consistent with the numerical result is rejected at the @xmath35 confidence level .",
    "it is worth mentioning the differences in the redshift range between the numerical and observational data used for the above comparison : the numerical result has been obtained at @xmath8 while the observational results have been drawn from the galaxy clusters at @xmath36 .",
    "this difference in the redshift range , however , would even worsen the disagreement between the numerical and the observational result for the following reason . as mentioned in  2 and as shown by n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the correlations between the major axes of dark matter and satellite galaxy distributions tend to be stronger at higher redshifts .",
    "in other words , the predicted strength of the correlations used for the comparison with the observational result is underestimated .",
    "one might think that the selection bias in the measurements of galaxy distributions should be responsible for the disagreement between theory and observation since in the analysis of @xcite only those bright galaxies with @xmath37 at r - band are used unlike in the numerical analysis .",
    "recall , however , that we used the luminosity - weighted galaxy distributions in the numerical analysis to determine the major axes , which should minimize the expected selection bias .",
    "another difference lies in the values of the cosmological parameters used for the mili - millennium run simulations . especially , the value of @xmath38 chosen by the millennium run simulation has been known to be higher than the wmap value @xcite .",
    "the correlations between dark matter and satellite galaxy distributions in triaxial clusters , however , are unlike to be significantly affected by the initial cosmological conditions , since it represents a nonlinear observable rather than a linear one .",
    "now that we have found the observed misalignments of the projected major axes of dark matter and galaxy distributions in the galaxy clusters to be inconsistent with the numerical prediction based on a @xmath0cdm cosmology and the semi - analytic galaxy formation model , we would like to discuss the possible physical origin of the misalignments .",
    "a usual suspect would be some hydrodynamic gas physics involved in the galaxy formation that was not included in the millennium run simulation and semi - analytic galaxy catalog .",
    "if this is really the case , then our result indicates that the semi - analytic galaxy formation model has to be improved to account for the observed deviations of the orientations of cluster galaxy distributions relative to that of dark matter distributions .",
    "an intriguing new possibility is that the orientations of member galaxy distributions have deviated from that of dark matter distributions due to the existence of the fifth force that is non - zero only in massive halos . in some dark energy model where",
    "the scalar field is coupled both to the dark matter particles and the second relativistic particle species , a fifth force is short ranged , having non - zero values only on the scales smaller than the typical cluster sizes ( @xmath39mpc ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to recent simulation results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in these models with a local fifth force the cluster galaxies ( i.e. , the galactic halos in dense environments ) tend to form earlier and evolve more nonlinearly than in the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "in addition , a local fifth force also tend to affect the mutual interactions between the satellite galaxies , which would result in an internal tidal field different from the gravitational external tidal field . whereas , the dark matter particles which constantly accrete onto the host clusters at relatively later epochs than the member galaxies along the primary filaments from the surroundings would be less affected by the existence of a local fifth force and",
    "thus would keep the memory of the external gravitational tidal fields .",
    "overall , a fifth force would play a role of diminishing the expected strong alignments between dark matter and galaxy distributions in clusters .",
    "this new idea also suggests that it might be possible to constrain the range and strength of a local fifth force by measuring the misalignments between dark matter and galaxy distributions in clusters .",
    "this goal calls for making a quantitative prediction of the coupled dark energy model on the correlations between dark matter and galaxy distribution using detailed n - body and hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the millennium run simulation used in this paper was carried out by the virgo supercomputing consortium at the computing centre of the max - planck society in garching , which are available at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/millennium .",
