    "manipulating light at a distance away from its source is a key requirement in advancing light wave technologies , such as communication , imaging , and sensing . to enable such advances , various approaches are being devised , with an increasing interest in metamaterial structures ( see e.g. ,  @xcite for an historical overview ) .",
    "most of the work reported on light manipulation using metamaterial structures assumes local manipulation ( field is controlled inside the metamaterial or in its direct vicinity ) such transformation optics  @xcite and conformal mapping techniques  @xcite to perform operations that are usually not possible using conventional materials , such as analog computation  @xcite .",
    "recently , two - dimensional metamaterial surfaces , generally named metasurfaces , were introduced to shape wavefronts beyond what was possible using frequency selective surfaces .",
    "these metasurfaces found applications in the generalized law of refraction  @xcite , wavefront shaping virtual huygens sources  @xcite , and computational imaging  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the foundation for a general framework is established to manipulate light waves using metasurfaces .",
    "the proposed approach is based on the concept of light momentum conservation , and is therefor named the momentum transformation method .",
    "this method , although straightforward , presents a rigorous and systematic approach to manipulate light at distance with unprecedented flexibility and insight and , to the best of the authors knowledge , is not previously reported in the literature .",
    "in addition , the presented method provides the initial guidelines for metasurface synthesis with a physical insight into the light wave behavior .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec:2 ] derives the momentum transformation method , starting with the scalar case in sec .",
    "[ sec:2.1 ] , and generalizing to the vectorial case , using momentum space expansion vector basis functions , in  [ sec:2.2 ] .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] provides some guidelines for the metasurface realization in terms of its scattering elements in the momentum space .",
    "several illustrative examples for near - field and far - field manipulations are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:4.1 ] and sec .",
    "[ sec:4.2 ] , respectively .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] concludes the paper .",
    "since the momentum ( or the wavevector ) of light waves is conserved in homogenous media , a forced change in any of its components necessarily affects the other components in order to ensure total momentum conservation .",
    "hence , forcing local momentum changes in the @xmath0-space , should allow one , in principle , to reshape the light wave in a controlled fashion .",
    "the interaction between the metasurface and the fields is local in space , i.e. , the difference between the field at a certain point one side of the metasurface and the same point on the opposite side is solely determined by the metasurface transfer function at the same point .",
    "formal mathematical derivation is given in the appendix .",
    "the local interaction in the direct space translates into a convolution relation in the momentum space .",
    "although @xmath0-space manipulation is convolutional in nature , it allows for superior light manipulation at distance compared to direct space manipulation , as will be shown .",
    "metasurfaces thus emerge as best suited candidates for the momentum transformation since they can effectively manipulate the transverse components of the wavevector .",
    "the following sub - sections establish two approaches for momentum transformation . the first approach deals with scalar fields , such as acoustic fields and paraxially approximate fields encountered in optics .",
    "the second approach deals with vectorial fields and is therefore relevant to electromagnetic waves manipulation .      , the transmitted field @xmath1 , and the metasurface function @xmath2",
    "are plotted . in the lower part ,",
    "the corresponding momentum space quantities are plotted.,width=240 ]    in the scalar case for an infinitely thin metasurface , the interaction between the fields and the metasurface is local , i.e. , linear - shift variant .",
    "thus , for a metasurface located at @xmath3 in the cartesian coordinate system with the fields @xmath4 at @xmath5 and @xmath6 at @xmath7 , the linear - shift variant relation reads@xmath8where @xmath9 is suppressed , @xmath10 denotes the plane of the metasurface and @xmath11 is the generalized transfer function of the metasurface , which reduces to @xmath2 due to local interaction .",

    "relation  ( [ eq : lsv ] ) becomes a convolutional relation in the @xmath0-space reading @xmath15 .",
    "alternatively , this relation could be written to express the metasurface function explicitly as@xmath16where @xmath17 .",
    "this momentum relation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "equation   by itself does not offer much advantage over its direct space counterpart  , which is commonly used in optical applications .",
    "however , it could be argued though that the momentum space representation may offer a better insight into the dynamic range of momentum variation ( upper and lower bounds ) to be induced by the metasurface , and hence on the possibility to synthesize the metasurface with electromagnetic scattering elements .",
    "moreover , the actual advantage of the momentum space representation is evident when the transmitted field is required to be manipulated away from the metasurface . in order to manipulate the transmitted field at a distance @xmath18 away from the metasurface plane ,",
    "a reverse propagation operator is introduced .",
    "the role of the reverse propagator is to propagate the @xmath0-space components of @xmath19 from a given plane @xmath20 back to the metasurface plane at @xmath3 . in the scalar case ,",
    "the reverse propagator is a fourier propagator taking the form@xmath21inserting  ( [ eq : phi ] ) into  ( [ eq : scalar ] ) yields the complete momentum transformation equation@xmath22 \\ast \\tilde{\\zeta}\\left(k_x , k_y\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : smt}\\ ] ]    the function @xmath2 may be considered as a generalization of the optical transfer function ( otf )  @xcite for a metasurface , albeit without the limitations associated with the otf , such as normal incidence , large electrical size of the surface and ignoring reflection .",
    "alternatively , the otf may be considered as the high frequency approximation of @xmath2 .",
    "a vector field @xmath0-space basis function set must be chosen to extend the scalar transform to the vectorial transform .",
    "this set must satisfy the completeness and orthogonality conditions in order to enable the expansion of any vector field .",
    "this expansion allows for the scalarization of the vector problem in a fashion similar to mode matching techniques , where the mode index is the scalar quantity that relates the vector fields involved in the transformation .",
    "once the vector fields on both sides of the metasurface are properly expanded , the momentum transformation follows naturally .",

    "accordingly , the vector plane - wave set forms a momentum space basis set and could be used to expand any vector field in the vicinity of the metasurface .",
    "the corresponding transformation pair takes the form@xmath46 where @xmath45 may be considered as a continuous index for the momentum space modes .",
    "similar to the scalar case , the reverse propagator is given by@xmath47 where @xmath45 is directly specified in the vector case and prescribes the transverse wavevector components , in contrast to the scalar case , where @xmath45 is prescribed by the transverse wavevector components .",
    "this namely sets the momentum transformation approach for vector fields to be a mode matching approach without violating the wave equation . using the power orthogonality of the momentum space basis functions  ( [ eq : powerorthogonality ] ) , the fields in the vicinity of the metasurface are expanded and a momentum transformation relation is established as@xmath48 where the superscripts @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the expanded fields at @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively .    here , it should be noted that the vector nature of the problem introduces an extra level of complication , where the summation over @xmath45 must be taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , such complexity could be viewed as an extra degree of freedom , where the metasurface becomes a vector mode transformer in the @xmath0-space .",
    "metasurfaces are formally described as two - dimensional discontinuities in the electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "their reduced dimensionality grants them a great potential for controlling electromagnetic fields without the disadvantages of excessive loss , weight and fabrication difficulty associated with three - dimensional metamaterials  @xcite . in  @xcite , the modeling process is carried out by determining the susceptibility dyadics for given fields on both sides of the metasurface . here",
    ", the action of a metasurface is approached under the perspective of the transformation of the momentum of the incident field into that of the transmitted field .",
    "accordingly , metasurface synthesis is also approached under the perspective of light wave momenta , as opposed to susceptibilities .",
    "this means that the design of metasurface scattering elements directly relates their geometrical degrees of freedom to their effect on the wave momentum .",
    "modeling of metasurface elements might be analytical or numerical . in either case ,",
    "a set of scattering elements must be chosen such that their momentum response covers the range of momentum transformation of interest .",
    "this ensures that indeed the metasurface is capable of the required momentum transformation between the incident , reflected and transmitted fields .",
    "for this purpose , a set of basis scattering elements are chosen , such that their domain of degrees of freedom maps to the range of momentum change of interest .",
    "the mapping between the domain of degrees of freedom of an isolated scattering element to its action on the wavevector components is established by way of analytic modeling or full - wave simulation as done in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting maps are then used as lookup maps to identify the suitable element parameters for a specific transformation operation .",
    "the elements are then combined to form the complete metasurface .",
    "the construction of such lookup maps is beyond the scope of this paper , whose main objective is to establish the momentum transformation method , rather than providing implementation details .",
    "in this section , two types of momentum transformation related to field radiation at distance are demonstrated .",
    "the first type is manipulation in the fresnel ( near - field ) region , and the second is manipulation in the fraunhofer ( far - field ) region .",
    "conventionally , each radiation region is associated with different dominant field behaviors , for instance , in the fresnel region , the physical geometry of the metasurface is identifiable and has thus a direct impact on the field distribution , whereas in the fraunhofer region , the metasurface is assumed to be far enough such that its geometry is indistinguishable .      in the fresnel region ,",
    "diffraction patterns typically significantly differ from that observed at large distance ( infinity ) away from the source , and vary significantly with the observer position with respect to the source . in this region , all ( polarized ) field components have to be taken into account and non - radiative field components are expected to exist .",
    "two examples of field manipulation in the fresnel region are presented .",
    "the first example is the conversion of an incident gaussian beam into a vortex hypergeometric - gaussian beam , and the second is the generation of a `` delayed - start '' accelerating airy beam from an incident plane - wave .",
    "hypergeometric - gaussian ( hyg ) beams are a class of paraxial waves solutions with a complex amplitude that is proportional to a confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "the beam intensity profile is characterized by a single brilliant ring with the field amplitude vanishing at its center .",
    "hyg beams carry topological charges , i.e. their phasefronts are helical , and thus have a singular phase profile . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "hyg beams describe the eigenfunctions of the photon orbital angular momentum , and since they carry orbital angular momentum , they are of interest in applications , such as micro- and nano - particle manipulation and orbital angular momentum multiplexing  @xcite .    the hyg beam field is defined as@xmath51^{1+|m|/2+p/2 } }   e^{i m \\phi - i \\chi } { } _ 1f_1 \\left(-\\frac{p}{2},|m|+1;\\frac{\\chi \\left",

    "hyg beams are unstable below the rayleigh range , @xmath61 , meaning that one mode can degenerate into others .",
    "hence it is of interest to generate the hyg beam directly beyond the rayleigh range in order to avoid the inherent beam instability . in this example , the hyg beam is generated by illuminating the metasurface by an ordinary gaussian beam,@xmath62 - i \\vartheta\\left(z\\right )   \\right),\\]]where @xmath63 , @xmath64 $ ] is the beam radius of curvature , @xmath65^{1/2}$ ] is the beam waist with @xmath54 the beam waist at @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the gouy phase .",

    "the purpose of the propagator here is to generate the hyg beam at the plane of the metasurface with the characteristics of a hyg at @xmath68 , thus avoiding the instability region of the beam .",

    "the first example is the generation of a pencil beam , and the second is the demonstration of a holographic repeater , where the source field is reconstructed at a remote distance .",
    "a pencil beam is a beam of electromagnetic radiation in the form of a narrow cone .",
    "antennas which are strongly directive in both azimuth and elevation , such as phased array antennas , are often used to generate pencil beams . however , such phased array antennas suffer from several disadvantages including the need for complex and expensive components and circuitry . alternatively , resorting to the super gain concept  @xcite , the same pencil beam may be , in principle , achieved by an antenna with a single feed . in conventional antennas , however , super gain demands rapid current variations along the antenna structure , which severely limits the realizability due to huge ohmic loss and excessive tolerance sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "metasurfaces offer a decisive advantage in the generation of pencil beams , since they do not require variable actual current sources . accordingly , super gain is achievable using momentum transformation without the issues encountered in conventional super gain antennas .",
    "metasurface implementations offer great flexibility since the amount of induced momentum variation by any individual scattering element may be determined independent from its neighboring elements .",
    "the physical limitation in the case of metasurface implementation is the requirement that the size of the metasurface scattering element has to be considerably smaller than the operational wavelength .",

    "an additional level of flexibility follows from the synthesis process , which does not require prior knowledge of field distributions at any intermediate distance between the metasurface and the destination plane .",
    "finally , synthesizing metasurfaces based on momentum transformation is a rigorous , systematic and unified approach for treatment of all cases of wave manipulation at distance .",
