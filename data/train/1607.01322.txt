    "[ fig_spectra](b ) ] , _ i.e. , _ by a much larger number of autocorrelation functions than at a fixed photoelectron energy .",
    "this would not only make the analysis more complicated , but would also strongly suppress the contrast , since many autocorrelation functions are time - independent .",

    ", the time - resolved photoelectron probability can be connected to the electronic wave - packet state at the time of ionization by the probe pulse .",

    "we assume that the pump pulse launches a coherent electronic wave packet by creating an electron hole in a superposition of homo , homo-1 and homo-2 of indole ; the probe pulse has the same parameters as in the previous section .",
    "the characteristic time scale of electron dynamics is now determined by the largest energy splitting among the eigenstates of the wave packet , which is the energy difference between the homo-2 and homo orbitals of 2.7 ev within the koopmans theorem .",
    "thus , the shortest beating period of the electron density is now 1.5 fs , which is still larger than the probe pulse duration of 1 fs .",

    "( [ photoelprob - wp ] ) ] , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fr_nofr](b ) , it is clear that the frozen - density approximation breaks down and provides a completely different result compared to that obtained with a correct treatment of the electron dynamics during the probe pulse .",
    "angle - resolved photoelectron spectra calculated with and without the frozen - density approximation ( not shown here ) have even a completely different structure .",
    "thus , the connection of the photoelectron probability to the electronic wave packet state at the time of the probe - pulse arrival is lost .",
    "this example demonstrates that if the probe - pulse duration is comparable with the shortest beating period of the electron density of a given system , the generated photoelectron spectra are not connected to its instantaneous electronic state .",
    "however , a probe - pulse duration being ten times shorter than the oscillation period of the electron density is enough to satisfy the frozen - density approximation , as we have verified using the example considered in sec .  [ section_slow_indole ] .",
    "we have described how time - dependent photoelectron spectroscopy can be employed for probing electron dynamics in molecules .",
    "we found that , quite counter - intuitively , electron dynamics can not be followed by means of time - dependent chemical shifts , since time - dependent photoelectron spectra consist of a series of photoelectron peaks centered on time - independent positions .",
    "the amplitude of the photoelectron peaks is indeed time - dependent , but the time variation of their angle - averaged amplitudes is quite small .",
    "therefore , angle - averaged photoelectron spectra hardly change in time .",
    "angle - resolved photoelectron spectra , however , do show a clear dependence on electron dynamics and their temporal changes are considerable .    looking into time - resolved photoelectron angular distributions at fixed photoelectron energies",
    "has several advantages .",
    "first , it facilitates their analysis , since a much smaller number of dyson orbitals has to be considered than in the case of energy - unresolved distributions .",
    "second , concentrating on photoelectron angular distributions at high photoelectron energies allows for a high spatial resolution . in the case of the indole molecule",
    ", it additionally simplified the study , since the orthogonalization correction to the plane - wave approximation was suppressed at high photoelectron energies .",
    "angle - resolved spectra do not follow the instantaneous electron density , instead , there are two contributions to the angle - resolved spectra .",
    "the first contribution is determined by the real part of electron density matrix elements , and correlates with the electron density and related quantities such as charge distributions at the time of the probe - pulse arrival .",
    "the second contribution is determined by the imaginary part of electron density matrix elements and correlates with the instantaneous electron current .",
    "we have shown how to distinguish the two contributions to the angle - resolved spectra using fourier analysis .",
    "the connection of the time - resolved photoelectron spectra to the time - dependent quantities described above holds only if the probe pulse duration is much shorter than the shortest beating period of the electron density .",
    "otherwise , this connection breaks down and electron dynamics during the probe pulse duration contribute a time - independent background to the spectra decreasing the signal contrast .",
    "finally , applying the configuration - interaction method for the calculation of the dicationic states of indole , we have demonstrated that electron correlations of the remaining ion after the ionization by the probe pulse are crucial for giving rise to a time dependence of the photoelectron spectra .",
