    "assuming that _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029 is just next to cl * 1806 - 20 ( at a distance of @xmath94 kpc from us ) , we obtain @xmath0ray luminosities of @xmath95 erg s@xmath11 and @xmath901 - 100 gev@xmath96 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath901 - 100 gev@xmath92 is marginally within the range for gev sources of snr@xmath8mc hadronic interaction , while the @xmath93 is beyond the range of 0.1 - 100 gev luminosities for snrs .",

    "the cross section area of proton - proton collisions is @xmath98 @xmath99 , and the angular diameter of the cloud is @xmath100 , which corresponds to @xmath920  pc at 8.7kpc .",
    "we also assume the @xmath0ray conversion efficiency for each individual proton - proton collision to reach the maximum of 0.1 .",
    "hence , we inferred the @xmath0ray conversion efficiency of cosmic - ray energy to be @xmath101 and the required power from a nearby cosmic - ray accelerator to be @xmath102 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "a typical supernova explosion releases energy of a canonical amount of @xmath103 erg , and its remnant can vigorously accelerate cosmic rays for @xmath104 kyr @xcite , with an efficiency of @xmath105 for converting kinetic energy to non - thermal cosmic - ray energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the energy budget @xmath102 erg s@xmath11 is so high that even a combined contribution from several snrs inside or around cl * 1806 - 20 , if they exist , _ can not _ supply it .",
    "even if sgr 1806 - 20 is a gev - emitting magnetar , it normally accelerates leptons but not hadrons , like other @xmath0ray pulsars ( cf .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to exclude sgr 1806 - 20 as a major hadronic source of _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029 .",
    "@xcite constrained the total kinetic energy of all stellar winds from cl * 1806 - 20 to be @xmath106 erg s@xmath11 , which is dominated by lbv 1806 - 20 and/or the four wr - stars .",
    "assuming that the entire cluster is the energy source of _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029 , we obtain an efficiency of cosmic - ray production of @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , there is _ no _ evidence for the combined stellar wind of all cl * 1806 - 20 members to be the major source .",
    "regardless of the cosmic - ray origin(s ) , the proton density ( @xmath9100 @xmath97 ) in mcs near cl * 1806 - 20 is far from being sufficient to cause the observed @xmath0ray emission .",
    "it follows that a purely hadronic scenario does _ not _ support the adjacence between _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029 and this cluster at all .",
    "the analyses of _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations determined the spin - frequency of sgr 1806 - 20 on 2011 mar 23 to be @xmath108 hz , and the average spin - down rate from 2005 july to 2011 march to be @xmath109 hz s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "hence , we obtain a spin - down power of @xmath110 erg s@xmath11 . adopting the same @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    ", we also obtain a surface magnetic field strength of @xmath113 g at the pole .",

    ", we have @xmath115 , which is consistent with the prediction for magnetars by @xcite .",
    "assuming that sgr 1806 - 20 is the energy source of _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029 , we obtain @xmath0ray conversion efficiencies of @xmath116 and @xmath117 . assuming that the entire cluster is the energy source of _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029",
    ", we obtain a @xmath0ray conversion efficiency of @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , the total kinetic energy of all stellar winds from cl * 1806 - 20 can easily account for the emission detected at _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029 , while the energy loss of sgr 1806 - 20 alone , which mostly arises from magnetic energy , can only contribute to a small component of the emission .",
    "whereas , synchrotron cooling generally makes leptonic cosmic - rays difficult to produce @xmath0ray photons of a few gev or above via synchrotron radiation .",
    "it follows that normal stellar winds from cl * 1806 - 20 _ can not _ explain the strong emission at energies above a few gev and the gev - tev pl connection .",
    "however , with the reduced synchrotron losses for high - energy ic - emitting electrons , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) can maintain their high gev - tev @xmath0ray fluxes for timescales exceeding the lifetime of their progenitor pulsars @xcite .",
    "most tev - detected pwne are associated with pulsars of high spin - down power @xmath119 erg s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "although the spin - down power of sgr 1806 - 20 is an order of magnitude lower than this threshold , the major mechanism of energy injection for a magnetar is the rapid decay of its strong magnetic field @xcite , which may account for the pwn - required power for sgr 1806 - 20 .    assuming that the loss of magnetic energy of sgr 1806 - 20 is the major source for the emission at energies @xmath68 gev , an integration adopting the bkpl parameters in table  [ spectral ] yields a @xmath0ray conversion efficiency of @xmath120 gev@xmath121 .",
    "therefore , sgr 1806 - 20 alone is sufficient to generate a pwn which may account for the flux at energies @xmath68 gev .",
    "furthermore , the gev - tev spectral connection is also consistent with this pwn scenario .",
    "noticeably , the photon index @xmath122 of hess j1808 - 204 @xcite is consistent with the photon index @xmath123 of hess j1713 - 381 @xcite , which is a tev pwn produced by the magnetar cxou j171405.7 - 381031 @xcite . similarly to sgr 1806 - 20 , cxou j171405.7 - 381031 has a spin - down power of @xmath124 erg s@xmath11 , a surface magnetic field strength of @xmath125 g at the pole @xcite and hence the power of magnetic field decay @xmath126 erg s@xmath127 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "a major uncertainty of this scenario is that there is no firmly identified pwn in this region , as the leptonic and/or hadronic nature of hess j1808 - 204 is currently unclear @xcite .    at around 2011 january 21 ,",
    "the lat flux of _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029 started an abrupt yet dramatic enhancement with a slight spectral steepening , which lasted for @xmath12845 days .",
    "it is _ unlikely _ to be associated with any x - ray outburst of sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "as the enhancement is constrained to occur at energies @xmath128400 mev , we interpret that the enhanced emission is mostly leptonic .",
    "furthermore , according to the 3rd catalog of agns detected by the _ fermi _ lat ( 3lac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is _ no _ discovered agn within @xmath129 from the center of _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029 .",
    "therefore , we speculate the possibility of an independent @xmath0ray outburst of sgr 1806 - 20 occuring at around that epoch .",
    "_ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029/hess j1808 - 204 has intense @xmath0ray emission , with the spectrum from 300 mev to 4 tev well described by a pl model of photon index @xmath130 . in terms of the energy budget , the emission from 200 mev to several gev",
    "is easily accounted for by snr g9.7 - 0.0 interacting hadronically with a mc and/or leptonic particles in stellar winds from cl * 1806 - 20 .",
    "we speculate the possibility that the emission from several gev to 4 tev is leptonic and dominated by a pwn powered by the magnetic - field decay of sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "such a ` hybrid ' scenario is also consistent with the morphologies we observed : the centroid at the @xmath34 of 200 mev is almost equidistant from the snr g9.7 - 0.0 center and sgr 1806 - 20/cl * 1806 - 20 ; in 3 - 500 gev , the entire feature is resolved to be two separated clumps ( with a @xmath131 significance ) , whose regions are _ respectively _ coincident with hess j1808 - 204 and snr g9.7 - 0.0 .",
    "we confirm that an abrupt yet dramatic enhancement of 60 - 400 mev ( probably leptonic ) lat flux of _ fermi _ j1808.2 - 2029 occurs from 2011 january 21 to 2011 mar 7 .",
    "whether it is caused by the magnetar sgr 1806 - 20 or not remains an open question .",
