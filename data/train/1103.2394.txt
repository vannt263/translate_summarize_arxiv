    "high energy heavy - ion collisions are used to study strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions . at sufficiently high collision energies",
    ", it is believed that hot and dense deconfined matter , commonly referred to as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is formed . with the advent of a new generation of experiments at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite a new energy domain is accessible to study the properties of such a state of matter .",
    "many observables have been proposed to probe deconfined matter formed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the production of heavy - quarks and quarkonium at lhc energies is promising since their production rate allows now careful studies of their characteristics ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions , polarization , flow , azimuthal correlations )  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the production of charm is expected to be large enough to make regeneration mechanisms possible .",
    "the regeneration of j/@xmath0  mesons due to the recombination of @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks in later stage of the heavy - ion collision would be a direct probe of the deconfined qcd matter  @xcite .",
    "one of the experimental methods to quantify the nuclear medium effects in the production of a given observable ( @xmath8 ) is the measurement of the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath9 ) in nucleus - nucleus ( a  a ) collisions , defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the average number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the invariant yield of the observable @xmath8 in a ",
    "a ( pp ) collisions at a given ( same ) center - of - mass energy . in the absence of nuclear matter effects",
    ", the nuclear modification factor should be equal to unity for experimental observables commonly called _ hard probes _ ( large @xmath4 particles , jets , heavy - flavour , etc ) .",
    "a similar factor @xmath14 , measured in p  a collisions , is crucial in order to disentangle hot and cold nuclear matter effects in a  a collisions .",
    "first results on quarkonium production in proton - proton collisions at @xmath15  tev have been published by the lhc experiments  @xcite and a successful heavy - ion campaigns took place at the lhc in november 2010 and 2011 , when pb  pb collisions at the energy per nucleon pair of @xmath16  tev where delivered to the lhc experiments , for an integrated luminosity of about 9  @xmath17b@xmath18 .",
    "the nominal lhc energies for pp  and pb  pb collisions are @xmath19  tev and @xmath20  tev , respectively .    in this letter , we present an interpolation of the @xmath4-integrated and differential inclusive j/@xmath0  cross section in pp  collisions to @xmath1  tev and @xmath2  tev .",
    "we establish a procedure to determine the j/@xmath0  cross section at arbitrary energy values , which makes possible the calculation of the j/@xmath0  nuclear modification factors for any colliding system and energy at the lhc .",
    "the interpolation is done in three steps .",
    "the first step is an energy interpolation of the existing @xmath4-integrated j/@xmath0  production cross section measurements at mid - rapidity ( sec .",

    "the second step is the evaluation of the energy evolution of the rapidity distribution ( sec .",
