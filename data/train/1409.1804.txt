    "the deep - inelastic precision data from hera allow determinations of @xmath2 at the 1% level @xcite , and precise measurements of the mass of the charm quark @xcite and parton distribution functions .",
    "this applies to an even further extent to the proposed deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments to be carried out in the future at new facilities , such as the eic @xcite and the lhec @xcite , reaching much higher luminosities or energies than those available at hera @xcite .",
    "the corresponding analyses demand the knowledge of the anomalous dimensions and wilson coefficients at 3-loop order for the structure function @xmath1 , including the heavy flavor corrections . for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass of the heavy quark ,",
    "the massive wilson coefficients are known to factorize into the massless ones and massive operator matrix elements , allowing the computation of @xmath1 to the 1% level @xcite .",
    "the 3-loop light flavor wilson coefficients are known @xcite .",
    "thus , it remains to calculate all the contributing massive omes .    in these proceedings",
    "we discuss the progress we have made in recent times in the calculation of these quantities @xcite , with special emphasis on the non - singlet @xcite and pure singlet contributions @xcite . by now , six out of eight operator matrix elements have been computed by us , namely , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . only the operator matrix elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 remain to be calculated , although in these cases , we also have partial results for some of the color factors @xcite . in the region",
    "@xmath3 also all wilson coefficients for the structure function @xmath13 were calculated @xcite . using these operator matrix elements , we have computed the massive wilson coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 at nnlo . once @xmath12 is available , we will be able to obtain also @xmath18 .    with the calculation of these operator matrix elements ,",
    "we also obtain as a by - product the terms proportional to @xmath19 of the 3-loop anomalous dimensions . in the case of transversity",
    ", we performed the first calculation ab initio .",
    "our results agree with those given in the literature .",
    "the operator matrix elements also yield the heavy - to - light transition relations in the variable flavor number scheme to 3-loop order .",
    "these relations define the parton distributions for @xmath20 flavors from those of @xmath21 light flavors by the omes .",
    "in particular , we now have the relation corresponding to @xmath22 in the flavor non - singlet case .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the different methods we used for the calculation of the operator matrix elements and the required feynman integrals . in section",
    "[ results ] , we discuss our results and show the non - singlet and pure singlet contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we give some conclusions .",
    "the operator matrix elements are computed in terms of feynman diagrams using the standard feynman rules of qcd , together with those for local operator insertions @xcite .",
    "we generated the diagrams using qgraf @xcite , the output of which was processed using a form @xcite program @xcite , which ultimately allowed us to express the diagrams as a linear combination of scalar integrals .",
    "the number of scalar integrals required for the calculation of the omes is quite large .",
    "we used integration by parts identities in order to express all integrals in terms of a relatively small set of master integrals . for this purpose",
    "we used the c++ program reduze2 @xcite , which implements laporta s algorithm @xcite . since this algorithm requires the integrals to be identified by definite indices , we rewrite the operator insertions by introducing an auxiliary variable @xmath23 , multiplying the integrals by @xmath24 and summing in @xmath25 .",
    "for example , a line insertion is rewritten as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the momentum going through the line , and @xmath28 is a light - like vector . in this way , the operator insertion is turned into an artificial propagator , making the application of laporta s algorithm possible .",
    "similarly , the 3-point and 4-point vertex insertions can be re - expressed in terms of products of such artificial propagators .",
    "the master integrals were calculated using a variety of methods , namely ,    * hypergeometric functions @xcite * mellin - barnes integral representations @xcite . *",
    "hyperlogarithms for convergent integrals , @xcite * differential equations @xcite .",
    "the representations lead to multiple nested sums which are summed using algorithms based on difference fields @xcite , implemented in the packages sigma @xcite , harmonicsums @xcite , evaluatemultisums and sumproduction @xcite .",
    "the choice of method depends on the complexity of the integral under consideration .",
    "the simplest integrals are calculated using hypergeometric functions , while the most complicated integrals we have encountered so far have been computed in a systematic manner using the differential equation method .",
    "this method ultimately leads to difference equations that are then solved using the packages sigma and oresys @xcite .",
    "all omes calculated so far have been found to be expressible in terms of ( generalized ) nested harmonic sums . in particular , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can all be expressed solely in terms of standard harmonic sums defined by @xcite @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 . in the case of @xmath32 , we find for the first time in dis generalized harmonic sums in the final result .",
    "they are defined by @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath30 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "we have also found the emergence of inverse binomial sums @xcite , such as @xmath36 or @xmath37 this type of sums appears , e.g. , in the terms proportional to @xmath38 in @xmath39 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the mellin inversion of these quantities leads to harmonic polylogarithms in the case of eq .",
    "( [ hsums ] ) . in the case of eq .",
    "( [ ghsums ] ) , they also lead to generalized harmonic polylogarithms @xcite that we were able to re - express in terms of standard harmonic polylogarithms in a new variable @xmath40 . on the other hand",
    ", the mellin inversion of inverse binomial sums leads to iterated integrals over square root - valued alphabets .     to the structure function @xmath1 at 2- and 3-loop order using the abm nnlo parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite in the on - shell scheme for @xmath41 gev ; from @xcite.,width=264 ]     at 3-loop order for four flavors in the variable flavor number scheme matched at the scale @xmath42",
    "using the on - mass - shell definition of the charm quark mass @xmath43 and using the pdfs @xcite .",
    "the contributions due to the non - singlet , singlet and gluon distributions are shown individually ; from @xcite.,width=264 ]    the heavy flavor contributions to the structure function @xmath1 are obtained by a mellin convolution of the heavy flavor wilson coefficients with the respective parton distributions .",

    "we can see that they are smaller than @xmath47 in the kinematic region of hera .",
    "they will , however , become relevant at high luminosity machines such as the eic , where all 3-loop wilson coefficients will be of importance . as we mentioned in the introduction , the calculation of massive omes performed",
    "so far also allow us to obtain the transition relation for @xmath48 massless flavors of the flavor non - singlet distribution in the vnfs . in figure",
    "[ fig : vfns1 ] , we show the different contributions to the 4-flavor distribution @xmath49 as a function of @xmath23 for @xmath42 .",
    "we can see that the non - singlet contributions are very small , while the singlet and gluon contributions are much larger for small values of @xmath23 .",
    "the distributions for down and strange quarks are therefore nearly the same .     to the structure function @xmath1 as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath0 choosing @xmath50 ( on - shell scheme ) using the pdfs @xcite ; from @xcite.,width=226 ]    in figure [ fig:1 ]",
    ", we show the behavior of the constant part of the unrenormalized pure singlet ome , @xmath51 . the leading small @xmath23 term",
    "@xmath52 does nowhere describe this quantity . in the small @xmath23 region one",
    "has to add several subleading terms to get a sufficient approximation . in figure",
    "[ fig : f2c ] , the charm quark contribution to @xmath1 by the wilson coefficient @xmath53 is shown at @xmath54 and up to @xmath55 in dependence on @xmath23 and several values of @xmath0 , setting the factorization scale @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath55 correction is quite significant in the region of low @xmath23 , and at lower scales @xmath0 the @xmath54 corrections are larger than those at nnlo .",
    "we have made considerable progress in recent years in the calculation of heavy flavor corrections to dis at nnlo in in the region of large virtualities .",
