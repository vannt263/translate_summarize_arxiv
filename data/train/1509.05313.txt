    "the study of physical phenomena that arise in strongly correlated systems far from equilibrium has become a field of highly active research recently . @xcite for the theoretical description of such systems , greens - function - based approaches starting from the keldysh formalism @xcite have proven to be very useful . a number of different approximation schemes rely on this concept .",
    "@xcite central to these approaches is the self - energy which is related to the one - particle green s function through dyson s equation .",
    "however , while the numerical solution of dyson s equation is rather straightforward in the equilibrium case , the computational effort is considerably increased for systems out of equilibrium since operations with matrices depending on two independent contour time variables typically scale cubically in the number of time steps .",
    "apart from other challenges characteristic for the respective approach , already this scaling poses a severe limit on the maximal reachable propagation time in a numerical calculation .",
    "applying additional concepts or approximations , such as the generalized kadanoff - baym ansatz@xcite or exploiting a rapid decay of the memory,@xcite are necessary to overcome this limitation .",
    "it was proposed recently@xcite that it can be advantageous to avoid the direct inversion of dyson s equation by applying a mapping onto a markovian propagation scheme . to this end it is necessary to _ assume _ the existence of a certain functional form for the nonequilibrium self - energy , namely the existence of a lehmann representation .    in the present paper",
    "we explicitly construct this lehmann representation . with this at hand",
    ", we pick up the proposed idea to solve dyson s equation by means of a markovian propagation and exploit the fact that the lehmann representation of the exact self - energy of a small reference system has a finite number of terms only .",
    "this allows us to solve dyson s equation with an effort that scales linearly in the maximum propagation time @xmath1 .    for equilibrium green s functions ,",
    "the lehmann representation is a well established concept.@xcite it uncovers the analytical properties of the green s function and can be used to show that the related spectral function is positive definite .",
    "it is further essential for the evaluation of diagrams through contour integrations in the complex frequency plane , for the derivation of sum rules , etc .",
    "the generalization of the lehmann representation to nonequilibrium green s function is straightforward.@xcite applications include nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) where it allows for a hamiltonian - based formulation of the impurity problem.@xcite    the explicit construction of a lehmann representation for the _ self - energy _",
    ", on the other hand , turns out to be more tedious , already for the equilibrium case : in a recent work such a construction was worked out @xcite from a diagrammatic perspective and used to cure the problem of possibly negative spectral functions arising from a summation of a subclass of diagrams .    here",
    ", we address the nonequilibrium self - energy of a general , interacting lattice - fermion model : ( i ) we rigorously show the existence of the lehmann representation by presenting an explicit construction scheme that is based on the lehmann representation of the nonequilibrium green s function .",
    "( ii ) using a simple example , namely the cluster - perturbation theory @xcite ( cpt ) , we furthermore demonstrate that the lehmann representation of the self - energy can in fact be implemented numerically and used to study the time evolution of a locally perturbed hubbard model on a large square lattice ( @xmath0 sites ) .",
    "propagation times of several orders of magnitude in units of the inverse hopping amplitude can be reached with modest computational resources .",
    "( iii ) while the cpt approximation for the self - energy is rather crude and shown to violate a number of conservation laws , it is possible with this approximation to study the weak - coupling limit of the hubbard model in a reasonable way . in particular",

    "[ fig : uquench ] we show the long - time evolution for quenches to different @xmath173 . for weak @xmath220",
    "we find a ( prethermalization - like ) separation into two different time scales .",
    "initially the time evolution qualitatively follows the non - interacting case , i.e. , we see a fast decay of the local moment at the impurity site ( blue line ) followed by a quasi - stationary region of collapse - and - revival oscillations . for larger times these oscillations decay and",
    "the system relaxes into a state characterized by quasi - periodic fluctuations around its long - time average ( dashed blue line ) which are driven by different frequencies . taking a look at the @xmath173 dependence of the dynamics we notice that the region of collapse - and - revival oscillations shrinks with increasing @xmath173 and finally vanishes for @xmath221 .",
    "the system then directly relaxes into a state with fluctuations around its long - time average .    for comparison , also the magnetic moment at the neighbouring sites @xmath190 is plotted . while its dynamics for short times must naturally be different from @xmath195 due to the inhomogeneous initial state , we would expect a qualitative agreement in the long - time limit if the system thermalizes .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "there remains a clear difference in the amplitude of the fluctuations around the long - time average up to the largest simulated times .",
    "hence we conclude that the system still keeps memory of the initial state and thus does not thermalize",
    ".    having in mind the general discussion on prethermalization in sec.[sec : numerics_intro ] , one can give an intuitive interpretation of these observations based on the effective - medium approach : while the non - interacting system is isolated and its dynamics is constrained through many constants of motion , there is a large number of virtual orbitals coupled to the system in the interacting case .",
    "these virtual orbitals act like a surrounding bath . for weak @xmath173 the virtual orbitals",
    "are only weakly coupled to the system and their influence is delayed to large times , while initially the dynamics is constrained similar to the non - interacting case . for strong @xmath173 , on the other hand , the coupling is strong and affects the dynamics of the system considerably .",
    "however , the number of virtual sites is still too small to allow for a complete dissipation of the information on the initial state into the bath . therefore , a thermalized state is not reached . for an exact calculation",
    "the number of virtual sites would scale exponentially in system size .",
    "for cpt , on the other hand , it scales exponentially only in cluster size but linearly in the number of clusters and thus in the system size .",
    "memory of the initial state is therefore retained within the one - particle density matrix and leaves its traces in the magnetic moments as seen in our calculations .",
    "cpt as an approximation lacks any kind of self - consistency and is thus unable to respect the fundamental continuity equations and their corresponding conservation laws .",
    "@xcite therefore , one has to expect a violation of energy- or particle - number conservation , for example .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the equilibrium case where cpt interpolates between the exact limits @xmath50 and @xmath222 , it yields exact results only for quenches to @xmath223 .",
    "the dynamics after a quench to the atomic limit @xmath224 ( with finite @xmath176 ) can not be described exactly due to the non - local entanglement of the initial state .",
    "we thus generally expect that the quality of the cpt results degrades with increasing interaction strength .",
    "the numerical results for the total energy , see fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] , confirm this expectation .",
    "energy conservation is respected for @xmath223 , where cpt is exact . with @xmath225 and increasing , however , a significant time dependence of the total energy sets in earlier and earlier . for @xmath226 energy conservation is violated already for @xmath227 .",
    "similar results are found for the total magnetization @xmath228 , cf .",
    "[ fig : total_density ] . while the magnetization should be constant for all times since neither hopping nor interaction ( cf .",

    "oscillations arise and the conservation of total magnetization is violated . for increasing @xmath173 the oscillations set in earlier indicating again that the quality of cpt is best for values of @xmath173 close to zero .",
    "we note that the total particle number @xmath229 , however , is conserved during the time evolution .",
    "this holds true for a half - filled and homogeneously charged system and is due to the fact that cpt preserves particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this can easily be understood as follows : each cluster hamiltonian is particle - hole symmetric and since each cluster is solved exactly within cpt the corresponding effective hamiltonian @xmath182 is also particle - hole symmetric .",
    "the cpt hamiltonian is now given by eq . which additionally includes the inter - cluster hopping",

    "concluding , we have shown that the nonequilibrium self - energy of an interacting lattice - fermion model can uniquely be decomposed into a superposition of noninteracting , isolated modes .",
    "this decomposition is a direct analog to a well - established decomposition of equilibrium green s functions , called the _",
    "lehmann representation_. our proof not only provides a direct scheme to construct the lehmann representation of the self - energy , and thus allows for a deeper theoretical understanding of the self - energy complementary to its diagrammatic definition , but also proves useful for practical applications .    as a proof of concept we investigated the time evolution of local magnetic moments in the fermionic hubbard model after an interaction quench using nonequilibrium cluster - perturbation theory .",

    "however , memory of the initial state persists in the density matrix up to the largest simulated times clearly indicating the absence of thermalization .",
    "while the simple treatment of correlations by nonequilibrium cpt has shown to be enough to cover the mentioned two - stage relaxation dynamics , it also leads to a violation of the fundamental conservation laws of energy and total magnetization .",
