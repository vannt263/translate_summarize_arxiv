    "vavilov - cherenkov radiation ( vcr ) is a well established phenomenon widely used in physics and technology  @xcite . nevertheless , some of its fundamental aspects are still open .",
    "recently , interest in the problem of surpassing the cherenkov threshold has been renewed .",
    "a group of researchers from comenius univercity , bratislava , cern and jinr have carried out measurements of vcr induced by a high - energy beam of lead ions in air , helium and various crystals ( na49 experiment )  @xcite .",
    "the members of this group supposed  @xcite , using the previously obtained experimental data on vcr induced by relativistic electrons in air  @xcite , that the pre - cherenkov electromagnetic shock wave could arise when the charge particle velocity @xmath0 coincides with the phase velocity of light in the medium @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the refractive index of the medium , and @xmath3 denotes light velocity in the vacuum ) . for a relativistic electron moving in a gas the radiation intensity was measured as a function of a gas pressure @xmath4 , which is related in a simple way to the gas refractive index @xmath2 .",
    "changing continuously the refractive index of the medium one gets a tool to analyse vcr both below and above the cherenkov threshold .",
    "a small but finite value of intensity indicates the existence of vcr below the threshold velocity @xmath5  @xcite . in spite of the fact that these experiments are preliminary , it is useful to conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of vcr both below and above the cherenkov threshold",
    ". it is the goal of this paper .",
    "we investigate electromagnetic fields ( emf ) radiated by a point charge uniformly moving in a dielectric dispersive medium .",
    "it is suggested that uniform motion of a particle is maintained by some external force whose origin is not of interest for us . in the case of frequency",
    "independent electric permittivity @xmath6 , there is no electromagnetic field ( emf ) before the cherenkov cone accompanying the charge , an infinite emf on the cherenkov cone itself and finite values of emf strengths behind it  @xcite .",
    "so information concerning the transition effects arising when charge velocity coincides with @xmath7 is lost ( except for the existence of the cherenkov shock wave itself )  @xcite .    in the classical electrodynamics",
    "@xcite vcr is a collective phenomenon involving a large number of atoms of the medium whose electrons are excited by emf of the passing particle .",
    "therefore , we use the macroscopic complex dielectric function @xmath8  @xcite @xmath9 this is the standard parameterization describing many optical phenomena  @xcite and is well suited for air - like media investigated in  @xcite . following  @xcite",
    ", we extrapolate the parameterization ( [ eps ] ) to all @xmath10 .",
    "this means that we disregard the excitation of nuclear levels and the discrete structure of scatterers .",
    "the charge and current densities of the treated problem , fig .",
    "[ fig : problem ] , are given by @xmath11 the cylindrical components of emf strengths can be written in the following form  @xcite @xmath12 @xmath13 we present here only a minimal set of mathematical relations to evaluate emf .",
    "for mathematical details ( derivation of equations , analysis of possible divergences , semiclassical wkb estimates , gauge and polarization selections , kronig - kramers dispersion relations etc . )",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of emf strengths at the surface of the cylinder c@xmath14 ( @xmath15,\\;z=0 $ ] ) , induced by a fast particle moving along the `` z '' axis is exhibited in figs .",
    "[ fig : ez ] and [ fig : hfi ] . to describe the passing of a light barrier by a charge particle in the experiments  @xcite",
    ", we select the following parameters .",
    "the pressure is related to the gas density @xmath16 by the well - known thermodynamic relation : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the gas volume , @xmath19 is its temperature and @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant . in the definition of @xmath8 ( [ eps ] )",
    "@xmath21 is the plasma frequency @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the number of electrons per unit of volume , @xmath24 is the electron mass , @xmath25 is some resonance frequency and @xmath26 is the atomic number of the gas particles .",
    "the particle velocity is @xmath27 .",
    "the cherenkov threshold can be associated with the critical velocity @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "changing @xmath29 from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , describes a transition from the superlight regime to the sublight one , and corresponds to an approximately 100 time decrease in the gas pressure .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : ez ] and [ fig : hfi ] one can see formation of the well - defined front of electromagnetic shock waves for @xmath32 and suppression of a pre - front wave structure which existed for @xmath33 .",
    "a fine structure of emf strengths presented in figs .  [ fig : ez ] and [ fig : hfi ] indicates that the response of a dispersive medium to a penetrating charge particle manifests itself in an axially symmetrical wake - like  @xcite space - time distribution .",
    "these are well - known properties , in the case of @xmath32 , of any homogeneous isotropic electron plasma with a dielectric function @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "we will use the terminology of `` wake '' , although the cherenkov cone does not exist for subthreshold velocities @xmath33 .",
    "the energy flux per unit length radiated through the surface of a cylinder c@xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : problem ] ) coaxial with the @xmath35 axis for the total time of motion is given by poynting s vector @xmath36 @xmath37 time dependence of emf flux densities @xmath38 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sro ] .",
    "one can see very different time distributions for subthreshold and normal regimes .",
    "the emf flux is localized more strongly than the emf strengths .",
    "it is a result of complicated interference of electric and magnetic strengths entering via eq  ( [ w ] ) in the definition of poynting s vector .",
    "using @xmath39 and @xmath40 given by ( [ cfields ] ) for the whole time of charge motion one gets @xmath41 where the @xmath42 component of a spectral density is given by @xcite @xmath43 at a large distance in the limit @xmath44 this expression turns into the well - known relations  @xcite @xmath45 the validity of eq .",
    "( [ w0 ] ) has been confirmed in  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fb ] , we present the radiated energy losses per unit length @xmath46 on a cylinder c@xmath14 as a function of a particle velocity for a few parameters of @xmath29 .",
    "one can see that for the fixed permittivity of the medium there exist radiated energy losses for the subthreshold velocities .",
    "the increasing damping reduces domains of a particle velocity with an essential vcr .",
    "the spectral distributions @xmath47 of the radiated energy losses are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fw ] .",
    "the numbers of particular curves mean @xmath48 .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath32 all @xmath10 from the interval @xmath49 contribute to the energy losses . for @xmath33 the interval of permissible @xmath10 diminishes .",
    "the spectral density @xmath47 of the radiated energy losses defines the corresponding photon number spectral density @xmath50 and the total number of photons emitted per unit length @xmath51 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fw ] , one can see that the damping parameter reduces the high frequency part @xmath52 of the domains where vcr is emitted .",
    "[ fig : fb ] shows that the damping strongly reduces the radiated energy losses especially for the low velocities .",
    "spectral domains of vcr can approximately be fixed by the condition @xmath53 .",
    "these domains are defined by the two phenomenological parameters of the medium , namely , the effective frequency @xmath25 of oscillators and the damping @xmath54 describing interactions with the other degrees of freedom .",
    "the evaluated photon number spectral density @xmath55 and the total number of photons emitted per unit length @xmath56 look very much like the corresponded spectral distributions @xmath47 and the radiated energy losses @xmath46 , respectively . to not overload the composition",
    ", we do nt present the figures for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it follows from fig .",
    "[ fig : sro ] that rapid oscillations of the radiation intensity as a function of time should be observed in a particular detector . to detect @xmath57",
    ", one should have a detector imbedded into a thin collimator and directed towards the charge motion axis .",
    "the collimator should be impenetrable for the @xmath58 quanta with directions different from the radial one .",
    "the semiclassical wkb estimation  @xcite for a period @xmath59 or the counting of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : sro ] gives @xmath60 .",
    "it seems that these oscillations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sro ] for air - like media could be very difficult to resolve experimentally .",
    "we have evaluated electromagnetic potentials , strengths and poynting s vector describing space - time distribution of emf induced in the air - like medium by a fast charge particle both below and above the cherenkov threshold .    in the case of @xmath32",
    "the response of a dispersive medium to a penetrating charge particle manifests itself in the formation of a sharp front and rapid wake - like oscillations behind the moving charge indicating the appearance of electromagnetic shock waves . a fine structure of emf for @xmath33 manifests in the existence of emf radiation under the cherenkov threshold in the domain of anomalous dispersion .",
    "we have calculated the spectral distributions , the number of the emitted photons and the radiated emf energy flux .",
    "it is shown that the transition to the subthreshold regime ( @xmath61 ) and the damping ( @xmath62 ) lead to the sharp reduction of the anomalous frequency range where vcr is emitted .",
