    "since the first surveys of the @xmath0-ray sky with the cos  b satellite the nature of most @xmath0-ray sources remain a mystery , as few of these sources have firmly established counterparts at any other waveband ( swanenburg et al .",

    "wilson ( 1980 ) argued convincingly that the x - ray luminosity of ctb 87 , which is 100 times less than that of the crab , implies that the spin - down power of the embedded pulsar must be correspondingly less , @xmath85  ergs  s@xmath4 . even assuming that 100% of this power is emitted in the egret energy band , the resulting flux of @xmath86 ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath4 is 20 times less that the egret measured average flux of 3eg  j2016 + 3657 .",
    "this argument is insensitive to distance as long as the x - ray synchrotron nebula is considered a calorimeter of the present pulsar power . if , instead , ctb 87 hosts a geminga - like pulsar whose energy is no longer trapped by the nebula , and is maximally efficient in the production of @xmath0-rays , then we would expect a spin - down power of only @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "such a pulsar is inadequate to explain the flux of 3eg  j2016 + 3657 unless it were at @xmath88  pc , which is certainly ruled out by the h  i and x - ray measured column density to the snr .",
    "we believe that the snr ctb 87 is an interesting crab - like remnant , but is too weak and too far away to be a good candidate for the egret source 3eg j2016 + 3657 .",
    "we believe that the most likely candidate for 3eg j2016 + 3657 is the radio source b2013 + 370 , described in  4 . based on its radio properties b2013 + 370 is very likely to be a blazar , similar to the others seen by egret .",
    "mattox et al . ( 1997 ) find that only the brightest radio - flat agn can be identified with egret sources with any level of confidence , and demonstrate that there is a high degree of correlation between @xmath0-ray and radio fluxes of egret blazars .",
    "egret has detected more than 65 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , almost all of which can be classified as blazars .",
    "the blazars seen by egret all share the common characteristic that they are radio - loud , flat spectrum sources , with radio spectral indices @xmath89 ( von montigny et al . 1995 ) . several of these blazars exhibit superluminal motion of components resolved with vlbi ( e. g. , 3c 279 , 3c 273 , pks 0528 + 134 ) .",
    "the blazar class of agn includes highly polarized quasars , bl lac objects , or optically violent variable ( ovv ) quasars .",
    "the sources are characterized by one or more properties of this source class , namely , a flat radio spectrum , a continuum spectrum that is non - thermal , optical polarization and strong variability . for most egret blazars",
    ", the @xmath0-ray luminosity dominates that other wavebands .",
    "the probability that the blazar b2013 + 370 is the correct identification for the egret source 3eg j2016 + 3657 can be estimated by following the calculations presented by mattox et al .",
    "the a priori probability that egret will detect a random flat - spectrum blazar with a 5 ghz flux of 2 jy is 5.8% ( mattox et al .",
    "however , since in this case there is an egret source at this location , the conditional ( a posteriori ) probability must be used , which takes into account the fact that a gamma - ray source has already been detected .",
    "the a posteriori probability that a blazar of the type that we see in the error circle of an egret source is in fact the correct identification is about 98.8% .",
    "the factors that enter into this calculation are the radio flux ( 2 jy ) and spectral index ( + 0.3 ) , the 95% error radius of the egret source ( 0.55@xmath90 ) , the distance of the radio source from the center of the egret circle ( 0.27@xmath90 ) , and the mean distance between radio sources which are at least as strong and at least as flat as this one ( @xmath91 . )    fig .",
    "8 shows the spectral energy distribution of b2013 + 370 , assuming that it is the egret source 3eg j2016 + 3657 .",
    "the figure shows the relative amounts of energy detected in equal logarithmic frequency ranges .",
    "the radio fluxes were obtained from the nrao / vla sky survey , the westerbork northern sky survey ( see  4.2 ) , and from a compilation of radio fluxes in weiler and shaver ( 1978 ) .",
    "the fluxes at mm wavelengths were obtained from reynolds et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , taken with the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "the optical point was measured by us at the mdm observatory and has been corrected for extinction (  4.1 ) . the estimated unabsorbed x - ray flux for source 3 ( = b2013 + 370 ) in the asca band of 1  10 kev is @xmath92 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , and in the rosat band of 0.1  2.4 kev is @xmath93 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 . for the flux estimations we have assumed @xmath94 @xmath3 , and a power - law photon index of 2 . the data in fig",
    "8 are not contemporaneous .",
    "the egret spectrum was derived as explained in  2 .    the broad band spectrum shown in fig .",
    "8 is that of a typical egret blazar , dominated by the power output in @xmath0-rays .",
    "the spectrum shows the characteristic features of a blazar , with a synchrotron peak at lower energies , and an inverse compton peak at higher energies .",
    "the high @xmath0-ray luminosity of a blazar suggests that the emission is likely to be beamed , and therefore doppler - boosted , along the line of sight . in this scenario , synchrotron radiation from high - energy electrons in a relativistically outflowing jet",
    "are responsible for the radio to uv continuum .",
    "the high - energy photons come from inverse compton scattering of low - energy photons by the same relativistic electrons in the jet . details of this model remain unresolved ( e.g. see hartman et al .",
    "1997 , for a review ) .",
    "the relative power output in @xmath0-rays for b2013 + 370 is less than that of a typical flat - spectrum radio quasar seen by egret , and is more similar to that observed in bl lac objects .",
    "the location of the broad synchrotron peak in the optical - ir band rather than in the x - ray band is an indication that b2013 + 370 could be a low - energy peaked bl lac object ( lbl ) , according to the classification suggested by giommi & padovani ( 1994 ) .      in conclusion , we have made a comprehensive study of the x - ray and @xmath0-ray sources in the error circle of the cos  b source 2cg 075 + 00 .",
    "we have identified most of the x - ray sources in the error boxes of the egret sources .",
    "one reasonable hypothesis is that 2cg 075 + 00 is largely the same source as 3eg j2021 + 3716 and that 3eg j2016 + 3657 is a new source which can be identified with the radio blazar 2013 + 3710 = x - ray source 3 .",
    "herein 2cg 075 + 00 = 3eg j2021 + 3716 remains unidentified .",
    "clearly , for the 3eg sources considered here , we need more refined @xmath0-ray positions and extensive monitoring ( possibly by agile and glast ) to establish their ultimate nature .    we thank jonathan kemp for obtaining optical images at mdm observatory .",
    "we acknowledge support by nasa grant nag5 - 3696 ( r. m. ) , nasa grant nag57935 ( e. v. g. ) , and nasa grant nag5 - 3229 ( j. p. h ) . this research has made use of data obtained from heasarc at goddard space flight center and the simbad astronomical database .",
