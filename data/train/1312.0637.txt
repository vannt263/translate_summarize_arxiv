    "it has long been known that the diversity in spectra of galaxies is driven by the variance in their underlying physical properties , such as stellar age and metallicity .",
    "the line indices , or the relatively narrow regions of a spectrum , are isolated for the parameter sensitivities .",
    "@xcite found that metallicity - sensitive indices from a 10-filter photometric system correlate with the luminosity of ellipticals , giving incredible insights to the role of gravitational potential well to the chemical evolution in those galaxies .",
    "the concept of `` informative '' wavelength regions had since been extended to spectroscopy .",
    "perhaps the most well - known example is the 4000    break  @xcite and its correlation with the stellar age and metallicity in early - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite later assembled 21  absorption indices and measured them for several hundred stars in the galaxy , and the same set were measured by @xcite for several hundred globular clusters and galaxies .",
    "they are called the lick / ids   indices @xcite . these indices are continuum subtracted , where the continua are defined on the left and right flanks in the vicinity of the actual index wavelength range . within an index wavelength range , one or more absorption lines , or a feature , are present .",
    "therefore , the index strength can be a sensitive measure for specific galaxy parameters . the @xmath0@xcite '' , with the subscript @xmath5 presumably signifying the left and right regions of influence being narrower than the previous definition by @xcite .",
    "the name appeared in @xcite is `` d(4000 ) '' . ] and @xmath2  @xcite indices were subsequently defined , and were used to constrain stellar age and the starburst mass fraction in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the concept of informative wavelength regions has also been used in conjunction with a popular data compression technique , the principal component analysis ( pca ) , to derive physical parameters of galaxies . each spectrum in a galaxy sample is represented by the weighted sum of the same orthogonal basis , hereafter the eigenspectra @xcite , and the weights are called the eigencoefficients .",
    "the lowest orders of the eigenspectra encapsulate most of the sample variance in nearby galaxies @xcite , forming a _ subspace _ which lies in a higher - dimensional wavelength space . using pca , @xcite",
    "have measured , for a galaxy sample from the sdss @xcite , the eigencoefficients within the restframe 37504150    out of the full optical wavelength range available , 38009200     in the observed frame .",
    "the eigencoefficients were used to correlate with physical properties of the galaxies .",
    "later , @xcite have estimated model - based stellar populations and dust parameters for a sample of sdss galaxies .",
    "they used eigencoefficients calculated in the 37005500    range , in conjunction with the bayesian parameter estimation method .    despite decades of effort and progress , the lick / ids  indices remain to be subjective",
    "the root cause lies in the difficulties in defining the true continua in the vicinity of a feature .",
    "two main hurdles are : ( 1 ) there is no `` true '' continuum in late - type stars at the lick / ids   spectral resolution and the continua are `` pseudo '' @xcite . ( 2 )",
    "the location and the width of the pseudocontinua are subjective .",
    "the location are chosen to flank the feature , and the width to be large enough in order to minimize the effect of typical stellar velocity dispersion of galaxies on the measured index strengths @xcite . for a galaxy of a given velocity dispersion",
    ", these characteristics determine the absorption lines present within the pseudocontinua , in turn impact the parameter sensitivity of the corresponding feature .",
    "for example , @xcite found in a single - burst stellar populations model that the narrow balmer index , h@xmath4@xmath6 , is significantly more sensitive to stellar age than its broad counterpart , @xmath7 , suggesting that the broader balmer indices may be contaminated by metal lines .",
    "they are the fe  i lines @xcite , present in the pseudocontinua of the broad , higher - order balmer indices @xcite .",
    "the pca  approach @xcite abandoned the use of pseudocontinua and bypassed difficulties ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) , but the feature wavelength ranges were chosen subjectively to include the 4000    break , unlike the lick / ids  index system in which they were measured . like the case in pseudocontinua ,",
    "the identity and the width of a feature can impact its parameter sensitivity , because they determine what absorption lines are present within .",
    "the reason for using pca   is that the eigenspectra are orthogonal , so that each eigenspectrum is potentially sensitive to individual physical parameters . clearly , the next - generation approach is to combine the orthogonal - decomposition strength of pca   with objectivity in defining the feature wavelength regions .",
    "the main goals of this paper are to identify the informative wavelength regions in an objective manner , and to associate physical significance with them .",
    "the analyses are performed on a solar - abundance model of simple stellar populations that is defined by two parameters , stellar age and metallicity .",
    "we use the cur matrix decomposition   @xcite , a powerful machine learning technique which has the ability to select statistically informative columns from a data matrix .",
    "the key characteristics of our approach are : ( a ) the continua are not explicitly used in the region  identification , bypassing the above - mentioned ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) which plague the lick / ids  indices .",
    "( b ) different from the previous pca   approach @xcite , in this work the regions are determined objectively , in terms of both the identity and the width .",
    "we cast an eye towards estimating physical parameters of real galaxies .",
    "this work results in two related applications .",
    "first , the identified regions and the parameter - eigencoefficient  relation can be used to determine the stellar age and metallicity of those early - type galaxies which have solar abundance ratios , no dust , and a single - burst star formation history .",
    "second , our region  identification method can be applied to any set of model spectra .",
    "users can generate their own parameter - eigencoefficient   relation from the model , and use that to estimate parameters of galaxies from the observed spectra .",
    "therefore , the intricate processes @xcite involved in conforming to a common index system , which attempt to account for the difference in spectral resolution between the observed spectra and the system , can be eliminated .    in  [ section : data ] , we present the model spectra . in ",
    "[ section : analysis ] , we present the cur matrix decomposition  and describe how it is used to identify informative wavelength regions in the model spectra . in  [ section : results ]",
    ", we present the identified regions , the comparison to the existing line indices , and their physical significance . in ",
    "[ section : summary ] , we conclude our work and discuss next steps .",
    "vacuum wavelengths are used throughout the paper .",
    "we wish to derive a set of informative regions applicable for estimating the stellar age and metallicity in galaxies which have no dust and follow a single - burst star formation history .",
    "hence we perform the cur matrix decomposition   on a model with known physical parameters .",
    "the @xcite stellar populations model is used . for a chosen stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and",
    "stellar isochrones , the model provides spectra of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) spanning 6  stellar metallicities by mass ( @xmath8  = 0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 , 0.05 ) and 221  stellar ages ( 0  20  gyr , distributed roughly in equally - sized logarithmic bins ) .",
    "we adopt the @xcite imf and padova  1994 isochrones , and these choices are not expected to impact our results qualitatively .",
    "we do not add extinction to our model . and",
    ", there is no stellar velocity dispersion variance in our model , in contrast to the galaxy spectra used the lick / ids   indices measurement @xcite .",
    "we choose not to study the effect of noise and other artifacts on the identified regions , because other approaches ( e.g. , robust pca   by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be used to derive robust eigenspectra and eigencoefficients @xcite for regions in real galaxy spectra .",
    "the @xcite model has solar abundance ratios , which may limit the application of our regions from many early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) having non - solar values .",
    "we decide to identify a new set of regions when a more sophisciated stellar populations model is available in the future .",
    "a preprocessing is carried out to ensure that ( i ) each and every spectrum is unique   sense , despite the fact that they have different ages . for a given metallicity",
    ", we retain the spectrum at the earlier age when a pair of spectra at two _ consecutive _ ages are the same .",
    "the real degeneracies between age and metallicity still remain .",
    "] , ( ii ) all of the flux values are available ( i.e. , no nan , and no zero vector ) , and ( iii ) the final ages and metallicities are selected as such they follow a rectangular parameter grid .",
    "this step results in the same 6   metallicities but 182  ages ( 2.5  myr ",
    "20  gyr ) , or 1092  ssp  spectra in total .",
    "the ssp  are rebinned , in a flux - conserving fashion , to two configurations : the lick / ids  and the sdss .",
    "the lick / ids  configuration allows us to compare the identified regions to the widely used indices in the literature . on the other hand",
    ", the sdss configuration will result in regions with a spectral resolution higher than the lick / ids   indices and closer to the sdss galaxy spectra .",
    "the lick / ids   configuration is a wavelength range 38006400   , a spectral resolution of 9    fwhm , and a sampling of 1.25    per pixel .",
    "the model spectra are therefore scaled down in resolution by convolving with a gaussian function .",
    "the function has a fwhm equal to the @xcite resolution ( 3    fwhm   within the optical ) quadrature - subtracted from the targeted resolution .",
    "this choice is made to mimic the lick / ids   spectrograph configuration ( 40006400    in air wavelengths , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as to include both the left and the right flanks of @xmath0 .",
    "they are referred as the @xmath0l and @xmath0r for convenience .",
    "the sdss configuration is a wavelength range 34508350   , a spectral resolution of 3    fwhm , and a sampling of 69  km  s@xmath9 per pixel .",
    "the choice of 3    is limited by the instrumental resolution of the @xcite model .",
    "the actual spectral resolution in the sdss is 1800  ( corresponds to 166  km  s@xmath9 ) , higher than that of the model at the shortest wavelengths , and is 1.9    at @xmath10 3450   .",
    "the wavelength range is tuned to coincide with the restframe wavelength range of spectra in most nearby sdss galaxies , for which the median redshift is 0.1 .",
    "the observed - frame wavelengths of the sdss spectrograph are ranged from 38009200   .",
    "the spectra are converted from flux density ( in erg  s@xmath9  @xmath9 ) to flux ( in erg  s@xmath9 ) using @xmath11 .",
    "the data values , which will be cast into a matrix later , are in the flux unit .",
    "the mean spectrum of the model is subtracted from each ssp   spectrum . the data cloud formed by the spectra",
    "are hence centered in the wavelength space .",
    "the spectra are not continuum subtracted , as such no assumption on the true continuum is made .",
    "we assemble the 21   lick / ids   indices from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their whole table  2 ) , the 4  indices from ( * ? ? ?",

    "the details are listed table  [ tab : lick ] .",
    "the cur matrix decomposition   @xcite is a novel method that has been used for large - scale data analysis in multiple disciplines .",
    "the main idea is to approximate a potentially huge data matrix with a lower rank matrix , where the latter is made with a small number of _ actual _ rows and/or columns of the original data matrix .",
    "the selected rows and columns are therefore statistically informative .",
    "the data in this work are model spectra , selecting the rows and columns corresponds to selecting the spectrum ids and wavelengths , respectively .",
    "we will use only the column part of the decomposition , selecting informative wavelengths in the spectra .",
    "further details of the cur matrix decomposition   are presented in appendix  [ appendix : cur ] .",
    "we start by constructing a @xmath14 data matrix @xmath15 , where each row is a single ssp  spectrum from the model spectra .",
    "that is , @xmath16 is the flux of the @xmath17th spectrum at the @xmath18th wavelength",
    ". the full set of model spectra (  [ section : data ] ) is used , so that the sample variance in the matrix is driven by both stellar age and metallicity .",
    "a singular value decomposition ( svd ) is performed on @xmath15@xmath19    which gives @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the orthonormal matrices in which the columns are respectively the left and right singular vectors ; and @xmath22 , the diagonal matrix containing the singular values . for a chosen @xmath23 ,",
    "the _ leveragescore _  at a given wavelength is @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the @xmath18th right singular vector . the collection of the @xmath23 right singular vectors forms an orthonormal basis to the fluxes in the high - dimensional wavelength space .",
    "the larger the @xmath25 value , the larger the sample variance is projected from the @xmath18th basis vector onto the given wavelength axis .",
    "the @xmath26  is hence proportional to the total projected sample variance from altogether @xmath23 basis vectors onto that wavelength axis . in other words",
    ", @xmath26  measures the information contained in a wavelength .",
    "this information tells the sample variance driven by the physical parameters , stellar age and metallicity .",
    "the ordering of the spectra per row in the matrix @xmath15  does not impact the ordering of the right singular vectors .",
    "as long as the same set of spectra is used , and the same @xmath23 is chosen , the same @xmath26  will result .",
    "the @xmath23 values will be chosen in an objective manner in this work .",
    "the two main steps in the region  identification are to select the informative wavelength , @xmath27 , and to determine its region of influence , roi . to select @xmath27 , we pick from the available wavelengths the one with the highest @xmath26 . to determine the roi , we observe several guidelines : ( a ) a region   is contiguous in wavelength",
    "( b ) a region   is allowed to be asymmetric about @xmath27 .",
    "( c ) regions can overlap with each other .",
    "( d ) we expect that , if a region can indeed be defined , the @xmath26   would decline to zero when approaching the left and right wavelength bounds , because the fluxes combining the above considerations , a roi  is calculated as follows .",
    "starting at the wavelength that is selected ( @xmath27 ) , we attempt to include a pixel to its immediate left or right .",
    "the accumulated @xmath26of both scenarios are calculated , called @xmath28 .",
    "the pixel gives the higher @xmath28  is added to the region .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the last ( @xmath17th ) pixel is included , as such the following convergence criterion is satisfied @xmath29    that is , the change of the information content of a region  per unit wavelength is a constant .",
    "we tie the constant to the average information expected in the case where every wavelength is equally informative .",
    "the threshold , @xmath30 , is set to be 0.7   in this work .",
    "this value is not unity , consistent with the fact that the @xmath26   are not uniform .",
    "more importantly , this choice enables us to obtain converged nad - region   width (  [ section : results ] ) for both the lick / ids   and the sdss configurations ( figure  [ fig : regionwidth_nad_vs_k_t0.70_lick ] and figure  [ fig : regionwidth_nad_vs_k_t0.70_sdss ] , respectively ) .",
    "the atomic lines , such as nad , have well - defined central wavelengths and widths .",
    "they are therefore good standards for checking various identification approaches . for @xmath30=",
    "0.7  @xmath31 0.1  also give the width convergence in the sdss configuration .",
    "the generality of this convergence for arbitrary spectra is however not yet established .",
    "a roi  is fully indicated by the left and right wavelength bounds [ @xmath32 .",
    "once the @xmath27  and the [ @xmath32  are determined , they are labeled as a `` region '' and all of the involved pixels are masked out in the next @xmath27   and roi   selection .",
    "the process is repeated until either no more pixels are available , or the desired number of regions is reached .",
    "we then use @xmath33    as the measure for the information contained in a region .",
    "pca  has become a standard technique in spectral analyses . in extragalactic studies ,",
    "it has been applied to remove sky from galaxy spectra @xcite , to understand the diversity in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to separate host galaxy contribution from broadline agn spectra @xcite , and to find supernovae in large galaxy spectral samples @xcite , and many more studies .",
    "these works used the fact that pca  compresses the data in the _ object  space _ , leaving the number of wavelength bins in each eigenspectrum unchanged from that of the input spectra .",
    "the cur matrix decomposition  provides us a new way to compress the data , so that even the _ variable  space _ can be compressed .",
    "the variable in the current context is the wavelength .",
    "the next step is to compare the regions quantitatively .",
    "we prepare spectral segments of each region   that are _ cut out _ from the model spectra .",
    "the set of cutouts of each region  form a column subspace ( in @xmath34 ) of the original @xmath35 data matrix @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the number of cutout pixels is less than the number of spectra in this work .",
    "therefore , the rank of the subspace , at maximum , is equal to the number of pixels of that region .",
    "its actual value would depend on the dimension of the subspace in question .",
    "three subspace measures are used : ( i ) the cosine of the angle between two subspaces as defined by @xcite , @xmath36 .",

    "iii ) the pearson correlation coefficient between the integrated fluxes of the two regions , figure  [ fig : ar_age_orig_region1_jhu_k25.ecoeff_eigen1_z__allbins ] ) , we will show a  posteriori that the pearson correlation coefficient , a good measure for linear correlation , is unlikely to be the best for probing the relation among regions .",
    "] , @xmath38 .    the subspace measure ( i )",
    "is calculated as follows . for the @xmath17th region   with number of wavelength bins equal to @xmath39",
    ", we cut out from the original data matrix @xmath15 the corresponding submatrix @xmath40 , size @xmath41 .",
    "a svd  is performed on the submatrix , @xmath42 .",
    "the angle between the @xmath17th and the @xmath18th regions , with @xmath43 , is calculated by applying the formula in @xcite @xmath44    where we put the matrix @xmath45 .",
    "the symbol @xmath46 denotes the determinant , and @xmath30 the transpose , of a matrix .",
    "they have shown that @xmath36   is proportional to the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the projection of the basis vectors of the lower - dimensional subspace on the higher - dimensional subspace .",
    "the one dimensional ( 1d ) case is helpful for us to grasp the picture : the matrix product @xmath47 becomes the dot product between the two 1d basis vectors .    from the svd  of the regions we can also calculate the dot product between the first left - singular vectors of any two regions , i.e. , the subspace measure ( ii ) .",
    "indeed , any order of singular vector can be considered , but we pick the first vector because it captures the maximum sample variance .      to associate physical significance with the regions , we explore the correlation between a chosen parameterization of a region  and the physical parameters defining the model .",

    ", the correlation between two variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( each has @xmath50 components , @xmath50 being the number of spectra / objects ) is equivalent to the dot product between two vectors in the object  space   ( each vector has @xmath50 components ) .",
    "we hereafter use `` the correlation between two subspaces ( in the variable  space ) '' and `` the angle between two subspaces ( in the object  space ) '' interchangeably .",

    "this result shows that region01   is more `` complete '' than the @xmath0 , in the sense that the corresponding subspace encapsulates most of the data directions .",
    "the other pronounced difference between the extended  lick / ids  indices   and the regions is that , in the former , there are many more cases where two indices are orthogonal .",

    "large correlation amplitude is seen between most region  pairs . using the integrated flux or the first singular vector to represent a subspace",
    "hence convey less information about that subspace than using a number of singular vectors .",
    "this result is not surprising , because the integrated flux does not fully describe a region , or in fact any spectrum .",
    "this result also justifies the use of the pca   to determine physical parameters from a galaxy spectrum .",
    "interestingly , from figure  [ fig : cutout_jhu_k25_sorted_corrcoeff ] we also find both measures to be similar .",
    "a mathematical explanation is however not yet explored .",
    "the parameter sensitivity of the regions  are given in the last few columns of table  [ tab : lickconf ] and table  [ tab : sdssconf ] , respectively for the lick / ids  and sdss configurations .",
    "all regions are sensitive to stellar age  to the first order , and to either stellar age  or stellar metallicity  to the second order . @xcite",
    "have also shown that age is the main parameter driving the variance in the spectra of local galaxies .",
    "we expect some regions will be sensitive to the stellar metallicity to the first order if the input spectra were continuum subtracted , taking out the sample variance that is primarily due to stellar age . while this is an interesting alternative to the data centering ( in the preprocessing ,  [ section : data ] ) , care must be taken to propagate the uncertainty of the estimated continuum into the regions identification .",
    "we then perform a pca   on the cutouts from region01   in the sdss configuration and relate the eigencoefficients to stellar age and metallicity .",
    "the eigenspectra are shown in appendix  [ appendix : espec ] .",
    "focusing on the lowest orders of eigencoefficients , shown in figure  [ fig : ar_age_orig_region1_jhu_k25.ecoeff_eigen1_z__allbins ] , the first eigencoefficient correlates well with the stellar age regardless of the stellar metallicity , and the second eigencoefficient with the stellar metallicity _",
    "after the age is known_. these results agree with those obtained from the parameter sensitivity analysis that are shown in the last few columns of table  [ tab : sdssconf ] . the determination of stellar age from the first eigencoefficient appears to work best for intermediate ages , which is not surprising considering the optical spectra of galaxies dominated by old ( @xmath59 a few  gyr ) stellar populations look alike , posing a well - known limitation on the determination of stellar age in galaxies from optical spectra .",
    "we also found a similar situation for galaxies dominated by very young populations ( @xmath60 10  myr ) , where spectra of two different ages can show the same first - eigencoefficient amplitude .",
    "interestingly , we have to know the stellar age before we can tell the stellar metallicity , in other words , they have to be determined simultaneously , which is a manifestation of the well - known `` age - metallicity degeneracy '' problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in galaxy parameter estimation . to conclude",
    ", we can use the regional eigencoefficients to determine the stellar age and metallicity in early - type galaxies which have solar abundance ratios , no dust , and a single - burst star formation history .",
    "it remains to be seen how the parameters which are relevant to late - type galaxies , such as the exponentially decreasing star formation rate and the dust extinction , depend on the eigencoefficients of a region .",
    "we identify informative wavelength regions in a single - burst stellar populations model by using the cur matrix decomposition   @xcite .",
    "the regions are objective .",
    "they are shown to be sensitive to stellar age and metallicity .",
    "the regions can be used to determine the stellar age and metallicity in early - type galaxies which have solar abundance ratios , no dust , and a single - burst star formation history .",
    "the region   identification method and the subspace analysis can be applied to any set of spectra of the user s interest , so that we eliminate the need for a common , fixed resolution index system .",
    "we plan to extend this analysis to late - type galaxies .",
    "the presence of emission lines pose special challenges to the region   identification on the whole spectra , namely , the continuum + absorption + emission spectra .",
    "this speculation is hinted by the fact that the continuum - included strong emission lines can not be reconstructed with higher than  accuracy on average by using a handful of lower - order eigenspectra @xcite .",
    "we are investigating this question .",
    "a possible approach is that of @xcite who parameterized the continuum - subtracted emission - line ews through a handful of eigenspectra . to this end",
    ", the sdss galaxies will be a perfect dataset . because of the many galaxy types , a large diversity in the emission lines and the associated gas kinematics can be studied .",
    "a set of regions , taken into account of both absorption and emission lines , will give a comprehensive parametrization to emission - line galaxy spectra .",
    "the progress on understanding galaxy parameters have already set benchmarks in the field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this work provides a factor of @xmath61  reduction over the original data .",

    "the cur matrix decomposition   @xcite computes a low - rank approximation to an arbitrary matrix that marvels the optimal low - rank approximation provided by the truncated singular value decomposition ( svd ) .",

    "the cur matrix decomposition   has been used in genetics to identify `` pca - correlated snps '' , basically the most informative columns within dna single - nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) matrices  @xcite ; and it has been central to recent work in developing randomized algorithms for the low - rank approximation of very large matrices  @xcite .    the main idea behind the cur matrix decomposition  is to decompose a given matrix @xmath15 into matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 which consist of respectively a small number of actual columns and rows of @xmath15 , and a low - dimensional encoding matrix @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 as follows    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the best rank-@xmath23 approximation to @xmath15 , as given by the truncated svd .",

    "we see from figure  [ fig : espec_orig_region1_jhu_k25_mean_and_espec ] that the first and second eigenspectra modulate respectively the balmer  absorption  and the 4000    break   strengths . on the other hand , we know from the parameter dependence in figure  [ fig : ar_age_orig_region1_jhu_k25.ecoeff_eigen1_z__allbins ] that first eigenspectrum of the single - burst stellar populations model tells primarily the stellar age .",
