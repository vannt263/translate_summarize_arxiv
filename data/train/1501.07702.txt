    "magnetic structures in the form of holes or humps associated with maxima or minima of plasma density and pressure are often encountered in planetary magnetosheafs close to both the bow - shock and the magnetopause , and in the solar wind ( see e.g. @xcite ) as well .",
    "these structures are often viewed as ultra - low frequency ( ulf ) waves resulting from the mirror instability ( mi ) @xcite , and , by this reason , called mirror structures .",
    "this instability develops in a collisionless plasma characterized by a relatively large @xmath0 ( a few units ) and a transverse ( usually ionic ) temperature @xmath1 larger than the parallel one @xmath2 , such that the condition for mirror instability @xmath3is fulfilled . here",
    "@xmath4 ( similarly , @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6@xmath7and @xmath8@xmath9 are the perpendicular and parallel plasma pressures respectively .    in the earth magnetosheath ,",
    "a typical depth of magnetic holes is about 20% of the mean magnetic field value and can sometimes achieve 50 % .",
    "the characteristic width of such structures is of the order of a few ion larmor radii , and they display an aspect ratio of about 7 - 10 . in solar wind , according to @xcite , the size of holes may be very different , varying from 10 up to 1000 ion gyroradii . in magnetosheath ,",
    "holes and humps have comparable size . and amplitudes .",
    "humps are often observed near the magnetopause where conditions ( [ thr ] ) for development of the mi can be met under the effect of the plasma compression .",
    "mirror structures are also observed when the plasma is linearly stable @xcite , which may be viewed as the signature of a bistability regime resulting from a subcritical bifurcation , whose existence was interpreted on the basis of a simple energetic argument within the simplified description of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the linear mirror instability has been extensively studied both analytically ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and by means of particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite .",
    "as shown in hasegawa , hall , pokhotelovsagdeev , the instability is arrested at large @xmath10 due to finite ion larmor radius ( flr ) effects .",
    "it turns out that wave - particle resonance plays a central role in driving the instability , while the flr effects are at the origin of the quenching of the instability at small scales .",
    "in contrast , a few years ago , a theoretical understanding of the nonlinear phase remained limited to phenomenological modeling of particle trapping @xcite that hardly reproduce simulations of vlasov - maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "the first nonlinear theory was formulated in @xcite where we developed a weakly nonlinear approach to the mirror instability based on the mixed hydrodynamic - kinetic description . for the sake of simplicity , an electron - proton plasma with cold electrons",
    "was considered first .",
    "it includes the force - balance equation within the anisotropic mhd and the drift kinetic equation for the ions .",
    "close to threshold , the unstable modes have wavevectors almost perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the ion larmor radius ) , so that the perturbations can be described using a long - wave approximation .",
    "the latter allows one to apply the drift kinetic equation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) to estimate the main nonlinear effects that correspond to a local shift of the instability threshold ( [ thr ] ) .",
    "all other nonlinearities connected , for example , with ion inertia are smaller . as the result , it is possible to derive an asymptotic equation with quadratic nonlinearity of generalized gradient type @xcite .",
    "the latter property implies an irreversible character of the mirror modes behavior , associated with ion landau damping , where the free energy ( or lyapunov functional ) can only decrease in time . in this framework , above threshold , the mirror modes have a blow - up behavior with a possible saturation at an amplitude level comparable to that of the ambient field . below threshold , all stationary ( localized ) structures",
    "were predicted to be unstable .",
    "thus , the system near the mi threshold displays a behavior typical of a subcritical bifurcation when the small - amplitude stationary solutions below threshold turn out to be unstable ; above threshold , the amplitude of magnetic field perturbations tends to blow up .",
    "it is worth noting that this approach contrasts with the quasi - linear theory @xcite that also assumes vicinity of the instability threshold but , being based on a random phase approximation , can not predict the appearance of coherent structures .",
    "phenomenological models based on the cooling of trapped particles were proposed to interpret the existence of deep magnetic holes @xcitethese models do not however address the initial value problem in the mirror unstable regime .",
    "the asymptotic model @xcite was first derived under the assumption of cold electrons . therefore , in our further papers kps2012a , kps2012b , we considered how hot electrons can be incorporated into the model .",
    "the approach we developed is based on the assumption of an adiabatically slow dynamics of the mirror structures that allows one to compute the coupling coefficient in the weakly nonlinear regime as well as to simplify all calculations of the linear growth rate in the case of bi - maxwellian distributions for both the ions and the electrons .",
    "the adiabatic hypothesis can be proved perturbatively , and is in particular valid within the asymptotic model . because this model predicts the existence of subcritcal bifurcation with a blow - up behavior above threshold , consistent with the formation of mirror structures with amplitude of the magnetic field perturbation comparable with the ambient field , our next step was to investigate the properties of possible stationary mirror structures .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofolds .",
    "the first part provides a review of our previous results concerning the weakly nonlinear model for both cold ( @xcite ) and hot ( @xcite ) electrons .",
    "another goal of this paper is to study steady mirror structures resulting from the balance of magnetic and ( both parallel and perpendicular ) thermal pressures , whose simplest description is provided by anisotropic mhd .",
    "isotropic mhd equilibria are classically governed by the grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation @xcite .",
    "we here revisit this approach in the case of anisotropic electron and ion fluids where the perpendicular and parallel pressures are given by equations of state appropriate for the static character of the solutions .",
    "however , the mhd stationary equations , at least in the two - dimensional geometry , turn out to be ill - posed . as a consequence ,",
    "these equations require some regularization . as done in a similar context of pattern formation ercolaniindiknewellpassot , an additional linear term involving a square laplacian",
    "is added . for nonlinear mirror modes",
    ", regularization can originate from finite larmor radius ( flr ) corrections , which are not retained in the present analysis based on the drift kinetic equation ( see , e.g. kps2007a , kps2007b ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the linear mirror instability near the mi threshold .",
    "section iii is devoted to the derivation of weakly nonlinear asymptotic model , in the simplest case of cold electrons , and to its properties , including possible stationary states ( below the mi threshold ) and blow - up behavior ( above threshold ) .",
    "section iv deals with accounting electrons in the asymptotic model .",
    "here we develop the adiabatic approach for finding contributions from electrons to both the linear growth rate and the nonlinear coupling coefficient entering the asymptotic model . in section",
    "v , we formulate the variational principle for the stationary anisotropic mhd when both parallel and transverse pressures depend on the magnetic field amplitude with a free energy given by the space integral of the parallel tension . in this case ,",
    "as well known @xcite , the parallel component of the mhd equation is satisfied identically . in section 6 ,",
    "the anisotropic grad - shafranov equations are revisited when the gyrotropic pressures depend only on the local magnetic field amplitude that , as shown in the forthcoming sections , is specific of nonlinear mirror modes . in this case",
    "the stationary anisotropic mhd represents an hydrodynamic integrable - type system and for this reason requires the renormalization due to flr effects . in this section , it is shown also that the equations of state resulting from an adiabatic approximation of the drift kinetic description , require a regularization because of an overestimate of the contributions from the particles with a large magnetic moment .",
    "we discuss in particular the small - amplitude regime and show that the pressure - balanced structures are then governed by the kpii equation which possesses lump solutions .",
    "numerical simulations reproduce these special structures , that turn out to be unstable .",
    "computation of stable solutions lead to large - amplitude purely one - dimensional solutions in the form of stripes that appear to be sensitive to the regularization process , an indication that the regime can not be captured by the drift kinetic approximation and that finite larmor corrections and trapped particles are to be retained . section vii aims for presentation of the numerical results for two - dimensional ( depending on @xmath15 and @xmath16 coordinates ) stationary mirror structures when the magnetic field @xmath11 has also a @xmath17 component .",
    "in particular , we show that for small @xmath18 stationary structures realizing the minimum of the free energy , below and above the threshold , have the form of stripes which are one - dimensional structures with constant magnetic field outside and inside the stripes .",
    "the transient region , between outer and inner regions , for the stripes represents the magnetic well which structure is defined by the flr contributions to the free energy . with increasing @xmath18 , instead of stripes ,",
    "the free energy has its minimum for bubble - type structures with an elliptic form .",
    "when @xmath19 these bubbles become circular .",
    "in this case , flr effects play a role of the surface tension .",
    "section viii is the conclusion .",
    "consider for the sake of simplicity , a plasma with cold electrons . to describe the mirror instability in the long - wave limit it is enough to use the drift kinetic equation for ions ignoring parallel electric field @xmath20 and transverse electric drift : @xmath21 in this approximation ions move along the magnetic field ( @xmath22 ) due to the magnetic force @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the adiabatic invariant which plays the role of a parameter in equation ( [ mainkin ] ) .",
    "both pressures @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 @xmath28 equation ( [ mainkin ] ) with relations ( [ par ] ) and ( [ perp ] ) are supplemented with the equation expressing the balance of forces in a plane transverse to the local magnetic field @xmath29 \\frac{% \\mathbf{b}\\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{b}}{4\\pi } \\big \\}=0 .",

    "the first term describes the action of the magnetic and perpendicular pressures , the second term being responsible for magnetic lines elasticity .",
    "the equation governing the mirror dynamics is then obtained perturbatively by expanding eqs .",
    "( [ mainkin ] ) and ( [ balance - nl ] ) . in this approach ,",
    "the ion pressure tensor elements are computed from the system ( [ mainkin ] ) , ( [ balance - nl ] ) , near a bi - maxwellian equilibrium state characterized by temperatures @xmath31 and @xmath2 and a constant ambient magnetic field @xmath32 taken along the @xmath33-direction .    from eq .",

    "this means that the ions contributing to the resonance @xmath46 , correspond to the maximum of the ion distribution function .    after substituting ( [ omega - kin ] ) into the first order term for perpendicular pressure ( [ perp ] ) and performing integration , we get @xmath47 the first term in ( [ first - perp ] ) is due to the difference between perpendicular and parallel pressures , while the second one accounts for the landau pole .    equation ( [ first - perp ] ) together with ( [ first ] ) yield the growth rate for the mirror instability in the drift approximation where flr corrections are neglected @xcite @xmath48 ,   \\label{growth}\\]]where @xmath49 .",
    "the instability takes place when the criterion ( [ thr ] ) is fulfilled and , near threshold , develops in quasi - perpendicular directions , making the parallel magnetic perturbation dominant .    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , when the flr corrections are relevant , the growth rate is modified into @xmath50   \\label{gamma}\\]]where @xmath51 and the ion larmor radius @xmath52 is defined with the transverse thermal velocity @xmath53 and the ion gyrofrequency @xmath54 .",
    "this growth rate can be recovered by expanding the general expression given in @xcite , in the limit of small transverse wavenumbers .",
    "it can also be obtained directly from the vlasov - maxwell ( vm ) equations in a long - wave limit which retains non gyrotropic contributions @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the expression ( [ gamma ] ) for @xmath55 is consistent with the applicability condition @xmath56 , i.e. when the supercritical parameter @xmath57 due to flr and for almost perpendicular direction in a small cone of angles , @xmath58 @xmath59 . as a result , the growth rate @xmath60 , so that , when defining new stretched variables by @xmath61it takes the form @xmath62hence it is seen that , in the ( @xmath63 ) plane ( @xmath64 ) , the instability takes place inside the unit circle : @xmath65 the maximum of @xmath66 is obtained for @xmath67 , @xmath68 @xmath69 and is equal to @xmath70 . outside the circle ,",
    "the growth rate becomes negative ( in agreement with hall ) .",
    "as it follows from ( [ first ] ) , in the linear regime , near the instability threshold , the fluctuations of perpendicular and magnetic pressures almost compensate each other ( compare with ( [ growth ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , in the nonlinear stage of this instability , we can expect that the main nonlinear contributions come from the second order corrections to the total ( perpendicular plus magnetic ) pressure , i.e. @xmath71this result can be obtained rigorously by means of a multi - scale expansion based on the linear theory scalings ( [ scaling ] ) . for this purpose , we introduce a slow time @xmath72 and slow coordinates @xmath73 in a way consistent with ( [ scaling ] ) , and expand the magnetic field fluctuations as a powers series in @xmath74 : @xmath75where @xmath76 are assumed to be functions of @xmath73 and @xmath77 . using these expressions",

    "small amplitude solutions associated to kpii lumps are obtained and shown to be unstable .",
    "based on the variational computation ( the gradient method ) of the stationary mirror structures , this instability is shown to result in appearance of one - dimensional stripes when the magnetic fields outside and inside stripes are homogeneous with a jump which structure is defined by the flr effects .",
    "such two - dimensional evolution of the stationary structures are formed for below and above threshold of the mirror instability when the @xmath632-component of magnetic field is absent .",
    "for the finite but small enough values of @xmath632 the resulting structures represent stripes . with increasing @xmath632 instead of stripes we observed in numerical simulations the formation of magnetic bubbles with the homogeneous magnetic field inside the bubbles .",

    "the magnetic field outside and inside bubbles occurs constant and undergoes jump due to the flr effects while crossing the bubble . in this case , the flr effects play the role of surface tension .",
    "note also , when considering stable subcritical structures , the drift kinetic approximation breaks down , as the deep magnetic holes obtained by a gradient method appear to be strongly sensitive to the regularization process , an effect which in a more realistic description could be provided by flr corrections and/or particle trapping .",

    "<S> in the first part of this paper we present a review of our results concerning the weakly nonlinear regime of the mirror instability in the framework of an asymptotic model . </S>",
    "<S> this model belongs to the class of gradient type systems for which the free energy can only decrease in time . </S>",
    "<S> it reveals a behavior typical for subcritical bifurcations : below the mirror instability threshold , all localized stationary structures are unstable , while above threshold , the system displays a blow - up behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that taking the electrons into account ( non - zero temperature ) does not change the structure of the asymptotic model . </S>",
    "<S> for bi - maxwellian distributions functions for both electrons and ions , the model predicts the formation of magnetic holes . </S>",
    "<S> the second part of this paper contains original results concerning two - dimensional steady mirror structures which can form in the saturated regime . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , based on grad - shafranov - like equations , a gyrotropic plasma , where the pressures in the static regime are only functions of the amplitude of the local magnetic field , is shown to be amenable to a variational principle with a free energy density given by the parallel tension . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is used to demonstrate that small - amplitude static holes constructed slightly below the mirror instability threshold identify with lump solitons of kpii equation and turn out to be unstable . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that regularizing effects such as finite larmor radius corrections can not be ignored in the description of large - amplitude mirror structures . using the gradient method , which is based on a variational principle for anisotropic mhd taking into account ion finite larmor radius effects , we found both one - dimensional magnetic structures in the form of stripes and two - dimensional bubbles when the magnetic field component transverse to the plane is increased . </S>",
