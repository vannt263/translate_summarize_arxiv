    "the average macroscopic properties of systems at thermodynamic equilibrium are independent of time .",
    "however , one should not think that thermodynamic equilibrium means absence of dynamical behaviour : at the microscopic scale , the system keeps on evolving from one micro - state to another .",
    "this never - ending motion manifests itself as _ fluctuations _ at the macroscopic scale , the most celebrated example being the brownian motion .",
    "however , one crucial feature of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium is the absence of currents in the system : there is no macroscopic transport of matter , charge , energy , momentum , spin or whatsoever within the system or between the system and its environment .",
    "this is a very fundamental property , first stated by onsager , that stems from the time - reversal symmetry of the microscopic equations of motion .",
    "this property is true both for classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "we want to describe the evolution of a complex system consisting of a very large number @xmath4 of interacting degrees of freedom . in full rigour , one should write the @xmath4-body ( quantum ) hamiltonian that incorporates the full evolution of the system under consideration . however , it is often useful to consider effective dynamical descriptions that are obtained , for example , by coarse - graining the phase - space of the system or by integrating - out fast modes . in the following",
    ", the models we shall study will follow classical markovian dynamics and we shall give a short presentation of markov systems .",
    "the interested reader can find more details , in particular about the underlying assumptions that lead to markov dynamics , in e.g. the book by n. g. van kampen @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that many properties that we shall discuss here can be generalized to other dynamical systems .",
    "the classical markov processes that we shall study here will be fully specified by a ( usually finite or numerable ) set of microstates @xmath5 . at a given time @xmath6 , the system can be found in one its microstates .",
    "the evolution of the system is specified by the following rule : between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the system can jump from a configuration @xmath8 to a configuration @xmath9 .",
    "it is assumed that the transition rate from @xmath8 to @xmath9 does not depend on the previous history of the system : this is the crucial _ markov hypothesis _ in which short time correlations are neglected .",
    "the rate of transition per unit time will be denoted by @xmath10 ( or equivalently , by @xmath11 note that this rate may vary with time and depend explicitly on @xmath6 .",
    "this case will not be considered in the present lectures .",
    "to summarize , the markov dynamics is specified by the following rules :    @xmath12    these dynamical rules can be illustrated by a network in the configuration space ( see figure  [ fig : network ] ) : the nodes of the graph are the microstates and oriented - edges , weighted by the markov rates @xmath10 represent possible transitions between configurations .        for a system with markov dynamics",
    ", one can define @xmath13 , the probability of being in the micro - state @xmath8 at time @xmath6 .",
    "this probability measure varies with time : its evolution is governed by the master equation , given by @xmath14    this equation is fundamental . to derive it",
    ", one must take into account all possible transitions between time @xmath6 and @xmath15 that involve a given configuration @xmath8 .",
    "there are two types of moves : ( i ) transitions _ into _ @xmath8 coming from a different configuration @xmath9 ; ( ii ) transitions _ out of _",
    "@xmath8 towards a different configuration @xmath9 .",
    "the moves ( i ) and ( ii ) contribute with a different sign to the change of the probability of occupying @xmath8 between time @xmath6 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that the master equation can well be interpreted as a flux - balance equation on the network of figure  [ fig : network ] .",
    "the way we have encoded the transition rates naturally suggests that the master equation can be rewritten in a matrix form .",
    "indeed , reinterpreting the rate @xmath16 as matrix - elements and defining the diagonal term @xmath17 allows us to rewrite equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) as @xmath18    we emphasize that the diagonal term @xmath19 is a negative number : it represents _ minus _ the rate of leaving the configuration @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to an important property : the sum of each column of @xmath20 identically vanishes .",
    "this property guaranties , by simple algebra , that the total probability is conserved : @xmath21 ( the initial probability distribution being normalized ) .",
    "note that there is a formal analogy between markov systems and quantum dynamics : the markov operator @xmath20 plays the role of a quantum hamiltonian .",
    "however , @xmath20 does not have to be a symmetric or hermitian matrix ( and is not , in general ) .",
    "there are numerous examples of markov processes in statistical physics .",
    "the paradigm is certainly the simple symmetric random walk on a discrete lattice ( see figure  [ fig : random walk ] ) . here",
    ", the configurations are the lattice sites and the transition rates are constant and uniform ( i.e. translation - invariant ) .",
    "the corresponding markov equation is the discrete laplace equation on the lattice .",
    "another important example is given by langevin dynamics ( see figure  [ fig:2well ] ) .",
    "it was originally invented by paul langevin as mechanical model for the brownian motion but stochastic dynamics has become a widely studied subject , that allows for instance to model the effects of noise in mechanical and electric devices .",
    "the basic idea is to incorporate a random force that represents thermal noise into classical newtonian dynamics : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a gaussian white noise of amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "the state of a particle is a point in phase - space , i.e a configuration is specified by the position and the velocity ( or momentum ) of the particle ( the set of possible configurations is continuous and non - enumerable ) .",
    "the corresponding markov equation for the probability distribution function @xmath25 , of being at @xmath26 with velocity @xmath27 , is known as the fokker - planck equation : @xmath28 the role of the markov matrix is played by the fokker - planck operator @xmath29 .",
    "there are many formal similarities between the fokker - planck equation and the discrete markov dynamics given by  ( [ eq : markovmatrix ] ) ; however , subtle mathematical issues can arise in the case of a continuous configuration space that require the use of functional analysis .",
    "both markov and fokker - planck dynamics are mathematical models , that can be defined and studied without any specific reference to physical principles .",
    "however , to be physically relevant , these dynamics should be connected to the laws of thermodynamics and statistical physics . in particular",
    ", one can impose that the steady state of these equations is an equilibrium - state : in other words , the stationary probability distribution must be identical to the boltzmann - gibbs canonical law .    for a discrete markov dynamics  ( [ eq : markovmatrix ] ) , this condition reads @xmath30 this is a set of global constraints on the rates , which is sometimes called the ` global balance ' condition .",
    "similarly , in the langevin case , one imposes that the invariant measure of phase - space is given by @xmath31 writing that this formula is the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation , one observes that this fixes the the noise - amplitude @xmath24 as a function of temperature @xmath32 this is in essence the reasoning followed by langevin in his study of the free brownian motion ( for which the external potential vanishes @xmath33 ) .",
    "substituting the value of @xmath24 in the corresponding fokker - planck equation leads to @xmath34    multiplying both sides of this equation by @xmath35 and integrating over phase - space allows us to show that @xmath36 using stokes formula @xmath37 for the friction - coefficient ( coefficient of the linearized force felt by a sphere of radius @xmath38 , dragged at velocity @xmath27 , in a liquid of viscosity @xmath39 ) , leads to the celebrated formula of einstein ( 1905 ) for the diffusion constant of the brownian motion , in terms of the avogadro number .",
    "we now discuss a fundamental characteristic of equilibrium dynamics that was first investigated by l. onsager .",
    "again , the property discovered by onsager is a very general one .",
    "we shall present it here on markov dynamics .",
    "the master equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) can be written in the following manner @xmath40 where we have introduced the local probability current @xmath41 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see figure  [ fig : probcourant ] ) .",
    ".,height=126 ]    when the stationary state is reached , we know that the right - hand side of this equation must vanish .",
    "however , equilibrium is a very particular stationary state : at equilibrium the microscopic dynamics of the system is _ time - reversible_. this symmetry property implies that all the _ local _ currents @xmath41 vanish separately ( onsager ) : @xmath42 this is the * detailed balance equation .",
    "* we emphasize that detailed balance is a very _ strong property _ goes beyond the laws of classical thermodynamics .",
    "we shall now explain the mathematical relation between detailed balance and time - reversal .",
    "the main - idea is to use the transition rates to construct a probability measure on time - trajectories of the system .",
    "the two important mathematical properties we shall use are the following :    \\1 .",
    "probability of remaining in @xmath8 during a time interval @xmath43 : @xmath44 2 .",
    "probability of going from @xmath8 to @xmath8 during @xmath45 : @xmath46    relation 1 can be derived by calculating the probability of staying in the same configuration between @xmath6 and @xmath15 and integrating over @xmath47 .",
    "relation 2 is simply the definition of the transition rates in a markov process .",
    "let us now consider a ` history ' of the system between the initial time 0 and the final @xmath0 . during this interval of time",
    ", the system follows a trajectory : it begins with a configuration @xmath48 , then at a date @xmath49 it jumps into configuration @xmath50 , stays there till @xmath51 and jumps to @xmath52 and so on .",
    "this special trajectory , denoted by @xmath53 is depicted in figure  [ fig : trajectory ] .",
    "$ ] .,height=188 ]    using the relations 1 and 2 above , we can calculate the weight of this specific trajectory @xmath54 , i.e the probability @xmath55 of observing @xmath54 , in the equilibrium state .",
    "the only extra ingredient we need to include is the fact that the initial condition @xmath56 at @xmath57 is chosen according to the equilibrium measure .",
    "we thus have    @xmath58    for any given trajectory @xmath54 , a time - reversed trajectory can be defined as @xmath59 .",
    "this is a bona - fide history of the system ( see figure  [ fig : trajectoryreversed ] ) and one can calculate the probability of observing it :    @xmath60        if we now calculate the ratio of these two probabilities i.e. the ratio of the probability observing a given history @xmath54 by that of observing the reversed history @xmath61 , we obtain _ the ratio between the probabilities of forward and backward trajectories : _ @xmath62 using recursively the _ detailed balance condition : _ @xmath63 and zipping it through the previous result leads us to the following remarkable identity @xmath64 _ hence , detailed balance implies that the dynamics is time reversible . _ the converse property is true : if we want that a dynamics to be time - reversal invariant , then the detailed balance relation must be satisfied ( consider simply a history in which there occurs a single transition between two configurations @xmath8 and @xmath65 ) .    to conclude , the detailed balance relation is a profound property of the equilibrium state that reflects time - reversal invariance of the dynamics .",
    "this relation is now taken as a definition for the concept of equilibrium : * a stationary state is an equilibrium state if and only if detailed balance is satisfied . *",
    "in nature , many systems are far from thermodynamic equilibrium and keep on exchanging matter , energy , information with their surroundings .",
    "there is no general conceptual framework to study such systems .",
    "a basic example of a nonequilibrium process is a conductor , or a pipe , in contact with two reservoirs at different temperatures , or electrical or chemical potential . in the stationary state",
    ", a non - vanishing steady - state current will flow from the reservoir at higher potential towards the one at lower potential .",
    "this current clearly breaks time reversal invariance . in the vicinity of equilibrium ,",
    "linear response theories allow us to predict the statistical behaviour of this current and to derive analytically the response coefficients ( conductance , susceptibilities ) from the knowledge of equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "however , one may wonder if a general microscopic theory , not obtained by a perturbative expansion in the vicinity of equilibrium , may be constructed . at present no such framework exists . however , in the last two decades , important progress and convincing proposals for a general description of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics have been made .",
    "we shall describe some of these theories in these lectures .",
    "our main inspiration in this section is the two review papers by b. derrida @xcite .    for the moment being , we use the ` pipe model ' ( see figure  [ fig : courant ] ) as a paradigmatic illustration of stationary non - equilibrium behaviour and let us formulate some very basic questions :    * what are the _ relevant macroscopic parameters _ ?",
    "how many macroscopic observables should we include to have a fair description of the system ? * which _ functions _ describe the state of a system ?",
    "can the stationary state be derived by optimizing a potential ?",
    "* do _ universal laws _",
    "can one define universality classes for systems out of equilibrium ?",
    "are there some general equations of state ? * can one postulate a general form for the _ microscopic measure _ that would generalize the gibbs - boltzmann canonical law ? * what do the statistical properties of the current in the stationary state look like ( in particular , are the current fluctuations brownian - like ) ?     flows . this pipe paradigm will be used as a leitmotiv throughout the text.,height=94 ]      large deviation functions ( ldfs ) are important mathematical objects , used in probability theory , that are becoming widely used in statistical physics .",
    "large deviation functions are used to quantify rare events that , typically , have exponentially vanishing probabilities .",
    "we shall introduce this concept through an elementary example .",
    "a very useful review on large deviations has recently been written by h. touchette @xcite .",
    "let @xmath66 be @xmath4 independent binary variables , @xmath67 , with probability @xmath68 ( resp .",
    "@xmath69 their sum is denoted by @xmath70 . we know",
    ", from the law of large numbers that @xmath71 almost surely .",
    "besides , the central limit theorem tells us that the fluctuations of the sum @xmath72 are of the order @xmath73 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath74/\\sqrt{4pqn}$ ] converges towards a normalized gaussian law .",
    "one may ask a more refined question : how fast is the convergence implied by the law of large numbers ?",
    "in other words , what does the probability that @xmath75 assumes a non - typical value look like when @xmath76 ? for the example , we consider , elementary combinatorics shows that for @xmath77 , in the large @xmath4 limit , we have @xmath78 where the positive function @xmath79 vanishes for @xmath80 .",
    "this is an elementary example of a large deviation behaviour .",
    "the function @xmath79 is a called a rate function or a _ large deviation function . _",
    "it encodes the probability of rare events . a simple application of stirling s formula yields @xmath81    we have discussed a very specific example but large deviations appear in many different contexts .",
    "we now consider an asymmetric random walker on a one - dimensional lattice with anisotropic hopping rates to neighbouring sites , given by @xmath68 and @xmath82 ( see figure  [ fig : rdmwlkasym ] ) .",
    "the average speed of the walker is given by @xmath83 : if @xmath84 is the ( random ) position of the walker at time @xmath6 we have for @xmath85 @xmath86    we can define a large deviation function @xmath87 by the following relation : @xmath88 valid in the limit of large times .     and",
    "@xmath82 respectively .",
    "the average speed of the walker is given by @xmath89.,height=132 ]    this function can be calculated explicitly .",
    "it is given by :    @xmath90    note that    * @xmath87 is a positive function that vanishes at @xmath91 .",
    "* @xmath87 is convex .",
    "* @xmath92 * using the definition of the large deviation function , we observe that , in the long time limit , the previous identity implies @xmath93    our third example is closer to physics .",
    "let us consider a gas , at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature t , consisting of @xmath4 molecules enclosed in a vessel of total volume @xmath94 .",
    "the average density is @xmath95 .",
    "we wish to probe local density fluctuations .",
    "we consider an imaginary volume @xmath96 , containing a large number of molecules but remaining much smaller than the total volume , i.e. such that @xmath97 .",
    "counting the number @xmath98 of molecules in @xmath96 will give us an empirical density @xmath99 ( see figure  [ fig : gasldf ] ) .",
    "clearly , for @xmath96 large enough the empirical density @xmath100 will be very close to @xmath101 and typical fluctuations will scale as @xmath102 . what is the probability that @xmath100 significantly deviates from @xmath101 ?    the probability of observing large fluctuations again satisfies a large deviation behaviour : @xmath103        in order to determine @xmath104 , we must count the fraction of the configurations of the gas in which there are @xmath105 particles in the small volume @xmath106 and @xmath107 particles in the rest of the volume @xmath108 .",
    "suppose that the interactions of the gas molecules are local .",
    "then , neglecting surface effects , this number is given by @xmath109 finally , we use that by definition , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the inverse temperature and @xmath112 is the free energy per unit volume and perform an expansion for @xmath113 .",
    "this leads to @xmath114    we emphasize that this large deviation function is very closely related to the thermodynamic free energy .",
    "a more general question would be the large deviation of a density profile .",
    "suppose we fully cover the large box with @xmath115 small boxes .",
    "what is the probability of observing an empirical density @xmath116 in the first box , @xmath117 in the second box etc ... ?",
    "here again , we can show that a large deviation principle is satisfied : @xmath118 where the large deviation function @xmath119 depends on @xmath120 variables .",
    "a reasoning similar to the one above allows us to show that @xmath121 taking the infinite volume limit , we obtain @xmath122    if now , we let the number @xmath120 of boxes go to infinity , then the question we are asking is the probability of observing a given density profile @xmath123 in the big volume @xmath94 . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the large deviation function @xmath125 becomes a _",
    "functional of the density profile : _",
    "@xmath126 = \\beta \\int dx    \\left (   f(\\rho(x ) , t)-   f(\\rho_0 , t)\\right ) } } \\ ] ] @xmath127 being , as above , the _ free energy per unit volume_. we conclude that the free energy of thermodynamics could have been defined _ ab initio _ as a large deviation function .",
    "more generally , all thermodynamic potentials can be realized as large deviation functions .",
    "however , the concept of large deviations does not pertain to equilibrium .",
    "large deviation functions can be introduced for very general processes , even far from equilibrium .",
    "they are positive functions that attain their minimum for when their argument takes the typical stationary variable .",
    "these remarks suggest that these functions _ may _ be used as potentials in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "let @xmath84 be a variable that satisfies a large deviation principle in the limit @xmath85 : @xmath128 where the large deviation function @xmath129 is positive and vanishes at @xmath130 .",
    "another way to encode the statistics of @xmath84 is to study its moment - generating function , defined as the average value @xmath131 expanding with respect of @xmath132 , we get @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the @xmath135-th cumulant of @xmath84 .    from the large deviation principle , we can show the following behaviour : @xmath136 this implies that all all cumulants of @xmath84 grow linearly with time and their values are given by the successive derivatives of @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , the cumulant generating function @xmath138 and the large deviation function @xmath129 are related by legendre transform .",
    "this can be seen by using the saddle - point method : @xmath139 from this relation we conclude that , @xmath140    in the following examples , we shall often calculate @xmath138 first and then determine @xmath141 by a legendre transformation .      we have shown that detailed balance is a fingerprint of equilibrium .",
    "conversely , out of equilibrium , time reversibility and detailed balance are broken . a priori",
    ", one could imagine that any arbitrary markov operator could represent a physical system far from equilibrium .",
    "this is not the case : the fundamental laws of physics are time - reversible ( leaving apart some aspects of weak - interaction ) .",
    "it is only after a coarse - graining procedure , when non - relevant degrees of freedom are integrated out , that the resulting effective dynamics appears to be irreversible for the restricted degrees of freedom we are interested in and for the space and time scales that we are considering .",
    "nevertheless , whatever coarse - grained description is chosen at a macroscopic scale , a signature of this fundamental time - reversibility of physics must remain . in other words , in order to have a sound physical model , even very far from equilibrium , detailed balance can not be violated in an arbitrary manner : there is a ` natural way ' of generalizing detailed balance .",
    "we shall investigate here what happens to detailed balance for a system connected to unbalanced reservoirs ( as in the pipe paradigm ) .",
    "we first reformulate the equilibrium detailed balance , to make generalizations more transparent .",
    "0.3 cm    * the equilibrium case : * 0.3 cm    a system is a thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at @xmath0 satisfies the detailed balance with respect to the boltzmann weights .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : detbal ] ) becomes @xmath142    equivalently , defining @xmath143 which represents the energy exchanged between the system and the reservoir at a transition from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , the above equation becomes @xmath144 where we have added an index to keep track of the exchanges of energy .",
    "0.3 cm    * the non - equilibrium case : * 0.3 cm    consider now a system @xmath145 in contact with _ two _ reservoirs @xmath146 and @xmath147 at @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "suppose that during an elementary step of the process , the system can exchange energy ( or matter ... ) @xmath150 with the first reservoir and @xmath151 with the second one . then , generalized detailed balance is given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "this equation can be obtained by the following physical reasoning .",
    "consider the global system @xmath155",
    ": this is an isolated system , its total energy @xmath156 is conserved by the dynamics . considered as a whole , the global system is governed by a reversible dynamics and in the infinite time limit it will reach the microcanonical measure .",
    "besides , its dynamics must satisfy detailed balance with respect to this microcanonical measure .",
    "this condition is expressed as @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are the entropies of the reservoirs ( i .. e the logarithms of the phase - space volumes ) .",
    "using the fact that the reservoirs are at well - defined temperatures and that energy exchanges with the system are small ( i.e. @xmath160 ) , we can expand the entropy variations of each reservoir and this leads us to equation  ( [ eq : gdb ] ) .",
    "we give now a more abstract formulation of generalized detailed balance in which energy exchanges with the reservoirs are replaced by the flux of an arbitrary quantity @xmath161 ( it can be a mass , a charge , an entropy ... ) . let us suppose that during an elementary transition from @xmath8 to @xmath9 between @xmath6 and @xmath162 , the observable @xmath161 , is incremented by @xmath163 : @xmath164    we shall also assume that @xmath161 is odd with respect to time - reversal , i.e. by time reversal , the increment @xmath163 changes its sign : @xmath165    a generalized detailed balance relation with respect to @xmath161 will be satisfied if there exists a constant @xmath166 such that the transition rates satisfy @xmath167    this formula can be further extended by considering multiple exchanges of various quantities between different reservoirs : the statement of generalized detailed balance becomes @xmath168      we shall now discuss a very important property of systems out of equilibrium , known as the fluctuation theorem .",
    "this relation was derived by g. gallavotti and e. d. g. cohen @xcite . here",
    ", we follow the proof of the fluctuation theorem for valid for markov processes that was given by lebowitz and spohn @xcite a crucial emphasis is put on the generalized detailed balance relation .",
    "the idea is to investigate how the generalized detailed balance equation  ( [ eq : ygdpoury ] ) modifies the reasoning of in section  [ subsec : detailedb ] , where we showed that detailed balance and time reversibility are equivalent .    as in section  [ subsec : detailedb ] , we consider a trajectory ( or history ) of the system between time 0 and @xmath0 .",
    "now , for each jump between two configurations , we also keep track of the increment in the quantity @xmath161 for which the generalized detailed balance equation  ( [ eq : ygdpoury ] ) is valid ( see figure  [ fig : ft ] ) .    .",
    "at each transition , the observable @xmath169 is incremented by a quantity @xmath163.,height=207 ]    as in section  [ subsec : detailedb ] , we compute the ratio between the probabilities of forward and backward trajectories : equation  ( [ eq : ratiofb ] ) is not modified ( it is true for any markov process ) .",
    "but , now , we simplify this ratio by using the generalized detailed balance equation  ( [ eq : ygdpoury ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath170 where @xmath171 represents the total quantity of @xmath169 transferred when the system follows the trajectory @xmath53 between 0 and @xmath0 .    here",
    ", the ratio between the forward and backward probabilities is different from unity .",
    "the dynamics is not reversible anymore and the breaking of time - reversal is precisely quantified by the total flux of @xmath169 .",
    "recall that @xmath169 is odd , under time reversal .",
    "hence , we have @xmath172    it is now useful to define the auxiliary quantity : @xmath173    the quantity @xmath174 is again odd w.r.t . time - reversal and",
    "it satisfies @xmath175 or , equivalently , @xmath176 summing over all possible histories between time 0 and @xmath6 , leads us to @xmath177 interpreting both sides as average values , we obtain @xmath178 this is the statement of the fluctuation theorem in laplace space , for the auxiliary variable @xmath179 .",
    "the quantities @xmath180 and @xmath161 grow with time , linearly in general .",
    "their difference remains , generically , bounded ( beware : this could be untrue for some specific systems where ` condensation ' in some specific configurations occurs .",
    "we assume here this does not happen ) .",
    "this implies that , in the long time limit , @xmath180 and @xmath161 have the same statistical behaviour and therefore @xmath181    inserting now the typical behaviour  ( [ eq : defemu ] ) derived in section  [ subsec : cumulants ] , @xmath182 we conclude that @xmath183    a legendre transform yields the * gallavotti - cohen fluctuation theorem * for the large deviation function @xmath184 using the large deviation principle , this identity implies @xmath185    this relation is the generic way of stating the fluctuation theorem .",
    "it compares the probability of occurrence of an event ( for example , a total flux of charge , or energy or entropy ) with that of the opposite event .",
    "this relation is true * far from equilibrium*. it has been proved rigorously in various contexts ( chaotic systems , markov / langevin dynamics ... ) .    in the multiple variable case ,",

    "a fruitful strategy to gain insight into non - equilibrium physics is to extract as much information as possible from analytical studies and from exact solutions of some special models .",
    "building a simple representation for complex phenomena is a common procedure in physics , leading to the emergence of paradigmatic systems : the harmonic oscillator , the random walker , the ising model .",
    "all these ` beautiful models ' often display wonderful mathematical structures @xcite .    in the field of non - equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is reaching the status of such a paradigm .",
    "the asep consists of particles on a lattice , that hop from a site to its immediate neighbours , and satisfy the _ exclusion condition _",
    "( there is at most one particle per site ) .",
    "therefore , a jump is allowed only if the target site is empty .",
    "physically , the exclusion constraint mimics short - range interactions amongst particles .",
    "besides , in order to drive this lattice gas out of equilibrium , non - vanishing currents must be established in the system .",
    "this can be achieved by various means : by starting from non - uniform initial conditions , by coupling the system to external reservoirs that drive currents through the system ( transport of particles , energy , heat ) or by introducing some intrinsic bias in the dynamics that favours motion in a privileged direction .",
    "thus , each particle is an asymmetric random walker that interacts with the other and drifts steadily along the direction of an external driving force .    from figure",
    "[ fig : asep ] , it can be seen that the asep on a finite lattice , in contact with two reservoirs , is an idealization of the paradigmatic pipe picture of figure  [ fig : courant ] that we have been constantly discussing .        to summarize ,",
    "the asep is a minimal model to study non - equilibrium behaviour .",
    "it is simple enough to allow analytical studies , however it contains the necessary ingredients for the emergence of a non - trivial phenomenology :    * asymmetric : the external driving breaks detailed - balance and creates a stationary current in the system .",
    "the model exhibits a non - equilibrium stationary state . *",
    "exclusion : the hard core - interaction implies that there is at most 1 particle per site .",
    "the asep is a genuine n - body problem . *",
    "process : the dynamics is stochastic and markovian : there is no underlying hamiltonian .",
    "the asep is a markov process , consisting of particles located on a discrete lattice that evolves in continuous time .",
    "we shall consider only the case when the underlying lattice is one dimensional .",
    "the stochastic evolution rules are the following : at time @xmath6 a particle located at a site @xmath188 in the bulk of the system jumps , in the interval between @xmath6 and @xmath162 , with probability @xmath189 to the next neighbouring site @xmath190 if this site is empty ( _ exclusion rule _ ) and with probability @xmath191 to the site @xmath192 if this site is empty .",
    "the scalars @xmath68 and @xmath82 are parameters of the system ; by rescaling time , one often takes @xmath193 and @xmath82 arbitrary .",
    "( another commonly used rescaling is @xmath194 ) . in the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep )",
    "the jumps are totally biased in one direction ( @xmath195 or @xmath196 ) . on the other hand , the _ symmetric _ exclusion process ( sep ) corresponds to the choice @xmath197 .",
    "the physics and the phenomenology of the asep are extremely sensitive to the boundary conditions .",
    "we shall mainly discuss three types of boundary conditions ( see figure  [ fig : bc ] ) :    \\(i ) the periodic system : the exclusion process is defined on a one dimensional lattice with @xmath198 sites ( sites @xmath188 and @xmath199 are identical ) and @xmath4 particles .",
    "note that the dynamics conserves the total number @xmath4 of particles    \\(ii ) the finite one - dimensional lattice of @xmath198 sites with open boundaries . here , the site number @xmath200 ( entrance site ) and site number @xmath198 play a special role .",
    "site 1 interacts with the left reservoir as follows : if site 1 is empty , a particle can enter with rate @xmath201 whereas if it is occupied it can become vacant with rate @xmath202 .",
    "similarly , the interactions with the right reservoir are as follows : if site @xmath198 is empty , a particle can enter the system with rate @xmath203 and if @xmath198 is occupied , the particle can leave the system with rate @xmath204 .",
    "the entrance and exit rates represent the coupling of the finite system with infinite reservoirs which are at different potentials and are located at the boundaries . in the special tasep case , @xmath205 : particles are injected by the left reservoir , they hop in the right direction only and can leave the system from the site number @xmath198 to the right reservoir .",
    "\\(iii ) the asep can also be defined on the infinite one - dimensional lattice . here",
    ", the boundaries are sent to @xmath206 .",
    "boundary conditions are here of a different kind : the infinite system remains always sensitive to the configuration it started from .",
    "therefore , when studying the asep on the infinite lattice one must carefully specify the initial configuration ( or statistical set of configurations ) the dynamics has begun with .",
    "due to its simplicity , the asep has been introduced and used in various contexts .",
    "it was first proposed as a prototype to describe the dynamics of ribosomes along rna @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : ribosome ] ) . in the mathematical literature ,",
    "brownian processes with hard - core interactions were defined by spitzer who coined the name exclusion process .",
    "the asep also describes transport in low - dimensional systems with strong geometrical constraints such as macromolecules transiting through capillary vessels , anisotropic conductors , or quantum dots where electrons hop to vacant locations and repel each other via coulomb interaction .",
    "very popular modern applications of the exclusion process include molecular motors that transport proteins along filaments inside the cells and , of course , asep and its variants are ubiquitous in discrete models of traffic flow @xcite .",
    "more realistic models that are relevant for applications will not described further : we refer the reader to the review paper @xcite that puts emphasis on biophysical applications .",
    "another feature of asep is its relation with growth processes and in particular to the kardar - parisi - zhang equation in one - dimension ( see figure  [ fig : kpz ] ) .",
    "a classic review on this subject is @xcite .",
    "the relation between the exclusion process and kpz has lead recently to superb mathematical developments : we refer the readers to recent reviews @xcite for details and references .",
    "more generally , the asep belongs to the class of driven diffusive systems defined by katz , lebowitz and spohn in 1984 @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we emphasize that the asep is defined through dynamical rules : there is no energy associated with a microscopic configuration .",
    "more generally , the kinetic point of view seems to be a promising and fruitful approach to non - equilibrium systems .         of a continuous interface : @xmath207 where @xmath208 is a gaussian white noise .",
    ", height=226 ]    we emphasize that there are very many variants of the fundamental asep : the dynamical rules can be modified ( discrete - time dynamics , sequential or parallel updates , shuffle updates ) ; one can introduce local defects in the model by modifying the dynamics on some specific bonds ; it is possible to consider different types of particles with different hopping rates ; one can also consider quenched or dynamical disorder in the lattice ; the lattice geometry itself can be changed ( two - lane models , asep defined on a stripe , on a network etc ... ) .",
    "all these alterations drastically modify the outcome of the dynamics and require specific methods to be investigated .",
    "literally hundreds of works have been devoted to the asep and its variants during the last fifteen years . here , we shall focus only on the homogeneous case with the three ideal types of boundary conditions discussed above and present some of the mathematical methods that have been developed for these three ideal cases .",
    "the evolution of the asep is encoded in the markov operator @xmath20 . for a finite - size system ,",
    "the markov operator @xmath20 is a matrix ; for the infinite system @xmath20 is an operator and its precise definition needs more elaborate mathematical tools @xcite .",
    "unless stated otherwise , we shall focus here on the technically simpler case of a finite configuration space of size @xmath198 and the infinite system limit is obtained formally by taking @xmath209 .",
    "an important feature of the asep on a finite lattice is ergodicity : any configuration can evolve to any other one in a finite number of steps .",
    "this property insures that the perron - frobenius theorem holds true ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the markov matrix @xmath20 contains the value 0 as a non - degenerate eigenvalue and that all other eigenvalues @xmath210 have a strictly negative real part .",
    "the physical interpretation of the spectrum of @xmath20 is the following : the right eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the stationary state ( or steady - state ) of the dynamics .",
    "because all non - zero eigenvalues @xmath210 have a strictly negative real part , the corresponding eigenmodes of @xmath20 are relaxation states : the relaxation time is given by @xmath211 and the imaginary part of @xmath210 leads to oscillations .",
    "we emphasize that from the mathematical point of view , the operator @xmath20 encodes all the required data of the dynamics and any ` physical ' questions that one may ask about the system ultimately refers to some property of @xmath20 .",
    "we shall now list some fundamental issues that may arise :    * once the dynamics is properly defined , the basic question is to determine the steady - state @xmath212 of the system _ i.e. , _ the eigenvector of @xmath20 with eigenvalue 0 . given a configuration @xmath8 , the value of the component @xmath213 is the stationary weight ( or measure ) of @xmath8 in the steady - state , _",
    "i.e. , _ it represents the frequency of occurrence of @xmath8 in the stationary state . *",
    "the knowledge of the vector @xmath212 is similar to knowing the gibbs - boltzmann canonical law in equilibrium statistical mechanics . from @xmath214",
    "one can determine steady - state properties and all equal - time steady - state correlations .",
    "some important questions are : what is the mean occupation @xmath215 of a given site @xmath188 ?",
    "what does the most likely density profile , given by the function @xmath216 , look like ?",
    "can one calculate density - density correlation functions between different sites ? what is the probability of occurrence of a density profile that differs significantly from the most likely one ( this probability is called the large deviation of the density profile ) ? * the asep , being a non - equilibrium system , carries a finite , non - zero , steady - state current @xmath217 .",
    "the value of this current is an important physical observable of the model .",
    "the dependence of @xmath217 on the external parameters of the system can allow to define different phases of the system .",
    "* fluctuations in the steady - state : the stationary state is a dynamical state in which the system constantly evolves from one micro - state to another .",
    "this microscopic evolution induces macroscopic fluctuations ( which are the equivalent of the gaussian brownian fluctuations at equilibrium ) .",
    "how can one characterize steady - state fluctuations ?",
    "are they necessarily gaussian ? how are they related to the linear response of the system to small perturbations in the vicinity of the steady - state ?",
    "these issues can be tackled by considering tagged - particle dynamics , anomalous diffusion , time - dependent perturbations of the dynamical rules etc ... * the existence of a current @xmath217 in the stationary state corresponds to the physical transport of some extensive quantity @xmath218 ( mass , charge , energy ) through the system .",
    "the total quantity @xmath219 transported during a ( long ) period of time @xmath6 in the steady - state is a random quantity .",
    "we know that the mean value of @xmath219 is given by @xmath220 but there are fluctuations .",
    "more specifically , in the long time limit , the distribution of the random variable @xmath221 represents exceptional fluctuations of the mean - current ( known as large deviations ) : this is an important observable that quantifies the transport properties of the system . *",
    "the way a system relaxes to its stationary state is also an important characteristic of the system .",
    "the typical relaxation time @xmath0 of the asep scales with the size @xmath198 of the system as @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "the value of @xmath223 is related to the spectral gap of the markov matrix @xmath20 , _ i.e. _ , to the real - part of its largest non - vanishing eigenvalue . for a diffusive system",
    ", one has @xmath224 . for the asep with periodic boundary condition , an exact calculation leads to @xmath225 .",
    "more generally , the transitory state of the model can be probed using correlation functions at different times . *",
    "the matrix @xmath20 is generally a non - symmetric matrix and , therefore , its right eigenvectors differ from its left eigenvectors . for instance , a right eigenvector @xmath226 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath210 is defined as @xmath227 knowing the spectrum of @xmath20 conveys a lot of information about the dynamics .",
    "there are analytical techniques , such as the bethe ansatz , that allow us to diagonalize @xmath20 in some specific cases . because @xmath20 is a real matrix , its eigenvalues ( and eigenvectors ) are either real numbers or complex conjugate pairs . *",
    "solving analytically the master equation would allow us to calculate exactly the evolution of the system .",
    "a challenging goal is to determine the finite - time green function ( or transition probability ) @xmath228 , the probability for the system to be in configuration @xmath8 at time @xmath6 , knowing that the initial configuration at time @xmath229 was @xmath48 .",
    "the knowledge of the transition probability , together with the markov property , allows us in principle to calculate all the correlation functions of the system .",
    "the following sections are devoted to explaining some analytical techniques that have been developed to answer some of these issues for the asep .      before discussing exact techniques to solve the dynamics of the asep",

    "it is natural to look for a continuous description of the model .",
    "finding an accurate hydrodynamic model for interacting particle processes is a difficult and important problem .",
    "here , we present a naive approach that reveals the relation between the asep and burgers equation .",
    "we recall that the binary variable @xmath230 characterizes if site @xmath188 is empty or occupied . the average value @xmath231 satisfies the following equation : @xmath232   + q [ \\langle \\tau_{i+1 } ( 1 - \\tau_i ) \\rangle    -   \\langle \\tau_{i } ( 1 - \\tau_{i-1 } ) \\rangle ] \\nonumber \\\\    & = & p",

    "the procedure is quite simple .",
    "we sketch it below : 0.3 cm @xmath234 define the continuous space variable @xmath235 . and the limit @xmath236    0.3 cm @xmath234 define a smooth local density by @xmath237 .",
    "0.3 cm @xmath234 rescale the rates : @xmath238 and @xmath239    0.3 cm @xmath234 mean - field assumption : write the 2-points averages as products of 1-point averages .    after carrying out this program leads to , after a diffusive rescaling of time @xmath240 to the following partial differential equation",

    "the proof is a major mathematical achievement .",
    "had we kept a finite asymmetry : @xmath247 , the same procedure ( with ballistic time - rescaling ) would have led us to the inviscid limit of burgers equation : @xmath248 this equation is a textbook example of a pdf that generates shocks , even if the initial condition is smooth . a natural question that arises",
    "is whether these shocks an artefact of the hydrodynamic limit or do they genuinely exist at the microscopic level .",
    "the following model , invented by j. l. lebowitz and s. a. janowsky sheds light on this issue .",

    ". it will provide us with a good illustration of mean - field methods .",
    "the simplest version of lebowitz - janowsky model is a tasep on a periodic ring with one defective bound : through that bound ( say the bond between site @xmath198 and site 1 ) the jump rate is given by @xmath249 whereas through all the other bonds , the jump rates are equal to 1 . for @xmath250 ( which is the most interesting case ) , we have a slow bond , i.e. a constriction , that may prevent the flow of particles through and generate a traffic - jam. this is indeed what is going to happen : for any given density @xmath100 , there is a critical value @xmath251 such that for @xmath252 a separation will occur between a dense phase before the slow bond and a sparse phase after that bond .",

    "the density is approximately uniform ( as numerical simulations show , see figure  [ fig : jleb ] ) .",
    "thus , using a mean - field assumption we can write @xmath256 where @xmath257 and @xmath258 are the values of the density plateaux on both sides of the slow bond .",
    "this relation leads to two possible solutions :    @xmath234 either the density is uniform everywhere , i.e. , @xmath259    @xmath234 or we have different densities on the sides that make a shock .",
    "then , necessarily : @xmath260    to find the values of the density plateaux , we calculate the mean - field current right at the defective bond : @xmath261 ( this is a strong approximation that neglects correlations through the slow bond . ) we now have enough equations to obtain @xmath262    to conclude the analysis , we must find the condition for the existence of the shock : when do we have @xmath263 and when @xmath264 ?",

    "<S> then we shall introduce the detailed balance condition and explain how it is related to time reversal ( section  [ subsec : detailedb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow us to give a precise definition of the concept of ` equilibrium ' from a dynamical point of view .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of non - equilibrium processes will begin in section  [ sec : noneq ] . </S>",
    "<S> we shall use as a leitmotiv for non - equilibrium , the picture of rod ( or pipe ) in contact with two reservoirs at different temperatures , or at different electrical ( chemical ) potentials ( see figure  [ fig : courant ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this simple picture will allow us to formulate some of the basic questions that have to be answered in order to understand non - equilibrium physics . </S>",
    "<S> the current theory of non - equilibrium processes requires the use of some mathematical tools , such as large - deviation functions , that are introduced , through various examples ( independent bernoulli variables , random walk ... ) , in section  [ subsec : ldf ] ; in particular , we explain how the thermodynamic free energy is connected to the large deviations of the density profile of a gas enclosed in a vessel . in section  [ subsec : cumulants ] , we show the relations between the large - deviation function and cumulants of a random variable . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ subsec : gdb ] is devoted to the very important concept of generalized detailed balance , a fundamental remnant of the time - reversal invariance of physics , that prevails even in situations far from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> then , in section  [ subsec : ft ] , the fluctuation theorem is derived for markov system that obey generalized detailed balance .    from section  [ sec : asep ] on , these lectures focus on the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) and on some of the techniques developed in the last twenty years to derive exact solutions for this model and its variants . after a brief presentation of the model and of some of its simple properties ( sections  [ subsec : defasep ] to [ subsec : ptes ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we apply the mean - field approximation to derive the hydrodynamic behaviour in section  [ subsec : mf ] ; in particular , this technique is illustrated on the lebowitz - janowsky blockage model , a fascinating problem that has so far eluded an exact solution . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section  [ subsec : steady ] , the celebrated exact calculation of the steady state of the asep with open boundaries , using the matrix representation method , is described .    </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : bethe ] contains a crash - course on the bethe ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the asep on a periodic ring , is the simplest model to learn how to apply this very important method . </S>",
    "<S> we try to explain the various steps that lead to the bethe equations in section  [ subsec : crashcourse ] . </S>",
    "<S> these equations are analysed in the special tasep case in section  [ subsec : batasep ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now ready to calculate large deviation functions for non - equilibrium problems : this is the goal of section  [ sec : ldfnoneq ] . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to derive large deviations of the stationary current for the pipe picture , modelled by the asep . </S>",
    "<S> this is done first for the periodic case ( asep on a ring ) in section  [ subsec : periodic ] , then for the open system in contact with two reservoirs ( section  [ subsec : openasep ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the similarities between the two solutions are emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> exact formulae for cumulants and for the large deviation functions are given . </S>",
    "<S> this section is the most advanced part of the course and represents the synthesis of the concepts and techniques that were developed in earlier sections . </S>",
    "<S> detailed calculations are not given and can be found in recent research papers .    </S>",
    "<S> the last section is devoted to concluding remarks and is followed by the bibliography . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that these lecture notes are not intended to be a review paper . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the bibliography is rather succinct and is restricted to some of the books , review papers or articles that were used while preparing this course . </S>",
    "<S> more precise references can be found easily from these sources . </S>",
    "<S> our major influences in preparing these lectures come from the review of b. derrida @xcite and from the book of p. l. krapivsky , s. redner and e. ben - naim @xcite . </S>"
