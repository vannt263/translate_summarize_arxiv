    "there exist two distinct types of supernova explosions : one is type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) , which are the core collapse - induced explosions of short - lived massive stars ( @xmath4 ) and produce more o and mg relative to fe ( i.e. , [ o / fe ] @xmath5 ) , and the other is type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , which are the thermonuclear explosions of accreting white dwarfs ( wds ) in close binaries and produce mostly fe and little o. the exact companion stars of the wds have not been identified but must be relatively long - lived low mass stars .",
    "the role of these two types of supernovae in the chemical evolution of galaxies can be seen in the abundance ratios of stars with different metallicities , most notably in the [ o / fe]-[fe / h ] relation .",
    "metal poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 have [ o / fe ] @xmath6 on the average ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while disk stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath7 show a decrease in [ o / fe ] with increasing metallicity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . such an evolutionary change in [ o / fe ] against [ fe / h ]",
    "has been explained with the early heavy element production by sne ii and the delayed enrichment of fe by sne ia ( @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , chemical evolution models can constrain the nature of still uncertain progenitor systems of sne ia ; for example , yoshii , tsujimoto , & nomoto ( 1996 ) estimated the lifetime of sn ia progenitors as long as @xmath8 gyr .",
    "sne ia have been discovered up to @xmath9 by supernova cosmology project ( @xcite ) and high - z supernova search team ( @xcite ) .",
    "they have given the sn ia rate at @xmath10 ( @xcite ) but will provide the sn ia rate history over @xmath11 . with the next generation space telescope , both sne ia and ii will be observed through @xmath12 . in theoretical approach , the cosmic sn ia rate as a function of redshift has been constructed for a cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the comparison between the model prediction and observations can constrain the lifetime of the progenitor systems of sne ia .",
    "the progenitors of the majority of sne ia are most likely the chandrasekhar ( ch ) mass wds ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) , although the sub - ch mass models might correspond to some peculiar sub - luminous sne ia .",
    "the early time spectra of the majority of sne ia are in excellent agreement with the synthetic spectra of the ch mass models , while the spectra of the sub - ch mass models are too blue to be compatible with observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the evolution of accreting wds toward the ch mass ,",
    "two scenarios have been proposed : one is a double degenerate ( dd ) scenario , i.e. , merging of double c+o wds with a combined mass surpassing the ch mass limit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the other is a single degenerate ( sd ) scenario , i.e. , accretion of hydrogen - rich matter via mass transfer from a binary companion ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the issue of dd vs. sd is still debated ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) , although theoretical modeling has indicated that the merging of wds does not make typical sne ia ( @xcite , 1998 ) .    for the sd scenario ,",
    "a new evolutionary model has been proposed by hachisu , kato , & nomoto ( 1996 , 1998 ; hereafter hkn96 and hkn98 , respectively ) and hachisu & kato ( 1998 ; hereafter hk98 ) .",
    "hkn96 have shown that if the accretion rate exceeds a certain limit , the wd blows a strong wind and burns hydrogen steadily to increase the wd mass ( see section 2 ) . hkn98",
    "have further invoked the effect of stripping - off of the envelope from the companion by the strong wind , and shown that the wd can reach the ch mass for much wider binary parameter space than found by hkn96 , li & van den heuvel ( 1997 ) , and yungelson & livio ( 1998 ) ; the allowed parameter space may be large enough to account for the sn ia frequency .",
    "moreover , hk98 have found an important metallicity effect ; if the iron abundance of the accreted matter is as low as [ fe / h ] @xmath0 , the wd wind is too weak to increase the wd mass through the ch mass .    in the present _ letter _",
    ", we apply the above two scenarios to the chemical evolution models , and compare the cases with and without the metallicity effect on sne ia .",
    "we have found that the model for sd scenario with the metallicity effect is significantly better to reproduce the evolutionary change in [ o / fe ] and other properties ( section 3 ) . using the metallicity dependent sn ia rate",
    ", we make a prediction for the cosmic supernova rate history ( section 4 ) . in section 5",
    "we discuss other implications on the galactic halo objects , damped ly@xmath3 ( dla ) systems and cosmology .",
    "our sd scenario has two progenitor systems : one is a red - giant ( rg ) companion with the initial mass of @xmath13 and the orbital period of tens to hundreds days ( hkn96 ; hkn98 ) . the other is a near main - sequence ( ms ) companion with the initial mass of @xmath14 and the period of several tenths of a day to several days ( @xcite ; hkn98 ) . in these sd scenarios ,",
    "optically thick winds from the mass accreting wd play an essential role in stabilizing the mass transfer and escaping from forming a common envelope .",
    "the optically thick winds are driven by a strong peak of opal opacity at @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the peak is due to iron lines , the optically thick winds depend strongly on the metallicity ( hk98 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the metallicity dependence of the optically thick winds .",
    "the strong winds are possible only for the region above the dashed line .",
    "the term `` weak '' implies that the wind velocity at the photosphere does not exceed the escape velocity there , that is , it can not blow the accreted matter off the wd . for the metallicity as small as @xmath16 ,",
    "the opacity peak at @xmath17 is very weak , being smaller than the peak of helium lines at @xmath18 .",
    "then , the wind is driven by the helium line peak rather than the iron line peak , which we call `` he wind '' instead of `` fe wind '' . since only the initial wd mass of @xmath19 can produce an sn ia ( @xcite ) , sn ia events occur only for the progenitors with [ fe / h ] @xmath20 , which is adopted in our chemical evolution model .",
    "figure 2 shows the sn ia regions in the diagram of the initial orbital period vs. the initial mass of the companion star for the initial wd mass of @xmath21 ( see hk98 for other @xmath22 ) . in these regions ,",
    "the accretion from the companion star increases the wd mass successfully through the occurrence of sn ia .",
    "the dashed line shows the case of solar abundance ( @xmath23 ) , while the solid line shows the much lower metallicity case of @xmath24 .",
    "the size of these regions clearly demonstrate the metallicity effect , i.e. , sn ia regions are much smaller for smaller metallicity .",
    "the initial mass ranges of the companion stars for @xmath24 are @xmath25 for the wd+rg system and @xmath26 for the wd+ms system .",
    "we use the chemical evolution model which allows the material infall from outside the disk region . for the infall rate , we adopt a formula which is proportional to @xmath27 $ ] with a infall timescale of @xmath28 gyr ( yoshii et al .",
    "the galactic age is assumed to be 15 gyr .",
    "the sfr is assumed to be proportional to the gas fraction with a constant rate coefficient of @xmath29 gyr@xmath30 .",
    "for the initial mass function ( imf ) , we assume a power - law mass spectrum with a salpeter slope of @xmath31 in the range of @xmath32 ( @xcite ) . we take the nucleosynthesis yields of sne ia and ii from tsujimoto et al .",

    "1997b , c for details ) and the metallicity dependent main - sequence lifetime from kodama ( 1997 ) .    for the sd scenario ,",
    "the lifetime of sne ia is determined from the main - sequence lifetime of the companion star .",
    "we adopt the initial mass ranges of the binary companion stars obtained in section 2 .",
    "the distribution function of the initial mass of the companions is taken from the mass ratio distribution in binaries ( @xcite ) , which is approximated by a power - law mass spectrum with a slope @xmath33 .",
    "the fraction of primary stars of @xmath34 which eventually produce sne ia is set to be @xmath35 for both the wd+ms and the wd+rg systems , adjusted to reproduce the chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood . for the dd scenario",
    "we adopt the distribution function of the lifetime of sne ia by tutukov & yungelson ( 1994 ) , majority of which is @xmath36 gyr .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolutionary change in [ o / fe ] for three sn ia models .",
    "the dotted line is for the dd scenario .",
    "the other lines are for our sd scenario with ( solid line ) and without ( dashed line ) the metallicity effect on sne ia .",
    "the results are as follows .",
    "* in the dd scenario the lifetime of the majority of sne ia is shorter than @xmath37 gyr .",
    "then the decrease in [ o / fe ] starts at [ fe / h ] @xmath38 , which is too early compared with the observed decrease in [ o / fe ] starting at [ fe / h ] @xmath39 .",
    "* for the sd scenario with no metallicity effect , the companion star with @xmath40 evolves off the main - sequence to give rise to sne ia at the age of @xmath41 gyr .",
    "the resultant decrease in [ o / fe ] starts too early to be compatible with the observations .",
    "* for the metallicity dependent sd scenario , sne ia occur at [ fe / h ] @xmath7 , which naturally reproduce the observed break in [ o / fe ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath39 .",
    "we also perform the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to estimate how well the predicted abundance patterns agree with the observed one ( @xcite ) , and tabulate the resultant probabilities in table 1 .",
    "the ks test is applied to the abundance distribution function in the range of @xmath42 } \\leq 0.45 $ ] and to the evolutionary behavior of [ o / fe ] in the range of @xmath43 } \\leq 0.02 $ ] .",
    "the predicted abundance distribution functions are identical with the observational data with more than @xmath44 probability for both the dd and sd scenarios . for our sn ia model with the metallicity effect , the calculated [ o / fe ] against [ fe / h ] fits well to the observations with @xmath45 probability .",
    "but when we neglect the metallicity effect , the probability decreases to @xmath46 . for the dd scenario",
    "the calculated [ o / fe ] is rejected with @xmath47 probability .",
    "we apply our sn ia progenitor scenario to predict the cosmic supernova rate history and the cosmic chemical evolution corresponding to the observed cosmic sfr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric evolution is calculated with the spectral synthesis population database taken from kodama ( 1997 ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath48 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and the redshift at the formation epoch of galaxies @xmath51 .",
    "we use the initial comoving density of gas @xmath52 ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the cosmic supernova rate per @xmath53 per century ( snu ) .",
    "the long dashed line is for sne ii and the other lines for sne ia with ( solid line ) and without ( dashed line ) the metallicity effect .",
    "if we do not include the metallicity effect , the sn ia rate is almost flat from the present to higher redshift , and decreases toward the formation epoch of galaxies . if we include the metallicity effect , the sn ia rate drops at @xmath54 , where the iron abundance of the gas in the universe is too low ( i.e. , [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) for the progenitors of sne ia to make explosions .",
    "the redshift where the sn ia rate drops is determined by the speed of the chemical enrichment , which depends on the effect of dust extinction on the cosmic sfr ( @xcite ) , cosmology , galaxy formation epoch and the initial gas density . taking into account these uncertainties , the break in the sn ia rate occurs at @xmath55 .",
    "we should note that galaxies being responsible for the global sfr have different heavy - element enrichment timescale , some of which are starburst galaxies and ellipticals achieving [ fe / h ] @xmath39 in much shorter timescale than in figure 4 . in such galaxies sne ia can occur even at @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce a metallicity dependence of the sn ia rate in the galactic and cosmic chemical evolution models . in our scenario involving a strong wind from wds , little sne",
    "ia occur at [ fe / h ] @xmath0 .",
    "our model successfully reproduces the observed chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we make the following predictions which can test this metallicity effect .",
    "1 ) sne ia are not found in the low - iron abundance environments such as dwarf galaxies and the outskirts of spirals .",
    "2 ) the cosmic sn ia rate drops at @xmath1 due to the low - iron abundance , which can be observed with the next generation space telescope . at @xmath2",
    ", sne ia can be found only in the environments where the timescale of metal enrichment is sufficiently short as in starburst galaxies and ellipticals .",
    "\\1 ) it imposes a limit on the metallicity range of the sn ia progenitors .",
    "this would imply that `` evolution effects '' are relatively small for the use of high redshift sne ia to determine the cosmological parameters .",
    "\\2 ) microlensing experiments ( @xcite ) suggest the wd - dominated galactic halo .",
    "the existence of so many wds results in too much iron enrichment from sne ia ( @xcite )",
    ". however , wds of halo populations are poor producers of sne ia , so that the iron abundance of the halo may not put the strong constraint on the contribution of wds .",
    "note , however , that there exist several other arguments against the wd - dominated halo ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "\\3 ) the galactic halo is a low - metallicity system with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 and have an abundance pattern of genuine sn ii origin , i.e. , the overabundances of @xmath3-elements relative to fe as [ @xmath3/fe ] @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however there exist age differences of several gyrs among the clusters ( @xcite ) as well as field stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the shortest lifetime of sne ia is @xmath41 gyr for the ms+wd close binary systems , sn ia contamination would be seen in [ @xmath3/fe ] if there were no metallicity effect on sne ia .",
    "this apparent discrepancy between the age difference and the high [ @xmath3/fe ] can be resolved by the low - metallicity inhibition of sne ia .",
    "\\4 ) similar interpretation holds also for dla systems .",
    "the dla systems observed at @xmath56 have [ fe / h]@xmath57 to @xmath58 and indicate [ @xmath3/fe ] @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested there may exist the age - metallicity relation in dla systems , which implies that dla systems grown through a common chemical history spanning over several gyrs .",
    "if so , the sn ii - like abundance pattern in dla systems needs the introduction of the metallicity dependent sn ia rate to avoid the contamination of sn ia products .",
