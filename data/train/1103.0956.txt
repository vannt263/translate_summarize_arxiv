    "although the high energy physics community is unanimous in considering the standard model ( sm ) to be incomplete for many and well known reasons , such as the higgs mass instability under quantum corrections or the unexplained hierarchy observed in the masses of the fermionic sector ; it is impossible to deny its enormous ( and , to some extent , unexpected ) experimental success . indeed , after years of scrutiny and new physics search , first at the lep and the tevatron and now at the lhc , the sm has not been still seriously challenged by collider experiments . the only exception today",
    "may be the @xmath0 deviation recently reported by cdf in the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath1)@xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the process under question involves the top quark makes it even more interesting since , due to its mass which is near the electroweak scale , it has been suspected for a long time that the top - quark plays a special rle in nature .    a natural candidate to explain a deviation in @xmath1 is an axigluon",
    "( other alternatives beyond the sm have been considered in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , this is an expected axigluon signal @xcite .",
    "it is true that it has been argued that the present signal can not be explained by an axigluon due to other experimental constraints over it @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , bai , hewett , kaplan and rizzo have argued that a heavy and broad axigluon can be a viable explanation of the @xmath1 while remaining invisible in the dijet spectrum @xcite .    in their paper , they parameterize the axigluon interaction as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the usual qcd coupling constant a @xmath4 measures the deviation of the axigluon coupling constant from qcd . in order to evade experimental constraint",
    "it proves useful to consider that @xmath4 may take different values for light quarks ( @xmath5 ) and for the top quark ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the analysis presented in @xcite shows that in order to have a broad axigluon it must occur that @xmath7 . additionally , in order to escape detection in contact interaction searches it must happen that @xmath8 ( this kind of non - universality has been also reported in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , @xmath9 must be negative in order to reproduce correctly the sign of @xmath1 .",
    "the construction of a model that can incorporate all these conditions , specially the different coupling constants for different generations , has proven to be difficult . as a solution",
    ", the authors of @xcite propose a two - site model but they have to include exotic vector - like quarks in order to satisfy the @xmath8 constrain .    in this paper",
    ", we address the construction of a viable axigluon model not by adding new fermions but by extending the gauge sector of the model . in section [ sec : effmodel ] we show that an effective model , based on @xmath10 but with four octet fields transforming as gauge bosons , has enough structure to accommodate all the desire features of the axigluon . in section [ sec:4site ] , we show that the essential characteristics of the effective model can be obtained from a four - site model with delocalized fermions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we start by recalling an effective extended chiral model we have previously proposed@xcite . in this model , we consider an usual @xmath11 with two pairs of vectors fields : @xmath12 and @xmath13 transforming as gauge fields of @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 transforming as gauge fields of @xmath17 .",
    "the gauge sector of the model ( including a non - linear sigma model sector which is introduced to produce the breaking of @xmath11 to @xmath18 ) is described by the following lagrangian :    @xmath19    where    @xmath20\\\\ g_{r\\mu\\nu } & = & \\partial_{\\mu}r_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu}r_{\\mu}-ig_{r}\\left[r_{\\mu},\\ : r_{\\nu}\\right]\\\\ \\rho_{l\\mu\\nu } & = & \\partial_{\\mu}l_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu}l_{\\mu}-ig'_{l}\\left[l_{\\mu},\\ :    l_{\\nu}\\right]\\\\   \\rho_{r\\mu\\nu } & = & \\partial_{\\mu}r_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu}r_{\\mu}-ig'_{r}\\left[r_{\\mu},\\ :    r_{\\nu}\\right]\\\\   d_{\\mu}u & = & \\partial_{\\mu}u - ig_{l}l_{\\mu}u+ig_{r}ur_{\\mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the unitary gauge a non - diagonal mass matrix is explicitly generated .",
    "although the resulting mass matrix can be exactly diagonalized , in order to obtain easily manipulable expressions we will assume that @xmath21 and we will write our results in the first order in @xmath22 . the eigenvalues , that is , the masses of the physical states are :    @xmath23    thus , the physical spectrum is composed of a ( exactly ) massless gluon , an axigluon and two degenerate ( at this level of approximation ) heavy gluon and axigluon .",
    "the normalized mass eigenvectors can be written as :    @xmath24    because we have now two fields that transform as gauge fields for each group ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath25 and @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath26 ) any combination of the form @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a new arbitrary parameter . in principle",
    ", it can take different values in the right and left sectors but , for simplicity we will assume it is the same in both cases . with this structure it is possible to construct generalized covariant derivatives .",
    "this means that the lagrangian describing the gauge interaction of quarks can be written as :    @xmath30    using lagrangian ( [ eq : mylagferm ] ) and the definition of the physical fields , we can obtain the terms of the lagrangian that couple the gluon and the axigluon to quarks    @xmath31    where :    @xmath32    and @xmath33 interestingly , the mechanism described just above is related with fermion delocalization in deconstruction theory @xcite .",
    "now we have an axigluon with a modified coupling to quarks .",
    "nothing in the model prevents that the value of @xmath4 varies from one generation to another .",
    "this implies that in this framework we can easily satisfy the necessary conditions ( in particular , @xmath8 constrain ) for making the axigluon compatible with existing data and , at the same time , explain the @xmath1 data from cdf .",
    "the key features of the model described in this section are the presence of two pairs of vector bosons which transform like gauge fields and delocalized fermions .",
    "these properties can be naturally implemented in a four - site model .",
    "the construction of such a model is the subject of next section .",
    "our simple four site model is based on the gauge group @xmath34 and three link fields ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) as shown in figure [ fig : group ] .",
    "we assume that the scalar fields develop vacuum expectation values ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) breaking down the gauge symmetry to @xmath18 which we identify with the usual color group .",
    "the lagrangian for the bosonic sector can be written as :    @xmath40    where    @xmath41\\\\ d^{\\mu}\\sigma_1 & = & \\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma_1 -iga_{1\\mu}\\sigma_1 + ig\\sigma_1 a_{2\\mu } \\\\",
    "d^{\\mu}u & = & \\partial_{\\mu}u -iga_{2\\mu}u + igua_{3\\mu } \\\\",
    "d^{\\mu}\\sigma_2 & = & \\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma_2 -iga_{3\\mu}\\sigma_2 + ig\\sigma_2 a_{4\\mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that in order to simplify our equations we have assume that all groups share the same coupling constant @xmath42 .    as usual , in the unitary gauge ( @xmath43 ) a non - diagonal mass matrix for the gauges bosons explicitly appears .",
    "this mass matrix can be exactly diagonalized , nevertheless , in benefice of simplicity , we work in the limit where @xmath44 . in this limit , the physical spectrum is composed of a ( exactly ) massless gluon @xmath45 , a light ( in the sense that its mass is proportional to @xmath46 ) axigluon @xmath47 and two degenerate heavy states ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) with masses proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "the original gauge fields can be written in terms of the physical fields as follows :    @xmath51    now we turn our attention to quarks .",
    "a crucial feature of our effective model described in the previous section was the fact that the fermions coupled to a certain linear combination of gauge bosons . in the language of deconstruction theory , it correspond to `` fermion delocalization '' .",
    "the main idea of fermion delocalization @xcite is that the low energy properties of the fermions ( for example the color interaction of quarks ) originate from the contribution of many sites of the underlying gauge group . in other words , the current couples to a linear combination of gauge fields @xmath52 with the constrain @xmath53 in order to preserve gauge invariance under the whole group .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : group ] , we decide to couple left handed quarks to @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( with weights @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively ) and right handed quarks to @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( with weights @xmath57 and @xmath56 respectively ) . in this way , the interaction lagrangian for quarks can be written as :    @xmath60+\\nonumber\\\\ & &   +   gj_{r\\mu}^a\\left[xa^{a\\mu}_4+(1-x)a^{a\\mu}_2\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the quark left - handed and right - handed currents , respectively .",
    "notice that we have chosen , for simplicity , the same delocalization parameter @xmath56 for right handed and left handed quarks . in terms of the physical fields the interaction lagrangian can be written as :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the usual strong interaction coupling constant .",
    "our delocalization pattern has provoked the appearance of a axigluon interaction which depends on the delocalization parameter @xmath56 .",
    "as in our effective model , nothing prevents that different quark generations can be differently delocalized . in this way , we can select appropriated values of @xmath56 for the top quark and for the light quarks in order to consistently explain the @xmath1 measurements .",
    "in summary , we have shown that an extended chiral color model with extra color octet spin-1 fields has enough structure to describe an axigluon with appropriate coupling to quarks in such a way that it can be consistent with dijet and contact interactions searches and , at the same time , explain the @xmath1 anomaly reported by cdf .",
    "the fact that this effective model can be re - obtained from a four - site model , as we have shown , is interesting from the theoretical point of view since , in principle , it may be related , via dimensional deconstruction , to five dimensional models .",
