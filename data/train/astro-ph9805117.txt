    "it may be possible to measure cosmological parameters with great accuracy using upcoming cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments ( jungman 1996 ; bond 1997 ; zaldarriaga 1997 ) , galaxy surveys ( tegmark 1997 ; goldberg & strauss 1998 ; hu 1998 ) and supernova ia ( sn ia ) searches ( goobar & perlmutter 1995 ; perlmutter 1998 ; garnavich 1998 ) .",
    "however , no single type of measurement alone can constrain all parameters , as it will inevitably suffer from so - called _ degeneracies _ in which particular combinations of changes in parameters leave the result essentially unaffected ( bond 1994 , 1997 ; zaldarriaga 1997 ; metcalf & silk 1998 ; huey 1998 ) . fortunately , different types of cosmological measurements are often highly complementary , breaking each other s degeneracies and combining to give much more accurate measurements than any one could give alone .",
    "for example , cmb measurements are highly complementary to both galaxy surveys ( tegmark 1997 ; hu 1998 ; gawiser & silk 1998 ; webster 1998 ; eisenstein 1998 ) and sn ia ( zaldarriaga 1997 ; tegmark 1997 ; white 1997 ) .",

    "most of the cosmological tests that we discuss are well - known .",
    "our focus is on their degeneracy structure , , on which ones are complementary and which ones act as independent cross - checks of one another .",
    "we address this by computing the _ fisher information matrix _",
    "@xmath5 for each of the tests .",
    "this has the advantage of explicitly showing how the accuracy and degeneracy depends on the survey details .",
    "it also allows a unified treatment of all tests , since if independent experiments are analyzed jointly , their fisher information matrices simply add .",

    "the cosmological tests based on luminosity , angular size , age and clustering ( see weinberg 1972 , hereafter w72 ; peebles 1993 ) , can all be described as noisy measurements of some quantities @xmath17 at redshifts @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "we model them as x_n = ad(z ; , ) + b + _ n , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the function @xmath22 incorporates the effects of cosmology and @xmath23 is a random term with zero mean ( @xmath24 ) including all sources of measurement error .    for luminosity tests like sn ia , @xmath17 is the observed magnitude of the @xmath25 object and @xmath22 is the luminosity distance ( w72 ) : = ( 1+z)s(),(z ; , ) = _ 0^zdze(z ) , e(z)^1/2 , where @xmath26 . we recognize @xmath27 as the relative expansion rate at an earlier time and @xmath28 as ( the magnitude of ) the current radius of curvature of the universe . from the definition of magnitudes , @xmath29 .",

    "ia data shrinks the error region to the overlap of the two corresponding ellipses : for instance , a joint analysis of the optimistic sn ia case with polarized planck data gives the tiny black ellipse in the center .",
    "@xmath63 as @xmath64 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath5 from each redshift can thus be split into two factors , one reflecting the quality of the data set ( @xmath65/\\dm^2 $ ] ) and the other incorporating the effects of cosmology ( the weight functions @xmath55 ) . the functions @xmath55 are plotted in figure 1 for a variety of cosmological models .    if all the observed supernovae were at the same redshift @xmath66 , then the resulting @xmath67 fisher matrix @xmath68 would have rank 1 , , be singular .",
    "the vanishing eigenvalue would correspond to the eigenvector @xmath69 .",
    "physically , this is because there is more than one way of fitting a single measured quantity @xmath70 by varying two parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the corresponding ellipse in figure 2 would be infinitely long , with slope @xmath71 , the ratio of the magnitudes of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 curves in figure 1 at that redshift .",
    "the sn ia ellipses plotted in figure 2 correspond to a range of redshifts , with @xmath16 being a gaussian of mean @xmath72 and standard deviation @xmath73 given by table  1 .",
    "this breaks the degeneracy only marginally , leaving the sn ellipses quite skinny , since the ratios @xmath74 in figure 1 are seen to vary only weakly with @xmath66 .      for a sample of objects volume limited out to redshift @xmath75 ,",

    "how do these tests compare with regard to accuracy and degeneracy ?",
    "their degeneracy structure is illustrated in figure 3 , which shows contour plots of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 at three redshifts .",
    "using objects at a single redshift @xmath66 , a test is unable to distinguish between models lying along the same contour curve .",
    "the luminosity and size tests have identical degeneracy structure because both probe @xmath84 ; their degeneracy curves are seen to rotate anti - clockwise from a slope of @xmath85 ( explained below in  [ q0sec ] ) at @xmath86 to negative at @xmath87 .",
    "the count contours rotate in the same sense as @xmath66 increases .",
    "the isochrones rotate similarly but have a richer structure at @xmath86 because the age of the universe probes @xmath88 at all redshifts .",
    "they become vertical at high redshift where the age is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the growth factor degeneracy curves are seen to have a slope steeper than @xmath89 in most of our parameter space .",
    "this is because increasing the hyperbolic curvature @xmath90 makes fluctuation growth freeze out earlier , increasing @xmath91 , and increasing @xmath1 at fixed curvature typically has the same effect . the evolution of cluster abundance places powerful constraints on @xmath91 ( bahcall & fan 1998 ) .",
    "although this test gives highly non - gaussian errors @xmath23 ( the constraints are mainly one - sided ) , its degeneracy structure is still given by fig .",
    "3 .    the list of geometry tests that we have discussed is far from complete . for instance",
    ", nonlinear effects in weak lensing ( jain & seljak 1997 ) and strong lensing ( falco 1998 ; bartelmann 1998 ) are promising probes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . with cmb fixing other parameters , baryonic features detected in future galaxy redshift surveys would give fairly vertical degeneracy curves , potentially measuring @xmath92 to percent levels ( eisenstein 1998 ) .",
    "for all tests modeled above , the _ size _ of the error ellipses scales as @xmath93 , whereas the _ shape _ ( slope and eccentricity ) is given by the degeneracy structure .",
    "the cmb ellipses in figure 2 have been computed as in eisenstein ( 1998 ) , marginalizing over 10 additional parameters .",
    "this cmb information on @xmath0 and @xmath1 comes mainly from the angular location of acoustic features in the power spectrum , which depends principally on the curvature term @xmath94 , , on the combination @xmath95 .",
    "it is well known that if data is available only for @xmath96 , then to first order , the luminosity , angle and count tests probe only the parameter combination @xmath97 . in this limit",
