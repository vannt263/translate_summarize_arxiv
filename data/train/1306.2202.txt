    "cluster state quantum computation is a quantum computing paradigm that can be implemented by applying single - qubit measurements only to a ` cluster state ' @xcite .",
    "the cluster state is a highly entangled state in which qubits initially in the state @xmath0 are entangled via controlled - phase gates .",
    "measurements of the qubits along axes in the _ x - y _ plane implement the desired algorithm . a cluster state with qubits arranged as a two - dimensional array with nearest neighbor entanglement suffices for universal quantum computation .    a possible experimental venue for cluster states is photonics .",
    "nielsen noted @xcite that by using non - deterministic elements of linear optics quantum computation for photonic cluster construction cluster state quantum computation may be more efficient than optical circuit - based quantum computation .",
    "browne and rudolph @xcite refined this idea replacing nielsen s construction method with simpler , also probabilistic , ` fusion ' operations . a number of additional methods for constructing clusters have been suggested @xcite and small photonic cluster states have been experimentally constructed and reported on @xcite .",
    "photonic cluster state quantum computing , as true for all quantum computing schemes , is subject to errors .",
    "thus , fault tolerant schemes , allowing for successful computation despite errors in the basic components of the computer , must be devised .",
    "one such scheme was proposed by dawson , et .",
    "this scheme utilizes certain error correction techniques borrowed from circuit - based quantum computation along with some novel ideas on syndrome measurement .",
    "the cluster states themselves are constructed using fusion operations .",
    "browne and rudolph @xcite utilized two types of fusion operations to build arbitrary cluster state .",
    "type 1 fusion operations were originally introduced to fuse together cluster chains ( clusters in which the qubits are arranged in a 1-dimensional array ) and type 2 fused chains into an ` l'-shape .",
    "later it was shown that type 1 fusion alone allows for the construction of two - dimensional clusters @xcite and thus we explore only this type of fusion operation .",
    "fusion is implemented using a polarizing beam - splitter ( pbs ) , a waveplate , and a photon detector , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "two photons , an edge photon of a cluster chain length @xmath1 and an edge photon of a chain of length @xmath2 enter the pbs at adjacent sides .",
    "each photon will , with probability .5 reflect , or , with probability .5 , transmit .",
    "thus , with a probability of .5 , one and only one photon will emerge from the pbs towards the photon detector . that photon will be rotated by @xmath3 and detected fusing the two chains into a single chain of length @xmath4 .",
    "however , with probability .5 zero or two photons will be detected . in this case",
    "the two photons are lost , fusion has failed and the input cluster chain lengths are reduced to @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    to maximize the probability of successful fusion between two information carrying photons dawson , et .",
    "@xcite introduced ` microclusters . '",
    "each microcluster is composed of an information carrying root node from which sprout several leaf nodes .",
    "microclusters are fused together without risk of losing the information stored in the root nodes by fusing pairs of leaf nodes .",
    "the joining of two micrclusters via a fusion operation are depicted in the figure [ micro ] .",
    "left : microcluster construction via fusion operations .",
    "two epr pairs are fused together to form a two - leaf microcluster ( leaf nodes light , root nodes dark ) .",
    "the root node is then fused with additional epr pairs to grow more leaves .",
    "right : two microclusters are fused via their leaf nodes . if fusion fails the leaf nodes are lost but fusion can be attempted with remaining leaves . upon success a @xmath7-axis measurement of the connecting leaf node removes it while joining the two root nodes . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]   left : microcluster construction via fusion operations .",
    "two epr pairs are fused together to form a two - leaf microcluster ( leaf nodes light , root nodes dark ) .",
    "the root node is then fused with additional epr pairs to grow more leaves .",
    "right : two microclusters are fused via their leaf nodes . if fusion fails the leaf nodes are lost but fusion can be attempted with remaining leaves . upon success a @xmath7-axis measurement of the connecting leaf node",
    "removes it while joining the two root nodes .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    to construct a microcluster we start with an unlimited number of polarization entagled pairs of photons , also called einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs , assumed to be perfectly generated via a process such as spontaneous parametric downconversion .",
    "two such pairs are fused together generating a three photon cluster .",
    "the middle one of the three photons , the one that survived the fusion operation , is the root node .",
    "the root node is then fused with a photon from another epr pair producing a microcluster with three leaves .",
    "additional successful fusion operations will add more leaves onto the root node as shown in fig .",
    "[ micro ] . of course",
    ", if any one of the fusion operations is unsuccessful the entire microcluster is destroyed .",
    "nevertheless , since an arbitrarily large number of attempts can be done in parallel , a @xmath8-leaf microcluster can , with probability arbitrarily close to one , be constructed in time of order @xmath9 using of order @xmath10 epr pairs .",
    "as explained above , success of a fusion operation is signified by one photon being detected .",
    "however , this does not mean that the fusion operation is done perfectly . in reality",
    "the mode - matching and hardware are not perfect .",
    "thus , the success signal from a fusion operation , while signalling success , does not imply that the resulting cluster is without error . in this paper",
    "we explore the effect of errors in the fusion operation on microcluster construction .",
    "we will look at two different error models : ( 1 ) a non - equiprobable pauli error model in which the surviving photon of a successful fusion operation undergoes a @xmath11-rotation with probability @xmath12 , a @xmath13-rotation with probability @xmath14 , a @xmath15-rotation with probability @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a pauli spin operator .",
    "( 2 ) an error in which a successful fusion operation is signalled though there is a probability that an incorrect projection was implemented by the pbs - waveplate combination .",
    "the pbs in an ideal successful fusion operation projects the incoming photons into states with the same polarization and thus one photon will exit each of the two output paths . however , an imperfect pbs may not project the photons into states with the same polarization but will nevertheless send the two photons out on different paths .",
    "in this way a successful fusion operation will be signalled despite the incorrect projection .",
    "furthermore , the photons would actually be distinguishable based on polarization and thus the state of the unmeasured photons will depend on which of the two photons entering the fusion operation is actually measured .",
    "we paramaterize this error by @xmath18 and the imperfect projection operator is then given as : @xmath19 the effects of both of these errors will be quantified via the fidelity of the constructed microclusters .",
    "we then fuse together imperfect microclusters and determine the accuracy of constructing the fused microclusters also via a fidelity .",
    "we note that other aspects of realistic photonic cluster state construction including the need to store cluster states ( though imperfectly ) during construction and effects of dephasing have been explored elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our first step is the construction of the microcluster in each of the error environments .",
    "we assume an inexhaustible supply of perfect epr pairs and the construction follows fig .",
    "1 . in the non - equiprobable error environment",
    "we notice that @xmath11 and @xmath13 errors are symmetric .",
    "thus , we set @xmath20 . the fidelity of the constructed microclusters in this environment is shown in table  [ tab : microppzfide ] as a function of the number of microcluster leaves .",
    ".fidelity of microclusters constructed in the non - equiprobable error environment as a function of the number of leaves , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see from the fidelity results that for @xmath22 the factor most effecting the fidelity is which fusion operation is successful .",
    "the initial number of leaves on the microcluster is unimportant .",
    "as @xmath23 gets smaller the number of leaves plays a more prominent role in the fidelity .",
    "the more leaves initially on the cluster the lower the fidelity .",
    "fidelity of two root qubit clusters as a function of @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "plots are shown for when the first fusion attempt is successful ( black ) , the second ( gray ) , the third ( light gray ) and the fourth ( lowest ) .",
    "the number of initial leaves on the microcluster is 2 ( black , dotted ) , 3 ( chain ) , 4 ( dashed ) , and 5 ( solid ) . ,",
    "in this work we have explored the construction and fusion of microclusters , basic building blocks for fault tolerant cluster state quantum computation , in two different noisy environments .",
    "the first assumes that after successful fusion , the unmeasured qubit is subject to a nonequiprobable pauli error .",
    "the second assumes an imperfect polarizing beam splitter . in both cases adding more leaves to the microcluster lowers the mircocluster fidelity .",
    "the reason to use microclusters is to ensure fusion probability approaching one by fusing leaf nodes rather than information bearing root nodes .",
    "thus , we fuse together two microclusters and determine the resulting fidelity of the two root nodes .",
    "this fidelity is also a function of the number of leaves on the intial microclusters and which fusion operation between leaves is successful .",
    "these simulation are important for purposes of fault tolerant cluster state quantum computation .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge useful conversations with s. pappas and support from the mitre innovation program .",
