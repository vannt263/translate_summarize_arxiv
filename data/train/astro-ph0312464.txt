    "a core collapse supernova produces no electromagnetic radiation until its envelope is completely consumed by the explosion fireball .",
    "this phase ends , however , with a brilliant flash of x - ray or extreme ultraviolet photons heralding the arrival of the fireball shock at the stellar surface .",
    "the `` breakout '' flash is delayed in time , and vastly reduced in energy , relative to the neutrino and gravity - wave transients produced by core collapse .",
    "however , it conveys useful information about the explosion and the star that gave rise to it .",
    "we are motivated to explore the detection and interpretation of such flashes by several points .",
    "first , breakout flashes provide strong constraints on some properties of their presupernova stars that are poorly determined from the optical light curve .",
    "second , whereas previous searches for these flashes have failed , the planned experiment should routinely discover them .",
    "third , this experiment will report ( within minutes ) the location of almost any core - collapse supernova ( some flashes are extincted ) within its field of view to a distance of many megaparsecs .",
    "data will be downlinked to earth every 90 minutes and analysed via an automated process .",
    "this allows rapid optical follow - up and , in the unlikely case of a very nearby explosion , correlation with neutrino and gravity - wave signals .",
    "early warning and the precise timing of explosion are valuable for the interpretation of the optical light curve : for instance , in calibration of the expanding photospheres method for distance determination .",
    "fourth , flash - selected surveys of type ii supernovae are less biased by competition with light from galactic nuclei than are optical surveys .",
    "finally , there exists the possibility that or a subsequent instrument could detect the signature of asymmetry in the supernova explosion through its effects on the breakout flash .",
    "in this paper we consider primarily what can be determined about the stellar progenitor from the x - ray flash alone , from the flash and an optical distance , or from the delay separating the flash from the core collapse .",
    "our investigation is based on previous numerical calculations of the breakout flash spectrum , primarily by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and on the analytical approximations and scalings derived by @xcite .",
    "our consideration of observational points relies on technical details kindly provided by nigel bannister and the science team .",
    "supernova properties provide a datum at the end of stellar evolution .",
    "collectively , such data from many stars reveal how the intrinsic properties ( e.g. , initial mass , rotation , metallicity ) and extrinsic properties ( e.g. , binary membership and separation ) of massive stars affect their evolution .",
    "it is currently uncertain , for instance , how many supernovae come from relatively compact blue supergiant progenitors and therefore produce underluminous light curves like that of sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "this arises both from a bias against detecting small progenitors , and a bias to overestimate the radius , as discussed below .",
    "x - ray observations have the potential to mitigate the former bias ( table [ t : ratesext ] ) and eliminate the latter (  [ constraints ] ) .    using the scaling relations of @xcite ,",
    "@xcite estimated progenitor properties from the plateau properties of the 13 best - measured type iip sne ( the only ones for which sufficient observations exist ; prior to his work , only sn 1969c had been analyzed in this fashion ) .",
    "based on measurement error , he assigned @xmath1 uncertainties of roughly 0.26 dex ( a factor of 1.8 ) to the derived radii ( and similar uncertainties to mass and explosion energy ) .",
    "several additional sources of uncertainty degrade the determination of progenitor radius derived from optical data .",
    "for one , there is an uncertainty in the underlying distribution of ejecta density and opacity .",
    "the scaling relations of @xcite are derived from a suite of numerical simulations involving an explosion in a simplified version of a red supergiant ( rsg ) model , in which the progenitor density scales with radius as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the size of the star .",
    "@xcite , in comparison , developed analytical formulae for plateau - type light curves , assuming a constant density distribution in the _",
    "ejecta_. although @xcite s results are nominally more precise , being derived from a hydrodynamical calculation of a model star , neither set of formulae account in detail for the presupernova structure of the progenitor  which depends , for instance , on the mass ratio between the star s mantle and its hydrogen envelope .",
    "( simple formulae for the ejecta distributions from supergiants have been presented by @xcite , but have not yet been used to predict light curves ) . for a typical plateau light curve ( absolute v magnitude peaking at -17.5@xmath4 at 70 days ; early photospheric velocity 7000 km / s ;",
    "* ) , the @xcite and @xcite determinations of @xmath3 differ by 0.28 dex or a factor of 1.9 , which is comparable to the observational uncertainties .",
    "this serves as an estimate ( although probably an overestimate ) for the errors due to an unknown ejecta distribution .",
    "additionally , there is a bias toward large values of @xmath3 due to the contamination of the plateau peak by the radioactive decay of @xmath5co produced in the explosion .",
    "the formulae of @xcite and @xcite assume the light curve to be powered by heat deposited in the ejecta by the explosion shock itself .",
    "at the time that photons can diffuse out of the ejecta , this heat supply has been adiabatically degraded during expansion ; the fraction remaining is inversely proportional to the initial stellar radius .",
    "in contrast , @xmath5co , with a half - life of 77.3 days , releases its energy during the plateau .",
    "if the initial radius is small enough , cobalt decay will compete with or even dominate shock - deposited heat . to detect this effect",
    ", one must monitor the late - time decay of the light curve to estimate the cobalt contribution .",
    "nevertheless , the derived progenitor radii are easily corrupted , because there is no simple way to subtract the radioactive contribution from the light curve ; nor is this possible , if the @xmath5co luminosity exceeds that from shock heating . using",
    "the @xcite formulae , we find that radioactivity dominates when @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( an alternate , @xmath8 , will be used later for blue supergiants ) ; the ejecta mass is @xmath9 ; the ejecta opacity is @xmath10 @xmath11 g@xmath12 ; and the explosion energy is @xmath13 erg .    for the fiducial red supergiant ( @xmath14 ) , equation ( [ colum ] ) indicates that @xmath15 or more of @xmath5co would be required to dominate the plateau luminosity .",
    "( this is a large but not impossible amount : see @xcite [ 2003 ] s table 4 ) .",
    "in contrast , reducing the initial radius to @xmath16 , only @xmath17 of @xmath5co is needed to dominate the luminosity .",
    "clearly , one can not detect the existence of blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitors from light curve plateaus if there is even a minute amount of radioactive cobalt .",
    "this can also be seen by solving equation ( [ colum ] ) for the value of @xmath18 below which @xmath5co dominates : @xmath19 this local , power - law solution to the implicit equation ( [ colum ] ) is reasonably accurate for typical doses of @xmath5co .",
    "the scaling @xmath20 indicates that @xmath5co contamination is an issue even for red supergiants .",
    "these difficulties prohibit the use of a catalogue of plateau - phase sn light curves to derive the population of red versus blue supergiant progenitors .",
    "further , such a catalogue would necessarily be biased by the fact that larger stars and those with more @xmath5co have intrinsically brighter optical displays .",
    "there are other means for placing constraints on @xmath3 optically .",
    "one possibility is to locate the progenitor star in previous optical observations and to estimate @xmath3 from the observed luminosity and spectral type ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "of course , this method hinges on whether the progenitor identity can be established from archival data .",
    "alternatively , sufficiently early observations may catch the sn light curve in the phase of self - similar spherical diffusion , during which the light curve is powered by shock - deposited heat escaping from the highest - velocity ejecta @xcite .",
    "this theory constrains the combination @xmath21 rather than @xmath3 alone .",
    "for instance , an application to the early observations of the type ib / c sn 1999ex @xcite yields an estimate @xmath22 . to yield @xmath3",
    ", this method requires a knowledge of the time of explosion , observations of the sn in its first days , and estimates of the distance , explosion energy , and ejected mass .    as we shall show , @xmath3 is the parameter most tightly constrained by the breakout flash .",
    "x - ray observations are thus independent of and complementary to optical follow - up , and provide the early warning needed for @xcite s method .",
    "indeed , x - ray and optical constraints can be merged to provide a more complete picture of the discovered sne .",
    "shock breakout flashes were predicted by @xcite as a source for ( the then undetected ) @xmath23-ray bursts .",
    "@xcite carried out radiation hydrodynamical calculations for the explosions of red giant stars , predicting breakout flashes detectable by the soft x - ray telescope _",
    "heao-1_. unfortunately , the field of view of _ heao-1 _ was insufficient to detect any breakout flashes in the limited duration of the experiment @xcite .",
    "the explosion of sn 1987a , and the realization that archival images of its progenitor indicated a blue rather than a red supergiant star , stimulated a reanalysis of supernova breakout flashes by @xcite and , most recently , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies represent an increase in sophistication toward the full numerical treatment of this complicated , radiation - hydrodynamic problem .",
    "they are consistent with the observed ionization state of circumstellar gas around the sn 1987a remnant @xcite .",
    "the physics of shock breakout and the accompanied flash have also been treated more generally with analytical approximations for many years .",
    "the hydrodynamical problem  that of a shock wave accelerating down a density ramp  was solved in a self - similar idealization by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and used by @xcite in their study of supernova hydrodynamics .",
    "after @xcite s initial suggestion , the physics of the breakout flash was reexamined analytically by @xcite and @xcite ; see  [ physics ] .",
    "we wish to tie together the numerical and analytical work on breakout flashes to predict the detectability by of sne of a wide variety of characteristics .",
    "this requires a method of scaling the results of a numerical simulation to a different progenitor mass , radius , or explosion energy ( or , less importantly , envelope structure ) .",
    "this is made possible by the work of @xcite ( 1999 ; hereafter mm  99 ) , who developed a general analytical approximation that accurately predicts the speed of the explosion shock front .",
    "evaluated at the stellar surface , and combined with @xcite s theory , this gives an estimate of the onset , duration , luminosity , and spectrum in the flash .",
    "although numerical studies predict the spectrum , for instance , more accurately , mm  99 s formulae provide the scaling laws required to generalize them .      in this paper we examine the ability of sensitive , wide - field x - ray detectors ( in particular , the forthcoming instrument ) to constrain the properties of supernovae through observation of the shock breakout flash .",
    "we begin , in  [ physics ] , with a brief overview of the physical processes which generate the breakout flash .",
    "section [ constraints ] describes , in detail , how the intrinsic properties of a supernova and its progenitor star can be gleaned from the characteristics of the x - ray flash .",
    "we attempt to account for the distribution of galactic and extragalactic interstellar x - ray absorption by employing cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) s estimate of the distribution of optical extinctions toward supernovae ; however this distribution is quite uncertain . a brief discussion of the shock travel time and",
    "its usefulness in constraining parameters is included (  [ neutrino ] ) ; unfortunately , is very unlikely to observe a supernova near enough for gravity waves and neutrinos to be detected .",
    "we include a short discussion on the use of instruments other than for detecting breakout flashes (  [ other ] ) ; we conclude that there may be unnoticed breakout flash detections in the archived images of the _ xmm , chandra _ , and _ rosat _ x - ray telescopes . in ",
    "[ discussion ] , we summarize how shock breakout observation can be used as a powerful tool for understanding the end stages of stellar evolution and underline some caveats . in the appendix , we discuss , in greater detail , the significance of the outer density distribution of the progenitor and show how it can be characterized by other stellar parameters .",
    "we model stellar luminosity as a function of stellar mass for presupernova stars and use this relation to estimate the outer density coefficients for blue supergiants .",
    "our analysis improves upon previous work by dealing more generally with breakout flash properties and by modelling more specifically the observation of bursts .",
    "previous work has concentrated on the prediction of the breakout flash from a single star ; the method of scaling used in this work allows for us to describe flashes from a broad range of progenitors ( albeit in less detail ) .",
    "we concentrate on the observation of these events by and the reconstruction of the supernova properties from the data .",
    "we briefly review here some of the physics relevant to breakout flashes here ; however , we refer the reader to @xcite and mm  99 , and references therein for a more thorough discussion .",
    "mm  99 s theory for the speed of the explosion shock front ( their eq . [ 19 ] ) reads @xmath24^{1/2 }     \\left[\\frac{m(r)}{r^3 \\rho_0(r)}\\right]^{0.19}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the explosion energy , @xmath26 labels position within the progenitor , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the progenitor s density and _ ejected _ mass interior to @xmath26 .",
    "this formula accounts in a simple manner for two effects : deceleration as the shock sweeps up new material ( the first bracket ) , and acceleration in regions of sharply declining density ( the second bracket ) . the prefactor is matched to a self - similar solution ; @xcite have given a slightly more accurate form in which this coefficient depends on the shape of the density distribution .",
    "likewise , the exponent 0.19 on the second term can be adjusted ( very slightly ) depending on the slope of the density profile near the stellar surface .",
    "nevertheless , equation ( [ vs ] ) is accurate within @xmath29 , often @xmath30 , as it stands .",
    "the breakout flash itself occurs because supernova shocks are regions of radiation diffusion , and when they get too close to the stellar surface , photons diffuse out into space .",
    "such shocks are driven predominantly by radiation rather than gas pressure , and this is increasingly true as they accelerate through the diffuse subsurface layers . the shock thickness ( @xmath31 )",
    "is therefore determined by the requirement that photons must diffuse upstream across the shock ( in a time @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the optical depth across @xmath31 ) as fast as fluid moves downstream across it ( in a time @xmath34 ) . equating these , @xmath35 we have included a factor @xmath36 which is uncertain at this level of approximation because the shock is a smooth structure ; mm  99 assume @xmath37 , arguing its effect is unimportant .",
    "we retain @xmath38 to show its effect , but note that it always appears below as a coefficient modifying the x - ray opacity @xmath39 .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 decreases as the shock accelerates , but the optical depth to the surface ( @xmath40 ) decreases more rapidly .",
    "once @xmath41 , there is insufficient material to contain the shock , and the photons that constitute it will escape and produce the flash .    to specify the flash s properties , one requires a formula for the subsurface density profile ; mm  99 motivate @xmath42 where @xmath43 is related to the polytropic index @xmath44 via @xmath45 .",
    "hence @xmath46 in an efficiently convecting atmosphere ( i.e. , in red supergiants ) and @xmath47 in a radiative atmosphere of uniform opacity ( blue supergiants ) .",
    "evaluating equation ( [ rho ] ) at @xmath48 results in @xmath49 ; thus , @xmath50 represents the half - radius density .",
    "the outer density distribution of a star can be described by the ratio @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the characteristic density @xmath53 ( see  [ params ] for more detail ) .",
    "finally , one requires the relevant opacity @xmath39 in the expression @xmath54 . since the post - shock temperature is @xmath55  @xmath56 k , mm  99 assumed @xmath39 would be dominated by electron scattering  hence , @xmath57",
    "@xmath11 g@xmath12 for solar metallicity .",
    "we have investigated this assumption for the relevant densities and temperatures using the opal tables @xcite , and find it perfectly valid .",
    "the results of setting @xmath58 are given by mm  99 in their  5.3.3 ; we will not repeat them here .",
    "their formulae ( 36 ) , ( 37 ) , and ( 38 ) give the characteristic temperature @xmath59 ( hence , photon energy @xmath60 ) , flash energy @xmath61 , and radiation diffusion time @xmath62 , respectively ( the latter sets a lower limit for the observed flash duration ) .",
    "we do , however , wish to note several important features of these formulae ( table [ t : mm99eqs ] ) .",

    "for this reason , we will ignore variations of the structural parameter @xmath105 in the current paper , and instead concentrate our attention on @xmath3 , the parameter to which flashes are most sensitive .",
    "we caution , however , that the effect of @xmath105 should be considered in cases where the outer density profile can be determined .",
    "an example would be a radiative envelope of known luminosity ; as discussed by @xcite , @xmath105 becomes very small if the star s luminosity approaches its eddington limit . in the appendix",
    "we present alternative breakout scaling relations that incorporate analytical approximations for @xmath51 .",
    "second , there is a correlation between the photon temperature @xmath59 and diffusion time @xmath62 induced by the physics of shock breakout .",
    "since photon pressure dominates , @xmath59 must satisfy @xmath106 at the point of breakout . and",
    ", since the diffusion time of the shock equals its crossing time , @xmath107 .",
    "these expressions , combined with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , give @xmath110 as we have noted , @xmath57 @xmath11 g@xmath12 for envelopes of roughly solar composition .",
    "insofar as @xmath62 and @xmath59 can be measured , equation ( [ tsetse ] ) provides a means to determine observationally whether the duration of an observed flash is dominated by diffusion across the shock front .",
    "alternatively , the flash duration may be dominated by the finite difference in light travel time between the centre and the limb of the stellar disk @xcite .",
    "we estimate this as @xmath111 although one should keep in mind that the emission pattern at each point on the stellar surface ( i.e. , limb darkening ) will make the effective value of @xmath112 slightly smaller . in general , the observed flash is a convolution of the diffusion and propagation profiles ; hence the total duration is @xmath113 although neither profile is actually gaussian .",
    "returning to equation ( [ tsetse ] ) , one sees that @xmath39 will be underestimated if one substitutes @xmath114 for @xmath62 , provided @xmath115 .",
    "likewise , the characteristic photon temperature can be increased relative to @xmath59 by selective absorption along the line of sight . if one derives @xmath116 by substituting observed quantities in eq .",
    "( [ tsetse ] ) , then either @xmath117 , or extinction is significant , or ( quite likely ) both .",
    "unfortunately , will not view bursts long enough (  [ lobster ] ) to apply this test in the cases where it would be useful .",
    "we concentrate below on other means for constraining sn progenitors .",
    "there are five explosion parameters one would wish to know : the intrinsic parameters @xmath3 , @xmath25 , and @xmath104 ; the distance @xmath118 ; and the obscuring column @xmath119 .",
    "in addition , the structural parameter @xmath51 plays a minor role .",
    "as we shall see in the appendix , @xmath51 is determined approximately by the stellar luminosity ( in bsgs ) or the mass fraction in the outer envelope ( in rsgs ) . in each case",
    ", however , @xmath51 is roughly constant at a characteristic value .    as described in  [ physics ] , the intrinsic parameters of the explosion determine the characteristic properties of the breakout flash : its colour temperature @xmath59 , its total energy @xmath61 , and its duration @xmath114 . in theory",
    ", the full breakout spectrum provides a large number of parameters .",
    "however , we take the view that only these three are independent .",
    "if so , then it is not possible to reconstruct @xmath3 , @xmath25 , and @xmath104 unless @xmath51 is held constant .",
    "variations of @xmath51 around its characteristic value leads to some uncertainty in the other parameters .",
    "the x - ray observables depend on @xmath118 and @xmath119 in addition to @xmath114 , @xmath59 , and @xmath61 .",
    "since there is negligible redshift at the distances in question , @xmath118 affects only the x - ray fluence ( @xmath120 for given @xmath59 ) . for this reason",
    ", @xmath61 can not be known unless @xmath118 can be ascertained from optical followup observations .",
    "given the @xmath121 uncertainty in _",
    "s determination of photon energies @xcite , it provides roughly nineteen independent energy channels (  [ lobster ] ) ; with the burst duration , this makes twenty observables per flash .",
    "however , we use only four parameters in our analysis : three channels ( defined in  [ method ] ) , plus the burst duration @xmath114 .",
    "the motivation for this choice is twofold .",
    "first , there are five desired intrinsic parameters , two of which ( @xmath61 and @xmath118 ) can not be disentangled without optical followup ; therefore only four x - ray observables need be used .",
    "second , if supernovae occur homogeneously within the detection volume , the number of bursts observed scales as the limiting fluence according to @xmath122(fluence)@xmath123 .",
    "the median burst fluence is therefore only @xmath124 above the detection threshold , and can not be described in fine detail .    after describing the instrument (  [ lobster ] ) ,",
    "we describe our method for simulating x - ray observables (  [ method ] ) and our strategy for constraining supernova parameters with these four observables (   [ timing][l - colour ] ) ."
