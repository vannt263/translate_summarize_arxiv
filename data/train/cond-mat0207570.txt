    "the origin of non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior in heavy - fermion ( hf ) systems has been studied intensively in the past decade but is still unclear up to now @xcite .",
    "in particular two different scenarios are discussed for the quantum - critical point ( qcp ) , where long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order emerges from the hf state ; one in which nfl behavior arises from bragg diffraction of the electrons off a critical spin - density wave ( sdw ) @xcite , the other in which the bound - state structure of the composite heavy fermions breaks up at the qcp resulting in a collapse of the effective fermi temperature @xcite . in the sdw scenario , assuming threedimensional ( 3d ) spinfluctuations , singular scattering occurs only along certain `` hot lines '' connected by the vector * q * of the near af order while the remaining fermi surface still behaves as a fermi liquid .",
    "therefore , the low - temperature ( @xmath11 ) specific heat coefficient @xmath20 , that measures the heavy quasiparticle ( qp ) mass , is expected to show an anomalous temperature dependence @xmath31 , but remains finite at the qcp @xcite .",
    "a diverging qp mass , as evident from the @xmath32 behavior found e.g. in the prototypical system cecu@xmath33au@xmath34 for @xmath35 @xcite , would arise only if truly 2d critical spinfluctuations render the entire fermi surface `` hot '' @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , measurements of the inelastic neutron scattering on cecu@xmath16au@xmath17 @xcite showed that the critical component of the spin fluctuations is almost momentum independent leading to the proposal of the locally critical scenario @xcite . since @xmath11-dependent measurements at the qcp alone",
    "provide no information on how the heavy quasiparticles decay into the quantum critical state it is necessary to tune the system away from the magnetic instability in the landau fermi liquid ( lfl ) state and to follow the qp properties upon approaching the qcp . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that magnetic fields can be used for this purpose .",
    "+ in the following , we consider the hf metal ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 for which pronounced nfl phenomena , i.e. , a logarithmic divergence of @xmath20 and a quasi - linear @xmath11-dependence of the electrical resistivity below 10 k , have been observed above a low - lying af phase transition @xcite .",
    "this system is very suitable for such an investigation , because the effect of disorder is negligible in crystals with a residual resistivity of less than 1 @xmath36 cm .",
    "the application of pressure to ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 increases @xmath37 @xcite as expected , because the ionic volume of the magnetic @xmath38 yb@xmath19-configuration is smaller than that of the nonmagnetic @xmath39 yb@xmath40 one .",
    "expanding the crystal lattice by randomly substituting ge for the smaller isoelectric si atoms allows one to tune ybrh@xmath4(si@xmath5ge@xmath6)@xmath4 through the qcp without affecting its electronic properties and without introducing significant disorder to the lattice @xcite . in ybrh@xmath4(si@xmath5ge@xmath34)@xmath4 with the nominal ge concentration @xmath9 ( see below ) the nfl behavior extends to the lowest accessible temperatures , in particular @xmath41 is observed from above 10 k down to 10 mk @xcite . +",
    "this article is organized as follows : after giving details concerning experimental techniques in the next section , we address in section 3 the pronounced nfl behavior at zero magnetic field in thermodynamic , magnetic and transport properties at the qcp in ybrh@xmath4(si@xmath42ge@xmath43)@xmath4 . in section 4",

    "taking the value @xmath48 gpa for the bulk modulus as determined from recent moessbauer measurements under hydrostatic pressure @xcite , this pressure shift corresponds to a volume expansion of 0.1% for the ge - doped sample consistent with a ge content of @xmath49 .",
