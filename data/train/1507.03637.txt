    "weyl semimetals ( wss ) have weyl points , comprised of a linear crossing of valence and conduction bands@xcite near the fermi energy e@xmath4 .",
    "wss can be realized from a lack of time - reversal symmetry ( magnetic ordering , or applied field @xmath5),@xcite or from no inversion symmetry in three - dimensional compounds,@xcite and show peculiar features , such as fermi arcs from surface states connecting two weyl points with different chirality.@xcite experimental evidence has been obtained using x - ray angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite extremely large magnetoresistivity ( xmr ) also occurs in some wss , with a recent analysis by burkov@xcite concluding that xmr should be expected in high mobility semimetals where weyl or dirac points lie near the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "xmr was observed also in the semimetal wte@xmath6 , showing unsaturated mr up to 60 t,@xcite attributed to precise electron and hole carrier compensation , as in bi and other stoichiometric semimetals .",
    "recently a `` nodal loop '' weyl semimetal phase with potentially distinctive properties has been proposed on theoretical grounds@xcite in the nonmagnetic non - centrosymmetric isovalent class taas , tap , nbas , and nbp , whose structure is shown in fig .",
    "1 . a previous proposal of nodal loop wss by phillips and aji invoked time - reversal symmetry breaking@xcite rather than the lack of inversion symmetry of this class of pnictides . since these suggestions , xmr has been observed in both taas@xcite and nbp.@xcite nbp , upon which we focus here , shows xmr of 8,500 at 2 k for @xmath7 t , increasing to @xmath8 at @xmath9 k at @xmath5=30 t , to 10@xmath10 at 60 t , and remains unsaturated.@xcite these colossal xmr values reflect the excellent conduction at low temperatures , with resistivity as low as 0.1@xmath11 cm , and a metal to insulator crossover with field at 100 k and below .",
    "a high mobility @xmath12=@xmath13 @xmath14/v - s and low carrier density of @xmath15 @xmath16 at low @xmath17 was inferred from the conventional single band expressions , which however are not quantitative for multiband semimetals . as temperature increases ,",
    "both the hall coefficient @xmath18 changes sign from electron - like to hole - like and the mobility rapidly changes in the 50 - 150 k range , correlating with the metal to insulator crossover .",
    "a multiband model and additional data will be necessary to sort out individual carrier densities and mobilities .",
    "nbp has the smallest spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of this class , making it the most delicate example of the features of nodal loop wss .    from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints ,",
    "nodal loop semimetals comprise a new class of materials with topological behavior . in this paper , we focus on effects of soc on their electronic properties and evaluate the optical and transport coefficients of nbp , using density functional theory based methods that enable a direct theory - experiment comparison . a central feature that emerges",
    "is electronic fine structure driven by the combination of soc and lack of an inversion center , a feature elaborated on by samokhin@xcite from a model viewpoint .",
    "this splitting in a semimetal with small closed fermi surfaces ( fss ) results in a `` russian doll nested '' pair of fss , and new low energy interband transition strength pilfered from the drude strength by non - centrosymmetry .",
    "the fs character is clarified and low energy collective electronic excitations ( plasmons ) arising from the electronic fine structure are predicted .",
    "while plasmons have been studied in conventional wss,@xcite their appearance in nodal loop wss as well as several other properties discussed here are distinctive when the special `` nodal loop semimetal '' character is encountered .",
    "as shown in fig . [ str ] , nbp has a body - centered tetragonal lattice of the space group @xmath19 ( # 109).@xcite this space group has @xmath20 point group , is non - symmorphic , and ( importantly ) lacks inversion symmetry .",
    "the structure can be pictured as columns of face - shared nbp@xmath21 trigonal prisms oriented along the @xmath22-axis , edge - shared along the @xmath23-axis in one layer .",
    "the trigonal columns are @xmath24 rotated in the next layer along the @xmath25-axis , giving overall tetragonal symmetry . in the structure with the experiment lattice parameters@xcite of @xmath26  , @xmath27  , both nb and p ions lie at @xmath28 positions @xmath29 : @xmath30 @xmath31=0.4176 ; the site symmetry is @xmath32 .",
    "our optimized positions using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional@xcite in fplo@xcite coincided with the experimental values .",
    "this structure leads to nearly identical nb - p bond lengths of 2.53@xmath330.01    and p - nb - p bond angles around 82@xmath34 .",
    "calculations with the experimental structure were performed using the all - electron full - potential code wien2k,@xcite with selected results confirmed with fplo .",
    "all results are based on the pbe - gga exchange - correlation functional .",
    "one objective is to determine the combined effects of soc and the lack of inversion center , since delicate features around @xmath35 are sensitive to soc and become important .",
    "calculation of optical properties including soc is available in wien2k.@xcite the dielectric function @xmath36 , with only diagonal @xmath37 and @xmath38 components due to tetragonal symmetry , is decomposed into the intra- and inter - band contributions .",
    "the imaginary parts of each contribution are given by@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the momentum operator , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are energies of the occupied @xmath43 and unoccupied @xmath44 orbitals , respectively . in the intraband term , which contains the drude divergence for @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the drude plasma frequency and @xmath47 ( chosen to be 10 mev here ) is an inverse scattering lifetime @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding real parts are obtained by the kramers - kronig relation .",
    "the transport calculations were carried out using semiclassical bloch - boltzmann transport theory , implemented in the _ boltztrap _ code@xcite that is interfaced to wien2k .",
    "no approximations beyond the constant scattering time approximation are made . in all calculations performed here ,",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled with a dense @xmath49-mesh up to @xmath50 to treat the semimetallic fine structure carefully . in wien2k ,",
    "the basis size was determined by @xmath51 , and augmented plane - wave sphere radii of 2.5 bohr ( nb ) and 2.14 bohr ( p ) were used .",
    "we first address the electronic structure obtained with fine @xmath49-point and energy meshes .",
    "figure [ band ] shows the gga and gga+soc band structures near e@xmath4 .",
    "semimetallic character with a band crossing along at least three symmetry directions appears , with valence - conduction overlaps mostly of the order of 150 mev .",
    "this band behavior leads to a pseudogap centered 20 mev below @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ band ] ) , with a very small density of states ( dos ) @xmath52=0.046 states / ev per f.u .",
    "while these results are similar to the previous report,@xcite we examine the origins and consequences more completely .",
    "inclusion of soc leads to unconventional consequences . as usual",
    ", soc converts many band crossings along symmetry lines into anticrossings ; here gapping bands by a few tens of mev near e@xmath4 .",
    "however , the lack of inversion symmetry leads to lifting of band degeneracy over entire symmetry planes,@xcite with splittings in the 20 - 200 mev range . in spite of the modest magnitude of soc in @xmath53 nb",
    ", soc will play an important role in determining both the thermal and spectroscopic properties of nbp .",
    "the fss obtained from gga+soc are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fs ] , see the caption for a description .",
    "they are similar to those presented earlier , but they are displayed in an extended zone manner to illustrate their toroidal origin .",
    "have described in detail@xcite the underlying features of the weyl nature of nbp and isovalent partner compounds . without soc , mirror symmetry protected nodal loops lie precisely in the mirror planes @xmath54 and @xmath55=0 .",
    "the nodal loops consist of band degeneracies @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is spin degeneracy ) .",
    "the locus of @xmath58 points at this intersection forms the ring in the @xmath47zn mirror plane , not at constant energy but , for these compounds , in a small energy range including @xmath35 .",
    "the fs intersects the nodal loop , so it must include an even number of doubly degenerate _ fermi points _ where @xmath56 = e@xmath4 .",
    "such nodal loops have also been found in two dimensional srvo@xmath59 nanolayers.@xcite    in this non - centrosymmetric structure , soc splits the bands forming the nodal loops , leaving two symmetry - inequivalent pairs of weyl points ( 12 in all ) near but not on the fss , the points being provided explicitly by weng _",
    "et al._@xcite one lies in the @xmath60 plane , the other at a general @xmath58 point lying near the @xmath47nz plane .",
    "the band splitting is highly anisotropic ; each fs ( fig .",
    "[ fs ] ) consists of a flattened torus ( annulus ) pinched off into one `` boomerang '' containing holes and one `` new moon '' containing electrons .",
    "small doping will alter the position of the pinching , hence changing the number of electron and hole carriers .    for a stoichiometric compound",
    "the fss contain an equal number of holes and electrons , and from calculated band fillings we obtain 4.2@xmath010@xmath1 electron ( hole ) carriers per f.u .",
    "this value corresponds to high velocity carriers of each sign separated on average by 13 lattice constants in each direction .",
    "the rms fermi velocities are @xmath61=3.7 , @xmath62=1.6 , in 10@xmath63 cm / s , a factor of 2.35 in anisotropy .",
    "note that the velocities are typical of _ metallic _ compounds , not semimetals , due to the dispersive bands crossing e@xmath4 , _ i.e. _ the weyl character ( analogous to graphene ) .",
    "for the drude plasma energy , the semimetallic value of @xmath52 but normal metal velocities lead to @xmath64=1.0 ev , @xmath65=0.4 ev .    what can not be seen in fig .",
    "[ fs ] is the doubling of the fss resulting from the interplay of soc with the non - centrosymmetric crystalline symmetry . with the band degeneracy split ,",
    "fermi surfaces become `` russian doll nested '' pairs , one inside the other .",
    "this band - splitting effect has been discussed for pt - based superconductors@xcite and for electronic properties more generally.@xcite the band spitting aspect is effective both in @xmath49-space ( closely nested fermi surfaces ) and in energy , with consequences discussed below .",
    "transport behavior in semimetals is very sensitive to fermiology and to regions of high curvature , but we have found that calculated values based on quasiclassical bloch - boltzmann theory agree very well with observed behavior.@xcite the hall tensor components @xmath66 including soc , displayed in fig .",
    "[ hall](a ) , show a change in sign at @xmath67=125 k , precisely where the experimental r@xmath68 changes sign.@xcite this change of sign is a strong reminder that in a multiband , compensated semimetal , r@xmath68 bears no direct relation to carrier densities.@xcite this statement is particularly true when the fss are strongly non - ellipsoidal and extremely anisotropic .",
    "the experiment - theory agreement reflects not only the precision of the calculations but also the excellent stoichiometry of the samples ; the stoichiometry could not be established precisely but is supported also by the high mobility .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath66 around 250 k is within a factor of 2 of the experimental value .",
    "this is really excellent agreement , because of the compensating contributions from electron and hole surfaces , which have regions of large curvature .",
    "the expression for @xmath18 in bloch - boltzmann theory has the interpretation of giving it as the average of the curvature over the fss .",
    "a strong temperature dependence and a likely change of sign with temperature should be anticipated in nodal loop wss .",
    "the experimental @xmath18 becomes at the lowest temperature two orders of magnitude larger in magnitude than our calculated value , and it is clear from the `` pointed '' fss in fig .",
    "[ fs ] that evaluating r@xmath68 ( which as mentioned is an average of the fs curvature ) at t=0 is a substantial numerical challenge .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath69 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ hall](c ) , decreases with increasing @xmath17 reflecting the strong differences in the electron and hole densities of states .",
    "this variation is different in sign from another xmr compound wte@xmath6,@xcite reflecting different doss of the valence and conduction bands of the two compounds .",
    "the dos at the chemical potential @xmath70 , shown in fig .",
    "[ hall](b ) , is reduced and achieves a minimum around @xmath71 k before turning around .",
    "figure [ seebeck](a ) displays the conductivity tensor components @xmath72 , which incorporates the anisotropy of @xmath46 , which is @xmath735 times larger in - plane .",
    "the @xmath17-dependent seebeck coefficients , shown in fig .",
    "[ seebeck](b ) , have net @xmath74-type sign .",
    "they peak ( in magnitude ) at 100 - 150 k before again becoming small .",
    "the dependence on chemical potential @xmath12 , which can be varied by doping or by gating , is extremely strong near stoichiometry [ see fig .",
    "the near - perfect cancellation of electron and hole contributions ( it is perfect @xmath75 for @xmath12@xmath3 - 15 mev ) at stoichiometry is destroyed , with a maximum of @xmath76 being attained around 0.5% hole doping , or half of that for electron doping .",
    "the sensitivity makes the thermopower an important gauge of the degree of stoichiometry of samples , which otherwise can be very difficult to determine at this low level .",
    "the band splitting induced by soc and the lack of inversion symmetry have qualitative consequences for the optical properties . in _",
    "conventional _ wss where fermi surfaces are simple and model band structures work well , the dielectric response and plasmon signatures of chirality have been well studied.@xcite nodal loop wss bring new processes to the low - energy , small-@xmath77 dielectric response .",
    "they are compensated semimetals thus providing itinerant electron and hole gases .",
    "they are qualitatively different from other semimetals ( including conventional wss ) by having highly non - parabolic and extended fermi surfaces , and of course by having very closely nested fermi surfaces .",
    "new dielectric phenomena must emerge .    without either soc or inversion symmetry breaking",
    ", bands are doubly degenerate and contribute accordingly to the intraband drude response .",
    "in nodal loop wss half of this weight is transferred to finite-@xmath77 , finite-@xmath78 response .",
    "the changes will be appreciable only at small energies , and they should involve new response at very small @xmath77 wavevectors that connect the finely nested fermi surfaces , which are on the order of 10@xmath79@xmath80",
    ". the drude response will be relatively unchanged apart from the factor of 2 reduction in weight , but it may be smeared into the new small-@xmath78 , small-@xmath77 structures .    the energy loss function , shown in fig . [ optic ] with scattering rate @xmath47=10 mev , displays low energy plasmons when soc is included , at 20 mev for @xmath81-axis polarization and double in - plane plasmon peaks at 40 mev and 60 mev .",
    "the strength of these peaks , and to some degree their positions , are dependent on the presumed scattering rate @xmath47",
    ". the anisotropy we calculate at low energy , based on the strong anisotropy of the fermi surfaces , may be consistent with the angle - dependence of the mr measurements.@xcite given the reported high mobility , the plasmon peaks may be much sharper at low temperature than calculated here .",
    "the peaks can be expected also to have temperature dependence , because the varying @xmath82 induces changes and @xmath47 will be t - dependent as well .",
    "above 200 mev , we do not expect significant t - dependence of the spectral behavior .",
    "far - infrared spectroscopy may reveal unusual behavior as temperature , field , polarization , and carrier density are varied and tuned .",
    "our study has illuminated the origins of the unusual and delicate fermi surfaces of nbp . without consideration of spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the electronic structure includes nodal loops@xcite lying in the mirror planes that lead to point fermi surfaces as well as small electron and hole pockets . in this non - centrosymmetric structure ,",
    "spin - orbit coupling removes the spin degeneracy , resulting in russian doll nested pairs of fermi surfaces with a pinched - off annulus topology , with electron surfaces converting to hole surfaces across the pinch .",
    "the resulting electronic fine structure accounts well for the change in sign of the hall coefficient at 100 k , which is also the temperature range in which the magnetoresistance begins to grow in size .",
    "these features identify 10 mev as a relevant energy scale .",
    "the unusual fermi surface also accounts for the lack of universal scaling of xmr in nbp and tap ; spin - orbit coupling is much larger in tap and the fermi surfaces are sensitive to this .",
    "finally , the fine structure in nbp results in the appearance of polarization dependent low energy plasmons in the 20 - 60 mev range .",
    "this study substantially broadens the understanding of how ws behavior impacts the physical properties of nbp , which should also apply in similar form to nbas , tap , and taas .",
