    "a fundamental effect caused by the interplay of nonlinearity with symmetric potentials is spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",

    "the nonlinear term may break the symmetry of the ground state , replacing it by an asymmetric one which minimizes the energy of the system , provided that the strength of the nonlinearity exceeds a certain critical value ( see ref .",

    "@xcite for the consideration of the ssb of self - trapped states in bec ) .",
    "the experimental realization of the ssb in double - well potentials was reported in bec markus ( this was done in the condensate with the self - repulsive nonlinearity , which implies the spontaneous breaking of the _ antisymmetry _ of the lowest - energy antisymmetric mode ) and in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "the _ symmetry - breaking bifurcation _ , which destabilizes the original symmetric ground state and gives rise to the ssb in the nonlinear systems , was originally predicted in a discrete model of self - trapping @xcite . in nonlinear optics ,",

    "the allied bifurcation for solitons in nonlinear dual - core fibers was studied in detail in ref .",
    "later , the ssb was studied for gap solitons in the model of the dual - core fiber bragg gratings with the same cubic nonlinearity as in the ordinary fibers @xcite .",
    "the ssbeffects were also predicted for matter - wave solitons in the self - attractive bec loaded into a double - channel potential trap @xcite-@xcite .",
    "typically , the self - attractive cubic nonlinearity gives rise to the soliton bifurcations of the subcritical ( _ backward _ ) type ( in other words , these are phase transitions of the first kind ) . in that case ,",
    "branches of asymmetric modes emerge as unstable ones , going backward ( i.e. , in the direction of the decrease of the soliton s norm ( energy ) ) .",
    "they get stabilized after switching the evolution direction forward at turning points of the bifurcation diagram @xcite .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the combination of the self - focusing nonlinearity with a periodic potential applied in the free direction ( perpendicular to the direction of the action of the double - well potential ) tends to change the character of the soliton bifurcation from sub- to supercritical ( i.e. , replace the phase transition of the first kind by a transition of the second kind ) . in the supercritical case ,",

    "the bifurcation for gap solitons in the dual - core fiber bragg grating is of the forward type too @xcite .    a challenging alternative to the use of the ordinary linear double - well potential is the setting based on an effective nonlinear potential , alias _ pseudopotential _ ( as it is called in solid - state physics harrison ) , which is induced by the double - peak spatial modulation of the local strength of the self - focusing nonlinearity .",

    "it is relevant to mention that ssb effects were also analyzed for discrete solitons in dual - core nonlinear chains , with the uniform linear coupling between them @xcite , as well as with the linear coupling which links a single pair of sites in the parallel chains @xcite .",
    "the form of the linear coupling determines the type of the respective ssb bifurcation , which is subcritical in the former case , and supercritical in the latter situation .",
    "the action of the nonlinearity concentrated at a pair of sites embedded into a single linear chain was studied too @xcite .",
    "the ssb effects in this setting ( for both straight and circular host linear chains ) were analyzed in recent work @xcite .",
    "the ssb in a similar system , with a pair of symmetric nonlinear sites side - coupled to the infinite linear chain , was recently studied in ref .",
    ".    an obviously relevant generalization of the work outlined above is extension to two - component systems . in bec , this implies a mixture of two different hyperfine states of the same atomic species @xcite , while in optics it implies the co - propagation of light beams mixing two different polarizations of light , or different carrier wavelengths .",
    "recently , the ssb , along with the related dynamical effect of josephson oscillations between the wave functions trapped in adjacent potential wells , have been analyzed in diverse models of binary systems embedded into ordinary ( linear ) potentials of the double - well type @xcite .",
    "an experiment was performed too , for the corresponding bec mixture @xcite .",
    "however , ssb effects have not yet been studied in two - component systems trapped in double - well _ nonlinear _ ( pseudo)potentials . a straightforward possibility to implement the latter setting can be found in nonlinear optics , where the spatially nonuniform nonlinearity , which forms the double - well structure , will act similarly on both polarization components , in the form of the spm ( self - phase modulation ) , as well as on the xpm  ( cross - phase - modulation ) nonlinear interaction between them @xcite .    in this work",

    "another generic feature of the bifurcation , which is responsible for the merger of the broken - as - as branch back into its unbroken counterpart , is that this happens when one norm is much larger than the other  typically , at @xmath124 while @xmath125 .",
    "the existence of modes with unbroken or broken mixed symmetry , of the s - as type , is another obvious difference of the two - component system from its single - component predecessor .",
    "as might be expected , these solutions exist only in the region of the @xmath126 plane where the sm - sm and as - as states coexist .",
    "the global structure of the s - as family with the broken symmetry and antisymmetry is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] by means of plots showing the asymmetry measures of its initially symmetric ( @xmath127 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath128 ) components , as well as the total energy , vs. the norms .",
    "since the pattern of the solutions is rather complex , we complement fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] by fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] , where the projection of the three - dimensional plots of the asymmetry measure of components @xmath127 and @xmath129 from figs .",
    "[ f-10](a),(b ) onto the two - dimensional planes of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively , is presented .",
    "[ f-10 ]    \\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    these plots are very different from those for the sm - sm and as - as  modes , cf . figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig4 ] . to consider the relation between the mixed - symmetry modes with the their sm - sm and as - as counterparts , it is relevant to stress , that , as may be naturally expected , the branch of s - as solutions with unbroken ( anti)symmetries smoothly merges into the corresponding solutions on the sm - sm type in the limit of the vanishing norm @xmath44 in the as component . on the other hand ,",
    "when the latter norm ( @xmath44 ) increases , the energy of the system increases too , and the configuration smoothly approaches the opposite limit of the as - as solution . if chemical potential @xmath102 is large enough , the latter limit corresponds to vanishing norm @xmath43 of the sm component .",
    "however , for @xmath132 , the @xmath133-norm does _ not _ vanish in the limiting case ; instead , it approaches some finite value , whereas the @xmath44-norm rapidly diverges , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in fact , this singular behavior is a peculiarity of the model with the @xmath26-functions ( @xmath23 ) , while at @xmath34 ( in the model with a finite width of the pseudopotential wells ) the situation is different , as shown in the next section .    as well as in the cases considered above , the states of the s - as type with the broken ( anti)symmetries emerge from their  unbroken \" counterparts through a bifurcation ( i.e. , they are connected ) .",
    "we discuss this bifurcations in more detail below , considering the model with finite @xmath15 .",
    "it can also be checked , using detailed results of the numerical analysis , that , similar to the case of the sm - sm modes , the norms and energy of the s - as states monotonously grow with the increase of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which , in particular , means that the norms are in one - to - one correspondence with the chemical potentials , also similar to the case of the sm - sm modes , and in contrast to their as - as counterparts .",
    "lastly , comparing fig . [ fig5](c ) to fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , we conclude that , for the same values of norms @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the energy of the s - as modes is essentially higher than the energy of the fundamental sm - sm states , which suggests that the s - as states may be more vulnerable to dynamical instabilities .",
    "the results reported in the previous section were based on the numerical solution of coupled cubic equations ( [ a])-([d ] ) , which were derived from the analysis of the singular version of the model , with the nonlinear potential represented by the symmetric set of two @xmath26-functions , see eqs . ( [ udelta ] ) and ( [ vdelta ] ) .",
    "it is known from the analysis of the single - component model that this limit case , corresponding to @xmath134 in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) , is degenerate in several aspects ( in particular , the symmetric mode exists only up to a finite value of the norm , see eq .",
    "( interval ) ) . in the single - component model ,",
    "the degeneracy was lifted by the transition to the nonlinearity - modulation function in the general form ( [ g ] ) , with finite @xmath15 ( recall that the modulation function keeps its double - well shape up to @xmath135 ) .",
    "another generic difference of the situation with finite @xmath15 is that , unlike the case of the nonlinear potential represented by the @xmath26-functions , smooth modulation function ( [ g ] ) may support localized patterns with local maxima shifted from the bottom points , @xmath60 .",
    "we have expanded the analysis of the two - component system to the general case of @xmath136 taken in the form of ( [ g ] ) with @xmath34 . as demonstrated below",
    ", the shape of various modes and bifurcations of the respective branches strongly alter , against the limit of @xmath23 , starting from values @xmath137 ( in the single - component model , the essential change in the picture of stationary modes was observed in , roughly , the same range @xcite ) .",
    "all the types of the two - component modes , i.e. , sm - sm , as - as , and s - as , in their symmetry - broken and unbroken forms alike , feature strong changes against the case of @xmath23 in this region .",
    "in fact , these changes are strongly affected by additional modes with broken ( anti)symmetry , which appear , at @xmath15 large enough , still in the _ single - component _ model .",
    "these modes were not found in ref .",
    "@xcite , because they are generated  from nothing \" by saddle - node bifurcations , that are disconnected from the symmetry - breaking bifurcation for the symmetric mode , and the stabilization transition for the non - bifurcating antisymmetric one , on which the analysis was focused in ref .",
    "therefore , in this section we first present the new results for the single - component model , and then report , in a rather brief form , changes which occur to the compound modes in the two - component system .",
    "a full description of the bifurcations in the two - component system with @xmath138 turns out to be extremely complex , as there is a large number of ramifications of the bifurcation scenarios .",
    "some comments are relevant too as concerns the numerical methods used for the search of localized solutions to ode system ( [ u ] ) , ( [ v ] ) with @xmath139 .",
    "in addition to the obvious fact that the numerical analysis had to cover the three - dimensional parameter space , ( @xmath15 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , one of difficulties in the numerical study is related to the fact that , for some solutions that had to be obtained , components @xmath20 and @xmath21 feature very different ( up to a few orders of magnitude ) variation rates .",
    "another problem is that , because for small @xmath15 the coupling between the equations is confined to small neighborhoods of points @xmath60 , it was necessary to use a numerical scheme with a higher density of grid points in those areas .    one  numerical method that was used to solve the system of equations ( [ u ] ) and ( [ v ] ) was based on the shooting algorithm @xcite , which is , actually , better suited for producing the solution at smaller values of @xmath140 .",
    "another approach , using the centered - difference - approximation method , turns out to be more appropriate for larger @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , the application of the shooting method was assisted by the fact that , for smallest values of @xmath15 , the solution has to be close to that available in the analytical form given by eqs .",
    "( [ ulinear ] ) and ( [ vlinear ] ) for @xmath141 . this fact provided a good initial guess for the shooting method at @xmath142 .",
    "an important issue was also the choice of the shooting point .",
    "the method did not work with these points taken at @xmath143``infinity '' , but it worked well when the point was set in the middle of either nonlinear - potential well ( see eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) ) . by means of this technique ,",
    "@xmath144 solutions for the localized modes had been collected , which made it possible to formulate general conclusions about the bifurcation scenarios in the two - component system .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , no bifurcations were found on the branch of single - component antisymmetric modes , both for @xmath23 ( where this result was exact ) and for finite @xmath15 ( in the numerical form ) .",
    "our analysis complies with those conclusions . nevertheless , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , our numerical studies , performed at finite @xmath15 , reveal saddle - node bifurcations ( more than a single one , see fig .",
    "[ fig6](c , d ) ) , that generate pairs of single - component modes with broken antisymmetry , which are disjoint from the branch with the unbroken antisymmetry ( for this reason , they were not found in ref .",
    "an example of the pair of the newly found solutions with the broken antisymmetry is displayed in fig .",
    "an essential peculiarity of these modes , which is seen , for instance , in the case of the lower mode displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , is that they tend to be trapped in a single nonlinear - potential well , instead of being spread between both , which is the case for the mode with the unbroken antisymmetry . it will be shown below that such modes , essentially trapped in a single pseudopotential well , play an essential role in bifurcation scenarios of compound modes of the as - as and s - as types in the two - component system at finite @xmath15 .    [ f-21 ]    \\(a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d )    [ f-17b ]    \\(a ) ( b )    furthermore , we observe similar saddle - node bifurcations of symmetric and asymmetric solutions in the single - component model .",
    "in particular , a pair of new symmetric - solution branches , generated by such a bifurcation , is displayed in fig .",
    "these bifurcations take place on the  old \" symmetric and asymmetric branches at some critical values of @xmath15 ( in contrast to the bifurcations displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which are disconnected from the  old \" branch of the antisymmetric solutions ) . for the asymmetric and symmetric solutions",
    ", this happens at @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively ( the bifurcation which gives rise to the pair of the asymmetric branches is not displayed here ) .",
    "as @xmath15 grows beyond these critical values , the new branches move away from the parent ones .",
    "it may happen that more pairs of branches emerge through additional saddle - node bifurcations ( cf .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where two such bifurcations are shown for the broken antisymmetric solutions ) , but we did not aim to look for them .",
    "the difference of the newly emerging symmetric states from the original one , which evolves continuously starting from @xmath147 , is that , at relatively large values of @xmath15 , the original mode features a single - peak shape , while the new solutions are shaped as twin - peak modes , see fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) .    [ f-19 ]    \\(a ) ( b ) ( c )      to understand the evolution of the sm - sm branches at finite @xmath15 in the two - component system , we select a characteristic value , @xmath148 .",
    "the analysis was performed by fixing chemical potential @xmath40 which is associated with component @xmath127 , and scanning the configuration space of the system by letting vary the other chemical potential , @xmath41 , which is associated with component @xmath128 . at all values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "branches of solutions of the sm - sm types with unbroken and broken symmetries , have been found , the former ones always having lower energy ( h ) , which suggests that the symmetry breaking may tend to destabilize the modes .",
    "the branch of the sm - sm solutions with the broken symmetry smoothly arises from the corresponding _ single - component _ asymmetric state , trapped in one of the nonlinear potential wells . in the course of its evolution following the variation of @xmath41 , this branch evolves towards the other well , where the _ other _ component of the  broken \" sm - sm solution approaches the respective asymmetric state of the single - component model , while the mate component vanishes .",
    "similarly , the sm - sm branch with the unbroken symmetry arises from the corresponding symmetric solution of the single - component model , at some critical value of @xmath41 , and eventually merges into another symmetric state , in which , again , only a single component is present , but the other one .",
    "thus , in both cases of the sm - sm modes with broken and unbroken symmetries , the evolution along the branch of the two - component solutions essentially amounts to the conversion of one single - component mode ( resp . ,",
    "asymmetric or symmetric ) into the mode represented by the originally missing component , while the opposite one vanishes .",
    "these bifurcation scenarios for the sm - sm branches are illustrated by fig .",
    "they persist in the interval of @xmath149 .",
    "[ f-30 ]    \\(a ) ( b )    at @xmath150 , the system keeps the scenarios described above , but also gives rise to new ones , which involve the additional symmetric modes in the single - component model generated by the saddle - node bifurcation ( see figs .",
    "[ fig7](b ) and [ fig8 ] ) . in particular , at @xmath151 for fixed @xmath152 .",
    "we observe that , if @xmath103 remains relatively small , the increase of @xmath102 leads to a bifurcation between the  broken \" and  unbroken \" s - as modes . as @xmath153    \\(a ) fig17a.ps ( b ) fig17b.ps    another look at the evolution of the s - as branches is suggested by the general circumstance , similar to that emphasized above , in the course of the analysis of the solution families of the sm - sm and as - as types , _",
    "viz_. , that various branches of two - component solutions may be realized as links connecting the basic modes of the three types : the two - component ones with the unbroken ( anti)symmetry , single - component symmetric / antisymmetric / asymmetric states , and the other above - mentioned species of single - component solutions , which are almost entirely localized in one well of the nonlinear potential .",
    "below , we refer to these three basic types of the modes as a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "in particular , the picture of the evolution of the  broken \" s - as branches , as described above , may be interpreted so that the broken-(anti)symmetry branch evolves from state a towards b. for example , at small values of @xmath103 , the  broken \" s - as states are weakly localized , and the increase of @xmath102 drives the system towards state b without bifurcations . at @xmath154 , the asymmetry of the as component changes its sign , but there is still no bifurcation , with energy ( [ h ] ) monotonically depending on norms @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    at @xmath155 , there emerges the above - mentioned single - component mode ( c ) , strongly localized in one well of the nonlinear potential , with a result that the as state tends to be trapped near this mode , before it will be driven to mode b. this circumstance changes results of the bifurcation , as can be observed in terms of the asymmetries and energy in figs .",
    "fig15 and [ fig17](a ) .",
    "another interpretation is that there is an additional state which appears at the bifurcation point , built as a combination of a symmetric mode in one component and a new as mode with broken antisymmetry , see fig  [ f-14 ] .",
    "this means that three branches are observed in this region , with the evolving one attracted to state c and oscillating about it for a while , before plunging to the limit of the vanishing as component ( state b ) .",
    "[ f-23 ]    \\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    [ f-14 ]    \\(a ) ( b )    the picture of the evolution of the s - as branches outlined above is valid in the interval of @xmath156 .",
    "additional ramifications of the picture , which are not presented here , are revealed by the analysis at larger values of @xmath15 .",
    "in this work , we have introduced the two - component one - dimensional model with the nonlinear ( pseudo)potential represented by two strongly localized potential wells .",
    "the subject of the analysis is the evolution of various two - component modes of the three types : sm - sm ( symmetric - symmetric ) , as - as(antisymmetric - antisymmetric ) , and s - as ( mixed states with symmetric and antisymmetric components ) , and the related ssb ( spontaneous - symmetry - breaking ) effects . in the limit of the nonlinearity modulation represented by the set of two @xmath26-functions ,",
    "the solution was obtained in the semi - analytical form .",
    "the consideration of this solution demonstrates new features of the two - component modes with spontaneously broken ( anti)symmetries , which are qualitatively different from what was previously reported in the single - component model . in particular",
    ", the spontaneous breaking of the antisymmetry is possible only in the two - component system , and , obviously , s - as states , with the unbroken or broken mixed symmetry exist only in the two - component system .    in the model based on the set of two nonlinear potential wells of a finite width , the evolution and bifurcation scenarios were found to be still more complex .",
    "first , new results for the case of finite potential wells were reported for the single - component model .",
    "these are pairs of modes with the broken antisymmetry , and pairs of twin - peak symmetric modes , generated by isolated saddle - node bifurcations , in either case . then , numerous complex scenarios of the evolution of the sm - sm , as - as , and s - as branches with the broken ( anti)symmetries may be interpreted in terms of routes linking three species of basic modes : two - component states with the unbroken ( anti)symmetries ,  unbroken \" or  broken \" single - component states featuring density peaks in both nonlinear - potential wells , and , finally , single - component states effectively trapped in a single well .",
    "it remains to systematically analyze the stability of diverse two - component stationary modes reported in this work .",
    "challenging problems may also be to extend the model to a set of several nonlinear spots , including a periodic lattice , and , on the other hand , to develop the two - dimensional ( 2d ) version of the two - component system , following the recent analyses of the 2d extensions of the single - component model @xcite .",
