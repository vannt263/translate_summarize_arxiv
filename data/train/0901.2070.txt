    "the task of determining good trading strategies is a fundamental problem in mathematical finance .",
    "a typical approach to this problem aims at finding the trading strategy that maximizes , for example , the final expected utility , which is defined as a deterministic , concave , and increasing function @xmath5 of the final wealth .",
    "there are , however , many applications where a utility function has to change with the underlying securities , or more generally , with the source of randomness ( say a brownian motion ) .",
    "for example , in the so - called _ optimal partial replication _ of a contingent claim , introduced by fllmer and leukert @xcite , one tries to find the trading strategy that best replicates the claim @xmath6 under a budget constraint .",
    "in particular , when the market is incomplete , it is often more beneficial to allow certain degree of  shortfall \" in order to reduce the  super hedging cost \" , a threshold for the minimum initial wealth so that super - hedging is feasible ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "mathematically , such a shortfall risk could be measured by the expected loss @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the  loss function \" , a convex increasing function that incorporates the investor s attitude towards the shortfall @xmath9 , and the value process @xmath10 is subject to the constraint @xmath11 .",
    "such a problem can then be formulated as a utility maximization problem with a bounded _ state - dependent utility _ , in which the utility function is defined by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath12    in general , we can define a _ state - dependent utility _ as a function @xmath13 such that @xmath14 is a utility function for each @xmath15 .",
    "the utility maximization problem is then defined as @xmath16          : \\ ;",
    "v\\;{\\rm is}\\;{\\rm admissible}\\;{\\rm and } \\ ;          v_{0}\\leq{}z \\right\\},\\ ] ] where the supreme is taken over all wealth processes @xmath17 generated by admissible trading strategies ( see section [ finmodelsect ] for a precise definition ) .",
    "the existence and essential uniqueness of the solution to the problem ( [ primalproblemreal ] ) was proved in @xcite for a general semimartingale price model using a convex duality method , built on a celebrated bipolar theorem by kramkov and schachermayer @xcite . however",
    ", this approach does not seem to shed any light on how to compute , in a feasible manner , the optimal trading strategy .",
    "this is partly due to the generality of the problem considered there . in this paper",
    "we shall consider the market model in which the price is driven by a lvy process , and we propose a more manageable dual problem with a specific domain .",
    "we should note that our method can be extended to handle more general jump - diffusion models driven by even additive processes .",
    "the problem of utility maximization can be traced back to merton @xcite-@xcite . in a brownian - driven market model , karatzas et .",
    "@xcite developed a program , known as the _ convex duality method _",
    ", that has become one of the most powerful methods , yet relatively explicit and simple , to analyze optimal portfolio problems in non - markovian markets .",
    "they prove that the marginal utility of the optimum final wealth is proportional to the risk - neutral local martingale that minimizes a  dual \" problem , defined as another optimization problem with the objective function being the legendre - fenchel - type transformation of the original utility function . to be more precise ,",
    "consider a minimization problem @xmath18 , \\qquad y>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , the so - called _ dual domain or class _ , consists of ( risk - neutral ) exponential local martingales , and @xmath20 stands for the _ convex dual function _ of @xmath21 .",
    "the idea is first to find , for any @xmath22 , a minimizer @xmath23 of ( [ dualprob0 ] ) , which in turn induces a  potential \" optimal terminal wealth @xmath24 in the sense that the so - called weak duality relation @xmath25\\ ] ] holds . if one can further show that for some @xmath26 , there exists an admissible portfolio @xmath27 such that @xmath28 , then clearly equality holds in ( [ wd ] ) ( a property typically called _ strong duality _ ) , and @xmath27 solves the original problem .",
    "customarily , finding the optimal portfolio @xmath27 relies on a variational problem for the dual value function and the existence of the minimizer @xmath29 utilizes the particular form of the market model and some general properties of the utility function .",
    "more recently , the convex duality method was further extended to a general `` jump - diffusion '' market by kunita @xcite building on an exponential representation for _ positive _ local supermartingales as well as a variational equality for the dual problem . to ensure the attainability of the dual problem",
    ", it is required that the utility function satisfies the same conditions as @xcite ( one of which is unboundedness ) , and that the dual domain @xmath19 contain all positive `` risk - neutral '' local supermartingales .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to further extend the seminal approach of @xcite to the case of _ state - dependent , bounded _",
    "utility functions . for simplicity ,",
    "we will be contented with a market with only one stock , whose jumps are driven by a lvy process @xmath30 , but our analysis can be readily extended to more general jump - diffusion multidimensional models such as the one considered in @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that the boundedness and potential non - differentiability of the utility function causes some technical subtleties .",
    "for example , the dual optimal process can be @xmath31 with positive probability , thus the representation theorem of kunita does not apply anymore . to get around these difficulties",
    "we shall reconsider the dual problem over an arbitrary subclass . using an exponential representation for nonnegative supermartingales due to fllmer and kramkov @xcite",
    ", we show how to construct suitable explicit dual classes associated with certain classes of semimartingales that are closed under mery s topology . to work with this last condition",
    ", we prove a closure property for integrals with respect to poisson random measures , a result of interest on its own that extends the analog property for integrals with respect to a fixed semimartingale due to mmin @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that part of our approach relies on the fundamental characterization of contingent claims that are super - replicable ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , while that of fllmer and leukert @xcite ( see also xu @xcite ) was based on the bipolar theorem of @xcite .",
    "we feel that the convex duality approach of @xcite that we develop in this paper offers several advantages .",
    "the proofs are more direct and the dual problem might be more suitable for computational purposes since the dual class enjoys an `` explicit '' description and `` parametrization '' . in the case that",
    "( i ) the jumps of the price process @xmath32 are driven by the superposition of finitely - many shot - noise poisson processes or that ( ii ) @xmath2 , we are even able to show that the dual solution is a risk - neutral local martingale .    we would like to remark that some of our results in section [ convdualsect ] below may look similar to those in ( * ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) , but there are essential differences . for example , the model in @xcite exhibits only finite - jump activity , while our model allows general jumps . also , @xcite allows only downward price jumps , an assumption that seems to be crucial for the approach there , which was based on the existence of the solutions to certain stochastic differential equations ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.3 , proposition 3.4 ) )",
    ". we should point out that our approach is also valid for general additive processes , including the time - inhomogeneous cases considered in @xcite .",
    "we present an argument in ( ii ) of section [ fnlrmrkssect ] to justify this point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ finmodelsect ]",
    "we introduce the financial model , along with some basic terminology that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the convex duality method is revised in section [ convdualsect ] , where a potential optimal final wealth satisfying ( [ wd ] ) is constructed .",
    "an explicit description of a dual class for which equality in ( [ wd ] ) holds is presented in section [ specdualclsssect ] , along with some interesting simple characterizations of the dual optimum . in particular , as it was mentioned earlier , we prove that under certain conditions in the structure of the jumps , the dual optimum is actually a local martingale and we also provide an explicit characterization of the admissible trading strategies . in section [ rplcbltysect ] we show that the potential optimal final wealth is attained by an admissible trading strategy , as the last step for proving the existence of an optimal portfolio . finally , we give some concluding remarks in section [ fnlrmrkssect ] .",
    "some necessary fundamental theoretical results behind our approach are collected in appendix [ covclsssect ] , such as the exponential representation for nonnegative supermartingales of fllmer and kramkov @xcite and the closure property for integrals with respect to poisson random measures that was previously mentioned .",
    "throughout this paper we assume that all the randomness comes from a complete probability space @xmath33 , on which there is defined a lvy process @xmath0 with lvy triplet @xmath34 ( see sato @xcite for the terminology ) . by the lvy - it decomposition ,",
