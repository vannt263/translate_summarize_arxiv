    "the remote implementation of quantum operation ( rio ) is defined as that a quantum operation performed on the local system(alice s one ) is teleported and acts on an unknown state belonging to the remote system ( bob s ) @xcite . in ref.@xcite and subsequent research@xcite ,",
    "the authors conclude that , the optimal locc(local operation and classical communication ) procedure to implement remotely an arbitrary unitary operator @xmath0 on a qudit with the shared entanglement is by the means of  bidirectional state teleportation \" .",
    "furthermore , the remote implementation of a unitary transformation on the state of a qubit is studied@xcite . just as the teleportation @xcite of an unknown quantum state , in the process of rio , entangled states are used .",
    "however , the cost of entanglement resources is dependent on whether quantum operations are unknown or partially unknown ( known ) .",
    "when it comes to the `` partially unknown operation '' , it implies that the quantum operation satisfies some given restricted conditions . as in the reference @xcite , the authors considere the case of two kinds of one - qubit operations ,",
    "one of them only has non - zero diagonal elements : arbitrary rotations around a fixed direction @xmath1 , the other just has non - zero offdiagonal elements : it a @xmath2 rotation about an arbitrary direction lying in a plane orthogonal to @xmath1 . for the cases more than one qubit , for example , n qubits case ,",
    "wang @xcite proves that the quantum operations only with one non - zero element in every row and every column of their representation matrices can be able to be implemented remotely in a faithful and determined way , if we only have n @xmath3-bits and use hadamard gates to transfer the effect of operation to bob s qubits . in this paper ,",
    "our motivation is just to present a scheme of remote implementation of partially unknown quantum operations of two qubits based on the well - known technology and method .",
    "recently , by using a linear optics set - up , a remote rotation by @xmath4 about the @xmath5 axis has been implemented experimentally on the target photons@xcite .",
    "moreover , the authors claim that the scheme can be generalized to implement the single qubit subsets discussed in@xcite .",
    "cavity qed @xcite , optical systems @xcite , ion trap @xcite and nmr @xcite are all used to demonstrate quantum information processing and quantum computation . recently , cavity qed technology has attracted a lot of interest . in this context , cavity qed with circular rydberg atoms and superconducting cavities",
    "presents a peculiar interest . in cavity",
    "qed , quantum logic gates are constructed @xcite ; bell - state @xcite , ghz state(w state ) @xcite , even the @xmath6-particle entangled state @xcite are generated .",
    "some important tasks of quantum information processing and quantum communication , such as teleportation @xcite , quantum state sharing @xcite and grover s search ( @xcite and the references in ) are successfully implemented by using cavity qed . some of experimental demonstrations of quantum information and quantum computation in cavity qed have also been proposed @xcite .    in this paper , by constructing the recovery operations of remote implementation of two - qubit partially unknown quantum operations ,",
    "we find it is possible to carry out the quantum information processing in cavity qed",
    ". then we present the scheme in cavity qed and analyze its experimental feasibility .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec2 ] , a simple introduction of wang s protocol is presented and the recovery operations are constructed ; in sec.[sec3 ] , the scheme of remote implementation of two - qubit partially unknown quantum operation in cavity qed is presented ; finally , in sec.[sec4 ] , we present the discussion and conclusion .",
    "the structure of the two - qubit partially unknown quantum operations which can be remotely implemented and the recovery operation are presented in ref.@xcite . because there is only one nonzero element in every row and every column of the matrices of the two - qubit operations , there are 24 kinds of operations .",
    "they can be written as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the corresponding elements of @xmath9 , which is the permutations of the list @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "so @xmath12 . a part of the recovery operation : @xmath13 as the above @xmath14 .",
    "the recovery operations correspond to the two - qubit quantum operations by alice sends the @xmath15 to bob with 5 bits .",
    "we briefly recall the remote implementation of two - qubit partially unknown quantum operation @xcite .",
    "two entangled states @xmath16 work as the channel , qubits @xmath17 belong to alice and @xmath18 belong to bob . another two qubits @xmath19 in an unknown state @xmath20 belong to bob too .",
    "two - qubit partially unknown quantum operations acted by alice can work on qubits @xmath18 as follows .",
    "bob first performs two controlled - not ( @xmath21 ) transformations by using @xmath19 as control qubits and @xmath18 as target qubits , respectively .",
    "then he measures his qubits @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the computational basis @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and sends the results to alice . after receiving the two bits",
    ", alice carries out the quantum operations @xmath26 on her two qubits @xmath17 respectively .",
    "subsequently , she acts @xmath27 on @xmath28 and executes two hadamard gate transformation @xmath29 . in the end",
    ", she measures her two qubits in the basis @xmath30 and sends the results and @xmath15 to bob . as having been mentioned",
    ", the transmission of @xmath15 is to let bob choose @xmath31 correctly . with this information ,",
    "bob s recovery operations are @xmath32_{y_{1 } } \\otimes[(1-a_{2})\\sigma_{0}+(a_{2}\\sigma_{3})]_{y_{2}}\\right\\ } r_{2}(x)_{y_{1}y_{2}}.\\ ] ] with this steps , the two - qubit partially unknown operations can be remotely implemented on qubits @xmath33 .    the possible obstacle to demonstrate the protocol is the recovered operation @xmath31 .",
    "fortunately , we can construct @xmath31 by using the @xmath21 gate and the not gate @xmath34 .",
    "actually , this comes from the fact that any multiqubit logic gate can be decomposed as @xmath21 transformations and single qubit logic gates @xcite .",
    "we have : @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 means that we use qubit @xmath38 as the control qubit , @xmath39 as the target qubit to do the controlled - not transformation , and @xmath40 means we use qubit @xmath39 as the control qubit and qubit @xmath38 as the target qubit .",
    "in addition , @xmath41 is the pauli matrices , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the @xmath44 identity matrix .",
    "in the original protocol@xcite , after constructing the recovery operations , all the operations to remotely implement two - qubit partially unknown quantum operations are two - qubit @xmath21 gate , single qubit logic gates : hadamard gate and pauli operations .",
    "the quantum resources we need is just two @xmath3-bits .",
    "all of them can be realized by using cavity qed .",
    "as we have shown in the introduction , the preparation of two - qubit entangled states has been demonstrated in many papers@xcite . in the reference",
    "@xcite , zheng and guo proposed a realizable scheme of two - atom controlled - not gate in cavity qed . in the protocol",
    ", ladder - type three - level(denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) atoms are used . in order to make sure that @xmath46 is not affected by the atom - cavity interaction ,",
    "the transition frequency between the state @xmath47 and @xmath46 is highly detunned from the cavity frequency .",
    "let us start with considering two identical ladder - type three - level atoms simultaneously interacting with a single cavity .",
    "there is no energy exchange between the atomic system and the cavity under the approximation @xmath48 . in the case of the cavity field in the vacuum state ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is given by : @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with @xmath52 being the ground and excited states of the atom .",
    "@xmath53 are the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity mode .",
    "@xmath54 is the atom - cavity coupling strength , and @xmath55 is the detuning between the atomic transition frequency @xmath56 and cavity frequency @xmath57 .",
    "now , the @xmath21 gate can be realized as follows@xcite : atom 2 passes through classical field tuned to the transitions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the amplitudes and phases of which are appropriately chosen , so we have : @xmath60 after this , we send the atom 1 and 2 into the nonresonant cavity eq.([nonrcavity ] ) simultaneously , by choosing the interaction time @xmath61 : @xmath62 then atom 2 passes through two classical fields tuned to the transitions @xmath59 and @xmath58 respectively by appropriately choosing the amplitudes and phases of the classical fields : @xmath63 with this steps , we will obtain the @xmath21 transformation : @xmath62    in any physical system , single qubit gates are easily performed . to the atoms ,",
    "these single qubit gates can be realized by using rotations @xcite .",
    "we could also realize hadamard gate in cavity qed by considering an atom through an initially empty resonant cavity . in the interaction picture ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xcite : @xmath64.\\ ] ] it s the jaynes - cummings model , where @xmath53 are the creation and annihilation operator of the cavity field .",
    "@xmath65 , with @xmath45 being the ground and excited states of the atom .",
    "the hadamard gate can be realized as follows : at first we send the atom through the initially empty cavity and choose the interaction time @xmath66 , after that we let atom cross the classical field @xmath67@xcite .",
    "the process is : @xmath68 where @xmath67 represents the action of the ramsey zone @xmath69 thus , in cavity qed , not only the @xmath21 operation , but also the hadamard gate has been realized .",
    "now we present the scheme to implement the remote implementation of two - qubit partially unknown quantum operations in cavity qed with three steps , where the logical states @xmath70 and @xmath71 are represented by atom state @xmath47 and @xmath72 , if we use rydberg atoms as the qubits , and the shared two bell pairs are @xmath73 and the unknown state of two qubits is : @xmath74    _ step 1 _ : let atom @xmath22 cross two classical fields tuned to the transitions @xmath58 and @xmath59 given by eq.([classical fields 1 ] ) , respectively .",
    "then , atoms @xmath75 are sent into the nonresonant cavity simultaneously given by eq.([nonrcavity ] ) .",
    "after they pass through the cavity , atom @xmath22 crosses two classical fields tuned to the transitions @xmath59 and @xmath58 shown in eq.([classical fields 2])(@xmath76 ) . at the same time , to the atom @xmath23 and @xmath39 , we operate them by correspondingly replacing @xmath77 with @xmath78(@xmath79 ) .",
    "then measuring two qubits @xmath18 in the basis @xmath80 with the result @xmath81 , and assuming @xmath82 , which means we get @xmath83 , the state of the system becomes @xmath84    _ step 2 _ : with @xmath81 , we do the rotations@xcite on @xmath17 so as to realize @xmath85 and @xmath86 . following , we act @xmath27 on @xmath28 . after doing the rotations on atoms @xmath17 to realize the @xmath87 , two atoms @xmath17",
    "are measured in the basis @xmath88 .",
    "external classical microwave resources resonant on the @xmath89 produce these rotations on the two atoms respectively . the amplitude and phase of these sources are carefully tunned to produce the required transitions . for example , if we want to remotely implement two - qubit partially unknown quantum operation @xmath90 @xmath91 is the corresponding element of @xmath92 .",
    "we assume that measurement outputs of atoms @xmath93 are @xmath94 , which tell us that the atoms are in the state @xmath95 .",
    "after step 2 , we will obtain @xmath96 now let us focus on the recovery operation .",
    "_ step 3 _ : with @xmath94 and @xmath97(which is used to denote decimal system 10 ) , for the atoms @xmath19 , after doing the rotation to realize @xmath98 , we perform them just same as the step 1 by correspondingly substituting @xmath75 with @xmath99(@xmath100 )",
    ". then we do rotations to implement @xmath101 .",
    "thus the system evolves into @xmath102 with the three steps , we can remotely implement the @xmath103 on the atoms @xmath19 .",
    "the simple figure of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig.1 .",
    "is the appropriately chosen classical field to realize the transitions among atomic levels , @xmath104 gates and pauli operations .",
    "@xmath105 is the nonresonant cavity , and the two atoms must be sent into it simultaneously .",
    "@xmath106 is the measurement we do on atom in the basis @xmath107 discussion and conclusion -------------------------    we consider the experimental realization of our protocol . on the one hand , we consider the radiation of the atom . to the @xmath108 operation , if choosing @xmath109 and @xmath110khz @xcite , the interaction time of cavity - field is @xmath111s .",
    "the time needed for the atom tuned with classical field is on the order of @xmath112 @xcite , thus it is negligible at this scale@xcite .",
    "so the time needed to implement the scheme is on the order of @xmath113s , much shorter than the radiative time of the rydberg atom with principal quantum numbers @xmath114 and @xmath115 , which is about @xmath116s .",
    "on the other hand , we consider the cavity decay . with present cavity technology , a cavity with a quality factor",
    "@xmath117 is experimentally achievable@xcite . as discussed in @xcite , the photon lifetime in the cavity whose cavity frequency is about 50 ghz is @xmath118s . in the present protocol ,",
    "that the cavity is always in the vacuum state result in the suppressed cavity decay .",
    "therefore , the cavity has only about 0.01 probability of being excited during the passage of the atoms through the cavity and the efficient decay time of the cavity is about @xmath116s , on the order of the atomic radiative time , which is much longer than the time needed to implement the scheme . in 2001",
    ", an experiment of preparing epr pairs with two atoms using the present model has been implemented@xcite .",
    "to the resonant cavity , which we use it to realize hadamard transformation , the atom acting as the qubit must have a sufficiently long excited life - time .",
    "luckily , the rydberg atom with principal quantum numbers 50 and 51 is a good candidate , because the interaction time ( with the same characters , we have the interaction time @xmath119 ) is much shorter than the atomic radiative time .",
    "hence the time to complete the remote implementation of two - qubit partially unknown quantum operations is much shorter than that of atom radiation .",
    "however , there is still a difficulty to carry out our protocol : distinguishing the two atoms after they flying out of the cavity .",
    "fortunately , we can use the method proposed in@xcite , which has developed a technique to address any specified target ion using tightly focused laser beams and by changing their internal states to  hide \" the remaining ions from the target ion s fluorescence so that they are insensitive to the fluorescent light .",
    "therefore , our scheme is realizable based on current cavity technology .    in order to realize the @xmath21 operation ,",
    "we require the two atoms are sent through a cavity simultaneously .",
    "hence we would like to estimate the influence when the simultaneous is not exactly satisfied , that is we estimate the fidelity between the result that one atom enters the cavity sooner than the other by @xmath120 and the eq.(40 ) through an numerical calculation , and get the fidelity as high as @xmath121 .",
    "the calculation results are showed in fig.2 .",
    "therefore , our protocol are slightly affected .    .",
    "in order to get the numerical results , we have assumed @xmath122 , where @xmath123 resulting from the fact that @xmath124 is a unitary transformation . in the calculation , @xmath125 are all arbitrary positive real numbers and the previous three run their values . we make sure @xmath126 , @xmath127 . ]    in summary , we propose the scheme to remotely implement two - qubit partially unknown quantum operation in cavity qed . in order to do this ,",
    "the recovery operations are constructed by @xmath21 and single - qubit pauli operations , thus all the operations are just @xmath21 , hadamard gate and pauli operations .",
    "we realize them and draw the conclusion that the scheme can be demonstrated in cavity qed . besides , from the eq.(1 )",
    ", the two - qubit partially unknown quantum operations can be constructed in cavity qed because we have realized @xmath31 .",
