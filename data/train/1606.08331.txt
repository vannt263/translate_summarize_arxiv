    "the famous kovalevskaya integrable case of heavy rigid body dynamics in @xmath0 has various nontrivial integrable generalizations .",
    "one of the most interesting ones is the motion of the kovalevskaya gyrostat in one or two constant force fields ( e.g. , gravitational and electric ) described in @xcite .",
    "the systems are hamiltonian on the cotangent bundle @xmath1 and , as was shown in @xcite , their generic invariant manifolds are 3-dimensional tori .    in the present paper",
    "we consider only the cases of the presence of @xmath2-symmetries , which allow reductions to systems with two degrees of freedom with 2-dimensional generic invariant tori .",
    "( the nature of the symmetries will be explained in section 2 . )",
    "this occurs in two situations :    \\1 ) the two fields are orthogonal and the intensities are equal ; + 2 ) there is just one constant force field , the corresponding system is the kovalevskaya gyrostat , which , for zero value of the gyrostatic momentum , becomes the classical kovalevskaya top",
    ".    in @xcite bobenko , reyman and semenov presented a lax representation for both cases and gave their algebraic geometric description .",
    "in particular , it was shown that , after factoring out a trivial involution , the corresponding spectral curve @xmath3 is non - hyperelliptic of genus 3 and is a 2-fold ramified covering of an elliptic curve @xmath4 .",
    "the reduced systems were linearized on 2-dimensional prym variety @xmath5 associated with the covering @xmath6 . in the case of the classical kovalevskaya top the authors of @xcite demonstrated that the generic complex invariant manifolds are open subsets of @xmath7 .",
    "this variety has polarization ( 1,2 ) , so it can not be the jacobian variety of a genus 2 curve which can be used for a separation of variables of the systems .    on the other hand , in her celebrated paper @xcite",
    ", s. kovalevskaya presented a separation of variables on a genus 2 ( and , therefore , a hyperelliptic ) curve @xmath8 , whereas the complex flow of the system was linearized on the jacobian of @xmath8 .",
    "apparently , the papers @xcite were the first ones where this seeming contradiction had been explicitly explained : the subvariety @xmath7 can be viewed as 2-fold covering of the jacobians of 3 different , i.e. , birationally non - equivalent , genus 2 curves .",
    "in addition , there exist 3 other different genus 2 curves whose jacobians are 2-fold coverings of @xmath7 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , for the case of the kovalevskaya top , one of these hyperelliptic curves is birationally equivalent to the original curve of separation @xmath8 .",
    "( these relations between @xmath7 and the jacobians are briefly described in section 3 . )    next , following a remarkable geometric construction of w. barth @xcite inspired by @xcite , the papers @xcite presented a family ( pencil ) @xmath9 , @xmath10 of ( generally non - hyperelliptic ) genus 3 curves covering elliptic curves , and the coverings give rise to one and the same prym variety _ dual _ to @xmath7 arising in the kovalevskaya problem .",
    "it was shown that all the above six genus 2 curves can explicitly be extracted from @xmath9 , either as regularizations of singular curves or as quotients of hyperelliptic curves of @xmath11 .",
    "curiously , the spectral genus 3 curve @xmath3 of @xcite did not appear in this analysis .",
    "the main observation of the present paper is that , in fact , the spectral curve @xmath3 naturally fits into the w. barth construction of pencils of genus 3 curves . using this property",
    ", we show that the kovalevskaya curve @xmath8 can be obtained from @xmath3 by a simple one - step transformation , even without knowing explicitly the family @xmath9 and avoiding complicated calculations .",
    "namely , @xmath8 appears as regularization of the curve _ dual _ to the spectral curve @xmath3 ( see section 3 . )    in the particular case of zero area integral , the curve @xmath3 itself becomes singular of genus 2 , then the above construction implies that @xmath12 must be isogeneous , whereas @xmath13 themselves are related via the richelot transformation .",
    "this property has previously been described in @xcite .",
    "the same main observation allows us to recover easily the curves of separation of variables in all known linearizations of the kovalevskaya gyrostat in one and two fields ( section 4 ) .",
    "we also derive some new separation curves for this problem ( without doing the linearization itself ) .",
    "in this section we reproduce some important known results on the dynamics and complex geometry of the kovalevskaya gyrostat .    using , for convenience , the notation of @xcite , consider the motion of an axisymetric rigid body in @xmath14 with angular velocity vector @xmath15 about a fixed point in presence of constant force fields @xmath16 of different nature ( e.g. , gravitational and electric ) , which are not parallel .",
    "let @xmath17 be position vectors of the mass and , respectively , charge centers of the body .",
    "the equations of motion in the body frame have the form @xmath18 + [ c_1,g ] + [ c_2,h ] , \\\\",
    "\\frac{dg}{dt } = [ g,\\omega ] , \\quad \\frac{dh}{dt } = [ h,\\omega ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the total angular momentum and @xmath20 $ ] denotes the vector product .",
    "assume that the body carries a rotator with a fixed axis , then @xmath21 are related as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the inertia tensor of the body ( with the rotator ) and @xmath24 is related to the corresponding constant gyrostatic momentum .",
    "the phase space of the system is the cotangent bundle @xmath1 , and the components of @xmath25 stand for redundant coordinates on @xmath26 .",
    "equivalently , the phase space can be regarded as dual to the lie algebra @xmath27 , the semi - direct product of @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the corresponding lie  poisson structure .",
    "then the system is hamiltonian with the hamilton function @xmath30 which is the total conserved energy . also , the intensities @xmath31 and the product @xmath32 are trivial integrals of the system .",
    "they are casimir functions of the lie ",
    "poisson bracket of @xmath33 , and fixing generic values of the functions one obtains a 6-dimensional coadjoint orbit in the coalgebra .",
    "assuming now @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ( the axes of symmetry of the body and of the rotator are parallel ) , we obtain the configuration of the _ kovalevskaya gyrostat _ with the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath37    for this case of equations , in @xcite bobenko , reyman , and semenov - tyan - shansky presented a @xmath38 matrix lax representation @xmath39 $ ] with a spectral parameter @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( we do not reproduce @xmath42 here ) with the spectral curve @xmath43 where @xmath44 are laurent polynomials .",
    "apart from the hamiltonian @xmath45 and the trivial integrals , the coefficients of @xmath46 involve two other independent integrals @xmath47 given by expressions ( 1.9 ) , ( 1.10 ) in @xcite , and all of them were shown to commute . as a result ,",
    "the kovalevskaya gyrostat , is completely integrable , and its generic real invariant varieties are 3-dimensional tori .",
    "next , the complex flow of the system was shown to be linear on the jacobian variety of @xmath48 .",
    "the latter has an obvious involution @xmath49 , so it is a 2-fold covering of the quotient curve @xmath50 of maximal genus 4 .",
    "it follows that the jacobian variety of @xmath48 , @xmath51 contains @xmath52 as an abelian subvariety .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the flow is confined to the subtorus @xmath53 .",
    "for this reason , it is sufficient to study only the properties of @xmath3 , which will be called the quotient spectral curve .",

    "the reduced gyrostat in 2 fields possesses two independent commuting integrals , which are reductions of @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 , and is linearized on 2-dimensional invariant tori .    in the sequel we will set @xmath74 ,",
    "then the integrals @xmath75 read @xmath76 where the value of the momentum @xmath77 should be fixed .    from section 5 of @xcite",

    "in the other case of @xmath2-symmetry , the kovalevskaya gyrostat moves only in one constant force field ( one can set @xmath86 ) , and for @xmath87 the system becomes the classical kovalevskaya top .",
    "the @xmath2-action is the rotation about the fixed vector @xmath88 and is generated by the hamiltonian @xmath89 , i.e. , the area integral . upon fixing its value ,",
    "the system admits a hamiltonian reduction onto the cotangent bundle @xmath90 of @xmath91 with two independent commuting integrals and 2-dimensional generic invariant tori .",
    "equivalently , the reduced kovalevskaya gyrostat can be regarded as a hamiltonian system on the coalgebra @xmath92 with the two integrals @xmath93 and the casimir functions @xmath94 .    in the considered case",
    "the quotient spectral curve @xmath3 takes the following concrete form @xmath95 where now @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is obtained from by setting @xmath86 . under the same birational transformation @xmath79 the curve @xmath98 can be written in the form @xmath99 the factor of @xmath98 by the involution @xmath81 is the elliptic curve @xmath100 and again , generally ( also for @xmath101 ) , genus@xmath102 .",

    "equivalently , following @xcite , @xmath105 .    using the approach of vector baker  akhiezer functions , the authors of @xcite linearized the complex flow of the reduced gyrostat in one field on the subvariety @xmath106 and proved that , for @xmath87 and @xmath107 , the generic 2-dimensional complex invariant manifold @xmath108 of the system , the common level surface of the integrals @xmath109 , is an open subset of the prym subvariety",

    ", the product @xmath447 can be regarded as a 4-fold covering of @xmath466 , and vice versa ( if we identify conformally equivalent abelian tori ) . and , as stated in proposition [ jacobi ] , @xmath466 is also a 4-fold covering of @xmath431 .",
    "all the observations lead to the following diagram of coverings of abelian varieties in the case @xmath419 .        according to proposition [ ell_case ] ,",
    "apart from the curves @xmath467 , and @xmath437 there exist three other genus 2 curves : a curve @xmath468 , which is also a 2-fold covering of @xmath239 , and two non - equivalent curves @xmath246 , being such coverings of @xmath247 ( we do not present their equations here ) .",
    "all of them can be used as curves of separation in the considered special case , as their jacobians are isogeneous to the complex invariant torus @xmath115 .",
    "we conclude by summarizing all the curves of this subsection , as well as the relations between them , in the following diagram where the arrows denote reductions to particular cases of motion or coverings , or the richelot transformation , and the symbol @xmath469 indicates non - equivalence .",
    "from the spectral curve of the lax pair of the kovalevskaya gyrostat in one and two fields presented in @xcite we managed to recover all known curves of separation of variables , including the original kovalevskaya curve , and constructed new ones .    naturally , the approach we used does not allow to make an explicit reduction of the systems to quadratures .",
    "however , the obtained separation curves can be used in analysis of bifurcations of complex invariant manifolds of the systems .",
    "next , the approach itself does not permit to reconstruct explicitly the whole pencil of genus 3 curves @xmath283 , which might be used to derive alternative genus 2 curves , whose jacobians are degree 2 isogeneous to @xmath7 , and which are depicted in diagram .    returning to the case of general configuration of the kovalevskaya gyrostat in two fields , when the conditions @xmath376 do not hold , it is natural to conjecture that generic complexified invariant tori of the system are isomorphic to the 3-dimensional prym variety @xmath470 associated with the quotient genus 4 curve @xmath3 in covering an elliptic curve . then an interesting open problem is to describe principally polarized abelian tori isogeneous to @xmath470 as jacobians of genus 3 curves .",
