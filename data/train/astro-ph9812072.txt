    "with the launch of the hst we are now witnessing a new era that allows to analyze in detail nearby objects such as galactic regions or 30 dor in the lmc .",
    "such studies permit to resolve and study individual stars in massive star clusters and obtain uv spectra of hot stars with metallicities that are not solar .",
    "these studies combined with follow up observations from 10-m class telescopes will bring an enormous knowledge about massive star formation and evolution processes and in particular direct informations about the imf slope , as well as its lower and upper mass limits and velocity dispersion of individual star clusters .",
    "however , as one tackles with objects at larger distances , stars will remain unresolved and so any argument will still be based on global properties . in particular in the quest for primeval galaxies at very large redshift one",
    "must be prepared to identify them and a thorough knowledge of the properties of nearby starbursts is indeed mandatory .",
    "for this reason studies of massive star formation in nearby galaxies have received a great attention in the past years . in the uv",
    "the seminal paper of meier & terlevich ( 1981 ) has pointed out the possible resemblance of a primeval galaxy with some local blue compact galaxies that might be forming stars for the first time .",
    "kinney et al . ( 1996 ) compiled a set of templates from the uv to the near infrared for galaxies of different kinds , including starbursts , spirals and ellipticals , aiming to provide a way to properly apply k - corrections for high redshift objects .",
    "very recently , heckman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have presented a systematic study of the uv properties of a sample of 45 starburst and related galaxies , proposing to use them as a `` training set '' to better understand the properties of starbursts at high redshift . in parallel ,",
    "efforts have been put in building various models using population synthesis techniques to reproduce all the observed electromagnetic spectrum from the uv up to x - rays ( see the proceedings of the 1995 iap ( kunth et al .",
    "1996 ) , 1995 crete ( leitherer et al . 1996 ) and 1998 puerto vallarta ( van der hucht et al . 1998 ) conferences for a comparative compilation of synthesis models and observational results ) .    with these ideas in mind we started some years ago the detailed study of massive star formation episodes in different environments .",
    "the predictions of evolutionary populations synthesis models at various metallicities were presented and discussed in arnault , kunth & schild ( 1989 ) , mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991a ) and cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 ) .",
    "we now present a comprehensive observational study of massive star ",
    "formation episodes taking place in star  forming galaxies and giant regions in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "preliminary partial results have been discussed in mas - hesse ( 1990 ) and mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991b , 1996a , b ) .",
    "our analysis is based on the integrated emission from the whole massive star clusters .",
    "the sample comprises a set of galaxies with different morphological types , luminosities and hosting environments .",
    "some of them are close enough to have been recently studied with the hst , allowing comparisons to be made , while others are far more distant and remain suited for integrated studies like the present one or for statistical investigations .",
    "our goal is to characterize what are the universal properties of starbursting episodes : initial mass function ( imf ) , star formation regime ( instantaneous or extended ) , evolutionary state , effects of dust particles , effects on the interstellar medium ( ism ) , etc ... to achieve this , iue uv data have been complemented with optical spectroscopical observations , with special care to match both apertures .",
    "the data set has been completed with ir , far infrared ( fir ) and radio data .",
    "we will show that the comparison of multiwavelength observational data with the predictions of synthesis models is a powerful tool to constrain the properties of these star  forming episodes .",
    "the observational data ( optical , ultraviolet , fir and radio ) are described in sect .",
    "2 ; the predictions of our evolutionary models are presented in sect .",
    "3 ; the model fitting techniques require some subtle handling that critically depends on the quality and completeness of each available data set as exposed in sect .",
    "4 ; the results are given in sect .",
    "5 , together with a complete discussion of the processes that govern fundamental starburst properties ; in sect .  6",
    "we discuss in more detail the properties of some individual galaxies ; our conclusions are finally summarized in sect .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ nancay ]    radio continuum data for the rest of the sample have been taken from the literature .",
    "fluxes at 6  cm are listed in table  [ rfir ] together with the radio spectral index .",
    "we stress again that these radio fluxes generally correspond to the integrated galaxy and not only to the star - forming regions .",
    "our evolutionary population synthesis models have been discussed in detail in arnault et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991a ) and cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 ) .",
    "they are based on the set of stellar evolutionary tracks provided by the geneva group ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 ; schaerer et al .",
    "1993ab ; charbonnel et al . 1993 ) , which have been computed for several metallicities between z=2z@xmath2 and z = z@xmath2 /20 , including overshooting and taking into account the effect of the wr atmospheres on the emitted spectral energy distribution .",
    "our models consider a stochastic imf generated by the monte carlo method with initial masses between 2 and 120 m@xmath2 and a power law dependence on mass @xmath3 .",
    "we have assumed three values for the slope , the salpeter s one , @xmath4 , and two extreme values , @xmath5 .",
    "we have used very short time steps ( @xmath6 0.05  myr ) to account for very rapid stellar phases such as the wr one .",
    "two extreme star formation regimes have been considered : an instantaneous burst ( ib ) and an extended episode ( eb ) at a constant star formation rate .",
    "calculations have been performed for a period of only 20  myr , since we were mainly interested in the evolution of the most massive stars . after this time",
    ", a constant star formation process enters an asymptotic phase in which the population of massive stars ( m@xmath7m@xmath2 ) is nearly constant .",
    "our eb models should not be confused with those assuming constant star formation rates over several gyr , since even at 20 myr stars with masses below around 10  myr have not yet left the main sequence .",
    "the synthesis has been performed in two steps .",
    "we have first synthesized the population of massive stars in a young cluster as a function of age , imf and metallicity .",
    "more precisely , we have calculated the number and luminosity ( per unit solar mass formed ) of stars of each spectral type ( o3 to m5 ) and luminosity class ( i , iii and v ) by mapping the hr diagram as the stars evolve along the evolutionary tracks .",
    "we have then computed a set of observational parameters covering the uv to radio range using a compilation of spectra and fundamental properties of standard stars of each type .",
    "although this compilation is based only on solar metallicity stars , we have selected a set of observational parameters which , in principle , are not seriously affected by the metallicity of the corresponding stars .",
    "our dependence on metallicity is then based solely on its effects on the stellar evolutionary tracks , which originate very different stellar populations at a given time .",
    "we have discussed in mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991a ) the limitations of this approach .",
    "synthesis models based on stellar atmosphere models at different metallicities have been presented in the last years ( garca - vargas et al .",
    "1994 ; schaerer & vacca 1998 ) .",
    "while these models provide a more accurate prediction of the shape of the ionizing continuum ( and are thus better suited to synthesize the emission line spectrum ) , the parameters we have synthesized are not significantly affected . in the following paragraphs",
    "we will discuss briefly our set of parameters and their validity for constraining the properties of the star formation processes :      the number of ionizing photons can be measured from the luminosity of the balmer emission lines and also from the thermal radio emission .",
    "there are essentially two technical problems : first , the extinction affecting the nebular gas in global has to be well determined and corrected . as we will see later",
    ", inhomogeneities in the dust particles distribution can make this task rather complex .",
    "it is also very difficult to account for the number of high energy photons directly absorbed by dust , which do not contribute to the ionization process .",
    "we have assumed as a first approximation that in average 30% of the photons below 912    are directly absorbed , as found in galactic regions by smith et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and mezger ( 1978 ) , but the exact value will depend on each galaxy .",
    "second , it is needed to integrate the emission line fluxes over the whole emitting region .",
    "if such region is ionization bounded and the flux is spatially integrated over the whole emitting region , the complete number of ionizing photons can be estimated .",
    "if this is not the case , a significant fraction of the photons could escape without being accounted for when comparing with models predictions .",
    "as explained above , we have measured @xmath8through a large slit in order to cover essentially the whole ionized regions and minimize these problems .",
    "effective temperatures provide an additional constraint on the mass distribution of stars that dominates the ionizing emission of the cluster .",
    "the effective temperature can not be directly measured but has to be estimated from its effects on several emission lines .",
    "unfortunately , these effects are also very dependent on other properties of the nebular gas ( filling factor , density , metallicity , ... ) , which not always can be well determined .",
    "effective temperature estimates therefore strongly depend on the photoionization scenario ( see vlchez & pagel 1988 and cervio & mas - hesse 1994 )",
    ". the determination of the effective temperature can be in error if spatial integration of the emission flux over the whole region is not performed .",
    "we have computed the spectral energy distribution in the uv , optical , near and far infrared and radio ranges .",
    "each of these energy ranges can be dominated by different stellar populations , so that the comparison of the whole predicted and observed seds is a powerful method to set constraints on the structure of the stellar population . while the uv emission is dominated by young , hot stars , the principal contributors to the near infrared bands are red supergiant stars formed during the burst ( or even nebular continuous emission , depending on the evolutionary state of the burst ) .",
    "the radio continuum is essentially due to thermal emission when the burst is young , but can be dominated by the non - thermal emission of supernova remnants once the most massive stars have ended their lifetime .",
    "the principal problem is the contamination of the observed flux by an underlying population of older stars , unrelated to the present burst .",
    "while this problem is minimal in the uv range , it can seriously affect the optical and near infrared ranges , especially if an important population of red giants is present ( thuan 1983 ) .",
    "we have minimized this effect by selecting objects with very strong uv continuum , expected to be dominated in most wavelengths by the emission from young massive stars .",
    "we will see later that , nevertheless , in some cases the contribution of stars not related to the burst is still significant .",
    "constraints that can be derived from the optical - uv sed are hampered by two facts : first , the uv slope varies very weakly with age during the first 10 myr ( fig .",
    "[ cext]a ) .",
    "second , even low amounts of interstellar dust produce a significant reddening of the uv emission ( fig .",
    "[ cext]b ) .",
    "the energy these dust particles absorb is reradiated thermally in the far infrared range , as computed in mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991a ) .",
    "therefore , by simultaneously analyzing the shape of the uv continuum and the far infrared emission we can estimate the amount of extinction and recover the original sed . as a by - product we derive important information about the shape and strength of the extinction law in these objects , as we will discuss later .",
    "it is thus crucial to build information from a wide wavelength range to properly derive the properties of the stellar population in the young clusters .",
    "an additional problem when comparing the fir and radio luminosities is that both have been generally obtained through very large apertures , covering essentially the whole galaxies .",
    "the comparison is only meaningful in compact galaxies , in which the contribution in these bands is dominated by the star  forming region .      the @xmath91400 and @xmath91550 absorption lines provide a direct evidence for the presence of a massive stellar population .",
    "they frequently show a p  cygni profile , as seen in the uv spectra of individual stars in our galaxy .",
    "their ratio is very sensitive to the spectral type of stars dominating the cluster emission since it varies by more than a factor 10 between o6 and b1 and shows a significant luminosity effect ( sekiguchi & anderson 1987a ; mas - hesse & kunth 1991a ) .",
    "@xmath10 can then provide a first estimate about the dominant stellar population independently on any evolutionary model assumption .",
    "the use of the equivalent width of these lines to derive information about the stellar content of the clusters was first introduced by sekiguchi & anderson ( 1987a+b ) .",
    "mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991a ) and cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 ) have synthesized the @xmath10 ratio as a function of age , imf and metallicity of the star ",
    "forming region .",
    "robert , leitherer and heckman ( 1993 ) have synthesized the whole profiles of the lines for solar metallicity bursts based on a library of high resolution iue spectra .",
    "a major problem is that these equivalent widths strongly depend on the metallicity of the gas from which the stars formed .",
    "profile fitting techniques or even approaches based on the analysis of single lines require the availability of a library matching the metallicity of the object under study . on the other hand",
    ", the ratio of both equivalent widths , @xmath10 , should be essentially independent on metallicity .",
    "we have plotted in figs .",
    "[ wsc]a , b , c the measured @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 versus the nebular oxygen abundance for the objects in our sample .",
    "it can be seen that the upper envelope of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 vs. o / h distributions shows a clear trend toward lower strengths of and absorption lines at low metallicities .",
    "the dispersion below this upper envelope is affected by evolutionary effects , since the lines become weaker when the cluster evolves .",
    "but the trend is weaker or inexistent at all in the case of the @xmath10 ratio , as shown in fig .",
    "leitherer & lamers ( 1991 ) have argued that the @xmath13 ratio could nevertheless be a function of the intrinsic metallicity of the stars .",
    "the effect should be negligible down to z = z@xmath2 /3 , but they predict an increase of the ratio at lower metallicities .",
    "indeed , the line is expected to be a saturated photospheric line and therefore insensitive to z while the line would originate in the wind and therefore decrease with decreasing z. figs .",
    "[ wsc]a , b show that both lines are similarly sensitive to metallicity , contrary to predictions . in fact a clear upper envelope is well defined for both absorption lines , especially for , which is generally stronger .",
    "this envelope defines the relative abundance of carbon and silicon with respect to oxygen in the gas from which the stars formed . a similar correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the nebular oxygen abundance has been found by storchi - bergmann , calzetti & kinney ( 1994 ) in a sample of 44 star - forming galaxies .",
    "as we pointed out in section 2 , both the and absorption lines of photospheric origin can be further contaminated by the additional contribution of interstellar absorptions adding a source of uncertainty in the determination of the @xmath10 ratio . in any case , the calibration of the @xmath10 ratio with spectral types already includes some degree of contamination by the galactic ism .",
    "hst allows to test to which extent the contribution by interstellar lines can dominate the @xmath10 ratio . from the comparison of the ngc  4214 hst spectra with synthetic ones presented by leitherer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we can see that the effect of and interstellar absorptions on the integrated equivalent widths of the p  cygni profiles is small and of the same order ( or weaker ) than the uncertainties induced by noise and by the placement of the continuum .",
    "we have therefore neglected this effect and assumed it is contained within our error bars .",
    "@xmath14 has been recognized for a long time as a very useful parameter to constrain the elapsed time since the onset of a star formation episode ( copetti et al .",
    "1985 ; melnick et al .",
    "1985 ) . since it relates the number of the most massive stars ( @xmath15  m@xmath2 ) to lower mass ones it decreases continuously with time as the most massive stars cease to generate ionizing photons",
    "nevertheless , this age effect can be mixed with those induced by variations in the slope and upper mass limit of the imf .",
    "therefore , it is needed to compare simultaneously different parameters to constrain both the age and the imf .",
    "this can be achieved for example by using the @xmath10 vs. @xmath14 diagrams presented in mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991a ) and updated by cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 ) , as we will discuss later .    while @xmath14 is in principle easy to measure on optical spectra",
    "there are a number of technical problems than can lead to erroneous results .",
    "first of all , @xmath14 has to be measured over the complete region comprising all the stars that contribute to the continuum and also the whole h@xmath1 emitted flux . since the extension of the ionized nebular gas is generally much larger than the region where the continuum is emitted , @xmath14 can easily be underestimated . on the other hand , within a large aperture the contamination of the continuum by older stars might become important . finally , the extinction may affect differently the nebular emission and the stellar continuum hence the determination of @xmath14 .",
    "we will discuss later that in some cases the continuum seems to be significantly less reddened than the emission lines , contrary to the usual assumption that no such correction has to be applied to @xmath14 .",
    "wolf - rayet stars are considered to be highly evolved descendants of the most massive o - stars .",
    "they are extreme population  i stars and have spectra characterized by broad emission lines resulting from dense , high - velocity winds .",
    "these stars are detectable in external galaxies by their prominent emission lines at around 4650 - 4690    ( the `` wolf - rayet bump '' ) .",
    "this bump has been detected in many emission - line galaxies ( allen et al .",
    "1976 ; kunth & sargent 1981 , kunth & schild 1986 ; conti 1991 , conti & vacca 1992 ; schaerer et al .",
    "1999 ) , providing a strong evidence that wr stars are indeed the descendants of massive o - type stars .",
    "arnault et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 ) , meynet ( 1995 ) and schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) have discussed the dependence of the wr bump strength on the parameters that define the star  forming episode ( metallicity , age , imf slope , ... ) .",
    "the two most interesting properties of this feature are its strong dependence on metallicity and the constraints it can impose on the age of the cluster . since the wr phenomenon is tightly coupled to the generation of strong stellar winds , its incidence decreases significantly with metallicity , so that at z  =  z@xmath2 /20 only very massive stars ( initial mass @xmath16 80 m@xmath2 ) might become wr .",
    "this small mass range implies that the detection of the wr bump in low metallicity galaxies can provide excellent on the upper mass limit of the imf .",
    "the relative population of wr over o stars is usually measured through the @xmath17 ratio . to compare with model predictions",
    "it is again necessary to integrate over the whole ionized region .",
    "the observational measurements of this ratio might also be strongly affected by differential extinction .",
    "since @xmath18 is of stellar origin , it should be affected by the same extinction than the stellar continuum . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath8 is of nebular origin and might suffer from a larger amount of extinction .",
    "ignoring this effect may lead to a significant overestimation of the @xmath17 ratio .",
    "finally , recent results by cervio ( 1998 ) show that if a significant fraction of massive stars are formed in binary systems , mass transfers episodes can lead to the formation of wr stars during longer periods of time than predicted by models based on the evolution of single stars alone .",
    "the age calibration through the wr features has to be therefore taken with caution .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that no single observable taken alone can constrain the properties of star forming processes . only by simultaneously fitting several parameters over a large wavelength range tight to different physical processes",
    "can we optimize the unicity of the results . to fit the predictions of the evolutionary synthesis models to the observational data we rely upon the following steps ( additional details on the fitting technique are given in mas - hesse & kunth 1991a ) :    * the diagnostic diagrams @xmath14 vs. @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ whws ] ) provide a first constraint on both the imf slope and the age of the cluster ( cervio & mas - hesse , 1994 ) . since they are metallicity dependent , we have used the o / h nebular abundance as an input value .",
    "although the evolution of instantaneous or extended star formation episodes is significantly different , it is generally not possible to discriminate between both modes from these diagrams alone . for galaxies with no available @xmath10 ratio we assumed a salpeter s imf and used @xmath14 for constraining the age .",
    "* the age has been further constrained by the wolf - rayet bump .",
    "the @xmath17 ratio is sensitive to the star formation regime ( instantaneous or extended ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when available , the radio spectral index has been used to disentangle between instantaneous or extended bursts . as discussed in mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991a ) ,",
    "the number of ionizing photons emitted in a burst in which new massive stars are being continuously formed is so high , that radio emission is always dominated by the thermal contribution from nebular gas , while the non - thermal fraction associated to supernova remnants is almost negligible .",
    "the detection of radio spectral indexes below @xmath19 allows to reject extended star formation episodes .",
    "since the radio emission is integrated over the whole galaxy , this constraint is reliable only for small objects dominated by the starburst , but not for larger galaxies with important disk population .",
    "* we have fitted the uv continuum by models normalized at 3000  .",
    "we have selected 11 bands between 1285 and 3000   chosen to be relatively free from emission or absorption lines to perform the fitting .",
    "when only the 1200 - 1900   iue range was available , 8 points were selected and the normalization was done at 1930  . the fitting has been performed assuming three different extinction laws : galactic ( cardelli et al . 1991 ) , large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( nandy et al . 1981 ) and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( prvot et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the fit is qualified by the @xmath20 parameter , which measures the deviation between the synthetic and the observed averaged continua .",
    "+ after these first three steps of the fitting procedure we ended with a relatively narrow range of valid models , as well as with an optimal extinction law and the corresponding value of the @xmath21 color excess .",
    "* comparing the observed luminosity at 3000 ( 1930 )   with the one predicted by the best models we derived the total amount of gas transformed into gas since the beginning of the burst ( predictions are normalized to 1 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "this mass corresponds to stars within the imf boundaries ( 2 - 120 m@xmath2 and the corresponding slope ) .",
    "once this normalization factor has been derived , we have computed model predictions for absolute parameters , like @xmath22 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath22 , which is a function of the total reddening affecting the intrinsic uv sed , has then been compared to the observational value as a consistency check of the assumed extinction correction .",
    "a final constraint is provided by comparing observed and predicted h@xmath1 luminosities .",
    "when available we have used h@xmath1 luminosities observed through apertures similar to the iue ones . * we have finally compared predicted and observed optical continua ( only for those objects observed through large apertures ) . while in a burst dominated object the contribution to the optical continuum by an older underlying population should be negligible , this contribution can be important in some galaxies . subtracting the predicted from the observed continuum flux",
    "we have estimated this contribution and have corrected the measured @xmath14 value from the contamination by underlying population . with this corrected value of @xmath14",
    "we have iterated again at step i.",
    "we have summarized in table  [ res ] the results of our evolutionary synthesis models applied to 17 star  forming regions .",
    "we list in this table the parameters that provide the best fit , together with their corresponding predicted and measured values .",
    "the mass of gas transformed into stars corresponds in all cases to the whole imf range between 2 and 120 m@xmath2 .",
    "this value does not necessarily correspond to the total amount of gas transformed into stars , since a significant fraction of gas is expected to have formed lower mass stars , not included in our computations . on the other hand ,",
    "if the imf is truncated at upper mass limits lower than 120  m@xmath2 , the total mass involved would be correspondingly lower .",
    "we can see from the table that in general a solution can be found which simultaneously reproduces the whole set of multiwavelength parameters .",
    "nevertheless , as we will discuss later , in some individual cases either the solution is not unique or some of the parameters can not be properly reproduced by the models .",
    "the observational values of @xmath14 and @xmath17 have been corrected from the contribution to the optical continuum of underlying older stars , as well as from differential extinction between continuum and emission lines , es explained below .",

    "while there are strong constraints in few objects toward constant star formation rates during at least 10 - 15  myr , in most cases the formation of massive stars seems to have been essentially coeval , as found in galaxies hosting large numbers of wr stars .",
    "unfortunately , evolutionary synthesis models predict similar values for several parameters 3 - 5  myr after an instantaneous burst and after 20 myr of continuous star formation ( mas - hesse & kunth 1991a ) . for the purposes of this paper we have assumed in these ambiguous cases that the star formation episodes have been nearly instantaneous .",
    "it has been postulated in the past that strong ionizing flux produced by newly formed massive stars could inhibit further formation of stars , explaining why massive stars seem to be coeval in many bursts . on the other hand , we have found that massive stars have been continuously formed during several million years in some galaxies .",
    "hst imaging of izw  18 , for example , has allowed to identify individual clusters with different ages ( hunter & thronson 1995 ) .",
    "the superposition of several of these clusters at different ages would mimic an extended star formation episode when analyzed globally .",
    "therefore , the detection of starbursts forming stars during extended periods of time can still be reconciled with the idea that individual clusters of massive stars are coeval .",
    "the spread in the evolutionary status of the studied starbursts is rather narrow .",
    "their mean age is around 4  myrs , in any case within the range 2.5 - 6.5  myrs .",
    "our sample is obviously biased toward very young bursts , since galaxies have been selected from their strong emission lines .",
    "after some 7  myrs of an instantaneous burst the ionizing flux decreases significantly , so that no strong emission lines would be expected .",
    "older starbursts , at ages above 7  myr , should be detected from their powerful fir emission and large amounts of red supergiant stars .",
    "we have shown indeed in mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991a ) that the fir luminosity decreases with time much slower than the ionizing emission , since it originates mainly from the absorption of uv photons longward of the lyman limit .",
    "this seems to be the case of many iras galaxies with very weak or absent emission lines .",
    "ngc  4945 is a good example of a galaxy in this post - burst phase .",
    "koornneef ( 1993 ) has shown that mass loss from massive red stars and supernovae from red supergiants progenitors dominate its energetics , and has proposed the name post - burst infrared galaxy for objects in this particular evolutionary stage .",
    "we would expect a relatively high number of supernova explosions in these galaxies hence with non - thermal radio emission and spectral indices close to -1.0 .",
    "note that an extended star formation process could not produce in any case such a high firoutput together with the weak emission lines found in these galaxies , since ionizing photons would be produced continuously at a very high rate .",
    "derived ages are in any case model dependent .",
    "the parameterization of @xmath14 as a function of time strongly depends on the number of ionizing photons predicted by stellar atmosphere models as well as on the assumed number of photons directly absorbed by dust .",
    "moreover , if the imf upper mass limit is below @xmath59  m@xmath2 the age determination would become rather imprecise during the first million years , as shown by leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) for starbursts with upper mass limits of only 30  m@xmath2 .",
    "therefore more than the absolute ages we can derive the evolutionary state of the different objects inter - compared with each others .",
    "our models however are weakly sensitive to previous episodes of star formation but rather to the most massive stars formed , hence the ones younger than 10  myr .",
    "previous bursts of star formation would not be detected by our method .",
    "nevertheless , the remnants of such bursts would still provide a significant contribution to the optical continuum .",
    "we believe that this is the case in the few galaxies in which a significant excess of optical emission has been detected ( ngc  4670 , mrk  710 , haro  2 , ngc  4214 , tol  3 and iizw  70 ) .",
    "however the fact that in the majority of these galaxies the observed @xmath60 ratio is rather large rejects the possibility that massive star formation has proceeded at a continuous rate during such a large period of time .      to isolate the effects of the imf slope we have to select observational parameters weakly affected by extinction and well behaved with respect to age ( i.e. , monotonous functions of time ) .",
    "ideal parameters are line equivalent widths , like w(h@xmath1 ) and @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath14 decreases almost continuously with time and is weakly dependent on the imf slope ( mas - hesse & kunth 1991a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath13 ratio increases with time and depends on the imf slope , since it is a good tracer of the relative number of o3-o8 stars versus b0-b3 ones ( see fig .  1 of mas - hesse & kunth 1991a ) .",
    "therefore , combining both parameters it should be possible to constrain simultaneously the age and the imf slope , as we have shown in previous sections .",
    "note that we are only considering the upper section of the imf ( @xmath61m@xmath2 ) , since our method is insensitive to the relative amount of low mass stars ( see mas - hesse & kunth 1991a for a discussion on the effects of low mass stars ) .",
    "we find that the imf slope is constrained to the narrow range 1 to 3 , with a mean value between salpeter one ( @xmath4 ) , and scalo ( 1986 ) ( @xmath62 for the upper section of the imf ) . despite some scatter in the derived values of the imf slope , as shown in figs .",
    "[ whws ] , we find no correlation between the precise value of the slope and other properties of the star formation episodes .",
    "we report however that objects showing flatter imfs are always small , compact star  forming regions , like ngc  588 , mrk  36 and iizw  70 . on the other hand , four of the galaxies ( ngc  4214 , ngc  4670 , ngc  5253 and haro  2 ) with optical continuum more clearly dominated by a previous generation of stars show rather steep imfs with @xmath63 values close to 3 .",
    "the previous bursts of star formation known to have taken place in these galaxies could have modified the properties of the interstellar clouds hampering the formation of lower mass stars .",
    "it is interesting to note that apart @xmath14 and @xmath10 , the rest of the parameters could have been rather well fitted assuming a standard value of the imf slope ( see for instance rosa & benvenuti 1994 ) .",
    "another important result from this work is that we find no correlation between the metallicity and the slope of the imf .",
    "the trend toward flatter imfs at low metallicities proposed in the past ( melnick et al .",
    "1985 ; viallefond 1986 ) is therefore not confirmed by our results .",
    "this trend was proposed to explain the apparent correlation toward higher values of the effective temperature and @xmath14 values at low metallicities .",
    "cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 ) showed that the effects on the evolution of massive stars of decreasing the metallicity could account for this observational trend .",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ whte ] the predicted @xmath14 and effective temperature vs. the o / h abundance at different evolutionary stages of the cluster , assuming nearly instantaneous star formation episodes .",
    "this figure shows a clear trend toward higher @xmath14 and @xmath40 values the lower the metallicity , even with identical imfs .",
    "we can see that at 2.75  myr ( just before the first wr stars have been produced ) , @xmath14 is higher at z  =  z@xmath2 /20 than at z  =  2z@xmath2 by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this effect is even stronger at older ages .",
    "@xmath14 values predicted by evolutionary synthesis models during the first 2  myr can be as high as @xmath64500   , with a fast decrease afterwards .",
    "nevertheless , the observational values of @xmath14 seldom exceed 350    ( see for example the catalogue of galaxies by terlevich et al .",
    "if the imf is complete up to around 120  m@xmath2 , this lack of high @xmath14 objects would indicate that almost no starburst younger than 2  myr has been observed . by an obvious statistical effect",
    ", we would expect to find emission - line galaxies covering more or less uniformly the age range between 0 and 6  myr ( when the emission lines fade ) , so that this discrepancy reflects a weak point of evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "this effect can not be attributed to flatter than normal imfs , since the imf slopes in these regions are similar to that of the solar neighborhood .",
    "the possible contamination of the optical continuum by an underlying stellar population can neither account for this effect .",
    "we have seen that the emission associated to the present burst generally dominates even at optical wavelengths and that the underlying continuum is generally negligible .",
    "moreover , we have been able to correct @xmath14 from the contamination by underlying stars .",
    "the discrepancy could be minimized if the upper mass limit is lowered to around 60  m@xmath2 .",
    "in such a case the maximum values of @xmath14 would remain below around 350    at any time , in accordance with observational results ( mas - hesse & kunth 1991a ) .",
    "nevertheless , stars with initial masses in the range 80 - 100  m@xmath2 ( but not larger ! ) have been found in the magellanic clouds ( massey et al .",
    "1995 ; heydari - malayeri 1996 ) , so that there are no good reasons to truncate the imf at around 60  m@xmath2 ( scalo 1986 , 1990 ) .",
    "bernasconi & maeder ( 1996 ) have proposed recently that , since accretion leading to the formation of massive stars should take around 22.5  myr , stars with initial masses above 40  m@xmath2 would emerge from its parental cloud with a substantial fraction of its central hydrogen content already burned . as a result ,",
    "the formal main sequence lifetime would be reduced and , at the time the star becomes visible , it would have already evolved to lower effective temperatures .",
    "we postulate that this effect could be at the origin of this discrepancy , explaining why no starbursts younger than 2  myr have been identified . nevertheless , to confirm this hypothesis",
    "new models have to be built taken into account the accretion time of the most massive stars .",
    "another possible explanation of this discrepancy could be an overestimation of the lyman continuum photons predicted by the models .",
    "first , the fraction of photons that do not contribute to the ionisation process could have been underestimated .",
    "we have assumed through this work that a fixed fraction of 30% of the photons are directly absorbed by dust .",
    "this value corresponds to the average fraction in galactic regions , as we have discussed above . nevertheless , the compilation by smith et al .",
    "( 1978 ) shows that this parameter covers a range between 80% and 20% in our galaxy .",
    "it is difficult to extrapolate which should be the correct value when analyzing the integrated emission from large star  forming regions in external galaxies , but we want to note that changing the average fraction to 60% , instead of 30% , would reconcile the observations with the model predictions . a second possibility would be the presence of systematic errors in stellar atmosphere models .",
    "as discussed by scalo ( 1990 ) different computations can show a spread of up to an order of magnitude in the number of ionizing photons emitted even at masses as small as 30  m@xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , schaerer et al . (",
    "1995 ) have analyzed the effects of combining stellar structure and atmosphere models on the ionizing flux , treating consistently the entire mass loss from the center out to the stellar winds .",
    "they find that while the shape of the ionizing continuum can be strongly modified with respect to plane - parallel models , the total number of ionizing photons is not significantly modified .    if massive stars formation proceeds as episodic instantaneous bursts , the formation of low mass stars could be seriously hampered .",
    "the time needed for the protostellar collapse of a low mass cloud is at least several million years , in any case longer than the time required for the formation of the most massive stars .",
    "therefore , if we assume that the onset of massive stars inhibits further star formation , low mass could be very deficient in these regions . nevertheless , zinnecker et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have found from x - ray and ir imaging that ob associations contain stars with masses below 1  m@xmath2 , and that 30  dor - like associations may be surrounded by low mass stars .",
    "low mass stars seem therefore to have formed prior to the massive stars , as postulated by tenorio - tagle ( 1994 ) . under this scenario",
    "the whole population of low mass stars would form at the very beginning of the collapse .",
    "shocks induced in the gas by the movement of these stars would trigger the collapse of more massive stars .",
    "these massive stars would finally heat the gas , inhibiting further star formation . in this way",
    ", the whole imf would be filled with stars .",
    "we have plotted in figs .",
    "[ wr]a , b the predicted @xmath17 ratios and @xmath65for different metallicities , two limiting values of the imf slope and both star formation regimes .",
    "we have included in figs .",
    "[ wr]a , b the mean values of the @xmath66 ratios and @xmath65 of a more complete sample of galaxies compiled from kunth & joubert ( 1985 ) , kunth & schild ( 1986 ) and vacca & conti ( 1992 ) ( see also the comparisons made by maeder & meynet 1994 and meynet 1995 ) .",
    "points have been located at their mean ages , as estimated by the @xmath14 values .",
    "error bars indicate the range of ages covered .",
    "nevertheless , these age estimates are only approximate , since no correction at all has been applied to the observational values , generally taken through narrow slits .",
    "it can be seen that our results can be extended to this more complete sample .",
    "the average @xmath14 and @xmath65 values fall fairly well within the limiting predicted curves .",
    "it is also remarkable that the derived range of ages coincide rather well with the ages at which wr stars are expected .",
    "although the lower limits of the error bars would be in some few cases compatible with extended star formation regimes , the average ratios suggest again that the star formation episodes should have taken place almost instantaneously .",
    "the fact that also in this more extended sample the agreement with the @xmath65 values is satisfactory indicates that in these galaxies the burst emission largely dominates in general over the older underlying stellar population .",
    "schaerer ( 1996 ) has evaluated the effect of the evolution of the wr stars population on the narrow emission line at 4686   , by combining model atmospheres accounting for stellar winds with evolutionary tracks .",
    "he concludes that for metallicities in the range z = z@xmath2 /5  z@xmath2 a strong nebular emission line should originate in early wr phases when wc stars begin to appear .",
    "the emission line is indeed detected in few objects with very young ages , below 3  myr , and therefore starting to produce wr stars ( ngc  2363 and mrk  36 ) , in good agreement with the scenario proposed by schaerer .",
    "the relatively large number of massive stars in these small regions originate frequent supernova explosions after the first 3  myr , when the most massive stars ( initial mass around 120  m@xmath2 ) end their lifetime .",
    "the evolution of the supernova rate depends strongly on the imf slope , as discussed in cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 ) . for slopes between @xmath67 and 3",
    "the supernova rate varies only weakly with time . around @xmath68 yr@xmath30 m@xmath2@xmath30 supernovae explosions",
    "are expected with an increasing supernovae rate the higher the metallicity .",
    "considering the mass involved in the star  forming episodes ,",
    "we expect supernova rates in the range @xmath69 ( ngc  588 ) to @xmath70 yr@xmath30 ( haro  2 ) . typical values for compact galaxies are around 1 supernova each 1000 years and remains almost constant after the first 3  myr , up to around 50  myr , when stars of initial mass around 6  m@xmath2 end their lifetime .",
    "therefore , thousands of supernova explosions must have taken place within the relatively small star  forming regions of the most evolved objects we have studied .",
    "the large number of supernova remnants ( snr ) must become strong sources of non - thermal radio emission . depending on the evolutionary state of the star formation",

    "the radio spectral indices are indeed above @xmath56  =  -0.3 ( except for mrk  59 ) , as predicted by the models .",
    "the radio emission in izw  18 , an object having experienced apparently a sequence of bursts during the last 13  myrs , is also purely thermal , showing that the contribution of non - thermal sources becomes negligible when a large number of ionizing stars are present .",
    "the thermal radio emission is a known function of the number of ionizing photons emitted . since our models",
    "are matched to reproduce the intensity of the balmer lines , which are also a linear function of the number of ionizing photons , there should be a good agreement between the observed and predicted thermal radio emissions , but this is not the case .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed balmer lines emission and the thermal radio luminosity is a well - known problem ( israel & kennicutt 1980 ; lequeux et al .",
    "1981 ; caplan & deharveng 1986 ; skillman & israel 1988 ) .",
    "the most accepted explanation is that the effective reddening in the radio range is smaller than in the optical , due essentially to geometrical effects and a patchy distribution of dust .",
    "nevertheless , since the massive stellar population we derive reproduces well the de - reddened balmer line fluxes ( within less than a factor 1.6 in average ) , the intrinsic total number of ionizing photons injected to the nebular gas should be well constrained . a possible explanation for this discrepancy would be the presence of a large number of ionizing stars in small regions completely obscured by dust in the optical , from which only the associated radio emission could escape ( and partially also the near infrared emission lines ) .",
    "this scenario is nevertheless not consistent with our results , since the large number of hidden stars we would need to reproduce the observed radio emission would increase significantly the observed firluminosities contrary to what we observe ( see next section ) .",
    "inhomogeneous scattering , depending on the specific geometrical distribution of dust in each galaxy and with different efficiencies at radio and optical ranges , might provide the additional contribution to the observed radio emission ( caplan & deharveng , 1986 ) .",
    "if this explanation is valid , a word of caution should be given against deriving intrinsic extinctions from the observed ratio between radio and balmer lines emission , since the reddening can be significantly overestimated .",
    "for larger galaxies the underestimation of the radio emission is even more severe , between a factor 10 for haro  2 and two orders of magnitude for mrk  710 .",
    "these discrepancies can be partly attributed to aperture mismatch , especially important in these large galaxies , as well as to the expected contribution of supernova remnants from previous episodes of star formation . as we have discussed above",
    ", supernovae events can be active until more than 50  myr , when the stellar contribution to the uv continuum and to the ionisation process has become negligible . in this sense",
    "it is interesting to note that the three galaxies for which the discrepancy is larger ( haro  2 , ngc  4214 and mrk  710 ) show radio spectral indices below @xmath56 = -0.4 , i.e. dominated by non - thermal sources .",
    "the far infrared emission in objects dominated by intense star formation episodes is essentially due to thermal emission by dust particles heated by the uv stellar radiation field .",
    "this process of absorbing high energy photons , re - emitted at low energies ( typically at around 100  @xmath73 m ) , can be so efficient that the fir luminosity becomes a good approximation to the bolometric luminosity . since the origin of this fir emission is mainly the energy output of massive stars , whose uv photons",
    "are efficiently absorbed by dust , @xmath22 has been used in the past to derive the number of massive stars in the young clusters , and henceforth the star formation rate ( hunter et al .",
    "1986 ) .",

    "as we have explained in detail in mas - hesse & kunth ( 1991a ) we compute the total energy absorbed by dust from the difference between the unreddened synthetic sed and the reddened sed that best fits the observed spectrum .",
    "we take into account the energy provided by lyman @xmath63 photons which are absorbed by dust and a fixed fraction of 30% of the lyman continuum photons which are absorbed by dust and do not contribute to ionisation .",
    "calzetti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have estimated the expected contribution to the fir emission of a large sample of star - forming galaxies by assuming a single extinction law ( calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ) and a color excess derived from the balmer decrement , decreased by 0.5 mag . while this approach might be useful to derive average properties of a large sample , our procedure derives first both the shape and the strength of the extinction law affecting the continuum , and uses these results to compute the expected fir luminosities .",
    "these authors separate the fir emission coming from cool ( @xmath74 around 20 k ) and warm ( @xmath74 around 40  k ) dust , as also proposed by buat & deharveng ( 1988 ) . in our sample star formation processes",
    "are so intense that the fir emission is dominated by the warm dust .",
    "the mean dust temperature is around 40  k , as shown in table  [ rfir ] , so that a two - components deconvolution is not needed .",
    "furthermore , the emission in the iras bands below 60  @xmath73 m is generally very low and has not been detected , so that the extrapolation to the whole fir emission based on the 60 and 100  @xmath73 m fluxes can be taken as a good estimation of @xmath22 .",

    "the discrepancy is highest for ngc  4214 , in which there are known sites of massive star formation outside the iue aperture ( maz - apellniz et al .",
    "1998 ) . as we have discussed in the previous section",
    ", the good agreement between predictions and observations , especially for spatially compact objects , indicates that we are sampling the whole population of massive stars , even at uv wavelengths ( the measured uv continuum is used for de - normalization ) , and that the contribution from stars hidden within dust clouds is negligible .",
    "the only exceptions are ngc  595 and ngc  3256 , a very dusty galaxy , in which only a small fraction of massive stars contribute to the uv continuum while the majority of the newly formed stars are apparently completely obscured by dust .",

    "( 1995 ) have also found that an average of 30% of massive stars might be embedded in dusty regions within dusty galaxies , where @xmath21 @xmath16 0.25 .",
    "our sample is biased towards low reddening galaxies with strong uv continuum with the exception of ngc  3256 , selected by its strong fir emission and showing by far the strongest extinction .",
    "nevertheless , as we have discussed above , even a small amount of dust can significantly modify the strength and shape of the uv continua .    from our analysis",
    "it becomes evident that the dust absorption feature at around 2175    is very weak in these galaxies or even inexistent .",
    "relatively weak absorption bumps in starburst spectra have already been noted by several authors ( blitz et al .",
    "1981 ; lequeux et al . 1981 ; rosa et al . 1984 ; kinney et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the weakness of this absorption feature induced us to include both the lmc and smc extinction laws in our fitting procedure .",
    "it is important to note that these laws have a rather different shape in the uv than the standard galactic one , apart from a weaker ( lmc ) or inexistent ( smc ) absorption feature .",
    "therefore , even when only the 1200 - 1950 iue range is available it is possible to discriminate which of the laws is applicable .",
    "the method we have followed is very sensitive to both the shape of the law and its strength , discriminating between different laws for color excesses above @xmath21 =  0.05 , with @xmath21 being determined at a precision of @xmath76 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ red ] , where we have plotted the best fit obtained assuming three different extinction laws .    in almost all cases",
    "interstellar extinction closely follows either an lmc or smc - like law . since there is a tendency to have weaker absorption features at 2175    at lower metallicities in nearby galaxies ( galaxy - lmc - smc ) we would expect a similar trend in our sample",
    "this is not the case since even near - solar metallicity galaxies like mrk  710 and ngc  3256 are best fitted assuming an lmc extinction law and not a galactic one . the only object in our sample clearly affected by a galactic - like extinction is ngc  595 .",
    "calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have derived an universal uv to optical extinction law from the sed of 39 starburst and blue compact galaxies .",
    "this law and the galactic one show similar optical - far uv slopes , but the calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) one is essentially featureless .",
    "we stress here that the observed uv to optical seds can be very well reproduced by reddening the corresponding synthetic spectra with one of three extinction laws ( galactic , lmc and smc ) with no need to invoke an additional universal law .",
    "the weakness of the absorption bump at 2175    seems to be related to the intense star - formation processes taking place in these objects , rather than to the metallicity .",
    "the strong flux of high energy photons around the young massive clusters and the relatively high temperature that dust particles can reach in these environments affect most probably the size and composition of dust grains . comparing the shape of the galactic , lmc and smc extinction laws with the absorption cross sections by amorphous silicates and graphite grains given by mezger , mathis & panagia ( 1982 ) we conclude that graphite grains are deficient in starburst regions .",
    "an interstellar medium dominated by amorphous silicates would explain naturally both the weakness of the 2175    bump and the steepness of the extinction law .",
    "puget & lger ( 1989 ) attribute the uv absorption bump to carbonaceous very small particles containing polycyclic aromatic molecules .",
    "they describe how a combination of photothermodissociation , double ionization and coulomb explosion processes induced by an intense and hard uv radiation field would decrease significantly the abundance of these particles .",
    "we suspect that these processes do not depend on the metallicity of the environment , but on the intensity of the uv emission , explaining the lack of correlation between the shape of the extinction law and the nebular metal abundance .",
    "we have found that for several galaxies the @xmath21 values derived from the balmer line ratios are systematically higher than values derived from the uv continuum ( see table  [ res ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be clearly appreciated in fig .",
    "[ uvo ] , where we have plotted both @xmath21determinations .",
    "a similar effect has already been noticed by fanelli et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , keel ( 1993 ) and calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in the spectra of starburst galaxies .",
    "it is important to remark that his uv - optical discrepancy is related to two very different sources of emission : stellar continuum and nebular emission lines .",
    "two possible explanations for this discrepancy are the presence of strong absorption lines of stellar origin and geometrical effects .",
    "the usual correction for the contamination by stellar lines assumes absorption equivalent widths of around 1 - 2    and iterates until the color excesses derived from the @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ratios converge to the same value ( mccall , ribsky & shields 1985 ) .",
    "this is the method we have followed to derive the @xmath21 values , but it does not solve the discrepancy . on the other hand , from the synthesis of the balmer lines absorption profiles , daz ( 1988 ) and olofsson ( 1995 ) proposed that the stellar equivalent widths should be much larger , up to around 5   .",
    "we have therefore forced the @xmath21 value to be the same as obtained from uv continuum fits , and have derived so the corresponding equivalent widths of the absorption lines . in some cases",
    "the method converged , yielding consistent values of the absorption equivalent widths between 4 and 5  for the three balmer lines h@xmath1 , h@xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "but for the majority of the objects the equivalent widths did not match the relative strengths predicted by daz ( 1988 ) .",
    "the underlying stellar population seems to be responsible for this discrepancy in the case of haro  2 , at least partially .",
    "the method converged well , deriving stellar equivalent widths of 5.1 , 4.2 and 4.1   for h@xmath1 , h@xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively . assuming this correction , the derived @xmath21 coincides with the value estimated from the uv continuum fits .",
    "moreover , we have recently got high dispersion optical spectra of this galaxy and have been able to measure the equivalent widths of the stellar absorption lines ( legrand et al .",
    "1997a ) , obtaining values in good agreement with the predicted correction ( @xmath82  ; @xmath83  ) .",
    "we conclude that in some galaxies , the discrepancy between the strength of the extinction derived from the continuum and from the balmer decrement can be attributed to the presence of strong stellar absorption lines , associated to an underlying population of relatively low mass stars .    in ngc  4214 , on the other hand",
    ", the required equivalent widths derived by this method varied between 13 and 6    for the different lines . since such a large range of equivalent widths is not expected for the stellar absorption lines , we attribute the discrepancy to geometrical effects related to the inhomogeneous distribution of dust . while the continuum flux comes from the young clusters , the nebular emission originates in much more extended regions well beyond the ionizing sources .",
    "the strong ionizing flux is expected to affect the dust particles properties in the close surroundings of the massive stars .",
    "stellar winds and supernova explosions might wipe out the dust from the neighbourhood of the massive clusters and concentrate it in filaments and dust patches still located within the ionized region . depending on the specific geometrical distribution of dust and stars",
    ", the extinction could affect mainly the nebular gas emission but only weakly the stellar continuum .    in the specific case of ngc  4214 , as we will discuss later , maz - apellniz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found that the balmer line emission peaks at few arcseconds away from the massive stars cluster .",
    "moreover , the reddening is highest in regions where balmer lines are emitted while it is relatively low in front of the star cluster .",
    "the reddening in front of the cluster is consistent with that derived from continuum fits , while the reddening derived integrating spatially over the whole ionized region is significantly higher .",
    "these results have shown that an inhomogeneous distribution of dust can explain indeed the different extinctions derived from the stellar continua and the balmer decrement . nevertheless , this effect is not universal and depends strongly on the distribution of stars , gas and dust in each star  forming region . in the second brightest knot of star formation in ngc  4214 for example , the distributions of stars , ionized gas and dust",
    "are all centered in essentially the same regions .",
    "our results are in good agreement with gordon , calzetti & witt ( 1997 ) , who also conclude from the analysis of the extinction in 30 starbursts that the stars / dust geometry should be close to a dust - free sphere of stars surrounded by an outer star - free shell of clumpy dust .",
    "we want to remark that since our method yields the extinction affecting the stellar continuum only , it might be well that the dust particles producing the uv bump have been destroyed from the neighbourhood of the massive stars , but they could still be present in the ionized gas located far away from the massive clusters .",
    "we have found a trend toward higher @xmath84 values the older the star - forming episode , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ebvt1 ] .",
    "there is a well defined lower envelope , rising with age . on the other hand , note",
    "that the trend is very weak or even inexistent if we compare @xmath85 with the age of the cluster ( see table  [ res ] ) .",
    "similarly , although no clear trend with metallicity is found , the @xmath84 discrepancy becomes highest for galaxies with o / h abundances above 8.4 , i.e. , objects whose interstellar medium has already been polluted by previous star formation episodes ( see fig .",
    "[ ebvt2 ] ) .",
    "we interpret these results as an evidence for an interstellar medium enrichment with dust during the evolution od the clusters .",
    "this fraction of the extinction which is raising with time could be due to newly formed dust grains formed in stellar winds and in the supernova ejecta . in both cases dust",
    "would have been blown away from the stellar cluster , concentrating on given regions , still within the ionized nebula , but at a certain distance from the massive stars . in this way",
    "it would have a stronger effect on the emission lines than on the stellar continuum .",
    "the discrepancy discussed hereabove has important implications on the analysis of starburst regions .",
    "first of all , the h@xmath1 equivalent width , which is used as an age indicator can be affected by this differential reddening .",
    "a difference of @xmath86 between nebular and continuum extinction implies an underestimation in the value of @xmath14 by a factor of 2 .",
    "such discrepancies are not rare , as shown by calzetti et al .",
    "they can lead to an overestimation of the age in some star  forming regions .",
    "a similar effect occurs when measuring the @xmath17ratio , since the wr bump originates in the atmosphere of these stars and should therefore be affected by the same extinction than the stellar continuum .",
    "unfortunately , the only way to correct properly for this effect requires the mapping of the distribution of stars , gas and dust , something which is feasible only for nearby galaxies .",
    "we discuss in the next paragraphs the results we have derived for some representative individual objects .",
    "ngc  5471 is a massive g region located in m101 .",
    "our analysis yields a scenario characterized by a young ( around 3.0  myr ) , massive ( 1.2@xmath87  m@xmath2 ) cluster , following a standard imf ( slope slightly higher than the salpeter value ) .",
    "our age determination coincides with the value derived by rosa & benvenuti ( 1994 ) from hst fos data , also based on the comparison with evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "ngc  5471 seems to be dominated by a well defined burst of star formation with a negligible contribution from older underlying stars .",
    "all the observational parameters can be reproduced by our models and only the radio emission is underestimated , as for the majority of the objects .",
    "the effective temperature is high and hints toward the presence of stars more massive than at least 40  m@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the known existence of wr stars in this object of relatively low metallicity ( o / h around 8.0 ) indicates that the imf upper mass limit has to be very close to at least 100  m@xmath2 , since only stars more massive than around 80  m@xmath2can become wr at this metallicity .",
    "reddening in ngc  5471 is moderate , with a derived color excess @xmath21 = 0.07 . at this low",
    "reddening it becomes difficult to disentangle between the various extinction laws , but the galactic one provides the best fit .",
    "this color excess derived from fitting the continuum is significantly smaller than the value derived from the balmer line ratio by rosa & benvenuti ( 1994 ) , @xmath21 = 0.15 . the good agreement between the predicted and the observed uv continua , as well as the fir luminosities , let us conclude that the continuum can not be reddened by more than @xmath21 = 0.07 .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the good agreement of our 1200 - 7000    synthetic spectrum with the complete hst fos spectrum of rosa & benvenuti ( 1994 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] , the fit is indeed rather good in the whole range , except for an overestimation of the continuum between 3700 and 4900   .",

    "their models favour an extended star formation process active at least during the last 10 - 20 myr , instead of a very young instantaneous episode .",
    "martin ( 1996 ) has found an expanding shell of ionized gas around the massive stellar cluster . from the kinematics of this shell and from the analysis of chemical evolution models",
    "she concluded that massive stars have been forming continuously in izw18 during the last 13 myr .",
    "finally , hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) have identified individual stars in izw  18 with wfpc-2 on the hubble space telescope .",
    "the picture emerging from their results is one in which star formation began some tens of myr ago , especially in the central and northern part of the galaxy .",
    "star formation should have continued since then throughout the rest of the galaxy in smaller star  forming events , giving rise to two main concentrations of massive stars , comprising around half of them , together with other stars scattered throughout the galaxy .",
    "the age estimated for the inner h@xmath63 filaments span between 1 and around 10  myr .",
    "an additional outer filament could be several tens of myr old and is probably related to the onset of star formation in izw  18 .",
    "our models can reproduce the majority of the observational parameters either by assuming an instantaneous burst 3.0 myr old , in agreement with lequeux et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , or an extended star formation process with a constant sfr during the last 13 myr . considering the additional constraints imposed by the chemical evolution models and hst imaging , we have considered only the extended burst scenario .",
    "the onset of relatively small star formation events throughout the galaxy at a nearly constant rate would indeed mimic a continuous star formation process if analyzed globally , as we do through the large iue aperture .",
    "the low metallicity of this object does not allow to measure the individual and lines of stellar origin , so that we can not constrain in any way the imf slope .",
    "we have hence assumed a standard salpeter imf in our analysis .    both the continuum and the emission lines are weakly reddened , with @xmath21around 0.05 in both cases . although at such low reddening our sensitivity to the shape of the extinction law is small ,",
    "the best fit is obtained assuming the galactic law ( @xmath20 = 0.06-gal , 0.10-lmc , 0.12-smc ) .",
    "we wonder therefore whether this reddening could be due to residual galactic extinction , not completely corrected by the burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) method .",
    "the predicted fir emission is very close to the limit of detectability of iras , explaining so its non - detection by this satellite . the predicted radio spectral index , mainly thermal , coincides well with the observational one ( although the radio emission is underestimated by an order of magnitude ) .",
    "the synthetic h@xmath1 emission is also consistent with the value we measured and is essentially identical to the one derived from the hst observations by hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] that the synthetic continuum reproduces well both the observed uv and optical ranges , up to 7000   .",
    "there is no significant excess continuum in the optical as in other galaxies .",
    "we therefore conclude that the present burst of star formation is dominating the emission over the whole uv - optical range , and that the continuum associated to an underlying population if any is negligible .",
    "the contribution from stars formed in a prior burst several tens of myr ago , as postulated by hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) , should therefore be very small ( compared to the emission from the present burst ) , even in the optical range .",
    "our conclusion is that while the h@xmath63 filaments show that star formation could have begun in izw  18 several tens of myr ago , the global star formation rate should have increased significantly around 13  myr ago , and has been maintained essentially constant since then .",
    "our models predict a very small number of wr stars in izw  18 , with @xmath60@xmath57 3  10@xmath93 .",
    "legrand et al . ( 1997b ) and izotov et al . ( 1997 ) detected a small population of wr stars in this galaxy . while both groups agree that the optical bumps are due to at least some wc stars , the presence of wn ones is more controversial .",
    "our models do not predict the presence of wc stars at such low metallicities , unless the formation of wr stars in binary systems is considered .",
    "cervio ( 1998 ) shows that even for a small fraction of stars evolving in binary systems , mass transfer allows the formation of wrs ( mainly of wc type ) at ages above around 6  myr , in good agreement with our age estimates . on the other hand , models assuming enhanced mass loss also predict the formation of a small number of wc stars at very low metallicities ( schaerer & vacca 1998 ) , within a short time period of 1  myr peaking at an age of 3  myr",
    ". these predictions would be in agreement with the observations only if these stars have been formed within one of the very young clusters in izw  18 .",
    "a precise location of these stars would be required to disentangle which effect is dominating in this case : the formation of wrs via the binary channel , or enhanced mass loss rates ( or both together ! ) .",
    "up to now , there is only a marginal detection with hst of 2 possible wr candidates by hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) , and some evidences compatible with 59 wnl stars and/or compact nebular emission by de mello et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "evolutionary models also predict a small number of red supergiant stars ( rsg ) at the metallicity of izw  18 , and indeed some individual k and m rsgs have been identified by hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) .",
    "cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 ) explained how current stellar evolutionary tracks predict smaller populations of rsgs the lower the metal abundance .",
    "the relatively blue @xmath0 value measured by thuan ( 1983 ) through a circular aperture 8@xmath94 in diameter ( @xmath0 = 0.57@xmath950.23 ) is well reproduced by our models ( @xmath0 @xmath57 0.5@xmath950.1 for an extended burst between 10 and 20 myr old ) , thus supporting the predictions of current stellar tracks .",
    "haro  2 is one of the brightest blue compact galaxy in our sample . at a distance of 20.2",

    "in the optical spectrum strong stellar absorption wings are also clearly visible around the balmer emission lines .",
    "recently , lequeux et al . ( 1995 ) and legrand et al . (",
    "1997a ) have found evidences of a strong outflow of gas having been ejected from the starburst region at velocities close to 200 km / s , around 1  myr ago .",
    "fanelli et al .",
    "( 1988 ) have analyzed the uv spectrum of haro  2 using optimized , non - evolutionary , stellar synthesis techniques .",
    "these authors derived a strongly discontinuous luminosity function for this galaxy , with an important contribution to the uv emission of main sequence stars in the ranges o3 - 6 ( 46% at 1500   ) and b1 - 2 ( 48% ) , as well as a marginal contribution from a0 - 2 stars ( 6% ) .",
    "the interstellar reddening affecting the uv continuum derived by this technique corresponds to @xmath21 = 0.15 ( assuming a galactic - like extinction law ) .",
    "the strong contribution of the o3 - 6 group reveals the presence of an important population of young massive stars ( less than 5  myr old ) . from the discontinuities in the derived luminosity functions they concluded that the present burst of star formation has been preceded by at least two bursts , the most recent of which ended not more than 20 myr ago giving an important contribution of b1-b2 stars .",
    "our analysis , based on evolutionary synthesis techniques , yields an age of 4.5  myr for the present burst , with best fits obtained for a rather steep imf ( @xmath96 ) and a nearly instantaneous star - formation episode .",
    "our fitting procedure yields an extinction law similar to the lmc one , with @xmath21 =  0.12 .",
    "both galactic and smc laws are excluded , with @xmath20 parameters above 0.14 , compared to @xmath20 = 0.06 for the lmc law .",
    "the age and extinction strength we derive are consistent with fanelli et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for the present burst .",
    "nevertheless , our models naturally predict an important contribution to the uv continuum of stars with spectral types cooler than o6 , with no need to invoke a discontinuous luminosity function .",
    "the discontinuity in the luminosity function found by the optimizing synthesis technique could be a consequence of adopting a galactic - like extinction law , which we found unable to reproduce the observations in haro  2 .",
    "on the other hand , our models clearly underestimate the optical continuum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] .",
    "it seems that the stars formed in the present burst , the only ones to which our uv observables are sensitive , account for no more than 60% of the total optical emission .",
    "the shape of the optical continuum seems to be dominated by a stars which must have been formed in a previous much older burst .",
    "our models correctly reproduce several other independent observables of haro  2 .",
    "we predict a relative population of wr stars @xmath60 = 0.04 , which can account for the observed wr features .",
    "the fir emission is also well explained supporting the extinction value we have derived from our uv fitting procedure .",
    "the excess fir emission is probably associated to the underlying stellar population , which , as we have shown , is significant in this galaxy .",
    "the total h@xmath1 emission is also satisfactorily reproduced within a factor 1.3 , as well as the relatively low effective temperature .",
    "the @xmath60 and @xmath40 values derived for this galaxy set indeed strong constraints against an extended star formation episode .",
    "our results are also consistent with the detection of outflowing gas cited above . as discussed by lequeux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the gas should have been ejected from the central part of the galaxy around 1  myr ago .",
    "this is consistent with a relatively evolved , massive starburst , which begins to ignite supernovae after the first 3.5  myr of evolution ( assuming @xmath97 @xmath57 120  m@xmath2 ) . since the mass transformed into stars in haro  2 is rather high ( more than 6  10@xmath92 m@xmath2 ) , the estimated number of supernova explosions in the first 10@xmath92 yr after the most massive stars have exhausted their nuclear fuel has to be as high as 500 - 1000 .",
    "the kinetic energy ejected by so many supernovae is large enough to power the outflowing wind .",
    "moreover , such a strong release of energy could have blown away much of the gas left in the core of this galaxy , explaining the non - detection by lequeux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) of any neutral gas at the redshift of the starburst .",
    "mrk  710 is the only large spiral galaxy with a starburst nucleus in our sample .",
    "it is furthermore one of the two objects with a metallicity as high as solar , to be compared with the properties of star - formation processes in metal - deficient blue compact galaxies .",
    "mrk  710 is known to host an important population of more than 15000 wr stars ( kunth & schild 1986 , vacca & conti 1992 ) .",
    "as expected for a starburst located within the bulge of a large galaxy , the relative contribution of the underlying population is very important .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] that around 60% of the observed optical continuum emission is associated to this older population , whose contribution to the uv below 2000    is negligible .",
    "the measured @xmath14 value has therefore to be corrected by a factor of 2.5 , in order to derive the value intrinsically associated to the present starburst .",
    "an additional correction for differential extinction was also applied , yielding a final @xmath14 value almost a factor of 3 higher than the observed one .",
    "the observational parameters of mrk  710 can be in general well reproduced by an instantaneous episode of star formation , around 3.5  myr old , with an imf somewhat flatter than salpeter one .",
    "the predicted wr stars population , with @xmath60 = 0.06 , reproduces well the observed wr features .",
    "the large @xmath17 ratio is indeed consistent with the prediction for solar metallicity stars .",
    "it can not be reproduced by extended star formation models and constrains the episode to have been essentially instantaneous . on the other hand , the effective temperature derived from the optical emission lines",
    "is clearly underestimated by the models .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy could be the presence of some wr stars with effective temperatures higher than those predicted by current evolutionary tracks .",
    "there are indeed observational evidences that some wr stars can reach @xmath40 values above 10@xmath98  k. if some of them are present , they could dominate the shape of the integrated ionizing continuum . on the other hand",
    ", the detection of the oi  @xmath96300    line in this galaxy indicates that shocks are affecting the ionization process so that the @xmath40 values derived assuming pure photoionization might be overestimated . due to its high metallicity , mrk  710 shows also the strongest and absorption lines in our sample , supporting the correlation between the equivalent widths of these lines and the nebular metal abundance we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ wsc ] .    despite the close to solar metallicity of this galaxy ,",
    "the extinction affecting the uv continuum differs significantly from the galactic extinction law .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ red ] the synthetic continuum optimally reddened by using three possible laws .",
    "it can be seen that reasonable fits are achieved only by using the lmc or smc laws , with the best fit obtained with the lmc one for @xmath21 = 0.17 .",
    "the galactic law is completely excluded .",
    "the fir luminosity is underestimated by 30% , as expected in this galaxy where the iras data are integrated over a much larger region than the iue flux , and include the whole nucleus and the spiral arms .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the observed fir luminosity is within a factor 1.3 of the predicted one indicates that the starburst in the nucleus of this galaxy is the most powerful source of energy dominating over other possible individual star formation episodes in the spiral arms .",
    "the mass of gas transformed into stars is close to 10@xmath92  m@xmath2 .",
    "while this amount of mass is clearly higher than in giant regions in spiral arms , it is similar to the values derived in some blue compact galaxies .",
    "we conclude therefore that there are no significant differences between the bursts observed in relatively small , metal deficient , structureless galaxies , like bcgs , and the episodes taking place in the nuclei of large metal - rich spiral galaxies such as mrk  710 .",
    "ngc  3256 has been classified as the remnant of two colliding galaxies , on the basis of its tidal tails and highly chaotic nuclear region ( graham et al .",
    "joseph & wright ( 1985 ) concluded that such a merger would produce a burst of star formation of exceptional intensity , what they called a `` super starburst '' .",
    "the detection of strong and absorption lines by joseph et al .",
    "( 1986 ) is clearly indicative of the presence of massive stars .",
    "moorwood & oliva ( 1994 ) have mapped the spatial distribution of several near infrared lines , finding that br@xmath80 is extended over a 26@xmath99 region .",
    "doyon , joseph & wright ( 1994 ) have detected a large number of red supergiants in the central part of the galaxy , constraining the age of the starburst to between 12 and 27 myr , assuming continuous star formation episodes with different decaying star formation rates .",
    "we included this galaxy in our sample for comparison to analyze the properties of a very intense episode of star formation in a dusty medium and induced by a merging process .    the uv continuum and @xmath14 value",
    "are best reproduced by a rather evolved cluster around 5  myr old , in a very dusty environment ( @xmath21 = 0.16 for an smc law ) and with an imf slope close to salpeter one .",
    "the derived amount of gas transformed into stars is indeed very large , m @xmath16 10@xmath100 m@xmath2 and the measured extinction is significantly larger than in normal blue compact galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note that in mrk  710 and ngc  3256 , the two galaxies with higher metalllicity and the more affected by reddening in our sample , the extinction seems to follow lmc or smc laws characterized by a weak bump at 2175   , supporting our conclusion that there is no correlation between metallicity and the shape of the extinction law .",
    "while our models correctly reproduce the observed uv continuum , they significantly underestimate the total fir emission , as well as the total h@xmath1 luminosity by almost an order of magnitude",
    ". moreover , at an age around 5  myr the cluster would be too young to host the significant number of rsgs found there .",
    "the large extinction suggests that a significant number of massive stars could be completely hidden by dust , so that while their contribution to the uv continuum would be negligible , almost all their emission would be reradiated in the fir range .",
    "their ionizing flux could also contibute to the br@xmath80 emission observed in the near infrared , as well as to the balmer lines emission .",
    "if this is the case , our analysis would correspond to only a group of massive stars which happen to be less affected by extinction than the bulk of the cluster , so that the results can not be extrapolated to the starburst as a whole .",
    "the mass of stars derived by doyon et al .",
    "( 1994 ) from the near infrared lines is indeed also a factor of 10 larger than the mass we derive from the uv continuum flux , supporting the idea that only a fraction of the stars are visible in the uv .",
    "this scheme is also favoured by the fact that the extinction derived from the balmer decrement is much larger than the value derived from uv continuum fits ( @xmath21 = 0.85 vs. 0.16 , respectively ) .",
    "while no contribution at all is expected from the hidden stars in the uv , we would expect some contribution from the obscured regions at h@xmath63 wavelengths , yielding a large global balmer decrement .",
    "we conclude that starbursts taking place in dusty regions of merging galaxies can have a rather different appearance from those of bcgs : flat uv continua due to the strong extinction , reddened emission lines , hidden massive stars , etc ... these are the properties expected for the starburst powering ultraluminous iras galaxies , in several of which the uv continuum could even not be detected",
    ". nevertheless , the intrinsic properties of the star formation processes are similar to those of the dust  free weaker bursts observed in other objects .",
    "we have analyzed the properties of the star formation episodes taking place in a sample of blue compact and irregular galaxies . we have applied our evolutionary population synthesis models to a multiwavelength data set , including independent uv , optical , fir and radio parameters related to different physical processes . comparing the predicted with the observational values of the different parameters we have been able to constrain the age , the star formation regime ( instantaneous or extended ) and the initial mass function slope of the massive star formation processes powering these galaxies , as well as the shape and strength of the interstellar extinction affecting them .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows :    * formation of massive stars proceeds by episodic , very short bursts , so that the stars can be considered to be essentially coeval .",
    "nevertheless , the superposition of several of these short bursts at different times could mimic in some cases a star formation process extended during several million years when the integrated emission from an object is analyzed . *",
    "massive star clusters with nearly instantaneous bursts have ages below 5 - 6 myr with an average around 3.5  myr .",
    "older bursts would not produce enough ionizing flux to be detected as emission line galaxies .",
    "powerful iras galaxies might be postburst galaxies , characterized by a strong firemission with very weak emission lines .",
    "* despite the large range in the number of stars formed and the amount of gas transformed ( covering 4 orders of magnitude ) the derived imf shows a slope in average very close to the solar neighbourhood value",
    ". the imf does not seem to depend onto the various star formation scenarios in objects as different as giant regions , bcgs , starburst nuclei and merging galaxies .",
    "we have found no correlation between the deviations from this mean value and the metallicity , morphology or interaction state of these galaxies .",
    "* emission associated to these starbursts completely dominates the uv , optical and fir ranges , indicating that the present bursts might have been one of the strongest in their history or in some cases the first global episode of massive star formation . in some galaxies",
    "however the contribution of the young stars to the optical continuum is comparable to the emission associated to older stars formed in preceding bursts . *",
    "no starbursts have been found with @xmath14 as high as predicted by the models for the first 2  myr after massive star have been formed , despite the evidences that stars with initial masses close to 100  m@xmath2 form in these galaxies with an imf slope similar to that of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the fact that already during accretion stars more massive than 40  m@xmath2 might burn a substantial fraction of its central hydrogen could lead to smaller effective temperatures and ionizing powers in the first 2  myr , possibly explaining so this effect .",
    "* low mass stars formation should take place in these regions before the most massive stars ignite , and would nt be therefore strictly coeval to them .",
    "otherwise , they would end their slow collapse when the most massive stars are already evolved and the ionizing flux of the cluster has almost completely faded , not being any longer recognized as a starburst . * the observed population of wolf - rayet stars is well reproduced by current models .",
    "the detection of large @xmath60 ratios is the strongest indication of a short duration star formation episode . *",
    "the relatively blue @xmath0 colors measured in izw  18 , which has been forming massive stars during several myr , confirms the predictions of current stellar evolutionary tracks that very few red supergiants would be formed at low metallicities . * a relatively large number of supernova explosions ( up to 1 per 100 years ) is expected to take place in these compact regions .",
    "thousands of supernova remnants have to be present in the most evolved of these starbursts .",
    "the release of kinetic energy and the ejection of metals must severely disturb the interstellar gas producing bubbles and metal enriched outflowing winds . *",
    "the good agreement between observed and predicted fir luminosities excludes in general the possibility that a significant number of massive stars could be hidden within uv - optical opaque clouds , although this probably happens in some individual objects . *",
    "the extinction follows a law similar to the lmc and smc ones , with a very weak absorption bump at 2175   , if any .",
    "there is no dependence between the shape of the extinction law and the metallicity or the size of the regions , indicating that the strong radiation associated to the burst has destroyed the dust components responsible for the uv bump .",
    "we find no need to invoke a specific extinction law other than the lmc or smc ones . *",
    "the strength of the extinction derived from the balmer decrement is in many cases larger than the one obtained from the uv continuum .",
    "while the contamination by strong stellar absorption lines , with equivalent widths around 4 - 5   could explain the discrepancy in some cases , it is more likely related to the inhomogeneous distribution of stars , ionized gas and dust .",
    "dust particles concentrate along patchy structures far away from the continuum sources , but still within the ionized gas , affecting more the emission lines than the continuum .",
    "the trend toward higher values of the nebular extinction , the more evolved the regions , suggests that the newly formed dust grains are ejected far away from the progenitor stars .",
