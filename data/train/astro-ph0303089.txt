    "the wealth of new data from e.g. the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large - scale structure ( lss ) in the last few years indicate that we live in a flat universe where @xmath8 of the mass - energy density is in the form of dark energy , with matter making up the remaining 30 % .",
    "the wmap data combined with other large - scale structure data @xcite gives impressive support to this picture .",
    "furthermore , the baryons contribute only a fraction @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the contribution of baryons and of all matter to the total density in units of the critical density @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the present value of the hubble parameter ) of this , so that most of the matter is dark .",
    "the exact nature of the dark matter in the universe is still unknown .",
    "relic neutrinos are abundant in the universe , and from the observations of oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos we know that neutrinos have a mass @xcite and will make up a fraction of the dark matter .",
    "however , the oscillation experiments can only measure differences in the squared masses of the neutrinos , and not the absolute mass scale , so they can not tell us how much of the dark matter is in neutrinos . from general arguments on structure formation in the universe",
    "we know that most of the dark matter has to be cold , i.e. non - relativistic when it decoupled from the thermal background .",
    "neutrinos with masses on the ev scale or below will be a hot component of the dark matter .",
    "if they were the dominant dark - matter component , structure in the universe would have formed first at large scales , and smaller structures would form by fragmentation ( the ` top - down ' scenario ) . however , the combined observational and theoretical knowledge about large - scale structure gives strong evidence for the ` bottom - up ' picture of structure formation , i.e. structure formed first at small scales .",
    "hence , neutrinos can not make up all of the dark matter ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "neutrino experiments give some constraints on how much of the dark matter can be in the form of neutrinos .",
    "studies of the energy spectrum in tritium decay @xcite provide an upper limit on the electron neutrino mass of 2.2 ev ( 95 % confidence limit ) .",
    "for the effective neutrino mass scale involved in neutrinoless double beta decay an upper limit of 0.34 ev ( 90 % confidence ) has been inferred @xcite but then under the assumptions that neutrinos are majorana particles ( i.e. their own antiparticles ) , and the translation from the effective neutrino mass scale in neutrinoless double beta decay to neutrino mass eigenvalues requires assumptions about the neutrino mass hierarchy and the cp phases in the neutrino mixing matrix .    from cosmology , an analysis the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite found @xmath0 as an upper limit on the sum of the ( degenerate ) mass eigenvalues . in @xcite the 2dfgrs was combined with pre - wmap cmb data to give an upper limit @xmath13 .",
    "the wmap team @xcite improved this result to @xmath14 ( 95 % confidence ) from a combination of wmap , acbar @xcite , cbi @xcite for the cmb , and 2dfgrs and the power spectrum inferred from lyman @xmath7 forest @xcite for large scale structure , a factor of roughly three better than the 2dfgrs limit ( not an order of magnitude as stated in @xcite ) .",
    "this limit is comparable to what the pioneering study in @xcite predicted would be possible with the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and wmap @xcite , and have implications for neutrino oscillation experiments as it seems to call into question the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) result @xcite , where the mass - square difference involved was @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "( however , as pointed out in @xcite it is premature to say that cosmology rules out the lsnd results . )",
    "note that neutrinos with ev masses are basically indistinguishable from cold dark matter at the epoch of last scattering , and therefore they have little effect on the cmb .",
    "the important role of the wmap data in the cosmological neutrino mass limit is to break degeneracies in the parameter space that will otherwise limit the ability to constrain neutrino masses from the large - scale structure data .    in this paper",
    "we discuss in detail the recent cosmological neutrino mass limits , concentrating on the 2dfgrs and the wmap + 2dfgrs limits and the various parameter degeneracies involved in the analysis .",
    "in particular we discuss the role of the bias of the galaxy distribution with respect to the mass distribution , non - linear effects , and the necessity of using independent information about cosmological parameters like @xmath2 and @xmath16 ( ` priors ' )",
    ". we will throughout this paper work within the context of flat @xmath17 models , which are favoured by a wealth of observational data @xcite , however we also comment on mixed dark matter ( mdm ) models in discussion of the analysis of the 2dfgrs data .",
    "in fact we find that an mdm model can still provide a reasonable fit to the 2dfgrs and wmap data , although with a low hubble constant , so that external constraints on the hubble constant are important in order to get a strong upper limit on the neutrino masses .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we give a brief overview of how neutrinos affect structure formation in the universe . in section 3",
    "we consider galaxy redshift surveys as a probe of neutrino masses , starting with a brief summary of the analysis in @xcite .",
    "since the exact relationship between the distribution of the galaxies and that of the dark matter is unknown , we discuss different ways of taking this uncertainty into account .",
    "we also discuss the role of priors on parameters degenerate with massive neutrinos . in section 4",
    "we give a brief overview of other cosmological probes of neutrino masses before we summarize and conclude in section 5 .",
    "the relic abundance of neutrinos in the universe today is straightforwardly found from the fact that they continue to follow the fermi - dirac distribution after freeze - out , and their temperature is given in terms of the cmb temperature @xmath18 today as @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , which gives @xmath22 at present .",
    "neutrinos are so light that they were ultra - relativistic at freeze - out . their present contribution to the mass density can therefore be found by multiplying @xmath23 with the total mass of the neutrinos @xmath24 , giving @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "several effects could modify this simple relation .",
    "if any of the neutrino chemical potentials were initially non - zero , or there were a sizable neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry , this would increase the energy density in neutrinos and give an additional contribution to the radiation energy density .",
    "however , from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) one gets a very tight limit on the electron neutrino chemical potential , since the electron neutrino is directly involved in the processes that set the neutron - to - proton ratio .",
    "also , within the standard three - neutrino framework one can extend this limit to the other flavours as well .",
    "the recent results of the kamland experiment @xcite confirmed the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution for the solar neutrino oscillations , and combined with the atmospheric data indicating maximal mixing in this sector , it has been shown that flavour equilibrium is established between all three neutrino species before the epoch of bbn @xcite , so that the bbn constraint on the electron neutrino asymmetry applies to all flavours , which in turn implies that the lepton asymmetry can not be large enough to give a significant contribution to the radiation energy density .",
    "recent analyses of wmap and 2dfgrs data give independent , although not quite as strong , evidence for small lepton asymmetries @xcite . within the standard picture ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : relicabund ] ) should be accurate , and therefore any constraint on the cosmic mass density of neutrinos should translate straightforwardly into a constraint on the total neutrino mass , according to equation ( [ eq : omeganu ] ) . if a fourth , light ` sterile ' neutrino exists , sterile - active oscillations would modify this conclusion .",
    "no sterile neutrinos are required to explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation data @xcite , and the only hint so far comes from the possible detection of @xmath27 oscillations with a small mixing angle and a mass - square difference @xmath15 at the lsnd @xcite .",
    "since there are only two independent mass - squared differences in the standard three - neutrino scenario , and they are orders of magnitude smaller , this hints at the existence of a fourth , light sterile neutrino . however , as said , this has little support in the solar and atmospheric data .",
    "the status of the lsnd results will in the near future be clarified by the miniboone experiment @xcite .",
    "finally , we assume that the neutrinos are nearly degenerate in mass .",
    "current cosmological observations are sensitive to neutrino masses @xmath28 or greater . since the mass - square differences are small , the assumption of a degenerate mass hierarchy is therefore justified .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , where we have plotted the mass eigenvalues @xmath29 as functions of @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( solar ) and @xmath32 ( atmospheric ) , for the cases of a normal hierarchy ( @xmath33 ) , and an inverted hierarchy ( @xmath34 ) . as seen in the figure , for @xmath35",
    "the mass eigenvalues are essentially degenerate .    , 2dfgrs , and @xmath36 @xmath37 decay.,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ] , 2dfgrs , and @xmath36 @xmath37 decay.,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ]    we will in this paper look at cosmological models with four components : baryons , cold dark matter , massive neutrinos , and a cosmological constant . furthermore , we restrict ourselves to adiabatic , linear perturbations .",
    "the basic physics is then fairly simple . a perturbation mode of a given wavelength @xmath38 can grow if it is greater than the jeans wavelength @xmath39 determined by the balance of gravitation and pressure , or rms velocity in the case of massless particles .",
    "above the jeans scale , perturbations grow at the same rate independently of the scale .",
    "long after matter - radiation equality , all interesting scales are above @xmath39 and grow at the same rate , and in models where all the dark matter is cold , the time and scale dependence of the power spectrum can therefore be separated at low redshifts .",
    "light , massive neutrinos can , however , move unhindered out regions below a certain limiting length scale , and will therefore tend to damp a density perturbation at a rate which depends on their rms velocity .",
    "the presence of massive neutrinos therefore introduces a new length scale , given by the size of the co - moving jeans length when the neutrinos became non - relativistic . in terms of the comoving wavenumber ,",
    "this is given by @xmath40 for three equal - mass neutrinos .",
    "the growth of fourier modes with @xmath41 will be suppressed because of neutrino free - streaming .",
    "the free - streaming scale varies with the cosmological epoch , and the scale and time dependence of the power spectrum can not be separated , in contrast to the situation for models with cold dark matter only .",
    "the transfer functions of the perturbations in the various components provide a convenient way of describing their evolution on different scales . using the redshift @xmath42 to measure time , the transfer function is formally defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the density perturbation with wavenumber @xmath45 at redshift @xmath42 , and @xmath46 is the linear growth factor .",
    "the normalization redshift @xmath47 corresponds to a time long before the scales of interested have entered the horizon .",
    "the transfer function thus gives the amplitude of a given mode @xmath45 at redshift @xmath42 relative to its initial value , and is normalized so that @xmath48 .",
    "the power spectrum of the matter fluctuations can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the primordial spectrum of matter fluctuations , commonly assumed to be a simple power law @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the amplitude and the spectral index @xmath53 is close to 1 .",
    "it is also common to define power spectra for each component , see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "note that the transfer functions and power spectra are independent of the value of the cosmological constant as long as it does not shift the epoch of matter - radiation equality significantly .",
    "accurate determination of the transfer function requires the solution of the coupled fluid and boltzmann equations for the various components .",
    "this can be done using one of the publicly available codes , e.g. cmbfast @xcite or camb @xcite .",
    "analytical approximations are also available , and they are very useful when one wants very quick computation of transfer functions .",
    "accurate fitting formulas for the transfer function were derived by @xcite .",
    "these analytic approximations are good at realistic baryon fractions , i.e. 0.1 - 0.2 , with the errors typically smaller than 4 % . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we show the transfer functions for models with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 held constant , but with varying neutrino fraction .",
    "one can clearly see that the small - scale suppression of power becomes more pronounced as the neutrino fraction @xmath57 increases .",
    "the suppression of the power spectrum on small scales is roughly proportional to @xmath58 : @xmath59     to the one for @xmath60 .",
    "the other parameters are fixed at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56.,width=317 ]",
    "in an earlier short paper @xcite we used the power spectrum of the galaxies as measured by the 2dfgrs to limit the fractional contribution @xmath61 to the matter density of massive neutrinos , and on their total mass @xmath62 .",
    "the present section starts with a short summary of the 2dfgrs and the analysis in @xcite before going into a more detailed discussion of the various ingredients involved in the analysis . in @xcite",
    "the wmap team derived a stronger limit on the total neutrino mass than what was obtained from the 2dfgrs + various priors .",
    "however , the 2dfgrs power spectrum played a central role in the wmap neutrino mass limit .",
    "as the cmb is insensitive to neutrino masses in the ev range , the main role of the wmap data is to provide tight constraints on parameters that may otherwise partly mimic the effect of massive neutrinos on the matter power spectrum .",
    "therefore our discussion of priors should also be of interest in understanding how the wmap limit was obtained .",
    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite has measured the redshifts of more than 230 000 galaxies with a median redshift of @xmath63 .",
    "one of the main goals of the survey was to measure the galaxy power spectrum on scales up to a few hundred mpc , thus filling in the gap between the small scales covered by earlier galaxy surveys and the largest scales where the power spectrum is constrained by observations of the cmb .",
    "a sample of the size of the 2dfgrs survey allows large - scale structure statistics to be measured with very small random errors .",
    "an initial estimate of the convolved , redshift - space power spectrum of the 2dfgrs has been determined @xcite based on a sample of 140 000 redshifts . on scales",
    "@xmath64 the data are robust and the shape of the power spectrum is not affected by redshift - space or nonlinear effects , though the amplitude is increased by redshift - space distortions .",
    "one should bear in mind that what is measured is the convolution of the true galaxy power spectrum with the window function of the survey @xcite , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the window function .",
    "( bottom line ) and @xmath67 ( top line ) to the one for @xmath60 ( horizontal line ) with amplitudes fitted to the 2dfgrs power spectrum data ( vertical bars ) in redshift space .",
    "we have fixed @xmath54 , @xmath56 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the vertical dashed lines limit the range in @xmath45 used in the fits.,width=317 ]    as an illustration of the potential of the 2dfgrs to constrain neutrino masses , we show in figure [ fig : fig3 ] the ratio of the power spectra for @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ( all other parameters are fixed at their ` concordance model ' values given in the figure caption ) to the power spectrum for @xmath71 after they have been convolved with the survey window function , and their amplitudes fitted to the 2dfgrs power spectrum data .",
    "it is seen from figure [ fig : fig3 ] that the error bars on the power spectrum data points are correlated , as discussed in @xcite , and this is taken into account throughout this paper by using the full covariance matrix of the data when computing likelihoods .",
    "for the 32 data points , the @xmath71-model had @xmath72 , @xmath73 gives @xmath74,whereas the model with @xmath67 provides a poor fit to the data with @xmath75 .",
    "in @xcite six parameters were used to describe the matter power spectrum :    * the fraction of massive neutrinos ( hot dark matter ) @xmath76 . * the combination @xmath77 , which describes the shape of the cold dark matter power spectrum . * the baryon fraction @xmath78 . * the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath16 . * the scalar spectral index of the primordial density perturbation spectrum , @xmath53 . * the amplitude @xmath52 of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "the amplitude is a free parameter to take into account the fact that what is measured is the power spectrum of galaxies , not of all the matter , and that it is measured in redshift space , not in real space .",
    "the latter effect has been shown in @xcite to correspond to a shift in the amplitude of the spectrum .",
    "the first effect is parametrized by the so - called bias parameter @xmath79 the scale - dependence of the bias factor is not well known .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in a later subsection , for the time being we note that one would expect the relation between the distribution of dark matter and luminous matter to be simple on large scales .",
    "this is borne out by numerical simulations @xcite , and two independent analyses have shown that the 2dfgrs power spectrum is consistent with a constant bias on the scales relevant for our analysis @xcite .",
    "thus , we took the redshift space distortions and the bias into account by leaving the amplitude @xmath52 of the power spectrum as a free parameter , which means that we used the _ shape _ of the 2dfgrs power spectrum , and not its amplitude , to constrain @xmath80 .",
    "the main effect of the massive neutrinos is to reduce the power on scales smaller than the neutrino free - streaming scale .",
    "this effect may , however , be partially masked by other effects .",
    "obviously , lowering the amplitude or the scalar spectral index @xmath53 will reduce the power . also",
    ", the baryon fraction and @xmath77 interfere with the neutrino signal .",
    "therefore , constraints on the neutrino mass from the galaxy power spectrum depends on the information we have about other parameters ( ` priors ' ) . in @xcite",
    "we added constraints from independent cosmological probes : a gaussian prior on the hubble parameter @xmath81 , consistent with the results from the hst hubble key project @xcite , a gaussian prior @xmath82 on the physical baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , and a gaussian prior @xmath83 on the scalar spectral index .",
    "furthermore , we considered two different priors on @xmath2 :    * under the assumption of @xmath84 , a gaussian prior @xmath85 was obtained from surveys of high redshift type ia supernovae @xcite . *",
    "a uniform ( ` top hat ' ) prior in the range @xmath86 .",
    "given our prior on @xmath16 , @xmath87 ensured that the ages of the universes in the models considered were greater than 12 gyr .",
    "as noted earlier , the transfer function does not depend on @xmath88 and so the assumption @xmath89 enters only through the supernova type ia prior on @xmath2 .    for each set of parameters ,",
    "we computed the theoretical matter power spectrum , and obtained the @xmath90 for the model given the 2dfgrs power spectrum .",
    "we then calculated the joint probability distribution function for @xmath58 and @xmath91 ( which represents the shape of the cdm power spectrum ) by marginalizing over @xmath92 and @xmath93 weighted by the priors given above .",
    "for @xmath52 we used a uniform prior in the interval @xmath94 , where @xmath95 corresponds to the normalization of the ` concordance model ' , discussed in @xcite . using",
    "instead a prior uniform in @xmath96 , or fixing @xmath52 at the best - fit value had virtually no effect on the results .",
    "with marginalization over the other parameters , as explained in the text , for @xmath97 massive neutrinos and @xmath98 ( full line ) , @xmath99 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath100 ( dashed line).,width=317 ]    figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the probability distributions for @xmath80 for three different values of @xmath77 .",
    "marginalizing over @xmath101 using the uniform prior on @xmath2 , we got an upper limit @xmath102 at 95% confidence for @xmath103 . increasing @xmath53 increases power on small scales and leaves more room for suppression by the massive neutrinos , and and upon marginalizing over the full range of @xmath53 with a prior @xmath83 we found @xmath104 at 95 % confidence . for @xmath105",
    "this corresponds to a total neutrino mass @xmath106 .",
    "the results with the supernova type ia prior on @xmath2 were identical .",
    "for comparison , marginalizing without any priors , the limit becomes @xmath107 .",
    "adding just a prior on @xmath2 , we find @xmath108 , so this is clearly the most important prior .",
    "marginalizing with just a prior on @xmath16 or on @xmath109 , the 95 % confidence limit becomes @xmath110 .",
    "clearly the priors play a crucial role in the analysis , and we will discuss their role in the next subsections . to facilitate the comparison with the wmap analysis in @xcite we will from now on carry out our analysis in terms of the physical densities @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .      as noted above , the prior on the matter density is crucial , and the tight correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath115 is illustrated in figure [ fig : fig5 ] .     and the physical matter density @xmath115 .",

    "wmap provides a constraint @xmath119 for spatially flat @xmath17 models , but it is interesting to note that one from the cmb and 2dfgrs alone can not rule out models with @xmath120 . to illustrate this point , we consider the following three models , all with @xmath121 :    1 .   a mixed dark matter ( mdm ) model with @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",

    "model 2 has @xmath132 for the cmb , @xmath133 for the 2dfgrs .",
    "the wmap data discriminate better between these two models , model 1 having @xmath134 ( 899 points ) and model 2 @xmath135 , but we see from figure [ fig : fig6 ] that the models are look reasonable and note that we have not carried out any systematic search for a best - fitting model of the three types . thus , the first two models seem to offer acceptable descriptions of the cmb and 2dfgrs data , and from these data alone mdm is still a viable alternative to the ` concordance ' @xmath17 .",
    "so why did several pre - wmap studies find that the cmb and 2dfgrs prefer a low matter density and a cosmological constant ?",
    "this is because they considered ( very reasonably ) neutrinos to be essentially massless .",
    "model 3 illustrates the point : it is a pure cdm model with massless neutrinos .",
    "it gives a reasonable description of the cmb data , but has @xmath136 for the 2dfgrs data points , and hence it will be disfavoured in a joint analysis .",
    "the cmb can not distinguish between ev - mass neutrinos and cold dark matter , and hence model 1 and 3 provide comparable descriptions of the cmb data , but the galaxy power spectrum does distinguish between the two , and massive neutrinos provides the necessary reduction in small - scale power to fit the data points .",
    "of course , one can not look at the cmb and 2dfgrs data alone , and it is not our intention to ` resuurect ' the mdm model : it has problems with the evolution of cluster abundances with redshift @xcite , needs a low value of the hubble parameter , and @xmath129 is clearly at variance with independent measurements from e.g. the baryon fraction in clusters @xcite , but we wish to make the two following points :    * the cmb + 2dfgrs alone can not rule out mdm ; one needs a further prior , e.g. the hubble constant from hst @xcite , supernovae type ia @xcite , a prior on @xmath2 from the cluster baryon fraction @xcite , or evolution of cluster abundance with redshift @xcite . *",
    "the statement that cmb + 2dfgrs alone provides evidence independent of that of supernovae type ia for a cosmological constant / dark energy is too strong .",

    "we use the approximate relation between the the linear and non - linear spectrum found by @xcite .",
    "the cut in the spectrum should be made where the non - linear effects are of the same order as the suppression of small scale - power from massive neutrinos , which is given by equation ( [ eq : fnusuppr ] ) .",
    "for neutrino masses @xmath28 , this gives @xmath153 .",
    "we chose @xmath154 in our analysis , and at that point @xmath155 .",
    "crude as this argument may be , it clearly indicates that the neutrino mass signal dominates possible non - linear effects in the 2dfgrs power spectrum data used in our analysis .",
    "we note that the linear matter power spectrum is convolved with the survey window function before comparison with the data .",
    "however , for values of @xmath45 greater than @xmath156 the window function is sharply peaked at @xmath45 , and so there is little mixing with smaller scales @xcite .",
    "the wmap team went one step further and considered non - linear corrections at the smallest scales in the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , one would expect these effects to be small for @xmath157 .",
    "the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution might be ` biased ' relative to the matter power spectrum , hence it might introduce systematic error in the estimation of the neutrino mass .    indeed it is well established that on scales less than @xmath158 different galaxy populations exhibit different clustering amplitudes , the so - called morphology - density relation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hierarchical merging scenarios also suggest a more complicated picture of biasing as it could be non - linear , scale - dependent and stochastic ( e.g. @xcite . but",
    "is the biasing still scale - dependent at the large scales ( @xmath159 ) where we analyse the 2dfgrs power spectrum ?",
    "let us consider the ratio of galaxy to matter power spectra , and use the ratio of these to define the bias parameter as in equation ( [ eq : biasfac ] ) . to illustrate the dramatic effect that scale - dependent might have we assume the following simple form : @xmath160 where we fix @xmath161 (",
    "note that a shift in @xmath162 can be absorbed in a change in @xmath163 ) , but allow @xmath164 and @xmath163 to vary .",

    "even the brightest galaxies ( @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the characteristic luminosity of the schechter luminosity function ) are weakly biased , with slope @xmath168 over the scales @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "the simulations in @xcite also suggest scale - independent biasing on scales larger than 10 @xmath170 at late times .",
    "observationally , the bi - spectrum analysis of the 2dfgrs showed almost no deviation from linear biasing @xcite and combined analysis of 2dfgrs with cmb data on scales of @xmath171 @xcite gave @xmath172 for @xmath167 galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the power - spectra of blue and red galaxies in 2dfgrs @xcite is almost constant over the range of our analysis , @xmath171 .",
    "this suggests ( as a necessary , but not sufficient condition ) that the galaxy power spectrum is proportional to the underlying matter power spectrum .",
    "based on these theoretical and observational studies we argue that scale - dependent biasing is unlikely to pose a problem in estimating the neutrino mass from the 2dfgrs .",
    "we then redo the analysis of the 2dfgrs @xmath173 with @xmath118 , @xmath164 and @xmath163 as free parameters .",

    "wmap provides tight constraints on @xmath115 , @xmath16 , @xmath53 , and @xmath117 , and we have seen in previous subsections that having good constraints on these parameters is essential to obtaining a good upper limit on @xmath24 .",
    "also , from the cmb one can constrain the amplitude of the matter power spectrum ( quoted , e.g. in terms of the rms mass fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath184 , @xmath116 ) . if the biasing and redshift - space distortions were known",

    "as the analysis in @xcite was performed for a different range of scales than those involved in the analysis of the linear part of the 2dfgrs power spectrum , and did not take neutrino masses into account ( even though the cosmology dependence in the bispectrum analysis is mild ) and questions have been raised about this approach @xcite , it is worthwhile to take a closer look at the wmap approach . to do this",
    ", we need to go into the issue of a constant bias and redshift - space distortions in more detail than in the previous sections , and we will do so following @xcite .",
    "the wmap analysis was more detailed @xcite , but we think that our simplified version captures the main points .",

    "we have checked that this scale dependence is weak for the parameter range we consider , and evaluated @xmath199 at @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the mean value of @xmath45 for a spherical top - hat window function . with these assumptions",
    "we have @xmath202 given @xmath203 , we can translate a given normalization @xmath187 of the matter power spectrum to @xmath204 for the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "we now carry out the following simple analysis : we fix @xmath205 , @xmath206 ( all values taken from table 1 in @xcite for wmap alone ) , and fit @xmath118 , @xmath115 , @xmath16 , @xmath207 and @xmath203 to the combination of the 2dfgrs power spectrum data and the constraint @xmath208 from table 2 in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we add gaussian priors @xmath209 , @xmath210 from wmap , and look at the limit on @xmath211 for the cases of with and without a prior on @xmath212 .",

    ", width=317 ]    this is not in contradiction to the analysis in @xcite , because our treatment of biasing is different : we have treated the redshift - space distortions explicitly , and then the constraint on @xmath116 and @xmath115 from the cmb breaks much of the degeneracy between @xmath118 and @xmath215 .",
    "this is because the redshift distortion itself depends on @xmath2 , see equations ( [ eq : bias3],[eq : bias4 ] ) .    in this simple analysis",
    "we get a 95 % confidence limit of @xmath217 .",
    "this is still some way from the wmap limit of 0.71 ev , even with our very restricted parameter space , but consistent with the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the wmap analysis also used data from acbar and cbi @xcite , and included the lyman @xmath7 forest power spectrum . the linear matter power spectrum inferred from the lyman",
    "@xmath7 fores probes smaller scales than the 2dfgrs and therefore has considerable power in constraining neutrino masses .",
    "we have seen that the most severe degeneracies of @xmath118 are with @xmath115 , @xmath53 , @xmath16 , and @xmath117 .",
    "the most serious one is with @xmath115 : without a prior on the physical matter density , one can not get a non - trivial upper bound on @xmath24 .",
    "this makes sense , as the matter power spectrum depends on @xmath61 and this is why the analysis was carried out in terms of this parameter in @xcite .",
    "so the fact that wmap ( restricted to flat @xmath17 models and @xmath218 ) provides a tight constraint @xmath219 is crucial for constraining neutrino masses .",
    "wmap also constrains the spectral index to a narrow interval around @xmath103 , and , just as importantly , by constraining @xmath16 to be around 0.7 eliminates the possibility for mdm models with large neutrino masses to give good fits to the 2dfgrs power spectrum .",
    "the importance of the prior on @xmath16 was also noted in @xcite .",
    "direct probes of the total matter distribution avoid the issue of biasing and are therefore ideally suited for providing limits on the neutrino masses . several ideas for how this can be done exist .",
    "in @xcite the normalization of the matter power spectrum on large scales derived from cobe was combined with constraints on @xmath116 from cluster abundances and a constraint @xmath220 obtained , although with a fairly restricted parameter space .",
    "however , @xmath116 is probably one of the most debated numbers in cosmology at the moment @xcite , and a better understanding of systematic uncertainties connected with the various methods for extracting it from observations is needed before this method can provide useful constraints .",
    "the potential of this method to push the value of the mass limit down also depends on the actual value of @xmath221 : the higher @xmath116 turns out to be , the less room there will be for massive neutrinos .",
    "the evolution of cluster abundance with redshift may provide further constraints on neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "the lyman @xmath7 forest provides constraints on the matter power spectrum on small scales , where the effect of massive neutrinos is most visible , and it was used in @xcite to derive a limit @xmath222 , and it clearly played a role in the wmap limit also .",
    "how to use this probe correctly in cosmological parameter estimation is , however , still being discussed @xcite .",
    "massive neutrinos also suppress peculiar velocities on scales smaller than @xmath223 , where they can be measured more accurately to nearby galaxies , however , non - linear effects on small scales causes complications .",
    "finally , deep and wide weak lensing surveys will in the future make it possible to do weak lensing tomography of the matter density field @xcite , and in @xcite it has been shown that one can probe neutrino masses below @xmath224 in this way",
    ". however , this is under the assumption that the equation of state of the dark energy is known .",
    "we have reviewed how the constraint on the neutrino mass in @xcite was obtained , and the recent improved limit from wmap , paying attention to issues of priors and parameter degeneracies .",
    "we have seen that one can derive fairly tight constraints on neutrino masses from the 2dfgrs power spectrum , provided that one has good constraints on @xmath115 , @xmath53 , @xmath16 , and @xmath117 from independent data sets .",
    "we found that external constraints on the hubble parameter , for example the hst key project , is important in order to get a strong limit on the neutrino mass since , intriguingly , the out - of - fashion mixed dark matter ( mdm ) model can give a reasonable description of the cmb and 2dfgrs data with @xmath138 , @xmath129 and no cosmological constant if we allow low values of the hubble parameter , @xmath142 .",
    "the importance of having a prior on @xmath16 was also noted in @xcite .",
    "we note that the above mdm model is inconsistent with other cosmic measurements such as supernovae type ia , baryon fraction in clusters , and the evolution of cluster abundance with redshift , so adding any one of these datasets to the analysis would eliminate mdm and improve the neutrino mass limit .",
    "we also considered the effect of the possible bias of the galaxy distribution with respect to the mass distribution on the neutrino mass limit .",
    "a scale - dependent bias has serious implications for the @xmath24 constraint , but based on semi - analytic galaxy formation models @xcite the scale - dependence of the bias is expected to be too weak to be of any major concern on the large scales used in the analysis of the 2dfgrs power spectrum .",
    "when the effects of redshift - space distortions on the 2dfgrs power spectrum are included in the analysis , there is almost no degeneracy between a constant , scale - independent bias factor and the neutrino mass .",
    "however , in our restricted analysis we did not get as good a neutrino mass constraint with 2dfgrs + wmap priors as in the full analysis in @xcite which suggests that the lyman @xmath7 forest power spectrum plays a role in pushing the constraint on @xmath24 below 1 ev .",
