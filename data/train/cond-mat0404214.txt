    "an analytical solution of the ka model is lacking , and would give a more precise understanding of the relaxation laws , the persistence properties , the existence of a dynamical exponent @xmath93 , and the distributions of cluster sizes , probably to be linked with an analogy with percolation problems @xcite .",

    "<S> we describe spatio - temporal correlations and heterogeneities in a kinetically constrained glassy model , the kob - andersen model . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic constraints of the model alone induce the existence of dynamic correlation lengths , that increase as the density @xmath0 increases , in a way compatible with a double - exponential law . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize in detail the trapping time correlation length , the cooperativity length , and the distribution of persistent clusters of particles . </S>",
    "<S> this last quantity is related to the typical size of blocked clusters that slow down the dynamics for a given density .    </S>",
    "<S> glassy dynamics in kinetically constrained systems has been a subject of wide interest during the last years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it indeed includes a large class of models of particles constrained by dynamical rules where the relaxation is slowed down when the density of particles increases or the temperature decreases , sharing similarities ( though with a number of differences ) with spin - glass models or glass models @xcite when the temperature is decreased . in the former class , slowing down of the dynamics can be understood as a consequence of steric effects , that make certain moves of particles impossible because of an effective high local density , putting strong constraints on the number of allowed paths between configurations @xcite ; whereas for the latter class , frustration and/or disorder in the interactions produces a slow time relaxation . in real glasses </S>",
    "<S> both effects are likely to be present . </S>",
    "<S> while most studies on the glass state have focused for a long time on the latter class of models , more attention is paid to the fact that the former mechanism is also of importance , especially since the works of harrowell @xcite on spatio - temporal heterogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> these heterogeneities are also of great interest for experimentalists , since they have been identified in several glassy systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we will focus on the numerical study of the kob - andersen ( ka ) model @xcite . in this 3-dimensional model of lattice gas on a cubic lattice , a particle can hop to one of its empty nearest neighbor sites only if it has strictly less than @xmath1 occupied nearest - neighbor sites , and if after the hop it will also have less than @xmath1 occupied nearest - neighbor sites ( which ensures detailed balance ) . in the original study of the ka model , the value of @xmath1 is chosen to be @xmath2 , which is a compromise between free diffusion of particles with excluded volume ( @xmath3 ) and a truly non - ergodic model ( for @xmath4 small cubes of occupied sites are blocked for ever ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation is hence a diffusive process with additional steric constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the energy landscape is trivial in the sense that there is no interaction between particles , hence all configurations are thermodynamically equally probable . </S>",
    "<S> however the original numerical study of the ka model showed features similar to those seen in glassy systems such as the arrest of the diffusion constant at some density @xmath5 smaller than 1 ( @xmath6 in @xcite ) , and slow stretched - exponential relaxation of the intermediate scattering function ; though , it was already pointed out by the authors that the mode - coupling predictions for glasses are actually not valid for this model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the dynamics is time translationally invariant ( there is no aging ) , because all configurations are equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> one way to induce aging is to do density crunches ( i.e quenches to higher densities ) in a system where a reservoir of particles is added , as studied in @xcite , or to add explicit two - body interactions between the particles .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the question of finite - size effects in the ka model , already addressed in @xcite , came back , related to the still unsolved issue of a true dynamical transition in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is now established that in the thermodynamic limit and in finite dimension , no dynamical arrest occurs at a density smaller that one @xcite ; whereas in a mean - field version of the model on a bethe lattice , such a dynamical transition at @xmath7 occurs . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the critical density in three dimensions depends on the size @xmath8 of the system like @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a constant , which makes the convergence to @xmath11 very slow and unreachable by numerical simulations . in other words , at fixed density @xmath0 , in order to eliminate finite size effects , one has to study system sizes much larger than the spacing between mobile particles @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally the ka model has been shown to share an important feature with the dynamics of mean - field spin - glass models and supercooled liquids @xcite : the dynamical susceptibility @xmath13 shows a pronounced maximum at an intermediate time @xmath14 , this maximum is interpreted as the time where heterogeneities are the strongest in the system , and increases as the density increases ( analog to a decrease of temperature in other models ) , hinting at the existence of a growing correlation length . because of its purely constrained nature ( no energy barriers , no dynamical transition ) the origin of these spatio - temporal heterogeneities in the ka model comes merely from steric effects @xcite .    in this study </S>",
    "<S> we give a description of the spatio - temporal correlations and heterogeneities that characterize the dynamics of the ka model . </S>",
    "<S> first , we characterize the distribution of trapping times of particles ( for recent work on different systems see for example @xcite ) and its spatial correlations . </S>",
    "<S> then we describe the behavior of the four - point spatio - temporal correlation functions in real space , giving a determination of a cooperative length - scale not provided a priori by @xmath13 , in an approach complementary to @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally we study the dynamics of the ka model in terms of the distribution of persistent clusters ( this is a new approach to the problem ) , and show how spatial heterogeneity and cooperativity can be identified in this way . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the different lengths identified in this study behave in the way predicted by toninelli , biroli and fisher @xcite as a function of the density . </S>"
