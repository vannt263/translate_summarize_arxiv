    "in these proceedings we describe the sacy project .",
    "there we present the gaya , a large nearby young association near the south pole .",
    "another of the possible associations examined was that around the exotic spectroscopic binary ( sb ) classical ttauri star ( ctt ) v4046sgr .",
    "we noted then that around the rcra association ( caa ) there are many young stars with similar kinematics forming a complex about 60pc in diameter . a similar work , deeper in x - ray emission but less in angular extent , has been presented by neuhuser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "frinck ( 1999 ) had already suggested that some of the stars associated with rosat sources could be pms stars ejected from star forming clouds .",
    "the population of x - ray sources around star forming clouds seems to be represented by a mixture of pms and young ms objects .",
    "in addition to the stars in the sacy we observed also some hot members of the caa to obtain their radial velocities . from these data and those in the literature we established a set of nine bona fide caa members with known radial velocities and proper motions ( we re - analysed some cases for this work ) . adopting the distance of the caa as 129pc ( marraco & rydgren , 1981 ) -",
    "five bona fide members that have been measured by hipparcos have parallaxes consistent with this value - we obtained the space velocities : +    ( u , v , w)=(@xmath1)km / s    in figure1a we show the ( u , v ) plane for these members and the sacy s stars having trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the position of the caa in this plane is distinct of any other concentration and there are very few other selected hipparcos stars near this position . although the above scattering 3km / s could be explained by observational errors , it may also reflect a large original velocity dispersion during star formation .",
    "we analysed the observations as in torres et al . in these proceedings .",
    "taking the above space velocities , we used the kinematical method , described in torres et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , to estimate the distances and space velocities for the stars with no reliable hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "the concentration in the caa position in the ( u , v ) plane is enhanced ( figure1b ) . as only stars within 17h@xmath2ra@xmath221h",
    "are in this position ( figure2 ) - exactly where there are no proposed members for the gaya - for sake of visualization in figure1b we converge the stars outside the above range of ra to the uvw of the gaya . the concentration is mainly formed by the nine bona fide stars and 21 stars from sacy ( four in common to neuhuser et al .",
    "2000 ) . in figure2",
    "it is clear that these 21 new probable members may be very far from the clouds of the caa , forming an `` extended caa '' ( eca ) .",
    "it is yet difficult to be sure about the boundaries of the eca , mainly to the west where our survey began .",
    "in fact , the extension is mainly in that direction and it should be noted that this is the correct one for the `` external agent '' that must have influenced the appearance of the caa cloud complex ( graham , 1991 ) . the very interesting sb2 ctt v4046sgr ( not a x - ray source ) may be a member of the eca . in that case",
    "we obtain a kinematical parallax of 15.2mas , somewhat larger than the value of 12.0mas obtained from evolutionary scenarios ( quast et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the mean distance of the 21 new members is 100pc ( figure3a ) .",
    "observational bias will favor the discovery of nearby members , but the spread in distance of @xmath080pc is roughly consistent with the apparent size of the eca .",
    "in fact , the 30 stars are distributed in a projected area with a diameter of @xmath035 , that is , a size of @xmath060pc .    if the original velocity dispersion during star formation was similar to the average modulus of the velocity vectors ( @xmath03km / s ) , it would take @xmath010myr to reach the size of @xmath060pc .",
    "this is similar to the evolutionary age ( neuhuser et al .",
    "2000 ) . actually , we deduced an age somewhat larger ( @xmath015myr ) as we are using closer distances .",
    "but these values are within the uncertainties .",
    "anyway , the new members seem to be older than the bona fide ones . on the other hand",
    ", figure3a suggests that the eca is expanding .",
    "one of the best confirmations of the ptt nature of the proposed members is the behavior of the li lines . in the same spectral range the previously known tts in the caa",
    "have a similar w@xmath3 distribution to the eca showing that there is no significantly different lithium depletion between them ( figure3b ) .",
    "we re - analysed the li abundances of some of these tts . like other authors we obtained abundances from the li resonance line @xmath46707 above the interstellar ones . but using the high quality feros spectra we could use the @xmath46103 line , which is very sensitive to abundances , and the obtained values dropped to the interstellar ones .",
    "exploring a region covering about 30% of the southern hemisphere we found evidences of a great extension of the young caa and it seems to include the very interesting sb2 ctt v4046 sgr .",
    "the extended region is presently represented by at least 20 members , having an age of @xmath010myr .",
    "the distances of its members cover an interval from nearly 60 to about 140pc ( at a mean distance of @xmath0100pc ) giving a diameter of @xmath080pc , compatible with the size produced after @xmath010myr by an initial velocity dispersion of @xmath03km / s . if real , the early caa was a very turbulent environment .",
    "almost all young stars in this region are kinematically possible members . although we found many other young stars in the vast observed austral sky region , only around the caa there are viable candidates for the eca .",
    "this seems very hard to be a chance coincidence and we propose that the caa complex is a very large and young association , resulting from a turbulent initial phase , that is now visualised by the cloud format . the eca may be connected with the upper scorpius association , as both have similar distances and ages , forming a spatial sequence ( see sartori , in these proceedings ) .",
