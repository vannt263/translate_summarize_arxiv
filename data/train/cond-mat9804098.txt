    "the main reason for the study of random hetero - polymers in solutions , is a possible connection of this problem with the protein folding problem @xcite .",
    "indeed , proteins are believed to be by nature selected special cases of random hetero - polymers . before dealing with these special cases ,",
    "it is of great importance to understand the typical behaviour of the various kinds of random hetero - polymer models that have been introduced , as it may give important insight in which types of interactions are indispensible for folding , and which types of interactions , on the other hand , are of secondary importance .",
    "several models of ( quenched ) randomness have been considered . here , we study the role of the solvent ( water ) in the equilibrium @xcite properties of the collapsed phase , as it is commonly believed that the hydrophobic effect @xcite is the main driving force for the folding transition .",
    "most proteins in nature consist of a strongly hydrophobic core , surrounded by hydrophilic ( less hydrophobic ) residues . we restrict ourselves to the simple coarse grained model , that was originally introduced by obukhov @xcite , where the monomers of a single chain are randomly hydrophilic or hydrophobic ( rhh ) , and",
    "interact with the solvent molecules through an effective two - body short range interaction .",
    "the statics of the continuum version of this model has been studied by garel _",
    "@xcite , both in the case of annealed and quenched disorder , while the dynamics ( with quenched disorder ) has been studied by thirumalai _",
    "the model has been studied also by timoshenko _",
    "_ @xcite and moskalenko _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite with the gaussian self - consistent method .",
    "we have choosen to study a ( 2d square ) lattice version of the rhh model , and the method we used to assess the conformational entropy , is the transfer matrix ( tm ) method , which is most fit to study the case of annealed disorder .",
    "furthermore , using the approximation scheme introduced by morita @xcite , we are able to give lower bounds for the quenched free energy .",
    "it will turn out that the annealed case may exhibit a very rich phase diagram and re - entrant compact - swollen transitions , and we come to different conclusion than garel _",
    "the case of the annealed average with fixed mean for the hydrophobic - hydrophilic charges , gives the same results one can get in the continuum limit for the quenched average using the method of reference @xcite ( see section [ disc ] for details ) .",
    "we go one step forward analyzing a better approximation to the quenched system which cures some problems present in the previous approximations and in the standard approach presented in @xcite .",
    "this work is built up in the following way . in section [ defmod ]",
    ", we introduce the model in more detail . in section [ conann ]",
    ", we introduce the concept of constrained annealing ; in section [ phdg ] we show that the effective models after averaging over the disorder involve @xmath1 and @xmath2-body interactions and the general phase diagram of such kind of models is discussed . in section [ tm ] , the tm method is used to assess the conformational entropy of the polymer chain .",
    "the results are presented in section [ res ] , together with an outlook of the items that are still to be investigated .",
    "finally , in section [ disc ] we give an interpretation of our results , and a detailed comparison with those obtained for the continuum model by @xcite .",
    "the polymer chain is represented by a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) on a lattice where each site is either visited by the walk ( i.e. is occupied by one monomer of the chain ) , or occupied by a solvent molecule .",
    "the interactions in the model are two - body short - range interactions .",
    "the only interactions we take into account , are those between solvent molecules and monomers if they occupy nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "hydrophilicities @xmath3 are attached to each monomer @xmath4 of the walk such that the hamiltonian is given by    = -_i=0^n_i z_i  , [ h ]    where the sum runs over the @xmath5 sites of the lattice occupied by the @xmath6-step walk , and @xmath7 is the number of nearest - neighbor contacts of monomer @xmath4 with solvent molecules , i.e. the number of nearest - neighbor sites of site @xmath4 not occupied by the walk .",
    "the hydrophilicities @xmath3 are supposed to be independent identically distributed random variables with a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath8 and variance @xmath9 :    p(_i)=1 ( -(_i-_0)^22 ^ 2 )  , [ p ]    and the average over this ( a priori ) distribution is indicated by @xmath10 . if @xmath11 , the corresponding monomer is hydrophilic and attracts solvent molecules , whereas if @xmath12 , the monomer is hydrophobic and repels solvent molecules .",
    "the canonical partition function for saw of @xmath6 steps with a fixed disorder configuration @xmath13 is then    _ n(\\{_i})=_w_n ( _ i=0^n_i z_i )  , [ z ]    where the sum has to be taken over all @xmath6-step saw starting from the origin .    if monomers can rearrange themselves along the chain and change their hydrophilicities , e.g. with chemical reactions , these have to be considered as thermal annealed variables , which approach equilibrium in the same time scale as the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "the physics of such hetero - polymers is given by the average of the partition function over the disorder distribution ( annealed average )    _ n(\\{_i})=_w_n ( _ 0 _ i=0^nz_i+^2 ^ 22_i=0^nz_i^2 )  .",
    "[ mz ]    instead , if the monomer sequence of the chain is fixed , as it is the case for proteins , the hydrophilicities are frozen while the polymer is approaching thermal equilibrium ; the average over the disorder distribution has then to be taken over the logarithm of the partition sum ( quenched average ) @xcite , to yield the quenched free energy    f_q=-1  , [ fq ]    which is a much harder task to accomplish .",
    "in order to avoid the difficult direct computation of the quenched average ( [ fq ] ) , we have applied an idea first introduced by morita @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called equilibrium ensemble approach ( eea ) ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review and discussion ) .",
    "the eea consists of a systematic approximation procedure for the quenched free energy by annealed averages .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that each successive approximation gives a better or equally good lower bound for the quenched free energy .",
    "each approximation consists in performing an annealed average over a new hamiltonian @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the original hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , and @xmath16 is a fictitious disorder potential , which contains a number of parameters .",
    "these parameters ( lagrange multipliers ) have to be tuned in such a way that some moments of the _ a posteriori _ ( annealed ) distribution of the disorder are equal to the _ a priori _ ( quenched ) ones . in annealed averages , the a posteriori distribution @xmath17 is defined as    p^*(\\{_i},\\{z_i } )  .",
    "[ p * ]    the average over this distribution will be denoted by @xmath18 . in principle",
    ", one has to fix all the moments of @xmath19 to obtain the quenched result , which is as difficult as the direct computation of ( [ fq ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can hope to obtain a reasonable approximation of the quenched case by fixing a few suitably chosen moments .",
    "moreover , the method is variational , and fixing more and more moments yields thighter lower bounds for the quenched free energy .    in this work ,",
    "we have considered three different cases of annealing : without constraints ( @xmath20 ) , constraining the first moment of overall hydrophilicity ( @xmath21 ) , constraining the first and the second moment of overall hydrophilicity ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "for all these cases , we obtain the same formal expression for the effective homo - polymer partition function    _",
    "n^eff=_w_n  , [ b3 ]    and any further complexity is hidden in the computation of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the different cases . the strategy we will follow , is to study the general homo - polymer model defined by ( [ b3 ] ) , in the @xmath26-plane ( the @xmath27 dependence being trivial ) .",
    "then , we investigate to which temperature dependent trajectories in the @xmath26-plane , the three annealed averages give rise .    in case ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "the simple annealed average ( [ mz ] ) has already been computed in the preceding section , and equation ( [ b3 ] ) is recovered with the definitions    _ 0=1  , _",

    "all this , in combination with the numerical data , gives the following qualitative scenario of what happens lowering the temperature :    @xmath151 there exists a particular value @xmath152 such that for @xmath153 the trajectory passes through the multi - critical point , and then follows the coexistence line .",
    "@xmath151 for @xmath154 , the trajectory hits the coexistence line coming from the swollen phase , and this will happen further away from the multi - critical point the larger @xmath155 is .",

    "[ d3 ]    the qualitative behaviour of the trajectories in the phase plane is very similar to that of the previous subsection .",

    "the behaviour of the chain seems qualitatively unchanged adding the constraint on the variance with respect to the fixed mean case .",
    "it can easily be verified that for @xmath171 equations ( [ ga1 ] ) and ( [ ga2 ] ) , defining the trajectories in the ( @xmath160)-plane , are equal , and they are qualitatively very similar for @xmath172 . if we compare the free energies ( [ fa1 ] ) and ( [ fa2 ] ) , however , taking the proper values of @xmath23 into account , we find that the constraint on the variance is crucial for the low temperature behaviour of the free energy . in the fixed mean case ( like in the simple annealed case ) , the free energy diverges linearly to @xmath123 with @xmath173 , whereas fixing also the variance yields a finite free energy .",
    "the divergence can easily be understood .",
    "a fraction ( all , in the simple annealed case ) of the monomers want to be as hydrophilic as possible and to maximize their solvent contacts , in order to minimize the energy , while the other fraction has to be very hydrophobic to keep the mean finite .",
    "for entropical reasons the fractions are exactly @xmath156 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure @xmath174 , where the free energies are compared for the various cases for the same values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "so far , we have only fixed overall moments of the type @xmath175 . in this way",
    ", we do not impose the @xmath3 to be independent variables . or",
    "equivalently , even if we fix all the overall moments , the @xmath3 still have the complete freedom to rearrange themselves along the chain .",
    "hence , we can assume that fixing both mean and variance may be a good approximation for a hetero - polymer , whose hydrophobicities are fixed , but are allowed to migrate . in a protein , however , not only the hydrophilicities , but also the positions along the chain are fixed .",
    "this corresponds to the quenched case .    in order to get a reasonable approximation by means of annealed averages",
    ", one should also ensure the independence of the @xmath3 .",
    "a first try might be to impose e.g. @xmath176 , but after performing the average , one discovers immediately that this would involve a coupling between all the @xmath7 , which , obviously , can not be done by the tm method . instead as a first approach",

    "we expect that fixing the latter , may already qualitatively describe the quenched case very well .",
    "the only reason we did not do the numerics of this case , is of a purely practical nature . in order to calculate @xmath184",
    ", we have to consider configurations on 3 colums instead of on 2 .",
    "this increases the size of the transfer matrix so drastically that we would have to limit ourselves to very narrow strip widths .",
    "furthermore , we have an extra self consistency equation ( i.e. for @xmath179 ) to solve numerically .",
    "all this makes it unfeasible ( in terms of cpu time ) for us at the moment , to perform this calculation for a reasonable strip width ( i.e. @xmath185 ) .",
    "nevertheless , one may anticipate that some of the typical behaviour found for annealed averages , should not be present for the quenched case .",
    "the re - entrant behaviour at intermediate temperatures is due to the competition between the configurational entropy and the energy on the one hand , and the entropy of the @xmath3 distribution on the other hand . in the quenched case ,",
    "the entropy of the @xmath3 distribution is absent , and hence re - entrant behaviour , if present at all , can not have its origin there .",
    "the phase separation ( in low dimensions ) is due to the possibility for the monomers to rearrange and to form a hydrophobic compact core .",
    "since this is not possible for the quenched polymer , we do not expect macroscopic phase separation in that case . instead , microscopic phase separation seems to play an important role for quenched sequences @xcite .",
    "however , one might expect the quenched polymer to behave as an effective homo - polymer , where the groundstate is either swollen or compact , depending on the value @xmath114 .",
    "we have studied a simple lattice model for a random hydrophobic - hydrophilic chain in a solvent , with a gaussian distribution for the hydrophilicities .",
    "we have considered the case of annealed disorder , without constraints , and with constraints on the first and second moments of the overall hydrophobicity .",
    "we have obtained both exact analytical results ( mainly at @xmath186 ) , and numerical ones , employing the transfer matrix technique on a @xmath187 square lattice .",
    "one may ask whether the @xmath187 results are relevant in @xmath188 too . for example , in the random sequence model with charge product interaction , a simple mean field argument shows that @xmath121 is a very peculiar case @xcite . for the considered model",
    ", analytical results at the mean field level @xcite do not show any qualitative difference between different spatial dimensions , and our exact results at @xmath186 exhibit the same qualitative behavior for any @xmath189 .",
    "hence , we believe the tm results in @xmath187 to be meaningful in any dimension @xmath189 .",
    "we now discuss our results and compare them with the ones obtained by garel _",
    "@xcite in the corresponding continuum model .",
    "the main result of @xcite is the fact that the annealed and quenched cases are very similar .",
    "they find that , at sufficiently low temperature , the polymer is always collapsed , even for hydrophilic chains @xmath190 . depending on the average degree of hydrophobicity ,",
    "the transition to the collapsed phase is either first or second order .",
    "@xmath151 for the simple annealed case ( @xmath20 ) , we have shown that for any hydrophobicity @xmath190 the chain is always swollen , while for any @xmath28 , the chain is swollen at sufficiently low temperature . using transfer matrix techniques ,",
    "we have found that , for sufficiently negative @xmath8 , a temperature interval @xmath191 exists , where the chain is collapsed .",
    "coming from the high temperature region the chain undergoes a standard 2nd order @xmath0-point transition at @xmath192 ( in the same universality class as homo - polymers @xcite ) .",
    "lowering the temperature further , the chain undergoes a 1st order ( re - entrant ) transition at @xmath193 towards the swollen phase .",
    "hence , in the annealed case , we come to the opposite conclusion for the low temperature behavior as predicted by garel _",
    "_ @xcite . nevertheless , if one takes the incompressibility of the monomer - solvent system properly into account ( i.e. putting an upper bound on the monomer density ) , it is possible to recover the same qualitative picture in the continuum model of @xcite , too .",
    "@xmath151 in the annealed case with fixing the mean ( @xmath21 ) , we have found that , for any @xmath114 , there is coexistence of the swollen and the collapsed phase ( phase separation ) at sufficiently low temperature , and the chain is exactly half collapsed and half swollen at @xmath186 . for @xmath157 , a temperature interval @xmath191 exists where the chain is collapsed . at @xmath192",
    "the chain undergoes a 2nd order @xmath0-transition from the swollen phase , while at @xmath193 a fraction of the chain swells , and lowering the temperature , the swollen fraction steadily increases to the @xmath186 value @xmath156 . for @xmath154 a temperature @xmath193 exists above which the chain is swollen . at @xmath193",
    "a fraction of the chain collapses , and lowering the temperature , the collapsed fraction of the chain increases steadily to the @xmath186 value @xmath156 .",
    "as already noted in section [ conann ] , the expressions for the quenched case of @xcite are exactly the same as the ones we obtain for the continuum model in the case ( @xmath21 ) . using a one - parameter gaussian trial wave function for the monomer density , garel _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite find a collapsed phase for any @xmath114 at low temperature .",
    "inspired by the observation that they in fact describe the case ( @xmath21 ) , and by the phase separation observed in our lattice model , we tried a one - parameter trial function with a hydrophobic compact core ( fraction @xmath139 ) and hydrophilic swollen tails ( phase separation ) . in the low temperature limit ,",
    "we recover the result @xmath141 , and obtain a free energy that is considerably lower than the one obtained using the trial function of @xcite .",
    "note that the free energy diverges linearly to @xmath123 for @xmath194 , as in the annealed case ( see figure @xmath174 ) .",
    "the same kind of divergence appears in the quenched free energy computed in @xcite , but the quenched free energy should not diverge at zero temperature .",
    "@xmath151 in the annealed case with fixed mean and variance ( @xmath22 ) , we have found very similar results as for the case ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the main differences are that the collapsed fraction of the chain at @xmath186 depends on @xmath114 ( [ fc2 ] ) , and that the free energy does not diverge at @xmath186 .",
    "we repeated these calculations for the continuum model , and again we find that at @xmath186 the phase separation trial function yields a finite groundstate energy lower than the one obtained with a gaussian trial function , and the collapsed fraction of the chain ( @xmath139 ) is found to be exactly ( [ fc2 ] ) .    we conclude that , on the one hand we have good evidence that lattice and continuum models exhibit the same qualitative behavior , if constrained annealing is considered . on the other hand , a good equilibrium description in the case of quenched disorder for this model seems to be lacking at present , and carrying on the constrained annealing approximation procedure ( e.g. by fixing correlations between different hydrophilicities , as explained in the previous section ) may be one way to address the problem of quenched disorder .",
