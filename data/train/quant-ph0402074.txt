    "the most fundamental difference between classical and quantum information is that while classical information can be copied perfectly , quantum information can not",
    ". in particular , it follows from the no - cloning theorem @xcite that one can not create a perfect duplicate of an arbitrary qubit .",
    "nevertheless , buzek and hillery and other authors @xcite have shown that imperfect copies can be made by a universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) , the outputs of which are identical .",
    "the price which must be paid is that there is a difference between the original input and the copies , because of residual entanglement between the machine and copies .",
    "however , not only similarity is lost during the cloning process .",
    "perhaps even more import than the no - cloning feature of quantum mechanics is entanglement , first noted by einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr)and schrdinger @xcite . for decades , quantum entanglement has been the focus of much work in the foundations of quantum mechanics . in particular",
    ", it is associated with quantum nonseparability , the violation of bell s inequalities , and the so - called epr paradox . beyond this fundamental aspect , creating and manipulating of entangled states are essential for quantum information applications . among these applications",
    "are quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , and quantum computational speedups @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , and quantum positioning and clock synchronization @xcite .",
    "hence , quantum entanglement has been viewed as an essential resource for quantum information processing .",
    "all of these applications depend upon the strength of quantum entanglement .",
    "if the cloning process applied to entangled subsystems is to be anything more than a basic curiosity , and is to find a practical application in the field of quantum information theory , it should be possible to obtain not only maximally accurate copies of the original state , but also copies which preserve entangling characteristic of the original state when the input state is an entangled state .",
    "masiak and knight @xcite have shown that copies of entangled pair of qubits can be generated by using the uqcm . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the degree to which entanglement survives when a three qubit entangled state is copied by using local and non - local processes , respectively .",
    "we will show how these copying processes degrade quantum entanglement due to a residual correlation between the copied output and the copying machine .",
    "we will also show that entanglement is rapidly destroyed by the copying process .",
    "we consider quantum copying of a non - local state of a three - particle system consisting of a three qubits and assume that the three qubits are initially prepared in a entangled pure state expressed by @xmath0    there are two approaches to realize quantum copying of the above entangled state .",
    "the first one is that each of the three original qubits is copied separately by using three different local copying machines .",
    "the second method is that the entangled state of the three qubits is treated as a state in a large hilbert space and copied as a whole .",
    "the former is called as local cloning while the latter is regarded as non - local cloning .",
    "we will measure quantum entanglement in a three - particle system by making use of the entanglement tensor approach which is first proposed in ref . @xcite and further developed for a three - particle system by present authors @xcite .",

    "this inter - two - particle entanglement amplification in a three - particle system is originated from inter - two - particle , and particle - copier interaction .",
    "however , inter - three - qubit entanglement can not be amplified for both local and nonlocal cloning processes .",
    "hence this does not violate the well known fact that copying a quantum system does not increase the information obtainable about the originals .    finally , it is interesting to compare the fidelity @xmath61 of the output density operator after local copying relative to @xmath39 with the fidelity @xmath62 of the output density operator after non - local copying relative to @xmath39 .",

    "3 it can be seen that the fidelity in the non - local cloning process is always greater than that in the local cloning process , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the output state after non - local copying is closer to the original state than the output state after local copying .",
    "we can see from the previous section that both local and non - local copying are not rather efficient process from the point of view of preserving entanglement . even in the case",
    "when the maximally inseparable state , i.e. ghz state where @xmath36 , is the input state of the cloning process , only a small amount of entanglement survives the cloning .",
    "it is an interesting question to ask what will happen when the output state of the copier is used as an input state in the next step of a sequence of cloning process . in particular",
    ", we are interested in discovering how fast the entanglement decreases when the copying is iterated .",
    "we restrict ourself in the case of non - local cloning , because this scheme is much more effective as we saw above , and results obtained in this case can be treated as an upper bound for all other schemes .",
    "the final state of the copying process is a mixed state , described by the density matrix , eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "this density matrix can not be used directly as input data in computations , because the non - local copying scheme works straightforwardly only when an input state is initially in a pure , potentially entangled state .",
    "the density matrix should be first converted to a form which allows us to perform the second cloning .",
    "it turns out that a simple diagonalization of the density matrix is sufficient . in this new diagonal basis ,",

    "each vector @xmath72 can be cloned separately .",
    "the mixture of the resultant density matrices taken with the weights @xmath70 is the result of the second cloning process .    as a specific example of iterating copying , in what follows we consider repetition of non - local quantum cloning for the ghz state given by eq .",

    "after the second copying , we arrive at the output state expressed by the following density operator @xmath77 which leads to the following entanglement tensors @xmath78 hence after finishing the second copying , entanglement of the three - qubit system becomes @xmath79    from above calculations we can see that entanglement in the three - qubit system is further reduced after the second copying . repeating the above procedure we can investigate changes in entanglement @xmath1 and @xmath2 at each stage of iterating copy process . in table 1",
    "we show the entanglement measures @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the clones of the maximally entangled ghz state for the case of the first five stages of the cloning . from the this table , we see that the entanglement decreases extremely rapidly , and after just six iterations the copy of the ghz state , the resultant entanglement goes to zero .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated remaining entanglement in quantum copying and iterating quantum copying of a three - qubit system by using the entanglement tensor approach .",
    "specifically , we have studied the remaining inter - two - qubit and inter - three - qubit entanglements in the local and non - local cloning processes , respectively .",
