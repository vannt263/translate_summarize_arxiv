    "linear algebraic equations are foundational for various computation tasks , and systems of linear algebraic equations also arise from various practical engineering problems @xcite . in recent years",
    "much interest has developed in finding out how to solve linear equations using multiple processing units or over a network .",
    "major efforts have been made in the development of parallel or distributed algorithms as linear - equation solvers .",
    "on the one hand one aims at faster algorithms in view of the intuition that multiple processing units working in parallel under smart arrangements might provide significant improvements in computation efficiency . on the other hand various distributed systems induce structure constraints , e.g.",
    ", one node holds one equation and it can not or does not want to share the exact equation with other nodes , a constraint which excludes the feasibility of classical centralized algorithms .",
    "parallel algorithms for linear equations have been developed in the spirit of high - performance computing , e.g. , the jacobi method @xcite , the successive over - relaxations method @xcite , the kaczmarz method @xcite and the randomized iterative method @xcite . in these algorithms ,",
    "the state of each node can give an entry of the solution to a linear equation after a suitably long running time , via successive information exchange with other nodes and parallel independent computing .",
    "there are two restrictions in these parallel algorithms .",
    "the first restriction is that often each node is implicitly required to have access to all the other ones , i.e. , the network graph is naturally complete @xcite .",
    "second , linear equations are restricted in many parallel algorithms .",
    "it is somewhat unsatisfactory that , for example in the jacobi method , a sufficient condition for convergence is that the linear equations must be strictly or irreducibly diagonally dominant .",
    "meanwhile , discrete and continuous - time algorithms for linear equations known to have a unique solution are also established from the point of view of distributed control and optimization .",
    "a variety of distributed algorithms are presented , among which discrete - time algorithms are given by @xcite and continuous - time algorithms are presented in @xcite . in these network",
    "distributed algorithms , compared with the development in parallel computing , each node state asymptotically converges to the solution to the linear equation .",
    "such developments on network linear equations are closely related to , and sometimes even special cases of , the study of distributed optimization methods on nonlinear models @xcite , due to the natural connection between solving equations and optimizing objective functions .",
    "most of the existing work for parallel and distributed algorithms assumes that the linear equations have exact solutions @xcite , or can only produce least square solutions in the approximate sense or for limited graph structures @xcite , and very few results have been obtained on exact distributed least squares solvers for network linear equations . in this paper , distributed continuous and discrete - time algorithms that can compute the least squares solution to a linear equation over a network are presented .",
    "the particular contributions of our work are summarized as follows .    * by recognizing a least - squares problem for a linear equation as a constrained optimization problem over a network , a continuous - time flow is presented in the form of the classical arrow - hurwicz - uzawa flow @xcite , for which we establish necessary and sufficient conditions regarding which graph structures can drive the network flow to agree on the least squares solution . * by euler s method , a discrete - time algorithm is presented and the properties of its convergence are also specified and proved . * comprehensive discussions on the residual vector , an alternative state expansion method , and switching networks are provided .",
    "surprisingly , it can be shown that under a sufficiently fast switching signal , the proposed flow for switching networks becomes an approximate least square solver under which node states are driven to at least a small neighborhood around the least square solution , even if all graphs in the switching signal fail to do so in the absence of structure switching .",
    "the paper begins by the formulating the network linear equations in section [ sec:2 ] , in addition to explaining how the arrow - hurwicz - uzawa flow can be used to derive a continuous - time network flow . in section [ sec:3 ] , a necessary and sufficient condition for the continuous - time flow to converge to the least squares solution",
    "is established , along with its proof and a couple of numerical examples . in section [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "a discrete - time algorithm is obtained by euler s method and the necessary and sufficient conditions for its convergence conditions are established , and a few numerical examples are also given .",
    "in section [ sec:5 ] , we further discuss distributed computation of residual vector , alternative methods of obtaining the least squares solution , and a few numerical examples to study the convergence properties of the continuous - time algorithm over a switching network . finally a few concluding remarks are given in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "consider the following linear algebraic equation with unknown @xmath0 : @xmath1 and where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are known .",
    "denote the column space of a matrix @xmath4 by @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 , then the equation ( [ eq : linear_equation ] ) always has ( one or many ) exact solutions . if @xmath7 , the least squares solution is defined by the solution of the following optimization problem : @xmath8 it is well known that if @xmath9 , then ( [ eq : leastsquare_constaint ] ) yields a unique solution @xmath10 .      denote @xmath11 we can rewrite ( [ eq : linear_equation ] ) as @xmath12 let @xmath13 be a constant , undirected and connected graph with the set of nodes @xmath14 and the set of edges @xmath15 .",
    "each node @xmath16 holds the equation @xmath17 and also holds a vector @xmath18 that varies as a function of time @xmath19 . note that @xmath20 will turn out to be part of the state of node @xmath16 at time @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the set of neighbor nodes that are connected to node @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath22 .",

    "the vector @xmath35 is also held by node @xmath16 , and the @xmath36-dimensional vector @xmath37^\\top$ ] represents the state of node @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the following flow : @xmath38 we term ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) an  oscillation + gradient flow \" because the equation @xmath39 yields oscillating trajectories for @xmath40 , while @xmath41 is a gradient flow .",
    "note that in the flow ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) , the state variable @xmath42^\\top$ ] of node @xmath16 obeys the evolution @xmath43 therefore , besides the equation @xmath17 that node @xmath16 possesses , it only needs to communicate with its neighbors to obtain their states in order to implement ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) .",
    "the flow ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) is _ distributed _ in that sense .",
    "consider a constrained optimization problem as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a differentiable function , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the well - known arrow - hurwicz - uzawa ( a - h - u ) flow introduced in @xcite provides under appropriate conditions a continuous - time solver defined by @xmath48 in particular , if @xmath49 is strictly convex and @xmath50 has full row rank , then ( see @xcite@xcite ) along the flow ( [ eq : wang_model ] ) , @xmath40 will converge to the optimal point of ( [ eq : wang_opt ] ) and @xmath51 will converge to a lagrangian multiplier of ( [ eq : wang_opt ] ) .",
    "as one can see , the flow ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) is a form of the a - h - u flow ( [ eq : wang_model ] ) with the cost function @xmath52 being the given @xmath53 and the constraint @xmath54 given by @xmath55 .",
    "however , neither the laplacian @xmath56 is a full - rank matrix , nor is @xmath53 strictly convex .",
    "therefore , the sufficiency results and analysis for the a - h - u flow established in @xcite can not be applied directly to the flow ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) .      in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "an alternative distributed flow for solving @xmath57 was proposed , where each @xmath58 is a locally lipschitz and convex function known to node @xmath16 only .",
    "viewing the component @xmath59 in @xmath60 as the @xmath61 in ( [ eq : opdistributed ] ) , the wang - elia / gharesifard - corts flow @xcite reads as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a positive number , @xmath64^\\top$ ] and @xmath65 since by direct calculation we know @xmath66 . with fixed interaction graph and suitable choice of @xmath63 ,",
    "the flow ( [ eq : wang - elia - cortes ] ) is a least squares solver for ( [ eq : linear_equation ] ) even for balanced directed networks ( theorem 5.4 , @xcite ) .",
    "the system ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) under consideration in the current work certainly has a simpler structure compared to ( [ eq : wang - elia - cortes ] ) , which is desirable in large - scale applications .",
    "moreover , it is also useful to establish a clear understanding of the convergence conditions of the system ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) under general conditions ( which are currently missing in the literature),the more so considering the historical context .",
    "in this section , we study the behavior of the flow ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) in terms of convergence to a least squares solution for the @xmath20 , and present necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence .",
    "we present the following result .",

    "further @xmath51 along ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) converges to a lagrange multiplier associated with a solution of the optimization problem @xmath74 b.   if there exists @xmath69 such that @xmath75 , then there exist trajectories of @xmath40 along ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) which do not converge .",

    "we rewrite ( [ eq : flowmodel1 ] ) as @xmath79 suppose there exists an equilibrium @xmath80 of ( [ eq : flowmodel2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath81    it is worth noting that ( [ eq : equilib ] ) specifies exactly the karush - kuhn - tucker conditions on @xmath80 for the optimization problem ( [ eq : optproblem_cont ] ) @xcite . since @xmath82 is a convex function and the constraints in ( [ eq : optproblem_cont ] ) are equality constraints , slater s condition holds @xcite .",
