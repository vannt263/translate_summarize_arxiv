    "the present dama / libra @xcite experiment , as the former dama / nai @xcite , has the main aim to investigate the presence of dark matter ( dm ) particles in the galactic halo by exploiting the model independent dm annual modulation signature ( originally suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", they have cumulatively reached a model independent evidence at 9.3 @xmath14 c.l . for the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo on the basis of the exploited dm annual modulation signature @xcite .    in the present work the dama / libra  phase1 data ( total exposure : 1.04 ton @xmath0 yr ) are analysed in terms of possible diurnal variation of the rate of the _ single - hit _ events in low energy regions , both where the dm annual modulation signal is observed ( @xmath15 kev , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) and in the region just above ( @xmath16 kev ) for comparison .",
    "actually a diurnal effect with the sidereal time is expected for dm because of earth rotation . in sect .",
    "2 the diurnal modulation of the dm signal as a function of the sidereal time due to earth rotation velocity contribution will be discussed and some relevant formulae will be presented ; this effect is model - independent and has several requirements as the dm annual modulation effect does . thus , in sect .",
    "4 the data have been analyzed using the sidereal time referred to greenwich , also sometimes called gmst .",
    "since potential environmental backgrounds can be in principle correlated with the solar time , the analysis has been also performed in terms of solar time referred to the lngs site .",
    "let us now introduce an interesting model independent effect which can induce a diurnal variation of the counting rate of the _ single - hit _ events : the diurnal modulation of the dm signal as a function of the sidereal time due to earth rotation velocity contribution @xcite .",
    "as explained below , this effect is linked with the dm model independent annual modulation signature ( see also for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . to explain this point in this section we describe all the components of the motion of a detector placed in a terrestrial laboratory with respect to an observer fixed in the galactic frame , including both the revolution of the earth around the sun and the rotation of the earth around its axis .",
    "as known , the velocity of the detector in the terrestrial laboratory can be expressed as following : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the velocity of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) due to the rotation of the galaxy ; @xmath19 is the sun peculiar velocity with respect to lsr ; @xmath20 is the velocity of the revolution of the earth around the sun and @xmath21 is the velocity of the rotation of the earth around its axis at the latitude and longitude of the laboratory . using the galactic coordinate frame ( that is @xmath22 axis towards the galactic center , @xmath23 axis following the rotation of the galaxy and the @xmath24 axis towards the galactic north pole ) , we have @xmath25 , with @xmath26 km / s @xcite ( uncertainty at 90% c.l . ) , and @xmath27 km / s @xcite , while the revolution and rotation velocities of the earth depend on the sidereal time , @xmath28 .    _ revolution of the earth around the sun .",
    "_ this motion can be easily worked out using the ecliptic coordinate system @xmath29 , where the @xmath30 axis is directed towards the vernal equinox and @xmath30 and @xmath31 lie on the ecliptic plane .",
    "the right - handed convention is used . in the galactic coordinates",
    ", we can write and the @xmath32 of the galactic north pole and of the galactic center ( see also later ) . ] : @xmath33 the ecliptic plane is tilted with respect to the galactic plane by @xmath34 , as @xmath35 .",
    "the motion of the earth in the ecliptic plane can be described as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the orbital velocity of the earth , which has a weak dependence on time due to the ellipticity of the earth orbital motion around the sun ; its value ranges between 29.3 km / s and 30.3 km / s . for most purposes it can be assumed constant and equal to its mean value @xmath38 29.8 km / s . on the other hand , when more accurate calculations are necessary , the routines in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used : they also take into account the ellipticity of the earth orbit and the gravitational influence of other celestial bodies ( moon , jupiter , and etc . ) .",
    "moreover , the phase in eq .",
    "[ eq : velearth2 ] can be written as @xmath39 ; here @xmath40 with @xmath41 = 1 y , @xmath28 is the sidereal time and @xmath42 is the spring equinox time ( @xmath43 march 21 ) .",
    "_ rotation of the earth around its axis . _",
    "the simplest way to express this motion is in the equatorial coordinate system @xmath44 , where the @xmath45 axis is directed towards the vernal equinox and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are on the equatorial plane ; the @xmath47 axis is towards the north pole .",
    "the right - handed convention is used . to work out the galactic coordinates of these versors",
    ", we use the equatorial coordinates of the galactic north pole : @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is the right ascension and @xmath32 is declination ) ; and of the galactic center : @xmath51 and @xmath52 , evaluated at the epoch j2000.0 . in the galactic coordinates",
    ", these versors can be written as : @xmath53 therefore , we can write : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the rotational velocity of the earth at the given latitude , @xmath56 , of the laboratory : @xmath57 .",
    "the equatorial rotational velocity , @xmath58 , is equal to 0.4655 km / s .",
    "hence , at lngs ( @xmath59n and longitude @xmath60e ) : @xmath61 km / s .",
    "the angle @xmath62 , where @xmath63 with @xmath64 = 1 sidereal day .      in most evaluations of dark matter candidates",
    "the expected counting rate depends on the module of the detector s velocity in the galaxy , @xmath66 .",
    "the time - independent contribution is @xmath67 km / s , while a taylor expansion can be performed in the smaller time - dependent contributions @xmath68 km / s and @xmath69 km / s .",
    "thus , to the first order , that reads : @xmath70 the higher order terms with no time dependence and with higher harmonics of @xmath20 : @xmath71 , and the contributions arising from the ellipticity of the earth orbit are omitted for simplicity , having frequencies well separated from the diurnal one .",
    "the second term in eq . [ eq : vlab ] is responsible for the dm annual modulation of the signal and can be written as : @xmath72    defining @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( equal to 0.465 and to 0.149 , respectively , for the case @xmath75 km / s ) , one can write : @xmath76 with @xmath77 , this confirms that the ecliptic is tilted with respect to the galactic plane of @xmath78 , and @xmath79 rad ( both values are calculated for @xmath75 km / s ) .",

    "the sensitive part is made of 25 highly radiopure nai(tl ) crystal scintillators organized in a ( 5 @xmath0 5 ) matrix ; each nai(tl ) detector has 9.70 kg mass and a size of ( @xmath105 ) @xmath106 .",
    "the bare crystals are enveloped in tetratec - teflon foils and encapsulated in radiopure ofhc cu housing . in each detector two 10",
    "cm long special quartz light guides act also as optical windows on the two end faces of the crystal and are coupled to two low background photomultipliers ( pmt ) working in coincidence at single photoelectron level .",
    "the detectors are housed in a sealed low - radioactive copper box installed in the center of a low - radioactive cu / pb / cd - foils / polyethylene / paraffin shield ; moreover , about 1 m concrete ( made from the gran sasso rock material ) almost fully surrounds ( mostly outside the barrack ) this passive shield , acting as a further neutron moderator .",
    "the copper box is maintained in hp nitrogen atmosphere in slightly overpressure with respect to the external environment ; it is part of the threefold - level sealing system which excludes the detectors from the environmental air of the underground laboratory .",
    "the light response of the detectors in dama / libra  phase1 typically ranges from 5.5 to 7.5 photoelectrons / kev , depending on the detector .",
    "the hardware threshold of each pmt is at single photoelectron , while a software energy threshold of 2 kev electron equivalent ( hereafter kev ) is used @xcite .",
    "energy calibration with x - rays/@xmath107 sources are regularly carried out in the same running condition down to few kev @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the whole dama / libra installation is under air conditioning to assure a suitable and stable working temperature for the electronics ; in addition , the huge heat capacity of the multi - ton passive shield ( @xmath108 cal/@xmath109c ) further assures a relevant stability of the detectors operating temperature .",
    "the daq system records both _ single - hit _ events ( where just one of the detectors fires ) and _ multiple - hit _ events ( where more than one detector fire ) up to the mev region despite the optimization is performed for the lowest one . a hardware / software system is operative to monitor the running conditions , and self - controlled computer processes automatically control several parameters and manage alarms . for the radiopurity , the electronic chain , the data acquisition system and for all the other details",

    "phase1 new transient digitizers and daq system have been installed at fall 2008 before the start of the sixth annual cycle .",
