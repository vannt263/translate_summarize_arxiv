    "prior to delineating the terminological parameters for the present analysis of non - standard models of peano arithmetic , the historical and philosophical motivation behind the project must be rendered explicit .",
    "the important background for the development of non - standard models of mathematics , such as non - euclidean geometry , provide a coherent context to discuss the non - standard models of arithmetic developed during the @xmath1 century .",
    "the story of non - euclidean geometry stems from the islamic golden age taking place from the @xmath3 to @xmath4 century@xcite , in which much of the remaining knowledge from babylonian , egyptian , and greek mathematics were compiled by arab scholars .",
    "translations of these writings subsequently spread to europe during the middle ages and provided european mathematicians the foundation to work for centuries on contributing to the growing body of knowledge of mathematics . during the @xmath5 century , seemingly independently@xcite , jnos bolyai and nikolai lobachevsky considered non - standard models of geometry , such as hyperbolic geometry , which challenged the geometry of euclid accepted since antiquity .",
    "non - euclidean geometry was further pursued by bernhard riemann@xcite and led to the development of metric tensors and manifolds which provided the mathematical foundation for albert einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "since the consideration of non - standard models of geometry were successful in providing a coherent framework for generalizing mathematics to such crowning intellectual achievements as general relativity , surely the consideration of non - standard models of arithmetic will lead to important results in the foundations of mathematics as well .    at the time of riemann and einstein , research programs championed by richard dedekind , bertrand russell , david hilbert , and others , led to the investigation of formalized axiomatic systems as a foundation for mathematics@xcite .",
    "one such axiomatic system , known as peano arithmetic , was proposed by the italian mathematician giuseppe peano in his 1889 , `` _ _ arithmetices principia , nova methodo exposita _ _ '' .",
    "peano arithmetic became the paradigmatic axiomatization of arithmetic , and also provided mathematicians with a concrete example of the practical expressiveness of results that can be proved directly from axioms by logic .",
    "furthermore , major paradoxes in naive set theory , such as russell s paradox , required reformulations of entire fields of mathematics ; simultaneously , the philosophical positions of logicism , formalism , and intuitionism on the epistemology and ontology of mathematics began to develop@xcite . yet throughout this burst of activity in the foundations of mathematics , arguably the two most important lines of research to emerge from this period were zermelo - fraenkel set theory and peano arithmetic ; and , starting with cantor , the clarification of the concept of infinity as described by ordinals and the cardinality of sets@xcite .",
    "this paper engages in an analysis of non - standard models of peano arithmetic and the developments in model theory and set theory resulting from the research done during the early and mid @xmath1 century on foundations of mathematics .",
    "the results discussed include the existence of @xmath6 non - standard models of peano arithmetic , overspill , and tennenbaum s theorem .",
    "the first - order language @xmath7 contains a truth - functionally complete set of boolean connectives , equality , existential and universal quantification , an endless supply of variables @xmath8 , brackets , and non - logical symbols for constants , relations and functions .",
    "while there are numerous ways to configure this first - order language , the notion of a structure naturally formulates @xmath7 for useful applications.@xcite    @xmath9 is an @xmath7-structure when @xmath9 subsumes the following ,    1 .",

    "the answer to the first question is that @xmath9 and @xmath47 model @xmath20 in the same way when a type of function @xmath48 is an isomorphism .",

    "furthermore , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are isomorphic , written @xmath67 , when there exists a surjective embedding @xmath52 .",
    "the second question is recapitulated formally as motivation for classifying the properties of standard and non - standard models of peano arithmetic .",
    "given the standard model @xmath46 of @xmath34 , if @xmath43 and @xmath68 , then how many such countable models @xmath9 are there and how do they differ from @xmath46 ?",

    "the use of the gdel - rosser theorem in the context of @xmath34 , the first part of problem 1 raised at the end of the lexicon can be answered by proving that there are @xmath6 non - standard countable models of @xmath34 .",

    "the gdel - rosser theorem is stated without proof , where @xmath111 is @xmath34 without the induction schema.@xcite    ( gdel - rosser theorem ) : let @xmath20 be a recursively axiomatized @xmath70-theory that extends @xmath111 .",

    "<S> throughout the course of mathematical history , generalizations of previously understood concepts and structures have led to the fruitful development of the hierarchy of number systems , non - euclidean geometry , and many other epochal phases in mathematical progress . in the study of formalized theories of arithmetic , it is only natural to consider the extension from the standard model of peano arithmetic , @xmath0 , to non - standard models of arithmetic . the existence of non - standard models of peano arithmetic provided motivation in the early @xmath1 century for a variety of questions in model theory regarding the classification of models up to isomorphism and the properties that non - standard models of peano arithmetic have . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents these questions and the necessary results to prove tennenbaum s theorem , which draws an explicit line between the properties of standard and non - standard models ; namely , that no countable non - standard model of peano arithmetic is recursive . </S>",
    "<S> these model - theoretic results have contributed to the foundational framework within which research programs developed by skolem , rosser , tarski , mostowski and others have flourished . while such foundational topics were crucial to active fields of research during the middle of the @xmath1 century , numerous open questions about models of arithmetic , and model theory in general , </S>",
    "<S> still remain pertinent to the realm of @xmath2 century mathematical discourse . </S>"
