    "eruptive outbursts in young low - mass stars are scarce events that are thought to be the result of increased accretion through a circumstellar disk ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) .",
    "ex  lupi is the prototype of a class of young stars ( termed exors ) showing such outbursts ( herbig 1977 , 1989 , 2007 ) .",
    "it has been observed to exhibit sporadic brightness increases of up to a few magnitudes which typically last a few weeks before fading back to a quiescent state .",
    "such a characteristic outburst occurred in 1993 and was studied spectroscopically by lehmann , reipurth , & brandner ( 1995 ) and herbig et al .",
    "in contrast to these smaller characteristic outbursts , ex  lup was observed in 1955 to exhibit a larger outburst resulting in an optical brightness increase of @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "this event , which we herein term an extreme outburst , was until recently unique in the photometric annals of ex  lup .",
    "however , in early 2008 a second such event took place .",
    "since it is unclear whether extreme outbursts are initiated by the same physical mechanism as their smaller more frequent counterparts , the advent of the 2008 eruption presented us with the opportunity to perform a detailed observational study of an extreme outburst .",
    "below , we present the results of this investigation utilizing high spectral resolution optical ( keck  i / hires ) and near - ir ( keck  ii / nirspec ) observations .",
    "observations of ex  lup ( 16:03:05.5 ,  40:18:25 ,  j2000 ) were made on the keck  i and ii 10-meter telescopes on ut 2008 january 23 ( j23 ) , 2008 february 23 ( f23 ) , and 2008 may 23 ( m23 ) .",
    "two instruments were used : hires ( vogt et al . 1994 ) on keck  i and nirspec on keck  ii ( mclean et al .",
    "optical high - resolution spectra were obtained with hires on j23 and m23 .",
    "on j23 , the hiresr configuration was used with the kv380 filter and a slit width of 0@xmath7861 resulting in a spectral resolution of r@xmath148,000 ( i.e. a velocity resolution of @xmath17  km  s@xmath6 ) and a wavelength coverage of @xmath138508350   .",
    "on m23 , the hiresb configuration was used with the wg335 filter and the same slit resulting in a similar spectral resolution and a wavelength coverage of @xmath135006300   .",
    "we are greatly indebted to g.h .",
    "herbig for making the j23 hires spectra available .",
    "near - ir ( nir ) high - resolution spectra ( r@xmath118,000 , velocity resolution @xmath117  km  s@xmath6 ) were obtained with nirspec on f23 and m23 .",
    "fig .  [ lc ] shows the optical light curves of ex  lup over the 1955 ( top ) , 1993 ( middle ) , and 2008 ( bottom ) outbursts , taken from the aavso database .",
    "the 2008 outburst plot shows that the j23 hires observations were acquired soon after the extreme outburst occurred , some 8  days after we had been notified of the event ( a.  jones , private communication to g.h .",
    "herbig ) and while the source was still in a rapid brightening phase with m@xmath810.5 or @xmath13.5 magnitudes brighter than in quiescence ( m@xmath914 ) .",
    "our first nirspec observations were taken one month later when ex  lup had passed its peak brightness of m@xmath98 and had m@xmath99.5 .",
    "our second set of hires and nirspec observations were taken simultaneously three months later ( m23 ) , during the relatively constant plateau phase of the outburst which lasted @xmath1170  days . at this time ex",
    "lup had m@xmath910.2 and was close to the start of a period of instability , about two months prior to the sharp decline back to quiescence .",
    "we note that both the 1955 and 2008 extreme outbursts lasted approximately the same length of time although they are somewhat different in behavior ; the 1955 eruption started slowly and built up to a maximum ( after @xmath1160  days ) while the 2008 event appeared to have a more rapid rise to maximum .",
    "the light curve suggests that the 1993 event was a smaller characteristic outburst .      in fig .",
    "[ hires1 ] we show three wavelength regions from the j23 hires spectrum , selected to cover important atomic features , specifically , h@xmath10 ( 4861.3    top ) , ( 5875.7   ) and ( 5890.0 and 5895.9    middle ) , and ( 6678.2   ) and ( 6707.8    bottom ) .",
    "all but are seen in emission ( which is seen in absorption ) . and h@xmath10 both possess blue - shifted absorption , with the emission lines being broad ( full width 10% intensity @xmath1750  km  s@xmath6 ) and the blue - shifted absorption removing flux well below the continuum with a minimum at @xmath1120  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the blue - shifted absorption on h@xmath10 appears smooth with one broad minimum at 115  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "similarly , the blue - shifted absorption on the d lines have minima at 129 and 122  km  s@xmath6 , respectively . , feii , and all exhibit composite profiles made up of both broad and narrow emission components ( bc and nc , respectively ; hamann & persson 1992 ) .",
    "the nc and bc peaks lie within @xmath110  km  s@xmath6 of their rest wavelength .",
    "four months after the first hires observation , on m23 ( see fig .",
    "[ hires2 ] ) , much of the same spectral structure was still visible although some changes appeared to have occurred .",
    "the line still possessed nc and bc features although the radial velocity offset of the nc from the line rest wavelength had shifted to the blue .",
    "also , the h@xmath10 profile had changed and exhibited a double peak at 77 and + 100  km  s@xmath6 with an absorption minimum at + 42  km  s@xmath6 . however , the width of the h@xmath10 emission was similar to that found four months previously .",
    "the profiles of the d lines were also quite different and became somewhat more complex .",
    "both lines remained in emission and possessed blue - shifted absorption components although the latter were much weaker than in the j23 spectra .",
    "additionally , the blue - shifted absorptions showed radial velocity structure ( see fig .",
    "[ hires2 ] ) extending to 277  km  s@xmath6 on m23 and 212  km  s@xmath6 on j23 . finally , superimposed on both of the broad emission lines",
    "were narrow absorption features with a radial velocity offset of 4  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we have performed a best fit to the nc and bc structures present in and using a two - component gaussian emission profile model , iterating over three parameters for both gaussians , specifically , the wavelength of peak emission ( @xmath11 ) , the peak flux ( f@xmath12 ) , and the gaussian fwhm .",

    ", results from both observing dates ( f23 and m23 ) are plotted for the regions covering br@xmath15 at 2.166  @xmath0 m ( top - left ) and the v=20 co overtone bandhead at 2.2935  @xmath0 m ( top - right ) .",
    "the bottom - left plot covers the doublet lines at 2.206 and 2.208  @xmath0",

    "the br@xmath15 line appears very similar in j23 and m23 with a ew(br@xmath15 ) of 17   .",
    "it is broad ( fwhm@xmath1220  km  s@xmath6 on f23 , 190  km  s@xmath6 on m23 ) , and is slightly red - shifted with the @xmath11 emission offset by + 5 and + 32  km  s@xmath6 on f23 and m23 , respectively .",
    "the doublet lines are also broad with fwhm of 177 and 155  km  s@xmath6 on the one date they were observed .",
    "the most striking change occurs in the spectral region containing the 2.2935  @xmath0 m v=2 - 0 co overtone bandhead . in the data from f23 ,",
    "the bandhead is strongly in emission with a ew(co )  =  21   and exhibits the characteristic signature of being significantly velocity broadened ( i.e. a blue - hump is present , see for example wl  16 in carr et al .",
    "1993 ) . in the data from m23 , however , the emission is only barely seen ( ew(co )  =  4   ) although velocity broadening of the bandhead still seems to be present . in the bottom - right plot of fig .",
    "[ nirspec1 ] we have modeled the co bandhead emission profile using the analysis from dent & geballe ( 1991 ) and carr & tokunaga ( 1992 ) previously employed in aspin , reipurth , & lehmann ( 1994 ) and aspin & greene ( 2007 ) .",
    "the details of the model are presented in the aforementioned papers and , for brevity , here we merely present our findings .",
    "the co bandhead emission is best fitted using a velocity profile originating in a circumstellar disk .",
    "this produces a good fit to the blue - hump and the overall shape of the bandhead .",
    "we investigated a wide range of the model free parameters , specifically stellar mass ( m@xmath16 ) over the range 0.12.0  m@xmath3 , the emission region temperature ( t@xmath17 ) from 1500 to 6000  k , the optical depth of co ( @xmath18 ) from 0.01 to 5.0 , and the inner ( r@xmath19 ) and outer ( r@xmath20 ) gas disk radii between 1.0@xmath410@xmath21 and 1.0@xmath410@xmath22  m ( i.e. @xmath11.4140  r@xmath16 or 0.0070.7  au ) .",

    "typical associated uncertainties on these values should be considered to be @xmath120% . for this value of r@xmath19 and with r@xmath16  =  1.6  r@xmath3 ( as estimated by gras - velzquez & ray 2005 and sipos et al .",
    "2010 ) , gas at 2500  k would require a heating source on the stellar surface of @xmath18000  k similar to what was found for surface accretion shocks in , for example , v1647  ori ( briceo et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the keplerian velocity at 0.08  au for m@xmath16  =  0.6  m@xmath3 is @xmath180  km  s@xmath6 . due to the complex relationship between the model free parameters ,",
    "the uniqueness of the above best - fit model is unclear .",
    "however , we believe that our investigation of the aforementioned free - parameter space results in values for the above physical properties that are reasonable for this star .",
    "the 2008 extreme outburst of ex  lup appears to be unlike any other observed in this source since 1955 .",
    "both extreme outbursts exhibited very large optical brightness increases ( 56 magnitudes ) and , although information about the earlier event is scarce they appear , at least superficially , to be quite similar . between 1955 and 2008 ,",
    "ex  lup has undergone numerous smaller characteristic outbursts with @xmath25m@xmath26 typically 13  magnitudes .",
    "the durations of the extreme and characteristic events appear very different ; the former last 200 + days whereas the latter last perhaps only a few weeks ( see the aavso archive for more details ) .",
    "photometrically , therefore , there seems to be an inherent difference between extreme and characteristic outbursts .",
    "the hires spectra of ex  lup taken between 1998 and 2004 ( presented in herbig 2007 ) and covering both the quiescent state and the characteristic outburst phases , showed narrow emission features together with an underlying atomic and molecular absorption spectrum typical of an @xmath1m0 dwarf star . during the 2008 extreme outburst",
    ", however , the hires spectra appeared markedly different with no obvious sign of an underlying photosphere .",
    "comparing our data taken during the 2008 extreme outburst ( shown in figs .",
    "[ hires1 ] and [ hires2 ] ) with previous observations we find that whereas herbig et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found strong emission lines of h  i , , i , and with no evidence for blue - shifted absorption nor and lines , we observe both . also",
    ", the characteristic outburst phase spectrum from lehmann , reipurth & brandner ( 1995 ) possessed , , , , lines together with weak lines , exhibiting inverse p  cygni ( ipc ) profiles ( red - shifted absorption ) on , and perhaps even which disappeared around 7 weeks later .",
    "herbig ( 1950 ) noted that ipc profiles were also present in his 1949/1950 spectrograms taken several years before the earlier extreme outburst .",
    "lehmann et al .",
    "( 1995 ) interpreted these ipc profiles as originating in cool infalling gas .",
    "our hires spectra , which shows blue - shifted absorption , suggest that we are observing the opposite , i.e. cool outflowing gas .",
    "we speculate that perhaps it is only during extreme outbursts that strong and dense enough stellar / disk winds are generated to create the blue - shifted absorption component .    two - component ( bc and nc ) emission line profiles , similar to the ones seen in our 2008 ex  lup spectra , were previously reported on the stronger and ti  ii lines in ex  lup in data taken in june 1998 ( herbig 2007 ) .",
    "another young t  tauri star to show such structure is dr  tau ( beristain , edwards , & kwan 1998 ) .",
    "the interpretation suggested for this source was that the nc of the lines arose in a compact region close to the stellar surface ( and hence not significantly rotationally broadened ) as in a post - shock region at the base of an accretion flow .",
    "the bc was considered to originate in a region with considerable radial velocity structure such as in a magnetospheric accretion funnel or in the hot inner region of the circumstellar disk .",
    "the different excitation requirements for ( e@xmath27=23  ev ) and ( e@xmath27=56  ev ) suggests that these lines are created in different physical locations , making the similarity of structure somewhat peculiar . any model proposed to explain the formation of these lines and the creation of the nc+bc structure would need to explain this energy discrepancy together with the temporal changes observed between j23 and m23 i.e. _ i ) _ a decline in the strength ( i.e. ew ) of the nc by a factor 2 coupled with a @xmath140% increase in the bc strength , _ ii ) _ a @xmath120% increase in the strength of the nc coupled with an unchanged bc strength , and _",
    "iii ) _ the changes in kinematic properties ( e.g. fwhm , radial velocity offset ) shown in fig .  [ heifeii ] .",
    "the changes in the blue - shifted absorption profiles between j23 and m23 suggest that the wind from ex  lup evolved between the two observations .",
    "the blue - shifted absorption features present on j23 and seen in the h , na , and ca lines , varied somewhat differently for each element . between j23 and m23 , _",
    "i ) _ the blue - shifted h@xmath10 absorption moved redward and , in fact , became somewhat red - shifted , _",
    "ii ) _ the blue - shifted absorption disappeared , and _",
    "iii ) _ the deep and broad single component blue - shifted absorption on the lines became shallower and more complex in structure , and extended to much higher radial velocities .",
    "a sophisticated radiative transfer code is required to model such variations .",
    "the changes in the co overtone bandhead observed between j23 and m23 , together with the modeling presented above , suggest that the hot gas in the inner regions of the accretion disk either cooled significantly between the two dates , or was mostly accreted onto the star , or the uv photoexcitation conditions changed ( see brittain , najita , & carr 2009 ) .",
    "the unchanged br@xmath15 flux over this period implies strong on - going accretion .",
    "on j23 , f23 , and m23 , ex  lup had m@xmath28 values of 10.5 , 9.5 , and 10.2 , respectively .",
    "juhasz et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) measured the k - band magnitude of ex  lup to be m@xmath29=7.5 on ut  2008  april  20 .",
    "on that date ex  lup had a v magnitude of @xmath19.5 and hence a v  k=2.0 . if we assume this v ",
    "k value for f23 and m23 then on those dates m@xmath29 was 7.5 and 8.2 , respectively ( a mean of 7.85 ) .",
    "the br@xmath15 emission line fluxes therefore decreased by 2@xmath4 between j23 and m23 since on both dates the ew of br@xmath15 was 17   . if the optical continuum emission and the hydrogen line fluxes are indicative of the mass accretion rate ( e.g. gullbring et al .",
    "1998 ; muzerolle , calvet , & hartmann 1998 ; muzerolle , hartmann , & calvet 1998 ) then the accretion rate changed by only a factor 2 over this four month period .",
    "we can convert line and continuum luminosities to accretion luminosity ( l@xmath30 ) to estimate the mass accretion rate ( m ) .",
    "following aspin , beck , & reipurth ( 2008 ) and adopting m@xmath31=7.85 , a flux corresponding to zeroth magnitude at 2.2  @xmath0 m of 4.35@xmath410@xmath32  w  m@xmath33  @xmath0m@xmath6 ( tokunaga & vacca 2005 ) , a visual extinction a@xmath80 , r@xmath19=17  r@xmath16 ( see above ) , l@xmath16=0.5  l@xmath3 ( derived from t@xmath16=3800  k and r@xmath16=1.6  r@xmath3 , again see above ) , and a distance of 140@xmath220  pc ( hughes et al .",
    "1993 ) , we obtain values of l@xmath30  1.6@xmath20.6  l@xmath3 and m=1.5@xmath20.5@xmath410@xmath5  m@xmath3   yr@xmath6 . following valenti et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and gullbring et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the change in optical continuum emission in extreme outburst ( @xmath25v=4.5 magnitudes ) is converted into l@xmath342.3  l@xmath3 and @xmath352.1@xmath410@xmath5  m@xmath3  yr@xmath6 .",
    "we therefore adopt extreme outburst values of l@xmath30=2@xmath20.5  l@xmath3 and m=2@xmath20.5@xmath410@xmath5  m@xmath3   yr@xmath6 .",
