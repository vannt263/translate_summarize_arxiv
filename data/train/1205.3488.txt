    "the kinetic energy is about 0.6% of the bolometric luminosity of the quasar , meaning that the observed outflow is more likely to be powered by the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "here we show that this observational result is a strong confirmation of the theoretical models presented in v11 .",
    "in fact , in all of the evolutionary scenarios that successfully reproduce the observed properties of j1148 , the outflow rate at @xmath3 is largely dominated by the agn and it is consistent with the observed lower limit .    in what follows , we adopt a lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath44cdm ) cosmology with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48  km / s / mpc .",

    "the fir luminosity estimated for j1148 ( see table [ tab : j1148 ] ) gives a sfr @xmath64 m@xmath2yr ( bertoldi et al .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the inferred sfr would be about an order of magnitude lower ( @xmath65 m@xmath2yr ) if the schmidt - kennicutt law is instead adopted ( dwek et al 2007 ; li et al .",
    "2008 ; v11 ) . in this work",
    "we have further revised the sfr inferred from the observations , by taking into account the different imfs adopted in our models and we rescale the @xmath61 conversion factor for a larson imf with @xmath66 m@xmath12 ( standard imf models ) and @xmath67 m@xmath12 ( top - heavy imf ) . with this correction",
    "we obtain star formation rates @xmath68 to @xmath69 times lower , more specifically : sfr @xmath70m@xmath2yr , for a standard imf , and sfr @xmath71 m@xmath12/yr , for a top - heavy imf .",
    "these values are still consistent with results quoted in previous works ( maiolino et al . 2005 ; dwek et al . 2007 ; li et al . 2008 ) .",
    "yet , as discussed in v11 , we use these values as an upper limit to the effective rate of star formation in j1148 , since the active quasar itself may give a non negligible contribution to dust heating ( bianchi , valiante & schneider in preparation ) .",
    "the quiescent and bursted sfhs for the four selected models are shown in the left panels of figures [ fig : out_std ] and [ fig : out_th ] .",
    "in gamete / qsodust , galactic outflows can be driven by sn explosions and by the agn .",
    "both stellar and quasar feedback are consistently modelled in the form of energy - driven winds sweeping the surrounding material away from the galaxy .",
    "the total gas outflow rate is given by @xmath72 , with : @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the escape velocity of the galaxy , @xmath76 is the sn explosion rate , @xmath77 is the bh gas accretion rate , @xmath78 is the radiative efficiency , fixed to be 0.1 and @xmath79 is the average supernova explosion energy , assumed to be @xmath80 erg for pisne and @xmath81 erg for core collapse sne .",
    "the efficiency of sn - winds ( @xmath82 ) has been calibrated by the chemical evolution model applied to the milky way and its dwarf satellites ( salvadori et al .",

    "the right panels of figures [ fig : out_std ] and [ fig : out_th ] show the redshift evolution of the gas outflow rate predicted by the selected models , as labelled in the figures , by showing the separate contribution of sne and the quasar .",
    "as it can be seen from these figures , for @xmath85 the qso outflow rate exceeds by more than two orders of magnitude the sn outflow rate in all the different models .",

    "( 2012 ) . with this large outflow rate",
    ", the host galaxy should be rapidly cleared of its gas content and star formation should be quenched .",
    "indeed , the predicted sfrs systematically show a down - turn at redshifts @xmath86 , when the effect of the quasar - driven wind on the evolution of the ism gas mass becomes dramatic ( see blue lines in figures [ fig : chemevo ] ) .",
    "such a decline is reflected also into the sn rate and , therefore , in the sn - driven outflow rate , which is orders of magnitude lower than the quasar - driven one .",
    "the formulation adopted in v11 for the bh accretion rate ensures that the quasar feedback is active over almost the entire lifetime of the host halo .",
    "this feedback results into efficient gas ejection at @xmath87 , when the bh mass and accretion rate are higher ( see v11 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "in this work , we have shown that the formation history of smbh at the center of high redshift quasars is strongly linked to the properties of their host galaxies .",
    "we use a state - of - the - art model ( v11 ) that allows us to simulate a large number of independent hierarchical histories of quasar host galaxies , following at the same time the star formation histories , chemical evolution , and the gradual build - up of the nuclear black hole by mergers and gas accretion .",
    "we have recently applied this numerical model to one of the most distant quasars , sdss j1148 at @xmath0 and we have shown that the joint constraints provided by the dynamical , gas , and dust masses together with the mass of the nuclear smbh , allow to reconstruct the star formation histories and the nature of the dominant stellar populations in these systems . _ a robust prediction of these models is that the evolution of the nuclear black hole and of the host galaxy are tightly coupled by quasar feedback in the form of strong galaxy - scale winds . _    the recent detection of broad wings in the [ cii]158@xmath39 m line associated to sdss j1148 by maiolino et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , is a strong evidence of clear quasar feedback in the early universe .",
    "the comparison between model predictions and observational data shows that the gas outflow rates predicted by the models are fully consistent with the lower limit ( @xmath1 m@xmath2yr ) inferred from the observations . in addition , it lends strong support to the interpretation that the dominant driving mechanism is quasar feedback .",
    "according to the physical prescriptions and parameter values adopted in the models presented here , the outflow rate has already significantly affected the gas content of the galaxy , leading to a down - turn in the star formation rate at @xmath4 .",
    "it is important to stress that the theoretical findings have been derived independently , well before the observations .",
    "therefore , strong quasar feedback has been a natural by - product of models that have been identified to reproduce the observed dynamical and chemical properties of the host galaxy . in all models ,",
    "the sn rate is constrained by the sfr inferred by the observations and by the chemical properties of the host galaxy .",
    "the associated sn - wind efficiency has been calibrated using the same chemical evolution model to reproduce the global properties of the milky way galaxies ( salvadori et al . 2008 ) .",
    "to be at least comparable with the observed outflow rate , the sn wind efficiency should be higher by @xmath88 orders of magnitude .",
    "there are no physical motivations to justify such an enormous efficiency .",
    "all the proposed scenarios , i.e. different combinations of sfhs and imfs , provide consistent results for the quasar - driven gas ejection rate .",
    "thus , the recent observation reported by maiolino et al .",
    "( 2012 ) does not help to break the degeneracy between the proposed models : accurate observations of the stellar mass are necessary to further constrain the properties of the j1148 host galaxy therefore helping in the identification of the most appropriate imf and sfh .    finally , the comparison of our predicted gas outflow rate with that observed for j1148 by maiolino et al .",
    "( 2012 ) allow us to put additional constraints on the mass of the dm halo hosting the smbh . with a dm halo mass equal to @xmath89 ,",
    "both the bh accretion and feedback efficiencies need to be reduced in order to reproduce the observed bh and gas masses at @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , a smaller dm halo mass implies a reduced gas mass available at each redshift along the hierarchical history . as a result , the final outflow rate is more than one order of magnitude smaller than for the reference model with dm halo mass of @xmath90 and inconsistent with the observed lower limit .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for useful comments and suggestions .",

    "<S> , we show that the gas outflow rate predicted by gamete / qsodust is in good agreement with the lower limit of @xmath1 m@xmath2yr inferred by the observations . according to the model , </S>",
    "<S> the observed outflow at @xmath3 is dominated by quasar feedback , as the outflow rate has already considerably depleted the gas content of the host galaxy , leading to a down - turn in the star formation rate at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we predict that supernova explosions give a negligible contribution to the observed winds at @xmath0 .    </S>",
