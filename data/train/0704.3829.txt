    "the concept of the topological order recently is widely interesting the condensed matter physicists because it may describe the different phases without breaking any global continuous symmetry of the system @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the conventional order related to the symmetry of the system in landau s phase transition theory , the topological order of quantum states is not well defined yet .",
    "for example , in the quantum hall effects , the topological property of the quantum stats may be reflected by the filling factor of the landau level which may be thought as a topological index , the first chern number in magnetic brilliouin zone @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , only the first chern number can not fully score the topological order of the quantum hall states . in a given filling factor",
    ", the quasiparticles may obey either abelian or non - abelian statistics . on the other hand",
    ", the edge state may partially image the topological properties of the bulk state @xcite . in quantum hall system",
    ", it was seen that the edge state may be described by a conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "thus , according to the bulk - edge correspondence due to the gauge invariance , it shows that the bulk state is determined by a chern - simons topological field theory @xcite .",
    "however , the bridge between the microscopic theory of the two - dimensional electron gas and the chern - simons theory was not spanned .",
    "kitaev recently constructed an exactly soluble spin model in a honeycomb lattice @xcite . using a majorana fermion representation",
    ", he found the quantum state space is characterized by two different topological phases even there is not any global symmetry breaking .",
    "the a phase is a gapped phase which has a zero spectral chern number and the vortex excitations obey abelian anyonic statistics .",
    "the b phase is gapless at special points of brilliouin zone .",
    "when the b phase is gapped by a perturbation , it is topologically non - trivial and has an odd - integer spectral chern number .",
    "( we call the gapless b phase the b1 phase and gapped one the b2 phase . )",
    "kitaev showed that if the spectral chern number is odd , there must be unpaired majorana fermions and then the vortex excitations obey non - abelian statistics .",
    "consistent with the non - abelian statistics , the fusion rules of the superselection sectors of kitaev model are the same as those of the ising model . however , the source of the non - abelian physics has not been clearly revealed yet . on the other hand",
    ", the first chern number can only relate to an abelian group and therefore , an odd spectral chern number leads to a non - abelian physics but an even one did not is topologically hard to be understood .",
    "although kitaev model has a very special spin coupling , its very attractive properties caused a bunch of recent studies @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to understand kitaev model if one can map this model to a familiar model .",
    "in fact , kitaev model may be mapped into a special @xmath1-wave paired bcs state if only the vortex - free sector of the model is considered @xcite .",
    "we recently generalized kitaev model to an exactly soluble model whose vortex - free part is equivalent to @xmath2-wave paired fermion states with tunable pairing order parameters @xmath3 on a square lattice . @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of our model has the same shape as that of kitaev model , i.e , the boundary of the a - b phases are corresponding to the points @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the first brilliouin zone .",
    "the a phase is gapped and may be identified as the strong paring phase of the @xmath1-wave paired state @xcite .",
    "the b phase can be either gapped or gapless even if t - symmetry is broken .",
    "we find that gapless excitations in the b phase , i.e. , the b1 phase , is protected by a generalized inversion ( g - inversion ) symmetry under @xmath6 and the emergence of a gapped b(b2 ) phase is thus tied to g - inversion symmetry breaking .",
    "for instance , the @xmath7 wave paired state is gapped while @xmath8-wave paired state is gapless although they both break the t - symmetry .",
    "the critical states of the a - b phase transition remains gapless whether or not t- and g - inversion symmetries are broken , indicative of its topological nature . indeed , if all @xmath3 are tuned to zero , the topological a - b phase transition is from a band insulator to a free fermi gas .",
    "the fermi surface shrinks to a point zero at criticality .    in this paper",
    ", we further generalize the model proposed by the present author and wang in ref .",
    "@xcite to a model whose square lattice mapping includes a next nearest hopping of the spinless fermions . in this case , the a phase is still a strong pairing phase as before .",
    "however , the b2 phase has more fruitful structure .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry is broken even if the chemical potential and the pairing parameters vanish .",
    "near the long wave length limit ( @xmath9 critical line ) , the effective chemical potential has the different sign from that of the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude .",
    "near other two critical lines @xmath10 and @xmath11 , when the next nearest neighbor amplitude is positive , the effective chemical potential is also positive .",
    "when the next nearest neighbor amplitude is negative , the effective chemical potential is also negative .",
    "a positive chemical potential corresponds to a closed fermi surface of the particles and then a pfaffian of the particles while a negative chemical potential to a closed fermi surface of holes and then an anti - pfaffian of the holes of the spinless fermion .",
    "therefore , a pfaffian / anti - pfaffian phase transition happens in the b2 phase .",
    "this pfaffian / anti - pfaffian phase transition has been seen in the context of the @xmath12 fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the model we present here is exactly the same as a toy model on square lattice to study the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian physics @xcite .",
    "the b1 and b2 phases when the next nearest neighbor hopping is absent are corresponding to the particle - hole symmetry is conserved or spontaneously broken .",
    "the another topic of this paper is trying to reveal the mathematical connotation behind the topological order .",
    "we emphasize that there is a hidden su(2 ) gauge symmetry in this model if the model is represented by majorana fermion operators .",
    "this non - abelian gauge symmetry is the source of the non - abelian physics of the model .",
    "the non - abelian degrees of freedom in the a phase are confined while in the b2 phase , the non - abelian degrees of freedom are deconfined .",
    "there is a wess - zumino(zw ) term for su(2)/@xmath13 group whose lever @xmath14 may character the confinement - deconfinement phases .",
    "a level @xmath14 wz term corresponds to a level @xmath14 su(2)/@xmath13 chern - simons topological field theory .",
    "it was known that @xmath15 theory can only have abelian anyon while @xmath16 theory includes non - abelian anyons @xcite .",
    "a recently proved index theorem in 2 + 1 dimensions shows that the sum of this wz term and a reduced eta - invariant @xmath17 is an integer @xcite .",
    "we show that difference between the wz term and a part of the eta - invariant gives an ambiguity of the wz term .",
    "another part of this eta - invariant is identical to the chiral central charge , a half of the spectral chern number .",
    "thus , an odd chern number corresponds to a @xmath18 ambiguity while an even chern number to a @xmath19 ambiguity . according to the bulk - edge correspondence ,",
    "the former is consistent with @xmath16 while the latter is consistent with @xmath15 .",

    "this model is exactly solvable if one uses a majorana fermion representation for spin .",

    "the first term in ( [ 3oi ] ) determines the bulk state topological properties and the latter two terms reflect the boundary topological properties . that the index @xmath277 is an integer determines the bulk - boundary correspondence",
    "now , the index theorem reads @xmath287 the integrity of @xmath288 requires @xmath289 dai and zhang have thought @xmath290 as an intrinsic form of the wz term @xcite and then @xmath291 is in fact an ambiguity of the wz term .",
