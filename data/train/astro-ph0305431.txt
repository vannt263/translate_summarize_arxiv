    "the efforts made in the last three decades to build large samples of ultra steep spectrum ( uss ) radio sources have been justified by a supposed high efficiency of this tecnique to select very distant galaxies .",
    "its effectiveness derives from a combination of the ( high ) redshift of the source with an intrinsic steepening of the radio spectrum at high frequencies . in practice , distant sources with concave radio spectra , will have steeper spectral indices than similar sources at low redshift .",
    "it has been demonstrated ( tielens et al .",
    "1979 , blumenthal & miley 1979 ) that the introduction of a radio spectrum steepness criterium implied a large decrease of the fraction of object with optical counterparts identified on the poss - i ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this was consistent with the steeper spectrum sources being , on average , at high redshifts .",
    "surveys at low frequencies ( @xmath14mhz ) are particularly efficient in selecting radiogalaxies and have at least two benefits .",
    "one is that quasars contribute by no more than @xmath15 to the total number counts ; the second is that most of the detected energy arises from the radio - lobes with negligible contribution from the sources cores , where doppler boosting can play an important role . in principle , as differential sources counts at @xmath16mhz show an excess over the euclidean prediction in the range @xmath17jy , a survey with such limiting fluxes should provide an unbiased sample of objects and a high fraction of high - redshift radiogalaxies ( henceforth hzrgs ) as well .",
    "the difficulty in picking - up these object arises from the large number of candidates to be targeted at optical ; given the low intrinsic fraction of high - z objects in a radio survey , the majority of the targets will reveal to be unwanted foreground objects .",
    "it is thus of fundamental importance to introduce some kind of bias to reduce the number of hzrgs candidates .    in low - frequency radio surveys ( @xmath18mhz ) , the extragalactic sources with steep spectra ( @xmath19 ) are a small fraction of the total , typically no more than @xmath20% , and this fraction lowers down to @xmath21% if more drastic cuts ( @xmath22 ) are adopted . starting from large unbiased radio catalogs is thus essential to build - up conspicuous samples of uss sources . selecting uss sources",
    "implies that the imaging / spectroscopic optical follow - up work is limited to a relatively small number of candidates , giving us higher chances of success .",
    "in addition , radio searches are not affected by dust / obscurement effects , contrarily to what happens with pure optical searches .",
    "the drawback is that the resulting sample may be not representative of the entire population of the high - z objects , since studies conducted on complete samples of classical double sources ( blundell et al .",
    "1999 ) showed that sources with steep spectra at low frequencies tend to be smaller and more powerful with respect to sources with normal spectra . with the advent of the new all - sky surveys ( wenss , nvss , first ) ,",
    "unprecedently deep and large uss samples have been selected ( de breuck et al . 2000 ) , either to increase the number stastistics and to detect intrinsically fainter sources .",
    "these surveys virtually should have pushed the steep spectrum tecnique to its limit , in the sense that they are deep enough for any agn class object to be detected even at the highest redshifts ( @xmath23 ) . nevertheless , despite much",
    "has been published about the radio surveys and the properties of the uss sources , very few claims do exist about the real effectiveness of this tecnique in selecting hzrgs . the temptative estimate given by some authors ( van breugel et al .",
    "1997 ) , though quite realistic , resulted from such a mix of radio / optical / nir biases that makes it impossible to disentangle the role of the radio spectrum steepness itself .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the properties of the existing samples of uss sources are resumed in sect .",
    "2 and the procedure used to derive a quantitative estimate of the real effectiveness of the uss tecnique is described in sect.3 .",
    "conclusions are summarized in sect.4 .",
    "up to now many uss samples have been selected , as many groups started extensive searches for very distant radiogalaxies using the radio - spectrum steepness as a selection criterium . in practice ,",
    "all the existing radio catalogs in the range of frequencies @xmath24mhz have been combined together to build uss sources samples . when building an uss sample , it is common practice to perform a positional cross - correlation of the sources detected in a low - frequency survey with those of a high - frequency one , in order to calculate a two - point spectral index .",
    "the selection frequency plays an important role in determining the efficiency of finding hzrgs .",
    "an outstanding example is the sample of @xmath25 4c sources ( baldwin & scott 1973 ) , whose counterparts were searched on the @xmath26mhz survey of williams et al .",
    "( 1966 ) by imposing the criterium @xmath27 .",
    "twelve out of @xmath25 sources were found to be associated with abell clusters with median redshift @xmath28 .",
    "these low - frequency uss sources are almost exclusively found in rich clusters , and are often associated with extended radio haloes or relic structures .",
    "syncrotron losses of an ageing population of emitting electrons , confined by the dense intra - cluster medium , may explain the unusual steepeness of their spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , radio spectra of the high - z uss sources do steepen at high frequencies due to a combination of syncrotron / inverse compton losses and the redshift . at low frequencies ,",
    "a flattening of their spectrum may result from syncrotron - self absorption occurring in the sources hot - spots .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     on the other hand , the angular - size bias seems to have little or no effect when an optical bias has been formerly introduced .",
    "let us consider the previously discussed case when the mrcc objects fainter than @xmath29 were selected .",
    "again , if the above angular - size bias is applied , the efficiency of the optical and uss searches remains almost unchanged , being respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this is somewhat expected since an optical bias like @xmath32 already selects those objects wich are , in principle , more distant and thus smaller .    to conclude , the introduction of a strong angular size bias such as @xmath12 , increases the efficiency in selecting hzrgs by a factor of two , independently on what searching technique is adopted ( optical or radio ) .",
    "note that the same increase of efficiency is obtained by selecting only those objects with @xmath33 , irrespectively of their angular size .",
    "the relative efficiencies of the optical and radio searching techniques as a function of different cuts in the magnitude and angular size distribution are summarized in table 4 .",
    "in this paper the real efficiency of the ultra steep spectrum tecnique in finding hzrgs is quantitatively demonstrated for the first time since this radio tecnique was introduced .",
    "moreover , an updated view is given of the radio / optical properties of the most representative uss sources samples and the role of the spectral index and angular - size biases is discussed .",
    "a new sample of uss sources was selected from the mrc/1jy sample ( mccarthy et al .",
    "1996 ; kapahi et al . 1998 ) .",
    "since the available radio dataset is not homogeneous , the radio flux densities from the nvss were used to re - calculate the spectral indices as @xmath34 and a conservative radio - spectrum bias @xmath35 was adopted to select the uss sources .",
    "our uss sample thus consists of @xmath36 mrc radiogalaxies with complete optical and radio data and it was used as a benchmark to study how different radio and optical biases do affect a homogeneous population of radio galaxies .",
    "it was found that the uss searching technique is much more efficient in finding hzrgs than a conventional search based on the optical magnitudes of the rgs .",
    "if no restrictions are applied to the optical magnitudes distribution , the uss technique may be up to @xmath4 times more efficient than the optical one .",
    "the obvious drawback is that a substantial fraction of the hzrgs population may be lost because of the introduced radio spectrum bias .",
    "when considering galaxies fainter than magnitude @xmath37 , the radio - steepness criterium guarantees that @xmath38 of the candidates are indeed hzrgs ; this has to be compared with a mere @xmath39 of the optical search .",
    "going to fainter magnitudes leads to a progressive increase of the efficiency of the optical search , that reaches its peak at @xmath40 with a notable efficiency @xmath41 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "note , however , that half of the hzrgs of the sample are lost when applying such a strong optical bias .",
    "interestingly , the efficiency of the uss tecnique @xmath42 remains stable around @xmath43 irrespectively of the applied optical magnitude bias ; going to fainter magnitudes only increases the fraction of genuine hzrgs that are lost ( up to @xmath44 at @xmath40 ) . to conclude , even at the faintest optical magnitudes here studied , the uss tecnique is @xmath45 more efficient of an optical search in selecting hzrgs , with the remarkable difference that the radio tecnique already reaches a @xmath10 efficiency at the @xmath46 magnitude limit .",
    "the advantage of the optical search is that , at least up to @xmath29 , a much smaller fraction of hzrgs is lost with respect to the radio tecnique ( @xmath39 instead of @xmath47 ) .",
    "the introduction of an angular - size bias to the mrcc sample , such as @xmath48 , increases the searching efficiency by a factor of two , irrespectively of the searching tecnique adopted .",
    "however this additional bias has little or no effect when a magnitude bias such as @xmath49 is applied first to the sample , as it is the case when the first step of the optical identification program is done on the digitized poss - i or poss - ii plates .",
    "this evidence suggests that the angular - size bias , sometimes used as an additional criterium , plays a secondary role with respect to the spectral index bias .",
    "this is also suggested by the finding that the uss samples actually adopting the steepest spectral index criterium and no angular - size bias ( tn and wn samples ; @xmath22 ) are those with the highest efficiencies in finding hzrgs .",
