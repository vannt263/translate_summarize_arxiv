    "in recent years , considerable effort has been invested in the study of the infrared ( ir ) behavior of green s functions in yang - mills theories .",
    "the results of these studies , using analytic methods as well as numerical lattice simulations , are usually compared to the predictions of various confinement scenarios .",
    "since green s functions are gauge - dependent quantities , one can expect to find different confinement pictures when considering different choices of the gauge .",
    "here we consider the landau gauge and test the predictions of the gribov - zwanziger and kugo - ojima confinement scenarios at lattice parameter @xmath0 , i.e.  in the limit of infinite lattice coupling .",
    "this study is very similar to that presented in refs .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not intended to be a simple duplication of that work since , in particular , the analysis we present here is not done exactly in the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite . also , even though there is probably no real difference at the level of the lattice data , as we show in section [ sec : plots ] and explain in sections [ sec : recent0 ] and [ sec : conclusions ] , we mostly do not agree with the data analysis and the interpretation of the results presented in ref .",
    "the interested reader is of course invited to read both papers and form her / his own opinion on this subject .      in landau gauge",
    ", the gribov - zwanziger scenario @xcite relates confinement of quarks to a ghost propagator @xmath1 enhanced in the ir limit when compared to the tree - level behavior @xmath2 as a function of the momentum @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , in this scenario , the enhancement of @xmath1 should account for the long - range mechanism responsible for confinement .",
    "an enhanced ghost propagator is also obtained by the kugo - ojima color - confinement criterion @xcite .",
    "consequently , in both cases one expects to find @xmath4 , which is referred to as _ ghost dominance _",
    "@xcite .    at the same time",
    ", the gluons should be confined due to the violation of reflection positivity @xcite .",
    "this implies that the gluon propagator in position space @xmath5 should be negative for a range of values of the space - time separation @xmath6 .",
    "since the gluon propagator at zero momentum @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath8 , it is clear that negative values for @xmath5 will tend to reduce the value of @xmath7 , leading to a suppression of @xmath9 at small momenta @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the kugo - ojima scenario one can show that the perturbative massless pole of the gluon propagator probably disappears as a consequence of the confining criterion @xcite .",
    "thus , an ir - suppressed gluon propagator can also be accommodated in the kugo - ojima confinement scenario @xcite . clearly , maximal violation of reflection positivity is obtained if @xmath10 .    even though these two scenarios predict similar behaviors for the gluon and ghost propagators in landau gauge",
    ", one should recall that the line of thinking in the two cases is quite different .",
    "indeed , in the gribov - zwanziger scenario confinement is due to the properties of the configurations belonging to the boundary of the so - called first gribov region @xcite , which should be the relevant configurations in landau gauge .",
    "on the contrary , in the kugo - ojima scenario @xcite , confinement is obtained if one can define unbroken global color charges . moreover , in the latter case , gribov copies do not seem to play any role in the confining mechanism . nevertheless , if one uses the kugo - ojima confinement criterion as a boundary condition @xcite then the partition function is equivalent to the one obtained using the gribov - zwanziger approach , i.e.  by restricting the functional integration to the first gribov region .",
    "yang - mills theories can be studied non - perturbatively using the field equations of motion of the theory , i.e. the sets of coupled dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) @xcite .",
    "usually , the solution of these equations depends on the considered truncation scheme and on the approximations employed .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that there exist two possible consistent solutions of the dse in 4d landau gauge .",
    "one solution , usually called _",
    "conformal scaling _ , gives an ir - enhanced ghost propagator @xmath11 and an ir - finite gluon propagator @xmath12 with infrared exponents @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the second solution , called _ massive _ or _ decoupling _ solution , is characterized by a tree - level - like ghost propagator at small momenta @xmath16 and by a finite nonzero gluon propagator @xmath17 at zero momentum ( i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "these two solutions have indeed been obtained by several groups @xcite , using different truncation schemes .",
    "let us recall that the conformal solution has also been obtained ( in landau gauge ) in 2d and 3d yang - mills theories @xcite with the exponent @xmath20 approximately given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the space - time dimension .",
    "possible explanations of the origin of these two solutions have been discussed in @xcite . for a description of confinement based on the conformal solution see @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "in @xcite the authors relate massive ( respectively massless ) gluons to color confinement ( respectively deconfinement ) .",
    "color confinement in the presence of massive gluons has also been related to the condensation of vortices @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that a criterion for quark confinement obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is satisfied both by the scaling and by the massive solution .",
    "the massive solution can also be obtained in 3d and 4d @xcite by using the gribov - zwanziger approach . in this case",
    "this solution appears when a suitable mass term is added to the action ( while preserving its renormalizability ) . in particular , the massive behavior is related to the condensation of a mass - dimension @xmath24 operator . by setting to zero the value of this condensate",
    ", one gets back the conformal solution .",
    "it is interesting that the same approach can not be extended to the 2d case @xcite .",
    "finally , the massive solution is also found by considering a mapping ( in the ir limit ) of the yang - mills action onto the @xmath25 theory @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations allow a true first - principles study of the ir sector of qcd , with no uncontrolled approximations .",
    "however , when studying the ir behavior of green s functions in a given gauge , care is needed in order to control possible finite - size , gribov - copy and discretization effects .",
    "recent numerical results for landau gauge at very large lattice volumes @xcite indicate a finite gluon propagator @xmath9 at zero momentum and a tree - level - like ir ghost propagator @xmath1 in 3d and in 4d .",
    "in particular , a flat ghost dressing function  or , equivalently , a null exponent @xmath26  has been seen first in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "a gluon propagator with an ir exponent @xmath27 has also been obtained using a tadpole - improved anisotropic lattice action @xcite . on the contrary , in the 2d case",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath28 and @xmath11 with @xmath29 between 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "note that this implies an ir exponent @xmath20 in relatively good agreement with the prediction of the conformal solution @xcite , i.e.  @xmath30 .",
    "thus , lattice simulations suggest a massive solution in 3d and in 4d , while the 2d case seems consistent with the conformal solution . it is important to note , however , that in the three cases one finds a clear violation of reflection positivity @xcite for @xmath5 at @xmath31 .",
    "also , lattice data confirm that , in the limit of large lattice volumes @xmath32 , the measure of the functional integration gets concentrated on the boundary of the first gribov region , in agreement with the gribov - zwanziger confinement scenario @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this limit the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the faddeev - popov operator goes to zero @xcite in 2d , 3d and 4d landau gauge .",
    "the extrapolation of the gluon- and ghost - propagator data to the infinite - volume limit has been recently improved by considering rigorous upper and lower bounds @xcite for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the smallest nonzero momentum on the lattice .",
    "these bounds are valid at each lattice volume @xmath32 and must be extrapolated to infinite volume , just as for the propagators . however , the bounds are written in terms of quantities that are easier to compute , better behaved or more intuitive than the propagators themselves .",
    "this allows a more precise extrapolation and may provide a clearer interpretation of the behavior of the propagators in terms of statistical averages .",
    "we note that similar bounds can also be written for @xmath9 and @xmath1 at general lattice momentum @xmath3 , and for various gauge - fixing conditions .",
    "thus , the bounds can be used to check the necessary conditions for the ir - enhancement of @xmath1 and for the ir - suppression of @xmath33 , clarifying when a gribov - zwanziger - like confinement scenario can be considered for a given gauge @xcite .",
    "gribov - copy effects on gluon and ghost propagators have been extensively studied on the lattice @xcite .",
    "recent results @xcite , using an extended gauge - fixing procedure , suggest that the restriction of the configuration space to the so - called fundamental modular region @xmath36 @xcite produces a slightly more ir - suppressed gluon propagator . at the same time , all studies agree that this restriction makes the ghost propagator less singular .",
    "this result has a very simple explanation @xcite if one recalls that the fundamental modular region @xmath36 is a subset of the first gribov region @xmath37 and that the smallest nonzero eigenvalue @xmath38 of the faddeev - popov matrix @xmath39 is larger for configurations belonging to @xmath36 than for configurations in @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "then , since @xmath40 and @xmath38 goes to zero in the infinite - volume limit , it is natural that @xmath1 should be smaller when a restriction to the fundamental modular region is implemented , i.e.  for any finite lattice volume we must have @xmath41 , where the subscripts indicate the region considered for the functional integration . of course ,",
    "after taking the infinite - volume limit one would still find @xmath42 .    finally , discretization effects are important for the breaking of rotational symmetry as well as for the possible different discretizations of the gluon field and of the gauge - fixing condition . in order to reduce effects due to the breaking of rotational symmetry ,",
    "three different approaches have been considered : to cut out the momenta characterized by large effects @xcite ( the so - called cylindrical cut ) , to improve the lattice definition of the momenta @xcite or to include ( hypercubic ) corrections into the momentum - dependence of the green s functions @xcite . as for the discretization of the gluon field and of the lattice landau gauge condition",
    ", several different definitions can be considered @xcite .",
    "these studies have usually found that different discretization procedures lead to gluon propagators that differ only by a multiplicative constant @xcite .",
    "the situation may be different for the @xmath0 case , discussed below .",
    "the case @xmath0 corresponds to the ( unphysical ) strong - coupling limit of lattice gauge theory .",
    "however , when studying the ir behavior of green s functions in a given gauge , it has some interesting advantages compared to the usual simulations in the so - called scaling region .",
    "indeed , at @xmath0 the partition function determines that the gluon configuration should be completely random , just as a spin model at infinite temperature .",
    "thus , correlation functions are probing only the effects due to the gauge - fixing condition . moreover , since at @xmath43 the lattice spacing is infinite ( see section [ sec : beta0 ] below ) , any lattice volume considered is also infinite and we can hope for an easier study of the infinite - volume limit of the theory . finally , one should also recall that the inequalities obtained in @xcite for the landau - gauge gluon field and gluon propagator are valid for any value of @xmath44 , including @xmath0 .",
    "early numerical studies of the su(2 ) gluon propagator at small @xmath44 , including @xmath0 , were presented in @xcite , showing the first numerical evidence of a gluon propagator suppressed in the ir limit . in particular , it was seen that , for @xmath43 , the gluon propagator is decreasing ( roughly monotonically ) as the momentum @xmath3 decreases . at small positive @xmath44",
    ", the gluon propagator also decreases for @xmath3 below a certain turn - over value @xmath45 , with @xmath45 depending on the value of @xmath44 . for this study the largest lattice volume considered was @xmath46 .",
    "we note again that no such behavior is observed in the scaling region on symmetric 4d lattices .      a recent and extensive study at @xmath43 , for the su(2 ) case and considering lattice volumes up to @xmath47 , has been reported in @xcite . in this case , the authors justify the consideration of the case @xmath43 because it should correspond to the formal limit of @xmath48 .",
    "this , in turn , would allow a study of the behavior of green s functions for a range of momenta @xmath49 , which is a necessary condition for the observation of infrared behavior on the lattice .    quoting the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors find that :    * the propagator s dressing functions show conformal scaling behavior for large lattice momenta , @xmath50 ; * finite - size effects are small ; * the combined gluon and ghost data are consistent with an ir exponent @xmath51 ; * both propagators show massive behavior at small momenta , i.e.  @xmath52 ; * this massive behavior depends strongly on the lattice discretization used for the gluon field and for the gauge fixing ; * while it is possible that this ambiguity disappears in the continuum limit , it is definitely present at commonly used values of the lattice couplings in su(2 )",
    ".    we will comment on the analysis of the data in section [ sec : plots ] . here",
    "we would like to stress that we do not agree with the limit @xmath48 as a motivation for this type of study .",
    "first of all , the authors of @xcite do not quote a value for the lattice spacing at @xmath0 or for @xmath53 .",
    "thus , it is not clear how the comparison is really made . of course , fixing the lattice spacing in the strong - coupling regime is not a simple issue ( we will comment again on this issue in section [ sec : beta0 ] ) . indeed , since we are far away from the continuum limit , the use of an experimental input is not really justified . nevertheless , if for example we fix @xmath54 from the physical value of the string tension @xmath55 , then the strong - coupling expansion [ in the @xmath56 case ] gives @xcite @xmath57 and in the limit @xmath58 we find @xmath59 . in this case * all masses * , evaluated on the lattice at @xmath0 , will have a null physical value if expressed in physical units and a comparison to the continuum physical value of @xmath53 would be essentially meaningless , since even the mass of a very heavy hadron would be infinitely small compared to @xmath53 .",
    "one could also try to set a finite value for the lattice spacing , as done for example in ref .",
    "@xcite using the results presented in @xcite .",
    "then , depending on the mass used as a physical input , one finds a lattice spacing ranging from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to an inverse lattice spacing @xmath62 between 141 and @xmath63 .",
    "then , assuming for example a value for @xmath53 of about @xmath64  which corresponds to @xmath65  we find that @xmath53 would have a value between 0.62 and 1.92 in lattice units at @xmath43 .",
    "thus , in this case , the condition @xmath66 is not satisfied by almost all the momenta considered in this work and in refs .  @xcite",
    ". moreover , if one selects as significant for the ir limit only data verifying this inequality , then the data region with scaling behavior ( described in the first item above ) should be discarded .    as for the ambiguity in the results related to different discretizations",
    ", it seems to us that it is not really present if one considers all data already available .",
    "indeed , in fig .",
    "11 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the difference between the standard and the modified landau gauge for the running coupling constant when @xmath44 is 2.3 is about @xmath67 at the smallest momentum ( corresponding to @xmath68 ) , for which the effect seems to be larger .",
    "this is quite a large difference but , as we will see below , it is probably mostly due to the ghost sector .",
    "indeed , the ghost dressing function enters quadratically into the definition of the running coupling , i.e.  this effect is artificially enlarged by considering the running coupling instead of the propagators .",
    "this difference decreases at larger momenta , being about 12.5% at @xmath69 , 10% at @xmath70 and 4.5% at @xmath71 .",
    "( here we used @xmath72 in order to convert lattice momenta to physical units . ) now , if one looks at the data reported in figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the case @xmath73 , there are `` hardly any differences '' between the two different discretizations , as stressed by the authors themselves .",
    "to be more precise , the difference in the gluon field is clearly within error bars , while for the ghost dressing function the ratio between the two results seems close to @xmath74 , again considering the smallest nonzero momentum ( corresponding to @xmath75 ) .",
    "this implies a difference of about 5% for the running coupling ( to be compared to a 10% difference at a similar value of @xmath76 for @xmath77 ) . for the next point ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath78 , this difference is about 2.4% .",
    "thus , the discretization effects observed in ref.@xcite seem to disappear in the continuum limit , being already reduced by a factor 2 when going from @xmath77 to @xmath73 .",
    "of course , a volume @xmath79 at @xmath73 is rather small . on the other hand , data for the gluon and the ghost propagators at @xmath80 , usually do not suffer from large finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "one should also recall that large discretization effects in the ghost sector when using the so - called modified landau gauge can be easily explained : indeed , in this case the discretized faddeev - popov matrix has an extra term , which is quadratic in the gluon field @xcite .",
    "this term , of course , is not present in the continuum expression for the landau faddeev - popov term and is also not present in the standard lattice landau gauge .",
    "thus , it is very plausible that the large discretization effects observed in @xcite be due to this peculiar characteristic of the modified landau gauge .",
    "this could also explain why in this case discretization effects can not be accounted for by a global multiplicative factor as in @xcite . by considering all this , we do not find the discretization effects studied in @xcite to be of significant relevance in the analysis of the ir behavior of green s functions in landau gauge .",
    "in any case , we are now studying these discretization effects in more detail @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that while simulations at null @xmath44 may be interesting for a qualitative analysis @xcite , they should clearly not be taken too seriously at the quantitative level .",
    "thus , a value of @xmath20 close to the preferred value of the so - called scaling solution  see the third item above  should at most be considered as a peculiar coincidence , not as a physically relevant result .",
    "here we present data for the gluon and the ghost propagators in landau gauge at @xmath0 both in 3d and in 4d .",
    "the 3d data , with lattice volumes up to @xmath81 , have been presented in @xcite . the analysis presented here and the 4d data , at @xmath82 , are new .",
    "we consider the @xmath56 case .",
    "let us recall that recent numerical studies @xcite have verified that ir landau - gauge gluon and ghost propagators are rather similar for the su(2 ) and the su(3 ) gauge groups , as expected from dse studies .",
    "thus , the analysis presented here is likely valid for the su(3 ) case as well .    in the 3d case we considered seven lattice volumes , namely @xmath83 , with ( respectively ) 1000 , 900 , 773 , 700 , 1240 , 344 and 364 configurations . in the 4d case we produced data only for the lattice volume @xmath82 , with a total of 567 configurations .",
    "the gauge fixing has been done using the stochastic - overrelaxation method @xcite . for the ghost propagator , due to technical reasons related to the computers used for the simulations , we employ the point - source method described in @xcite .",
    "let us note that the use of the point - source method usually increases the statistical noise in the evaluation of the ghost propagator as compared to the plane - wave source @xcite .",
    "however , in the 4d case with more than 550 configurations we have that more than 70% of the data have a relative error smaller than 3% and 94.5% of the data have a relative error smaller than 5% .",
    "so , the introduced fluctuations are clearly compensated by our increased statistics .    for our study of the gluon propagator in the 3d case we considered data for three different types of momenta , i.e.  momenta with components @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , plus possible permutations of the lorentz index .",
    "this implies that data corresponding to the momenta @xmath84 and @xmath85 have a statistics three times as large as the data corresponding to the momenta @xmath86 . in the ghost case",
    "we evaluate the propagator only for the momenta @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( plus permutations of the lorentz index ) .",
    "similarly , in 4d we consider momenta with components @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "for the ghost ( respectively gluon ) propagator we fully ( respectively partially ) applied permutation of the lorentz index .",
    "as shown above , it is not simple to fix the lattice spacing in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "indeed , if one uses an experimental input the result varies from a finite large value to an infinite value .",
    "this uncertainty is of course a manifestation of the possible discretization effects encountered at @xmath43 .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that for the study of correlation functions in landau gauge at @xmath43 one should consider the lattice spacing as infinite .",
    "this result does not use an experimental input but it is based on the properties of the gauge - fixing algorithms used for fixing the random configurations to landau gauge .",
    "since all the `` dynamics '' in the present study is produced by the gauge - fixing procedure , it seems to us more reliable to use the gauge - fixing process as an input for fixing the lattice spacing . to this end",
    "we notice that if @xmath91 then all lattice volumes correspond to infinite lattice size ( in physical units ) and all ( non - zero ) correlation lengths are also infinite ( again in physical units ) .",
    "this means that at @xmath43 we can work at _ constant physics _",
    " i.e.fixed correlation length in physical units  by simply changing the lattice volume @xcite without tuning the value of @xmath44 , as one has to do when using finite nonzero values of @xmath44 .",
    "( the same is true at @xmath92 , where all lattice sides and correlation lengths are zero in physical units . ) indeed , the evaluation of critical slowing - down of standard landau gauge - fixing algorithms , which requires working at constant physics @xcite , can be done also at @xmath0 @xcite , yielding the expected critical exponents .    of course , since we assume @xmath91 , in this work all data will be presented in lattice units .",
    "the gluon dressing function @xmath93 as a function of the ( unimproved ) lattice momenta @xmath76 for the lattice volume @xmath94 .",
    "symbols @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 represent data corresponding ( respectively ) to momenta @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "recall that for these types of momenta the largest value of @xmath76 is respectively equal to 4 , 8 and 12 . ]      in the continuum , the gluon propagator @xmath9 and the ghost propagator @xmath1 are just functions of @xmath98 . on the lattice , the momentum components @xmath99 are usually given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is an integer in the interval @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( here supposed even ) represents the number of sites in the @xmath104 direction .",
    "however , as explained in the introduction , due to the breaking of rotational symmetry , one expects the gluon and ghost propagators on the lattice to depend also on hypercubic corrections @xcite , with the leading term proportional to @xmath105 } = \\sum_{\\mu } p_{\\mu}^4 $ ] . in this section",
    "we try to quantify these corrections and see if they can introduce systematic effects on the analysis of the data .",
    "note that , to this end , we do not need to consider the @xmath44-dependence of these corrections , as described in section [ sec : recent0 ] above for the discretization errors of the gluon field , but only estimate the corrections at the considered value of @xmath44 .",
    "in order to get rid of these corrections one should extrapolate the numerical data to the limit @xmath105 } \\to 0 $ ] .",
    "this can be done when data are available for momenta characterized by the same value of @xmath76 but with different values of @xmath105}$ ] , i.e.  they belong to the same @xmath106 orbit but to different @xmath107 orbits ( see @xcite for description and notation ) . with the choice of momenta considered in the 3d case here",
    "( see the third paragraph of section [ sec : num ] above ) the extrapolation @xmath105 } \\to 0 $ ] can not be easily done , since we essentially have only one @xmath107 orbit for each @xmath106 orbit .",
    "the situation does not improve if one uses a different discretization for the lattice momenta @xcite , e.g.  @xmath108 .",
    "as said in the introduction , rotational symmetry can also be ( partially ) restored by considering @xcite an improved lattice momentum with magnitude @xmath109 } / p^2 \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{eq : pimpr}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is a numerical coefficient .",
    "( when considering physical units , @xmath110 has mass dimension @xmath111 , i.e.  it is proportional to @xmath112 . )",
    "note that , with the momenta considered here in the 3d case and for a fixed momentum @xmath113 , the correction @xmath105 } / p^2 $ ] is maximal , and equal to @xmath76 , if the momentum @xmath3 has only one component different from zero . on the contrary , this correction is minimal , and equal to @xmath114 ( where @xmath115 is the space - time dimension ) , if all the components of @xmath3 are equal . also note that the cylindrical cut @xcite selects data for which this correction is relatively small , i.e.  data close to the diagonal direction @xmath86 .    in order to estimate the value of the coefficient @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pimpr ] ) , we consider 3d gluon data corresponding to a certain type of momenta , e.g.  @xmath85 .",
    "then , for a given value of @xmath110 , we find a spline describing these data as a function of the improved lattice momentum @xmath116 .",
    "finally , we use this spline as a fitting function for the data corresponding to the other two types of momenta  @xmath84 and @xmath86 in this example  again considered as a function of the improved lattice momentum @xmath116 , with the same value of @xmath110 .",
    "let us recall that a spline is usually quite unstable outside the set of data that it describes .",
    "thus , this fit has been done only for data corresponding to a value of @xmath116 that is inside the range of momenta used for the evaluation of the spline .",
    "also , the zero - momentum datum has not been used for this analysis .",
    "clearly , the chosen value of @xmath110 , for each lattice volume , is the one that minimizes the @xmath117 value for the fit .",
    "we find that the coefficient @xmath110 obtained in this way depends on the type of momenta used to evaluate the spline .",
    "this is mainly related to the fact that the ranges described by the three different types of momenta are quite different . however , in most cases we found a value for @xmath110 of the order of @xmath118 and in all cases we found values smaller than the perturbative value @xmath119 @xcite , which is usually a good guess for data in the scaling region ( see for example the ghost propagator in maximally abelian gauge @xcite ) . that the effects of breaking rotational invariance are small is also confirmed ( see fig.[fig : z-100 ] ) by the plot of the gluon dressing function .",
    "note that these effects are usually more visible when considering @xmath93 instead of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar for the ghost propagator in the 3d case and for the gluon and ghost propagators in the 4d case .",
    "one should note that having small rotational - symmetry - breaking effects at @xmath0 is perhaps a surprising result , since one might expect strong discretization errors given that @xmath54 is infinite .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that at @xmath0 all data are effectively in the deep ir region and in this limit violation of rotational symmetry is usually quite small .      in order to test for behavior",
    "according to the conformal or to the decoupling solutions  and in analogy with refs .",
    "@xcite  we tried a fit of the numerical data using for the gluon propagator the fitting function @xmath120 , where @xmath115 is the number of space - time dimensions , and using for the ghost propagator the fitting function @xmath121 . for the gluon propagator we considered the cases @xmath122 and @xmath123 , corresponding to eqs .",
    "( 18a ) and ( 18b ) of ref .",
    "the function used for the ghost corresponds to eq .",
    "( 19a ) of the same reference .",
    "however , note that we usually fit the ghost propagator and not the ghost dressing function as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( we will comment again on this point in section [ sec : massive ] below ) . also recall that the scaling solution @xcite gives @xmath124 and @xmath125 , with @xmath126 in 3d and @xmath127 in 4d .",

    ", we find that our data strongly support the massive solution , i.e.  a finite gluon propagator and an essentially free ghost propagator in the infrared limit @xmath185 .",
    "moreover , the gluon propagator @xmath5 as a function of the space - time separation @xmath6 violates reflection positivity and it is well - described by a sum of two stingl - like propagators .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with data obtained at finite @xmath44 in the scaling region .",
    "we should stress that , in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite , a scaling solution appears in the gluon sector if one neglects the data at small momenta .",
    "as explain in section [ sec : recent0 ] above , we do not see any reason for excluding those data from the analysis .",
    "in particular , discretization effects at small momenta are under control and the large effects observed in ref.@xcite are probably only due to the bad scaling properties of the modified landau gauge . moreover",
    ", the value of @xmath20 clearly depends on the way the fits are done .",
    "in particular , a value close to the preferred value of the scaling solution , i.e.  @xmath21 in @xmath115 dimensions , is obtained only with very specific and ad - hoc fits . in any case , we believe that the scaling solution is clearly excluded by the ghost sector and we definetively do not agree on this point with the analysis and the conclusions presented in @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this case , the ir exponent @xmath20 depends on the interval considered , increasing essentially monotonically as the momentum increases , i.e.  it is impossible to find a decent `` window '' giving a constant value for @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", we have shown that the data for the ghost propagator are very well described by a simple function , recently suggested by an analytic study presented in @xcite .",
    "this function clearly supports the so - called massive solution .    as for the ongoing discussion about massive solution versus conformal scaling , we remark that the lattice results may be summarized as follows .    * in 2d",
    "landau gauge one sees conformal scaling @xcite , * in 3d and 4d landau gauge one finds the massive solution @xcite , * in 4d coulomb gauge , the transverse gluon propagator is well described by a gribov formula , going to zero at zero momentum @xcite * in the so - called @xmath186 gauges , which interpolate between the landau gauge ( @xmath187 ) and the coulomb gauge ( @xmath188 ) , one clearly sees @xcite that the behavior of the transverse gluon propagator gets modified when @xmath186 goes from 1 to 0 , becoming closer and closer to the behavior obtained in coulomb gauge as @xmath186 becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "the simulations cited above are essentially all done in the same way , i.e.in most of the cases by ignoring effects due to gribov copies , by using a standard discretization for the lattice action , for the gluon field and for the gauge - fixing condition and by using one of the standard gauge - fixing algorithms .",
    "recently , to rescue the conformal solution in landau gauge , several authors have explained the lattice landau data by evoking supposedly ( very ) large effects due to gribov copies , discretization effects and bias related to the use of the usual gauge - fixing algorithms .",
    "of course , one has to verify that all possible sources of systematic effects are indeed under control in a numerical simulation . on the other hand",
    ", it seems unlikely to us that these effects would show up in some cases of the simulations described above and not in others .",
    "for example , why would the 2d landau - gauge case be conformal and not the 3d and 4d cases if the same code is used in these three cases ? why should gribov - copy effects be so important in 3d and 4d landau gauge and not in 2d landau gauge and , even more strikingly , in 4d coulomb gauge , where one would expect stronger effects since the transversality condition is imposed separately on each time slice ?",
    "in our view , present lattice data are simply telling us that the infrared behavior of gluon and ghost propagators in landau , coulomb and @xmath186 gauge depends on the gauge - fixing condition and on the dimensionality of the system ( as , for example , the critical behavior of statistical mechanical systems ) .",
    "we believe that the present challenge is to understand why this is the case and that the bounds introduced by us in ref .",
    "@xcite and their interpretation in terms of magnetization and susceptibility of the gluon field could be a key ingredient in a simple explanation of present lattice results in landau gauge .",
    "finally a remark about color confinement . as said in the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite , we point out that the behavior of gluon and ghost propagators at very small momenta is probably not so important for the explanation of confinement",
    ". indeed , why should the behavior of a green function at a few @xmath189 , i.e.  for a space separation of about @xmath190 , be relevant for hadron physics , since the typical hadronic scale is of order of @xmath191 ?",
    "let us recall that in a recent paper @xcite it has been shown that the appearance of a linearly - rising potential is related ( in landau and in coulomb gauge ) to the momentum - space gluon configuration @xmath192 for @xmath193 .",
    "in this region one can indeed observe strong non - perturbative effects in the gluon and in the ghost propagators in landau gauge : the gluon propagator violates reflection positivity and the ghost propagator is enhanced when compared to the tree - level behavior .",
    "thus , some important predictions of the gribov - zwanziger scenario are still verified and , at the same time , one can try to relate the massive solution to the requirement of color confinement as in refs .",
    "we thank the organizers of the workshop on non perturbative aspects of field theories ( morelia 09 ) , where this work was presented , for providing a very stimulating atmosphere for discussions , in such a beautiful setting .",
