    "bhabha scattering ( @xmath2 ) is the process employed as a luminosity candle at electron - positron colliders . in particular , at high - energy colliders such as lep , the luminosity was measured by considering bhabha scattering events at small scattering angles . at high - luminosity meson factories ( da@xmath3ne , cesr , etc . ) operating at center - of - mass energies of @xmath4 gev , instead , the luminosity is determined by analyzing large - angle bhabha scattering events . in both cases",
    "the bhabha scattering cross section is large and dominated by electromagnetic interactions .",
    "therefore it is possible to employ the techniques of perturbative qed and predict the cross section with high accuracy . the smaller theoretical uncertainty which affects the resulting cross - section prediction directly translates into a more accurate determination of the collider luminosity .    for phenomenological studies and luminosity determinations , fixed - order calculations of the bhabha scattering cross section",
    "need to be interfaced with sophisticated monte carlo ( mc ) generators , which take into account realistic experimental cuts and the geometry of the detectors .",
    "the current experimental analyses rely on programs such as babayaga@nlo  @xcite , mcgpj  @xcite and bhwide  @xcite , which include next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections and effects related to multiple photon emission .",
    "the three generators mentioned above agree within @xmath5 for integrated cross sections and within @xmath6 for distributions as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from a fixed - order - calculation perspective , nlo corrections to @xmath2 are well under control . in particular , one - loop corrections in the full standard model were calculated long ago  @xcite .",
    "nnlo qed corrections to the bhabha scattering cross section play a key role in establishing the accuracy of current mc generators and , eventually , in improving it below @xmath5 as it might be required by electron - positron colliders of the next generation , such as the planned international linear collider .",
    "it is possible to subdivide nnlo corrections into three different sets : _",
    "i _ ) two - loop corrections to the process @xmath2 ; _ ii _ ) one - loop corrections including a single hard photon in addition to the outgoing electron - positron pair ; _ iii _ ) tree - level corrections with two hard photons or a hard electron - positron pair in addition to the @xmath7 couple in the final state of bhabha scattering . obviously , some of the diagrams belonging to the sets _ i _ ) and _ ii _ ) are infrared divergent .",
    "however , it is possible in both cases to include a class of real soft - photon corrections which can be added to the corresponding loop corrections in order to get an infrared - finite result for each class .    the calculation of the two - loop corrections belonging to set _ i",
    "was completed only recently  @xcite .",
    "two - photon corrections of class _ iii _ ) can be computed with any of the existing publicly available tree - level event generators and are safely under control .",
    "radiative corrections of class _ ii _ ) involve pentagon diagrams with one additional hard photon in the final state and are not completely known .",
    "partial results are available for small - angle bhabha scattering  @xcite and @xmath8channel annihilation processes at large angles  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to present the calculation of the one - loop corrections belonging to set _ ii _ ) . specifically , we have realized a modular fortran 95 code which allows for a numerical evaluation at fixed phase - space points of the one - loop qed corrections to the process @xmath9 ( here @xmath10 denotes a photon with an energy larger than a given cut - off threshold ) retaining a finite electron mass .",
    "the calculation has been carried out by employing the ossola - papadopoulos - pittau ( opp ) method  @xcite , based on a reduction of the tensor integrals performed at the integrand level  @xcite .    as a by - product ,",
    "we have computed the one - loop qed corrections to the annihilation process @xmath11 .",
    "this reaction is an important background for the determination of the pion form factor and provides an independent calibration for a measurement of the hadronic production cross section .",
    "in addition , it represents an interesting application of the opp reduction method in presence of two mass scales inside loop diagrams .",
    "note that a partial implementation of nlo radiative corrections to @xmath12 is currently available in phokhara  @xcite and kk mc  @xcite ( see ref .",

    "[ fig:1loop ] , the calculation of the complete one - loop corrections requires the evaluation of pentagon diagrams of class 2 g , the most challenging and time consuming part of this calculation .",
    "it is well known that any one - loop amplitude can be written as the sum of a linear combination of scalar box , triangle , bubble and tadpole integrals , whose analytic expressions were obtained in the seminal paper by t hooft and veltman  @xcite , and a so - called rational part . the rational term and the coefficients multiplying the one - loop integrals are ratios of polynomials in the masses and the kinematical invariants .",
    "these coefficients have been traditionally determined by means of the passarino - veltman ( pv ) reduction method  @xcite . however , for processes with more than four external legs , a straightforward application of the pv reduction can generate very large expressions involving inverse gram determinants and lead to numerical instabilities .    in recent years , a significant amount of work has been devoted to the evaluation of one - loop amplitudes for processes with five or more external legs . besides improvements on standard techniques , where a tensor reduction is explicitly performed , new unitarity - based numerical and analytical developments have emerged ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite where an exhaustive list of references can be found ) .",
    "both directions have been successfully pursued and have led to impressive results . in particular , in the last few months , very challenging calculations involving four particles in the final state , relevant for lhc phenomenology , have been completed  @xcite .    in the present letter",
    "we describe the evaluation of the one - loop corrections to the processes @xmath35 and @xmath12 , performed by means of the opp reduction method  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop amplitudes , generated through qgraf , have been processed with form  @xcite routines in order to produce a fortran 95 output .",
    "the latter has then been used as an input for two computer implementations of the opp technique which numerically evaluate the coefficients of the basis integrals and the rational part for each phase - space point  @xcite .",
    "both codes have been interfaced with publicly available software which allows for the evaluation of the basis integrals  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the cross section can be written as @xmath36 where the interference of the one - loop amplitude @xmath37 with the complex - conjugate tree - level amplitude @xmath38 is evaluated in dimensional regularization and subdivided into four contributions , according to the opp - reduction algorithm , @xmath39 here @xmath40 denotes the cut - constructible four - dimensional part of the result , written as a linear combinations of scalar boxes , triangles , bubbles and tadpoles , @xmath41 stands for the so - called rational part and @xmath42 summarizes all contributions induced by the ultraviolet counterterms . as a technical remark , we stress that throughout our computation we have used strictly four - dimensional external momenta .    the rational part has been written through the sum of the components @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as explained in ref .",

    "we carried out the ultraviolet renormalization in the on - mass - shell scheme : the renormalized charge is chosen to be equal to the value of the electromagnetic coupling , as measured in thomson scattering , at all orders in perturbation theory ; the squared fermion masses are identified with the real parts of the poles of the dyson - resummed propagators ; field - renormalization constants cancel by definition external wave - function corrections .    throughout our computation",

    "although qed is not simultaneously free from ultraviolet and infrared divergencies for an arbitrary number of space - time dimensions , we have followed the common practice of using the same dimensional regulator for isolating both ultraviolet and infrared poles .",

    ", vacuum polarization insertions can be easily removed by switching off all terms proportional to the sum over the fermions .",
    "we observe that the common structure of those terms , even in the general kinematic case we worked out , suggests that the contributions to the rational term @xmath44 can be fully combined with ultraviolet counterterms , thus achieving a significant optimization in this part of the calculation .    the cut - constructible term and the @xmath43 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deco ] ) have been obtained by direct application of the opp method .",
    "here we describe the two implementations of this part of the calculation .",

    "the basis of loop integrals employed by cuttools involves also rank - one and rank - two two - point functions in order to improve the numerical stability respect to the case where the basis contains only scalar integrals , as described in section  3 of ref .",
    "the additional tensor integrals have been included coding the relations provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second version of the calculation is used for cross - checking our results and it makes use of an independent fortran 95 code  @xcite for the reduction of the tensor integrals , which includes an optional optimization of the opp technique based on the discrete fourier transform  @xcite .",
    "the basis integrals are evaluated using the code oneloop  @xcite , written by a.  van hameren .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the rational part @xmath43 is computed by using different strategies in the two versions of the calculation : cuttools employs the mass - shift procedure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the second approach uses the counterterm - based method described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results obtained with the two independent implementations for the cut - constructible term and the component @xmath43 are in very good agreement .    a final comment concerns the vacuum polarization insertions ( such as diagram 2a in fig .  [ fig:1loop ] ) .",
    "although these types of diagrams are implemented in both codes , they are naturally incorporated in any qed computation by simply running the fine - structure constant @xmath75 to the appropriate scale .",
    "furthermore , the introduction of a running fine - structure constant allows for a straightforward inclusion of hadronic contributions using dispersion relations and the optical theorem .",
    "since this class of corrections is well - known , it will be neglected in the rest of the paper .      in order to check our calculation , it is useful to control the agreement between the values of the coefficients of the residual infrared poles for the virtual one - loop corrections and those of the analytic expressions of the corresponding poles arising from real soft - photon emission diagrams . in fact , the sum of the one - loop corrections to @xmath76 ( @xmath11 ) and the real - emission diagrams for @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) is infrared finite after integrating over the soft - photon phase space up to a given upper cut - off on the energy of the undetected photon @xmath79 .",

    "a second test on the precision of our calculation concerns the cancellation of the poles .",
    "after renormalization , the residual pole for @xmath107 is of pure infrared origin and it matches the infrared pole in @xmath108 with an agreement of 9 digits .    finally , as stressed in section  [ virtual ] , we have performed the calculation of all contributions by means of two independent codes .    as a further test of the stability of our results , we study the process @xmath98 for configurations in which the muon , or the antimuon , is ( almost ) parallel to the emitted photon .",
