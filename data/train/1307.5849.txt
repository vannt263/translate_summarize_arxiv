    "over the past twenty years , numerous planets have been detected by several different techniques , permitting the first estimates of the occurrence rate of planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as successful as these detection methods have been , each is sensitive only to a relatively narrow range of parameter space .",
    "for example , radial velocity ( rv ) studies are most sensitive to massive planets with orbital periods shorter than the time baseline of observations .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath6 of m dwarfs have a saturn - mass or larger planet within 2.5 au .",
    "beyond a few au , rv searches are incomplete as the time required for a planet to complete one orbit is longer than the typical observing baseline .",
    "some studies have attempted to extrapolate beyond this boundary .",
    "for instance , @xcite fit the observed rv planet population to a power law in planet mass and period and find that @xmath7 of fgk stars host a saturn - mass or larger planet within 20 au .",
    "recently , targeted rv surveys of m - dwarfs have suggested the giant planet occurrence rate is significantly smaller for these diminutive stars .",
    "@xcite suggest fewer than @xmath8 of m - dwarfs host a saturn - mass or larger planet with an orbital period @xmath9 days , and @xmath10 host giant planets with orbital periods between 10 and 100 days .",
    "transit studies suffer from similar detection biases .",
    "since a planet transits only once each orbit , several orbits must be observed to definitively confirm a planet so characterization is limited to planets with periods shorter than a fraction of the observing baseline @xcite .",
    "additionally , the probability of a planet transiting its host star decreases with increasing orbital period @xcite , such that hundreds of thousands of stars must be monitored in order to study the planet population at @xmath11 au @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the success of the _ kepler _ mission @xcite has allowed for statistical analyses of transiting planets to be undertaken .",
    "for example , @xcite analyze m dwarfs included in the 2012 list of announced kepler objects of interest ( kois , * ? ? ? * ) . by correcting for false positives ( detections when no transiting planet exists ) , false negatives ( nondetections when a transiting planet is present ) and geometric effects ( nondetections of nontransiting planets )",
    ", they estimate an occurrence rate of @xmath12 planets with periods less than 90 days and radii larger than @xmath13 per m dwarf star . the occurrence rate found by these authors is slightly higher than previous analyses which measure rates of approximately one planet per star @xcite .",
    "neither rv nor transit searches are yet conducive to the discovery and characterization of planets well beyond the `` snow line , '' where water exists as ice . instead , high contrast direct imaging techniques can be a powerful tool for detecting young planetary companions in this domain .",
    "the first direct imaging planet discoveries are securely in hand , including four companions to hr8799 @xcite and one each around @xmath14 pictoris @xcite , and gl504 @xcite .",
    "recent studies using these techniques have calculated an occurrence rate around a stars of @xmath15 at @xmath16 confidence for planets larger than @xmath17 and separations between 5 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "imaging studies have been most effective around high mass stars .",
    "nondetections around lower - mass stars have been used to place upper limits on the frequency of giant planets .",
    "for example , @xcite rule out the presence of giant planets orbiting fgkm stars beyond 65 au with @xmath19 confidence .",
    "high contrast imaging , while powerful , only provides a measure of the relative brightness of a companion . to estimate the companion s mass , the age of the star must be known and planetary thermal evolution models must be applied to estimate the temperature ( and brightness ) of the companion @xcite . moreover ,",
    "direct imaging is currently only sensitive to massive planets ; the hr8799 planets and @xmath14 pic b are believed to have masses @xmath20 .",
    "rv and transit studies suggest such `` super - jupiters '' are rare compared to jovian - mass and smaller objects at smaller separations @xcite .",
    "the gravitational microlensing technique is also effective for finding giant planets in wide orbits and does not rely on planetary evolution models . using this technique , planets can be detected by observing perturbations to the photometric gravitational microlensing signal when a planet and its host pass in front of a more distant star .",
    "since @xmath21 of stars in the galaxy are m - dwarfs , most lenses have mass @xmath22 . microlensing searches thus provide a measure of planet occurrence around low mass stars . microlensing studies are sensitive to planets near the einstein ring , @xmath23 , a much wider separation than rv and transit searches @xcite .",
    "@xcite find microlensing searches are most sensitive to planets at a projected separation in the range @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the mass ratio between a companion and the host star .",
    "these authors find a planet occurrence rate that can be parameterized by a double power - law function , in mass ratio @xmath26 and separation @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 the normalization constant is equivilent to @xmath29 .",
    "these results are calculated under the assumption that planets are distributed uniformly in @xmath30 , as is the case for binary stars @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite find a power - law slope in mass such that @xmath31 for neptune - sized planets , but do not attempt to quantify a normalization factor .",
    "as microlensing studies focus on distant m - dwarfs ( @xmath32 kpc ) in the direction of the galactic bulge @xcite , these stars can be difficult to characterize accurately due to crowding .",
    "stellar masses and metallicities are often estimated without being measured spectroscopically .",
    "if these host stars have different masses than assumed , it would affect the results of planet occurrence rate studies by microlensing groups as microlensing results do not account for correlations between stellar and planet properties .",
    "additionally , as microlensing searches are most sensitive near @xmath33 , beyond approximately 10 au the lensing signal becomes very weak , and differentiating distant planets from unbound , `` free - floating '' planets becomes difficult @xcite .",
    "rv and microlensing studies probe different regions around a star , and extrapolations between the two domains suggest a possible discrepancy .",
    "@xcite estimate a total giant planet occurrence rate significantly lower than the @xcite rv result .",
    "derived power - law distributions in mass may also be different for planets found by each method : @xcite find a distribution such that @xmath34 from rv - detected planets , while @xcite find a distribution such that @xmath35 .",
    "since microlensing studies target m - dwarfs , which are confined to a narrow mass range , we can approximate @xmath36 as @xmath37 . in this case , the microlensing result and rv result differ by @xmath38 .",
    "since giant planet occurrence decreases with decreasing stellar mass and metallicity @xcite , the expected giant planet occurrence rate around m dwarfs would be smaller than that for fgk stars .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to compare the microlensing planet population not to a population of fgk stars , but instead to a study of rv detected planets around m - dwarfs .",
    "historically , rv observations have been used to detect and characterize planets once they complete a full orbit , limiting studies to planets with periods shorter than the observing time baseline . in this paradigm ,",
    "potentially useful information is overlooked .",
    "wide companions are not completely undetectable : instead they can be identified by the presence of long - term rv accelerations ( linear `` trends '' ) which can be used to infer the existence of a companion in a more distant orbit @xcite .",
    "however , a linear acceleration does not provide unique information about the mass and period of the companion : the same trend could be caused by a jupiter - mass planet at 5 au or a @xmath39 m - dwarf at 25 au .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken by adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging .",
    "low - mass binary companions to nearby m - dwarfs can be easily imaged by modern ao systems @xcite .",
    "such detections form the basis for the trends high - contrast imaging survey , which to date has detected four m - dwarfs and one white dwarf companion to higher mass stars@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we combine rv and ao observations of nearby cool stars to estimate the frequency of giant planets in wide orbits around m - dwarfs . from a sample of 111 m - dwarfs observed with a median doppler rv baseline of 11.8 years",
    ", we identify 4 systems with long - term rv accelerations but no known companions and target these stars with ao imaging in an attempt to detect stellar - mass companions .",
    "we discuss these observations and our methodology in [ so ] . given an observed rv trend or lack thereof , we determine with high statistical confidence if a giant planet exists around each star .",
    "we analyze the effects of false positive and false negative detections of rv accelerations in our sample in [ stats ] . in [ results ]",
    "we estimate the occurrence rate of giant planets around m - dwarfs and compare the measure to results from other techniques .",
    "we summarize and conclude in [ sc ] .",
    "this study represents the first measurement of the planet population in the range 020 au .",
    "while we rely on brown dwarf cooling models , our study does not make use of theoretical planetary evolution models , unlike other ao studies of planetary systems .",
    "since 1997 , the california planet search ( cps ) collaboration has undertaken a comprehensive doppler search for extrasolar planets at the keck observatory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this sample was later extended to @xmath41 and currently includes 131 m - dwarfs within 16 pc of the sun , where we define the m spectral class as targets with @xmath42 .    to develop the sample used here , we first remove from this set 16 stars with a known , nearby stellar binary companion .",
    "we define `` nearby '' as a separation small enough that a test particle orbit with semimajor axis @xmath43 au would be unstable , following the instability criterion of @xcite .",
    "this criterion depends on the unknown eccentricity of the binary pair , as perturbative effects are maximized at periapsis .",
    "we take @xmath44 as a typical value and find the onset of instability occurs for binary stars with @xmath45 au .",
    "planets can still form in these more compact binary systems ( e.g. gl667c ; * ? ? ? * ) but at such small separations protoplanetary disk formation and planet evolution would be affected significantly by the presence of stellar companions .",
    "this selection thus allows us to study a class of planets that likely followed similar evolutionary processes .",
    "moreover , the detection of an acceleration around these stars is ambiguous , as it could be caused by the binary star , a planetary - mass companion , or both together .    after making the above selection",
    "we are left with 111 rv targets , all of which have at least 8 radial velocity observations and a time baseline longer than 2.9 years .",

    "a giant planet could also be missed if it was in a system with multiple giant planets .",
    "we observe only the sum of all radial velocity signals from all planets orbiting a star .",
    "for example , if a star hosts two giant long - period planets with one on each side of the star , the two signals would destructively interfere .",

    "the doppler amplitude of the inner planet would be a factor of 3.3 larger than the doppler amplitude of the outer planet .",
    "similarly , an external observer of the solar system would observe an rv signal from jupiter 4.5 times larger than that of saturn .",

    "this acceleration is subtracted from the observed radial velocity automatically by the cps rv pipeline @xcite , so this potential source of error is automatically accounted for in our data . moreover ,",
    "none of our observed accelerations are consistent with what would be expected from secular acceleration alone .      magnetic activity on a star can cause a false positive : rotating active regions can affect the shape of the observed spectral lines and thus the apparent rv @xcite .",

    "this result is consistent with our expectation .",
    "we then determine the radial velocity each simulated binary star would induce on our host companion .",
