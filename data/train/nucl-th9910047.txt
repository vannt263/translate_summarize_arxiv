    "modifications of spectral functions will be discussed explicitly .",
    "here we only briefly describe the most important physical inputs of the buu model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the mechanism of pion production implemented in the buu model includes two steps ( besides a small contribution from direct @xmath8 processes ) : in the first step the @xmath0 and higher baryon resonances are excited in inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 stands for a nucleon and @xmath11 for a resonance . at a collision energy",
    "1@xmath122 agev dominantly the @xmath13 channel determines the inelastic part of the total nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "the masses of the produced resonances are chosen according to their vacuum spectral functions @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pole mass and @xmath16 is the total mass - dependent decay width . in the particular case of the @xmath2-resonance @xmath17 gev , while @xmath18 is the free space mass - dependent @xmath2-width with @xmath19 gev , @xmath20 gev ; @xmath21 is the pion momentum in the rest frame of the @xmath2 and @xmath22 is the value of @xmath21 at @xmath23 .    in the second step",
    "the resonance decays into a pion and a nucleon : @xmath24 .",
    "the resonance decay at a given time step is simulated by monte - carlo using the free space mass - dependent decay width @xmath16 .",
    "the pauli blocking for the outgoing nucleon is taken into account in our calculations ( c.f .",
    "the life time of the @xmath2-resonance at its pole mass with respect to the pion emission is , therefore , @xmath25 fm / c , where @xmath26 is the in - medium decay width of the @xmath2-resonance , which is less than @xmath16 due to pauli blocking @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the produced pion can be reabsorbed : @xmath27 . since the average life time of the @xmath2 is much less than the characteristic time ( @xmath28 fm / c ) of a central heavy - ion collision at 1@xmath122 agev and the pion mean - free - path is quite small ( @xmath29 fm ) , a chain of processes @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , ... develops .",
    "moreover , the pion and nucleon rescattering on nucleons strongly reduces the probability for the decayed @xmath2 to be `` visible '' .",
    "therefore , only a very small part of @xmath2-resonances excited in the nucleus - nucleus collision , which is not absorbed in the process @xmath33 , can be observed by looking at their decay products  i.e. correlated @xmath34 pairs .",
    "we define a proton - pion pair as being correlated , if this pair originates from the same resonance and both the proton and the neutron do nt rescatter anymore .",
    "in other words , we will always consider only _ observable _ correlated pairs .",
    "for the collisions under study we have obtained numerically on average 1@xmath124 @xmath35 and 2@xmath126 @xmath36 correlated pairs per event in a calculation without acceptance cut ( table 1 ) . after filtering through the central drift chamber ( cdc ) acceptance of the fopi collaboration ( for au+au and ni+ni reactions )",
    "the number of correlated pairs decreases by a factor of 3@xmath124 . the cdc acceptance ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) was simulated by selecting only particles in the interval @xmath37 and , for @xmath38 , additionally the cut @xmath39 gev / c was applied . in table 1 we present the numbers @xmath40 and @xmath41 of correlated @xmath35 and @xmath36 pairs and corresponding ratios @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the number of `` random '' pairs , i.e. those pairs which are composed of a proton and a pion from the same event , but _ not _ emitted from the same resonance : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the total numbers of emitted protons and pions , respectively .",
    "the ratios @xmath47 are quite small ( @xmath48 ) which makes the separation of the true signal from the background ( see sect .",
    "iii b ) difficult .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the time evolution of the nucleon density profile and of the radial distribution of the correlated @xmath1 pairs emitted during the time intervals from @xmath49 fm / c to @xmath50",
    "fm / c , where @xmath51=14 , 18 , 28 and 38 fm / c , for the au+au system at b=0 .",
    "most of the pairs are emitted from the periphery of the system , where the density is low ( cf .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "1 , that the intensity of the emission reaches a maximum at @xmath52 fm / c and then slowly decreases .",
    "this is consistent with the pion production rate , which reaches a maximum at t=20 fm / c ( cf .",
    "11 from ref .",
    "thus , pairs are emitted dominantly at @xmath53 fm / c .    in fig .",
    "2 the radial dependence of the temperature is presented for a central collision of au+au at various times accompanied by the radial distribution of the correlated @xmath1 pairs .",
    "the local temperature was determined on a cubic lattice of 1 fm grid size introduced in the center - of - mass system of the colliding nuclei .",
    "a finite temperature fermi distribution has been adjusted such as to obtain the correct baryon density and average baryon kinetic energy in the local rest frame of the matter element in the lattice cell . during the time period of intensive pair emission , @xmath54 fm / c , the temperature at the periphery of the system decreases from 70 mev to 30 mev .",
    "this implies , that the description of the freeze - out of correlated @xmath1 pairs by some universal value of the temperature is quite schematic .",
    "the same conclusion can be obtained with respect to the freeze - out density , which is varying strongly during the period of intensive pair emission ( fig .",
    "1 ) . nevertheless , one can estimate some average value of the freeze - out density and temperature for a comparison with macroscopic thermodynamic models ( cf .",

    "3 shows the distributions of the correlated @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) pairs in the freeze - out temperature - density plane for different reactions .",
    "it is interesting that these distributions are very similar for all colliding systems regardless of the system size and , moreover , the collision energy .",
    "we always see a doubly peaked structure : at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , that corresponds to the decay of @xmath2-resonances in vacuum , and at @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 @xmath62 is the equilibrium nuclear matter density . in table 2 the mean values and dispersions of the freeze - out parameters are given for all reactions .",
    "the distributions are quite broad pairs in the freeze - out temperature - density are available from the authors as data files . ] and the mean values of the freeze - out density and temperature are essentially higher than the maxima of the actual distributions in fig . 3 : @xmath63 and @xmath64 mev .",
    "the baryon chemical potential extracted within the thermal model ( see next section ) at @xmath65 and @xmath66 mev is @xmath67 mev .",
    "these freeze - out parameters are different from the thermal model analysis of cleymans et al . for au + au collisions at 1 agev ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) : i.e. @xmath68 mev , @xmath69 mev .",
    "first we discuss the results of the direct analysis of the correlated @xmath1 pairs which can be unambiguously identified in the buu calculation . in fig .",
    "4 the invariant mass spectrum of correlated @xmath1 pairs is shown ( solid line ) for au+au central collisions .",
    "this spectrum was extracted by stopping the time evolution at @xmath70 fm / c .",
    "all the correlated pairs present in the system at this time plus the pairs produced by the forced decay of resonances were counted .",
    "we have checked that stopping the time evolution at later times does not influence the extracted spectrum of the pairs within the accuracy of our statistics , since for au + au central collision at 1.06 agev only 2% of all baryon - baryon collisions happen after 40 fm / c . in order to understand ,",
    "how various time intervals are contributing to the total invariant mass spectrum , we show also in fig .",
    "4 the partial spectra given by the pairs emitted at @xmath71 fm / c and at @xmath72 fm / c .",
    "we see that , in agreement with the discussion in the previous section , the total spectrum is dominantly composed from pairs emitted in the interval @xmath73 fm / c and that the low - mass pairs come primarily from very late times .",
    "we have analysed the final spectra of correlated @xmath1 pairs using a simple thermodynamical model including nucleons , @xmath0 resonances and free pions .",
    "for a given temperature @xmath74 and baryon density @xmath75 the baryon chemical potential @xmath76 can be exctracted from the equation : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the densities of nucleons and deltas : @xmath80 with @xmath81 . in eq .",

    "( [ dndeldm ] ) at various temperatures for the baryon density @xmath85 . for comparison ,",
    "the spectral function @xmath82 ( [ fmsq ] ) is also shown ( dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "the high - mass tail of the spectral function ( @xmath86 gev ) is populated very weakly .",
    "furthermore , the resulting ( @xmath87 ) invariant mass spectra have a shape quite different from the function @xmath82 due to the presence of the integral over the fermi distribution in eq .",
    "( [ dndeldm ] ) .",
    "the peak of the distribution @xmath88 is slightly shifting to higher masses with increasing temperatures .",
    "we see that the buu invariant mass spectrum is close to the thermal one for @xmath89 mev .",
    "a better understanding of the buu results is achieved if we weight the thermal model calculation with the distribution function @xmath90 of the @xmath55 pairs ( fig .",
    "3 ) . then the invariant mass spectrum of the pairs reads as follows ( see appendix for a derivation ) : @xmath91 the distribution ( [ pairaver ] ) is shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "5 . in eq .",
    "( [ pairaver ] ) we calculated the integrals for limits @xmath92 mev , @xmath93 . in this way",
    "the pairs emitted early at nonequilibrium ( high density ) and late ( low density ) stages of the heavy - ion collision were removed from the analysis .",
    "the weighted distribution fits the buu spectrum better than a calculation with fixed temperature and density using eq .",
    "( [ dndeldm ] ) .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ pairaver ] ) has no free parameters : it only uses as an input the distribution of the emitted pairs at freeze - out temperature and density .",
    "therefore , the mass distribution of the emitted pairs from central collisions is consistently described with a local thermal equilibrium assumption in agreement with the analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the experimental extraction method of the correlated ( @xmath94 ) pairs is based on background subtraction from the event - by - event spectrum @xcite . a standard way of the background construction is the event mixing technique @xcite .",
    "we have , therefore , also prepared mixed buu events taking protons and pions from different events.in the case of au+au collisions all events were taken at b=0 fm . for the reaction ni+ni we have taken events for @xmath95,2 and 3 fm , and a mixed event can be composed of two events at different impact parameters .",
    "we have checked that an additional restriction of equal impact parameters in both events does not influence the result in this case , since the collision dynamics changes strongly only for b@xmath96 fm . for the reaction ni+cu a mixing of @xmath97  5 fm events",
    "was performed selecting event pairs with equal impact parameters only",
    ". then the difference spectrum agrees with the spectrum of real pairs .",
    "however , for the ni+cu reaction , the mixing of the events without imposing any condition on the impact parameters produces a difference spectrum peaked at about 1.15 gev , i.e. at much smaller invariant mass , since the background spectrum gets shifted to higher invariant masses .",
    "the conclusion is that the difference spectrum resembles the spectrum of real pairs only if both events selected for mixing have impact parameters within 3 fm . note , that in our buu study the reaction plane is fixed and , in distinction to the analysis of the experimental data in @xcite , we did not rotate our events around the beam axis .    in figs .",
    "6 - 8 the total event - by - event and background spectra ( a , c ) and their differences ( b , d ) are shown for the systems au+au , ni+ni and ni+cu . for the event mixing procedure",
    "we have prepared sets of 30000 , 66000 and 24000 buu - events for au+au , ni+ni and ni+cu reactions , respectively . in order to reduce the computational time ,",
    "these events were calculated with the coulomb interaction switched off ( for a discussion of the coulomb effects see the next section ) .",
    "the number of mixed events is 10 times more for each reaction .",
    "the real correlated pairs , selected event - by - event , were extracted in parallel from the buu - events .",
    "the difference spectra ( points with errorbars in figs .",
    "6 - 8 ( b , d ) ) reveal a clear correlation signal at the invariant mass @xmath98 gev , in agreement with the spectra of the correlated pairs ( solid lines ) .",
    "the general agreement between the spectra of real @xmath1 pairs and the difference spectra opens the possibility to identify the spectrum of real pairs given by buu with the experimental difference spectrum . in this way one can get rid of large statistical errors , which are mostly due to the background constructed from mixed buu events . at the same time , when doing such a comparison , we neglect some systematical deviations of the difference spectrum , which depends on the adopted background construction procedure , from the spectrum of real correlated pairs , which is unambiguous . for instance , we see from figs . 6 - 8",
    "that , in distinction to the real spectrum , the difference spectrum can show a negative correlation and an increased high invariant mass tail .",

    "these results are obtained taking into account the coulomb interactions between charged particles in the buu calculation .",
    "however , it was supposed in the standard calculation , that the momenta of all particles are frozen after 40 fm / c and , therefore , the residual coulomb energy was neglected .",
    "the effect of the residual coulomb energy was , furthermore , taken into account by rescaling the momenta of particles as : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the coulomb energy of a particle at @xmath70 fm / c .",
    "the residual coulomb energy shifts the spectra of @xmath35 and @xmath36 pairs to smaller and larger invariant masses , respectively , by about 5@xmath1210 mev ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the complete role of the coulomb interactions can be seen now , e.g. from a comparison of the solid line in fig . 6d with the dashed line in fig .",
    "we see that the coulomb effects are shifting the peak of the @xmath35 spectrum in the au+au central collisions by about mev .",
    "the corresponding shift of the @xmath36 spectrum is about + 20 mev for the same reaction . at higher beam energies of about 2 agev",
    "the role of the coulomb interactions becomes negligible for the ni+ni and ni+cu systems .",
