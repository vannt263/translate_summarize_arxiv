    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics provides an excellent description of almost all physical processes as measured in terrestrial experiments , and is rightly regarded as the crowning achievement of many decades of experimental and theoretical work in elementary particle physics@xcite .    as exciting as this is , it is also apparent that the sm can not account for a wide assortment of astrophysical data , including neutrino oscillations , the matter - anti - matter content of the universe , the presence of dark energy and the presence of dark matter in the universe , and it does nt include gravitation . even before these astrophysical anomalies became evident , it was apparent on theoretical grounds , mainly associated with quadratic divergences in the scalar ( higgs ) sector , that the sm was to be regarded as an effective theory valid only at the energy scale of @xmath0 gev and below . at higher energies",
    ", it seemed likely that some new physics must arise , which would be associated with the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking    while a vast array of physics theories beyond the sm have been proposed , the general class of theories including _ weak scale supersymmetry _ seem to most naturally solve the theoretical ills of the sm , while at the same time they receive support from a variety of precision experimental measurements@xcite .",
    "most impressive is the measured values of three sm gauge couplings at the weak scale : when extrapolated to high energies using the renormalization group group equations , the gauge couplings very nearly meet at a point under supersymmetric standard model evolution , while they miss badly under sm evolution@xcite .",
    "gauge coupling unification suggests that physics at scales @xmath1 gev is described by a supersymmetric grand unified theory , and that below @xmath2 , the correct effective field theory is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , or the mssm plus gauge singlets ( since gauge singlets do nt affect the running of gauge couplings at one loop ) .",
    "supersymmetric models predict the existence of a whole new class of matter states at or around the weak scale : the so - called super - partners .",
    "gluinos , charginos , neutralinos , squarks , sleptons plus additional higgs scalars ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) should all be present in addition to the usual states of matter present in the sm . in order to fully test the hypothesis of weak scale supersymmetry",
    ", it seems necessary to actually produce at least some of the superpartners at high energy collider experiments , and to measure many of their properties ( mass , spin , coupling strengths and mixing ) , in order to verify that any new physics signal indeed comes from superpartner production .",
    "in addition , the properties of the superpartners will be key to understanding the next level of understanding in the laws of physics , perhaps opening windows to the physics of grand unification and even string theory .",
    "the key link between theoretical musings about various theories of susy or other new physics , and the experimental observation of particle tracks and calorimeter depositions in collider detectors is the _ event generator program_. given some theory of new physics , which usually predicts the existence of new matter states or new interactions , the event generator program allows us to compute how such a theory would manifest itself at high energy colliding beam experiments .",
    "thus , event generator programs function as a sort of beacon , showing the way to finding new physics in a vast assortment of collider data .",
    "searches for new matter states at the cern lep2 collider have found no firm new physics signals .",
    "we thus conclude that the sm higgs boson must have mass @xmath6 gev , while the charginos of supersymmetry must have mass @xmath7 gev .",
    "the fermilab tevatron is probing sparticle masses such as the gluino up to the 300 gev level .",
    "the cern lhc is a @xmath8 collider which is just now beginning to explore the energy regime where the sm breaks down , and where new physics ought to lie .",
    "lhc is expected to operate at energy scales @xmath9 tev ; this ought to be sufficient to either produce some superpartners , or rule out most particle physics models which include weak scale supersymmetry .    as we enter the lhc era , it is important to review the available calculational tools which are available , that aid in connecting theory to experiment . in this chapter ,",
    "i present a brief overview of some of the publicly available tools . in section [ sec :",
    "spec ] , i examine the various            more specialized matrix element generators , which tend to focus on specific reactions .",
    "les houche event files _ allow parton level collider events to be easily passed into general purpose event generators so that showering , hadronization and underlying events can be included . sec .",
    "[ sec : dm ] lists      codes designed to extract fundamental theory parameters from sets of experimental measurements",
    ". the supersymmetry parameter analysis ( spa ) project seeks to develop a uniform set of conventions which would allow unambiguous extraction of high energy model parameters from various collider measurements of supersymmetric production and decay reactions .",
    "i note here that this chapter is an updated version of the 1997 version by h. baer and s. mrenna which appeared in the volume _",
    "perspectives on supersymmetry _ , edited by g. kane ( world scientific)@xcite .      the first step in connecting supersymmetric theory to experiment is to begin with a supersymmetric model , and calculate the expected spectrum of superpartner and higgs boson masses and couplings . the models we will be focusing on are 4-d supersymmetric quantum field theories with softly broken supersymmetry at the tev scale",
    ". these models might be the low energy effective theory resulting from some even more encompassing theory , such as superstring theory , or a particular susy gut model , or which may invoke some specific mechanism for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the effective field theory is specified@xcite by adopting 1 . the gauge symmetry , 2 .",
    "the ( super- ) field content and 3 . the lagrangian . in the case of supersymmetric theories ,",
    "the lagrangian is derived from the more fundamental superpotential and khler potential , and for non - renormalizable models , the gauge kinetic function .",
    "the effects of susy breaking are encoded in the lagrangian soft susy breaking ( ssb ) terms .",
    "one must also specify the energy scale at which the effective theory and lagrangian parameters are valid .",
    "since collider experiments will be testing physics at the weak scale @xmath10 tev , while the lagrangian parameters are frequently specified at much higher scales ( _ e.g. _ @xmath2 or @xmath11 ) , the _ renormalization group equations _ ( rges ) must be used to connect the disparate scales in the model .",
    "once the lagrangian parameters are known at the weak scale , then the physical ( s)particle masses must be identified , often by diagonalizing the relevant _ mass matrices_. higher order perturbative corrections to the mass eigenstates at least at 1-loop are nowadays necessary to gain sufficient accuracy in the predictions@xcite .",
    "numerous researchers have developed private codes to calculate sparticle masses given high scale model inputs . here , we will focus only on _ publicly available codes _",
    ", since these are available to the general user , and are frequently kept up - to - date and user friendly .",
    "the first of the publicly available spectrum calculator codes to appear was the @xcite subprogram of the event generator @xcite , in 1994 .",
    "this was followed by @xcite ( 1997 ) , @xcite ( 2002 ) and @xcite ( 2003 ) .",
    "is a subprogram of the  event generator which calculates sparticle mass spectra given a set of 24 ssb input parameters at the weak scale .",
    "the program includes full 1-loop corrections to all sparticle masses .",
    "for higgs masses and couplings , the full 1-loop effective potential is minimized at an optimized scale choice which accounts for leading 2-loop effects@xcite .",
    "yukawa couplings which are necessary for the loop calculations are evaluated using simple sm running mass expressions .",
    "the @xcite program starts with models defined at a much higher mass scale ( _ e.g. _ @xmath12 ) , and calculates the weak scale susy parameters via the full set of 2-loop rges@xcite .",
    "an iterative approach to solving the rges is employed , since weak scale threshold corrections which depend on the entire susy mass spectrum are included .",
    "once convergence is achieved , then the complete set of 1-loop corrected sparticle and higgs masses are computed as in  . since  employs full 2-loop running of gauge and yukawa couplings including threshold corrections while  does not the sparticle masses will differ between  and  even for the same weak scale parameter inputs .",
    "the related program ` rgeflav ` computes the complete flavor matrix structure of the ssb terms and yukawa couplings , including @xmath20-violating effects@xcite .",

    "a standard input / output file under the name of les houches accord ( lha ) files has been created .",
    "all of the above codes can create lha output files .",
    "the advantage of lha output files is that various event generator and dark matter codes ( see below ) can use these as _ inputs _ for generating collider events or dark matter observables .",
    "the specific form of the lha files is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "several papers have been written comparing the susy spectra codes@xcite , although these tend to be all dated material , as the codes are continually being updated and debugged .",
    "while many features of these codes are similar , and so agreement between spectra tends to be good in generic parameter space regions , there are some differences as well . in particular , the codes  ,  and  all adopt a _ sharp cut - off scale _ between the mssm and sm effective theories . allowance for the sharp cut - off",
    "is compensated for by @xmath23 terms in the 1-loop sparticle and higgs boson mass corrections .",
    "the  code instead adopts a `` tower of effective theories '' approach , and incorporates threshold corrections in the 1-loop rges . here",
    ", the beta - functions changes each time a sparticle mass threshold is passed over .",
    "one loop corrections to non - mixing sparticle masses are implemented at each sparticle s mass scale , so all @xmath23s are minimized .",
    "sparticles that mix have all their susy parameters evaluated at the @xmath24 scale due to a need for consistency amongst the various soft terms that enter the mass matrices@xcite . in this way",
    ", better accuracy is expected in cases where the sparticle mass spectra is spread across a large energy range , as happens for instance in focus point or split susy , where scalars are at multi - tev values or beyond , whereas gauginos can be quite light .",
    "the multi - purpose event generators  ,  ,  ,   and  all have a complete set of tree - level susy particle production reactions encoded , and can be used to calculate tree - level sparticle production cross sections . in the case of  or  , the lha files from spectra generators can be used as input to calculate these , or general susy parameter inputs are allowed .",

    "the  code also calculates lowest order @xmath26 cross sections .",
    "the code @xcite has been created to calculate all @xmath27 supersymmetric production cross sections at hadron colliders at both leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd .",
    "the current version of  takes lha files as its input format .",
    "the programs  and  also calculate all sparticle and higgs boson @xmath28-body and @xmath29-body decay widths and branching fractions ( bfs ) .",
    "these widths and bfs are output in standard output files , and are used internally for event generation .",
    "the chargino and neutralino branching fractions are sensitive to the parameter @xmath30 in that at large @xmath30 , decays to third generation quarks and leptons are enhanced relative to decays to first / second generation fermions .",
    "the program @xcite is a relatively new release that combines  with the branching fraction codes  and  to also generate a table of sparticle and higgs boson decay widths and branching fractions .",
    "some of the decay modes in  are calculated at nlo in qcd .",
    "the branching fractions from  ,  and  all seem to enjoy excellent agreement with each other .",
    "the branching fractions of all these codes can be input to event generators via the lha input / output files .",
    "early versions of  took branching fraction inputs from the ` isawig ` output files .",
    "care must be taken in extracting branching fractions for neutralinos and charginos computed internally from  in that they may not be valid at large @xmath30 values @xmath31 , since yukawa couplings , mixing effects , and decays through intermediate higgs bosons are neglected .",
    "some specialized codes are available for calculating decays modes of the susy higgs bosons .",
    "these include @xcite , which calculates mssm higgs boson masses at two - loop level , along with branching fractions , @xcite which calculates higgs boson branching fractions including cp - violating parameters , and @xcite , which calculates higgs boson masses and branching fractions in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "supersymmetric models can be used to calculate sparticle masses and mixings , which in turn allow for a prediction of various sparticle production rates and decay widths into final states containing quarks , leptons , photons , gluons ( and lsps in @xmath22-parity conserving models ) .",
    "however , quarks and gluons are never directly measured in any collider detector .",
    "instead , detectors measure tracks of ( quasi-)stable charged particles and their momenta as they bend in a magnetic field .",
    "they also measure energy deposited in calorimeter cells by hadrons , charged leptons and photons .",
    "there is thus a gap between the predictions of supersymmetric models in terms of final states involving quarks , gluons , leptons and photons , with what is actually detected in the experimental apparatus .",
    "this gap is bridged by event generator computer programs .",
    "once a collider type and supersymmetric model is specified , the event generator program can produce a complete simulation of the sorts of scattering events that are to be expected .",
    "the final state of any simulated scattering event is composed of a listing of electrons , muons , photons and the long - lived hadrons ( pions , kaons , nucleons etc . ) and their associated 4-vectors that may be measured in a collider experiment .",
    "the underlying idea of susy event generator programs is that for a specified collider type ( @xmath25 , @xmath8 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and center of mass energy , the event generator will , for any set of model parameters , generate various sparticle pair production events in the ratio of their production cross sections , and with distributions as given by their differential cross sections .",
    "moreover , the produced sparticles will undergo a ( possibly multi - step cascade ) decay@xcite into a partonic final state , according to branching ratios as fixed by the model .",
    "finally , this partonic final state is converted to one that is comprised of particles that are detected in an experimental apparatus . by generating a large number of `` susy events '' using these computer codes",
    ", the user can statistically simulate the various final states that are expected to be produced within the framework of any particular model .",
    "several general purpose event generator programs that incorporate susy are currently available , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these include usually just the leading order @xmath27 susy production processes .",
    "in addition , specific @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) susy reactions may be generated by such programs as  ,  ,  ,  ,  and  .",
    "the output of these latter programs can be interfaced with the  or programs to yield complete scattering event simulations by generating output in the _ les houches event file _ ( lhe ) format .",
    "( isajet generates lhe output , but does not accept lhe files as input , since it includes its own mass and branching fraction generator ) .",
    "ideally , event generator programs should be flexible enough to enable simulation of susy events from a variety of models such as msugra , gmsb , amsb _",
    "etc._. this is usually accomplished nowadays by reading in the lha model files into the event generators  or  .",
    "since  does its own spectra calculation , it only outputs lha files , but does not accept them as input .",
    "* the perturbative calculation of the hard scattering subprocess in the parton model , and convolution with parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , * inclusion of sparticle cascade decays , * implementation of perturbative parton showers for initial and final state colored particles , and for other colored particles which may be produced as decay products of heavier objects , * implementation of a hadronization model which describes the formation of mesons and baryons from quarks and gluons .",
    "also , unstable particles must be decayed to the ( quasi-)stable daughters that are ultimately detected in the apparatus , with rates and distributions in accord with their measured or predicted values . *",
    "finally , the debris from the colored remnants of the initial beams must be modeled to obtain a valid description of physics in the forward regions of the collider detector .        the hard scattering and convolution with pdfs forms the central calculation of event generator programs .",
    "the calculations are usually performed at lowest order in perturbation theory , so that the hard scattering is either a @xmath27 or @xmath36 scattering process .",
    "matrix element generators are usually used for @xmath34 processes , with @xmath37 .    for supersymmetric particle production at a high energy hadron collider such as the lhc , a large number of hard scattering subprocesses are likely to be kinematically accessible .",
    "each subprocess reaction must be convoluted with pdfs so that a total hadronic cross section for each reaction may be determined .",
    "the @xmath38-dependent pdfs commonly used are constructed to be solutions of the dokshitzer , gribov , lipatov , altarelli , parisi ( dglap ) qcd evolution equations , which account for multiple _ collinear _ emissions of quarks and gluons from the initial state in the leading log approximation .",
    "as @xmath38 increases , more gluons are radiated , so that the distributions soften for large values of @xmath39 , and correspondingly increase at small @xmath39 values .",
    "use of a running qcd coupling constant makes the entire calculation valid at leading log level .",
    "once the total cross sections are evaluated for all the allowed subprocesses , then reactions may be selected probabilistically ( with an assigned weight ) using a random number generator .",
    "this will yield sparticle events in the ratio predicted by the particular model being simulated .    for sparticle production at @xmath25 colliders",
    ", it may also be necessary to convolute with _ electron and positron _ pdfs to incorporate bremsstrahlung and beamstrahlung effects .",
    "in addition , if beam polarization is used , then each subprocess cross section will depend on beam polarization parameters as well .      for reactions occurring at both hadron and lepton colliders , to obtain a realistic portrait of supersymmetric ( or standard model )",
    "events , it is necessary to account for multiple _ non - collinear _ qcd radiation effects .",
    "the evaluation of the cross section using matrix elements for multi - parton final states is prohibitively difficult . instead",
    ", these multiple emissions are approximately included in an event simulation via a parton shower ( ps ) algorithm .",
    "they give rise to effects such as jet broadening , radiation in the forward regions and energy flow into detector regions that are not described by calculations with only a limited number of final state partons .    in leading log approximation ( lla ) , the cross section for _ single _ gluon emission from a quark line is given by d=_0 p_qq(z)dz , [ eq : singleemm ] where @xmath40 is the overall hard scattering cross section , @xmath41 is the intermediate state virtual quark mass , and @xmath42 coincides with the altarelli - parisi splitting function for @xmath43 for the fractional momentum of the final quark @xmath44",
    ". interference between various _",
    "multiple _ gluon emission feynman graphs , where the gluons are ordered differently , is a subleading effect .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : singleemm ] ) can be applied successively , and gives a factorized probability for each gluon emission .",
    "the idea behind the ps algorithm is then to use these approximate emission probabilities ( which are exact in the collinear limit ) , along with exact ( non - collinear ) kinematics to construct a program which describes multiple non - collinear parton emissions .",
    "notice , however , that the cross section ( [ eq : singleemm ] ) is singular as @xmath45 and as @xmath46 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the regime of collinear and also soft gluon emission .",
    "these singularities can be regulated by introducing physically appropriate cut - offs .",
    "a cutoff on the value of @xmath47 of order @xmath48 gev corresponds to the scale below which qcd perturbation theory is no longer valid .",
    "a cutoff on @xmath49 is also necessary , and physically corresponds to the limit beyond which the gluon is too soft to be resolved .",
    "the ps algorithms available vary in their degree of sophistication .",
    "the simplest algorithm was created by fox and wolfram in 1979@xcite .",
    "their method was improved to account for interference effects in the angle - ordered algorithm of marchesini and webber@xcite .",
    "in addition , parton emission from heavy particles results in a dead - cone effect , where emissions in the direction of the heavy particle are suppressed .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to include spin correlations in the ps algorithm .",
    "ps algorithms are also applied to the initial state partons . in this case ,",
    "a backwards shower algorithm is most efficient , which develops the emissions from the hard scattering backwards in time towards the initial state .",
    "the backward shower algorithm developed by sjstrand@xcite makes use of the pdfs evaluated at different energy scales to calculate the initial state parton emission probabilities .",
    "not only are there many reactions available via which susy particles may be produced at colliders , but once produced , there exist many ways in which superparticles may decay . for the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) , there may be only one or at most a few ways to decay to the lsp .",
    "thus , for a collider such as lep or even the fermilab tevatron , where only the lightest sparticles will have significant production rates , we might expect that their associated decay patterns will be relatively simple .",
    "however , the number of possible final states increases rapidly if squarks and gluinos that can decay into the heavier charginos and neutralinos are accessible , and the book - keeping becomes correspondingly more complicated . indeed , at the cern lhc , where the massive strongly interacting sparticles such as gluinos and squarks are expected to be produced at large rates",
    ", sparticle cascade decay patterns can be very complex .",
    "as a rough estimate , of order @xmath50 subprocess cross sections may be active at lhc energies , with of order 10 decay modes for each sparticle .",
    "naively , this would give of order @xmath51 @xmath34-body subprocesses that would need to be calculated .",
    "monte carlo event generators immensely facilitate the analysis of signals from such complex cascade decays , especially in the case where no single decay chain dominates .",
    "an event generator can select different cascade decay branches by generating a random number which picks out a particular decay choice , with a weight proportional to the corresponding branching fraction , at each step of the cascade decay .",
    "quarks and gluons produced as the end products of cascade decays will shower off still more quarks and gluons , with probabilities determined by the ps algorithm .",
    "the procedure that we have just described is exact for cascade decays of spinless particles into two other spinless particles at each step in the cascade .",
    "this is because the squared matrix element is just a constant , and there are no spin correlations possible .",
    "this is not true in general and in many cases , it can be very important to include the decay matrix element and/or spin correlations in the calculation of cascade decays of sparticles .",
    "a general method for incorporating spin correlations based on density matrices has been put forth by richardson@xcite , and incorporated into  .",
    "spin correlation effects are especially important for precision measurements at @xmath25 linear colliders .",
    "while retaining spin correlations may be less crucial in many situations at a hadron collider , this is not always the case .",
    "for instance , relativistic @xmath52 leptons produced from @xmath53 decay are always left - handed , while those produced from a charged higgs decay are always right - handed .",
    "likewise , the polarization of the taus from @xmath54 decays depends on the stau mixing angle .",
    "since the undetectable energy carried off by @xmath55 from tau decay depends sensitively on the parent tau helicity , it is necessary to include effects of tau polarization in any consideration involving the energy of `` tau jets '' . by evaluating the mean polarization of taus in any particular process",
    ", these effects can be incorporated , at least on average , into event generator programs such as  .",
    "of course , such a procedure would not include correlations between decay products of two taus produced in the same reaction .",
    "another aspect is to include appropriately the complete 3-body decay matrix elements . while some programs merely use a flat phase space distribution ,  and  include pre - programmed exact decay matrix elements .",
    "once sparticles have been produced and have decayed through their cascades , and parton showers have been evolved up to the point where the partons have virtuality smaller than @xmath56  gev@xmath57 , the partons must be converted to hadrons .",
    "this is a non - perturbative process , and one must appeal to phenomenological models for its description .",
    "the independent hadronization ( ih ) model of field and feynman@xcite is the simplest such model to implement . in this picture ,",
    "a new quark anti - quark pair @xmath58 can be created in the color field of the parent quark @xmath59 .",
    "then the @xmath60 pair can turn into a meson with a longitudinal momentum fraction described by a phenomenological function , with the remainder of the longitudinal momentum carried by the quark @xmath61 .",
    "this process is repeated by the creation of a @xmath62 pair in the color field of @xmath61 , and so on down the line to @xmath63 .",
    "a host of mesons are thus produced , and decayed to the quasi - stable @xmath64 , @xmath65 mesons according to their experimental properties .",
    "the final residual quark @xmath66 will have very little energy , and can be discarded without significantly affecting jet physics .",
    "finally , a small transverse momentum can be added according to a pre - assigned gaussian probability distribution to obtain a better description of the data .",
    "quark fragmentation into baryons is also possible by creation of diquark pairs in its color field , and can be incorporated .",
    "the ih scheme , with many parameters tuned to fit the data , will thus describe the bulk features of hadronization needed for event simulation programs .",
    "the string model of hadronization developed at lund@xcite is a more sophisticated model than ih , which treats hadron production as a universal process independent of the environment of the fragmenting quark . in the string model , a produced quark - antiquark pair",
    "is assumed to be connected by a color flux tube or string .",
    "as the quark - antiquark pair moves apart , more and more energy is stored in the string until it is energetically favorable for the string to break , creating a new quark - antiquark pair .",
    "gluons are regarded as kinks in the string .",
    "the string model correctly accounts for color flow in the hadronization process , as opposed to the ih model . in @xmath67 ( 3-jet )",
    "events , the string model predicts fewer produced hadrons in the regions between jets than the ih model , in accord with observation .    a third scheme for hadronization is known as the cluster hadronization model@xcite . in this case ,",
    "color flow is still accounted for , but quarks and antiquarks that are nearby in phase space will form a cluster , and will hadronize according to preassigned probabilities .",
    "this model avoids non - locality problems associated with the string hadronization model , where quarks and antiquarks separated by spacelike distances can affect the hadronization process .",
    "finally , at a hadron collider the colored remnants of the nucleon that did not participate in the hard scattering must be accounted for .",
    "these beam remnant effects produce additional energy flow , especially in the far forward regions of the detector .",
    "a variety of approaches are available to describe these non - perturbative processes , including models involving pomeron exchange and multiple scatterings .",
    "in addition , the beam remnants must be hadronized as well , and appear to require a different parametrization from `` minimum bias '' events where there are only beam jets but no hard scattering .",

    "is part of the  package .",
    "it includes a subroutine @xcite to evaluate the neutralino relic density , the direct neutralino detection rates via spin - independent and spin - dependent scattering , the @xmath77 branching fraction , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and the thermally averaged neutralino annihilation cross section , which is key input to neutralino halo annihilation calculations .",
    "if supersymmetry is indeed discovered at the tevatron , lhc and/or a linear @xmath25 collider , then an exciting task will be to make precision measurements of all sparticle masses , spins , couplings and mixings .",
    "once these are known , then , if the mssm is indeed the correct effective theory all the way from @xmath81 to @xmath2 , it is possible to map out the gut scale values of the soft susy breaking parameters . once these are known , important information will be gained which will allow for the construction of susy models at or beyond the gut scale .",
    "two such codes are available which accomplish this task : @xcite and @xcite .      the supersymmetry parameter analysis ( spa ) project@xcite is an attempt to achieve co - ordination between the various sparticle mass generation codes , event generators , relic density codes , and parameter fitting codes , with a goal in mind to determine the fundamental susy lagrangian . in the spa convention , all programs should input / ouput susy parameters in the @xmath82 scheme at the @xmath83 tev scale .",
    "once this benchmark is set , then all remaining calculations may proceed from this common agreed upon point .      in the past decade",
    ", there has been an explosion of interest in supersymmetry phenomenology .",
    "this is exhibited in part by the corresponding development of numerous computational tools to aid in supersymmetry calculations for expected collider events and for dark matter observables .",
    "supersymmetry has certainly been an enduring theme in high energy physics .",
    "hopefully , at the dawn of the lhc era , we are on the verge of actual discovery of supersymmetry . in this case",
    ", many of these tools for susy will be put to good hard use , as the community analyzes the upcoming collider data .",
    "we expect that new tools for susy will emerge , which will be more focused on the new matter states that might appear . as an example , if susy is discovered , then the mssm ( or perhaps nmssm ) may become the new sm , and radiative corrections will have to be calculated for any remaining production and decay reactions , and in a form suitable for embedding in event generator programs .",
    "the clues we find pertaining to dark matter will impact on all astrophysical codes .",
    "in addition , new tools should also emerge that facilitate model building , as the clues we expect to emerge from the data point the way to a new paradigm in physics beyond the standard model .",
