    "compared to the number of phenomenological applications , where nnlo qcd corrections are indispensable , the effort put into the construction of general subtraction schemes for real radiation at this level of perturbation theory is astounding .",
    "the main problems encountered are either , that the method is not general and requires tedious adaptation to every specific problem , or that there are many highly non - trivial divergent dimensionally regulated integrals to evaluate .",
    "this state of affairs is to be contrasted with the comforting situation at the nlo level , where general solutions have been available for long .",
    "the approach of choice is that of catani and seymour @xcite , later extended to massive states @xcite and arbitrary polarizations in real radiation @xcite .",
    "in fact , we would encourage the non - expert reader to consult the original paper @xcite , since it gives a thorough discussion of all aspects of the problem .",
    "the present letter assumes such knowledge .",
    "the main features of the catani - seymour subtraction scheme are the smooth interpolation of the subtraction terms between soft and collinear limits and independence from the phase space parameterization achieved by a remapping of phase space points onto the reduced phase space with one parton less .",
    "there is another scheme at nlo derived by kunszt , frixione and signer ( fks ) @xcite , which is vastly different on the conceptual side . here",
    ", the phase space is first decomposed into sectors ( originally with the help of the jet function ; an independent decomposition has been proposed in @xcite ) , and then parameterized with energy and angle variables for easy extraction of the subtraction terms .",
    "precisely these ideas will turn out to be crucial for the scheme that we shall derive .",
    "many approaches have been proposed at nnlo .",
    "the most successful ones are sector decomposition @xcite and antenna subtraction @xcite .",
    "sector decomposition is conceptually entirely different from the nlo methods cited above .",
    "the idea is to derive a laurent expansion for the given amplitude , by first ingeniously parameterizing the complete phase space , mapping it onto the unit hypercube , and then dividing it into simplexes , in which singularities are factorized .",
    "the parameterization is adapted to different singularity structures for different diagram classes .",
    "a detailed description on the particular example of higgs boson production can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main drawback is that one has to repeat everything for a new problem , which is relatively easy , if it involves the same number of particles in the final state with the same mass distribution , but is expected to be a major effort otherwise .",
    "antenna subtraction , on the other hand , uses complete matrix elements of simpler processes as building blocks for the subtraction . in this way",
    ", the integration over the unresolved particle phase space can be made largely with multi - loop methods .",
    "it is this latter part that involves most work , but the result is general and can be applied to other processes without modification .",
    "the drawback of this approach is the efficiency loss due to the fact that azimuthal correlations characteristic of collinear limits are not taken into account , as the simplified matrix elements correspond to unpolarized scattering .",
    "there are also other methods , which are either specific to a class of problems , such as that of @xcite , which solves the problem for the production of colorless states , or still require the integration of the subtraction terms , as for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to present a new approach , which should provide a method both general and simple to derive . to this end , we need to specify , which problems are essentially difficult and which are not . unlike at nlo , there are in fact two different problems involving real radiation at nnlo .",
    "one involves the emission of one additional parton ( in comparison to leading order ) out of virtual diagrams .",
    "usually called single - real radiation , since only one parton can become unresolved , it can be treated by any of the nlo methods .",
    "of course , the subtraction terms require a slight modification .",
    "in fact , we believe that the fks approach will provide the result with the least effort . by this argument",
    ", we shall ignore single - real radiation and concentrate on double - real radiation .",
    "the latter problem involves two unresolved partons and only tree - level matrix elements .",
    "the method presented will not depend on the nature of the initial state .",
    "let us , however , consider the more difficult case of hadronic collisions .",
    "due to the factorization theorem , the result is a convolution of partonic cross sections with parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "as long as the partonic cross section is an ordinary function , this convolution can be considered independently ( see section  [ sec : phase ] ) .",
    "indeed , in actual monte carlo generators , one first generates the fractions of hadron momenta to be assigned to the partons and then works in the center - of - mass frame of the partons , multiplying every event by the pdf weight only at the end .",
    "this is the point of view that we shall adopt as well . to summarize",
    ": we will consider the derivation of the laurent expansion of the double - real radiation contributions for fixed initial parton energies .",
    "the main concept of our approach is to mix some ideas of the fks nlo subtraction scheme with those of sector decomposition .",
    "we will decompose the phase space in two stages . at the first stage",
    ", we will divide the problem into triple- and double - collinear sectors . then , using an energy - angle parameterization of the phase space , we will perform an ordinary sector decomposition mimicking the physical singular limits .",
    "the crucial novelty is that we will show how to obtain general subtraction terms from the last sector decomposition . here",
    ", we will use the knowledge of nnlo singular behavior of qcd amplitudes as studied in @xcite and summarized in @xcite .",
    "while we will not give explicit expressions for the subtraction terms , a task impossible in a letter due to the multitude of cases , it is easy to rederive them following the description .    in the next section",
    ", we will derive the scheme on the example of massive particle production .",
    "the reason for this restriction on the final state is that this letter will be followed by a companion publication with process specific information and numerical results for our first application : top quark pair production .",
    "a subsequent section will , however , present the generalization to arbitrary final states .",
    "let us assume that there are only two massless partons in the final state , the other final state particles being massive . in case there is only one massive final state , the presence of soft singularities leads to a cross section , which is a distribution in the partonic center - of - mass energy squared , @xmath0 .",
    "we will not take this possibility into account , since it has already been extensively studied for all processes of phenomenological interest and is a special case involving additional complications .",
    "the cross section will , therefore , be an ordinary function of @xmath0 .",
    "the considered process corresponds to the following kinematical configuration @xmath1 with @xmath2 where @xmath3 are @xmath4-dimensional momentum vectors .",
    "the @xmath4-dimensional phase space can be written as @xmath5 the above definition suggests a factorization of the phase space for this problem into the three - particle production phase space of the two massless partons together with an object with invariant mass @xmath6 , and a decay phase space of the composite with momentum @xmath7 into the massive particles .",
    "such a factorization is motivated by the fact that most divergences are due to the vanishing of invariants involving only massless states momenta .",
    "the divergences not belonging to this class are soft and involve the massive states momenta . in this case , the inverse propagators responsible for the singularities vanish proportionally to a linear combination of the energy components of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this will force us to use these energy components as part of the phase space parameterization . at this point",
    "the phase space can be written as @xmath10 the integrations over @xmath7 can be performed by exploiting the @xmath11-function , which leaves @xmath12 where @xmath13 the same result could have been obtained directly ( and trivially ) from the original expression given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ps1 ] ) , but we wish to keep the interpretation of the integral as described above .",
    "notice that the parameterization of @xmath14 will be of no further concern to us , apart from the fact that it is a continuous function of @xmath7 .",
    "let us mention , however , that a particularly suitable approach is to define @xmath14 in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath7 . in this case ,",
    "suitable integration parameters can be chosen to allow the integration over @xmath15 to be the first in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase0 ] ) .    at this point",
    ", we can already derive the boundaries of the three - particle phase space . from here on , we will work in the center - of - mass system of the colliding particles .",
    "momentum conservation from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mom ] ) implies @xmath16 which can be rewritten as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the angle between the directions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "this is due to the fact that @xmath29 , which implied @xmath30 $ ] ( otherwise @xmath31 ) .",
    "of course , the independence of the limits can be understood intuitively by noticing that they all remove one of the massless partons .",
    "only the removal of the two massless partons at the same time ( double - soft limit ) requires flexibility in the choice of @xmath6 , since then all of the initial state energy is transmitted to the @xmath7 system .    to obtain the upper bounds on the variables , we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond ] ) for one of the energies ( the expressions are symmetric ) @xmath32 independently of the other parton , the maximum is obtained when @xmath33 , _ i.e. _ the composite system @xmath7 is at threshold .",
    "furthermore , the absolute maximum of the energy occurs , when the other parton has vanishing energy @xmath34 this case does not lead to any divergences , since there is no phase space at threshold for the massive @xmath7 system . here ,",
    "the relative angle , @xmath28 , has no relevance . for a finite energy of the second parton ,",
    "the maximum is obtained at @xmath35 , which corresponds to the two partons being anti - parallel @xmath36 notice , however , that we will not use this bound explicitly , since our parameterizations will first specify the angles and only then the energies , and thus the upper bound will rather be given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : upp ] ) with @xmath33 .",

    "we will now decompose the phase space taking into account the collinear singularities only .",
    "the soft singularities will be treated in the next step .",
    "collinear singularities occur , when one or more of the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",

    "both functions are supposed to fulfill @xmath54 and vanish in the respective limits fast enough to regulate collinear divergences .",
    "the simplest construction satisfying these requirements is @xmath55 .",

    "( [ eq : part1 ] ) will allow for singularities , when @xmath8 and @xmath9 will be parallel to different momenta , which means that we can treat the problem as if it were an iterated next - to - leading order limit .",
    "we must , however , be careful with the situation , when neither of the momenta is close to its respective limit , but they both tend to each other . in order to separate further this singularity",

    "the parameterizations will be related by symmetry with respect to the exchange of @xmath66 .",
    "we now turn to the case , where the singularities are due to the three momenta @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath52 .",

    "the first two structures are already fully factorized .",
    "problems arise only in the third and fourth cases .",

    "in other words , @xmath89 is not substantial for our discussion .     and the second branch starting with the dashed line is symmetric to the first . ]    at this point , we are ready to introduce a further decomposition of the phase space that will factorize the invariants given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : invariants ] ) and the @xmath90 factor from the phase space measure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase2 ] ) into a product of the integration variables and a function , which does not vanish in any of the singular limits .",
    "the decomposition is presented in form of a tree in fig .",

    "collinear singularities require two levels of decompositions , since besides defining which of the two partons is allowed to become parallel to @xmath52 first , we need to single out the possibility that the partons become collinear to each other first and only then to @xmath52 .",

    "it is general , just as much as the nlo subtraction schemes , in the sense that the relevant construction is independent of the process .",
    "notice that we did not consider it important to show that with this construction observables would be finite after combination with the remaining contributions ( double - virtual and real - virtual ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the correctness of the laurent expansion obtained with the present method is proven by the correctness of the intermediate steps .",
    "the cancellation of the divergences is then guaranteed by the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg and by the factorization theorem . on the other hand ,",
    "aiming at a proof of cancellation leads to a substantial complication of the scheme . for us ,",
    "the simplicity of the numerical implementation was of paramount importance .",
    "a similar philosophy was already present in the sector decomposition method for phase spaces as devised in @xcite .",
    "as far as the cancellation of the divergences in dimensional regularization is concerned , a comment is , however , in order . in principle",
    ", consistency is guaranteed by the use of the conventional dimensional regularization scheme .",
    "this is also implied by our use of formulae from @xcite . while our first applications will follow this approach , it is certainly advantageous to use mixed schemes , which would allow to compute all tree level matrix elements in four dimensions , just as it is often done at nlo .",
    "suitable transition formulae , similar to those of @xcite , will need to be derived in the future .",
    "finally , let us stress that our scheme is constructed in such a way that the momenta of all partons are available together with the integration weight , which allows to obtain arbitrary distributions on the fly .",
    "one may wonder , if the number of sectors will not be a limiting factor to the practical feasibility of the calculation .",
    "this should not be the case , since one should consider the sectors as the analogues of the usual phase space channels . in a monte carlo implementation",
    "one would first choose a sector at random and then the configuration within the sector .",
    "the only true measure of complexity is the structure of the subtraction terms . since they have been derived here using the physical limits it is expected that their number is minimal , and thus the subtraction scheme optimal . of course",
    ", extensions are possible , the most trivial being to add a cut - off on the subtraction phase space .",
    "only practice can show , how important such features will turn out to be .",

    "<S> the result is a laurent expansion in the parameter of dimensional regularization , the coefficients of which should be evaluated by numerical monte carlo integration . </S>",
