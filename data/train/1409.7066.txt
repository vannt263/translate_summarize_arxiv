    "supernovae are important and much - studied astrophysical events .",
    "for example they are the main producers of heavy elements in the universe , and type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) produce most of the iron - group materials @xcite .",
    "sne ia have also been confirmed as the best cosmological ` standard candles ' and as a result there has been a dramatic increase in the rate at which they are observed .",
    "they were integral in the discovery of the acceleration of the universe @xcite , and are now an important cosmological probe in improving the understanding of the nature of the positive cosmological constant .",
    "however the true intrinsic properties of sn ia are not yet fully understood , including their progenitor system and diversity in luminosity ( e.g sn 1991bg , @xcite ) .",
    "there are currently two favoured progenitor scenarios .",
    "the first is a carbon / oxygen white dwarf ( wd ) which accretes mass from a non - electron - degenerate companion star @xcite . in this single degenerate ( sd )",
    "scenario @xcite , the wd can explode when it approaches the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "there are several suggested ways in which this can occur , including a subsonic explosion ( a deflagration ) and a supersonic explosion ( a detonation ) as well as an explosion with a transition to a detonation . in the fully subsonic explosion there is not enough energy to fully power the sn ia and in supersonic explosion there is too much @xmath8ni in the ejecta",
    ". therefore the transition may be the correct explosion model for sn ia @xcite .",
    "two further sd explosions models are fast deflagration and sub - chandrasekhar mass explosions @xcite .",
    "the other suggested progenitor model is a double degenerate ( dd ) scenario , where the sn results from the merger of two wds @xcite .",
    "thanks to the dramatic increase in observations of sn ia , in the last two decades , it is now possible to obtain good spectral time series of them .",
    "these time series can span from before _",
    "b_-band maximum to the nebular phase .",
    "one approach to fully understand the composition and progenitor system of an individual sn ia , is to use mc radiative transfer code and the abundance tomography technique @xcite .",
    "this approach models early time observed spectra , by changing input parameters such as the chemical abundance , bolometric luminosity , photospheric velocity and time since explosion .",
    "the abundance tomography approach exploits the fact that with time deeper and deeper layers of the ejecta become visible . by modelling time series ,",
    "spectral information about the abundances at different depths can be extracted , with this it is possible to reconstruct the abundance stratification from the observational data .",
    "this approach directly links the theoretical models and observed spectra to help one get a true understanding of the early time evolution of a sn ia .",
    "the mc radiative transfer code has been successfully used in modelling many sne ia including 2003du @xcite , 2004eo @xcite and 2011fe @xcite .",
    "we present photometric and spectroscopic data taken with the liverpool telescope ( lt ) and isaac newton telescope ( int ) for sn 2014j , and then apply the aforementioned modelling techniques with the aim of inferring the ejecta properties on the sn .",
    "sn 2014j is a spectrosopically normal sn ia , which has high velocity features .",
    "it is of particular interest as it is the closest sn ia in at least the last 28 years , and possibly the closest in the last 410 years @xcite . as technology",
    "has dramatically improved in this time , this sn gives us a unique opportunity to intensely observe , analyse and model a sn ia with modern technology .",
    "sn 2014j is located at ra=9:55:42 dec=69:40:26.0 ( j2000 ) , and is in m82 which is at a distance of 3.77@xmath50.66 mpc .",
    "this value was obtained from the mean distance from ned , which used 2 methods pnlf ( planetary nebula luminosity function ) and trgb ( tip of the red giant branch ) to derive it .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xcite derive a distance of 3.3 mpc .",
    "m82 is known for having a large amount of star formation ; hence it has a large amount of dust @xcite .",
    "because of this , sn 2014j is highly and unusually reddened .",
    "it does not follow the average galactic reddening law of _ _ r__@xmath2=3.1 .",
    "detailed investigations into the host galaxy extinction were produced by @xcite and @xcite . with our modelling approach ,",
    "we optimise the published extinction values which produce the best - fits of sn 2014j from the spectra .",
    "the paper starts with a report of the observations , which includes 12 spectra taken from 8d to + 10d . in the following section ( section 3 )",
    "we discuss the aperture photometry , including the sdss _ _ g__@xmath9__r__@xmath9__i__@xmath9 light curves . in section 4 we present the fully reduced and calibrated spectra .",
    "the next section ( section 5 ) discusses the monte carlo ( mc ) radiative transfer technique . in section 6 the modelled spectra of 10 early time epochs",
    "are presented and discussed . afterwards",
    "( section 7 ) , we discuss the abundance stratification we have inferred .",
    "finally , the results are summarised and conclusions are drawn from them ( section 8) .",
    "sn 2014j was discovered on 2014/01/21.810 by s.j .",
    "fossey at the ucl observatory @xcite .",
    "the liverpool telescope ( lt ) carried out detailed spectroscopic and photometric observations , starting from 2014/01/22 .",
    "the lt is a 2.0 metre fully robotic telescope located at observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm ) on la palma .",
    "photometric observations were obtained using io : o , an optical imaging camera which has a field of view ( fov ) of 10 arcmin@xmath10 .",
    "the photometric images were acquired in three pass - bands ( sdss _ _ g__@xmath9__r__@xmath9__i__@xmath9 ) .",
    "spectra were obtained using frodospec , a multipurpose integral - field unit spectrograph , at 10 epochs from 8d to + 10d relative to b - band maximum .",
    "frodospec consists of blue and red arms which cover 3900 - 5700    and 5800 - 9400   respectively .",
    "the io : o pipeline carries out basic reduction of photometric data ; this consists of bias subtraction , trimming of the overscan regions and flat fielding .",
    "frodospec has two independent reduction pipelines .",
    "the first one , l1 , performs bias subtraction , overscan trimming and ccd flat fielding ; whereas the second one , l2 , is specific to frodospec @xcite .",
    "it produces sky subtracted row stacked spectra , which were used in this paper .",
    "no host galaxy subtraction has been preformed when analysing the spectra , as no images were available .",
    "however , the sky subtraction routine in the frodospec pipeline removes most of the flux from the m82 , meaning that any flux which has not been subtracted should be negligible .",
    "we also have two spectra obtained using the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) , located at orm on la palma .",
    "the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) , a long - slit spectrograph on the int , was used with the r1200y grating and red+2 camera .",

    "there are strong si ii 6355  , s ii 5454   and 5640    features . due to this",
    "the model requires a photospheric abundance of 12% si and 9% s by mass , with 13% mg to produce the mg ii 4481    line .",

    "this absorption line is produced by our models in a strength consistent with the hst data @xcite .",
    "although we do not cover this uv ca line in our observations , we do have the ca ii ir triplet from which we can infer the ca abundances .",
    "the photospheric ca ii ir triplet is modelled successfully , but there is no attempt to model the high velocity feature .",
    "an iron abundance of 4% is required to produce the fe iii 5150   absorption line .",
    "the @xmath8ni abundance is at 0% , because the ejecta at this epoch are still in the high velocity outer layers of the photosphere .",
    "ti+cr are at a photospheric abundance of 0.3% by mass .",
    "there is a low abundance of c at this high velocity as there are no c spectral features in the optical data , suggesting that all the carbon may be in earlier time spectra , although @xcite do find c i at 1.0693 @xmath15 m .",
    "however , if we add c into the models we find this produces deeper and wider c absorption lines .",
    "therefore the c found in the nir could be due to a very small abundance .",
    "there is a small absorption line in the optical observed at @xmath166200  , where one would expect c , however this line is too narrow and not a c feature .",
    "the model at this epoch produces a particularly good match for the fe ii / mg ii 4200  , s ii 5640    and si ii 6355   features .",

    "there is now a notable excess in flux in the red side of the spectrum due to the black body approximation .",
    "b_-band modelled absolute unreddened magnitude is 18.79 . at this epoch the modelled si iii 4550",
    "   absorption line is not as strong as the previous epochs .",
    "furthermore , in the previous spectrum the 4800   feature which have dominant si ii 5056   and fe ii 5169   absorption lines are merged into one , whereas at this epoch they have two distinct minima .",
    "ca absorption is now more prominent in both the model and the observations , and is seen in the ca ii ir triplet at @xmath168200   .",

    "although the int and lt spectra differ slightly , predominantly in the red side of the spectrum , the main absorption lines in the blue side of the optical are similar between the spectra . due to this the abundances obtained in our analysis would not change if we were to model just the int or lt spectra .",

    "this feature occurs in most of the epochs in the model , and is more dominant in late time spectra .",

    "the effective temperature is 8900 k. the abundances at this epoch are very similar to the previous one , except for @xmath8ni which begins to increase dramatically to 36% , s which decreases to 4% ; si and o also decrease to 10% and 43% respectively . at this epoch",
    "ca stays constant at 2% .",
    "the @xmath0-band unreddened modelled absolute magnitude of this spectra is 18.85 . at this epoch",

    "the modelled s ii 5640   feature is stronger than the observed one ; this is a problem which consistently occurs in the model . to make the s ii the same strength as the observed one it would require the abundance of s to be reduced in the early - epoch models .",
    "however we have chosen to fit the early - time spectra rather than the late time ones , as these can lead us to more information about the high velocity abundances . at this epoch",
    "the o has a photospheric abundance of 0% .",
    "the si and s have also decreased to an abundance of 4% and 2% by mass respectively .",
    "the fe ii 4420   and si ii",
    "6355   lines are modelled successfully . the wide deep absorption line at 8200    is the ca ii ir triplet absorption line ,",
    "the calcium has been reduced to a 1% by mass to decrease the strength of this line",
    ". at this epoch @xmath8ni begins to dominate and is at 88% .",
    "given the sudden jump in the @xmath8ni abundance we can give the constraint that the @xmath8ni distribution will extend to @xmath168000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we thus predict that the characteristic line width of the iron emission in the nebula spectra will be in the order of @xmath168000 km s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum from + 4 d has a luminosity of @xmath22 l@xmath14 and photospheric velocity of v@xmath12=7480 km s@xmath6 .",
    "there is a similar discrepancy between the int and lt data as in the + 1 d plot , however once again this does not affect the abundances we obtain from our fits . from this epoch the absorption lines are beginning to be stronger than the observed ones .",
    "for example , the modelled fe / mg 4300   and fe 4800  features , which are produced by dominant fe iii 4419    and fe ii 5018    absorption lines . however , to refine this fit requires the abundances of these lines at high velocity epochs to be reduced , affecting the early time spectra .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the excess absorption could be due to too much mass at v@xmath12=7480 km s@xmath6",
    ". part of the excess in strength of the @xmath8fe lines could also be due to the decay of @xmath8ni . due to this excess strength in fe ,",

    "the fe ii 4340  , s ii 5606    and fe iii 4419    absorption lines are much deeper in the model than the observations . the unreddened modelled _ b _ and _ v _ magnitudes are 9.5 mag and 9.1 mag respectively .",
    "the next spectrum has a luminosity of @xmath24 l@xmath14 and photospheric velocity is v@xmath12=5950 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath8ni abundance has stayed constant .",
    "the difference between the model and observation begins to differ even more , as shown by the fe ii 4549   line in the 4800   feature . at this epoch",
    "there is a significant amount of @xmath8ni above the photosphere .",
    "therefore it is not unexpected that the difference between the models and observed spectra begins to increase .",
    "the final epoch that was modelled is from + 10 d from _",
    "b_-band maximum .",
    "it has a luminosity of @xmath25 l@xmath14 , a photospheric velocity of v@xmath12=5450 km s@xmath6 and an effective temperature of 7800 k. at this epoch there is no si or s abundance , and the @xmath8ni abundance is the most dominant , at almost 100% . the ca abundance has now decreased to 0% .",
    "we produce an abundance tomography distribution plot for the photospheric layers of the ejecta , see figure [ fig : abundance ] .",
    "this plot demonstrates how the abundances in the early times , from 8 d to + 10 d , of sn 2014j develops .",
    "we can not definitively confirm the abundances of the outermost layers of the ejecta as we do not have spectra before 8d .",
    "the abundances in the outer shell are slightly unusual , in that there is no carbon abundance .",
    "the other notable abundance is fe which begins at 0.1% and rises to 6% .",
    "we have attempted to increase this , but doing so dramatically strengthens the fe 4800   feature at all epochs .",
    "therefore the initial abundances of the outer shell , which has a velocity of 14800 km s@xmath6 , are si 10% , o 78% , s 4% , @xmath8ni 0% , mg 7% , c 0.0% , @xmath8fe 0.1% , with heavier elements making up the remaining abundance . at high velocities , between 8440 - 14800 km s@xmath6",
    ", there is a large oxygen abundance which starts at 78% .",
    "the si distribution starts at 10% due to the strong si ii 6355   feature , and it increases to 17% at 9480 km s@xmath6 before decreases to 0% at 7480 km s@xmath6 .",
    "sulphur also follows a similar distribution with respect to velocity , although it always has a smaller abundance than si .",
    "the sulphur distribution starts at 3.5% before peaking at 12% .",
    "the basic abundance evolution of the ejecta involves o dominating followed by the ime and then by the heavy elements . in the abundance distribution plot ,",
    "figure [ fig : abundance ] , the fe starts at 0.1% and rises to 6% . in figure [ fig : abundance ] the ime elements are significant at high velocities . from this",
    "it can be inferred that the lighter elements may be at even higher velocities .",
    "therefore earlier spectra are needed to gain information about these lighter elements .",
    "as expected from a normal sn ia explosion @xmath8ni dominates the abundance .",
    "this happens between 8440 - 7930 km s@xmath6 , where the @xmath8ni goes from a photospheric mass fraction of 36% to 83% .",
    "the ti+cr abundances stay at a constant level throughout the whole explosion at 0.3% .",
    "calcium starts at 2% at 12300 km s@xmath6 and it decreases to 1% at 5450 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the integrated abundances of the most important elements in the photospheric ejecta , which is at a velocity above 4400 km s@xmath6 , are m(mg)=0.07 m@xmath14 , m(fe)=0.03 m@xmath14 , m(o)=0.40 m@xmath14 , m(s)=0.058 m@xmath14 , m(si)=0.09 m@xmath14 and m(@xmath8ni)=0.47 m@xmath14 .",
    "when the nebular phase spectra is available the @xmath8ni could increase to a total integrated abundance of 0.72 m@xmath26 .",
    "the final total integrated abundances can be confirmed when late time spectra of sn 2014j are observed . due to ground",
    "based telescopes not being able to observe the uv part of the spectra , the iron group element abundances of sn 2014j we have given here may show some 20% uncertainty ( of the values given ) , which nebular modelling will allow us to approve upon .",

    "<S> spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nearby type ia supernova ( sn ia ) sn 2014j are presented . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic observations were taken -8 to + 10 d relative to @xmath0-band maximum , using frodospec , a multi - purpose integral - field unit spectrograph . </S>",
    "<S> the observations range from 3900   to 9000  . </S>",
    "<S> sn 2014j is located in m82 which makes it the closest sn ia studied in at least the last 28 years . </S>",
    "<S> it is a spectrosopically normal sn ia with high velocity features . </S>",
    "<S> we model the spectra of sn 2014j with a monte carlo ( mc ) radiative transfer code , using the abundance tomography technique . </S>",
    "<S> sn 2014j is highly reddened , with a host galaxy extinction of @xmath1=1.2 ( _ _ r__@xmath2=1.38 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has a @xmath3__m__@xmath4 of 1.08@xmath50.03 when corrected for extinction . as sn 2014j </S>",
    "<S> is a normal sn ia , the density structure of the classical w7 model was selected . </S>",
    "<S> the model and photometric luminosities are both consistent with @xmath0-band maximum occurring on jd 2456690.4@xmath50.12 . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of the sn 2014j behaves like other normal sn ia , with significant amounts of silicon ( 12% by mass ) and sulphur ( 9% by mass ) at high velocities ( 12300 km s@xmath6 ) and the low - velocity ejecta ( v@xmath76500 km s@xmath6 ) consists almost entirely of @xmath8ni .    </S>",
