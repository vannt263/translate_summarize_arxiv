    "in his article , basset s approach was based on the fact that the hyperbolic tangent , which is found as the topological solution to the 1 + 1 dimensional partial differential equation for the soliton @xmath3 has the same kink form than the error function .",
    "however , since eq.([kink ] ) is a non - linear equation , it does not give any further guide on how to improve the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "therefore , bassett proposed to extend his approximation using two hyperbolic tangents , as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are parameters to be estimated .    in order to find a succession of functions , where each one becomes an improved approximation to the error function , we propose to look at another physical problem , that of a quantum particle subject to a one dimensional pschl - teller potential .",
    "the time independent schrdinger equation for a particle in the presence of a modified pschl - teller potential @xcite is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and the integer @xmath9 .",
    "infeld and hull @xcite solved the factorization of the hamiltonian of this problem : using dimensionless variables , with @xmath10 , the factorization is realized in terms of the raising and lowering operators @xmath11 where the plus / minus sign is for the lowering / raising operator of the @xmath12 parameter .",
    "for this problem , the energy eigenvalues are @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and the wave functions @xmath15 are found by successive application of the raising operator @xmath16 on the normalized functions @xmath17 for given @xmath12 and @xmath5 , the ground function @xmath18 is given by this function , with @xmath19 .      in eq.([psi0 ] ) , @xmath20 already has the bell shape of the gaussian function for @xmath21 , and the resemblance improves as @xmath12 increases .",
    "since any even power of @xmath22 is easily integrated into a series of hyperbolic tangents , we propose to define the function @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath251,2,3 , ... , which has the asymptotic values @xmath26 a plot of this function for increasing values of the parameter @xmath12 is shown on the left panel of fig.1 , together with the error function . on the right panel",
    "we plot the difference between the error function and the different forms of erf@xmath27(@xmath28 ) , showing that as @xmath12 increases , the difference with respect to the error function decreases .    for integer @xmath12 , the integral in eq.([aerf ] )",
    "is easily evaluated , leading to the series @xmath29 it is interesting to note here that this series is used to find the range of validity of the parameter that determines the susy partner potentials for the pschl - teller problem in qm @xcite .",
    "since the series ( [ aerfser ] ) is defined for all @xmath28 , we have defined an analytical finite series to represent the error function .",
    "now , the parameter @xmath5 only appears in the argument of @xmath30 in eq.([aerfser ] ) , and does not interfere with the asymptotic values in eq.([asimp ] ) ; then , it is possible to use it here as a fine tunning parameter to minimize the maximum difference between the error function and erf@xmath27(@xmath28 ) for all @xmath28 , as can be seen in the right panel of fig.[erff ] . with this approach ,",
    "the maximum difference between the error function and erf@xmath31 is less than 0.0022 for @xmath32 and less than 0.00072 for @xmath33 .",
    ".the values of @xmath5 that minimize the difference erf@xmath34erf@xmath31 , for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabla1 ]    in the left panel of fig.[alfa ] we show how @xmath5 modules the difference erf(@xmath35erf@xmath31 for the case @xmath21 , using only one hyperbolic tangent .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to @xmath36 , and the long - dashed and dash - dotted lines are for @xmath5=1.15 and 1.3 , respectively .",
    "our choice , using the approach explained above , has @xmath37 and is plotted with a solid line , while bassett s case of @xmath38 is plotted using a dotted line . in this case , our choice renders a maximum error which is about half of the maximum error in bassett s approximation .    in table [ tabla1 ] we give the values of @xmath5 which minimize the difference between the error function and erf@xmath31 for different values of @xmath12 . as it is shown in the right panel of fig.([alfa ] ) , the @xmath5 dependence on @xmath12 almost follows the function 1/@xmath39 , but the exact dependence is difficult to find since it involves transcendental functions .",
    "one immediate application when having an analytical approximation to the error function is that one can define a generator for the gaussian function . if @xmath40 represents a probability density function ( p.d.f . )",
    "normalized to unity , defined for @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the corresponding cumulative distribution function , @xmath43 , where the inverse of @xmath44 exists , then if @xmath45 is uniformly generated in ( 0,1 ) , we can find a unique @xmath28 chosen from the p.d.f . by assigning @xmath46 .",
    "here we compare the p.d.f.s obtained when we generated fifty million events using bassett s form for the error function given by eq.(2 ) , and our definition eq.(11 ) for the cases @xmath21 , with @xmath37 , and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "the histograms of randomly generated numbers were fitted using a gaussian function .",
    "if the generator had been exact the width of the gaussian would be @xmath49 .",
    "on the left panel of fig.([gaussgen ] ) we show the fit to events generated using bassett s approximation . on the central and right panel",
    "we show the histograms and fits to events generated using eq.(11 ) with @xmath50 .",
    "the widths obtained in the three cases were 0.7618 , 0.7143 and 0.7071 , respectively . in the case",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath5 was chosen to approximate the correct width .",
    "as it is well known , dawson s function is directly related to the error function of imaginary argument @xcite @xmath51 and its properties are better determined in terms of its derivatives ,    @xmath52    [ dder ]    attempts have been made to find a simple representation of this function in terms of elementary functions , for example , that of cody _",
    "et al._,@xcite who proposed a representation of @xmath44 in terms of rational approximations ,    @xmath53 \\ , , & 5.0 \\leq |x|\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ codyf ]    where @xmath54 are rational functions of degree @xmath55 in the numerator and @xmath56 in the denominator .",
    "obviously , it is not possible to extend our finite series approximation of the error function to dawson s function , and we shall need to use a different approach to find an analytical approximation . but before doing so , we shall show here that there exists a singular susy type relation between dawson s function and its derivatives , and the eigenfunctions of the wrong - sign hermite differential equation , which is found in a susy type factorization of the hamiltonian of the simple harmonic oscillator ( sho).@xcite      in a previous article @xcite we have developed two factorizations of the sho hamiltonian in terms of two non - selfadjoint operators    @xmath57    [ bs ]    in the first factorization , we required that @xmath58 . upon inverting the product , @xmath59 , the two parameter solutions for @xmath60 and @xmath61 defined a sturm - liouville equation which included the quantum mechanics sho equation ,",
    "its susy partners,@xcite and hermite s equation , as particular cases for defined regions of the two - parameter space.@xcite    in a second factorization , we proposed that the hamiltonian be factorized as @xmath62 , which is possible if now the functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 depend on a single parameter , @xmath63 , and are given by @xmath64 the inverse operator product @xmath65 now defines a new eigenvalue equation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a one - parameter self - adjoint operator with the weight function @xmath68 , and it is isospectral to the quantum sho hamiltonian , which is obtained in the limit @xmath69 .",
    "the eigenfunctions in this case are @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the sho eigenfunctions .    for this work ,",
    "it is very interesting to note that in the large limit @xmath72 , one can obtain the wrong - sign hermite s differential equation @xmath73 \\widetilde h_n(x)=0~,\\ ] ] which differs from the hermite equation only in the sign in front of the first derivative .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions are of the quantum oscillator type , but vanishing faster due to a squared exponential factor , @xmath74 .",
    "also , from the hermite polynomials recursion relations it is easy to find the raising and lowering operators for these functions :    @xmath75    [ tildehn ]    note that the reversed sign in the first derivative term of eq.([g - osc ] ) produces these  reversed \" hermite polynomials recursion relations , where @xmath76-th eigenfunction is just the derivative of the previous one .",
    "as one can see , equation ( [ g - osc ] ) is the same as ( [ derkm1 ] ) when @xmath77 and @xmath78 , i.e. , the ground state equation of the wrong - sign hermite eigenvalue problem , whose eigenfunction is just the gaussian function @xmath79 and it is not dawson s function !",
    "now , @xmath80 and f@xmath81 are completely different , and their first derivatives are also different ,    @xmath82    [ dif1a ]    however , they share the same second order differential equation .",
    "the reason for this is that dawson s function is the second solution of equation ( [ g - osc ] ) when @xmath78 , since starting with @xmath80 , that solution is @xmath83 it is even more interesting to see that , using eqs.([dder ] ) , ( [ g - osc ] ) and ( [ tildehn ] ) , we can find a susy like ladder relation between the wrong - sign hermite eigenfunctions @xmath84 , and the derivatives of dawson s functions , which we shall hereafter call the dawson s eigenfunctions , @xmath85 , for @xmath86 , and hence @xmath87 .",
    "this ladder relation is shown in fig.[susyt ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath44 has one zero at @xmath88 , while the gaussian does not have any zero for all finite @xmath28 , implies that in order that both sets of eigenfunctions cover the whole space of non - singular functions @xmath40 , there must exist an additional function @xmath89 , however enlarging the eigenvalue equations for dawson s eigenfunctions .",
    "this feature is the equivalent to the susy - qm procedure , where the zero - th order susy partner eigenfunction is missing . to find the missing @xmath89",
    ", we can see that eq.([dder ] ) , in the case @xmath90 , has two solutions , the constant solution , and the error function .",
    "however , if we assume that the recursion relation ( [ hnmenos ] ) gives rise to eq.([der1 ] ) , then , the ( non - trivial ) zero - th eigenfunction ought to be @xmath91 .",
    "we say here that dawson s eigenfunctions and the wrong - sign hermite eigenfunctions possess a singular susy relation because ( _ i _ ) there is no qm problem associated , ( _ ii _ ) their relation did not arise from an operator procedure ; moreover , they share the recurrence relations and the second order differential equation , ( _ iii _ ) there does not exist an associated susy parameter in this relation , and ( _ iv _ ) in order to cover the space of nonsingular functions of @xmath28 , there must exist a zero - less eigenfunction @xmath89 , which in this case is the constant function .",
    "+   +      in order to find an analytical approximation for dawson s function , let us first notice that the ratio @xmath92 looks very much like a gaussian but with very long tails .",
    "this is the reason why cody s rational approximations ( [ codyf ] ) in terms of series of @xmath93 work pretty well .",
    "given this similarity , a good approximation to dawson s function can be realized in terms of a sum of gaussians , all centered at the origin , and with different widths , @xmath94 the fit of @xmath44 with @xmath95 is shown in the left panel of fig.[dawff ] .",
    "the left @xmath96-axis shows the function values , while the right @xmath96-axis denotes the difference @xmath97 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath98 , a better approximation is given by the relation @xmath99 } { dx } \\right)\\ ] ] which is based on eq.([der1 ] ) .",
    "the right panel of fig.[dawff ] shows the difference @xmath100 between dawson s function and this approximation , which is plotted there for @xmath101 , since it diverges when @xmath102 .",
    "then , we can define a segmented analytical approximation for @xmath44 , the first one defined for @xmath103 , and the second one for @xmath104 , since they match at that point .",
    "in this paper we have derived an analytical approximation for the error function , in terms of a finite series of elementary functions .",
    "this series is derived from the susy factorization of the hamiltonian of a particle subject to a pschl - teller potential . considering another known susy factorization ,",
    "we have defined the dawson eigenfunctions as dawson functions derivatives , since they posses a singular susy type relation with the wrong - sign hermite eigenfunctions .",
    "it would be interesting to make a further analysis of this kind of susy like relations in other spectral problems , as this certainly broadens our knowledge of susy factorizations and the range of validity of the factorization parameters involved .",
    "finally , we proposed a series expansion of dawson s function in terms of gaussian functions .",
