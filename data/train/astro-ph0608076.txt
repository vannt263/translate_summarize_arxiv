    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars represent the final phase in the evolution of very massive stars prior to core - collapse , in which the h - rich envelope has been stripped away via either stellar winds or close binary evolution , revealing products of h - burning ( wn sequence ) or he - burning ( wc sequence ) at their surfaces , i.e. he , n or c , o ( crowther 2007 ) .",

    "the spectroscopic signature of wr stars may be seen individually in local group galaxies ( e.g. massey & johnson 1998 ) , within knots in local star forming galaxies ( e.g. hadfield & crowther 2006 ) and in the average rest frame uv spectrum of lyman break galaxies ( shapley et al . 2003 ) .    in the case of a single massive star ,",

    "consequently , one expects a higher threshold for the formation of wr stars at lower metallicity , and indeed the smc shows a decreased number of wr to o stars than in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "alternatively , the h - rich envelope may be removed during the roche lobe overflow phase of close binary evolution , a process which is not expected to depend upon metallicity .",
    "wr stars represent the prime candidates for type ib / c core - collapse supernovae and long , soft gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",

    "within the local group , m31 ( andromeda ) is the only other candidate metal - rich galaxy , although studies are hindered by its orientation on the sky .",

    "the ubiquitous detection of late wc stars within metal rich environments ( and absence at low metallicity ) requires explanation .",
    "the observed trend for wc subtypes in the lmc versus the milky way was initially believed to originate from a difference in carbon abundances ( smith & maeder 1991 ) , yet quantitative analysis reveals similar carbon abundances ( koesterke & hamann 1995 ; crowther et al .",
    "2002 ) . alternatively",
    ", late wc stars might evolve preferentially from relatively low mass ob stars that enter the wr phase owing to stronger stellar winds at earlier evolutionary phases .",
    "this scenario is not supported by cluster studies ( e.g. massey et al . 2000 ; crowther et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the most compelling evidence suggests that late wc stars are favoured in the case of high wind densities ( crowther et al .",
    "consequently , the presence of late - wc stars within metal - rich galaxies favours metallicity dependent winds for wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the impact of a metallicity dependence for wr winds upon spectral types is as follows . at high metallicity ,",
    "recombination from high to low ions ( early to late subtypes ) is very effective in very dense winds , whilst the opposite is true for low metallicity , low density winds .",
    "stellar temperatures further complicates this picture , such that the spectral type of a wr star results from a subtle combination of ionization and wind density , in contrast with normal stars .",
    "theoretically , nugis & lamers ( 2002 ) argued that the iron opacity peak was the origin of the wind driving in wr stars , which grfener & hamann ( 2005 ) supported via an hydrodynamic model for an early - type wc star in which lines of fe ix - xvii deep in the atmosphere provided the necessary radiative driving .",
    "vink & de koter ( 2005 ) applied a monte carlo approach to investigate the metallicity dependence for cool wn and wc stars revealing @xmath4 where @xmath1=0.86 for wn stars and @xmath1=0.66 for wc stars for 0.1 @xmath5 .",
    "the weaker wc dependence originates from an increasing fe content and constant c and o content at high metallicity .",
    "empirical results for the solar neighbourhood , lmc and smc are broadly consistent with theoretical predictions , although detailed studies of individual wr stars within galaxies broader range in metallicity would provide stronger constraints .    a metallicity dependence of wr winds impacts upon evolutionary model calculations as follows .",
    "recent evolutionary models of meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) allow for rotational mixing , but not a metallicity dependence of wr winds . improved agreement with respect to earlier models",
    "is achieved , but the ratio of wc versus wn stars for continuous star formation does does not reproduce that observed at high metallicity , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ wc_wn ] .",
    "in contrast , recent ( non - rotating ) evolutionary models by eldridge & vink ( 2006 ) in which the vink & de koter ( 2005 ) wr metallicity dependence has been implemented provide a much better match to observations .    with regard to the inferred wr populations at high metallicity",
    "a note of caution is necessary . at high metallicity ,",
    "wr optical recombination lines will ( i ) increase in equivalent width , since their strength scales with the square of the density , and ( ii ) increase in line flux , since the lower wind strength will reduce the line blanketing , resulting in an increased extreme uv continuum strength at the expense of the uv and optical ( crowther & hadfield 2006 ) .",
    "indeed , the equivalent widths of optical emission lines of wn stars in the milky way and lmc wn stars are well known to be higher than smc counterparts ( conti et al .",
    "1989 ) .    to date",
    ", the standard approach for the determination of unresolved wr populations in external galaxies has been to assume metallicity independent wr line fluxes  obtained for milky way and lmc stars ( schaerer & vacca 1998 )  regardless of whether the host galaxy is metal - rich ( mrk 309 , schaerer et al .",
    "2000 ) or metal - poor ( i  zw18 , izotov et al .",
    "ideally , one would wish to use wr template stars appropriate to the metallicity of the galaxy under consideration .",
    "unfortunately , this is only feasible for the lmc , smc and solar neighbourhood , since it is challenging to isolate individual wr stars from ground based observations in more distant galaxies , which span a larger spread in metallicity .",
    "enhanced wr line fluxes are also predicted for wr atmospheric models at high metallicity if one follows the metallicity dependence from vink & de koter ( 2005 ) , such that wr populations inferred from schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) at high metallicity may overestimate actual populations .",
    "indirect hii region studies have suggested a low upper mass limit , @xmath6 , for hii regions at high metallicity ( e.g. thornley et al .",
    "2000 ) , yet schaerer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) claim @xmath7 due to large wr populations in high metallicity galaxies such as mrk  309",
    ". however , schmutz et al . (",
    "1992 ) demonstrated that the ionizing fluxes from wr stars soften as wind density increases .",
    "consequently , a metallicity dependence for wr wind strengths implies that wr ionizing flux distributions soften at increased metallicity , as demonstrated by smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and naturally resolves this apparent discrepancy . for example , high temperature wn models predict a strong ionizing flux shortward of the heii lyman edge at 228  at low metallicities , but negligible hard ionizing fluxes at solar metallicities or above , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ion ] .    to illustrate this",
    ", we use the example of the metal - rich wr galaxy ngc  3049 ( schaerer et al .",
    "gonzalez delgado et al . (",
    "2002 ) identified a compact nuclear starburst cluster as the principal origin of wr emission within ngc  3049 . a nebular analysis based upon the hard ( metallicity - independent )",

    "( 1992 ) confirmed previous results , i.e. @xmath8 .",

    "( 2002 ) led to a normal , @xmath9 , in agreement with uv spectral synthesis studies .",
    "wolf - rayet stars are more common at higher metallicity , as a result of stronger mass - loss during earlier evolutionary phases .",
    "late wc subtypes appear to be signatures of solar metallicity or higher , as witnessed within the westerlund  1 and quintuplet clusters in the inner milky way , m31 , m83 , ngc  3049 , mrk  309 .",
    "the observed trend to later wc subtype is intimately linked to a metallicity dependence of wr stars , in the sense that strong winds preferentially favour late subtypes ( crowther et al .",
