    "it has been conjectured that all natural processes can be understood as the result of computation @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "this statement is contained in wolfram s _ principle of computational equivalence _",
    "@xcite which is closely related to the church - turing thesis @xcite : a computable function ( expressing e.g. a law of physics ) is also effectively calculable ( i.e. its values can be found by some purely mechanical process ) .",
    "this thesis is the base for digital physics , in which the universe is modeled as a giant computer @xcite @xcite @xcite processing the information contained in it .",
    "ideas of digital physics had been independently advanced in the 60 s in the context of quantum mechanics by bastin et al .",
    "@xcite @xcite , and then by noyes and kauffman @xcite @xcite @xcite . in the context of nonlinear dynamics , mccauley and palmore",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite showed how converting real numbers into finite strings of digits from a finite alphabet can capture all dynamical features of chaotic deterministic systems . very recently",
    ", these latter ideas have been systematically explored @xcite by means of @xmath0-calculus @xcite , which constitutes a mathematical formalism for rule - based dynamical systems ( examples being cellular automata @xcite @xcite @xcite and substitution systems @xcite ) .",
    "if one accepts something like the principle of computational equivalence described above , several questions can be raised .",
    "first of all , since computations are assumed to be made with symbols of a finite alphabet , one can ask _ what the size ( cardinal ) @xmath1 of the alphabet should be and what physical meaning is to be attributed to the alphabet s size _ ( note that in this view computations are intended to directly map physical processes ) . in performing computations",
    ", the size of the alphabet coincides with the radix ( base ) in which a number is expressed .",
    "we shall henceforth use the latin word _",
    "radix _ as a synonym for `` base '' to avoid confusion with other uses of the latter word in physics .",
    "because of its obvious , useful connection with boolean algebra , the binary radix has long been considered in the research of discrete physics @xcite @xcite @xcite .    in this article we present a new approach to quantum mechanics inspired by digital physics which gives an answer to the above questions .",
    "the non - commutativity of the continuum spacetime at the quantum level is _ derived _ from our approach .",
    "we claim that _ nature makes dynamically the most effective choice for the radix in which its computations take place_. it is then shown that classical and quantum physics merge together from a single variational principle .",
    "an integer function of the dimensionless lagrangian action @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 denotes the floor function ( lower closest integer ) of @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the lagrangian action and @xmath6 is the planck s constant ) is interpreted as the radix in which the computations that implement the laws of nature take place . _ by demanding that this radix works most efficiently physical laws are derived in a unified way_. the lagrangian action can thus be understood as a key quantity for the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences @xcite .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in section [ radie ]",
    "the central idea of the article , involving a quantity called radix economy ( or digit capacity ) , is presented and illustrated with examples .",
    "the mathematical ( and technological ) relevance of this quantity ( and the natural necessity of having it `` economical '' ) is substantiated in an attempt to provide an easy access to the later developments in the article ( which explore its physical relevance ) . in section [ plre ]",
    "the principle of least radix economy is presented in detail .",
    "three postulates in which our whole approach is based are stated .",
    "we then show how the principle gives rise to two kinds of physical solutions : least action paths and complex wavefunctions .",
    "the hilbert space of quantum mechanics is then systematically constructed .",
    "this is accomplished through the specification of a complete orthonormal base and an inner product that are naturally linked to the structure of the solutions of the principle of least radix economy .",
    "these are classified into symmetry classes through cyclic groups described by the automorphisms that leave invariant each vector of the complete base of the hilbert space . in section [ schro ] the schrdinger equation",
    "is derived , the eikonal approximation and the correspondence principle are proved , and our approach is compared to feynman s path integral formulation ( which is also based on the physical , lagrangian action ) , briefly discussing similarities and differences ( which are not of physical but of mathematical character ) . in section [ noncom ]",
    "we elucidate how the commutativity of spacetime is broken in the quantum realm and we illustrate how the main quantum numbers emerge from the description without need of solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "we also show how finite dimensional hilbert spaces can be naturally accounted for . in section [ statistics ] the physical radix",
    "is related to the mode of certain binomial distributions , whose form is established and discussed .",
    "these concepts are then linked to the possibility of expressing physical dynamical processes as chains of zeroes and ones .",
    "the physical content and meaning of these chains is better understood in terms of the unary radix . in section [ unary ] the unary radix and the consequences of the third postulate of section [ plre ]",
    "are explored and the quantum of action is investigated .",
    "surprisingly , the statistical distribution of the latter provides a key to understanding how minkowski geometry arises locally in spacetime at a classical level .",
    "the quantum of action , together with the principle of least radix economy , allows to understand how different scales , described by different values of the optimal radix , are interrelated and how particles can be equivalent to fields .",
    "special relativity is _ derived _ from these insights and relativistic wave equations that describe particles with spin ( dirac equation ) are also derived . in section [ entropy ]",
    "we show how classical statistical thermodynamics and the second law of thermodynamics emerge from the principle of least radix economy .",
    "finally , in section [ parker ] we explain how our approach encompasses the parker - rhodes combinatorial hierarchy , giving a direct and accessible physical meaning to this intriguing mathematical concept and showing how it indeed provides an argument to establish the value of fundamental physical constants governing the strength of fundamental interactions .",
    "we usually distinguish the physical impact of numbers in terms of the orders of magnitude that they involve .",
    "a related ( but so far unexplored ) approach is to consider the radix in which numbers are expressed .",
    "the decimal radix which we always adopt for representing numbers in physics is just a tacit convention which is not necessarily the most efficient one .",
    "the _ representation _ of all numbers with physical meaning is radix dependent .",
    "for example , if we consider a length of 123 meter , it is understood that we mean @xmath7 m , i.e that we give the number through its representation in the decimal radix . had we used another radix , 50 say , this same representation would yield @xmath8 m and with the same figures we would mean another number , i.e. 2603 m , instead .",
    "we all conventionally ( and tacitly ) agree to represent all our numbers in the same fixed radix so that we can easily compare them ( if we fix the representation instead , we see that by changing the radix we change , e.g. , a length ) .",
    "let @xmath9 ( a natural number ) denote an arbitrary radix .",
    "we can represent any real number @xmath10 in radix @xmath9 as @xmath11 where the upper bound in the sum @xmath12 is the total number of integer digits of @xmath10 in radix @xmath9 @xcite , and @xmath13 is an integer function that returns the digit of @xmath10 that accompanies the @xmath14th - power of @xmath9 when @xmath10 is written in base @xmath9 .",
    "this latter function @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , yields an integer between 0 and @xmath15 and is defined as @xmath16    an important means to quantify the effectiveness of radix @xmath9 to express the number @xmath10 is the _ radix economy _ @xmath17 , also called _ digit capacity _ @xcite @xmath18 this quantity is related to the hardware economy in circuits with multiple valued logic @xcite .",
    "when it is a minimum , we say that radix @xmath9 expresses most efficiently @xmath10 or that @xmath9 has the least radix economy in expressing @xmath10 .",
    "why this quantity is related to hardware economy can be understood as follows : as mentioned above , if we want to give the integer number @xmath10 in base @xmath9 we need @xmath19 figures since the largest power of @xmath9 that is needed to express @xmath10 in radix @xmath9 is @xmath20 and 0 is the lowest power",
    ". each of these figures can be any integer number @xmath21 $ ] which means that , in order to render an arbitrary number of the same order of magnitude as @xmath10 in base @xmath9 each position should be able to accommodate any of the @xmath9 figures .",
    "in a digital device , if one then assumes that one needs , e.g. a number @xmath9 of light - emitting diodes per figure ( a subset of them being illuminated to render any figure between @xmath22 and @xmath15 ) this then means a `` hardware cost '' precisely given by eq .",
    "( [ dcap ] ) , i.e. @xmath9 times the total number of digits of the number to be represented . in the examples above the representation @xmath23 has three digits in both radices @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the numbers associated to this representation have digit capacities @xmath26 for the one in the decimal radix and @xmath27 for the one in radix @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the decimal radix is more economic in this case .",
    "another example to illustrate the concept of radix economy is the following",
    ". suppose that you want to design a pocket calculator to work with numbers whose order of magnitude would never exceed @xmath28 and you envisage to have up until 10 figures of space to represent numbers .",
    "would the decimal radix be the most economic choice in this case ? to answer this question , note that the number @xmath29 needs seven figures to be represented in the decimal radix .",
    "the radix economy would thus be @xmath30 .",
    "however , a more economic radix would be 6 , since @xmath31 is represented as 554200143 in radix 6 , i.e. a number with 9 figures , and hence @xmath32 , which proves to be more economic than the decimal radix : numbers of 9 figures in radix 6 are more economic than numbers of 7 figures in the decimal radix !    from eq .",
    "( [ fund1 ] ) we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the kronecker delta ( i.e. it returns one if @xmath35 and zero otherwise ) .",
    "_ the digit capacity , eq .",
    "( [ dcap ] ) , corresponds to the size of the matrix with elements @xmath36 given by _",
    "@xmath37 which is the _ representation matrix _ of the integer @xmath10 .",
    "the latter is generally rectangular and contains only zeros and ones .",
    "it has @xmath9 rows labelled by index @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 columns , labelled by index @xmath40 .",
    "the matrix has thus size given by eq .",
    "( [ dcap ] ) .",
    "for example , the number @xmath41 reads 102 in radix 3 and , in that radix , it has matrix representation @xmath42 .",
    "its size is @xmath43 , which coincides with @xmath44 given by eq .",
    "( [ dcap ] ) .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ idena ] ) can be written in matrix form , which in this case reads @xmath45 the left and right vectors are fixed .",
    "they have components @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "therefore , _ the matrix representation characterizes each number in each radix in a unique way_.    quite interestingly , for @xmath48 we have @xmath49 since we have @xmath50 with @xmath51 and thus @xmath52    the unary radix @xmath53 does not obey eq .",
    "( [ mag ] ) although it defines the most elementary numeral system ( and the lowest possible bound for a numeral system with a natural base ) and certainly has a useful physical meaning ( as we shall see ) .",
    "this system is a most ancient one .",
    "it appears already in the golenishchev mathematical papyrus , an ancient egyptian papyrus which was most likely written down in the 13th dynasty of egypt ( roughly 1850 bc ) . since zero does not exist in the unary radix , it is not possible to represent with it non - existing things .",
    "this probably explains why the ancient egyptians knew a formula for the volume of a frustum ( i.e. an unfinished pyramid ) but not for the one of a finished pyramid : they did not have the number zero !",
    "( this idea is fully elaborated in @xcite p. 6 . )    in order to represent a natural number @xmath10 in the unary radix @xmath53 , an arbitrarily chosen symbol 1 is repeated @xmath10 times .",
    "this numeral system , thus , transforms any number in the _ number of counts _ in which 1 appears .",
    "addition and subtraction in this radix amounts to concatenate / remove strings of 1 s .",
    "the following examples show how numbers in the decimal radix are written in unary : @xmath54 note that the position of the 1 s is immaterial : all 1 s are indistinguishable ( it does not make sense to talk here about powers of the radix ) .",
    "only their total number is important .",
    "thus , the 1 s behave just as tally marks .",
    "the radix capacity @xmath55 in the unary radix is , thus , trivially @xmath56 since @xmath10 has @xmath10 digits in radix 1 and the alphabet has only one symbol .",
    "thus , the unary radix is the one with the least economy to represent natural numbers @xmath57 ( note that 6 , which is written as 110 in the binary radix , has digit capacity @xmath58 in that radix and , therefore , it is equal to the capacity @xmath59 in the unary radix ) .",
    "we finish these remarks on numeral systems with the trivial case @xmath60 which does not constitute any useful numeral system , but which is , nonetheless , of physical relevance to represent the vacuum . in such radix",
    ", there are no natural numbers @xmath10 to be represented others than @xmath61 .",
    "the radix economy is thus @xmath62 .",
    "such `` radix '' has always the least economy since , trivially , it does not cost anything to represent nothing .",
    "we have seen above that if a number @xmath63 has the same number of digits in radix @xmath64 as it has @xmath65 in radix @xmath66 , then , if @xmath67 so is also @xmath68 .",
    "we note also that a real number @xmath69 in radix @xmath70 has always 10 as integer part since @xmath71 and , therefore , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the fractional part of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , crazy as it may seem , 10 m can denote any arbitrarily large length if we tune the radix in which 10 is expressed ( note , however , that 1 m is always 1 m regardless of the radix used ! ) .",
    "we read in dirac s book @xcite ( p. 3 ) : _ so long as big and small are relative concepts , it is no help explaining the big in terms of the small .",
    "it is therefore necessary to modify classical ideas in such a way so as to give an absolute meaning to size .",
    "_ we now show how the dimensionless lagrangian action @xmath74 , where @xmath6 is the planck constant , can be used to that purpose . along a path @xmath75 connecting two points 1 and 2",
    ", @xmath5 is an scalar functional @xmath76 given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the lagrangian , @xmath79 denotes time , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the generalized position and velocity vectors evaluated along the path .",
    "when @xmath74 is large the physical trajectories are governed by the principle of least action @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the first - variation operator , @xmath84 is a scalar and @xmath85 is an arbitrary function .",
    "the extremization of the action leads to the euler - lagrange equations describing the physical trajectories @xmath86 \\label{euler}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the total number of degrees of freedom in the system and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the @xmath90-th component of the generalized position and velocity vectors , respectively .",
    "an equivalent formulation of the equations of motion is provided by the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath91 which implies the following relationships involving the hamiltonian @xmath92 and generalized momenta @xmath93 as @xmath94 when @xmath74 is small , there are no longer well defined unique trajectories along which the motion of the system takes place .",
    "rather , infinitely many choices are possible and one is forced to speak about the probability of finding a certain physical state .",
    "this is a most striking fact in quantum mechanics : when the action @xmath5 is of the order of @xmath6 the physical laws seem very different to when @xmath74 is large .",
    "thus , the ( generally real ) number @xmath74 suggests a way to give an absolute meaning to size , breaking the relativity of big and small .",
    "the question thus arises as whether we can extract a physical radix from the real - valued quantity @xmath74 which is to be considered as the characteristic `` physical length '' of a certain dynamical process .",
    "if we introduce the natural demand that the radix ( an integer ) should increase _ linearly _ on the integers as does @xmath74 on the reals , a straightforward way to achieve this is to take @xmath2 as the physical radix by observing that @xmath95 i.e. that @xmath74 is the sum of its integer and its fractional parts .",
    "the r.h.s . is the sum of two nonlinear discontinuous functions on the reals , the integer - valued function @xmath96 which is a _ staircase _ with discrete jumps at each integer value of @xmath74 ( and which strongly approaches @xmath74 for @xmath5 large , being always _ linear _ on the integers ) , and the real - valued function @xmath97 , which is a _ periodic _ function of @xmath74 ( taking values between @xmath22 and @xmath98 ) with the form of a sawtooth wave , being discontinuous at the integer values of @xmath74 and _ linear _ everywhere else .",
    "the principle of least action only works _ asymptotically _ , when @xmath74 is large .",
    "in such limit @xmath97 can be neglected and we have , as already mentioned @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ zerteilt ] ) , we obtain @xmath100 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ mag ] ) in getting to the last equality .",
    "this , therefore , leads to reinterpret the _",
    "least ( classical ) action paths _ as being _ those for which the radix @xmath101 is most efficient _",
    ", i.e. _ those paths for which the radix @xmath2 has the least economy_. with `` efficiency '' we mean those laws which extremize the digit capacity , eq .",
    "( [ dcap ] ) , with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "as we have seen above this efficiency represents an _ actual mathematical efficiency _ since it also means that the matrix representations of physical numbers , eq .",
    "( [ matrep ] ) , have the _ lowest _ size .",
    "we propose that this principle of least radix economy holds _ generally _ ( also in situations where @xmath74 is not necessarily large ) thus providing foundations for classical and quantum mechanics and statistical thermodynamics as well . in the next sections we substantiate this claim .",
    "note that @xmath101 is an _ integer - valued discontinuous function _ and the first variation operator , infinitesimally acts on well - behaved ( real - valued ) functionals . from a mathematical point of view",
    "this would seem a major violence ( belonging to the kind of problems mentioned in @xcite , p. 28 ) .",
    "however , by noting that @xmath104 and @xmath97 is a periodic function we have @xcite @xmath105 we claim that this fourier series , which converges to @xmath106 everywhere when @xmath74 is noninteger , is a _ physically meaningful _ representation of @xmath106 even at the discontinuities @xmath74 integer ( where gibbs phenomenon takes place @xcite ) .    together with the decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ zerteilt ] ) a mathematical result that we shall frequently use is the following .",
    "we note that @xmath107 and therefore @xmath108 this means that @xmath109 is equal to its fractional part @xmath110 .",
    "thus @xmath111 and we also have , therefore , @xmath112",
    "we have thus seen that a fixed radix is not always the most efficient choice in all situations involving representations of numbers ( e.g. the example of the pocket calculator above ) .",
    "of course , _ in any specific scale the description of physical laws is not affected in any way by the choice of the radix since the latter is merely an ( equivalent ) representation of the numbers_. since physics is not scale invariant ( from the considerations made in the previous section on the role of @xmath74 ) there is , however , a fundamental physical radix : _ the one which most efficiently works at each scale_. furthermore , _ the fundamental radix establishes the form that physical laws do have at each scale_. we propose that nature has her own _ dynamical _ means to specify the most efficient radix .",
    "using action as our guide , we thus introduce the following postulates .",
    "+    we shall discuss postulate * c * in section [ unary ] and case ( b ) of postulate @xmath113 in section [ entropy ] .",
    "we now focus on case ( a ) of postulate @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",

    "this proves the result .",

    "the second corollary is that _ if @xmath74 is a rational solution , there generally exist physical paths with @xmath150 integer and @xmath151 which necessarily correspond to least - action trajectories_. this result may be helpful in understanding subtleties of the semiclassical regime which proved to be stumbling blocks for the old quantum theory . for example , it provides an explanation of why the heisenberg semiclassical quantization of the helium atom with half - integer quantum numbers seemed to work well in certain cases . because of symmetry considerations , the quantum physical state of the helium atom , having two electrons , appears to be naturally described by the member @xmath152 , which induces solutions @xmath153 with a @xmath154 symmetry in @xmath141 [ although we must refrain from giving a detailed calculation here , that this should be the case is because this symmetry group naturally reflects the exchange degeneracy of the two electrons ( see e.g. @xcite , p. 480 ) ] .",
    "because of the symmetry eq.([sime ] ) , there exist states with @xmath155 integer which correspond to half - integer values for the action @xmath156 .",

    "( i.e. when the dynamical variables do not change in many orders of magnitude ) are _ not _ affected by how actual numbers are indeed represented . in the quest for a unified theory of physics , we propose that the radix change provides the necessary degree of freedom ( _ not _ a free parameter ) to bring physics at all scales together .",
    "we also propose that nature dynamically exploits this radix change and that this explains the wave - particle duality found in the quantum realm ( and the least action principle in the classical realm ) .",
    "we claim that the quantum of action ( naturally described by the unary radix ) is the main building block in defining any physical action ( as we have shown through the explicit construction of the kinetic energy term ) .",
    "we thus suggest that there exists a `` radix relativity '' that concerns the physical action and which , together with the conservation laws related to the symmetries of the action itself through noether s theorem , needs to be accounted for in order to better understand the wide variety of dynamical behavior found in the universe ( and why classical determinism and quantum mechanics _ coexist _ within the same physical reality ) .",
