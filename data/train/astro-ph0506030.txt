    "2005 ) .",
    "the main advantage of weak lensing is that it directly probes the distribution of matter in the universe .",

    "the weak lensing constraints are especially effective when some redshift information is available for the source galaxies ; use of redshift tomography can improve the cosmological constraints  by factors of a few ( hu 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , measurements of the weak lensing bispectrum ( takada & jain 2004 ) and purely geometrical tests ( jain & taylor 2003 , bernstein & jain 2004 , zhang et al .",
    "2003 , song & knox 2004 , hu & jain 2004 , bernstein 2005 ) lead to significant improvements of accuracy in measuring the cosmological parameters . when these methods are combined , weak lensing by itself is expected to constrain the equation of state of dark energy @xmath5 to a few percent , and impose interesting constraints on the time variation of @xmath5 .",
    "ongoing or planned surveys , such as the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey , the dark energy survey ( des ) , panstarrs and vista are expected to significantly extend lensing measurements , while the ultimate precision will be achieved with the supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ; aldering et al .",
    "2004 ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .    however , so far the rosy weak lensing parameter accuracy predictions that have appeared in literature have not allowed for the presence of systematics ( exceptions are ishak et al .  ( 2004 ) and knox et al .",

    "this is not surprising , as we are just starting to understand and study the full budget of systematic errors present in weak lensing measurements .",
    "nevertheless , some recent work has addressed various aspects of the systematics , both experimental and theoretical , and ways to correct for them .",
    "for example , vale et al .",
    "( 2004 ) estimated the effects of extinction on the extracted shear power spectrum , while hirata & seljak ( 2003 ) , hoekstra ( 2004 ) and jarvis & jain ( 2004 ) considered the errors in measurements of shear .",
    "several studies explored the effect of theoretical uncertainties ( white 2004 , zhan & knox 2004 , huterer & takada 2004 ) and ways to protect against their effects ( huterer & white 2005 ) .",
    "it has been pointed out that second - order corrections in the shear predictions can be important ( schneider et al .",

    "2005 ) .    despite these efforts , we are at an early stage in our understanding of weak lensing systematics .",
    "realistic assessments of systematic errors is likely to impact strategies for measuring the weak lensing shear ( bernstein 2002 , bernstein & jarvis 2002 , rhodes et al .",
    "2004 ,  mandelbaum et al.2005 ) .",
    "eventually we would like to bring weak lensing to the same level as cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( cmb ) and type ia supernovae , where the systematic error budget is better understood and requirements for the control of systematic precisely outlined ( e.g. tegmark et al .",

    "2003 , linder & miquel 2004 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce the framework for the discussion of systematic errors in weak lensing measurements and outline requirements for several generic types of systematic error .",
    "the reason that we do _ not _ consider specific sources of error ( e.g. temporal variations in the telescope optics or fluctuations in atmospheric seeing ) is that there are many of them , they strongly depend on a particular survey considered , and they are often poorly known before the survey has started collecting data .",
    "instead we argue that , at this early stage of our understanding of weak lensing systematics , it is more practical and useful to consider three generic types of error  multiplicative and additive error in measurements of shear , as well as redshift error .",
    "these generic errors are useful intermediate quantities that link actual experimental sources of error to their impact on cosmological parameter accuracy . in fact",
    ", realistic systematic errors for any particular experiment can in general be converted to these three generic systematics .",
    "given the specifications of a particular survey , one can then estimate how much a given systematic degrades cosmological parameters .",
    "this can be used to optimize the design of the experiment to minimize the effects of systematic errors on the accuracy of desired parameter .",
    "for example , accurate photometric redshift requirements will lead to requirements on the number of filters and their wavelength coverage .",
    "similarly , the requirements on multiplicative and additive errors in shear will determine how accurate the sampling of the point spread function needs to be .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in   [",
    "sec : method ] we discuss the survey specifications and cosmological parameters in this study . in   [ sec : parameterization ] we describe the parameterization of systematic errors . in ",
    "[ sec : redshift]-[sec : additive ] we present the requirements on the systematic errors for the power spectrum , while in   [ sec : bispec ] we study the requirements when both the power spectrum and the bispectrum are used .",
    "we combine the redshift and multiplicative errors and discuss trends in   [ sec : discussion ] and conclude in ",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we express the measured convergence power spectrum as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the measured power spectrum with systematics ( see the next section on how it is related to the no - systematic power spectrum @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is the variance of each component of the galaxy shear and @xmath10 is the average number of resolved galaxies in the @xmath11th redshift bin per steradian .",
    "the convergence power spectrum at a fixed multipole @xmath12 and for the @xmath11th and @xmath13th redshift bin is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the comoving angular diameter distance and @xmath16 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the weights @xmath17 are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the comoving radial distance and @xmath21 is the fraction of galaxies assigned to @xmath11th redshift bin .",
    "we employ the redshift distribution of galaxies of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is survey dependent and specified below .",
    "the cosmological constraints can then be computed from the fisher matrix @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the column matrix of the observed power spectra and @xmath26 is the inverse of the covariance matrix between the power spectra whose elements are given by @xmath27 =   { \\delta_{\\ell \\ell'}\\over ( 2\\ell+1)\\,f_{\\rm sky}\\,\\delta \\ell}\\ , \\left [ \\hat{c}^{\\kappa}_{ik}(\\ell ) \\hat{c}^{\\kappa}_{jl}(\\ell ) +     \\hat{c}^{\\kappa}_{il}(\\ell ) \\hat{c}^{\\kappa}_{jk}(\\ell)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : cov}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 is the band width in multipole we use , and @xmath29 is the fractional sky coverage of the survey .",
    "in addition to any nuisance parameters describing the systematics , we consider six or seven cosmological parameters and assume a flat universe throughout .",
    "the six standard parameters are energy density and equation of state of dark energy @xmath30 and @xmath5 , spectral index @xmath31 , matter and baryon physical densities @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the amplitude of mass fluctuations @xmath4 .",
    "note that @xmath34 provides useful information about the sensitivity of an arbitrary @xmath35 , since the best - measured mode of any @xmath35 is about as well measured as @xmath34 and therefore is subject to similar degradations in the presence of the systematics .",
    "it is this particular mode , being the most sensitive to generic systematics , that will drive the accuracy requirements  we explicitly illustrate this in fig . [",
    "fig : z ] .",
    "in addition to the constant @xmath5 case , we also consider a commonly used two - parameter description of dark energy @xmath36 ( linder 2003 ) where @xmath2 becomes the seventh cosmological parameter in the analysis . throughout",
    "we consider lensing tomography with 7 - 10 equally spaced redshift bins ( see below ) , and we use the lensing power spectra on scales @xmath37 .",
    "we hold the total neutrino mass fixed at @xmath38 ev ; the results are somewhat dependent on the fiducial mass .",
    "we compute the linear power spectrum using the fitting formulae of eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) .",

    "note that there is some ambiguity in the definition of the number density of galaxies @xmath43 ; it is the quantity @xmath44 that determines the shear measurement noise level , where @xmath41 is the intrinsic shape noise of each galaxy .",
    "the surveys are assumed to have the source galaxy distribution of the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nz ] ) which peaks at @xmath45 . for the fiducial snap and",
    "lsst surveys we assume tomography with 10 redshift bins equally spaced out to @xmath46 , as future photometric redshift accuracy will enable relatively fine slicing in redshift .",
    "for the des , we assume a more modest 7 redshift bins out to @xmath47 , reflecting the shallower reach of the des while keeping the redshift bins equally wide ( @xmath48 ) as in the other two surveys .",
    "finally , we do not use weak lensing information beyond @xmath49 in order to avoid the effects of baryonic cooling ( white 2004 , zhan & knox 2004 , huterer & takada 2004 ) and non - gaussianity ( white & hu 2000 , cooray & hu 2001 ) , both of which contribute more significantly at smaller scales . while there may be ways to extend the useful @xmath12-range to smaller scales without risking bias in cosmological constraints ( huterer & white 2005 ) , extending the measurements to @xmath50 would improve the marginalized errors on cosmological parameters by only about 30% ( e.g.  white & hu 2000 ) . ] .",
    "the parameter fiducial values and accuracies are summarized in table [ tab : errors ] near the end of the article .",
    "the fiducial values for the parameters not listed in table [ tab : errors ] are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54ev .",
    "it is well known that measurements of the angular power spectrum of the cmb , such as those expected by the planck experiment , can help weak lensing constrain the cosmological parameters . in particular",
    ", the morphology of the peaks in the cmb angular power spectrum contains useful information on the physical matter and baryon densities , while the locations of the peaks help constrain the dark energy parameters .",
    "however we checked that , when the planck prior added , all systematics requirements become weaker ( relative to those with weak lensing alone ) since the planck information is not degraded with systematic errors even if weak lensing information is . in order to be conservative , we decided not to add the planck cmb information",
    ". therefore , we consider the systematics requirements in weak lensing surveys alone , and note that addition of complementary information from other surveys typically weakens these requirements .",
    "as mentioned above , we consider three generic sources of error .",
    "we believe that the parameterizations we propose , especially for the redshift and multiplicative shear errors , are general enough to account for the salient effects of any generic systematic .",
    "the additive shear error is more model - dependent , and while we motivate a parameterization we believe is reasonable at this time , further theoretical and experimental work needs to be done to understand additive errors .",
    "we parameterize the redshift , multiplicative shear and additive shear errors as follows .",
    "measurements of galaxy redshifts are necessary not only for the redshift tomography  which significantly improves the accuracy in measuring dark energy parameters  but also to obtain the fiducial distribution of galaxies in redshift , @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , understanding and correcting for the redshift uncertainties is crucial , and comparison studies between currently used photometric methods , such as that initiated by cunha et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , are crucial .",
    "it is important to emphasize that statistical errors in photometric redshifts do not contribute to the error budget if they are well characterized . in other words ,",
    "if we know precisely the distribution of photometric redshift errors ( that is , all of its moments ) at _ each redshift _ , we can use the measured photometric distribution , @xmath56 , to recover the original spectroscopic distribution , @xmath57 very precisely . in practice",
    "we will not know the redshift error distribution with arbitrary precision , rather we will typically have some prior knowledge of the mean bias and scatter at each redshift .",
    "the quantity we consider in this paper is the uncalibrated redshift bias , that is , the residual ( after correcting for the estimated bias ) offset between the true mean redshift and the inferred mean photometric redshift at any given @xmath58 .",
    "a more general description of the redshift error would include the scatter in the redshift error at each @xmath58 .",
    "such an analysis has recently been performed by ma , hu & huterer ( 2005 ) who found that , even though the scatter is important as well , the mean bias in redshift is the dominant source of error .    unlike ma , hu & huterer ( 2005 ) who hold the overall distribution of galaxies in redshift @xmath55 fixed and only allow variations in the tomographic bin subdivisions , we allow the redshift error to affect the overall @xmath55 as well . at this time it is not clear how the photometric error will affect the source galaxy distribution @xmath55 as it depends on how the source galaxy distribution will be determined .",
    "we assume that the source galaxy distribution @xmath55 is obtained from the same photometric redshifts used to subdivide the galaxies into redshift bins .",
    "an alternative possibility is that information about the overall distribution of source galaxies is obtained from an independent source ( say , another survey ) while the internal photometric redshifts are only used to subdivide the overall distribution into redshift bins .",
    "the two approaches , ours and that of ma , hu & huterer ( 2005 ) , are therefore complementary and both should be studied . as discussed in the conclusions ,",
    "it is reassuring that the two approaches give consistent results .",
    "we consider two alternative parameterizations of the redshift error : the centroids of redshift bins , and the chebyshev polynomial expansion of the mean bias in the @xmath59 relation .",
    "we now describe them .",
    "we first consider the centroid of each photometric redshift bin as a parameter .",
    "any scatter in galaxy redshifts in a given tomographic bin will average out , to first order leaving the effect of an overall bias in the centroid of this bin .",
    "[ recall , the part of the bias that is uncalibrated and has not been subtracted out is what we consider here . ] as discussed by huterer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the context of number - count surveys , this approach captures the salient effects of the redshift distribution uncertainty .",
    "note , however , that the centroid shifts do not capture the `` catastrophic '' errors where a smaller fraction of redshifts are completely misestimated and reside in a separate island in the @xmath59 plane",
    ".    we therefore have @xmath60 new parameters , where @xmath60 is the number of redshift bins . to compute the fisher derivatives for these parameters , we vary each centroid by some value @xmath61 , that is , we shift the whole bin by @xmath61 .",
    "as mentioned above , this procedure not only allows for the fact that the tomographic bin divisions are not perfectly measured , but it also deforms the overall distribution of galaxies @xmath55 .    while the required accuracy of redshift bin centroids provides useful information , it is sometimes difficult to compare it with directly observable quantities . in reality ,",
    "an observer typically starts with measurements of photometric redshifts which are not equal to the true , spectroscopic ones : the quantity @xmath59 may have a nonzero value  the bias  and also nonzero scatter around the biased value .",
    "therefore , it is sometimes more useful to consider requirements on the accuracy in the @xmath59 relation .    detailed forms of the bias and scatter are typically complicated and depend on the photometric method used and how well we are able to mimic the actual observations and correct for the biases .",
    "we write the redshift bias as a sum of @xmath62 smooth functions ",
    "chebyshev polynomials centered at @xmath63 and extending from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 ( 3.0 for snap and lsst , 2.1 for the des ) is the extent of the distribution of galaxies in redshift . [ we briefly review the chebyshev polynomials in the appendix . ]",
    "the relation between the photometric and true , spectroscopic redshifts is then    @xmath67 z_s^*&\\equiv & { z_s - z_{\\rm max}/2\\over z_{\\rm max}/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath68 are the coefficients that parameterize the bias . as with the centroids of redshift bins ,",
    "we do not model the scatter in the @xmath59 relation as one can show that the effect of uncalibrated bias is dominant ( ma , hu & huterer , 2005 ) .",
    "the effect of imperfect redshift measurements is to shift the distribution of galaxies away from the true distribution @xmath57 to a biased one @xmath56 .",
    "the biased distribution of galaxies then propagates to bias the cosmological parameters .",
    "the photometric distribution can then simply be obtained from the true distribution as ( e.g.  padmanabhan et al .",
    "2005 )    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the probability that the galaxy at redshift @xmath58 is measured to be at redshift @xmath71 .",
    "since we are not modeling the scatter in the @xmath59 relation , the probability is a delta function    @xmath72    since we will include the @xmath68 as additional parameters , with fiducial values @xmath73 , we shall need to take derivatives with one nonzero @xmath68 at a time and therefore we can assume @xmath74 for a single @xmath11 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath75 for a function @xmath76 , where the sum runs over the roots of the equation @xmath77 , and further using a recursive formula for the derivative of the chebyshev polynomial ( arfken 2000 ,   13.3 ) , we get    @xmath78 }     { \\displaystyle}\\left [ -iz_at_i(z_a^*)+it_{i-1}(z^*_a)\\right ] { \\displaystyle}\\right | } \\label{eq : np_final}\\ ] ]    where the sum runs over all roots of the equation @xmath79 , with ( recall ) @xmath80 .",
    "this is the expression for the perturbed distribution of galaxies due to a single perturbation mode . , eq .",
    "( [ eq : np_final ] ) simplifies to @xmath81 we use it , together with the original distribution @xmath55 , to compute the perturbed and unperturbed convergence power spectra and thus take the derivative with respect to @xmath68 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nz_pert ] we show the photometric galaxy distributions @xmath56 for the select three chebyshev modes ( first , second and seventh ) of perturbation to the distribution of galaxies @xmath55 corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaz_vs_zs ] , together with the original unperturbed distribution .",
    "the distributions are shown for the des and snap .",
    "since the incorrect assignment of photometric redshifts only redistributes the galaxies , we always impose the requirement @xmath82 regardless of the perturbation .",
    "note that snap s fiducial @xmath55 is broader , making the resulting wiggles in @xmath56 less pronounced and helping the weak lensing measurements be less susceptible to the redshift biases .",
    "( as shown in ",
    "[ sec : redshift_centroids ] , this effect is counteracted by the smaller fiducial errors in the snap survey which lead to more susceptibility to biases . )      the multiplicative error in measuring shear can be generated by a variety of sources .",
    "for example , a circular psf of finite size is convolved with the true image of the galaxy to produce the observed image , and in the process it introduces a multiplicative error .",
    "let @xmath83 and @xmath84 be the estimated and true shear of a galaxy at some true ( spectroscopic ) redshift @xmath85 and direction @xmath86 .",
    "then the general multiplicative factor @xmath87 acts as    @xmath88\\ ] ]    where @xmath89 is the multiplicative error in shear which is both direction and time dependent .",
    "we can write the error as a sum of its mean ( average over all directions and redshifts in that tomographic bin ) and a component with zero mean ,    @xmath90    where @xmath91 and @xmath92 and the averages are taken over angle and over redshift within the @xmath11th redshift bin .",
    "then we can write    @xmath93       & \\simeq &     \\langle \\gamma(z_{s , i } , { \\bf n } )                       \\gamma(z_{s , j } , { \\bf n } + d{\\bf n})\\rangle                       ( 1+f_i+f_j)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we dropped terms of order @xmath94 .",
    "since the random component of the multiplicative error is uncorrelated with shear , all terms of the form @xmath95 are zero .",
    "finally , terms of the form @xmath96 are taken to be small , thus requiring that @xmath97 is smaller than @xmath89 and @xmath98 ( guzik and bernstein , 2005 ) . therefore @xmath99",
    "\\label{eq : mult}\\ ] ]    where again we emphasize that @xmath89 is the irreducible part of the multiplicative error in @xmath11th redshift bin ( i.e.  its average over all directions _ and _ the @xmath11th redshift slab ) .",
    "it is clear that multiplicative errors are potentially dangerous , since they lead to an error that goes as @xmath89 and not @xmath100 .",
    "finally , note that shear calibration is likely to depend on the size of the galaxy , so that the mean error @xmath89 is the error averaged over all galaxy sizes in bin @xmath11 .",
    "additive error in shear is generated , for example , by the anisotropy of the psf .",
    "we define the additive error via    @xmath101    let us assume that the additive error is uncorrelated with the _ true _ shears so that the term @xmath102 is zero .",
    "furthermore , let the legendre transform of the term @xmath103 be @xmath104 .",
    "then we can write @xmath105    we now have to specify the additive systematic power @xmath106 .",
    "consider some known sources of additive error : for example , the additive error induced due to a non - circular psf is roughly @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the ellipticity of the psf and @xmath109 is the ratio of squares of the psf and galaxy size ( e. sheldon , private communication ) ; galaxies that are smaller therefore have a larger additive error .",
    "of course , the observer needs to correct the overall trend in the error , leaving only a smaller residual , and the impact of this residual is what we are interested in . it should be clear from this discussion that the additive error in shear can be calibrated by a part that depends on the average size of a galaxy at a given redshift multiplied by a random component that depends on the part of the sky observed .",
    "therefore , we write the additive shear as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the characteristic additive shear amplitude in the @xmath11th redshift bin and @xmath112 is a random fluctuation .    in multipole space ,",
    "the two point function can then be expressed as @xmath113 times the angular part which only depends on @xmath114 .",
    "note that the additive error for two galaxies at different redshifts ( i.e.  when @xmath115 ) is not zero , although it may in principle be suppressed relative to the additive error for the auto - power spectra ( when @xmath116 ) .",
    "motivated by such considerations , we assume the additive systematic in multipole space of the form    @xmath117    where the correlation coefficient @xmath118 describes correlations between bins . the coefficient @xmath118 is always set to unity for @xmath116 , and for @xmath119 it is fixed to some fiducial value ( not taken as a parameter in the fisher matrix ) . while the discussion above would imply that @xmath120 for all @xmath11 and @xmath13 , we allow for the possibility that the additive errors are not perfectly correlated across redshift bins . in the extreme case of uncorrelated additive errors in different @xmath58 bins ,",
    "the cross - power spectra are not affected , @xmath121 .",
    "we shall see that the results are weakly dependent on the fiducial value of @xmath118 unless if @xmath122 identically .    for the multipole dependence of @xmath123",
    "we assume a power - law form , and marginalize over the index @xmath124 .",
    "we choose @xmath125 , near the `` sweet spot '' of weak lensing surveys , but note that this choice is arbitrary and made solely for our convenience since @xmath126 is degenerate with the parameters @xmath111 .",
    "our _ a priori _ expectation for the value of @xmath124 is uncertain , and we try several possibilities but find ( as discussed later ) that the results are insensitive to the value of @xmath124 .",
    "we therefore have a total of @xmath127 nuisance parameters for the additive error ( @xmath60 parameters @xmath111 , plus @xmath124 ) .    in practice",
    "there is no particular reason why an additive systematic would be expected to conform to a power law , so in the future we should consider an additive systematic with more freedom in its spatial behavior .",
    "the current treatment is optimistic : fixing the systematic to a power law gives it an identifying characteristic that allows us to distinguish it from cosmological signals .",
    "without such a characteristic , the systematic could be much more damaging .      with the systematic errors we consider ,",
    "the resulting theoretical convergence power spectrum is    @xmath128 + \\rho\\ , b_ib_j    \\left ( { \\ell\\over \\ell_*}\\right ) ^{\\alpha}.\\ ] ]    the derivatives with respect to the multiplicative and additive parameters are trivial since they enter as linear ( or power - law ) coefficients , while the derivatives with respect to the redshift parameters @xmath129 ( really , parameters @xmath68 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cheb_expansion ] ) ) need to be taken numerically .",
    "we have a total of @xmath130 parameters , and we marginalize over the @xmath60 redshift bin centroids by giving them identical gaussian priors . while the actual redshift accuracy may be better in some redshift ranges than in others , the required accuracy that we obtain in our approach will pertain to the redshift bins where observations are most sensitive ( i.e. at intermediate redshifts @xmath131 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : z ] shows the degradation in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath132 , and also @xmath133 and @xmath2 , accuracies as a function of our prior knowledge of the redshift bin centroids . here and in the subsequent two figures ,",
    "the plots are shown separately for each of the three surveys ( des , snap and lsst ) .",
    "since we are using the fisher matrix formalism without external priors on cosmological parameters , the cosmological parameter degradations ( as well as accuracies ) clearly remain unchanged for an arbitrary @xmath134 if we also scale the priors on the nuisance parameters by @xmath135 . in these and subsequent plots",

    "these are fairly stringent requirements , in rough agreement with results found by ma , hu & huterer ( 2005 ) .",
    "it might seem a bit surprising that the snap and des requirements are comparable , given that the fiducial snap survey is more powerful than the des ( see table [ tab : errors ] ) and hence would need better control of the systematics .",

    ", it is interesting to consider whether the weak lensing survey can self - calibrate  ,",
    "i.e.  determine both the cosmological and the nuisance parameters concurrently .",
    "this is partly motivated by the self - calibration of cluster count surveys , where it has been shown that one can determine the cosmological parameters and the evolution of the mass - observable relation  provided that the latter takes a relatively simple deterministic form ( e.g.levine , schulz & white 2002 , majumdar & mohr 2003 , hu 2003b , lima & hu 2004 ) . figure  [ fig : mult ] shows that the fiducial des and snap surveys can self - calibrate with about a 100% degradation in cosmological parameter errors ( and lsst with about a 150% degradation ) . while doubling the error in cosmological parameters is a somewhat steep price to pay , it is very encouraging that all surveys enter a self - calibrating regime where only the higher - order moments of the error contribute to the total error budget . in   [ sec : bispec ] we show that the inclusion of bispectrum information can significantly improve the self - calibration regime .",
    "as explained in   [ sec : add_define ] , we adopt the additive error of the form    @xmath167    which adds that amount of noise to the convergence power spectra .",

    "the observed degradation in cosmological parameters is clearly due to the increased sample variance that the additional power puts onto the measurement of the power spectrum . when @xmath120 , this sample variance is confined to a single mode of the shear covariance matrix , so that the maximum damage is limited and we observe the self - calibration plateau in fig .",
    "[ fig : add_error ] .",
    "we have tried varying a number of other details :    * using different values of the coefficient @xmath118 for @xmath115 in the range @xmath176 . * changing the fiducial value of the exponent @xmath124 from @xmath177 to @xmath178 or @xmath179 . * adding a 10% prior to the @xmath111 ( rather than no prior ) . * using the redshift independent fiducial values of the coefficients @xmath111 . *",

    "interestingly , we find that the overall requirements are very weakly dependent on any of the above variations , and the requirements almost always look roughly like those in figure [ fig : add_error ] .",
    "in particular , the results are essentially insensitive to reasonable priors of any of the nuisance parameters , since the @xmath111 can be determined internally to an accuracy much better than @xmath111 for all but the smallest ( @xmath180 ) fiducial values of these parameters .",
    "therefore the dominant effect by far is the fiducial value of @xmath111 and the increased sample variance that it introduces .    the only interesting exception to this insensitivity is allowing the @xmath115 value of the coefficients @xmath118 to be very close to unity . in the extreme case when @xmath181 for @xmath115 , the degradation asymptotes to @xmath182",
    "even with very large @xmath111 since in that case the additive errors add a huge contribution to _ all _ power spectra , and one can mathematically show that the resulting errors in cosmological parameters do not change more than @xmath183 irrespective of the systematic error . in practice , however , @xmath184 for @xmath115 is needed to see an appreciable difference ( see the other curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : add_error ] ) , and it is reasonable to believe that the actual errors in the cross - power spectra will be suppressed by much more than a percent , resulting in the degradations as shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : add_error ] .",
    "while our model for the additive errors is admittedly crude , it is very difficult to parameterize these errors more accurately without end - to - end simulations that describe various systematic effects and estimate their contribution to the additive errors ( such simulations are now being planned or carried out by several research groups ) .",
    "moreover , additive errors can not be self - calibrated unless we can identify a functional dependence , which is distinct from the cosmological dependence of the power spectrum , that it must have .",
    "finally , we note that space - based surveys , such as snap , are expected to have a more accurate characterization of the additive error , primarily from the absence of atmospheric effects in the characterization of the psf .",
    "we now extend the calculations to the bispectrum of weak gravitational lensing .",
    "the bispectrum is the fourier counterpart of the three - point correlation function , and it describes the non - gaussianity of mass distribution in the large - scale structure that is induced by gravitational instability from the primordial gaussian perturbations that the simplest inflationary models predict . the redshift evolution and configuration dependence of the mass bispectrum can be accurately predicted using a suite of high - resolution @xmath185-body simulations ( see e.g.  bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "the bispectrum of lensing shear arises from the line - of - sight integration of products of the mass bispectrum and the lensing geometrical factor ( see eq .  ( 18 ) in takada & jain 2004 ) . following jain & seljak ( 1997 )",
    ", we roughly estimate how the lensing power spectrum and bispectrum scale with cosmological parameters by perturbing around the fiducial @xmath186cdm model :    @xmath187    where we have considered multipole mode of @xmath188 , equilateral triangle configurations in multipole space , redshift of all source galaxies @xmath189 ( no tomography ) , and constant equation of state parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we adopt the model described in takada & jain ( 2004 ) to compute the lensing bispectrum .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : expand ] ) illustrates that the power spectrum and the bispectrum depend upon specific combinations of cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , the power spectrum ( and more generally any two - point statistics of choice ) depends on @xmath30 and @xmath4 through the combination @xmath190 ( or equivalently @xmath191 ) .",
    "furthermore , the cosmological parameter dependences are strongly degenerate with source redshift ( @xmath192 ) unless accurate redshift information is available .",
    "importantly , the power spectrum and bispectrum have substantially _ different _ dependences on the parameters , suggesting that combining the two can be a powerful way of breaking the parameter degeneracies .",
    "for example , it is well known that a combination of @xmath193 , motivated from the hierarchical clustering ansatz , depends mainly on @xmath30 , with rather weak dependence on @xmath4 , so that roughly @xmath194 ( bernardeau et al .",
    "1997 , hui 1999 , takada & jain 2004 ) . as another example",
    ", the bispectrum amplitude increases with the mean source redshift @xmath192 more slowly than @xmath195 because the non - gaussianity of structure formation becomes suppressed at higher redshifts .",
    "it is therefore clear that photometric redshift errors of source galaxies will affect the power spectrum ( ps ) and bispectrum ( bs ) differently .",
    "likewise , it is natural to expect that other systematics that we have considered affect the power spectrum and the bispectrum in a different way .    for the ps+bs systematic analysis",
    ", we consider the redshift and multiplicative errors but not the additives .",
    "for the redshift errors we adopt the parameterization of redshift bin centroids , now applied to tomographic bins of both ps and bs .",
    "the multiplicative error is modeled similarly as in ",
    "[ sec : mult_define ] : the observed bispectrum with tomographic redshift bins @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath196 , @xmath197 , is related to the true bispectrum @xmath198 via @xmath199 .",
    "\\label{eq : define_mult_bs}\\ ] ] based on the considerations above , we study how combining the power spectrum with the bispectrum allows us to break parameter degeneracies not only in cosmological parameter space but also those induced by the presence of the nuisance systematic parameters .",
    "we include all triangle configurations , and compute the bispectra constructed using 5 redshift bins up to @xmath200 .",
    "note that , for a given triangle configuration , there are @xmath201 tomographic bispectra ; the large amount of time necessary to compute them is the reason why we use 5 tomographic bins instead of the original 7 - 10 . and [ fig : bispec_w ] do not exactly match those in figs .",
    "[ fig : z ] and [ fig : mult ] . ] note too that we have assumed that the ps and bs are uncorrelated and simply added their fisher matrices when combining them . while they are strictly uncorrelated in linear theory , nonlinear structure formation will introduce the correlation between the two , and the full information content will be smaller than our estimate .",
    "correlation between the ps and bs has not been accurately estimated to date , and such a project is well beyond the scope of our paper . however , our main emphasis here is not to accurately estimate the resulting cosmological error bars but rather to study the overall effect of the systematics when different weak lensing probes are combined .",
    "we expect the qualitative trends ( discussed below ) to be unchanged in cases when we add information from cross - correlation cosmography or cluster counts to the ps .",
    "figure [ fig : bispec_wa ] shows how the multiplicative errors ( left panel ) and redshift centroid errors ( right panel ) degrade constraints on @xmath133 and @xmath2 expected for snap .",
    "each panel shows the degradation in the parameter measurement due to the power spectrum , bispectrum , and the two combined .",
    "the most remarkable fact seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bispec_wa ] is that the _ degradation _ in the parameter accuracies is smaller with ps and bs combined as opposed to either one separately .",
    "this is because dependences of bs on cosmological parameters as well as the model systematics are complementary to those from ps .",
    "therefore , combining the ps and bs has a very beneficial effect of protecting against the systematics by more than a factor of two than either statistic alone !    however , the drastic improvement in self - calibration does not hold up for parameters that are more accurately measured , such as @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ fig : bispec_w ] shows the degradation in the @xmath34 case for the multiplicative errors ( left panel ) and redshift errors ( right panel ) .",
    "it is clear that the low self - calibration asymptote seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bispec_wa ] is no longer present , and even the cases when ps and bs are combined lead to appreciable degradations .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 does not benefit from self - calibration as much as @xmath133 and @xmath2 . more generally , self - calibration with ps+bs works much better when applied to poorly determined combinations of cosmological parameters than to the accurately determined ones ; we have explicitly checked this by diagonalizing the full fisher matrix and finding the degradations in all of its eigenvectors .",
    "in table [ tab : errors ] we now show the principal cosmological parameter with their fiducial values , and their errors for the ps only and ps+bs cases . in each case",
    "we show the error without any systematics , and the error after adding sample systematic errors . for the systematics ,",
    "we assume redshift biases ( described by chebyshev polynomials ) with priors of 0.0005 , _ together with _ the multiplicative errors of 0.005 .",
    "the errors have been marginalized over the other cosmological parameters , and the systematic - case errors have further been marginalized over the 30 redshift and 10 multiplicative nuisance parameters with the aforementioned priors . while the systematics used are a guess  and they are likely to remain uncertain well into the planning phase of each survey  our goal here is to see how the errors degrade . while the errors in the strongest fiducial surveys get degraded the most , we find that strongest surveys remain in that position even after adding the systematics .",
    "for example , lsst s fiducial error on @xmath5 was a factor of two better than snap s before adding the systematics , and is 50% better after adding them .",
    "note , however , that we have added _ equal _ systematic errors to all three surveys in this example ; in reality , a space - based survey like snap is expected to have a better control of the systematics than the ground based surveys ( see e.g.   rhodes et al .",

    "[ fig : cont ] we show the contours of constant degradation in equation of state of dark energy @xmath5 ( for the ps case only ) with both redshift and multiplicative errors included .",

    "<S> more powerful surveys have stronger systematic requirements . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for a snap - type survey the multiplicative error in shear needs to be smaller than @xmath0 of the mean shear in any given redshift bin , while the centroids of photometric redshift bins need to be known to better than @xmath1 . with about a factor of two degradation in cosmological parameter errors </S>",
    "<S> , future surveys can enter a self - calibration regime , where the mean systematic biases are self - consistently determined from the survey and only higher - order moments of the systematics contribute . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , once the power spectrum measurements are combined with the bispectrum , the self - calibration regime in the variation of the equation of state of dark energy @xmath2 is attained with only a 20 - 30% error degradation . </S>"
