    "it is almost universally accepted that the picture of the universe made up of approximately @xmath3 baryonic matter , @xmath4 dark matter and @xmath5 dark energy represents a realistic cosmological model .",
    "however , it is astounding that almost @xmath6 of the energy density of the universe resides in some as - yet - unknown form . what is `` dark matter '' ? what is `` dark energy '' ?    in refs .",
    "@xcite , a model of dark energy and dark matter was proposed in which a new unbroken gauge group @xmath0  the shadow sector  grows strong at a scale @xmath7ev .",
    "the gauge group @xmath0 was nicknamed quantum zophodynamics , or qzd , in refs .",

    "the present universe is assumed to be trapped in the false vacuum  @xcite , whose energy density mimics the cosmological constant .",
    "this is , in a nutshell , the dark energy model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also computed various quantities of interest such as the tunneling rate to the true vacuum , etc . a grand unified theory ( gut ) involving the sm and @xmath0",
    "was considered by ref .",
    "@xcite ( the models presented in refs .",
    "@xcite were later revisited by refs .",
    "@xcite . ) .",
    "the particle content of the model includes two shadow fermions , @xmath10 with @xmath11 , which transform as @xmath12 under @xmath13 , two messenger scalar fields ( mediating between the qzd and sm matters ; one of which is much heavier than the other @xcite ) @xmath14 with @xmath11 transforming as @xmath15 , and one singlet complex scalar field @xmath16 whose imaginary part plays the role of the axion - like particle mentioned above .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the masses of the @xmath0 triplet shadow fermions are found to be of the order of 100 - 200 gev for the @xmath0 gauge coupling to grow strong at a scale @xmath17 ev , needed for the dark energy scenario .",
    "this coupling constant starts out at gut - scale energy with a value comparable to that of the electroweak couplings , remains relatively flat until an energy comparable to the shadow fermion masses is reached , and then starts to grow after the shadow fermions drop out of the renormalization group ( rg ) equations . at that dropout point ,",
    "the @xmath0 gauge coupling becomes comparable to the weak @xmath18 coupling at the electroweak scale energy .",
    "these features have interesting consequences concerning the possibility of the shadow fermions being candidates for cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp s ) .",
    "the main reason is the fact that the annihilation cross sections for two shadow fermions into two @xmath0 `` shadow gluons '' are of the order of the weak cross sections , a typical requirement for wimp s .",
    "the estimates that were made in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that it was possible for shadow fermions to be candidates for cdm with the _ right _ relic density .    in this work",
    ", we would like to investigate this scenario in more details and by solving shadow fermions evolution equations to determine the conditions under which they can be considered to be wimp cold dark matter candidates .",
    "it will be seen that the mass range for the shadow fermions obtained by the requirement of having the _ right _ density fits in snugly with that used in the rg equations ( i.e. , the @xmath0 gauge coupling grows strong at a scale @xmath17 ev ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we go over the qzd model as far as the issue of dark matter is concerned .",
    "then , we derive the evolution equations for shadow fermions and consequently solve them numerically , to obtain their relic density .",
    "finally , the results of our relic density calculations will be presented and discussed , in comparison with the observational values .",
    "the shadow fermions relic density , when computed , would only depend on their masses .",
