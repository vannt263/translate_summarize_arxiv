    "the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic structures such as thin films , nanowires and nanoparticles have been studied extensively both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the interest in these particles is driven by fundamental features on the one hand and technological perspectives on the other  @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) , which has been applied with great success to thin ferromagnetic films in the past  @xcite , can be used to measure important material properties , such as the damping , gyromagnetic ratio and anisotropy constant .",
    "the temperature dependence of these properties for large or complex structures are often difficult to predict using analytical treatments , especially when temperature effects are included  @xcite . as well as being difficult to calculate analytically",
    ", temperature dependent calculations of ( for example ) fmr can be slow to converge .",
    "the convergence can become particularly troublesome if thermal fluctuations are accounted for .",
    "a specific motivation for this work is the interest in @xmath0 fept materials , which is a promising candidate for ultrahigh density magnetic recording  @xcite .",
    "the ability to tune magnetic properties , such as the damping is important for example , in devices based on spin transfer torque where a low damping of a free layer is essential for reducing the power consumption and can affect the signal to noise ratio  @xcite . in some cases such as in gmr read sensors , high damping is preferred to improve thermal stability  @xcite .    for technologies based on heat assisted magnetic recording ( hamr ) , understanding temperature effects and fluctuations in strongly anisotropic materials",
    ", will be crucially important . in this article we present analytical and numerical calculations of the material properties of strongly anisotropic materials at elevated temperatures",
    "we do so by utilizing the formalism of the landau - lifshitz - bloch ( llb ) equation of motion for ferromagnetic particles , which has an intrinsic temperature dependence via various input functions . in the first part of the paper we present the derivation of the temperature dependent analytic expression for the power absorbed by the particle .",
    "this analytic expression allows us to look at the effect of temperature on fmr curves for single domain particles .",
    "the temperature dependent input functions that enter into the llb formalism have been parameterised from atomistic spin dynamics with the exchange parameters calculated directly from _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite .",
    "we have tested the expressions with a single spin and multispin ( with exchange ) llb numerical model , by showing a number of resonance curves at different temperatures against the derived expressions ( without demagnetizing fields ) .",
    "the analytic expressions for the damping and resonance frequency show the overall trend of the temperature dependent behaviour .    in the second half of the paper",
    "we extend the scope of our analysis using a multi - macrospin model based on the llb formalism with large number of exchange coupled macrospins .",
    "we present numerical calculations of fmr in 2d and 3d structures with the inclusion of demagnetizing effects and ( stochastic ) thermal fluctuations .",
    "specifically , we have investigated the effects of the anisotropy constant and film thickness and anisotropy on the measured damping in out - of - plane films at high temperatures .",
    "our findings show that , depending on thickness or anisotropy , there is a competition between the demagnetizing and anisotropy energy that can modify the damping significantly . we have implemented this large scale model on the cuda gpu platform so that even with the inclusion of the stochastic thermal terms , it is possible to obtain good averaging of the fmr power spectra .",
    "there are limited experimental ferromagnetic studies of chemically ordered fept due to it s large magnetocrystalline anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to perform so - called optical fmr with the use of laser pulses  @xcite . in a theoretical work by butera  @xcite the resonance spectra",
    "were calculated using a computational model for disordered nanoparticles of fept .",
    "this study showed that the measured damping depended strongly on the amount of disorder . to our knowledge",
    "there are no systematic studies on the temperature dependence of the properties such as damping due to the limited fields in typical fmr setups , our results provide insight into this complex issue .",
    "the llb equation for magnetic macrospins describes the time evolution of an ensemble of atomic spins and allows for relaxation of the magnitude of the magnetization .",
    "the equation was originally derived by garanin  @xcite within a mean - field approximation from the classical fokker - planck equation for atomistic spins interacting with a heat bath .",
    "the resulting llb equation has been shown to be able to describe linear domain walls , a domain wall type with non - constant magnetisation length .",
    "these results are consistent with measurements of the domain wall mobility in yig crystals close to the curie point ( @xmath2 )  @xcite and with atomistic simulations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the predictions for the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times have been successfully compared with atomistic simulations  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we use this equation in the following for the thermodynamic simulations of macro - spins .",
    "the use of the llb formalism has the advantage over traditional micromagnetics that it automatically allows for changes in the modulus of the magnetisation . in theory",
    "it is indeed possible to calculate temperature dependent fmr using the atomistic spin dynamics ( asd ) model however , such an approach would be extremely computationally expensive .",
    "this computational expense in the asd model arises because , for fmr calculations , large system sizes are required to reduce the effects of thermal noise .",
    "whilst large systems are possible to calculate , the fmr calculations also require averaging over many cycles of the driving field , up to 100 s of nanoseconds .",
    "these two restrictions combined means that this method is not suitable , even with gpu acceleration or a ( for example mpi ) distributed memory solution  @xcite .",
    "a further challenge for accurate calculation of magnetic properties is the accounting of the long - ranged exchange in materials such as fept . through proper parameterisation of the llb equation",
    "@xcite one can account for such long ranged interactions in the _ so - called _ multiscale approach  @xcite . via this multiscale approach",
    "we can then bridge the gap between electronic structure calculations to large scale ( of the order of micrometres ) calculations of material properties . with this in mind",
    "the llb model is then ideally placed to describe temperature dependent ferromagnetic resonance .    the llb equation , without the stochastic term , can be written in the form : @xmath3+\\frac{\\gamma \\alpha _ { ||}}{m^{2}}\\left({\\mathbf}{m}\\cdot   { \\mathbf}{h}_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\right ) { \\mathbf}{m } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad { } -\\frac{\\gamma \\alpha _ { \\perp}}{m^{2 } } \\left[{\\mathbf}{m}\\times \\left \\lbrack { \\mathbf}{m}\\times { \\mathbf}{h}_{\\mathrm{eff } } \\right ] \\right ] .",
    "\\label{e : llb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] besides the usual precession and relaxation terms , the llb equation contains another term which controls longitudinal relaxation ( second term in equation  [ e : llb ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath4 is a spin polarisation which is not assumed to be of constant length and even its equilibrium value , @xmath5 , is temperature dependent .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is equal to the ratio of the magnetization of the macrospin normalised by the magnetization at saturation ( @xmath7 ) . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are dimensionless longitudinal and transverse damping parameters ( defined below ) and @xmath10 is the gyromagnetic ratio taken to be the free electron value .",
    "the transverse damping parameter in this equation is related to what is usually measured in experiments ( the gilbert damping , @xmath11 ) by the expression : @xmath12 the llb equation is valid for finite temperatures and even above @xmath2 , though the damping parameters and effective fields are different in the two regions . throughout this paper , we are only interested in the case @xmath13 with the damping parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the single particle free energy ( without demagnetizing fields ) is given by : @xmath16 and the effective fields , @xmath17 given by @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents an external magnetic field and @xmath20 an anisotropy field . here ,",
    "the susceptibilities @xmath21 are defined by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 . in these equations",
    ", @xmath25 is a microscopic parameter which characterizes the coupling of the individual , atomistic spins with the heat bath . for the purpose of testing the model",
    "we use a thermal bath coupling constant of @xmath25=0.05 , consistent with ref .  .",
    "there are differing values of the damping constant in the literature , for example , for granular fept becker _",
    "et al _ measured a damping constant of 0.1 using an optical fmr technique , whereas alvarez _",
    "et al _ found a value of 0.055 using standard fmr in a broad frequency range  @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out here that whilst @xmath25 is a coupling to the thermal bath equivalent to that used in atomistic spin dynamics and is assumed to be temperature independent .    at this point",
    "we should take some time to define the different constants related to the damping and their differences .",
    "the parameters , @xmath25 , @xmath9 , @xmath26 and @xmath11 correspond to the thermal bath coupling , the temperature dependent transverse and longitudinal damping parameters and the damping parameter that one would measure experimentally , respectively .",
    "the thermal bath coupling is temperature independent and is a phenomenological parameter that is the same as that used in atomistic spin dynamics .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal damping parameters that enter into the llb equation define the relaxation rates of the transverse and longitudinal magnetization components .",
    "finally , the parameters , @xmath11 , is equal to the perpendicular damping ( @xmath9 ) that enters into the equation of motion , divided by the magnetization and is what one would find in an fmr measurement from the linewidth .    for the application of this equation",
    "one has to know _ a - priori _ the spontaneous equilibrium magnetisation @xmath5 , the perpendicular ( @xmath27 ) and parallel ( @xmath28 ) susceptibilities . in this work",
    "these are calculated separately from a langevin dynamics simulation of an atomistic spin model , however it is possible to calculate these properties from mean field calculations  @xcite .",
    "we use a model for fept which was introduced earlier and which is meanwhile well - established in the literature @xcite .",
    "since this model was derived from first principles , a direct link is made from spin dependent density functional theory calculations , via a spin model , to our macrospin simulations .",

    "in the same study , the damping was measured at two temperatures ; 170  k and 290  k. between these two temperatures the damping was shown to be around 0.1 with a slight increase as one would expect .",

    "the resonance curves are shown on figure  [ fig : film ] for a range of temperatures for the 2d ( 2  nm thick ) film . from each fmr curve",

    "this ratio is consistent with the analytic solution for a single macrospin ( i.e. it is 1 ) , for high temperature however the damping is increased as the demagnetizing effects start to dominate over the anisotropy .",
    "next , we consider the effects of film thickness on the damping and resonance frequency .",
    "we increase the thickness of the film from 2  nm to 20  nm ( 1 cell to 10 cells ) and calculate the ferromagnetic resonance curve for each thickness ( a maximum of 400,000 cells for around 100  ns ) .",

    "the variation in the damping , with film thickness , close to the curie point will have a large effect on the magnetization dynamics in heat assisted magnetic recording ( for which fept is a promising candidate ) , that operates at elevated temperatures to allow for the reduction in the anisotropy at write head field of around 1 - 2  t. this reduction in damping for thick layers of fept would lead to longer switching times ( as we show below ) , limiting the write times .    in ref .",

    "analysis of the resulting fmr expressions for a single macrospin show that the analytically derived damping is consistent with those of extended thin films up to quite high temperatures . at temperatures close to @xmath70 ,",
    "the anisotropy decreases quickly and the demagnetizing effects play a more dominant role for the tin films .",
    "this means that our analytic expressions for thin films of magnetically soft materials would not hold , however , the analysis is still valid for single macrospins ( or small structures ) of soft materials .",
    "we have extended the calculations to include the thermal stochastic term and demagnetizing effects to explore the effect this plays on the temperature dependent ferromagnetic resonance curves . by calculating fmr spectra as a function of film thickness",
    ", we have shown that there is an increased damping for thinner films due to the interplay between the demagnetizing fields and the anisotropy .",
    "for the thinner films there is more of a tendency for the films to want to lie in - plane due to the demagnetizing field . for highly anisotropic materials ( shown here for fept )",
    "this effect is more dominant at elevated temperatures .",
    "we have verified that this increase in damping can be explained by change in the dominance of the demagnetizing energy by varying the anisotropy constant for the thin films . as the anisotropy constant",

    "writing the effective field as , @xmath100 , with @xmath101 and @xmath102 we arrive at an inhomogeneous differential equation : @xmath103 in the first step , we solve the homogeneous part of the differential equation [ e : dglm1 ] , using the ansatz @xmath104 whose solution leads to the expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath105 @xmath106 in the next step , we solve the inhomogeneous differential equation [ e : dglm1 ] under the assumption that the applied magnetic field @xmath107 has the form @xmath108 , where @xmath109 . these lead to the following simplification of the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ e : dglm1 ] , @xmath110 using the ansatz @xmath111 where @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 and assuming @xmath114 and @xmath115 eq .",

    "this leads to the analytic solution for the power spectrum @xmath30 : @xmath118    as we can see from equation  [ e : llbp_redapp ] , the analytic solution for the absorbed power depends on the magnetization , which in - turn depends on the longitudinal susceptibility .",
    "as mentioned above , we approximate the magnetization in the presence of an applied field ( equation  [ e : approxm ] ) in terms of the zero field susceptibility .",
    "therefore , equation  [ e : approxm ] is only strictly correct in the zero field limit .",
    "away from the critical temperature the zero field susceptibility is small , therefore in this limit the approximation holds . as we approach the critical temperature the susceptibility diverges as we approach the phase transition .",
    "this means that our analytic expression shows a deviation from the numerically calculated result .",
    "a plot of the magnetization as a function of temperature using equation  [ e : approxm ] and data from numerical simulations can be seen in figure  [ f : m_t ] . for small values of the applied field",
    "this error reduces as the susceptibility is defined for small changes in the applied field .    ,",
    "gained from atomistic fept simulations , a fit to which defines the input function , @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "the dashed ( blue ) and dotted ( black ) lines represent expression  [ e : approxm ] for different applied fields .",
    "the symbols represents the equilibrium magnetization in the presence of an applied field , @xmath120 t , from the numerical simulations of a single macrospin without demagnetizing , stochastic or exchange fields . ]",
    "figure  [ f : m_t ] shows the equilibrium magnetization ( red solid curve ) , initially calculated from atomistic spin dynamics simulations  @xcite , which is used as an input to the numeric simulation . as well as the equilibrium magnetization , the figure also shows the magnetization as a function of temperature in 5 and 10 t applied fields , which is of course not zero at the ( zero field ) curie temperature .",
    "the dashed and dotted line is the analytic solution to the magnetization ( also in 5 and 10 t fields ) , diverging across the curie temperature .",
    "as we can see , the magnetization in an applied field from the analytic expression shows a diverging behaviour as we approach the curie temperature because of the diverging susceptibility , whereas the numerical simulations ( points ) show no such divergence .",
    "for efficient calculation of the magnetostatic fields we write the convolution  [ eq : rsc ] as : @xmath121 where the greek symbols @xmath64 , @xmath65 again denote cartesian components @xmath33,@xmath83,@xmath34 and latin symbols @xmath58 , @xmath80 denote the lattice sites .",
    "@xmath122 are interaction matrices which only depend on the structure of the material ( cubic in this work ) .",
    "since we are considering a translationally invariant lattice one can apply the discrete convolution theorem and calculate the fields in fourier space : @xmath123 it should be pointed out here that we have absorbed the prefactor , @xmath124 into the interaction matrix , @xmath122 . furthermore to write the fields in terms of units of tesla to be consistent with the form of the fields above , we have multiplied equation  [ eq : rsc ] by @xmath125 .",
    "the fourier transform of the interaction matrix only has to be performed once and thus stored in memory .",
    "there are a number of conditions that must be met in order to utilize the convolution theorem . in terms of signal processing theory",
    "the interaction matrix is seen as the response function and the magnetization data is the signal .",
    "we should not that there are two conditions that must be satisfied to utilize the convolution theorem .",
    "the first is that the signal ( spin system ) must be periodic in space .",
    "the second is that the range of the response function should be the same as the signal  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic system is usually not periodic and the demagnetizing effects are long ranging and can not be cut - off at a reasonable distance due to the slow decay  @xcite . to solve this",
    "we simulate a finite system , therefore to meet the above requirements it is required that we zero pad the magnetization configurations by doubling the size of each dimension and adding zero s in the areas where there are no macrospins .    at each update of the demagnetizing field ( every 10fs ) the fourier transform of the magnetization arrays",
    "is performed and the resulting fourier components convoluted with that of the interaction matrix .",
    "the resulting product is back transformed via an inverse fourier transform to give the demagnetizing fields in real space .",
