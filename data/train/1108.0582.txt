    "the well - established theory of cosmic ray ( cr ) acceleration by strong non - relativistic shocks predicts a differential energy power law spectrum @xmath0 with a spectral index @xmath1 ( axford , leer & skadron 1977 , krimskii 1977 , bell 1978 , blandford & ostriker 1978 ) .",
    "however , a variety of spectral indices is observed .",
    "galactic cr have a steeper spectrum even when allowance is made for energy - dependent propagation losses ( hillas 2005 ) .",
    "steeper spectra are also observed in young supernova remnants ( snr ) as discussed below .",
    "deviations from a @xmath1 spectrum are well known for relativistic shocks ( for example : kirk & heavens 1989 , ostrowski 1991 , baring ellison & jones 1993 , ruffalo 1999 , gieseler et al 1999 , kobayakawa , honda & samura 2002 , achterberg et al 2001 ) . here we show that corrections to theory produce a spectral index that deviates significantly from @xmath1 even at shock velocities as low as 10,000 km s@xmath2 typical of young supernova remnants .",
    "the magnitude of the effect depends on the ratio of the velocity of the accelerating particle to the shock velocity .",
    "hence , it may also apply to the acceleration of non - relativistic particles at heliospheric shocks .",
    "the spectrum can either steepen or flatten depending on the angle between the shock normal and the large scale upstream magnetic field .",
    "quasi - perpendicular shocks ( jokipii 1982 , 1987 ) show particularly strong steepening .",
    "the effect is small for parallel shocks where changes in the spectral index are second order in the ratio of the particle velocity to the shock velocity .",
    "non - linear hydrodynamic feedback of the cr pressure onto the shock structure can also change the spectral index ( drury 1983 , dury & vlk 1981 , ellison , baring & jones 1996 ) but we do not take account of this in the present paper .",
    "we assume that the fluid velocity is uniform both upstream and downstream of the shock .",
    "a further assumption lying at the heart of our method is that the magnetic field can be divided into ( i ) a large scale field that is uniform apart from a change of direction and magnitude at the shock and ( ii ) a small scale field that fluctuates on scales smaller than the cr larmor radius and deflects the cr trajectories through small angles to cumulatively scatter the cr .",
    "this ignores magnetic field line wandering which can also change the cr spectral index ( kirk , duffy & gallant 1996 ) . in our calculations",
    "we further assume that the fluid is always compressed by a factor of four at the shock , which neglects the increase in compression at the shock due to the different equation of state of the relativistic component ( ratio of specific heats = 4/3 ) and the effects of finite mach number . with these assumptions we isolate and concentrate on the breakdown of the diffusive approximation and the effect of high order anisotropies in the cr distribution near the shock .",
    "cosmic rays are thought to be accelerated to high energy by crossing back and forth across a shock in a first order fermi process , with a fractional energy gain of order @xmath3 at each crossing where @xmath4 is the shock velocity .",
    "a small proportion of the cr injected at low energy proceed to cross the shock many times before escaping the shock environment .",
    "statistically this results in a power law stretching up to a few pev in the galaxy and probably approaching zev extragalactically .",
    "here we consider cr protons of mass @xmath5 , but the analysis applies equally well to heavier ions or to electrons .",

    "as expected , the comparison shows a difference in the spectral index due to the neglect of second order terms in @xmath44 , but the two curves are sufficiently close to give confidence that the results from code a can be relied upon .",

    "the oblique shock ( @xmath177 ) exhibits a peak in the cr density at the shock as previously identified in mildly relativistic shocks .",
    "geissler et al ( 1999 ) convincingly argued for a build - up of cr immediately upstream of the shock because cr approaching the shock from upstream with certain pitch angles are unable to cross the shock into the downstream region .",

    "figure 3 is a plot of cr density profiles at higher resolution . at @xmath181 an excess of cr",
    "is seen within one cr larmor radius both upstream and downstream of the shock . according to equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) , as discussed above , the excess cr density at the shock results in enhanced cr acceleration .",
    "the excess increases the rate at which cr cross the shock , and hence increases the probability of acceleration to high energy before being advected away downstream of the shock .",
    "this explains the flattening of the cr spectrum at quasi - parallel shocks as seen in figure 1 .",
    "2 cm    the cr density profile at a perpendicular shock is different as seen in figure 2(c ) and in figure 3 .",
    "diffusion theory can still be applied to cr at a perpendicular shock by deconstructing the cr trajectory into diffusive motion of the gyrocentre and gyration about the gyrocentre .",
    "the gyratory part of the trajectory acts as a spatial convolution on the motion of the gyrocentre .",

    "a discontinuous jump in cr density is not possible at the shock on a scale less than a larmor radius .",
    "correspondingly , figures 2(c ) and 3 exhibit a cr density gradient both downstream and upstream of a perpendicular shock .",
    "consequently , the cr density precisely at the shock is smaller than the cr density far downstream . in this case , the rate at which cr cross the shock is reduced and the spectrum at quasi - perpendicular shocks is steeper than @xmath91 in line with equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) . according to equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) of jokipii ( 1987 ) the diffusive approximation is only valid at a quasi - perpendicular shock when @xmath182 .",
    "this is consistent with the results shown in our figure 1 where we see that deviations from a @xmath91 spectrum occur where this condition is not met .",
    "the profile for @xmath183 is intermediate between the quasi - perpendicular and the quasi - parallel cases .",
    "the steepening and flattening effects are both present but cancel out to leave a cr density approximately equal to that far downstream and a cr spectrum proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "_ ( i ) galactic cosmic rays _    cr arriving at the earth with energies up to a few pev conform to a remarkably straight power law spectrum @xmath184 with @xmath97 equal to 4.6 - 4.7 .",
    "the more rapid escape from the galaxy of high energy cr steepens the spectrum , but this can not be solely responsible for steepening the spectrum from an index at source of @xmath185 .",
    "the underlying cr source spectrum probably has an index between about 4.2 and 4.3 ( gaisser , protheroe & stanev 1998 , hillas 2005 ) .",
    "figure 1 indicates that the oblique - shock effects discussed here can produce a steepened spectrum ( @xmath186 ) at high shock velocities , but only if the shock has a tendency towards a quasi - perpendicular rather than quasi - parallel configuration .",
    "as discussed in section 4 , the spectral index averaged over random magnetic field orientations is approximately the same as for the low velocity limit : @xmath158 .",
    "the shock might be preferentially quasi - perpendicular in the event of strong magnetic field amplification in the precursor due to cr streaming ( bell 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "field amplification is driven by @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the electric current carried by streaming cr and @xmath115 is the local magnetic field . the plasma is set in motion perpendicular to @xmath189 and therefore predominantly perpendicular to the shock normal since @xmath189 is directed away from the shock .",
    "these upstream fluid motions stretch the magnetic field perpendicular to the shock normal producing a quasi - perpendicular shock orientation as evident in the sample field lines shown in figure 4 of bell ( 2005 ) .",
    "hence strong field amplification can be expected to lead preferentially to a quasi - perpendicular shock geometry and the steepening of the spectral index .",
    "this is not contradicted by polarimetric observations which suggest a predominantly radial magnetic field in snr .",
    "zirakashvili & ptuskin ( 2008 ) point out that this field orientation probably develops downstream of the shock due to differential fluid motions after the plasma has passed through the shock .",
    "a similar effect is seen in simulations by giacalone & jokipii ( 2007 ) .",
    "alternatively , the shock might be preferentially quasi - perpendicular if the supernova expands into a pre - existing circumstellar wind supporting a magnetic field in the form of a parker spiral .",
    "this would be unsurprising since sn are often preceded by strong mass loss .",
    "another possible source of spectral steepening is non - linear feedback onto the shock hydrodynamics ( drury & vlk 1981 , drury 1983 ) .",
    "non - linear effects produce a concave spectrum which is steepened at low energy but flatter than @xmath91 at high energy ( bell 1987 , falle & giddings 1987 ) .",
    "allen et al ( 2008 ) find evidence for concavity in the synchrotron spectrum of sn1006 .",
    "the galactic cr spectrum is not noticeably concave , but a compensating convexity due to momentum - dependent escape from the galaxy could produce the measured spectrum",
    ". the cr spectrum could be the result of a complicated mixture of non - linear , oblique - shock and escape effects .",
    "( ii ) young supernova remnants _    further evidence for deviation from a @xmath91 cr source spectrum can be found in synchrotron spectra .",
    "snr radio spectral indices can deviate considerably from @xmath159 ( @xmath158 ) . since synchrotron loss times at radio wavelengths are longer than the dynamical time , the measured spectral index gives a proper indication of the cosmic ray source spectrum .",
    "observations show that young pre - sedov snr consistently exhibit radio spectral indices significantly steeper than @xmath190 .",
    "either magnetic field amplification or expansion into a parker spiral may produce a geometry favouring quasi - perpendicular shocks and spectral steepening .",
    "but in either case , a high shock velocity is needed .",
    "if this is the explanation of the steeper than expected galactic cr spectrum , then it implies that galactic cr are accelerated by young snr rather than by snr in the sedov phase .    in figure 4 we plot a sample of snr ( see table  [ table : spectralindex ] ) and their spectral indices as a function of shock velocity .",
    "it is related to the analysis of glushak ( 1985 ) who plotted the spectral indices of young shell snr against snr age to show that the spectra flattened with time . here",
    "we plot the spectral index against the _ mean _ expansion velocity @xmath191 calculated as the mean radius divided by snr age , and extend and update the sample of snr .",
    "we take the mean rather than the momentary expansion velocity since the overall spectrum is an addition of cosmic rays that were accelerated throughout the entire age of the remnant . depending on the number of cosmic rays that enroll in the acceleration process early versus late , additional differences in the spectral index",
    "can result .",
    "the average time since acceleration would be different for core - collapse snr and type ia sne . in type ia sne most cr",
    "are accelerated at late times as the shock expands into a uniform medium , whereas cr acceleration is more evenly spread in the case of core - collapse snr which expand into a @xmath192 density profile of a circumstellar wind ( schure et al 2010 ) .",
    "the galactic remnants in figure 4 were taken from the updated online catalogue by green ( 2009 ) .",
    "they were selected if they were classified as having a clear shell morphology ( i.e. no contamination in radio from a central source ) , had a measured spectral index and a readily available distance estimate .",
    "only sources were selected that are estimated to be younger than 10,000  yr , and not clearly interacting or overlapping with other radio sources .    because of a lack of data for galactic snr with ages less than 200 years , we turn to the extragalactic remnants of recent sn for data on very young snr .",
    "we added data for sn1987a ( manchester et al 2002 , manchester et al 2005 ) and sn1993j ( weiler et al 2007 ) , and a sample of type ib / c supernovae taken from chevalier & fransson ( 2006 ) .",
    "two data points are plotted for sn1987a corresponding to observations in 2002 and 2005 since its expansion velocity slowed significantly between these years .    for our purpose ,",
    "very young snr from type ib / c sne are especially interesting because of their high expansion velocities .",
    "they do not necessarily reflect a statistical sample .",
    "their expansion velocities are based on models of the radius of the remnant at the time of the peak in synchrotron self absorption , as described in ( chevalier 1998 ) . each of the type ib / c s has a steep spectral index except for sn1998bw which was the only one to be associated with a grb .",
    "chevalier & fransson ( 2006 ) argue that the flattening with time may be a result of the nonlinear feedback of the cosmic rays in the plasma , which weakens with time .",
    "nonlinear models by ellison & reynolds ( 1991 ) can partly account for the steepening , up to @xmath193 , if the cosmic ray pressure constitutes a dominant fraction .",
    "the total steepening may be a cumulative effect of non - linear and oblique - shock steepening .    except in the cases of the historical supernova remnants ,",
    "the age of the galactic remnants is a highly uncertain parameter .",
    "often it is based on the distance measurement , giving the size of the remnant , and from the temperature in x - rays a shock velocity is derived .",
    "subsequently a sedov model is used to arrive at the age estimate .",
    "however , in addition to uncertainties in the size , if any energy is lost in e.g.  cosmic rays the shock velocity may be severely underestimated , as was shown might be the case in rcw 86 ( helder et al 2009 ) .",
    "the data points in figure 4 should therefore be considered with large error bars in @xmath191 and are likely to underestimate the shock velocity on average .",
    "the ones for which this is known are indicated with an arrow , however this does not mean that other data points are necessarily more certain . occasionally the shock velocity can possibly be overestimated when the age measurement is based on the age of the associated pulsar ( i.e.  g292.2 - 0.5 ) .",
    "the age of the historical remnants is obviously more certain .",
    "however , their distance estimate may still introduce a large uncertainty in the size and shock velocity .",
    "nevertheless , the data show a clear trend . as a guide ,",
    "we plot on figure 4 a trend - line : @xmath194 where @xmath191 is the radius divided by age for snr . although the data are uncertain at high velocity , the rise in the spectral index levels off at about @xmath195 .",
    "a levelling off also occurs at @xmath196 for older snr with lower expansion velocities .",
    "a better fit to the overall data may be an s - shaped curve with a stronger increase of spectral index at velocities around @xmath197 km s@xmath2 .",
    "an appropriate trend - line for the historical snr , for which the velocity estimates are more reliable , is @xmath198 as plotted in figure 4 .",
    "the two data points for sn1987a show that the variation of spectral index with shock velocity is exhibited within the lifetime of a single snr .",
    "the radio spectrum of cassiopeia a has similarly been observed to flatten with time as already argued in the seventies ( baars et al 1977 ) .",
    "a flattening of the cas a radio spectrum from @xmath199 to @xmath200 was found over a period of 15 years ( 19651980 ) .",
    "further flattening was confirmed by osullivan & green ( 1990 ) , although they found it proceeding at a slower rate .    0.3 cm _ ( iii ) spectral index variations within snr _",
    "further signatures of spectral index variation with shock obliquity may be visible in snr expanding at high velocity into a uniform magnetic field .",
    "if magnetic field amplification is weak , the field orientation at the shock is that of the pre - existing interstellar field .",
    "the electron spectrum should be flatter where the shock is quasi - parallel , increasing the number of cr electrons accelerated to high energy , and producing stronger x - ray synchrotron emission at the poles .",
    "detailed , resolved , spectra are available for the remnant of sn1006 .",
    "this image shows a distinct bipolar symmetry , which is thought to reflect the directionality of the ambient magnetic field .",
    "most likely the bright caps are the parts where the shock velocity is parallelly aligned with the background magnetic field ( rothenflug et al 2004 , bocchino et al 2011 ) . in an analysis of the combined radio- with the x - ray spectrum allen et al ( 2008 ) found evidence for hardening of the spectrum in this area , both for models which included curvature in the spectrum and those without .",
    "the fractional hardening is modest but significant . the magnetic field in sn 1006",
    "is generally believed to be not much amplified and therefore plausibly reflects the original field geometry .",
    "the spectral steepening towards the fainter parts , i.e.  higher obliquity angle between the shock normal and magnetic field lines , is consistent with our findings .",
    "detailed data are also available for tycho s snr , as was presented in katz - stone ( 2000 ) .",
    "this remnant shows a much more patchy profile in radio .",
    "spectra were extracted from various parts over the remnant .",
    "no clear trend with position was found .",
    "however , it was argued that the brightest parts have a flatter spectral index than the steeper parts , which is a similar trend to that in sn1006 .    a spatially resolved study of the radio spectrum of cassiopeia a ( wright et al 1999 ) shows variation of the spectral index with position in the remnant .",
    "generally , a steeper power law is found in the outermost regions , whereas in the inner bright ring the spectral index is flatter ( although still @xmath201 ) .",
    "the spectra they found do not show signs of spectral curvature and seem to be coherent over larger scales than the diffusion scale .",
    "this indicates a common mechanism , such as e.g.  a preferentially perpendicular field at the forward shock might be able to account for . the magnetic field in cas a is strongly amplified and thus a preferentially perpendicular field may be expected",
    ".    0.3 cm _ ( iv ) older supernova remnants _",
    "the radio spectral indices of old snr in the self - similar sedov phase are usually around 0.5 , but many have flatter spectra which may be due to additional second order fermi acceleration in mhd turbulence ( ostrowski 1999 ) , or possibly due to compression ratios greater than four at radiative shocks . because the shock velocities are much lower than in young snr , the oblique - shock effects considered in this paper are unlikely to contribute to the flattening of the spectral index .",
    "we have shown that a wide range of spectral indices are possible for shock velocities of around @xmath202 or higher .",
    "the cr spectrum is steepened for quasi - perpendicular shocks and flattened for shocks closer to parallel geometry .",
    "this may present a natural explanation of why few observed energetic particle spectra conform to the non - relativistic test - particle @xmath158 spectrum , although non - linear effects and second order fermi acceleration probably also play a role . for a shock propagating into a randomly orientated upstream magnetic field the steepening and flattening of the spectrum averages out to produce @xmath203 .",
    "observed radio spectra show that the spectrum is steeper at high shock velocity which suggests that high velocity shocks tend to be quasi - perpendicular rather than parallel . a predominantly quasi - perpendicular configuration may arise if magnetic field amplification is strong as expected at high shock velocity .",
    "alternatively , a quasi - perpendicular geometry may result from expansion into a circumstellar wind supporting a parker spiral .",
    "the galactic cr energy spectrum and the radio spectra of young snr require a cr spectrum at source which is steeper than @xmath91 . the galactic cr spectral index may be explained if cr are accelerated by shocks such as those found in the historical snr .",
    "these snr have a relatively large shock area , still expand at a relatively high velocity into a possibly dense circumstellar medium , and produce cr with a suitable spectral index if the snr shock is predominantly quasi - perpendicular .",
    "the spectral index is sensitive to the cr scattering rate @xmath113 which is presently not well determined by observation or theory .",
    "observations ( figure 4 ) suggest a fairly clear relation between snr shock velocity and spectral index .",
    "our model depends on the presumed simplification that the magnetic field structure can be separated into a small scale disordered component that scatters cr through small angles , and a large scale component which is uniform over a cr larmor radius",
    ". however , the essential reason for spectral steepening by quasi - perpendicular shocks is that the magnetic field sweeps cr through the shock making it difficult for cr to return to the shock for further acceleration .",
    "this effect can be expected to be independent of the detailed field structure .",
    "another realisation of a related effect would be spectral steepening due to field line wandering ( kirk , duffy & gallant 1996 ) .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the european research council under the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007- 2013 ) / erc grant agreement no .",
