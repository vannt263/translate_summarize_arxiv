    "although thermoelectric materials have received enduring attention over the past half century for their ability to convert thermal energy to electrical energy and vice versa , the growing need to develop new materials with enhanced properties for applications has led to a renewed interest in recent years .  @xcite the potential performance of a given thermoelectric material is expressed in terms of the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath11 , where @xmath5 is the thermoelectric power , @xmath12 is the electrical resistivity , and @xmath4 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "high thermoelectric power must be combined with low thermal conductivity and low electrical resistivity to optimize the figure of merit .",
    "large values of @xmath13 have been observed in the filled skutterudites @xmath14sb@xmath15 ( @xmath16 = rare earths or alkaline earth metals , @xmath17 = transition metals ) , which combine large values of the thermopower @xmath5 , which can be as large as 10 - 100 @xmath18v / k , with low thermal conductivity @xmath4 , as small as a few w / k - m .",
    "@xcite the low @xmath4 of these systems reflects an unusually small phonon contribution , originating with enhanced scattering of heat - carrying phonons from the low energy rattling and tunneling modes of filler `` @xmath16 '' atoms in the @xmath19sb@xmath15 cage - like structures characteristic for these compounds .",
    "@xcite consequently , it is potentially of great interest to identify and explore other classes of correlated materials that similarly form in open and cage - like structures .    recently ,",

    "the combination of confined ca atoms and the open structure of the feas framework in cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 is reminiscent of the cages in the filled skutterudites @xmath22fe@xmath0as@xmath15 ( @xmath22= ce and pr ) .",
    "@xcite , and it is possible that here too a low thermal conductivity might be realized .",
    "we note as well that large thermopowers are generally found in metals where strong correlations lead to enhanced densities of states near the fermi level .",
    "cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at @xmath23 k , which has been classified as an incommensurate spin density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "@xcite the sdw becomes commensurate with the underlying lattice below a second transition that occurs at @xmath6 k. however , the sdw does not appear to gap the entire fermi surface , since metallic fermi liquid behavior is found at the lowest temperatures , where the electrical resistivity @xmath24 and the electronic specific heat @xmath25 .",

    "the possibility of a small thermal conductivity , derived from the confinement of the ca atoms and the possibility of strong enhancement of the density of states at low temperatures , suggested by the large kadowaki - woods ratio , make cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 a promising candidate for a large thermoelectric figure of merit .",
    "accordingly , we present here measurements of the thermal and electrical transport properties of single crystals of cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 , which together with ab initio calculations of the electronic structure , probe not only the character of the quasiparticles forming the ground state , but also the impact of the sdw transitions on the electronic structure .",

    "@xcite if the low thermal conductivity observed in cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 arises from the rattling of ca atoms in the open tunnel - like structure , then the phonon mean free path should be comparable to either the 6   cage dimension , or to the 3.7   nearest ca - ca separation distance .",
    "we have estimated the phonon mean free path @xmath53 using the expression @xmath54 , where @xmath55 at 300 k is 189 j / mol k , a debye temperature @xmath56 is taken from the adp of cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 as 328 k , and the averaged sound velocity @xmath57 is estimated from the debye model to be 2784 m / s .",

    "further evidence for the strong phonon scattering comes from the temperature dependence of @xmath4 , which displays a broad shoulder centered around 30 k in cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 .",
    "ordinarily , a broad maximum in @xmath43 is expected at @xmath59 , resulting from the crossover between phonon - boundary and/or phonon - point defect scattering at low temperatures ( @xmath60 ) and phonon - phonon umklapp scattering at high temperatures ( @xmath61 ) . in principle , the absence of a maximum in @xmath32 in cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 might be ascribed to particularly strong phonon scattering from point - like defects . however , the broad maximum is found even in polycrystalline filled skutterudites , where defects are expected to be plentiful .",
    "@xcite a shoulder in @xmath32 is found only in skutterudites with small filler atoms ,  @xcite whose large amplitude rattling leads to particularly strong phonon scattering .",
    "the shoulder observed in @xmath32 in cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 implies that the phonon scattering is very strong here as well .",
    "the temperature dependencies of the thermal conductivities @xmath4 and the electrical resistivity @xmath12 reveal the presence of a sdw transition into an antiferromagnetically ordered state below the nel temperature @xmath2=88 k. recent neutron diffraction measurements confirm that the 88 k transition in cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 is indeed to an incommensurate sdw state .",
    "@xcite figure  [ fig1](a ) shows that @xmath37 decreases approximately linearly as the temperature is reduced , and like @xmath34 , displays a weak anomaly at @xmath2 .",
    "measurements carried out on charge - density wave ( cdw ) systems k@xmath62moo@xmath1 and ( tase@xmath0)@xmath63i ,  @xcite find only a small cusp in @xmath43 but not in @xmath37 with the onset of the lattice distortion associated with the cdw , just as we observe at the sdw transition in cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 .",
    "the softening of the phonons that drive cdws , and to a lesser extent sdws , is thought to be responsible for the reduced values of @xmath43 found in the ordered state @xmath64 ( fig .  [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "@xcite given the complexity of the fermi surface of cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 ,  @xcite we can expect that sdw formation will lead only to a partial gapping of the fermi surface , resulting in a decreased density of states and a higher electrical resistivity in the ordered phase .",
    "this explains the initial increase in @xmath34 below @xmath2 in cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 , which is much as is found in cr near its 311 k transition to an incommensurate sdw state .",
    "@xcite however , the remaining states at the fermi surface ultimately lead to the resumption of a metallic temperature dependence of the resistivity below @xmath3 ( fig .",

    "provided that the strength of the electronic correlations is not reduced , we believe that electron doping should lead to a considerable enhancement of the thermopower . for instance , the dft density of states suggest that the thermopower in the paramagnetic state changes sign and increases by about an order of magnitude at the following doping levels : 9 - 14 @xmath45 on the fe site , 12 - 19 @xmath45 on the as site , and 35 - 50 @xmath45 on the ca site . however , if many - body renormalizations are included , the required doping levels can be expected to be substantially reduced from the levels predicted by dft .",
    "similarly , we speculate that superconductivity might be induced in @xmath10 by improving its metallic character , perhaps by a dopant that reduces the lattice constant .",
    "further experimental and theoretical work is needed to establish whether a localized or itinerant picture is more appropriate for @xmath10 .",

    "<S> we present here measurements of the thermopower , thermal conductivity , and electrical resistivity of the newly reported compound cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> evidence is presented from specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements that a substantial fraction of the fermi surface survives the onset of spin density wave ( sdw ) order at the nel temperature @xmath2=88 k , and its subsequent commensurate lockin transition at @xmath3=26.4 k. the specific heat below @xmath3 consists of a normal metallic component from the ungapped parts of the fermi surface , and a bardeen - cooper- schrieffer ( bcs ) component that represents the sdw gapping of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> a large kadowaki - woods ratio is found at low temperatures , showing that the ground state of cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 is a strongly interacting fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity @xmath4 of cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 is an order of magnitude smaller than those of conventional metals at all temperatures , due to a strong phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the thermoelectric power @xmath5 displays a sign change from positive to negative indicating that a partial gap forms at the fermi level with the onset of commensurate spin density wave order at @xmath6 k. the small value of the thermopower @xmath5 and the enhancements of the resistivity due to gap formation and strong quasiparticle interactions offset the low value of the thermal conductivity @xmath4 , yielding only a modest value for the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath7 in cafe@xmath0as@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of ab initio electronic structure calculations are reported , confirming that the sign change in the thermopower at @xmath3 is reflected by a sign change in the slope of the density of states at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> values for the quasiparticle renormalization @xmath8 are derived from measurements of the specific heat and thermopower , indicating that as @xmath9 , @xmath10 is among the most strongly correlated of the known fe - based pnictide and chalcogenide systems . </S>"
