    "the magneto  optical kerr effect(moke ) consists in the rotation of the polarization plane of light reflected from the surface of a magnetic material .",
    "it was discovered in 1877 by john kerr  @xcite while he was examining the light reflected from a polished electromagnet pole .",
    "very recently it became the object of an intense experimental investigations , mainly for two reasons .",
    "first one can exploit this effect to read suitably magnetically stored information using optical means in modern high density data storage technology  @xcite .",
    "second , the moke can be used as a powerful probe in many fields of research such as microscopy for domain observation , surface magnetism , magnetic interlayer coupling in multilayers  @xcite .",
    "it can also be used to observe plasma resonance effects in thin layers , and structural and magnetic anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic origin of the kerr effect is a combined action of the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and the net spin ",
    "polarization of the material  @xcite .",
    "indeed the existence of a non zero magnetization in the ground state is due to a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the system .",
    "this symmetry breaking is transferred , through the soc , to the spatial part of the wave ",
    "functions so that @xmath0 is different from @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly the absorption is different for light with right and left circular polarization .",
    "the problem has been addressed in the literature and _ ab  initio _ calculations , based on density functional theory ( dft ) , are available for transition metals like @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite and , recently , for other materials such as full - heusler films and @xmath5doped @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the kerr parameters are commonly obtained from the kubo formula  @xcite for the optical conductivity tensor using the single particle kohn  sham ( ks ) wavefunctions .",
    "this is equivalent to the computation of the dielectric constant at the random phase approximation ( rpa ) without the inclusion of local fields ( lf ) and exchange  correlation ( @xmath7 ) corrections .",
    "we will refer to this approach as independent particles rpa ( ip  rpa ) scheme .",
    "also an alternative approach , based on the luttinger s",
    "formula  @xcite , has been proposed in the literature  @xcite , starting from the current  current correlation function , @xmath8 .",
    "also in this case the ks wave  functions are used and lf and xc  effects are not considered .    in",
    "all these works the kerr paramenters are computed within the dft framework strarting from the dielectric tensor , @xmath9 , or , which is the same , from the conductivity , @xmath10 .",
    "however while the diagonal terms of the dielectric tensor , i.e. @xmath11 , can be expressed in terms of the density  density correlation function , @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 if lf and xc effects are included ) , at the best of our knowledge , no such expression has been derived for the off  diagonal terms , i.e. @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the latter can be obtained only starting from @xmath16 which however is not expressed as a functional of the density . in this case",
    "the sole formal justification to the use of ks quantities to construct @xmath16 is that `` a posteriori '' the approach give good results and that ks wave  functions can be regarded as a good approximation to quasi",
    " particle wave  functions .    in the present work instead",
    "we derive an expression for the full dielectric tensor in terms of @xmath12 and so for the construction of the kerr parameters within a density based approach . besides a formal justification to the use of the dft approach",
    ", the result we propose can be regarded as a starting point to go beyond the rpa ",
    "ip scheme to include lf and xc  effects .",
    "indeed while the description of transition metals within the rpa ",
    "ip approach is reasonable , for semiconductors important deviations are expected , in particular when excitons ( magnetic excitons ) exist .",
    "magnetic semiconductors are in fact materials of great interest , especially in view of spin electronics ( spintronics ) applications and the moke can be a valuable tool for the investigation of their properties  @xcite .    in the present work we limit our discussion to the polar geometry , that is when the propagation direction of the photon ( the @xmath17 axis ) and the magnetization of the system are both perpendicular to the surface of the sample ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "experimentally this is the most studied geometry , and it is also the one which in general gives the largest moke signal . to support our theoretical derivation with numerical results",
    "we have implemented in the plane  waves and pseudo  potentials based code @xmath19  @xcite the computation of the kerr parameters .",

    "this term describes the anomalous hall conductivity . taking iron as reference system",
    "we show that , neglecting this term , a large error is induced in the computation of the off diagonal conductivity in metals .",
