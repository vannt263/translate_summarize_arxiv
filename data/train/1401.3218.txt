    "our recent work in optical cavity qed has shown ground state quantum coherences generated by spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "these are a direct consequence of the internal structure of the rubidium atoms , and their response to small magnetic fields .",
    "superpositions of ground state zeeman sublevels undergo larmor precession and manifest their frequency in quantum beats on the conditional intensity , the correlation function @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to recent experiments @xcite , which aim for deterministic quantum control , the ground - state coherence in our experiment is both prepared and read out by spontaneous emission .    during these investigations",
    "@xcite we found that near resonant rayleigh scattering is responsible both for an increase on the frequency of oscillation as well as a decrease in amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "this contribution presents our study of quantum feedback protocols to restore the coherence and control the oscillation frequency .",
    "the time scales of the quantum beats are such that current experimental and theoretical tools allow us to perform the feedback @xcite .    our previous experiments on quantum feedback in optical cavity qed @xcite also worked on conditional intensities with weak drives .",
    "we controlled the oscillatory exchange of excitation between the atomic polarization and the cavity mode .",
    "the frequencies were a factor of five higher than the decay rates of the system .",
    "that protocol depended critically on the specific time of feedback application after a photon detection , as well as the electronic delay time .",
    "the protocols we are pursuing now rely on strong quantum feedback ; we require a single photon detection to act on the system .",
    "this is in contrast with recent quantum control studies : cavity qed experiments with rydberg atoms in superconducting cavities @xcite that used extensive calculations based on measurement outcomes to create and maintain a microwave fock state ; optical cavity qed experiments with two trapped cs atoms to prepare a two - atom spin state using measurements of the cavity transmission with bayesian feedback control @xcite ; and quantum control of the full ground state manifold of cs with off resonance optical polarimetry interrogation for measurement that point to future rf / microwave drives for more efficient actuators@xcite .",
    "we work with an optical cavity qed system in the intermediate coupling regime , where the single atom coupling to the excited state , @xmath1=1.5 mhz , is comparable to the decay rates of the cavity , @xmath2 s@xmath3 , and the atomic excited state , @xmath4 s@xmath3 .",
    "a detailed description of the apparatus is in ref .",
    "it consists of a 2 mm optical cavity , with 56 @xmath5 m mode waist , whose two orthogonal polarization modes , resonant with the @xmath6rb line of the cavity are degenerate to better than 0.2@xmath7 .",
    "we collect @xmath8rb atoms in a magneto optical trap ( mot ) 7.5 cm above the cavity and direct them into the mode of the cavity by having an imbalance on the optical forces from a 1.5 mm hole on the vacuum - located retro - reflecting optics ( quarter wave plate and mirror ) , an lvis by the acronym given by its inventors in ref .",
    "the resulting continuous atomic beam has an average velocity around 15 m / s depending on the mot parameters .",
    "the apparatus has the possibility to optically pump the atoms into the @xmath9 ground state before they enter the cavity .",

    "the atomic beam interacts with the two orthogonal modes of our high finesse optical cavity .",
    "the zeeman structure of the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 states in @xmath8rb have different magnetic @xmath12-factors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : simplemodel ] ) .",
    "the laser drives @xmath10 ( v polarization ) transitions , @xmath17 , ( straight arrows in the figure )",
    ". the spontaneous emission following atomic excitation can be through a circularly polarized photon ( continuous undulating arrows ) and they can transfer some of this energy to the orthogonal mode ( h polarization ) .",
    "the result is that through the appropriate detection of an h photon , which can not differentiate the origin of the spontaneous emission , we generate a long - lived zeeman superposition in the ground - state .",
    "its signature is a quantum beat seen in the correlation function @xmath0 of the mode with h polarization , the undriven mode . if an atom enters the cavity in the @xmath18 ground state , the detection of a photon in the orthogonal mode sets the atom in a superposition of @xmath19 ground states .",
    "the prepared superposition then evolves in the magnetic field , acquiring a relative phase , until another @xmath10 excitation transfers the developed ground - state coherence to the excited state ; subsequently , detecting a second ( h polarized ) photon projects the atom back into its starting state .",
    "the sequence overall realizes a quantum eraser @xcite , as the intermediate ground - state is not observed .",
    "however , there can be several intervening @xmath10 spontaneous emissions ( rayleigh scattering ) before the second h polarized photon  a @xmath14 transition  can occur @xcite .",
    "each of these quantum jumps interrupts the atomic dipole and causes a small phase advance on the ground - state coherence .",
    "the small phase shifts accumulate over time to become a frequency shift  @xcite .",
    "the shift has decoherence from the randomness of the jumps that causes phase diffusion , which itself dephases the coherence .",

    "the cavity supports two degenerate modes of orthogonal linear polarization ( h and v ) . during their @xmath20 transit ,",
    "the atoms interact with the orthogonally polarized modes and can spontaneously emit into the cavity .",

    "this device generates amplitude modulation sidebands on the light . the upper sideband drives the system .",
    "the setup allows us to rapidly manipulate the amplitude of the drive .",
    "we use a digital delay generator ( dg ) to generate a fast electronic pulse , variable in time , that opens an rf attenuator , to feed the eom . the ttl pulse out of the apds",
    "travels to a correlator card , where each pulse arrival is time - stamped and stored .",
    "we split one of the apd ttl pulses before reaching the correlator card and use it to trigger the dg , which then drives the attenuator .",
    "we detect the coherence , oscillating directly at the larmor frequency , using an interference process between the signal generated by the spontaneous emission and a small part of the light exiting the drive mode using a half wave plate ( hwp in fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "the decoherence of the superposition is intimately related the drive laser @xcite .",
    "the protocol to correct for this consists of reducing the amplitude of the @xmath10 drive to the cavity after a pre - set time from the detection of the first photon , and then returning the amplitude to the previous level after a fixed time to look at the oscillations .",
    "since the frequency of oscillation is , to first order , set by the larmor precession frequency ; the atoms preserve the phase without interrogation , continuing their oscillation in the ground state .",

    "the detection at the output of the cavity ( see fig . [",

    "the effect is present in a multilevel atom and persists for small detunings of the order of the excited state linewidth @xmath52 .",

    "the continuous black trace is without any post selection , it shows the average of all possible events .",
    "if we set a maximum of 14 spontaneous emission events during the 300 atomic lifetimes , after the initial detection on the undriven mode , we get the dashed grey curve .",

    "the implementation of these protocols with data from an experiment will be complicated , but we are looking into a few possibilities .",
    "these are preliminary calculations , but they are encouraging enough that we are setting the extra detection port for the driven mode on the upgraded apparatus .",
    "this will allow us to time stamp all the photons escaping the driven mode and then perform the post selection on the full records .",
    ", with no post selection ( black line ) with 100 ns conditioning window ( gray dashed line).,title=\"fig:\"][h ]    we recently modified our @xmath56 analysis program to include a time - filtering routine .",
    "this new process checks the time of arrival of the next photon .",
    "if this time is shorter than a specified window , then this photon as well as the previous one are not considered in the construction of the correlation function .",
    "when such an event is detected , the program skips a set time worth of photon clicks .",
    "the rationale behind this kind of `` high - pass time '' filter is that if we are interested only in extracting from the data the photon arrivals when only one atom is in the cavity , then we must choose a window of the order of the excited state lifetime (  26 ns ) .",

    "characterize this by an effective number of atoms ( @xmath57 ) @xcite that given our parameters means that on average there are seven randomly distributed atoms on the cavity .",
    "the signature of having only one atom in the cavity is a modification of the correlation function that shows the oscillations on top of a gaussian looking background that comes from the transit time of the atom across the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : post3 ] shows preliminary results of the correlation function showing quantum beats . the black line has no post selection while the gray dashed line explicitly deletes a region of 5 @xmath5s after two events happen on a window of 100 ns .",

    "it is clear that the single atom signature is visible .",
    "we continue to improve the filtering algorithm and expect to be able to look at what remains in the correlation function around @xmath55 .",
    "the results are encouraging .",
    "spontaneous emission prepares quantum beats from the ground state .",
    "quantum beats have sufficiently long coherence to interrogate and study .",
    "however , too much spontaneous emission can destroy the quantum beats creating frequency shifts and decoherence .",
    "the origin of this shifts and broadening has to do with the phase jumps associated with the unobserved rayleigh scattering in our system .",
    "the implementation of strong feedback control significantly decreases the decoherence and frequency shifts .",
    "the protocol consists of turning off the drive to the cavity qed system after the first photon detection let the superposition evolve in the dark .",
    "this enhances the lifetime of the coherence and also improves the visibility of the conditional quantum beats .",
    "post selection of data shows changes in the correlation function consistent with one photon .",
    "simulations show other avenues for post selection protocols .",
