    "bouncing models @xcite have been widely investigated as a solution of the singularity problem , and possibly as an alternative to inflation as long as it can also solve , by its own way , the horizon and flatness problems , and justify the power spectrum of primordial cosmological perturbations inferred by observations .    in the case where the contracting phase of a regular bouncing model is dominated by some matter content with a constant ratio between pressure and energy density , @xmath3 const . , it was shown by many authors , in different frameworks @xcite , that this matter content must be dust - like , perhaps connected to cold dark matter , in order to obtain a scale invariant spectrum of scalar and tensor cosmological perturbations .",
    "on the other hand , since 1998 @xcite , cosmologists were confronted with a highly unexpected observation : the universe is presently in a state of accelerated expansion .",
    "this may be caused by the existence of some field violating the strong energy condition , called dark energy , by a modification of general relativity at large scales , by the influence of some large scale inhomogeneities , or simply by a well suited cosmological constant .",
    "this last option is by far the simplest explanation to the present acceleration of the universe , although it poses a problem to quantum field theory on how to accommodate its observed value with vacuum energy calculations .",
    "anyway , the so called @xmath4cdm standard model assumes that there exists a cosmological constant term in einstein s equations , which becomes dynamically important when the typical scale of the universe has the size of the present hubble radius .    in bouncing models without a cosmological",
    "constant , vacuum initial conditions for quantum cosmological perturbations are set in the far past of the contracting phase , when the universe was very big and almost flat , justifying the choice of an adiabatic minkowski vacuum in that phase .",
    "however , if a cosmological constant is present , the asymptotic past of bouncing models will approach de sitter rather than minkowski spacetime .",
    "furthermore , the large wavelengths today become comparable with the hubble radius in the contracting phase when the universe was still slightly influenced by the cosmological constant .",
    "hence , the existence of a cosmological constant can modify the spectrum and amplitude of cosmological perturbations .",
    "note that this is not a question for inflation because initial conditions for quantum perturbations and the moment of hubble radius crossing in such models take place when the cosmological constant is completely irrelevant : the universe is fully dominated by the inflaton field .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate this issue in detail in the context of a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker geometry with a cosmological constant , and a scalar field with potential allowing a constant equation of state @xmath0 for the background field , like the exponential potential in the scenario without cosmological constant .",
    "hence , this paper can be considered as an extension of ref .",
    "@xcite through the introduction of a cosmological constant in the model . here , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , our background scenario is not intended to be a fully realistic description of the contracting phase of a bouncing model , but to yield a suitable framework to calculate the spectrum of linear cosmological perturbations in bouncing models , and to study how it depends on the presence of a cosmological constant and on the equation of state of the matter content . in our model",
    ", the bounce itself takes place at very short length scales , where the cosmological constant has no role .",
    "hence , its presence does not modify the evolution of the background and perturbations in that period , and the descriptions provided in refs .",
    "@xcite can still be considered to be valid at the bounce .",
    "the main difference is originated from processes much before the bounce , when the initial conditions are set and the cosmological constant is not irrelevant . in that case , a minkowski adiabatic vacuum can only be defined in a precise time domain , i.e. , at the end of cosmological constant domination , but when the universe was still very big and rarefied . however , even in this time domain , as the length scale associated with the cosmological constant , given by the present acceleration of the universe , is not much bigger than the long wavelengths of physical interest today , the spectrum of these scales can still be slightly affected by the cosmological constant .",
    "and indeed we will show , analytically and numerically , that the usual result for bouncing models , namely , that the fluid should satisfy @xmath2 in order to have an almost scale invariant spectrum of long wavelength perturbations , still holds , but the presence of the cosmological constant induces small oscillations and a small running towards a red - tilted spectrum for these scales .    in the next section",
    ", we will present the background model and obtain the equations for the evolution of cosmological perturbations on this background . in section iii , we will discuss the choice of the initial state of the cosmological perturbations on this background . in section iv , we will obtain analytically and numerically the power spectrum of perturbations for the model presented in section iii , and discuss its physical consequences .",
    "we end up with the conclusions .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we obtained @xmath195 , evaluated it at very small @xmath143 ( @xmath196 ) , expressed the result in conformal time ( whose relation with @xmath143 is trivial at field domination ) , multiplied the result by @xmath197 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqr23 ] ) ) , and differentiated the final result with respect to @xmath45 in order to isolate @xmath156 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] .     for @xmath157 and @xmath158 evaluated at @xmath198 .",
    "the solid lines show the numerical results and the dotted ones show , for comparison , a curve proportional to @xmath199.,title=\"fig:\"][fig4 ]     evaluated at @xmath198 , obtained using @xmath200 .",
    "the solid line indicates the result obtained using @xmath111 , the dashed line for @xmath201 and the dotted line for @xmath202 .",
    "note that the oscillations become smaller for smaller @xmath203 , showing that they are due to the presence of the cosmological constant .",
    "this result is in agreement to eq .",
    "( [ sifinal]).,title=\"fig:\"][fig5 ]    it can be seen that @xmath156 and @xmath204 follow the predicted behaviour , @xmath205 and @xmath206 , for @xmath207 .",
    "we have also verified that small oscillations and a red - tilted running with amplitudes decreasing with @xmath127 are superimposed to the power law overall behaviour , as predicted in eqs .",
    "( [ eqr24 ] ) and ( [ sifinal ] ) .",
    "note from fig .",
    "5 that the oscillations do indeed become smaller for smaller @xmath203 , showing that they are a consequence of the presence of the cosmological constant .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the effects of the presence of a cosmological constant in the contracting phase of a bouncing model .",
    "it turns out that the initial vacuum state , usually determined in the contracting phase when the universe was very large and rarefied , is affected by the presence of the cosmological constant . in order to get an almost scale invariant spectrum ,",
    "one still must have some phase with dust - like contraction , but now the spectral index gets a red - tilted running and oscillations directly caused by the cosmological constant .",
    "it is interesting to realize that bouncing models allow such an important role to the cosmological constant in the physics of primordial cosmological perturbations , which is not at all the case for always expanding models .",
    "this opens a new area of research , which is to investigate the influence of other models of dark energy on the primordial spectrum of bouncing models .. in other words , if the universe had really bounced in the past , investigating its primordial spectrum can yield information about dark energy .",
    "there is also the question about the possibility of an enormous growth of perturbation amplitudes in the deflationary contraction in the far past of the model , as discussed in other contexts @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the cosmological constant in our model is small and this almost de sitter deflation will take place when the universe was very large compared to the present hubble radius , and for a fixed time interval . in conformal time",
    ", this time interval can be estimated using eq .",
    "( [ conformal ] ) by saying that it should be smaller than @xmath208 given by this equation when @xmath209 . taking the usual values @xmath111 and @xmath210",
    ", one can see that @xmath211 .",
    "note that for a cosmological constant dominated model ( @xmath212 ) , one would obtain @xmath213 .",
    "let us examine the behaviour of the bardeen potential in this phase . from eq .",
    "( [ bds ] ) we obtain that    @xmath214    for @xmath215 .",
    "hence , as this almost de sitter deflationary phase will not take long enough in conformal time , @xmath211 , because of the smallness of the cosmological constant , perturbations will not grow alarmingly in this epoch .",
    "now , once the universe leaves this deflationary contraction to a non - deflationary contraction when it is still very large , then it can be subjected to dissipation effects , as the ones discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which could dissipate the existing inhomogeneities .",
    "another approach to this problem should be to think in terms of the anthropic principle and state that the universe is composed fundamentally by a small cosmological constant ( dark energy ) and some matter content as the one used in our model ( dark matter ? ) .",
    "in many regions it will expand to de sitter and it will freeze , in some it will contract inhomogeneously , and in a few homogeneous regions within one particle horizon size it may contract to make a bounce , where new particles ( photons and baryons ) will be created , and expand again to a universe with some galaxies and stars where intelligent life can exist .",
    "the results of our paper can then be applied to this last possibility , the only one which can interest us . of course",
    "these tentative answers to this basic question must be worked out more precisely , but we think that a final and complete answer to the issue on why the primordial universe was so homogeneous , in any cosmological scenario , demands a theory of initial conditions , perhaps quantum cosmology . one interesting investigation should be a quantum cosmological analysis of eternal asymptotically ( in time ) de sitter models .",
    "our approach here was concentrated on general features of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in the presence of a cosmological constant in general bouncing models , and because of that we were not able to fix the amplitude of the perturbations .",
    "our next step will be to take a specific model in which the physics at the bounce fixes the bounce scale , and hence the amplitude of the perturbations , in order to determine the influence of the new fetures of the spectrum of primordial perturbations we obtained in this paper in the anisotropies of the microwave background radiation , and to compare the results with observations .",
    "another interesting problem should be to investigate the situation where the required dust - like contraction was not caused by a scalar field but by a hidrodynamical fluid with @xmath216 . in this case",
    ", the prescription of an adiabatic vacuum can be much more involved because of the smallness of the sound horizon .",
