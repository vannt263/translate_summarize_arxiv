    "the meson - baryon scattering processes are an important test for effective field theories which aim at reproducing qcd at small energies , where the effective degrees of freedom are hadrons rather than quarks and gluons . in this",
    "talk we focus on the strangeness sectors , because here the acceptable effective field theories were until recently much less developed and also the empirical data set still leaves much room for different theoretical interpretations . in the near future",
    "the new da@xmath0ne facility at frascati could deliver new data on kaon - nucleon scattering @xcite and therewith help to establish a more profound understanding of the role played by the @xmath1 flavor symmetry in hadron interactions .",
    "a reliable construction of the meson - baryon scattering amplitudes is of major importance since they play a central role in the study of meson properties in cold nuclear matter .",
    "the task to construct a systematic effective field theory for the meson - baryon scattering processes in the resonance region is closely linked to the fundamental question as to what is the nature of baryon resonances . here",
    "we support the conjecture @xcite that baryon resonances not belonging to the large-@xmath2 ground states are generated dynamically by coupled - channel dynamics @xcite . for a comprehensive discussion of this issue",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "this conjecture was the basis of the phenomenological model @xcite , which generated successfully non - strange s- and d - wave resonances by coupled - channel dynamics describing a large body of pion and photon scattering data . in recent works @xcite , which will be reviewed here ,",
    "it was shown that chiral dynamics as implemented by the @xmath3bs(3 ) approach @xcite provides a parameter - free prediction for the existence of a wealth of strange and non - strange s- and d - wave wave baryon resonances .    in the second part of this talk the application of chiral coupled - channel dynamics to nuclear matter properties of the antikaon , the @xmath4 s - wave resonance and the @xmath5 p - wave resonance will we discussed .",
    "an attractive modification of the antikaon spectral function was already anticipated in the 70 s by the many k - matrix analyses of antikaon - nucleon scattering ( see e.g. @xcite ) which predicted considerable attraction in the subthreshold s - wave @xmath6 nucleon scattering amplitudes . in conjunction",
    "with the low - density theorem @xcite this leads to an attractive antikaon spectral function in nuclear matter .",
    "as was pointed out first in @xcite the realistic evaluation of the antikaon self energy in nuclear matter requires a self consistent scheme .",
    "the feedback effect of an attractive antikaon spectral function on the antikaon - nucleon scattering process was found to be important for the hyperon resonance structure in nuclear matter .",
    "we present and discuss up - to - date results based on the chiral - coupled channel analysis of meson - baryon scattering data that included s- , p- and d - wave contributions @xcite .",
    "the starting point to describe the meson - baryon scattering process is the chiral su(3 ) lagrangian ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "a systematic approximation scheme arises due to a successful scale separation justifying the chiral power counting rules @xcite .",
    "our effective field theory of the meson - baryon scattering processes is based on the assumption that the scattering amplitudes are perturbative at subthreshold energies with the expansion parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the small scale @xmath8 is to be identified with any small momentum of the system .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking scale is @xmath9 with the parameter @xmath10 mev determined by the pion decay process .",
    "once the available energy is sufficiently high to permit elastic two - body scattering a further typical dimensionless parameter @xmath11 arises @xcite .",
    "since this ratio is uniquely linked to two - particle reducible diagrams it is sufficient to sum those diagrams keeping the perturbative expansion of all irreducible diagrams , i.e. the coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equation has to be solved .",
    "this is the basis of the @xmath12-bs(3 ) approach developed in @xcite .",

    "the terms in ( [ wt - term ] ) constitute the leading order s - wave interaction of goldstone bosons ( @xmath14 ) with the baryon - octet ( @xmath15 ) and baryon - decuplet ( @xmath16 ) states .",
    "the octet and decuplet fields , @xmath17 and @xmath16 , posses an appropriate matrix structure according to their su(3 ) tensor representation .",
    "the scattering process is described by the amplitudes that follow as solutions of the bethe - salpeter equation , @xmath18 where we suppress the coupled - channel structure for simplicity .",
    "the meson and baryon propagators , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are used in the notation of @xcite .",
    "we apply the convenient kinematics : @xmath21 where @xmath22 the initial and final meson and baryon 4-momenta .",
    "the bethe - salpeter scattering equation is recalled for the case of meson baryon - octet scattering .",
    "an analogous equation holds for meson baryon - decuplet scattering process ( see e.g. @xcite ) . referring to the detailed discussion given in @xcite we assume a systematic on - shell reduction of the bethe - salpeter interaction kernel leading to the effective interaction @xmath23 used in ( [ bs - coupled ] ) .",
    "the latter is is expanded according to chiral power counting rules .",

    "we insist on the renormalization condition , @xmath31 together with the natural choice for the subtraction points , @xmath32 as explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "the renormalization condition reflects the basic assumption our effective field theory is based on , namely that at subthreshold energies the scattering amplitudes can be evaluated in standard chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this is achieved by supplementing ( [ bs - coupled ] ) with ( [ ren - cond],[eq : sub - choice ] ) .",
    "the subtraction points ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) are the unique choices that protect the s - channel baryon - octet masses manifestly in the p - wave @xmath33 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the merit of the scheme @xcite lies in the property that for instance the @xmath34 and @xmath35 scattering amplitudes match at @xmath36 approximately as expected from crossing symmetry . in @xcite",
    "we suggested to glue s- and u - channel unitarized scattering amplitudes at subthreshold energies .",
    "this construction reflects our basic assumption that diagrams showing an s - channel or u - channel unitarity cut need to be summed to all orders at least at energies close to where the diagrams develop their imaginary part . by construction",
    ", a glued scattering amplitude satisfies crossing symmetry exactly at energies where the scattering process takes place . at subthreshold energies crossing symmetry",
    "is implemented approximatively only , however , to higher and higher accuracy when more chiral correction terms are considered . insisting on the renormalization condition ( [ ren - cond],[eq : sub - choice ] ) guarantees that subthreshold amplitudes match smoothly and therefore the final glued amplitudes comply with the crossing - symmetry constraint to high accuracy .",
    "the natural subtraction points ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) can also be derived if one incorporates photon - baryon inelastic channels .",
    "then additional constraints arise . for instance",
    "the reaction @xmath37 , which is subject to a crossing symmetry constraint at threshold , may go via the intermediate states @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the perturbative nature of subthreshold amplitudes , a crucial assumption of the @xmath12-bs(3 ) approach proposed in @xcite , is not necessarily true in phenomenological coupled - channel schemes in @xcite . using the subtraction scales as free parameters , as advocated in @xcite ,",
    "may be viewed as promoting the counter terms of chiral order @xmath40 to be unnaturally large . if the subtraction scales are chosen far away from their natural values ( [ eq : sub - choice ] )",
    "the resulting loop functions are in conflict with chiral power counting rules @xcite .",
    "though unnaturally large @xmath40 counter terms can not be excluded from first principals one should check such an assumption by studying corrections terms systematically .",
    "a detailed test of the naturalness of the @xmath40 counter terms was performed within the @xmath12-bs(3 ) scheme @xcite demonstrating good convergence in the channels studied without any need for promoting the counter terms of order @xmath40 .",
    "possible correction terms in the approach followed in @xcite have so far not been studied systematically for meson - baryon scattering . moreover , if the scheme advocated in @xcite were applied in all eleven isospin strangeness sectors with @xmath41 a total number of 26 subtraction parameters arise .",
    "this should be compared with the only ten counter terms of chiral order @xmath40 contributing to the on - shell scattering amplitude at that order @xcite . selecting only the operators that are leading in the large-@xmath2 limit of qcd out of the ten @xmath40 operators only four survive @xcite .",
    "we conclude that it would be inconsistent to apply the approach used in @xcite in all isospin strangeness channels without addressing the above mismatch of parameters .",
    "our scheme has the advantage over the one in  @xcite that once the parameters describing subleading effects are determined in a subset of sectors one has immediate predictions for all sectors @xmath42 .",
    "a mismatch of the number of parameters is avoided altogether since the @xmath40 counter terms enter the effective interaction kernel directly .",
    "given the subtraction scales ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) the leading order calculation is parameter free .",
    "of course chiral correction terms do lead to further so far unknown parameters which need to be adjusted to data . within the @xmath3bs(3 )",
    "approach such correction terms enter the effective interaction kernel @xmath23 rather than leading to subtraction scales different from ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) as it is assumed in  @xcite .",
    "in particular the leading correction effects are determined by the counter terms of chiral order @xmath43 .",
    "the effect of altering the subtraction scales away from their optimal values ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) can be compensated for by incorporating counter terms in the chiral lagrangian that carry order @xmath40 .",
    "there is a long standing controversy to what is the nature of s - wave baryon resonances . before the event of the quark model",
    "several such states have been successfully generated in terms of coupled - channels dynamics @xcite .",
    "these early calculations are closely related to modern approaches based on the leading - order chiral su(3 ) lagrangian . the interaction used in @xcite matches the weinberg - tomozawa interaction ( [ wt - term ] ) if expanded in a taylor series @xcite .",
    "the main difference of the early attempts from computations based on the chiral lagrangian is the way the coupled - channel scattering equation is regularized and renormalized .",
    "the crucial advance over the last years in this field is therefore a significant improvement of the systematics , i.e. how to implement corrections terms into coupled - channel dynamics . in the su(6 ) quark - model approach s - wave resonances belong to a @xmath44-plet , that contains many more resonance states @xcite .",
    "an interesting question arises : what is the role played by the d - wave resonances belonging to the very same @xmath44-plet as the s - wave resonances .",
    "naively one may expect that chiral dynamics does not make firm predictions for d - wave resonances since the meson baryon - octet interaction in the relevant channels probes a set of counter terms presently unknown . however , this is not necessarily so .",
    "since a d - wave baryon resonance couples to s - wave meson baryon - decuplet states chiral symmetry is quite predictive for such resonances under the assumption that the latter channels are dominant .",
    "this is in full analogy to the analysis of the s - wave resonances @xcite that neglects the effect of the contribution of d - wave meson baryon - decuplet states .",
    "the empirical observation that the d - wave resonances @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 have large branching fractions ( @xmath48 ) into the inelastic @xmath49 channel , even though the elastic @xmath50 channel is favored by phase space , supports our assumption .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the s- and d - wave baryon resonance spectrum that arises in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "the latter is not defined uniquely depending on the magnitude of the current quark masses , @xmath51 .",
    "we consider two scenarios @xcite . in the light su(3 ) limit the current quark masses are chosen such that one obtains @xmath52 mev .",
    "the second case , the heavy su(3 ) limit , is characterized by @xmath53 mev . in the su(3 ) limit meson baryon - octet scattering is classified according to , @xmath54 the leading order chiral lagrangian predicts attraction in the two octet and the singlet channel but repulsion in the 27-plet and decuplet channels . as a consequence in the heavy su(3 )",
    "limit the chiral dynamics predicts two degenerate octet bound states together with a non - degenerate singlet state @xcite . in the light su(3 ) limit all states disappear leaving no clear signal in any of the speed plots . in the @xmath55 sector",
    "the weinberg - tomozawa interaction is attractive in the octet , decuplet and 27-plet channel , but repulsive in the 35-plet channel , @xmath56 therefore one may expect resonances or bound states in the former channels .",
    "indeed , in the heavy su(3 ) limit we find @xmath57 bound states in this sector forming an octet and decuplet representation of the su(3 ) group .",
    "we do not find a 27-plet - bound state reflecting the weaker attraction in that channel .",
    "however , if we artificially increase the amount of attraction by about 40 @xmath58 by lowering the value of @xmath59 in the weinberg - tomozawa term , a clear bound state arises in this channel also .",
    "a contrasted result is obtained if we lower the meson masses down to the pion mass arriving at the light su(3 ) limit .",
    "then we find neither bound nor resonance octet or decuplet states . this pattern is a clear prediction of chiral couple - channel dynamics which should be tested with unquenched qcd lattice simulations @xcite .    using physical meson and baryon masses the bound - state turn into resonances as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2],[fig1 ] .",
    "in @xcite we generalized the notion of a speed @xcite to the case of coupled - channels in way that the latter reveals the coupling strength of a given resonance to any channel , closed or open .",
    "if a resonance with not too large decay width sits in the amplitude a clear peak structure emerges in the speed plot even if the resonance structure is masked by a background phase . in the case of s - wave resonances",
    "thresholds induce square - root singularities which should not be confused with a resonance signal .",
    "the speed plots of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show evidence for the formation of the @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 resonances close to their empirical masses .",
    "an additional @xmath64 state , mainly a su(3 ) singlet @xcite , can be found as a complex pole in the scattering amplitude close to the pole implied by the @xmath61 resonance .",
    "there is no clear signal for @xmath65 resonances at this leading order calculation .",
    "however , chiral corrections lead to a clear signal in this sector @xcite suggesting a state that may be identified with the @xmath66 resonance , the only well established s - wave resonance in this sector .",
    "the fact that a second resonance with @xmath67 is not seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , even though the heavy su(3 ) limit suggests its existence , we take as a confirmation of the phenomenological observation @xcite that the @xmath68 resonance couples strongly to the @xmath69 channel not considered here .",

    "the vertical lines show the opening of inelastic meson baryon - decuplet channels .",

    "[ fig1 ] speed plots of the @xmath55 sector are shown for all channels in which octet and decuplet resonance states are expected . it is a remarkable success of the @xmath12-bs(3 ) approach that it predicts the four star hyperon resonances @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 with masses quite close to the empirical values .",
    "the nucleon and isobar resonances @xmath45 and @xmath47 also present in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , are predicted with less accuracy .",
    "the important result here is the fact that those resonances are generated at all .",
    "it should not be expected to obtain already fully realistic results in this leading order calculation .",
    "for instance chiral correction terms are expected to provide a d - wave @xmath74-component of the @xmath45 .",
    "we continue with the peak in the ( 0,-3)-speeds at mass 1950 mev .",
    "since this is below all thresholds it is in fact a bound state .",
    "such a state has so far not been observed but is associated with a decuplet resonance @xcite .",
    "further states belonging to the decuplet are seen in the @xmath75- and @xmath76-speeds at masses 2100 mev and 1920 mev .",
    "the latter state can be identified with the three star @xmath77 resonance .",
    "finally we point at the fact that the @xmath78-speeds show signals of two resonance states consistent with the existence of the four star resonance @xmath72 and @xmath79 even though in the heavy su(3 ) limit we observed only one bound state .",

    "the present data set for antikaon - nucleon scattering leaves much room for different theoretical extrapolations to subthreshold energies @xcite .",
    "thus it is of crucial importance to apply effective field theory methods in order to control the uncertainties . in particular constraints from crossing symmetry and chiral symmetry",
