    "in recent years , online social networks providing various featured services have become an essential part in our lives . to enjoy more social network services ,",
    "users nowadays are usually involved in multiple online social networks simultaneously @xcite and there can be significant overlaps of users shared by different networks . as pointed out in @xcite , by the end of 2013 , @xmath1 of online adults are using multiple social sites at the same time .",
    "for example , @xmath2 of instagram users are involved in facebook concurrently and 53% twitter users are using instagram as well @xcite . formally , the common users involved in different networks simultaneously are named as the `` _ _ anchor users _ _ '' @xcite , while the remaining unshared users are called the `` _ _ non - anchor users _ _ '' @xcite .",
    "the connections between accounts of anchor users in different networks are defined as the `` _ _ anchor links _ _ ''",
    "@xcite and networks partially aligned by anchor links can be represented as `` _ _ partially aligned networks _ _ '' @xcite .",
    "* problem studied * : in this paper , we want to predict the _ anchor links _ across _ partially aligned networks _ , which is formally defined as the `` _ _ partial network alignment _",
    "_ '' problem .",
    "_ partial network alignment _ problem is very important for social networks and can be the prerequisite for many real - world social applications , e.g. , link prediction and recommendations @xcite , community detection @xcite and information diffusion @xcite . identifying accounts of anchor users across networks",
    "provides the opportunity to compose a more complete social graph with users information in all the networks they are involved in .",
    "information in the complete social graph is helpful for a better understanding of users social behavior in online social networks @xcite .",
    "in addition , via the predicted anchor links , cross - platform information exchange enables new social networks to start their services based on the rich data available in other developed networks . the information transferred from developed networks can help emerging networks @xcite to overcome the information shortage problem promisingly @xcite .",
    "what s more , the _ partial network alignment _ problem is a novel problem and different from existing link prediction works , like ( 1 ) _ traditional intra - network link prediction problems _",
    "@xcite , which mainly focus on predicting links in _ one single _ social network , ( 2 ) _ inter - network link transfer problems _",
    "@xcite , which can predict links in _ one single _",
    "network with information from multiple _ aligned networks _ , and ( 3 ) _ inferring anchor links across fully aligned networks _",
    "@xcite , which aims at predicting anchor links across _ fully aligned networks_.    the _ inferring anchor links across fully aligned networks _",
    "problem @xcite also studies the _ anchor link prediction _ problem .",
    "however , both the problem setting and method proposed to address the `` _ _ network alignment _ _ '' problem between two _ fully aligned networks _ in @xcite are very ad hoc and have many disadvantages .",
    "first of all , the full alignment assumption of social networks proposed in @xcite is too strong as fully aligned networks can hardly exist in the real world @xcite .",
    "secondly , the features extracted for _ anchor links _ in @xcite are proposed for foursquare and twitter specifically , which can be hard to get generalized to other networks .",
    "thirdly , the classification based link prediction algorithm used in @xcite can suffer from the _ class imbalance _",
    "problem @xcite .",
    "the problem will be more serious when dealing with _ partially aligned networks_. finally , the matching algorithm proposed in @xcite is designed specially for _ fully aligned networks _ and maps all users ( including both _ anchor _ and",
    "_ non - anchor _ users ) from one network to another network via the predicted anchor links , which will introduce a large number of non - existing anchor links when applied in the partial network alignment problem .    totally different from the `` _ _ inferring anchor links across fully aligned networks _ _ '' problem @xcite , we study a more general _ network alignment _ problem in this paper .",
    "firstly , networks studied in this paper are partially aligned @xcite , which contain large number of anchor and non - anchor users @xcite at the same time .",
    "secondly , networks studied are not confined to foursquare and twitter social networks . a minor revision of the `` _ _ partial network alignment _ _ '' problem can be mapped to many other existing tough problems , e.g. , large biology network alignment @xcite , entity resolution in database integration @xcite , ontology matching @xcite , and various types of entity matching in online social networks @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the _ class imbalance _ problem will be addressed via link sampling effectively in the paper .",
    "finally , the constraint on _ anchor links _ is `` @xmath0 '' ( i.e. , each user in one network can be mapped to at most one user in another network ) .",
    "across partially aligned networks , only anchor users can be connected by anchor links . identifying the non - anchor users from networks and pruning all the predicted potential anchor links connected to them",
    "is a novel yet challenging problem .",
    "the `` @xmath0 '' constraint on anchor links can distinguish the `` _ _ partial network alignment _ _ '' problem from most existing link prediction problems .",
    "for example , in traditional link prediction and link transfer problems @xcite , the constraint on links is `` _ _ many - to - many _ _ '' , while in the `` _ _ anchor link inference _",
    "_ '' problem @xcite across fully aligned networks , the constraint on _ anchor links _ is strict `` _ _ one - to - one _ _ '' .    to solve the `` _ _ partial network alignment _ _ '' problem , a new method , pna ( artial etwork ligner ) , is proposed in this paper .",
    "pna exploits the concept of _ anchor meta paths _ @xcite and utilizes the _ tensor decomposition _",
    "@xcite technique to obtain a set of _ explicit anchor adjacency features _ and _ latent topological features_. in addition , pna generalizes the traditional _ stable matching _ to support partially aligned network through _ self - matching _ and _ partial stable matching _ and introduces the a novel matching method , _ generic stable matching _ , in this paper .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formulation ] , we will give the definition of some important concepts and formulate the _ partial network alignment _ problem .",
    "pna method will be introduces in sections  [ sec : feature_extraction]-[sec : truncation ] .",
    "section  [ sec : experiment ] is about the experiments .",
    "related works will be given in section  [ sec : relatedworks ] .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "before introducing the method pna , we will first define some important concepts and formulate the _ partial network alignment _ problem in this section .",
