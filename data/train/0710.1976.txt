    "in southern india , there are many great female mathematicians who solve a complicated line pattern every morning , with white rice powder on the ground .",
    "the pattern is drawn around a grid pattern of dots so that the lines minimally encircle each dot , which is so called `` kolam '' pattern in tamil . among them , one - line drawings or the `` infinite kolam '' introduced nicely in gerdes(1990 ) , have some special meaning not only ethnologically but also mathematically ( fig.1 ) .",
    "for example , we can address the following simple question : how many can we draw such patterns / diagrams for a given grid pattern of dots ? for a particular grid pattern ( 1 - 3 - 1 ) in fig.1 .",
    ", it is not difficult to find that there is only one infinite kolam . but what happens when we have a bigger size of the grid pattern , say @xmath0 or @xmath1 ?        as one can easily confirm by hand , the problem turns out to be very hard , if one simply follows the general rules for kolam , which will be given in the next section , and judge if thus drawn kolam is infinite kolam or not .",
    "one may think that such a search problem is even np complete : substantial computational effort is required for finding the solution .",
    "however , there seem to be some ways or algorithms to reduce such effort .    one way is to use the mirror curve method .",
    "since more than a decade ago , it has been shown that the infinite kolam can be constructed as mirror curves in regular lattices ( see for example gerdes(1990),jablan(to appear ) and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , we can relatively easily construct some of the simplest examples of infinite kolam by this method .",
    "this might lead us to the simplest way to construct all the possible patterns of the infinite kolam , or to the statement that `` infinite kolam is not np complete . ''",
    "however , it seems to be still very difficult to show them by this method .",
    "the answer to our question has not been shown yet by this method , nor has a proof for the statement",
    ".    there is another way to reduce the task , which is a knot theoretical way .",
    "when we remove the dots from the kolam patterns , the remaining line - drawings are merely the two - dimensional projections of corresponding link diagrams in knot theory ( kauffman,1991 ) .",
    "therefore , the kolam patterns can be described and analyzed by the techniques developed in or based on knot theory .",
    "the link diagram is such a diagram that consists of one or more knots  called components of the link .",
    "hence , the number of one component link diagrams gives the answer to our question .    in this paper , we focus on the so - called `` diamond kolam '' and show the way towards the answer .",
    "the diamond kolam is such kolam whose grid patterns of dots are all diamond - shaped .",
    "the simplest examples of diamond kolam are shown in fig.1 . if we successively write the number of dots in each row , those grid patterns can be represented by a sequence of numbers from the top row to the bottom as follows :    ( 1 - 3 - 1 ) , ( 1 - 3 - 5 - 3 - 1 ) , ( 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 1 ) , and so on .",
    "we use this notation in what follows . by using the knot - theory description of the kolam",
    ", we show how to find the solution , @xmath2 , the infinite kolam , and give the answer to our question in the diamond kolam case : 1 for ( 1 - 3 - 1 ) , 240 for ( 1 - 3 - 5 - 3 - 1 ) , and 11,661,312 for ( 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 1 ) without excluding symmetric solutions .",
    "the first two entries match the results in ( yanagisawa,2006 ) , and the final one has just been confirmed in another way by yanagisawa , where he examined all the cases of ( 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 1 ) kolam .",
    "unfortunately , we have not reach the general solution of the problem , that is , the general expression of the numbers for any size of the diamond kolam . not to mention for any grid pattern of dots .",
    "however , we have shown the key steps for the general solution , which inevitably gives a sketch of the proof for the statement `` infinite kolam is not np complete .",
    "'' a further discussion will be given in the final section from this mathematical point of view .",
    "note that the procedure given here is not restricted to the diamond kolam , and therefore it can be applied to any other shape or problem in the universe of kolam .",
    "in this section , we first present the problem together with the general rules for kolam patterns . secondly , the problem defined on the grid pattern of dots is translated into the problem on the corresponding checker - pattern lattice .",
    "then , the kolam patterns are replaced by mathematical expressions with the temperley - lieb algebra with some modification . during this process , we show how to express the kolam patterns in the morse link presentations of knot theory .",
    "finally , we introduce the upper - lower diagrammatic decomposition of the kolam , and its mathematical treatment in linear algebra , _",
    "i.e. _ , vectors , matrices , and metric . the examples for ( 1 - 3 - 1 ) , ( 1 - 3 - 5 - 3 - 1 ) are also given in each subsection .",
    "the precise results for ( 1 - 3 - 1 ) , ( 1 - 3 - 5 - 3 - 1 ) , ( 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 1 ) are given in the next section .      first , we reintroduce the problem : +   + there are a variety of extensions or modifications to a minimal set of the rules for kolam ( gerdes,1990;nagata et al.,2004;nagata et al.,2006 ) . therefore , to be more precise",
    ", we define here the general rules for kolam , which are the rules for the lines in kolam .",
    "note that the dots are placed on sites of a square lattice and ` edge ' is defined by a straight line segment connecting two nearest neighbourhood sites .",
    "+   + the closed line simply means no ends .",
    "the first rule mentions the crossing , but its order is generally not questionable because the patterns are usually drawn by fine granular objects .",
    "the second rule prescribes the basic paths for the line - drawings , which also implies that the paths are smooth short - cuts connecting the middle points nearest to each other .",
    "the rule further means that any other point of the edges are not allowed to be passed . in practice",
    ", the uncrossed two neighbouring lines are not exactly passing through the middle points of the edges but rather through their neighbourhood points .",
    "nonetheless , we define them as above to simplify the rules .",
    "the third rule restricts or attracts the paths just around the dots . with the rules",
    ", we have basically six patterns of lines around a dot ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the one - line drawing should also be defined here : a single closed smooth line with some self - crossings .",
    "it is intrinsically different from but historically influenced by the definition of euleric curves .",
    "note that , being inspired by nagata et al.(2004 ) , nagata et al.(2006 ) , and yanagisawa(2006 ) , we further focus on the diamond shaped grid pattern of dots , the diamond kolam which was mentioned in the previous section .",
    "now , we are ready to translate problem 2.1 defined on a grid pattern of dots into a problem on a checker - pattern lattice . according to rules 2.2 ,",
    "the vertex positions of the drawing ( including crossings ) are restricted to the neighbourhoods of the middle points of the edges .",
    "the rules further separate the possible vertices into two types : one is just below the dots ( we call this ` black site ' ) and the other is just aside the dots ( ` white site ' ) .",
    "then , one obtains the alternating b / w checker pattern lattice , somehow dual to the original ( fig.3 ) .",

    "therefore , it is natural to write these diagrams by the algebra known as the temperley - lieb algebra with the braid group ( kauffman,1991;temperley et al.,1971 ) , which contains the permutations , the cap , and the cup .",
    "the essence of the algebra is just the usual topologically equivalent operations on knots , so it can be easily expressed by diagrams .",
    "for example , the famous reidemeister moves are realised in the algebra , and are expressed as follows : +    1 .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 , 2 .",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "3 .   @xmath10 .",
    "+    once the diagrams are written down by the algebra , they can naturally be reduced to topologically equivalent simple diagrams and their corresponding algebraic polynomials in an appropriate way",
    ". however , the known polynomials , such as the alexander - conway polynomial or the jones polynomial , are only powerful for computing the knot invariants but not for counting the number of one - line drawings .",
    "therefore , we need another trick to extract the number from such polynomials of links .    here , we introduce a modification to the algebra so that it gives a polynomial in link components rather than for the knot .",
    "the modification consists of the full decomposition of @xmath11 operator in the temperley - lieb algebra into caps and cups , and the projection that eliminates the signs of crossings in diagrams .",
    "the diagrammatic features of this projection are drawn below :    c +    & = & , = ,    c +    & = & , = ,    c +    & = & ,    c +    = ,    c +    = ,    c +    = .",
    "these operations obviously preserve the number of link components . before deriving the polynomial ,",
    "let us first fix the mathematical notations for this morse link presentation .",
    "define the vertical strings by numbering them from left to right starting from one to @xmath12 as in fig.4 .",
    "then , define the operator @xmath13 which represents the permutation between the @xmath14-th and @xmath15-th strings .",
    "similarly , we define the operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and also @xmath18 which connects the @xmath14-th string from above to the @xmath15-th string downwards . by these definitions ,",
    "the black site is given by @xmath19  or   @xmath20 , while the white one is @xmath19  or   @xmath21 . the operation is simply an identity operation to this algebra so that we write this by @xmath22 . in order to view this algebra in a more convenient form",
    ", we change the diagrammatic order of top - to - bottom to the algebraic order of left - to - right .",
    "for example ,    c +   + i  j    = _ i  j _ i  j ,    c + ^i  ^i+1    = ^i  i+1 _ i  i+1 finally , we add the contraction between the cap and cup as follows . _",
    "i  j ^i  j = a , where @xmath23 can take any number so far .",
    "mathematically , there exist already the corresponding set of symbols : _",
    "i  j & = & _ i , j , ^i  j = _ i , j , ^i _  j & = & ^i_j , _ i",
    "j = _ i , j . by introducing another symbol @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , the complete set of the modified temperley - lieb algebra is given in the algebraic form in the appendix a.    in knot theory",
    ", it is known that any knot or link can be represented by the morse link presentation and by a sequence of operators  a monomial in the relevant algebra .",
    "indeed , one can see that any kolam diagram can be represented by a monomial of the four operators with the identity @xmath22 in our case , and s / he can derive a number as a result , following the above algebraic rules .",
    "for example , the infinite kolam in fig.1 gives the following monomial : & & & & = & & = & & = & & = a .",
    "the bracket @xmath26 is to denote the algebraic expression of diagrams , which will later be linked to the notion of bra and ket states of dirac .",
    "from the first line to the second , the monomial is re - ordered for computation . from the second to the third , the third and fourth lines of eq.(4 ) are used . from the third to the fourth , reidemeister move ( i ) is used twice .",
    "similarly , the non - infinite kolam in fig.1 reads & & & & = & & = & & = a^3 .",
    "from the first line to the second , reidemeister move ( i ) is used twice . from the second to the third , the operator decomposition by caps and cups are applied . hence , the former case ",
    "infinite kolam contains only one component , while the latter contains three components .    from this lesson ,",
    "it is now trivial that the diagram is one - line drawing if the corresponding monomial is reduced to the number : @xmath23 . besides",
    ", it is clear that if the diagram contains @xmath27 loops , or @xmath27 components , then the corresponding monomial becomes @xmath28 .",
    "if we calculate all the possible diagrams at once , it appears to be a polynomial in @xmath23 . in such a situation ,",
    "the number of one - component diagrams is simply given by the coefficient of the first order term of @xmath29 in the polynomial .",
    "there are various ways of obtaining this .",
    "for example , obtain the polynomial and differentiate it in a , then substitute @xmath30 into it . or ,",
    "define @xmath23 is grassmannian , so that @xmath31 and @xmath32 , so the diagram of more than one component vanish from the polynomial .",
    "it should be noted here that the latter implies a further reduction of the computational effort which we will mention later . at any rate",
    ", we should first clarify how to obtain the polynomial .",
    "for the derivation of the polynomial , we introduce the following two operators at the black and white sites : _ i & = & _ i  i+1 + ^i  i+1 _ i  i+1 , _ i & = & _ i  i+1 + 1 .",
    "in addition , we introduce the top state ( top state ) and the bottom state ( bot state ) , using the bra and ket notion of dirac : & top   state :  & & bottom   state :  & , for the ( 1 - 3- ... -(2n+1)- ... -3 - 1 ) diamond kolam .",
    "notice that they are trivially given by the maximum number of dots in rows .",
    "say , for the ( 3 - 3 - 3 ) kolam , they are @xmath33 and @xmath34 . consequently , the polynomial @xmath35 of the diamond kolam is given by : p ^2 ^3 ^2n ^3 ^2 , where the lower suffixes of the black and white circle operators are neglected for brevity .",
    "this reveals another interpretation of the diagram : the black and white circle operators act on the top state and transform it to another state , then the inner product between the transformed state and the bottom state produce a number .",
    "we will see this in the rest of this section .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the upper half of the diagram in an algebraic and knot theoretical way and show that they form a linear space of states .",
    "as it may be noticed , the family of diagrams expressed in fig.4 and by eq.(11 ) are totally symmetric .",
    "the symmetries include up - down symmetry , left - right symmetry : seven symmetries in total .",
    "if one focuses on the up - down symmetry , one can find that the calculation of the upper half diagram is just the same as of the lower half .",
    "indeed , we can see this more rigorously by defining the transposition of the states and the operators : & & ( o_1 o_2)^t = o_2^t o_1^t , ( o_1^t ) ^t = o_1 , & & ^t = , ^t = , ^t = , & & u^t = u,^t = 1 , where @xmath36 stands for any operator of the algebra and the suffixes are neglected as the transposition is defined under which they do not change .",
    "the definition means that & & ^t = , \\{^2 ...",
    "^n-1}^t = \\{^n-1 ... ^2 } , & & t : ^2 ... ^n-2 ^n-2 ... ^2 .",
    "hence , the problem is now further reduced to finding the form of the upper half diagram and calculating its inner product with its transposition acted by @xmath37 in the middle of the diagram : p & = & ^n-1 , where & & ^2 ... ^n-2 , & & ^t .",
    "diagrammatically , for instance , @xmath38 is given by =    ( 140,80 ) ( 5,10)(0,1)60 ( 15,10)(0,1)60 ( 25,10)(0,1)60 ( 35,10)(0,1)60 ( 45,10)(0,1)60 ( 55,10)(0,1)60 ( 65,10)(0,1)60 ( 75,10)(0,1)60 ( 85,10)(0,1)60 ( 95,10)(0,1)60 ( 105,10)(0,1)60 ( 115,10)(0,1)60 ( 125,10)(0,1)60 ( 135,10)(0,1)60 ( 5,70)(10,85)(15,70 ) ( 25,70)(30,85)(35,70 ) ( 45,70)(50,85)(55,70 ) ( 65,70)(70,85)(75,70 ) ( 85,70)(90,85)(95,70 ) ( 105,70)(110,85)(115,70 ) ( 125,70)(130,85)(135,70 ) ( 70,60 ) ( 50,40 ) ( 70,40 ) ( 90,40 ) ( 30,20 ) ( 50,20 ) ( 70,20 ) ( 90,20 ) ( 110,20 ) ( 60,50 ) ( 80,50 ) ( 40,30 ) ( 60,30 ) ( 80,30 ) ( 100,30 ) ( 2,-6)1 ( 12,-10)2 ( 22,-6)3 ( 32,-10)4 ( 42,-6)5 ( 52,-10)6 ( 62,-6)7 ( 72,-10)8 ( 82,-6)9 ( 90,-10)10 ( 100,-6)11 ( 110,-10)12 ( 120,-6)13 ( 130,-10)14    . +    each diagram in @xmath39 has @xmath40 legs , and it is reduced to the simplest topologically equivalent diagram , that is , @xmath41 of @xmath42 pairs for @xmath43 .",

    "such irreducible diagrams are distinguished from other topologically inequivalent irreducible diagrams , and therefore they form a linear space .",

    "the upper half diagram is now translated to a state in this state space , which is uniquely given by a linear combination of the basis states .",
    "the dual of the state space is apparently of the lower half .",
    "an explicit example will be given in the following sections .",
    "note that the coefficient of a basis state gives the occurrence of the basis state in the upper half diagram , which is usually given by a polynomial in @xmath23 .",
    "if we set @xmath30 in the upper half diagram , it cuts down the diagrams with trivial knots and leaves only the candidates for the infinite kolam .",
    "the polynomial in link components is given by the non - diagonalized inner product of the upper and lower half diagrams acted by a horizontal set of operators in the middle .",
    "the number of one - line drawings is now found as a coefficient of the leading term in the polynomial . it is stressed here that by up - down symmetry of the family of the kolam diagrams , it is sufficient to classify the upper half and the action of the operators on it .",
    "the matrix representation of the metric of the state space will give the answer .",

    "the degree of freedom of @xmath75 symmetric metric is @xmath76 . since the result is given by the metric , the steps of calculation is given by its degree of freedom and is roughly reduced from @xmath77 to @xmath78 . if we compare with the total number of diagrams @xmath79 in the ( 1 - 3 - 5 - 3 - 1 ) , our calculation ended dramatically with only @xmath80 cases .",
    "note that for the state calculation , we set @xmath30 .",
    "this is equivalent to have the grassmannian @xmath23 in the polynomial , which certainly reduced the task as was mentioned earlier .",

    "piling up such information guides us to the answer to problem 2.1 .",
    "such a component of problem 2.1 resembles the famous problem called the `` travelling salesman problem ( tsp ) '' . in our case ,",
    "the cities are replaced by the middle point of the edges in the initial lattice and the distances are assigned between them appropriately .",
    "the original tsp is known to be np - hard . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown that at each step of calculation we can judge which vertex be taken for the solution .",
