    "the behavior of strongly correlated electrons moving in reduced spatial dimensions continues to yield surprising new physics .",

    "in contrast to the square cuo@xmath1 lattice of the high - temperature superconductors , the organic molecules pair up into dimers , and these dimers form a triangular lattice .",
    "two other quasi two - dimensional materials with triangular lattices have been the subject of recent attention : the antiferromagnetic insulator cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 compound@xcite and the cobalt - based superconductor na@xmath3coo@xmath4h@xmath1o that may be an analog of the cuprate high - temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "neutron scattering experiments suggest the existence of deconfined spinon ( spin-@xmath12 ) excitations in the cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 once antiferromagnetic order has been eliminated by heating the sample to the relatively low temperature of approximately 0.6k , or upon application of a field parallel to the plane@xcite .",
    "geometric frustration of the spin - spin interactions is likely responsible for the observed spin - liquid behavior .",
    "as the cobalt atoms in the na@xmath3coo@xmath4h@xmath1o material also form a triangular lattice@xcite , and as they have further been argued to carry spin-@xmath12 moments@xcite , we tentatively group this system into the same category as @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x and cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 .",

    "the question of whether or not our weak - coupling analysis can describe this strong - coupling limit is tantamount to asking whether or not one or more intermediate - coupling fixed points intervene between the repulsive weak - coupling fixed point that is accessible in our rg analysis , and the attractive strong - coupling fixed point which describes the antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "finally as @xmath6 becomes larger than @xmath5 , the chains begin to decouple . in the extreme limit of independent chains",

    "the hartree - fock calculation yields @xmath162 and the slave - boson calculation gives @xmath163 for this transition .",
    "signs of re - entrant af order in our weak - coupling rg calculation , namely the relatively large size of the af channels in comparison with the bcs channels , are broadly consistent with this picture , as af tendencies can be a precursor to a transition to the insulating state .",
    "hubbard models have received extensive study in the context of high-@xmath164 superconductivity . we have reproduced the well - known result that there is an af instability at half - filling on the square lattice with repulsive on - site coulomb interaction and nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "furthermore , upon doping the system away from half filling , a crossover to a bcs regime with @xmath117 pairing symmetry occurs as expected .",
    "we have shown that it is important to retain subleading , formally irrelevant , corrections to the rg flows when the bare interaction is repulsive and the fermi surface is nearly nested .",
    "we also studied another way of triggering a bcs instability . keeping the system at half filling , but introducing the diagonal hopping @xmath6 as shown in fig .",

    "corresponding magnetic frustration kills the spin density wave , and cooper pairing dominates , at least if @xmath6 is not too large .",
    "this result suggests that superconductivity can occur in a model of strongly correlated electrons , even at half - filling .",
    "we emphasize that stripes are not expected to play a role here ; even moderate on - site coulomb repulsion should inhibit charge segregation at half - filling .",
    "the half - filled hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice has been proposed as a minimal description of the conducting layers of the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x organic superconductors .",
    "it is important to establish the pairing symmetry of the superconducting state of these materials .",
    "our theoretical results predict pairing of the @xmath117 type and in fact signs of such order have been seen experimentally .",
    "we did not find any evidence of spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "pairing symmetry of the type @xmath165 would occur if an attractive @xmath130 channel arose in addition to the @xmath117 channel .",
    "we find that attractive @xmath130 channels neither occur when next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath122 is included on the square lattice , nor when non - zero hopping @xmath6 is turned on along one of the two diagonal directions .    finally , we made contact with previous work on heisenberg antiferromagnets on the anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "our weak - coupling rg calculation shows af tendencies in two separate regimes  tendencies which seem to correspond with the two af ordered phases found previously at large-@xmath28 .",
    "in particular the portion of the phase diagram between the isotropic point ( @xmath9 ) and decoupled chains ( @xmath20 ) is the relevant region for the layered cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 antiferromagnet insulator material .",
