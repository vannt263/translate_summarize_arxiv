    "the influence of boundaries on the spectrum and observables of the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet has been studied in one @xcite and two @xcite dimensions .",
    "one of the results obtained in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case with the use of monte carlo simulations @xcite , the spin - wave approximation @xcite and the series expansion @xcite is the increased absolute values of the nearest - neighbor spin correlations near the boundary of the antiferromagnet . with distance from the surface",
    "the correlations tend rapidly to their bulk value revealing some oscillations .",
    "the arising pattern of spin correlations was called the comb structure .",
    "it was argued that the increased surface correlations can be a manifestation of a short - range valence - bond - solid ordering in the nel phase @xcite .    in this paper , we study the influence of the surface on the nearest - neighbor spin correlations in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) heisenberg antiferromagnet on a simple cubic lattice . using the spin - wave approximation we found the distribution of the spin correlations which resembles the comb - like structure of the 2d case : the correlations on the surface and between the surface and the second to the surface layers are in absolute value larger than in the bulk , while in the second layer and between the second and the third layers the correlations are smaller than in the bulk . in the 3d case ,",
    "the differences between the surface and the bulk values of the correlations are smaller than in the 2d case and decay more rapidly with distance from the surface  starting from the third layer the correlations differ only slightly from their bulk value .",
    "we relate the appearance of such a spin correlation pattern to the peculiar spectrum of spin excitations near the surface of the antiferromagnet .",
    "the spectrum involves bulk modes  standing spin waves and a quasi - two - dimensional mode of surface spin waves .",
    "these latter excitations are observed in the two surface layers , and they eject the bulk excitations from this region @xcite .",
    "thus the antiferromagnet appears to be divided into two regions with different spin excitations .",
    "as known , in the case of an infinite 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet the nearest - neighbor spin correlations are larger in absolute value than in the same antiferromagnet in the 3d case .",
    "hence the quasi - two - dimensional surface mode yields stronger correlations than the 3d bulk modes , which explains larger values of the correlations near the surface and the comb structure .",
    "it is worth noting that the description of perturbations introduced by the surface into the magnon spectrum is in many respects similar to the problem of a local defect in a crystal @xcite . in this latter problem",
    "the crystal is also divided into two regions with different elementary excitations  a vicinity of the defect with localized states and the rest of the crystal with bulk states .",
    "the axes are chosen in such a way that the antiferromagnet is in the half - space @xmath1 . here",

    "this observation conforms with the quasi - two - dimensional character of the surface mode and the fact that the modulus of the nearest - neighbor spin correlation in the infinite 2d antiferromagnet ( @xmath75 @xcite ) exceeds its value in the 3d case ( @xmath76 in our calculations , which is close to the values obtained earlier @xcite ) .",

    "the deviations from the bulk value are smaller than in the 2d case  the largest deviation is less than 5% in comparison with 12% in the latter case . besides , in the 3d case the influence of the edge decays more rapidly with distance from it  already in the third layer from the surface the correlations differ only slightly from the bulk value .",
    "again we notice that in this and deeper layers surface excitations are hardly perceptible in green s function and the spectrum is dominated by bulk modes .",
    "the increased correlations near the surface lead to the comb structure shown in fig .",
    "this structure is qualitatively similar to that obtained in the 2d case . from the above discussion",
    "it follows that the origin of such a spin correlation pattern is related to the existence of the surface spin - wave mode .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the effect of the surface on the nearest - neighbor spin correlations in the 3d spin-@xmath77 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "we have found that the spin correlations are enhanced on and close to the surface .",
    "we relate this enhancement to the existence of the surface spin - wave mode which ejects bulk modes from the region near the surface .",
    "the pattern of spin correlation in the 3d case is similar to that obtained recently in the 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
