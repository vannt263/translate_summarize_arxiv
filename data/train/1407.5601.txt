    "this year 2014 is the fiftieth anniversary of kondo s @xcite seminal paper `` resistance minimum in dilute magnetic alloys '' and the fortieth anniversary of wilson s @xcite renormalization paper about the kondo effect . for 50 years",
    "the kondo effect has been investigated with the most sophisticated theoretical methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "kondo @xcite solved the puzzle of the low - temperature resistance increase in dilute magnetic alloys @xcite above the kondo temperature @xmath1 .",
    "wilson calculated the kondo ground - state properties with a numerical renormalization , known as nrg theory .",
    "he observed a crossover from weak to strong coupling with increasing @xmath2 ( number of renormalization steps ) . in this article the fair solution of the kondo ground - state @xcite is applied to reproduce and interpret wilson s results ( fair = friedel artificially inserted resonance ) .",
    "the interaction between a magnetic impurity and the conduction electrons can be described by an exchange interaction with the potential @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the spins of the impurity and the conduction electrons .",
    "wilson invented and applied a number of tricks to tackle the kondo ground - state . using a band with a constant density of states and a band width of @xmath7 he divided all energies by @xmath8 yielding a band range @xmath9 with the fermi level at @xmath10 .",
    "then wilson made the ( almost ) infinite number of s - electron states @xmath11 manageable by dividing the band into energy cells .",
    "( i use the same symbol for a state , ( for example @xmath12)@xmath13when addressing it by a creation operator @xmath11 , an annihilation operator @xmath14 or as a wave - function @xmath15 ) .    in fig.4 in the appendix wilson s sub - division",
    "the ranges @xmath16 and @xmath17 are split at @xmath18 . in the next step wilson combined all states @xmath11 within each cell @xmath19 into a single state @xmath20 ( as the normalized sum of all states @xmath11 within the cell ) .",
    "these states @xmath20 i will call wilson states .",
    "they contain the full interaction of all electrons in the cell with the impurity .    from these states",
    "@xmath20 wilson constructed a series of new states @xmath21 .",
    "the state @xmath22 is the normalized sum of all the original band states @xmath11 .",
    "it is concentrated at the impurity , being a wannier state of the s - band .",
    "the next state @xmath23 surrounds the inner state @xmath22 and is itself surrounded by @xmath24 , etc .",
    "all the @xmath21 surround the magnetic impurity like onion shells .",
    "their width in real space increases each time by a factor of two .",
    "wilson chose the states @xmath25 in such a way that their hamiltonian is that of a linear chain with next nearest neighbor coupling . only the states",
    "@xmath26 interact with the impurity .",
    "he solved this hamiltonian by renormalization , i.e. by initially cutting off the chain at a small @xmath2 and solving the resulting hamiltonian @xmath27 by diagonalization . with the eigenstates of @xmath27 and the states",
    "@xmath28 @xmath29 wilson built the next hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "this nrg cycle is repeated .",
    "the number of basis states increases at each nrg step by a factor of four ( yielding @xmath31 ) but is generally limited to the 1000 states with the lowest energies .",
    "wilson compared the resulting excitation spectrum for a finite exchange interaction , for example @xmath32 with the spectrum for @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for a small number @xmath2 of nrg steps",
    "the spectrum of @xmath27 resembled that of @xmath33 .",
    "but after a critical number @xmath35 the spectrum crossed over , resembling the strong coupling case @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , wilson observed that the effective number of band electrons changed from odd to even at the transition .    with this work wilson achieved a break through in the low - temperature properties of the kondo effect . from the flow diagram and the fixed - point properties he obtained an effective hamiltonian for low temperatures .",
    "evaluation of his numerical results lead nozieres @xcite to the fermi - liquid description of the kondo ground - state .    despite this great success",
    ", it appears that wilson was not completely satisfied with his achievement . in his review article about the kondo renormalization wilson wrote ( @xcite , page 810 ) : `` why the crossover from weak to strong coupling takes place will not be explained .",
    "the author has no simple physical explanation for it .",
    "it is the result of a complicated numerical calculation '' .",
    "the reason that wilson had no simple interpretation of his results , i.e. , that the physics of the kondo ground - state is so veiled , is due to the fact that the wave function of the ground - state is so intangible . in nrg",
    "only a tiny fraction of the ground - state slater states can be maintained , which makes it very difficult to uncover the hidden physics .",
    "unfortunately the exact solution using the bethe - ansatz @xcite , @xcite , @xcite does not help because it is very difficult to extract the wave function from this ansatz .",
    "the author has developed in the past years a very compact solution for the kondo ground - state .",
    "it is known as the fair solution of the kondo ground - state .",
    "a short review is given in the festschrift to jaques friedel s 90 s birthday @xcite with extended references therein .",
    "although it is not an exact solution as the bethe - ansatz , it describes the physics of the kondo ground - state very well , and it is well equipped to answer wilson s implicit questions behind the physics of the nrg cross - over .",
    "kondo and wilson used a rigid magnetic impurity in their initial calculations .",
    "however , the most common group of magnetic impurities are 3d - atoms dissolved in a host .",
    "these impurities possess d - resonances .",
    "friedel @xcite and anderson @xcite showed that a sufficiently large coulomb exchange interaction between opposite d - spins creates a magnetic moment in the d - states .",
    "anderson reduced the ten - fold degeneracy of the fa - impurity to a two - fold degeneracy , making it de facto an impurity with @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( it is still called a d - impurity ) .",
    "this anderson model is used in most theoretical calculations of the kondo effect of d - impurities .",
    "schrieffer and wolff @xcite showed that for sufficiently strong coulomb interaction the anderson model yields the kondo effect .",
    "krishna - murthy , wilkins , and wilson @xcite performed nrg calculations for the fa - impurity and obtained an equivalent crossover . here",
    "i will discuss the kondo ground - state of the d - impurity because it demonstrates an interesting feed back of the singlet state on the electronic structure of its magnetic components .    in the fair approach we use the same trick as wilson to reduce the large number of s - electron states .",
    "the positive and negative bands of s - electrons are repeatedly sub - divided .",
    "but we stop the sub - division when a given number @xmath38 of energy cells @xmath39 is obtained , @xmath2 cells below and @xmath2 cells above the fermi level at energy zero . for each energy cell",
    "a wilson state is constructed .",
    "then the smallest level spacing between the resulting wilson states is ( next to the fermi level ) equal to @xmath40 ( in units of @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) .",
    "the corresponding size of the host is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fermi wave length . as in nrg",
    "the sample size  doubles when @xmath2 is increased by one . out of the wilson states two _ fair _ states @xmath45 and @xmath46 of spin - up and down are composed .",
    "the easiest way to explain the logic behind the fair approach is to compare it with a monarch whose subjects elect an ombudsman .",
    "this ombudsman does all the negotiation with the king relieving all the other subjects from this duty . in our case",
    "the @xmath47-state is the king and the spin - up s - states @xmath48 are the subjects .",
    "the latter elect the _ fair _ state @xmath45 as ombudsman who now exclusively negotiates with the @xmath47-state .",
    "this negotiation occurs in form of  s - d - hopping between @xmath47 and @xmath49 , from which the remaining subjects @xmath50 are excluded .",
    "their only function is to optimally elect and equip the ombudsman , i.e. _ fair _ state .",
    "( of  course , the remaining @xmath51 s - states @xmath48 have to be rebuilt so that they are orthogonal to @xmath45 , orthonormal to each other and diagonal in the band hamiltonian @xmath52 . because of the spin",

    "the internal orthogonality catastrophe is averted in the kondo ground - state .",
    "the physical reason for the synchronization at low energy is the following . in the kondo ground - state one has a competition between polarization energy and spin - flip energy .",
    "the spin - flip energy likes the two fair bands @xmath119 and @xmath120 to be synchronized because its ( transition ) matrix element is proportional to @xmath121 the polarization energy wants to shift the @xmath119 and @xmath120 bands in opposite directions . at large ( absolute ) energies",
    "@xmath122 the polarization energy wins . only for small energies of the order of @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath123 )",
    "does the spin - flip gain a minor victory by synchronizing the two bands in the very small energy range of the kondo energy .",
    "the synchronization of the two electron bases close to the fermi level , i.e. the suppression of the internal orthogonality catastrophe , is therefore a characteristic property of the kondo ground - state . in the process the two _ fair _ states @xmath74 and @xmath75 dramatically change their composition . in the singlet state for @xmath123",
    "they increase their weight at very small energies .",
    "wilson s renormalization can be roughly visualized by means of the single fig.3 .",
    "the figure corresponds to roughly @xmath124 nrg steps .",
    "if one wants to visualize the situation after @xmath125 nrg steps one removes in fig.3 the inner section for @xmath126 and joins the remaining outer parts , then one obtains , at least qualitatively , the relative energy shifts @xmath112 for @xmath127 .",
    "one easily recognizes that the crossover has not yet taken place . in our case",
    "it occurs in the range @xmath128 .",
    "wilson observed in his normalization sequence that * the spectrum changed as if one electron was removed at the fermi level * when the system had crossed over from weak to strong coupling .",
    "the general interpretation is that the impurity has bound one conduction electron and formed a singlet state , removing this electron from the band .    in fig.3 one",
    "recognizes that for the singlet state and @xmath124 the energies @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( for the same @xmath106 close to the fermi level , i.e. close to @xmath124 ) possess the same energy .",
    "an even number of band electrons fills the two fair bands up to the same energy .",
    "if one removes the inner forty states ( as discussed above ) then one obtains roughly the energy shifts for @xmath127 .",
    "now the energy shifts @xmath112 for the two fair bands in the singlet state differ roughly by one , @xmath129 @xmath130 or @xmath131 . here",
    "the energies @xmath101 lie about one level higher than @xmath102 ( for the same @xmath106 ) .",
    "now an odd number of electrons would fill the two fair bands up to the same energy .",
    "this is exactly what wilson observed .",
    "it is due to the synchronization of the electron states within @xmath0 of the fermi level .",
    "of course , this is only possible when there are levels within @xmath0 of the fermi level . for a spherical host",
    "this requires that the radius is larger than the kondo length .",
    "in summary the synchronization of the fair band states close to the fermi level averts the internal orthogonality catastrophe between the states @xmath97 and @xmath96 .",
    "it arises because it permits the system to lower its potential energy due to a tiny but finite spin - flip energy between these two states .",
    "it is also this synchronization that appears to remove an electron from the conduction band . at the same time",
    "the composition of the @xmath132 states @xmath74 and @xmath133 changes dramatically , which in turn changes the spectrum of the two fair bands .",
    "this changes the charge distribution around each @xmath134 within a radius of the kondo length , that is known as the kondo cloud .",
