    "the data therefore represent exclusively the damping coming from the fluid .",
    "we followed the recipe given by bruschi _",
    "_ to estimate the theoretical value of the damping @xcite .",
    "the values of the damping coming from different parts , such as the center plate and the comb electrodes , can be calculated using their phenomenological expression for the damping of an oscillating plate in close proximity to a substrate , the so - called slide film damping : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the area of the movable plate , @xmath8 is the gap between the plate and the substrate , @xmath89 is the viscosity at 1  atm , and @xmath74 is the knudsen number , which is the ratio of the mean free path to the size of the gap . @xmath74 quantifies the rarefaction of the fluid , thus the term in the parentheses can be understood as an effective viscosity . to account for the finite size of the different structures of the device , an effective gap size was used .",
    "the effective gap is given by @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath26 is the dimension of the oscillating structure along the motion of the plate .",
    "the slide film damping coming from the fingers ( dotted line ) and the fluid layer on top of the device ( dash - dotted line ) are almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the contribution from the fluid trapped between the gap ( dashed line ) ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : damping ] .",
    "thus , the total damping coefficient ( solid line ) is dominated almost exclusively by the damping coming from the fluid between the plates .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained by bruschi _",
    "furthermore , when the damping coefficient is normalized by the geometrical constant @xmath91 , both devices with different gaps exhibit a universal behaviour as a function of @xmath74 , accross the various flow regimes , from hydrodynamic to ballistic ( see fig .  [",

    "a strong temperature dependence on the resonance was observed . in the case of @xmath0he , the width of the resonance decreases as the temperature decreases .",
