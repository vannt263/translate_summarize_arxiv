    "in the 1980 s , feynman@xcite suggested that computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics could be more efficient than the classical ones . in the 1990 s ,",
    "the discovery of shors@xcite and grovers@xcite algorithms stimulated the search for the physical implementation of a quantum computer .",
    "diverse architectures have been tried@xcite and , among the most sucssesfull , we can cite nuclear magnetic ressonance ( nmr ) , ion - traps , optics@xcite .",
    "so far , the architecture that has achieved the largest number of qubits , namely seven , is nmr@xcite .",
    "the difficulty of implementing arbitrary number of qubits has motivated alternative approachs to quantum computing .",
    "it has been demonstrated that classical optics supports quantum computing , but the number of optical elements needed grows exponentially with the number of qubits@xcite .",
    "semi - classical architectures of quantum computing have also been suggested , with experimental implementations of the fourier transform of shor s algorithm@xcite , and the grover s search algorithm@xcite .",
    "the kernel of these proposals is to simulate the two - qubit gates by use of classical communication among quantum gates .",
    "a quite different approach , which is a kind of quantum / classical hybrid distributed computation , dubbed type ii quantum computation , has been adopted by yepez@xcite .",
    "a different kind of distributed quantum computation has also been suggested by other authors@xcite .",
    "the semi - quantum computer , or type ii quantum computer according to yepez@xcite , is in part quantum and in part classical .",
    "the quantum part is a set of individual genuine quantum computers with @xmath0 qubits each .",
    "these quantum nodes communicate classically with a classical computer , which may include several classical processors in parallel , as well [ fig.[fig1 ] ] .",
    "the key point here is that the quantum nodes are not intended to solve a whole algorithmic problem , but just a part , a subroutine , consistent with their supported number of qubits and coherence time .",
    "this hybrid architecture explores both quantum and classical parallelisms simultaneously .",
    "the quantum nodes send their partial results to the classical computer which , by its turn , performs some data processing and feeds back the quantum nodes with new tasks , which could be the same operation as before but on a new quantum state .",

    "our intention here is to look for evidences that tell us if this hybrid architecture could result in a computer that is faster than the classical ones . in order to do so",
    ", we are going to discuss how the search@xcite and fourier transform@xcite quantum algorithms could be adapted to the semi - quantum computer and investigate , through a complexity analysis , how they perform as compared to their pure classical and pure quantum counterparts . in section ii , we discuss the search problem .",
    "section iii is dedicated to the fourier transform .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "supose that a list of @xmath1 elements has to be searched , in order to find the @xmath2 solutions ( @xmath3 ) of a given problem , and that each solution can be identified by an appropriate oracle .",
    "classically , all the @xmath1 elements have to be tested and , therefore , this procedure costs @xmath4 operations .",
    "grover showed@xcite that searching quantum mechanically costs just @xmath5 , a quadratic improvement over the classical algorithm .",
    "the quantum algorithm is as follows .",
    "associating an orthonormal basis @xmath6 to the indices of the elements in the list , define a state vector formed by the equal superposition of these basis states ,    @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are the superposition of all the non - solutions , @xmath9 and the superposition of all the solutions , @xmath10 therefore @xmath11 can be rewritten as @xmath12 now build an operator @xmath13 , based upon the oracle for the problem ( see @xcite for details ) , whose action over @xmath11 is to increase its projection on @xmath8 [ fig.[fig2 ] ] . after applying @xmath13 a sufficient number of times",
    ", a measurement of the resulting state vector shall produce a solution of the problem with high probability .     the grover algorithm . ]",
    "the search problem is trivialy parallelizeable .",
    "simply divide the list of @xmath1 elements into sublists of size @xmath14 and search in the sublists .",
    "therefore , this problem can be adapted to the semi - quantum computer simply attributing to each quantum node a search in a sublist .",
    "now let s check out what we gain with this procedure .",
    "assuming @xmath0 qubits in the quantum node , the list can be divided into @xmath15 sublists , where @xmath16 .",
    "the quantum node searchs the sublist with cost @xmath17 and it is needed @xmath15 quantum nodes , or @xmath15 accesses to the same quantum node , to search the entire list .",
    "therefore the cost of this semi - quantum approach is @xmath18    note that if @xmath19 , _ i.e. _ , if there is enough qubits to search the entire list at once , the cost is that of the grover s quantum search , namely , @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are no qubits at all , the cost reduces to the classical one , @xmath21 . finally , with @xmath0 qubits available , the cost @xmath22 is somewhere in between the classical and quantum searchs .",
    "shor@xcite discovered that doing a fourier transform quantum mechanically is exponentially faster than classically .",
    "this quantum fourier transform ( @xmath23 ) is the kernel of his algorithm to factorize numbers , with the notorious implication of possibly breaking , with polynomial cost , the most used public key cryptographic protocol , namely , the rsa@xcite , that is based on the product of any two huge prime numbers .",
    "it has to be noted that , in the shor s factorization algorithm , rather than fourier transforming an arbitrary quantum state , the @xmath23 is applied to a particular state as part of the process of factorization .",
    "therefore , this subtle application of the @xmath23 does not face two potentialy difficult problems , namely , preparing an arbitrary quantum state@xcite and measuring the complex phases@xcite of its fourier transform , which comes to be the problem we will treat here .",
    "classically , the best known algorithm to calculate the discrete fourier transform of a real function at @xmath1 points ( @xmath24 ) is the well known fast fourier transform ( @xmath25 ) , which costs @xmath26 operations .",
    "our point here is to use the @xmath23 , which costs @xmath27 quantum operations , to improve the @xmath25 algorithm .",
    "this preamble done , now the semi - quantum approach to discrete fourier transform a function is described .",
    "a real function tabulated at @xmath1 points can be substituted by its interpolating polynomial @xmath28 which can be represented by the real vector @xmath29 whose fourier transform is the complex vector @xmath30 where @xmath31 the @xmath32 are the @xmath1 complex roots of the unity .",
    "the quantum version of the @xmath33 is as follows .",
    "given the real vector @xmath34 , prepare the associated quantum state @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a normalization factor and @xmath37 is an orthonormal basis .",
    "the @xmath33 of @xmath34 is the vector @xmath38 , whose associated quantum state , written in the same basis as @xmath39 , is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a normalization factor .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are related by the unitary operator @xmath44 , @xmath45 the action of @xmath44 on the basis states is @xmath46    the @xmath25 algorithm is based on the observation that squaring the @xmath1 complex roots of the unity @xmath47 produces just @xmath48 distinct complex numbers @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath33 problem reduces to a recursion of identical subproblems , with the @xmath50 evaluated as [ fig.[fig3 ] ] @xmath51+w_n^kx_o[(w_n^k)^2]\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 @xmath53     tree representing the fft algorithm . ]    now assuming a quantum computer with @xmath54 qubits , let s see how to calculate the @xmath24 @xmath55 . for the sake of clarity , the case @xmath56 is explicitly considered , but the generalization for arbitrary @xmath0 is straightforward .",
    "the normalized input state is @xmath57 and the normalized output state is @xmath58 @xmath59 where the @xmath60 and @xmath61 are real numbers .    in fig.[fig4 ] , we propose a quantum circuit for this problem .",
    "the circuit is a slight modification of the original @xmath23 one and includes an ancillary qubit , which is necessary for the proper determination of the fourier phases .",
    "quantum circuit to determine the fourier phases . ]    in tab.[tab1 ] , we show how the fourier phases can be measured .",
    "it involves four projections followed by eight measurements .",
    "then some classical operations , summarized in tab.[tab2 ] , are necessary to _ rebuild _ the phases .",
    "note that the role of the ancillary qubit is to determine the sign ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) of the real figures .",
    ".[tab1 ] measurement procedure to determine the fourier phases .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , < \" , ]     now let s see what we have gained with this semi - quantum approach to perform the @xmath24 .",
    "the classical part of the algorithm can still be represented by a tree , but now with just @xmath64 levels and the operations to be done are those summarized in tab.[tab2 ] and eq.[eq13 ] .",
    "the polynomial evaluations of eq.[eq14 ] and eq.[eq15 ] are avoided in the semi - quantum algorithm .",
    "each level of the tree [ fig.[fig3 ] ] involves @xmath21 classical operations and , therefore , the total cost is @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the quantum part of the algorithm involves @xmath66 quantum nodes , or accesses to the same quantum node , and each quantum node performs a @xmath23 , which involves @xmath67 quantum operations , resulting in a total cost of @xmath68 .",
    "the access to the quantum node also includes an arbitrary state preparation that , according to long _ et .",
    "@xcite , costs @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the total cost of the quantum part of the algorithm is ( preparation + @xmath23 : ) @xmath70 . summarizing , performing a discrete fourier transform on the semi - quantum computer costs ( state preparation + @xmath23 + classical operations : ) @xmath71 $ ] . for a fixed number of qubits ( @xmath0 constant ) , the total cost can be rewritten as ( quantum operations + classical operations : ) @xmath72 .",
    "this expression shows that @xmath21 classical operations are being substituted by @xmath21 quantum operations .",
    "therefore , this semi - quantum approach is profitable only in the case that the quantum operations are faster than the classical ones .",
    "it is reasonable to speculate that the quantum operations would be _ faster _ than the classical ones , if we remember that to determine the @xmath73 phases , we handle just @xmath74 qubits and obtain real figures with the ( _ hopefully high _ ) precision of the detectors . on the other hand , in the classical procedure",
    ", we have to handle @xmath75 bits , where @xmath76 is the number of bits necessary to represent the real figures with the desired precision .",
    "therefore , for a given precision , the quantum procedure is always exponentially smaller in space ( _ i.e. _ , number of bits or memory ) than the classical one .",
    "it is worth noticing that , ignoring the state preparation , the cost of the @xmath33 as a function of the number of qubits ( @xmath0 ) goes from the classical @xmath77 , when @xmath78 , to the quantum @xmath79 , when @xmath80 , and for an arbitrary @xmath0 , the cost is somewhere in between the both . therefore , if the complexity of the state preparation stage could be improved , the semi - quantum approach would be certainly profitable .",
    "in this paper , we have searched for evidences that told us if a semi - quantum computer , which has an architecture that includes both classical and quantum processors communicating classically , would have some advantage over a pure classical architecture .",
    "we have shown how to perform a search in a list and a fourier transform in this semi - quantum computer . in the former case",
    ", we have shown that the grover algorithm @xcite is trivially adaptable to the semi - quantum computer and has a performance ( @xmath81 ) that is always superior to the classical one ( @xmath21 ) and inferior to the pure quantum one ( @xmath20 ) . in the latter case , we have used the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) algorithm @xcite ( @xmath79 ) to improve the classical fast fourier transform algorithm ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we have shown that using a single ancillary qubit to control the qft transformation allows us to measure the fourier phases . due to the costly state preparation stage , we have concluded that what we profit in the semi - quantum approach is to save @xmath21 classical operations , that involves @xmath21 bits , in favor of @xmath21 quantum operations , that involves just n qubits .",
    "the expression we have obtained for the cost of this semi - quantum approach as a function of the number of qubits in the quantum node , namely , ( state preparation + qft + classical operations : ) @xmath71 $ ] , shows that , ignoring the state preparation stage , the cost , as the number of qubits grows , ranges from the classical @xmath77 to the quantum @xmath79 . on the other hand , the least cost one can hope for the arbitrary state preparation stage is @xmath21 and ,",
    "therefore , it will allways dominate the complexity of the semi - quantum fourier transform .",
    "finally , our results suggest that a semi - quantum computer could be an improvement over a pure classical architecture , even in the case of a small number of qubits .",
    "implementations of the two algorithms discussed in this paper on an semi - quantum computer based on optics , be quantum or classical , seems to be relatively easy and we intend to perform such experiments to test these ideas",
