    "one of the advantages of nonparametric modeling is the opportunity for specification testing of particular parametric models against general alternatives .",
    "the past three decades have witnessed many developments in such specification tests involving nonparametric and semiparametric techniques that allow for independent , short memory and long - range dependent data .",
    "recent research on the nonparametric modeling of nonstationary data opens up some new possibilities that seem relevant to applications in many fields , including nonlinear diffusion models in continuous time [ bandi and phillips ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] and cointegration models in economics and finance .    cointegration models were originally developed in a linear parametric framework that has been widely used in econometric applications .",
    "that framework was extended in park and phillips ( @xcite , @xcite ) to allow for nonlinear parametric formulations under certain restrictions on the function nonlinearity .",
    "while considerably broadening the class of allowable nonstationary models , the potential for parametric misspecification in these models is still present and is important to test in applied work .",
    "the hypothesis of linear cointegration is of particular interest in this context , given the vast empirical literature .",
    "recent papers by @xcite , wang and phillips ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and @xcite have developed asymptotic theory for nonparametric kernel regression of nonlinear nonstationary systems .",
    "this work facilitates the comparison of various parametric specifications against a more general nonparametric nonlinear alternative .",
    "such comparisons may be based on weighted sums of squared differences between the parametric and nonparametric estimates of the system or on a  kernel - based u - statistic test which usesa  smoothed version of the parametric estimator in its construction [ e.g. , @xcite , chapter 3 ] .",
    "a major obstacle in the development of such specification tests is the technical difficulty of developing a limit theory for these weighted sums which typically involve kernel functions with multiple nonstationary regressor arguments .",
    "few results are currently available , and because of this shortage , attempts to develop specification tests for nonlinear regression models with nonstationarity have been highly specific and do not involve nonparametric alternatives or kernel methods .",
    "some examples of recent work in parametric models include choi and saikonnen ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an exception is the recent work for testing linearity in autoregression and parametric time series regression by gao et  al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) who obtained a limit distribution theory for a kernel based specification test in a setting that involves martingale difference errors and random walk regressors .",
    "the present paper makes a related contribution and seeks to provide a  general theory of specification tests that is applicable for a wider class of nonstationary regressors that includes both unit root and near unit root processes .",
    "the latter are important in practical work where a unit root restriction is deemed too restrictive .",
    "the paper contributes to this emerging literature in two ways .",
    "first , we provide a limit theory for a general class of kernel - based specification tests of parametric nonlinear regression models that allows for near unit root processes driven by short memory ( linear process ) errors .",
    "this limit theory should be widely applicable to specification testing in nonlinear cointegrated systems .",
    "second , the limit theory of the specification test involves the self - intersection local time of a gaussian limit process .",
    "the result requires establishing weak convergence to this self - intersection local time process , which is of independent interest , and a feasible central limit theorem involving an empirical estimator of the intersection local time that can be used to construct the test statistic .",
    "thus , the results provide some new theories for intersection local time , weak convergence and specification test asymptotics that are relevant in applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] lays out the nonparametric and parametric models and assumptions .",
    "section [ sec3 ] gives the main results on specification test limit theory .",
    "section [ sec4 ] reports some simulation evidence on test performance .",
    "section [ sec5 ] provides the weak convergence theory for intersection local time .",
    "section [ sec6 ] gives proofs of the main theorems in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the proofs of the local time limit theory in section [ sec5 ] and some supplemental technical results in section  [ sec6 ] can be found in the supplementary material [ @xcite ] .",
    "we consider the nonlinear cointegrating regression model @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a stationary error process , and @xmath2 is a nonstationary regressor .",

    "@xmath19 is a weighted u - statistic with kernel weights that depend on standardized differentials @xmath20 of the regressor .",
    "the weights focus attention in the statistic on those components in the sum where the nonstationary regressor @xmath2 nearly intersects itself .",
    "this smoothing scheme gives prominence to product components @xmath21 in the sum where  @xmath22 and  @xmath23 may differ considerably but for which the corresponding regressor process takes similar values ( i.e. , @xmath24 for some @xmath25 ) , thereby enabling a test of  @xmath8 .",
    "the difficulty in the development of an asymptotic theory for @xmath19 stems from the presence of the kernel weights @xmath26 .",
    "the behavior of these weights depends on the self intersection properties of @xmath2 in the sample , and , as @xmath27 , this translates into the corresponding properties of the stochastic process to which a standardized version of @xmath2 converges . to establish asymptotics for @xmath19",
