    "oscillations of neutron stars can arise in strongly nonlinear phases of stellar evolution , such as during the post - bounce phase in core collapse of massive stars or during the merger of compact binary systems .",
    "linear perturbation theory is appropriate for describing the dominant properties of stellar pulsations , but neglects several interesting nonlinear effects that can modify or enrich the linear description .",
    "for instance , a nonlinear approach is required for understanding how energy transfer between various classes of modes could saturate the @xmath0- and @xmath1-mode instabilities in rotating stellar models ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , or limit the persistence of the bar - mode instability , through nonlinear coupling between @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear mode couplings also become important in the development of a @xmath4-mode instability , that was recently observed in core - collapse simulations  @xcite .",
    "another nonlinear effect relevant for pulsations in rapidly rotating stars is the mass - shedding - induced damping of pulsations  @xcite .",
    "the main nonlinear effect appearing even for mildly nonlinear pulsations is the presence of combination tones , which are nonlinear harmonics whose frequency appears as a linear combination of linear eigenfrequencies ( see  ) .",
    "the number of linear terms in the combination tones is equal to the nonlinear order of the mode coupling . in perturbation theory ,",
    "these nonlinear features can be addressed starting at bilinear order , for the coupling of two linear modes .",
    "the presence of nonlinear harmonics can lead to exchange of energy between modes or even to two - mode or three - mode resonances or parametric instabilities  @xcite . in rotating proto - neutron stars , rotational effects can increase the number of possible resonances between axisymmetric modes  @xcite .",
    "the parameter space for possible resonances or instabilities is even larger for non - axisymmetric oscillations . in this case , each @xmath5-mode is split in its @xmath6 components proportionally to the rotation rate of the star .",
    "therefore , at large rotation rates , several modes could satisfy resonance conditions  @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves emitted by neutron star pulsations are interesting sources for current detectors , but the high - frequency band will only start becoming accessible with the construction of advanced detectors , such as advanced ligo  @xcite , virgo+ and advanced virgo  @xcite .",
    "there are also plans for detectors with significantly increased sensitivity at several khz , such as the geo - hf project  @xcite , and the proposal for the dual wide - band bar detector  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear effects in neutron star pulsations could be probed with such instruments .",
    "interest in the nonlinear dynamics of stellar pulsations exists also for variable stars , such as cepheids , rr lyr@xmath7 and @xmath8 scuti stars .",
    "the modulation of the pulsation amplitude ( blazkho effect ) or other irregular oscillations , which have been observed in the velocity and light curve of these stars , could be explained by nonlinear interaction between various modes .",
    "these studies have been carried out mainly in newtonian perturbation theory by using amplitude equations ( see e.g.   and references therein ) .",
    "general relativity provides a more appropriate framework for studying compact objects , where relativistic effects , such as the dragging of the inertial frames or the dynamical role of the spacetime , can influence the spectral properties of hydrodynamical modes or introduce new features , such as @xmath9-modes  @xcite .",
    "modern high - resolution methods   ( in particular , the 3rd - order ppm scheme ) implemented in numerical relativity codes , have allowed in recent years the study of nonlinear pulsations in nonrotating and rotating stars ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the above studies included 2-d and 3-d simulations of axisymmetric modes in either the relativistic cowling approximation , the spatially conformal flatness ( cfc ) approximation or full general relativity .",
    "nonlinear relativistic radial pulsations have also been addressed with a different method in  @xcite , where the nonlinear dynamics was studied as a deviation from an equilibrium background .",
    "complementary to fully nonlinear approaches , nonlinear perturbative techniques can be very useful in weakly and mildly nonlinear regimes for understanding how a physical process is affected by nonlinear effects .",
    "in addition , the dimensional reduction of the problem by separation of variables ( when possible ) yields a much less computationally expensive approach , suitable for large parameter studies . in order to correctly address the gauge freedom of general relativity ,",
    "a relativistic perturbation theory has been introduced in  @xcite , and then extended to physical systems where two or more variables can be assumed as perturbative parameters  @xcite . for spherically symmetric and time dependent spacetimes , a gauge invariant formalism for studying",
    "spherical and nonspherical perturbations was introduced by gerlach and sengupta  @xcite .",
    "this formalism was further developed in  @xcite and then extended ( with partial gauge - invariance at second and higher perturbative orders ) in  @xcite ( from now on gsgm formalism ) .",
    "efforts are now under way for formulating a fully gauge - invariant theory at second or higher order  @xcite .",
    "second - order perturbative studies have been carried out in cosmology  @xcite , or for investigating the schwarzschild  @xcite and kerr  @xcite spacetimes . in the two - parameter relativistic perturbative framework ,",
    "the coupling between the radial and nonradial oscillations of perfect - fluid , spherically symmetric neutron stars has been recently investigated in  @xcite . in particular , the coupling between the radial and axial oscillations exhibits an interesting resonance when a radial mode frequency approaches the frequency of an axial @xmath9-mode  @xcite .    in this paper , we address the coupling between the radial and polar nonradial modes by numerically solving the perturbation equations introduced in  @xcite for polytropic , nonrotating relativistic stars . in the polar sector ,",
    "new interesting results are expected as the spectrum of polar modes is generally richer than the axial case .",
    "in particular , we set up initial conditions ( in following recent numerical simulations of core collapse  @xcite ) for studying pulsating protoneutron stars . in the post - bounce phase a newly - born neutron star is expected to mainly oscillate in its radial ( @xmath10 ) and nonradial quadrupole ( @xmath11 ) modes  @xcite with a variation in its central density of several percent . after investigating several initial pulsating configurations , we have found that for a @xmath12 variation in the central energy density and about @xmath13 energy stored in nonradial oscillations some bilinear combination tones are within the sensitivity window of advanced and newly proposed gravitational wave detectors",
    ". a possible detection of these combination tones , in addition to the linear modes , would provide new important information for solving the high - density equation of state puzzle through gravitational - wave asteroseismology . note that the perturbative equations as developed in  @xcite do not contain back - reaction terms .",
    "this issues is the subject of future work .",

    "the background spacetime is the equilibrium configuration of a perfect - fluid spherically symmetric nonrotating star , which is described by the following spacetime metric : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are obtained by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations .",
    "this system of equations is closed by an equation of state ( eos ) that characterizes the fluid properties . in this paper",
    "we consider a relativistic barotropic eos : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the pressure , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the rest mass density and the total energy density respectively , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the polytropic parameters . for a central density @xmath24 and polytropic parameters",

    "the system of perturbation equations for studying the coupling between the radial and nonradial oscillations of spherical star has been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "therefore in this paper we only report the main properties of the perturbation framework and equations . for more details see the references cited above .",
    "the study of linear perturbations of a spherically symmetric background can be significantly simplified by adopting the expansion of the perturbed quantities in scalar , vector and tensor harmonics .",
    "this technique enables us to separate in the perturbed quantities the angular dependence from the time and radial parts .",
    "this reduces the problem to just one spatial dimension .",
    "any harmonic component of the linear perturbative variables is then identified by the harmonic indices @xmath29 and is dynamically independent .",
    "a further sub - classification can be carried out on a spherically symmetric background , where two perturbation classes with opposite parity and independent dynamics can be defined , namely the axial ( _ odd - parity _ ) and the polar ( _ even - parity _ ) perturbations .",
    "the above perturbative technique can be extended to second order perturbations . however , due the hierarchical structure of the perturbation methods the nonlinear perturbations obey inhomogeneous perturbation equations , where the homogeneous part has the same differential structure as the linear perturbation equations , whereas the source terms are made by the product of linear perturbations . from the form of these quadratic terms",
    ", we can notice that the @xmath29 second order perturbations depends on self coupling terms , which couple linear perturbations with the same harmonic index @xmath30 , and mixed terms , which are instead the product of linear perturbations with different harmonic indices .    in this paper as well as in  @xcite",
    ", we select the coupling between the radial @xmath31 and nonradial @xmath32 perturbations , and concentrate on the numerical simulations of the polar perturbative class . for the coupling between the radial and axial nonradial oscillations see  @xcite . in order to study the gauge properties of the linear and nonlinear perturbations ,",
    "we have found convenient to use the 2-parameter relativistic perturbation theory  @xcite and the gauge invariant formalism of gerlach and sengupta  @xcite , in the version developed by  @xcite , that we call gsgm formalism .",
    "we have labelled the radial and nonradial perturbation with two distinct parameters and studied the gauge invariance of our nonlinear quantities .",
    "this particular coupling can then be studied by means of variables that are gauge invariant when the linear radial perturbation gauge is fixed . adopting the so - called _ radial gauge _ for the radial perturbations , the problem becomes essentially that of linear polar perturbations on a time - dependent spherical background .",
    "the remainder of this section is dedicated to the description of the main properties of the radial and nonradial perturbations and their coupling terms .",
    "we label linear radial quantities by a @xmath33 superscript , linear nonradial quantities by a @xmath34 superscript and coupling terms by a @xmath35 superscript .",
    "the radial pulsations are described by a set of four perturbative fields , namely two metric quantities  @xmath36 , @xmath37 and two fluid variables , which are the enthalpy  @xmath38 and the velocity  @xmath39 variables .",
    "they obey three first order in time evolution equations and two constraints , as there is a single radial degree of freedom .",
    "we can then solve a hyperbolic - elliptic system of equations , which is formed by two hyperbolic equations , for  @xmath39 and  @xmath38 , and the hamiltonian constraint that at any time step updates the variable  @xmath36 , while  @xmath37 is determined by the second elliptic equation .",
    "the linear polar nonradial oscillations can be studied with a set of gauge invariant quantities  @xcite , the three metric perturbations  @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and the three fluid variables  @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . among the different systems of perturbation equations that are available in the literature , we choose a system of three partial differential equations for the three variables  @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath43 .",
    "it consists of two hyperbolic equations , which describe respectively the gravitational waves and sound waves propagations , and an elliptic equation , i.e the hamiltonian constraint  @xcite .",
    "since the hamiltonian constraint is used for updating at any time step one of the unknowns of the problem , the errors associated with the violation of this constraint are corrected .",
    "the other nonradial variables @xmath42 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which are necessary for updating the source terms of the second order perturbative equations , can be obtained by three hyperbolic partial differential equations that are reported in appendix  [ sec : non - radial - eqs ] .",
