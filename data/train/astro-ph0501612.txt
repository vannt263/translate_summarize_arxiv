    "stawarz et al . ( 2003 ) considered very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray emission produced by the kpc - scale jets in nearby low - power radio galaxies of the fr i type  @xcite .",
    "optical and x - ray emission detected recently from a number of such objects indicate that these jets are still relativistic on the kpc scale , and that they contain ultrarelativistic electrons with energies up to @xmath1 tev ( see a discussion in  @xcite and references therein ) . therefore , some of the nearby fr i jets can be in principle vhe @xmath0-ray emitters due to the inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering off ambient photon fields which , at kpc distances from the active nuclei , are expected to be still relatively high .",
    "for example , following  @xcite it can be found that the bolometric energy density of the stellar emission at @xmath2 kpc from the center of a typical luminous elliptical galaxy is on average @xmath3 erg @xmath4 . in the particular case of radio galaxy m  87 ,",
    "@xcite show that comptonization of such a starlight radiation ( that dominates over the energy densities of the other photon fields in the jet comoving frame , in particular over the energy density of the synchrotron photons ) within the kpc - scale jet ( its brightest knot a ) by the synchrotron - emitting electrons in the equipartition magnetic field can possibly account for the tev emission detected by the _",
    "cherenkov telescope from the direction of that source  @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent observations of m  87 by the _ whipple",
    "_ telescope  @xcite gave only upper limits for its emission in the @xmath5 tev photon energy range , suggesting , although not strictly implying , variability of the vhe @xmath0-ray signal .",
    "such variability , clearly confirmed by the most recent _ hess _ observations  which established the presence of a variable source of vhe @xmath0-ray emission within 0.1 deg ( @xmath6 kpc ) of the m  87 central region  @xcite  questions the possibility that the kpc - scale jet is responsible for the @xmath7 detections of m  87 by _ hegra _ and _ hess _ telescopes . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limits imposed in this way put interesting constraints on the magnetic field within the m  87 large - scale jet , an issue which is of general importance in astrophysics .    here",
    "we comment on the high energy @xmath0-ray emission of the m  87 kpc - scale jet , resulting from the ic scattering on the stellar photon field .",
    "we take into account a relativistic bulk velocity of the emitting region as well as klein - nishina regime of the electron - photon interaction .",
    "we emphasize an important aspect of the presented discussion : ic scattering of the starlight emission by the synchrotron - emitting electrons is _ inevitable _ , and involves neither the unknown target photon field , nor the additional unconstrained source of the ultrarelativistic high - energy electrons .",
    "in particular , we ` reconstruct ' the electron energy distribution from the _ known _ broad - band synchrotron spectrum of a given jet region , and then estimate the ic flux for the _ known _ target photon field .",
    "therefore , our results , presented in detail in  @xcite are independent on any model of particle acceleration .",
    "detailed broad - band ( radio - to - x - ray ) observations of the m  87 large - scale jet circumscribe well the synchrotron spectrum of knot a , the brightest part of the jet in the radio and optical regimes .",
    "hereafter we refer to the analysis by  @xcite , which indicates that the energy distribution of the synchrotron - emitting electrons ( as measured in the jet commoving frame denoted by primes ) can be approximated by a broken power - law , @xmath8 with the spectral indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the electron break lorentz factor @xmath11 corresponds to the observed synchrotron break frequency @xmath12 hz for the emitting plasma magnetic field @xmath13 g and doppler factor @xmath14 . the cut - off energies @xmath15 and @xmath16 are basically unconstrained , but the synchrotron origin of the x - ray jet emission indicates @xmath17 .",
    "we normalize the number of radiating electrons to the observed ( isotropic ) synchrotron luminosity of knot a at the break frequency , @xmath18 erg s@xmath19  @xcite .      for the target starlight photons at the position of knot",
    "a we assume roughly isotropic distribution in the galactic rest frame and strongly anisotropic in the jet rest frame , due to the relativistic jet velocity .",
    "we take the characteristic observed frequency of the optical - nir bump due to the elliptical host of m  87 as @xmath20 hz  @xcite .",
    "we also evaluate the appropriate starlight energy density at the position of knot a _ directly _ from the observations of m  87 host galaxy , assuming king profile for the stellar emissivity at the distances @xmath21 from the m  87 nucleus  @xcite , @xmath22^{-3/2 } \\quad { \\rm for } \\quad r < r_{\\rm t } \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the radius as measured from the galactic center , @xmath24 is the core radius for the galaxy and @xmath25 is the appropriate tidal radius .",
    "we normalize this distribution to the observed luminosity density profile in the @xmath26 band  @xcite , with the parameters @xmath27 kpc and @xmath28 kpc .",
    "we evaluate further the @xmath26-band stellar energy density at the position of knot a as @xmath29 erg @xmath4 , which is in fact a very safe _ lower _ limit ( see a discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "we evaluate the high - energy emission of knot a due to ic scattering on monoenergetic and mono - directional ( in the jet rest frame ) starlight photon field , including properly relativistic effects in the klein - nishina regime , using the approximate expression given by  @xcite .",
    "we also consider the bulk lorentz factor of the m  87 jet at the position of knot a , @xmath30 , to be @xmath31 , and the jet viewing angle @xmath32 , @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "for such a choice of @xmath30 and @xmath32 one gets the jet doppler factor of the discussed region @xmath34^{-1 } \\sim 1 - 3 $ ] .",
    "spectral energy distribution of the high - energy @xmath0-ray ic emission of knot a is presented in figure 1 for different magnetic field intensities , jet viewing angles @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the bulk lorentz factors @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the thomson part of this emission extends up to photon energies of about @xmath39 ev .",
    "below we compare the expected ic fluxes for different photon energies to the upper limits imposed by the observations of _ egret _ observatory and ground - based cherenkov telescopes : _ hess _ , _ hegra _ and _ whipple _ , and next we compare the implied lower limits on the jet ( knot a ) magnetic field with the appropriate equipartition value , @xmath40 as given by  @xcite .",
    "note , that the adopted value of @xmath41 refers to the energy equipartition between the jet magnetic field and ultrarelativistic electrons , with possible contribution from the non - radiating particles neglected .",
    "_ egret _ observations of the virgo cluster give the photon flux @xmath42 @xmath43 s@xmath19  @xcite , which implies @xmath44 @xmath45 g corresponding roughly to @xmath46 , for any choice of the kinematic factors considered here . this constraint does not necessarily imply a departure from the magnetic field",
    " radiating particles energy equipartition but , interestingly enough , already excludes a class of models involving a very weak jet magnetic field .      _",
    "whipple _ observations give the @xmath47 cl upper limit to the vhe @xmath0-ray photon flux of m  87 radio galaxy @xmath48 @xmath43 s@xmath19  @xcite . independently on the _ egret _ constraints , the _ whipple _",
    "observations imply thus magnetic field intensity within the discussed jet region @xmath49 @xmath45 g , or in other words @xmath50 again for any choice of the kinematic factors considered here .",
    "_ hegra _ observations resulted in a @xmath51 detection of high - energy @xmath0-ray flux from the direction of m  87 with the photon flux @xmath52 @xmath43",
    "s@xmath19  @xcite .",
    "recent _ hess _ observations resulted also in the detection of the m  87 system at the @xmath7 level , however with the photon fluxes @xmath53",
    "@xmath43 s@xmath19 in 2003 , and @xmath54 @xmath43 s@xmath19 in 2004  @xcite .",
    "this clearly indicates a variability of the high - energy @xmath0-ray emission of this source , and therefore gives the _ upper limits _ for the vhe radiation of knot a.        figure 2 shows the expected photon flux of knot a at the observed photon energies @xmath55 tev as a function of the magnetic field intensity , for the jet viewing angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and the bulk lorentz factors @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the appropriate equipartition magnetic field .",
    "the most recent _ hess _ observations imply therefore the magnetic field within knot a as strong as @xmath56 @xmath45 g , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "our study indicates that the magnetic field within the brightest knot a of m  87 jet is most likely stronger than the equipartition value that refers to the radiating electrons alone , @xmath58 ( if the jet viewing angle is in the range @xmath59 and the jet bulk lorentz factors @xmath60 ) .",
    "on the other hand the upper limit of the magnetic field intensity within knot a can be found from the upper limit imposed on the magnetic field energy flux , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 erg s@xmath19 is the total power of m  87 jet  @xcite and @xmath63 pc is the radius of radio structure at the position of knot a. this gives roughly @xmath64 @xmath45 g .",
    "the comoving energy density of the magnetic field within knot a is therefore limited roughly by @xmath65 erg @xmath4 @xmath66 @xmath67 erg @xmath4 .",
    "_ vlbi _ measurements often allow one to infer magnetic field intensity from the low - frequency spectral break in the radio emission of the ( sub ) pc - scale jet modeled in terms of synchrotron self - absorption process . in the case of m  87 jet , this method gives @xmath68 g at @xmath69 pc  @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic energy flux in a jet is constant , then one should expect magnetic field intensity at the position of knot a to be roughly @xmath70 @xmath45 g , where we put @xmath71 and the jet radius at the position of the considered knot @xmath72 pc  @xcite .",
    "hence one can conclude that some kind of amplification of the jet magnetic field has to take place between the parsec and kiloparsec scales , although all the estimates presented above should be taken with caution , as some arbitrary assumptions on the jet magnetic field structure were invoked .",
    "we speculate that the suggested amplification of the jet magnetic field is due to an action of the turbulent dynamo processes discussed in this context by , e.g. ,  @xcite : the kelvin - helmholtz instabilities occurring inevitably at the edges of the jet are supposed to create large - scale eddies at the flow boundaries , which amplify the jet magnetic field and develop highly turbulent mixing layer between the jet and the surrounding medium .",
    "such turbulent shear layers play a crucial role in mass entrainment ( and so deceleration ) of the fr i outflows  @xcite , and in acceleration of the jet particles  @xcite , influencing also polarization properties of the jets  @xcite .    in a framework of this model , on the small scales",
    "the m  87 jet has to be dynamically dominated by the ( cold ) particles , in order to allow for the turbulent dynamo process to proceed at all .",
    "on the larger scales the mass entrainment process decelerates the flow gradually , slowly amplifying the jet magnetic field ( to the value exceeding at some point the energy equipartition with the radiating electrons ) , and creating a turbulent boundary layer that spreads into the jet interior .",
    "this process accomplishes at @xmath73 kpc from the active center ( knot a and beyond ) , where the jet magnetic field reaches an approximate equipartition with the energy density of the jet particles , while the jet flow itself becomes fully turbulent , disappearing into the outer amorphous radio lobe .",
