    "the pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy ( dig ) was first identified by a. wilson ( see holmberg 1958 ) and its status as a nearby dwarf was confirmed only with the detection of hi by fisher & tully ( 1975 ) . despite its small size , pegasus supports ongoing star formation as evidenced by the presence of luminous blue stars ( hoessel & mould 1982 , christian & tully 1983 , sandage 1986 ) and small hii regions ( hunter , hawley , & gallagher 1993 ) .",
    "pegasus is fairly typical of the least luminous digs detected in the local group and a few other nearby galaxy groups ( cf .",
    "karachentseva et al .",
    "1987 ; miller 1996 ) .",
    "pegasus presents an interesting structural combination of a dwarf irregular system , with a chaotic appearance due to star formation , and a relatively symmetric dwarf elliptical ( de ) or dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy , typically without young stars .",
    "pegasus has a smooth outer envelope with elliptical isophotes and a brighter core that contains at least two ob associations ( ivanov 1996 ) .",
    "it also has a relatively low amount of hi , as indicated by its moderate ( for a dig ) ratio of m@xmath5l@xmath10.4 ( hoffman et al .",
    "pegasus may therefore be a nearby example of a transition object between a dwarf galaxy dominated by current star - formation and one dominated by past star formation .    while the evolution of very low mass galaxies is still unclear",
    ", one possibility is that brief epochs of very active star formation produce a significant fraction of the stellar mass over a few dynamical time scales , or @xmath01  gyr ( e.g. babul & ferguson 1996 ) .",
    "such events could disrupt or eject a small galaxy s ism , thereby inhibiting further star formation for a time ( e.g. dekel & silk 1986 , sandage & fomalant 1993 , marlowe et al .",
    "1995 ) . under these conditions much of the metal - rich supernova ejecta will also be lost and so the remaining stellar populations are expected to be relatively metal - poor and may show little metal enrichment over time .",
    "it is interesting to see if any indications exist for epochs of enhanced star formation activity in the recent history of the pegasus dwarf , which might have led to its transitional morphological structure .",
    "this paper presents the first optical study of the stellar population of the pegasus dwarf based on observations obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "supplementary ground - based data were obtained with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "the pegasus dwarf is highly resolved into individual stars by wfpc2 .",
    "these data sets allowed us to obtain high quality color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the pegasus dwarf , which we analyze to derive its recent star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "the next section reviews the global properties of pegasus and  3 describes our new observations .",
    "our analysis of the color - magnitude diagrams is covered in subsequent sections , the derived sfh is presented in  7 , and the results are summarized in  8 .",
    "table 1 summarizes several key observables for pegasus .",
    "the b@xmath6v color of pegasus is sufficiently blue that some ongoing star formation is required .",
    "this is consistent with the cmd from an early ccd study by hoessel & mould ( 1982 ) .",
    "they noted a modest young stellar population component and suggested that `` ... recent star formation in pegasus has been very subdued . ''",
    "this point was reinforced by the discovery ( hunter , hawley , & gallagher 1993 ) that pegasus contains small , faint hii regions and some diffuse ionized gas image obtained with the wiyn telescope in august 1997 under good seeing conditions by wisconsin graduate students a. cole , j. c. howk , & n. homeier ( private communication ) suggest the second of the original hii regions is a background galaxy . these data also show that pegasus contains several previously undetected faint , compact h@xmath7 sources which could be hii regions . ]",
    "( see also aparicio & gallart 1995 , skillman , bomans , & kobulnicky 1997 ) . based on the hunter et al . observed l(@xmath8)@xmath21 @xmath9 10@xmath10 ( d/1 mpc)@xmath11 erg  s@xmath12 , we estimate that only a few late type o stars have been born in the past few myr .",
    "this leads to a rough estimate of the current star formation rate ( sfr@xmath13 ) for a salpeter initial mass function of @xmath14 or sfr@xmath15500  @xmath16  kpc@xmath17  myr@xmath12 averaged over the central region of the pegasus dwarf . for a stellar mass of @xmath18(m / l@xmath19 ) @xmath16 ,",
    "the roberts time to form the existing stars at the current sfr would be @xmath2020 gyr for the expected m / l@xmath21 1 .",
    "the low l(@xmath8 ) , lack of luminous blue stars , and b@xmath6v color indicate that the sfr@xmath13 is lower than the lifetime mean sfr for this galaxy .",
    "more recently aparicio & gallart ( 1995 ) and aparicio , gallart & bertelli ( 1997a ) made a ground - based study of pegasus based on vri photometry of resolved stars .",
    "they confirm the presence of young , evolved red stars .",
    "these are seen against an extensive background population of older stars on the red giant branch ( rgb ) , which they suggest have ages of up to about 10 gyr , and a range of possible sfhs are derived . however , cmds obtained from ground - based observations are necessarily limited in precision and depth due to image crowding .",
    "stellar images observed with wfpc2 typically 25 times smaller in angular area than those measured from the ground even in excellent seeing .",
    "wfpc2 therefore yields more precise cmds of the crowded stellar populations of galaxies , which are essential for constraining sfhs .",
    "lo , sargent , & young ( 1993 ) mapped pegasus with the very large array in the hi 21-cm line .",
    "their maps show that the hi is concentrated within the core of the optical body of the galaxy , where several distinct clumps are present .",
    "the mean hi column density is @xmath2210@xmath23  cm@xmath17 and the peak values are at least twice the mean .",
    "the peaks roughly coincide with the region occupied by blue stars . a comparison with single - dish maps by hoffman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) shows that the lo et al .",
    "vla hi maps contain most of the hi flux ; pegasus does not appear to have an extended , massive reservoir of interstellar hi gas in an outer disk or halo .",
    "spectroscopy of the brightest hii region in pegasus has been obtained by skillman , bomans , & kobulnicky ( 1997 ) .",
    "the low excitation spectrum shows strong [ o ii ] @xmath253727 emission and [ o iii ] @xmath255007 emission is not detected . using these data ,",
    "skillman et al .",
    "derive an abundance of 12@xmath26log(o / h)@xmath27.9@xmath270.10.2 ( z=0.002 or 10% solar ) ; an oxygen abundance which is close to that of the small magellanic cloud .",
    "thus pegasus appears to be surprisingly metal - rich relative to its blue luminosity . from the emission line balmer decrement skillman et al .",
    "derive an extinction of e(b@xmath6v)@xmath2 0.2 @xmath28 , which is much larger than the e(b@xmath6v)@xmath20.03 predicted by the standard galactic extinction model of burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) .",
    "reddening plays an important role in interpreting the cmds of the pegasus dwarf galaxy , and we discuss this issue in more detail in  3.3 .",
    "our wfpc2 data consist of three exposures of 600 s each in the f555w ( v ) and f814w ( i ) filters , and a set of 2@xmath9900  s and 2@xmath9 1100  s exposures in the f439w ( b ) filter .",
    "each image is offset by a few pixels plus a fractional pixel offset , or `` dithered '' ( leitherer 1995 , fruchter & hook 1996 ) with respect to each other in an attempt to compensate for the under - sampled point spread function of wfpc2 .",
    "the images in each filter were first registered to the nearest integer pixel , and then cosmic - ray cleaned and combined using techniques described by saha et al .",
    "the nominal pointing was to @xmath2923:28:33.0 , @xmath3014:44:6.0 at the wfall - fix aperture which is located approximately 8 arcsec along the diagonal running from the center of the wfpc2 field to the corner of the wf3 camera .",
    "the resulting wfpc2 v image of the heart of pegasus is shown in figure 1 with a close - up view in figure 2 .",
    "photometry was carried out on the combined images using a version of dophot ( schechter , mateo , & saha 1993 ) altered to take account special circumstances presented by under - sampled wfpc2 images , which also contain variable point spread functions ( saha et al .",
    "1996 ) . the photometry was calibrated and converted to the `` standard '' bvi system using the precepts laid out in holtzmann et al .",
    "independent analysis of the images indicate zero point uncertainties of @xmath270.05  mag in v and @xmath310.03  mag in v@xmath6i .",
    "we therefore adopted these values as our minimum photometric errors .",
    "the b - band data show larger scatter , reflecting their their lower signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the resulting color - magnitude diagrams are presented in figures  3 and 4 . for the individual wfpc2 ccds and for the combined data in figure 5 .",
    "figure 6 displays the internal photometric error distributions .",
    "the properties of these cmds are described in  4 .",
    "ccd images in the v and i filters were obtained in september 1996 with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "the field of view of the 2048@xmath92048 pixel ccd is 6.7 arcmin at a scale of 0.2 arcsec per pixel .",
    "the exposure times were 600 sec in i and 500 sec in v. conditions were clear around pegasus but deteriorating elsewhere in the sky during our observations ; we can not be sure of our photometric zero points due to the possible presence of clouds .",
    "the full width at half - maximum image sizes were @xmath30.6 arcsec .",
    "these images were processed in a standard way with iraf .",
    "transformations to standard magnitudes were approximated by matching our wfpc2 results .",
    "the wiyn telescope v - band image is shown in figure 7 .",
    "results of our dophot photometry of the wiyn images are displayed in figure 8 .",
    "the main sequence ( ms ) is more scattered and the rgb is broader in color in figure 8 than in the hst cmd in figures  4 , consistent with the expected effects from crowded ground - based images .",
    "there is also a larger population of bright red ( i@xmath021 & v@xmath6i@xmath201.5 ) stars , on the extended - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , which the wiyn data show extend beyond the radius in the pegasus dwarf covered by our wfpc2 images .",
    "a sparsely - populated `` blue plume '' of well - resolved stars is present in our cmds and is best defined in the wfpc2 v , b@xmath6v cmd in figure  3 .",
    "it consists of a ms with adjacent core helium burning ( heb ) evolved intermediate mass stars which form the ` blue loop ' .",
    "the straight , nearly vertical structure of the ms indicates that the hotter young stars in the pegasus dwarf have spectral classes of a or earlier ; at later spectral types the ms changes to a flatter slope where color varies more rapidly with luminosity ( c.f . the large magellanic cloud field observed by gallagher et al .",
    "we can obtain an idea of the recent sfh through comparisons with other nearby star - forming galaxies observed with wfpc2 , such as the magellanic clouds ( gallagher et al .",
    "1996 , holtzman et al .",
    "1997 ) , sextans a ( dohm - palmer _",
    "_ 1997a , b ) , and leo  a ( tolstoy et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these confirm that even by the standards of low surface brightness dwarf irregular galaxies , pegasus has a relatively small population of young stars .    the dominant feature of the i , v@xmath6i cmd ( figure  5 ) is the populous ` red plume ' , consisting of the rgb and a dense concentration of core helium - burning stars in the red clump ( rc ) overlying the lower rgb .",
    "in addition we see members of an extended - agb population , and this is confirmed in the larger field wiyn data ( see also aparicio , gallart , & bertelli 1997a ) .",
    "a few red supergiant ( rsg ) stars are likely present with colors of v@xmath6i@xmath31 and i@xmath021 . in the blue the rgb is spread in color and not well - measured at the depth reached by our wfpc2 data .",
    "this part of our cmd resembles the wfpc2 observations of the local group de galaxy ngc  147 ( han et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the rgb and the rc are prominent in both galaxies ( see figure  9 ) , which is surprising given their very different morphological classes .",
    "the obvious differences between the cmds of the two galaxies are the horizontal branch ( hb ) , which is seen in ngc  147 but not in the shallower pegasus wfpc2 images ; the greater color width of the rgb in ngc  147 ; the sharp rgb tip in ngc  147 ; and the presence of young stars in pegasus .",
    "the older stellar population appears to be more complex in terms of its range of ages and metallicities in ngc  147 than in pegasus , but star formation has persisted for a longer time in the smaller pegasus system .",
    "spatial density distributions of stars also provide a means to explore the sfh of galaxies .",
    "for example , it is standard practice to use ob stars as markers of recent star formation , and this philosophy can be readily extended to less luminous main sequence stars to investigate stellar age - spatial distribution correlations in galaxies .",
    "additional insights into the sfh are sometimes supplied by star clusters , whose ages can be reasonably well - determined from colors when they are less than a few gyr old ( e.g. hodge 1980 ) .",
    "unfortunately in the region of the pegasus dwarf covered by wfpc2 we find only one half of a moderately dense star cluster .",
    "possible star clusters were noted by hoessel & mould ( 1982 ) .",
    "the wfpc2 images show that the pegasus dwarf is in front of a moderately rich group of galaxies , and some of these background galaxies could have been mistaken for star clusters in ground - based images .",
    "however , the central star cluster is partially in our pc image , and has a diameter of @xmath340  pc with a moderate stellar density enhancement over the surrounding field .",
    "we attempted to make a cmd for this cluster but it is of poor quality due to crowding and otherwise indistinguishable from the surrounding field .",
    "the cluster appears to have a strong rc and rgb with no definite ms stars ; thus it is probably an intermediate age object , older than about 2  gyr . a deeper observation including the entire cluster could yield a more accurate cluster cmd and allow a better age estimate .",
    "while the connections between sfrs and star cluster formation rates remain obscure , very dense , luminous ` super star clusters ' are often produced in small galaxies during starbursts ( meurer et al .",
    "1992 , oconnell et al .",
    "these types of clusters would be denser and richer than the pegasus central star cluster .",
    "the absence of candidate super star clusters in pegasus is consistent with models where no starburst occurred during at least the past few gyr , this time scale being set by the likely minimum dynamical lifetimes for dense star clusters to dissolve ( goodwin 1997 ) .",
    "the general pattern in all nearby galaxies is for younger stars to clump into associations , although examples of young , massive stars in the field also exist ( e.g. massey 1997 ) .",
    "stellar associations drift apart with velocities of a few km  s@xmath12 , and former members will diffuse within a galactic disk ; the mixing times of stars within the disks of galaxies are typically @xmath32 1 gyr ( see  5.1 in gallagher et al .",
    "in addition , the region of a galaxy that is accessible to stars born in a disk may be bounded by the energy and angular momentum of their parent interstellar gas clouds .",
    "thus stars formed from interstellar clouds near the center of a galaxy are unlikely to have sufficient energy or angular momentum to travel very far out in a stellar disk .",
    "stellar surface density distributions derived from our wfpc2 images of the pegasus dwarf are shown in figure  10 .",
    "the stellar populations in the pegasus dwarf show the expected trend for most of the younger stars to be spatially clumped , and the older stars to be more smoothly distributed .",
    "figure  10a illustrates the surface densities of young stars located in the blue plume from the v , b@xmath6v cmd in figure  4a .",
    "these stars are in two major concentrations which resemble diffuse ob associations ( ivanov 1996 ) , and are located near the center of the optical galaxy .",
    "as shown in figure  10b , the rgb and rc stars are more symmetrically distributed about the central star - forming zone .",
    "figure 10c presents the density of extended - agb stars derived from the wiyn ccd images .",
    "we find good agreement between the surface densities of extended - agb stars measured in the wfpc2 images and from wiyn ; we therefore prefer the wide field of view wiyn images for this plot .",
    "the densest concentration of extended agb stars is found along the major axis , following approximately the same pattern as is seen in all of the other stars .",
    "exterior to this zone the distribution of extended agb stars is lumpy ; we may therefore be seeing remnants of older star forming regions or the modulation of apparent stellar densities by dust within the pegasus dwarf .",
    "the outermost regions appear as discrete clumps due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "stellar evolution tracks give the luminosity , effective temperature , and surface gravity for single stars of a given mass and chemical composition as a function of age .",
    "the tracks depend on basic astrophysical parameters , such as the initial mass , metallicity level and distribution",
    ". the properties of real stellar populations also depend on a variety of properties not explicitly included in most current stellar evolution models , such as stellar rotation rates and the presence of close binary companions .",
    "the results from numerical calculations are also sensitive to the treatment of convection in terms of the ratio of pressure scale height to convection scale and to the effect of convective core overshoot .",
    "in this paper we primarily use two sets of stellar evolution tracks at z=0.004 and z=0.001 computed by the geneva group ( charbonnel et al .",
    "1993 , schaller _",
    "1992 ) , which we compare with the tracks given by the padua group stellar evolution models ( fagotto et al .",
    "1994 ) . in order",
    "to most accurately compare the two sets of model tracks , it is necessary to work from a uniform set of equivalent evolutionary points ( eep ) .",
    "we chose to use the eep defined by schaller et al .",
    "these points are defined differently during the various phases of stellar evolution .",
    "for example , on the main - sequence , the eep represent a sequence of decreasing central hydrogen abundance .",
    "the eep must be carefully chosen so as to properly sample all of the color - magnitude space spanned by the tracks .",
    "this ensures the ability to correctly model , e.g , the `` bump '' in the rgb luminosity function , or the main - sequence `` hook '' exhibited by stars with convective cores .    in converting the padua tracks to the geneva eep , we carefully interpolated the tabulated values of _ log _",
    "l , _ log _",
    "t@xmath33 , and age at the given points to the appropriate values at the eep . along each padua track we identified the 51 geneva eep and interpolated new tracks between these points using a cubic spline .",
    "the accuracy of this process was checked by over - plotting the original and converted tracks ; the differences were found to be negligible .",
    "this allows us to properly interpolate when producing stellar population models , as discussed by tolstoy ( 1996 ) .",
    "while we do not explicitly include binary stars in our models , we do allow for a population of outlying stars to be present , which effectively account for binary star blends in our data .",
    "the two sets of stellar evolution models differ in several details , as can be seen in figure  11 where we plot the 1.5@xmath16 and 2@xmath16 stellar evolution tracks from padova ( solid lines ) and geneva ( broken lines ) .",
    "the rgb tip luminosity differs by more than 0.5 magnitude , and on the upper part of the rgb , the padova tracks are frequently several tenths of a magnitude bluer than the geneva tracks .",
    "these differences are probably due to the treatment of convective overshoot or the exact definition of the point where the helium - flash occurs and the rgb models are terminated .",
    "the agreement between the tracks is better along the ms and at the base of the rgb . _ therefore , if we used padova rather than geneva stellar evolution tracks we would find a slightly larger distance and a younger ( or more metal poor , or both ) stellar population . _",
    "the _ numbers _ of stars predicted to exist at any location off of the zero - age ms for the same sfh also differs for padova and geneva stellar evolution models .",
    "this occurs because at a given initial mass , the padova stellar models are generally more luminous and also have longer lifetimes .",
    "the initial mass function requires that the numbers of stars born per unit stellar mass will increase as stellar mass decreases . for",
    "a given sfr the padova tracks will predict more stars at each luminosity ( after the zero age ms ) than the geneva tracks .",
    "_ as a result , the sfr derived from an observed cmd will be somewhat lower for padova models than for the geneva models . _",
    "because most galaxies have complex sfhs , the many interconnected effects that determine the properties of a galactic cmd come into play .",
    "the history of a galaxy can therefore be effectively modeled using numerical ( e.g. monte carlo ) simulations , where a composite stellar population is randomly extracted from theoretical stellar evolution tracks using an assumed initial mass function ( imf ) and sfh .",
    "we follow the approach described in detail by tolstoy  ( 1996 ) , and made a number of simulated cmds for a variety of assumed sfh . each simulation then depends upon _ all _ the main parameters which determine an observed cmd , unlike the standard isochrone fitting methods previously used .",
    "monte carlo simulations were first used to simulate galactic cmds by tosi , greggio and collaborators ( e.g. tosi et al .",
    "1991 ) , and these ideas were further developed by tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) and tolstoy ( 1996 ) to allow statistical comparisons between many different cmd models and the multiple color photometric data sets .    using the techniques of tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) we created stellar population models for a variety of potentially feasible sfh using geneva stellar evolution tracks .",
    "these are comparatively well - defined for the recent history of the pegasus dwarf , but become non - unique at ages beyond about 2 gyr .",
    "we then determined the most likely sfh to match our observed cmd for the pegasus dwarf .",
    "our method allows for limitations in the data , such as the increasing scatter and rising incompleteness at fainter magnitudes , which preclude finding a unique solution for the sfh of pegasus based on our current data sets .",
    "the two main observational effects that we must incorporate into our model cmds before we can accurately compare them to observed cmds are observational errors ( plotted in figure  6 ) , and the incompleteness , or the number of stars we miss at given observed magnitude range because of crowding or noise ( cf .",
    "tolstoy  1996 ) . because our hst images are effectively uncrowded the incompleteness is very well correlated with the observational errors .",
    "this issue has been studied for sextans  a in detail by dohm - palmer et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , and we use these results in our models .",
    "the standard galactic extinction to the pegasus dwarf derived by burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) is small , e(b@xmath6v)@xmath20.03 .",
    "however , our observations show that with this extinction correction , the pegasus dwarf s ms is too red in b@xmath6v and v@xmath6i ; we could find no models with low reddening that would simultaneously fit in both colors .",
    "we made a model b@xmath6v versus v@xmath6i two color diagram , and empirically derived a possible range of reddenings ( and distances , with which it is weakly correlated ) .",
    "feasible reddening values were identified by requiring the model and observed ms to agree to within @xmath27 0.05 magnitudes in both b@xmath6v and v@xmath6i colors .",
    "this result is almost independent of our choice of abundance or recent sfh , since it depends only on the almost invariant optical colors of the upper main sequence .",
    "we also required fits at 0.2 magnitude level to the rgb tip and to the rc , while avoiding producing cmd features which are _ not _ seen , such as an extended blue loop .",
    "we thus find e(b@xmath6v)@xmath20.15@xmath34 from model fits to our wfpc2 bvi cmds .    to check the consistency of this reddening derived from the cmds we redetermined the mean galactic extinction _ towards",
    "_ pegasus by converting the galactic hi column density to an extinction . for this test we took @xmath223.7@xmath910@xmath35  cm@xmath17 derived from an hi spectrum recently taken by kalbera ( 1997 ) with the effelsberg 100-m radio telescope which has a 9  arcmin beam size .",
    "following diplas & savage ( 1994 ) , we find that e(b@xmath6v)@xmath20.08 is predicted for a standard galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the _ internal _",
    "extinction within pegasus should be low ( fitzpatrick  1995 ) unless the mean @xmath36 is severely underestimated . using the lo et al .",
    "average @xmath36 within pegasus , the internal extinction for an smc dust - to - gas ratio would be e(b@xmath6v)@xmath320.03 .",
    "from the hi data .",
    "we therefore estimate a total extinction of about e(b@xmath6v)@xmath37 0.1 from the measured @xmath36 .",
    "additional information comes from the iras 60@xmath38 m and 100@xmath38 m fresco maps of the region around pegasus . if there is a large amount of fir ( 100@xmath38 m excess ) cirrus in front of pegasus , the hi observations could under - estimate the galactic extinction .",
    "the 100@xmath38 m iras map is shown in figure  12 , where we see a small fir excess at the position of pegasus .",
    "the 100@xmath38m/60@xmath38 m ratio is consistent with the more general infrared cirrus in this field ; this is not a dust - free direction .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the extinction from the iras data can be made following the approach of laureijs , helou , & clark ( 1994 ) . for a peak 100@xmath38 brightness of 0.4 jy steradian@xmath12 averaged over the @xmath36  arcmin effective resolution of the iras map ,",
    "the predicted extinction is a@xmath390.03 mag .",
    "however , we might expect this to be an underestimate if the dust is far from the heating sources in the galactic disk , and therefore cold and radiating inefficiently in the iras 100@xmath38 band .",
    "the high 60@xmath40100@xmath38 ratio of the dust towards pegasus supports this possibility .",
    "the estimators for foreground galactic extinction toward the pegasus dwarf do not yield consistent values , and furthermore are averages over larger angular scales then the size of the wfpc2 field of view .",
    "since we are working from cmds , our data require a larger extinction than the burstein and heiles value .",
    "we therefore adopt e(b@xmath6v)@xmath20.15 for the remainder of this paper and apply this extinction to all of our data : a@xmath410.62 , a@xmath420.47 , and a@xmath43      the distance to the pegasus dig has not been independently established from well - calibrated standard candles , such as cepheid or rr lyrae variable stars .",
    "hoessel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) reported the detection of what appeared to be cepheid variable stars in pegasus from a series of ccd images taken in the thuan - gunn _ r _ band .",
    "their distance modulus was ( m - m)@xmath44 26.2 corresponding to d@xmath21.7  mpc .",
    "aparicio ( 1994 ) showed the hoessel et al .",
    "candidate cepheids to have the red colors of stars associated with the rgb .",
    "photometry from our wiyn images agrees with his conclusion ; the `` cepheids '' are some other class of red variable star and the cepheid distance is not valid .",
    "aparicio derived a revised distance modulus of ( m - m)@xmath4424.9 @xmath27 0.1 , or d@xmath2960",
    "kpc , from the location of the rgb tip following the calibration of lee , freedman , & madore ( 1993 ) , under the assumption of small extinction and that stars with ages of @xmath202  gyr dominate the rgb .",
    "our analysis suggests that a modest further reduction in distance is now required to account for increased extinction and a mix of stellar population ages as discussed below .",
    "the pegasus dwarf has also played a role in efforts to obtain distances from luminous stars .",
    "sandage ( 1986 ) used pegasus as one of his calibrators in exploring the relationship between stellar and parent galaxy luminosities .",
    "this approach was extended by rozanski & rowan - robinson ( 1994 ) who found ( m - m)@xmath4427.6 .",
    "however , the recent level of star - forming activity should be a key factor in determining the luminosity distribution of massive young stars in galaxies . because pegasus has a depressed sfr@xmath13 , it is likely that the most luminous stars method will over - estimate the distance , as is the case for pegasus .",
    "in our hst cmds for pegasus there are no unique features from which an accurate distance can be unambiguously obtained , such as a blue hb with a narrow luminosity distribution .",
    "the shape of the ms and blue loop somewhat constrain the distance to pegasus . if the distance were ( m@xmath6m)@xmath4526 ,",
    "then the mass function makes blue core heb stars hard to avoid in larger numbers at the top of blue plume than are observed .",
    "if ( m@xmath6m)@xmath4623 . then we would expect to see a change in slope of the ms as radiative cores and convective envelopes appear in lower mass ms stars .",
    "the luminosity of the rgb tip and the rc further constrain the range of possible distances to pegasus . however , because young and intermediate age stellar populations are present , the luminosity of the rgb tip can be uncertain ( lee , freedman , & madore 1993 , saha et al .",
    "rgb tip stars on the second ascent of the rgb during their agb phase can extend the observed rgb tip , and make the galaxy appear further away .",
    "the rc luminosity decreases slowly with age ( lattanzio 1991 ) , which makes it an inaccurate distance estimator by itself , although it is useful as a consistency check .",
    "therefore by reducing the distance to pegasus , we increase the age of stars in the rc . by comparison with ngc  147 ,",
    "whose distance is reliably measured by han et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from the location of the hb ( see figure  9 ) , the range of distances for the pegasus dwarf consistent with the luminosities of its rgb tip and rc are : 24.2@xmath47(m@xmath6m)@xmath4824.6 .",

    "note that in some cases we could obtain a fit for either the bv or vi cmds , but the same reddening did not fit both diagrams simultaneously . thus reddening and distance",
    "are correlated and _ observations in three or more filters are essential in cases where we must derive both a distance and reddening to a galaxy from a cmd _",

    "4.3.2 ) .    therefore we find and adopt a new distance of ( m@xmath6m)@xmath13=24.4@xmath270.2 or d@xmath2760@xmath50  kpc to pegasus .",
    "most of this change compared to the larger distance of aparicio ( 1994 ) is due to our assumption of nearly 0.3 mag more i - band extinction .",
    "our revised distance suggests that pegasus is a member of the m  31 `` family '' within the local group ( karachentsev 1996 ) .      for the initial discussion in this paper we set the metallicity of the whole stellar population in pegasus to be equal to that of the youngest stars .",
    "we are reasonably confident in our choice of the z@xmath20.001 models to represent the younger stars in pegasus over higher metallicities due to the presence of stars between the ms and rgb",
    ". these should be mainly stars in core heb , blue loop evolutionary phases , despite the absence of a well - defined `` blue loop '' morphology .",
    "this is probably a result of small number statistics , and also is consistent with the o abundance measured for the brightest hii region in pegasus .",
    "we have no data to measure the metallicities of the intermediate - age or older stars which make up the rgb .",
    "such measurements require the detection of an hb , extension of our photometry over a longer color baseline ( e.g. , into the infrared ) , use of narrower - band filters , or spectroscopy of a statistically complete sample of rgb stars .",
    "we can only say that most of the rgb stars are unlikely to be much lower in metallicity than the @xmath51 solar value we assume for young stars , or the rgb would be both narrow and blue , as in the carina dsph galaxy ( smecker - hane et al .",
    "1994 , da costa 1997 ) .",
    "this is clearly not the case in the pegasus dwarf .",
    "our sfh models therefore assume that the stellar metallicity levels have remained approximately constant at z=0.001 over most of the life of the pegasus dwarf .",
    "additional support for this assumption comes from theoretical models of dwarf galaxy evolution ( e.g. mori et al .",
    "1997 , ferrara & tolstoy 1998 , hensler , theis , & gallagher 1998 ) .",
    "these predict a rapid initial metal enrichment at the epoch of formation of the galaxy , followed by a plateau .",
    "hence the assumption of zero metallicity evolution over most of the lifetime of these small systems could be reasonable .",
    "our model for the pegasus dwarf is more metal - poor than the evolving - metallicity star formation history models presented by aparicio , gallart , & bertelli ( 1997a ) .",
    "if there is significant metallicity evolution in pegasus , such that metallicity substantially declines with increasing stellar age , then we will over - estimate the metallicity for the older stars seen on rgb and thus under - estimate their ages .",
    "having determined all the initial conditions for our models , we now turn to finding a sfh model that best matches our data .",
    "model cmds which might represent local group dwarf irregular galaxies when observed with wfpc2 on the _ hst _ have been calculated by aparicio et al .",
    "these are given in terms of @xmath52 versus v@xmath6i , and so are directly comparable to our wfpc2 observations .",
    "while the predicted cmds are similar in terms of their general appearance to the observations ( especially model a which has a constant sfr from 0.02 to 15 gyr in the past ) , there are some notable differences which indicate we can not simply adopt one of these standard sfh models ( such as constant sfr ) for the pegasus dwarf . in this and the following section we model the detailed properties of our observed cmds to derive the sfh for the pegasus dwarf .",
    "normally upper ms stars yield an accurate view of the recent sfh , at least in galaxies where such stars are plentiful ( e.g. dohm - palmer et al .",
    "1997b ) or obvious ms turnoffs are seen . however , in the pegasus dwarf the ms is barely populated for m@xmath53 - 2 , and we therefore have a poor statistical base for modeling the recent sfh .",
    "what is clear , as it was to earlier investigators , is the relative paucity of stars produced in pegasus during the past gyr .    in a constant sfr galaxy",
    "the observed density of ms stars declines rapidly with increasing luminosity due to the combination of the imf and increasing @xmath54 with decreasing @xmath55 ( see scalo 1986 , holtzman et al .",
    "1997 , massey 1997 ) .",
    "the interpretation of a galactic sfh therefore is most straightforward over the time span @xmath56 corresponding to the ms lifetimes of the _ least _ luminous observable ms stars .",
    "however , to find even these older ms stars we must take an iterative approach and subtract younger stars to reveal less luminous , older ms stars ( see dohm - palmer et al .",
    "this is necessary because younger generations will overlay the older , lower mass ms stars . in pegasus , we reach to @xmath570 on the ms , and thus to stars with ages of @xmath30.5  gyr .",
    "we used two approaches to fitting the ms , which is well isolated from other evolutionary phases by wfpc2 photometry . from the technique presented by dohm - palmer et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , we calculated the sfr from the counts in the ms luminosity function .",
    "we fit the observed luminosity function using the stellar evolution models of bertelli et al .",
    "these provide a mass - magnitude and mass - age relation for the ms at a metallicity of z=0.001 ( see  6.4 ) .",
    "we use a salpeter imf correction , and assume the distance modulus to be 24.4 .",
    "the calculations were done with the dereddened data , and a completeness correction has been applied ( see sec .",
    "the results shown in figure 13 are rather noisy due to the small number of ms stars .",
    "the sfr has been approximately constant over the past 100  myr at @xmath582000  @xmath59  myr@xmath12  kpc@xmath17 , with a minimum in the sfr occurring between 100 and 200  myr ago .",
    "we also derived a recent sfh from statistical fits to the cmd using the methods of tolstoy ( 1996 ) as described in  6.2 and  7.4 .",
    "we adopted simple estimates for the recent sfh and iterated these until satisfactory agreement was achieved between the models and younger components of the cmd .",
    "the resulting models for the ms are in figure 13 which are derived for the sfr given by the solid line in figure 15 . with this technique",
    "we attempt to fit all of the younger stars and thus do not derive a sfh based solely on the ms .",
    "while we can see evidence for fluctuations in the recent sfr over time , we do not find statistically significant sfr variations by more than about a factor of two .",
    "aparicio , gallart , & bertelli ( 1997a ) suggest that a factor of 3 spike occurred in the sfr in the pegasus dwarf about 100  myr in the past .",
    "this would show up in our data as an excess of ms stars near m@xmath602 ; this is the location where the blue ms becomes ill - defined in our data ( see upper panel of figure 9 ) .",
    "our results in figure 13 agree with those of aparicio et al .",
    "in showing a local peak in the sfr at about 100  myr , but disagree on the specifics of the evolution out to about 200 myr , and at all points we must contend with significant amounts of statistical noise .",
    "we therefore can not confirm the aparicio et al .",
    "100  myr peak in the sfr from measurements of ms stars in our wfpc2 images .",
    "a second approach to measuring sfh using stars core heb evolutionary phases was pioneered by payne - gaposchkin ( 1974 ) , who took advantage of the cepheid variable pulsation period - age relationship to trace the recent history of star formation in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "our group has also utilized blue core helium burning stars to derive sfhs from the numbers of such stars as a function of their luminosity ( dohm - palmer et al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "stars in their ` blue loop ' core heb evolutionary phases are tracers of the recent sfh because their luminosities scale as a power of the initial mass , and thus luminosity correlates with stellar age",
    ". unfortunately , since the recent sfr in the pegasus dwarf is very low and the blue core heb evolutionary phase is short - lived compared to the ms , there are only a scattering of stars in the expected location of blue core heb stars .",
    "we used two methods to model the observations of blue core heb stars in the pegasus dwarf .",
    "tolstoy ( 1996 ) presented a statistical approach to deriving a recent sfh from the properties of short - lived stars on a cmd .",
    "since intermediate and high mass stars move rapidly in a cmd during their post - ms evolutionary phases , she used star number counts in relatively large boxes to as a way to statistically compare model predictions with the observations .",
    "this approach was applied to our pegasus cmds with fits being made simultaneously to the ms , core heb , and rgb components of the cmd .",
    "we then find that the sfr in pegasus has increased by about a factor of 2 during the past @xmath580.5  gyr ( see figure  15 ) .",
    "following dohm - palmer et al .",
    "( 1997b ) we also selected candidate blue core heb stars from our data and generated a luminosity function from which we calculated the sfr . while this approach of focusing on only one evolutionary phase within a complex stellar population can yield detailed measures of the recent sfh",
    ", the low number of blue core heb stars in pegasus adds uncertainty to the results .",
    "we follow the prescription of dohm - palmer et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , using the blue heb mass - magnitude , mass - age , and lifetime relations from bertelli et al .",
    "again , we adopt a salpeter imf , deredden the data , and apply a completeness correction to the luminosity function .",
    "the results are presented in figure  14 .",
    "these are plotted in terms of the sfr per kpc@xmath61 averaged over the wfpc2 field of view .",
    "error bars reflect only the statistical uncertainties and do not include any corrections for intermediate color stars that are not in the core heb phase or are non - members of the pegasus dwarf .",
    "the small numbers of these intermediate color stars in the wf3 field ( see figures  3 and 10a ) indicates that the level of contaminating objects must be low , certainly much less than 50% of the total sample .",
    "therefore while the sfr derived in figure  14 is an upper limit , it should not substantially exaggerate the actual sfr .    the aproximate agreement between the sfrs found from the ms and blue core heb stars over the last 100  myr ( 2000 and 1350 @xmath59  myr@xmath12  kpc@xmath17 respectively ;",
    "see figure 13 ) supports our original assumption that most of the luminous stars in the pegasus dwarf located between the ms and rgb are on blue loops .",
    "this consistency also indicates that rising recent sfrs predicted by our models are likely to be a proper description , and is also roughly in agreement with the conclusions by aparicio , et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "because of the low sfr and short lifetime of the blue heb phase , we have no information from this population for time scales of less than 60 myr ; this is set for the time for intermediate mass stars to evolve from the ms to the core heb phase .",
    "however , the model in figure  13 indicates that between 0.1 and 0.4  gyr ago the sfr was roughly constant at a slightly lower level than the recent sfr . from 0.4 - 0.8  gyr before the present the sfr was very close to its current levels .",
    "a similar result is derived from the statistical fits to the observed cmds following the tolstoy - saha methodology , as shown by the solid line in figure  15 .",
    "beyond 800 myr the photometric errors blend the blue core heb stars with the rgb , and the star formation history can no longer be determined from the properties of stars that are not associated with the rgb .",
    "however , we can still find a range of feasible sfhs by statistically fitting the rgb and also requiring that we produce the correct numbers of extended - agb and rc stars .",
    "a major division in post - ms evolution occurs for stars with lifetimes of about 1 gyr and initial masses @xmath622 @xmath59 .",
    "these low mass stars have degenerate helium cores during their rgb evolution and ignite helium burning in a helium flash .",
    "this leads to the nearly constant luminosity of the tip of the _ old _ rgb , which can be a useful distance indicator ( e.g. , lee , freedman , & madore 1993 ) . following the rgb phase low mass stars form a rc or hb during core helium - burning and",
    "thereafter increase in luminosity along the agb .",
    "more massive stars can evolve on the agb beyond the rgb tip luminosity and produce an extended - agb before ceasing nuclear burning ( cf .",
    "vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) .    as a result of this rgb transition between non - degenerate and",
    "degenerate ignition of he on the rgb , the luminosity at the tip of the rgb depends upon the mix of stellar ages . during the transition to a low mass rgb with helium flash at the rgb tip , the luminosity of the tip will increase with _ decreasing _ stellar mass ( e.g. , sweigart , greggio , & renzini 1990 ) .",
    "thus for a single age stellar population , the location of the rgb tip is predicted to move towards higher luminosity and redder colors as a simple stellar population ages between about 0.5 and 1.2 gyr .",
    "_ therefore any galaxy which experienced extensive amounts of star formation during the past @xmath3 1 gyr may have a complex rgb tip .",
    "_    the rgb in pegasus displays a moderate range in color ; the change in v@xmath6i color between the location of the rc and its roughly - defined tip is only 0.50.6 magnitudes .",
    "such steeply rising rgbs are characteristic of either moderately metal - poor old stars ( e.g. , see lee et al .",
    "1993 ; their calibration suggests [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 1.5 ) or of relatively massive young stars , whose rgb tracks at a given metallicity are bluer at than those of low mass stars . that pegasus can not contain a pure",
    ", old rgb can be seen from the presence of intermediate mass ms stars , the intermediate age rc , and the lack of a sharply defined rgb tip ; old rgb stars may be present in the pegasus dwarf , but will be challenging to cleanly detect .",
    "the difficulty in distinguishing older rgb stars in a cmd can be illustrated by considering ages of stars on the upper part of the rgb for a simple constant sfr model .",
    "stellar evolution models show that the rgb lifetime at luminosities above the rc are almost independent of initial mass for @xmath63 , or for stellar nuclear burning lifetimes to the rgb tip of more than 1.5 gyr . in this case",
    "the number of stars on the upper rgb is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is defined as the initial mass of stars with lifetimes at the rgb tip of the age of the galaxy @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the most massive stars to reach the rgb tip .",
    "therefore @xmath68 approaches being proportional to the age of the galaxy in long - lived systems , and stars born , for example , in the first 4 gyr of a 14 gyr age , constant sfr galaxy will make up about 25% of @xmath68 . unless these oldest stars have an obvious signature that can not be produced by a younger stellar population component , such as an associated blue hb , they are not readily identified as unique contributors to an observed cmd .",
    "the detectability of the oldest stars also depends on the sfh and the age - metallicity relationship . if the sfr was higher when a galaxy was young , then there are more old stars , and detection is more likely .",
    "conversely , galaxies that had increasing sfrs during their youths can be difficult places in which to find older stars .",
    "for this reason we have not chosen to consider more complicated sfh models in which age and metallicity both vary . while such models can be constructed ( e.g. , aparicio , gallart , & bertelli 1997a ) and are required in some cases ( e.g. einsel et al . 1995 , han , hoessel , & gallagher 1998 ) , they are not justified in the pegasus dwarf where we have yet to find any discernible signs of an age - metallicity relationship . if we were to adopt an age - metallicity correlation , then this ad hoc assumption",
    "would almost entirely determine our derived sfh for the intermediate age and old stellar populations .",
    "measurements of the stellar age - metallicity relationship are required to overcome this important ambiguity .",
    "our wfpc2 data show an excess density of stars on the vi cmd overlaying the rgb near i@xmath224.5 ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "these stars are in core helium - burning evolutionary phases .",
    "the distribution of red , helium - burning stars depends sensitively on initial mass , amount of mass loss , and metallicity , but such stars may be classified into three main categories : intermediate mass stars at the base of the blue loop , rc stars which have experienced a helium flash at the tip of the rgb , or old , red hb stars .",
    "the latter possibility seems unlikely as the mean color of the rc region is not offset to bluer colors , as is expected for a true red horizontal branch ( cf .",
    "hb seen in ngc147 data , shown in figure  9 ) .",
    "further consideration is given to the two possibilities that either most of these stars are associated with the rc or are more massive stars which did not experience helium ignition in a degenerate core .",
    "each of these models implies a different sfh for the pegasus dwarf .",
    "one model produces most of the rc helium - burning stars by invoking an epoch of enhanced star formation about 1 gyr ago ( dashed line in figure 15 ) .",
    "stars made at this time have very short red giant lifetimes , and relatively long core - helium - burning lifetimes in the red .",
    "this model then yields a high density of red stars at the required luminosity .",
    "it also implies a strong ms turnoff associated with a relatively high amplitude burst should exist at about 1 magnitude fainter than our data , and a well - populated extended - agb .",
    "this model requires considerable fine - tuning as the transition between the rc and blue loop occurs over a very small range of mass and is very sensitive to metallicity , and we do not see many blue loop stars , which should be plentiful in what is essentially a post - burst galaxy .",
    "the second and preferred interpretation assumes that the observed excess of stars superimposed on the lower rgb are a classical post - rgb rc . in this case",
    "the rc phase lifetimes are about 85 - 70 myr for initial mass 0.92@xmath16 stars with z=0.001 ( e.g. , seidel , demarque , & weinberg 1987 ) .",
    "the lifetime on the rgb for stars at luminosities equal to or higher than the rc are constant at about 50 myr for star with initial masses of about 1.5 @xmath16 or less , and decrease as the upper mass bound for stars that undergo helium flashes at the rgb tip is reached ( e.g. , sweigart , greggio , & renzini 1990 ) .",
    "for example , in the geneva models with z=0.001 the rgb lifetime for log(l)@xmath691.8 is 52 - 53 myr for 0.9 - 1.5 @xmath16 stars and drops to 31 myr for an initial mass of 1.7 @xmath16 .",
    "thus a high ratio of rc to rgb stars would be a strong signature of enhanced star formation within the past @xmath202 gyr .",
    "our wfpc2 photometry of stars in the pegasus dwarf does not yield a straightforward determination of the ratio @xmath70 because the observational errors ( and thus also incompleteness ) are a significant factor at the luminosity of the rc .",
    "however , using models of the upper rgb , which include corrections for incompleteness , to estimate how many rgb stars are superimposed on the rc region , we estimate @xmath716000 stars , @xmath729500 stars , or @xmath730.6 .",
    "the lifetimes of these two evolutionary phases for stars with ages of @xmath202  gyr predict a ratio of 0.60 .",
    "this agreement implies that _ most _ of the stars that we now see in the rgb and rc of the pegasus dwarf were formed more than @xmath32 gyr ago .",
    "the pegasus dwarf resembles other nearby irregular galaxies , including the magellanic clouds ( e.g. mould & reid 1987 ) , in having a well - defined extended - agb ( aparicio & gallart 1995 ) .",
    "stars on the extended - agb are more luminous than the rgb tip , and often have lower effective temperatures and therefore redder colors than the rgb tip region",
    ". m. aaronson and his collaborators ( e.g. cook , aaronson , & norris 1986 ) were among the first to demonstrate that luminous agb stars are useful indicators for the presence of intermediate age stars in galaxies beyond the milky way s family .",
    "more recently gallart et al . ( 1994 , 1996 ) incorporated extended - agb stars in their investigation of the sfh of the local group ibm galaxy ngc 6822 .",
    "they emphasized the connection between the detection of bright agb stars and existence of a stellar population with ages between 1 and 10 gyr , but also noted some of the uncertainties involved with the interpretation of these types of stars .",
    "in particular the extended - agb is sensitive to stellar metallicities and mass loss rates , neither of which can be reliably determined from bvi cmds of a mixed - age stellar population where the sfh is unknown . in pegasus",
    "there are about 100 stars on the extended - agb , yielding a ratio to the number of rc stars of about 10@xmath74 .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical predictions for lifetimes of extended - agb stars produced by intermediate age stellar populations , which are only @xmath30.1% of the helium - burning lifetime .",
    "unfortunately , the true situation regarding the properties of the extended - agb may be even more complicated .",
    "guarnieri , renzini , & ortolani ( 1997 ) reviewed a variety of additional factors that may influence the populations of agb stars in galaxies , including the importance of binary systems . also ,",
    "dust in the winds of luminous agb stars affects their optical magnitudes and colors ; the cmd of luminous extended - agb stars is therefore difficult to quantitatively interpret .",
    "pegasus contains a pronounced rgb with a well - populated rc .",
    "the tip of the rgb is diffuse , as is typical in intermediate - age stellar systems .",
    "the ratios @xmath75 and @xmath76 are consistent with predictions for stellar populations which formed their stars between 2 - 6 gyr before the present .",
    "we conclude that in pegasus the structure of the ` red plume ' tells us that the bulk of stars now on the rgb formed more than 1 - 2  gyr ago .",
    "in addition , the extended - agb is too sparsely populated to agree with models in which most of the star formation occurred took place more recently than 1 - 2  gyr before the present .",
    "while an older , very metal - poor stellar population can not be excluded , it should comprise a minority of the rgb stars seen in our cmd for the pegasus dwarf .",
    "constant metallicity models are illustrated in figure  15 .",
    "these produce a relatively young age for the bulk of the stars , most of which form in these models from 2 - 4 gyr ago , when the average sfr was about ten times its current value .",
    "incorporating declining metallicity levels in older stars may be a more realistic assumption . in this class of model the structure of the rgb",
    "depends on both age and metallicity .",
    "a general feature of such models will be a more prolonged epoch of star formation . in our best estimate for this type of model",
    ", the primary star - forming epoch would extend back to about 8  gyr ago .",
    "the average sfr then is reduced by about a factor of three relative to the constant stellar metallicity model .",
    "this reflects the longer time span of active star formation , and that older stars on the rgb are more numerous due to the form of the initial mass function .    a purely bimodal model for the stellar age distributions in which a trace @xmath771 gyr age stellar component is seen in combination with a very old",
    ", low metallicity stellar population is excluded .",
    "this sfh predicts a narrow , relatively blue rgb with a sharply - defined rgb tip , that we do not see .",
    "a bimodal sfh model also fails to produce the observed populous rc that is approximately centered on top of the rgb .",
    "our ` young ' model where most of the stars in pegasus are produced during about 2 gyr reaches its maximum luminosity at the end of the main star - forming epoch , about 2 gyr before the present . estimating a current stellar mass for the pegasus dwarf of 1 - 2@xmath910@xmath78 from its integrated colors and optical luminosity ( see table 1 ) , we can then calculate the peak luminosity .",
    "stellar population evolution models , such as those of mller , fritze - v .",
    "alvensleben , & fricke ( 1997 ) , predict that after 2 gyr , with a constant sfr , @xmath791 . at maximum light our rapid astration model for pegasus",
    "would have had m@xmath414 .",
    "the color depends on the metallicity distribution of the stars , but would fall in the range of 0.1@xmath32b@xmath6v@xmath320.3 .",
    "even at its best pegasus might not have been a notable galaxy .",
    "the sfh models that we have obtained for pegasus allow the primary star - forming phase to extend for up to 8 gyr . in this case",
    "the galaxy would be about 1 magnitude fainter 2 gyr ago , and its color would be considerably redder , e.g. b@xmath6v@xmath30.4 .",
    "the only way for the pegasus dwarf to have been more luminous than a dwarf is for it to have experienced a major starburst where a significant fraction of the total stellar mass forms in @xmath30.1  gyr ( babul & ferguson 1996 ) .",
    "we have yet to find any compelling direct evidence for such an event ( e.g. , remnant populous star clusters or well - defined ms turn - offs ) , but we also can not exclude the possibility of a major starburst , especially if it occurred more than 2  gyr ago .",
    "however , the simplest model for the sfh of the pegasus dwarf galaxy assumes that stars formed at relatively constant rate over several gyr , with the main episode of star formation ending about 2  gyr before the present .",
    "the larger of the local group dsph systems are similar to pegasus in terms of size and luminosity .",
    "the galactic dsphs are well known to contain examples of purely old , metal - poor galaxies , such as the draco , sculptor , and ursa minor galaxies ( see review by gallagher & wyse 1994 ) . however , more recently evidence has been growing for recent star formation in dsphs , including the galaxies carina ( smecker - hane et al . 1994 ) and leo i ( lee et al .",
    "1993b , demers et al . 1994",
    "; see also da costa 1997 ) .",

    "the transition local group dwarf lgs3 contains hi gas and probably some intermediate ( @xmath01  gyr ) age stars , as well as more extensive old populations ( aparicio , gallart , & bertelli 1997b , mould 1997 , young & lo 1997 ) .",
    "evidently whatever physical `` clock '' sets the time scale for star formation in these small galaxies is quite variable , and does not simply depend on galaxy size or its eventual location within the local group ( e.g. , gallagher & wyse 1994 , da costa 1997 ) .",
    "the pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy is a nearby , low sfr , low mass , dwarf galaxy . our revised distance to the pegasus dwarf of 760 kpc places this galaxy in the m31 `` family '' , but at a projected distance on the sky of 400 kpc , it is unlikely to be bound to m31 .",
    "pegasus is probably a small , independent member of the local group .",
    "the established interstellar gas reserves in pegasus from the measured hi content suggest that the gas ( including cosmic he)-to - stellar mass ratio is m@xmath80m@xmath81  0.2 .",
    "pegasus lacks the raw material to substantially enlarge its stellar mass , but is not yet a stellar fossil . at the present time its sfr is low , sfr@xmath823@xmath910@xmath83yr@xmath12 , and",
    "the time scale to exhaust the gas at this rate is 13 gyr .",
    "the lifetime average sfr is several times higher , so it is possible that a return to normal sfrs could result in gas exhaustion within a few gyr .",
    "pegasus is like many other irregular galaxies where star formation is `` down but not out '' ( see hunter 1997 ) .",
    "our observed cmds for the pegasus dwarf obtained with wfpc2 in the equivalent of bvi colors show a sparsely populated ms and a complicated `` red plume '' consisting of a fairly broad rgb , a pronounced rc ( cleanly detected here for the first time ) , and an extended - agb .",
    "the extended - agb covers much of the optical galaxy on ground - based images taken with the wiyn telescope .",
    "our quantitative analysis of these cmds establishes that : ( 1 ) the reddening of e(b@xmath6v)@xmath20.15 is higher than previously thought .",
    "this mainly accounts for our reduction in distance from @xmath84960 kpc found by aparicio ( 1994 ) to d@xmath2760@xmath27100  kpc .",
    "( 2 ) star formation is ongoing at a low level and has produced at least one hii region , a blue ms , and core heb blue loop stars .",
    "( 3 ) the rgb is prominent , densely populated , and relatively blue .",
    "( 4 ) the presence of a pronounced rc , the width of the rgb , and the lack of a well - defined tip of the rgb are all indicators of a strong intermediate age stellar population component .",
    "we have quantitatively modeled the sfh for pegasus by fitting our observed cmds following the methodologies of tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) and dohm - palmer et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "the short term trend in sfr shows a modest decline in sfr during the past 0.5  gyr from the densities of ms and blue core heb stars as functions of luminosity .",
    "the pegasus dwarf therefore shows a slowly varying recent mean sfr , but nothing that would qualify as a recent star burst .",
    "our data are not sufficiently deep to yield a unique description of the sfh over more than @xmath31  gyr .",
    "instead we find a spectrum of possible models for the long term sfh of the pegasus dwarf . at one extreme",
    "is a rapid evolution model that makes most of the stars between 2 and 4 gyr before the present and assumes constant metallicity at z@xmath20.001 . at the other extreme",
    "are less well - defined models where metallicity declines in older stars ; these models have lower sfrs spread over longer time intervals , extending perhaps to 10 gyr in the past .",
    "the historical optical characteristics of pegasus depend on its sfh .",
    "however , for models where the sfr has been roughly constant at intermediate ages of a few gyr , it would have been most luminous ( m@xmath8514 ) and relatively blue when its sfr began its recent decline about 2 gyr ago . even at its peak pegasus",
    "was most likely a `` dwarf '' in terms of absolute magnitude .",
    "a galaxy like pegasus in our most actively star - forming model would be brightest at a lookback time of @xmath32  gyr , or a redshift of @xmath860.2 . at this distance",
    "a pegasus - like actively star - forming dwarf would have v@xmath5826 , blue colors , and an angular size of @xmath00.5 arcsec .",
    "thus this type of object could resemble some of the low redshift , faint blue galaxies ( e.g. odewahn et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "if the pegasus dwarf were to lose its gas supply , it might structurally resemble a spheroidal dwarf galaxy .",
    "lo et al . (",
    "1993 ) show the hi velocity field in pegasus to be fairly chaotic .",
    "they place an upper limit of 5 km  s@xmath12 on gas rotation ; measure a local velocity dispersion of about 5 km  s@xmath12 ; and a global dispersion of 9 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , stars formed from gas with these random velocities would likely retain a velocity dispersion similar to that found in the most luminous of the galactic dsph galaxies ( e.g. , gallagher & wyse 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , the global rotation is sufficiently slow that the ratio of the stellar velocity dispersion to rotation velocity also is likely to be greater than 1 , and so the older stellar body of the pegasus dwarf probably has a spheroidal rather than thin disk structure , and resembles a low luminosity de or dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "measurements of stellar kinematics would test this possibility , and could be done through observations of the relatively bright extended - agb stars in the pegasus dwarf .",
    "stellar photometry at the level of the hb will similarly enhance our ability to constrain the long term sfh of the pegasus dwarf .",
    "the blue hb that is seen in and i ( da costa et al . 1996 ) and ngc  147 ( han et al . 1997 ) demonstrate the existence of old , metal - poor stellar populations , while also yielding reliable distances .",
    "evidently these two spheroidal galaxies made most of their stars over a time span of several gyr centered at about 8 - 10  gyr before the present . in comparing the pegasus dwarf to these galaxies",
    "we need to establish the importance of its very old ( @xmath208  gyr ) , metal - poor stellar population component , which define the level of star forming activity during the primary epoch of giant galaxy formation . by way of contrast , in the lmc such stars are rare ( olszewski , suntzeff , & mateo 1996 ) , and we would like to know if this is a general distinction between the irregular and spheroidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "this information is essential in charting possible relationships between present - epoch dwarf galaxies , and faint blue galaxies seen at moderate - to - high redshifts corresponding to lookback times exceeding several gyr .",
    "the improvements in the quantitative analysis of stellar populations in nearby galaxies made possible by wfpc2 on the _ hst _ prove that despite its small mass , the pegasus dwarf has had an extended evolutionary history ; this galaxy has likely supported star formation for at least 3  gyr .",
    "the attractive idea that very small galaxies should experience a single primary and possibly cataclysmic episode of star formation during their lifetimes does not appear to hold in the pegasus dwarf or many other low mass local group galaxies .",
    "we are then left with the intriguing problems of understanding what physical mechanisms allow some small galaxies to produce their stars slowly and without violence , and how this relates to the variety of stellar age mixes and gas contents found in extreme dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe .",
