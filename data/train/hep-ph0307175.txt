    "the value of @xmath106 is mainly constrained by the measurement of the invariant - mass distribution for @xmath0 events .",
    "expected statistical error on @xmath108 is slightly bigger , between 0.01 and 0.02 , and comes mainly from the measurement of the invariant - mass distribution for @xmath5 events .",
    "an opportunity of measuring of the higgs - boson properties at the the photon collider at tesla has been studied in detail for masses between 180 and 350  gev , using realistic luminosity spectra and detector simulation .",
    "we found that from the combined measurement of the invariant - mass distributions in the @xmath5 and @xmath0 decay - channels , the parameters of the sm - like two higgs doublet model can be precisely determined .",
    "for both light and heavy scalar higgs boson , a statistical precision in the determination of its coupling ( @xmath34 ) is of the order of 10% already after one year of photon collider running . in case of the two higgs doublet model with a cp violation",
    ", the @xmath8 mixing angle can be determined with statistical precision of 20 to 90  mrad ( in a small - mixing approximation ) .",
    "we also considered the combined measurement of the various angular correlations in the @xmath0 and @xmath1-decay products . for a simple generic model , with sm - couplings to fermions",
    ", the parameters describing a cp violation in the higgs couplings to vector bosons can be determined to about 10% .",
    "if in addition the invariant - mass distribution is used to constrain model parameters , 12 % statistical uncertainty in the determination of the higgs - boson couplings can be achieved .",
