    "in the past decades , lbm has been widely used to simulate fluid flow problems @xcite , including complex turbulent fluid flows @xcite and multiscale modeling@xcite .",
    "this method is based on the boltzmann kinetic equation which is used to describe a number of interacting populations of particles . as described in @xcite ,  the lbe could potentially play a twofold function - as a telescope for the atomistic scale and a microscope for the macroscopic scale \" . in @xcite",
    "dense fluids flow past and through a carbon nano tube ( cnt ) was studied by a hybrid model coupling lbm and mds .",
    "the authors pointed out that replacing the finite volume solver by a lbm aims to take advantage of the mesoscopic modeling inherent in lb simulations .",
    "thus lbm is a mesoscopic method in nature is a widely - accepted understanding in the literature .",
    "the macroscopic parameters such as fluid density , velocity and pressure can be obtained via some averages of the mesoscopic variable which conform the basic conservation laws of mass and momentum @xcite . in practical applications of lbm to simulate a macroscopic problem ,",
    "a crucial problem is confronted , that is , a reasonable initial meso - field must be specified to start the evolution process .",
    "the first initializing method was proposed in @xcite in 1993 . recently",
    ", several methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy of numerical results and reduce the initial layers ( oscillation layers ) @xcite .",
    "such oscillations have a numerical origin and are due to the artificial compressibility of lbm . here ,  initial layer \" refers to such a computational stage within which the macroscopic parameters are oscillating . when the initial data is not well - prepared , there is an initial layer during which the solution adapts itself to match the profile dictated by the environment . for the lbm ,",
    "the existence of the initial layers is a common phenomenon @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will derive the lifting relations between the macroscopic variables and the mesoscopic variables in lbm by two ways . according to the authors knowledge ,",
    "the proposed lifting relations in this paper are different from those in the existing literature @xcite .",
    "the proposed relations will offer us some new views about the reconstruction of nonequilibrium distribution functions in lbm .    challenging multiscale phenomena or processes are widely existed in material science , chemical engineering process , energy and power engineering , and other engineering fields . generally speaking , for a multiscale problem",
    ", we often must use different methods to numerically model the processes at different geometric sub - regions and exchange solution information at interface @xcite .",
    "such coupling computations are widely adopted in the present - day multiscale simulation . as indicated above lbm",
    "is a kind of mesoscopic methods , which is a candidate to implement the meso - macro or micro - meso coupling computations in engineering applications @xcite .",
    "so , the proposed method not only can be used to obtain a better initial field for lbm , but also can be adopted in the multi - scale computation .",
    "for example in @xcite the possibility of coupling lbm with molecular dynamics simulation ( mds ) was investigated and found that with proper time and geometric scales the two numerical methods can be coupled . and in @xcite such coupling simulation was conducted . in the existing literatures",
    "the coupling of finite difference method ( fdm , which is a macrosopic method ) with lbm was adopted in @xcite , but the proposed coupling method is similar to a multigrid method and a simple regularization formula is used in their computations .",
    "the regularization formula in @xcite only considers the first - order approximation of the single particle distribution function and the coupling formula in @xcite is only used to deal with the one - dimensional reaction - diffusion system . in @xcite the coupling between lbm and mds was implemented by exchange of velocity and velocity gradient at the interface region . in this paper , the proposed meso - macro ( or micro - meso )",
    "coupling is expected to be used for domain decomposition methods , in which lbm and macro - type numerical method ( or micro - type numerical method and lbm ) are adopted in different sub - domain and information is exchanged at the interface .",
    "we believe that our proposed relation is more useful method for engineering multiscale computations .",
    "in addition , the proposed coupling method can also be used to carry out the multigrid computations and equation - free multiscale ( efm ) computations @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that lbm is very powerfull for the parallel computing on a low cost @xcite .",
    "so , the proposed relation can be used in the parallel simulations for multiscale simulations of complex fluid flows based on the refinement strategies .",
    "to the authors understanding the glossary `` lifting relation '' means that macroscopic variables in a lower degree - of - freedom ( dof ) system are upscaled to meso / microscopic variables in a higher dof system .",
    "generally , it is difficult to establish the one - to - one map from a lower dof system to a higher dof system , although the lower dof system can be seemed to be an approximate or approaching form of a higher dof system in some referred scales .",
    "this situation happens when numerical results of different scales are coupled at the same location . for example when mds and continuum method are coupled , reference @xcite indicated that it is straightforward to obtain the continuum quantities ( such as velocity , pressure ) from the particle description by averaging over the local region and over time , but the reverse problem , generating meso / microscopic particle configuration from known macroscopic quantities is non - trivial and must necessarily be non - unique .",
    "the glossary `` lifting relation '' in the title of this paper is proposed based on the concept of the dof of the governing equations .    in this paper",
    ", we will give two methods to establish the relations between variables of the navier - stokes equations and variables of lbm .",
    "numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed methods of computing non - equilibrium distribution functions are effective and accurate .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follow . in section [ lbh ] , the details of multi - scale derivation of non - equilibrium distribution functions",
    "is given . in section",
    "[ is ] , the non - equilibrium distribution functions are obtained by boltzmann - bgk equations . in section",
    "[ nt ] , the performances of the proposed relations to reconstruct non - equilibrium distribution functions are demonstrated by numerical tests .",
    "finally , some conclusions are given .",
    "in this section , we will review lbm and the corresponding macroscopic equation .",
    "based on this review , we will derive a relation for lifting macroscopic variables to microscopic variables by multiscale approach .",
    "we now introduce the lattice boltzmann - bgk model as a solver for the weakly - compressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "lbm is built up from the lattice gas cellular automata models @xcite .",
    "the numerical scheme of lbm is established based on a finite discrete - velocity model of the boltzmann - bgk equation and can be expressed as follows @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the single - particle distribution function along the direction @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath2 is the element of the discrete velocity set @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the collision operator which is non - dimensional .",
    "the macroscopic variables , the density @xmath6 and the velocity @xmath7 , are defined locally by the distribution functions as follows @xmath8 @xmath9 for the standard lbm , the collision operator is defined by the so - called bgk collision @xmath10.\\ ] ] for the convenience of comparison , from here , we use the similar notations in @xcite .",

    ", we mainly focus on the standard lbm . by the chapman - enskog expansion , under the small @xmath29 number restriction ( @xmath30",
    ", we can recover the navier - stokes equations as follows @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 it is clear that the recovered navier - stokes equations are weakly compressible @xcite .",
    "so , the density is coupled with the pressure field in lbm . in eq .",
    "( [ moment ] ) , the second term of r.h.s can be rewritten as @xmath35 and the corresponding third - order term @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 the fluid viscosity @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ viscosity ] ) , the third term of r.h.s will vanish for a divergence - free field .",
    "but the second term will not vanish , if the density @xmath6 is nonhomogeneous in the spatial domain .",
    "the navier - stokes equations are recovered by lbm under the low mach condition .",
    "physically , lbm is a weakly compressible model for solving navier - stokes equations .    at this point",
    ", we describe two situations where the lifting relation is useful .",
    "the first situation is using the lifting relation to get a good initial field of the density distribution function from specified velocity and pressure fields . as indicated above the recovered navier - stokes equations",
    "are weakly compressible , hence pressure field is coupled with the density field by the equation of state ( @xmath42 ) . in engineering computations ,",
    "the weakly - compressible flow is often used as an approximation of the incompressible flow . for the lifting function",
    ", the consideration should be made from the weakly compressible side .",
    "the non - homogeneous character of the initial density is very significant for an initial routine of lbm in the proposed lift relation .",
    "this significance can be observed from the follow - up derivations . for the initial processes ,",
    "if the initial pressure field is given , the lifting relation can be used to obtain the initial distribution functions consistent with the recovered navier - stokes equations . in another development when we couple lbm with other macroscopic solver of navier - stokes equations , we need to pass the macroscopic variables ( pressure and velocity fields ) to an approximate single particle distribution functions or the non - equilibrium distribution functions . at this time , a macroscopic equation relating to the given velocity and pressure to the particle distribution function of lbm become very useful .",
    "the major goal of the present paper is to derive such a lift relation , or a reconstruction operator as depicted in @xcite .    for the convenience of deriving such an equation ,",
    "some changes are made for the form of eq .",
