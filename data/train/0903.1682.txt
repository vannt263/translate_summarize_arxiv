    "the orbital degeneracy in _",
    "d_-shell transition metal oxides underpins many of the fascinating phenomena found in these materials .",
    "well - known examples include ferroelectricity , colossal magnetoresistance , and charge ordering @xcite .",
    "an early attempt to model the directional nature of the orbital states in the case of a two - fold degeneracy was made by kugel and khomskii @xcite , who introduced a simplified model @xmath0 the _ quantum compass model _ ( qcm ) @xmath0 where the orbital degrees of freedom are represented by ( pseudo)spin-1/2 operators and coupled anisotropically in such a way as to mimic the competition between orbital orderings in different directions . for example , on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice , the coupling between spin components on neighboring lattice sites is tied to the direction of the corresponding bonds , with ising - like interactions @xmath1 and @xmath2 along the @xmath3- and @xmath4-axes of the lattice .",
    "much interest has focused on possible `` order - from - disorder '' phenomena in this model .",
    "while the competition between spin interactions produce a massively degenerate ground state at the classical level , the degeneracy gets lifted by thermal or quantum effects , favoring a directional ordering of spin fluctuations at low temperatures @xcite . added interest in the 2d model has been spurred by the proposal that it describes the physics of a collectively generated  protected qubit ",
    ", with a superconducting josephson junction array as a possible realization @xcite .",
    "also , the model has been shown to be dual to the xu - moore plaquette model of @xmath5 superconducting arrays @xcite , and more recently , to kitaev s toric code model in a transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the degeneracies in the energy spectrum of the quantum compass and related orbital models make numerical simulations very demanding . in the absence of exact solutions in two or higher dimensions , progress in mapping out the phase diagram of the model",
    "is coming only slowly and piecewise .",
    "there is strong evidence for the existence of a symmetry - broken ground state in 2d @xcite , however , the character of the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) into this state has been a controversial issue .",
    "a continuous second - order transition is favored in one study @xcite , with others supporting a first - order transition @xcite .",
    "recently brzezicki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a one - dimensional ( 1d ) version of the quantum compass model , with the aim of analytically exploring how the interplay between quantum fluctuations and competing spin interactions produces a qpt .",
    "while the 1d model may not directly bear upon the physics of its higher - dimensional relative , it still serves as an interesting counterpoint . by a clever construction , where pairs of spin operators on neighboring sites are alternatingly mapped onto terms in a quantum ising model ( qim ) , brzezicki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained an exact solution for the ground state energy , revealing that the 1d model exhibits a first - order transition between two disordered phases with opposite signs of certain local spin correlators .",
    "intriguingly , this first - order transition was found to be accompanied by a diverging correlation length for spin correlations on one sublattice .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the method of brzezicki _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to study an extended version of the 1d qcm , obtained by introducing one more tunable parameter .",
    "the expanded parameter space allows us to uncover the true character of the qpt identified in ref . .",
    "as follows from our analysis , this transition in fact occurs at a _",
    "multicritcal point _ where a line of first - order transitions meets with a line of second - order transitions .",
    "the second - order critical points are ising - like and separate locally ordered ground states from disordered states ( with ordered quasi - local correlations ) .",
    "in contrast , when going through one of the first - order transitions , the only noticeable change in the character of the ground state is that pair correlations of spins on every second bond flip sign . in an effort to probe the anatomy of the various ground states",
    "we have analytically calculated the concurrence for pairs of spins , and also the block entanglement entropy .",
    "the concurrence signals the second - order qpts , and the block entropy shows that they are ising - like .",
    "none of these entanglement measures is affected by the first - order transitions .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) reduces to what ref",

    "the large ground state degeneracy can thus be easily understood as a consequence of the model ( [ compasshamiltonian2 ] ) being at the level crossings of the first - order qpt of the extended 1d qcm  ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "given the exact solution of the 1d qcm , we have a rare opportunity to analytically probe for the entanglement in the ground state of a highly complex system of coupled qubits .",
    "we here focus on two of the most frequently used entanglement measures : _ concurrence _ and _ block entanglement entropy _ @xcite .",
    "the concurrence of two spins at sites @xmath132 and @xmath133 is obtained from their reduced density matrix @xmath134 , which can be expanded as  @xcite @xmath135 where @xmath136 , with @xmath137 .",
    "note that the ground state expectation values of @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( and @xmath142 ) are zero , since these operators flip only one spin on an odd bond , giving a state in a different subspace than the ground state .",
    "the correlation function @xmath143 must also be zero , since the matrix @xmath144 is imaginary and @xmath134 must be real as the hamiltonian is real .",
    "therefore , the reduced density matrix ( [ rdm2 ] ) becomes @xmath145    the concurrence @xmath146 is now given by  @xcite @xmath147 , where @xmath148 are the non - negative real eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix @xmath149 .",
    "in this expression , @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the complex conjugate of @xmath134 in the given basis . here , the eigenvalues @xmath152 of @xmath153 are ( without ordering ) @xmath154 it is immediately clear that the concurrence of two spins that are not on the same odd bond is zero , since then @xmath155 which gives @xmath156 and @xmath157 . for two spins that are on the same odd bond @xmath158 ,",
    "we have that @xmath159 . when @xmath67 , the ground state is in the subspace @xmath45=@xmath160 , so then @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "we also have that @xmath163 , since the matrix @xmath164 is the same as @xmath165 in the subspace @xmath45=@xmath160 .",
    "then @xmath166 , since @xmath167 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath62 , the ground state is in the subspace @xmath45=@xmath64 , where @xmath159 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169",
    ". also , in the subspace @xmath45=@xmath64 the matrix @xmath164 is the same as @xmath170 , so that now @xmath171 .",
    "we then get the result that @xmath172 .",
    "thus , for all values of @xmath24 , the only pairs of spins with non - zero concurrence are those on the same odd bond , and for them @xmath173 .",
    "the pairwise concurrence therefore only depends on the parameter @xmath72 , which plays the role of the magnetic field in the qim ( [ hamiltonian_tau ] ) . from the well - known solution @xcite of the 1d qim",
    ", it follows that in the thermodynamic limit the concurrence has a diverging first derivative across the curve @xmath174 of the second - order qpt .",
    "note that the first - order qpt at @xmath75 is not signaled by the pairwise concurrence .",
    "in particular , this means that when going through the multicritical point , the concurrence will behave as if it was a pure second - order transition , despite the transition actually being of first order .",
    "the block entropy is the von neumann entropy of a subsystem consisting of an entire block of adjacent spins , thus giving a measure of the amount of entanglement between the block and the rest of the system @xcite .",
    "we will now show that a block of an even number of @xmath175 spins in the 1d qcm  ( [ ham ] ) that fully covers an integer number of odd bonds will have the same block entanglement as half the number of @xmath176 spins in the corresponding qim ( [ hamiltonian_tau ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the case when @xmath177 .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath178 for a block of @xmath179 spins @xmath180 , where @xmath179 is even and @xmath181 and @xmath182 are on the same odd bond , can be expanded as @xcite @xmath183 where @xmath184 are summed over @xmath185 . for the expectation value @xmath186 not to be zero , the only allowed pairs of @xmath175 operators on every odd bond in the summation are @xmath187 thus the reduced density matrix ( [ reddensl ] ) becomes @xmath188 where @xmath189 are summed over @xmath185 .",
    "this is precisely the reduced density matrix of @xmath190 spins in the qim .",
    "the block entropy @xmath191 is then the same as the block entropy of @xmath190 spins in the qim with effective transverse field equal to @xmath192 .",
    "this will apply equally well also when @xmath193 .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath194 is therefore in the ising universality class , since this is uniquely determined by the scaling of the block entropy at criticality @xcite .",
    "the first - order qpt at @xmath8 and with @xmath195 , corresponds to a non - critical qim , with saturated block entropy @xmath191 when @xmath196",
    ". its value will be the same whether @xmath197 or @xmath198 .",
    "to summarize , we have performed an exact analytical study of the 1d quantum compass model , using a mapping to the quantum ising model , following the approach in ref . .",
    "we identify four distinct ground state phases , separated by two intersecting transition lines .",
    "one of these defines a line of second - order ising - like transitions , while the other is a line of first - order transitions ( cf .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ) .",
    "the point of intersection , where the first - order quantum phase transition identified by brzezicki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite takes place , thus defines a _",
    "multicritical point_. this explains the apparently exotic behavior at the transition found by these authors . in particular , the appearance of a diverging correlation length for certain spin correlations finds a natural explanation once the multicriticality of the transition point has been recognized .",
    "one may ask whether the quantum phase transition in the 2d quantum compass model maybe also plays out at a multicritical point , in analogy to the 1d model ?",
    "if so , this could possibly explain the notorious difficulty in identifying the character of the transition , as evidenced by the conflicting results in ref . and refs . .",
    "our results for the entanglement show that the only effect on the ground state when going through the first - order transitions is that a correlation function for neighboring spins on odd bonds changes sign , without any effect on the entanglement measures studied .",
