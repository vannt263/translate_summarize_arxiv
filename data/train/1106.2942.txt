    "modern astronomy has revealed that the mass of a super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) in a galactic center has tight correlation with the mass of the bulge of the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating the co - evolution between smbhs and galaxies . according to theoretical predictions , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) may play a key role in regulating both mass accretion and star formation by their feedback through powerful outflows and/or radiation to the surrounding gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "broadband x - ray observations of agns are particularly important to study the physics of accretion and outflow in the central engine by measuring the spectra and time variability of the continuum emission from the innermost disk and relativistic jets .",
    "they also provide unique information on the structure of the tori surrounding the accretion disk , which may be the source of mass accretion and site of nuclear starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a remarkable finding is the discovery of `` new type '' agns that exhibit a very small amount of scattering gas , which are interpreted to have geometrically very thick tori , unlike classical type agns @xcite .",
    "radio galaxies , a class of agns exhibiting powerful jets , are key objects to understand the origin and effects of the agn feedback to the surroundings .",

    "the equivalent width of the iron - k line with respect to the reflection continuum is 1.13@xmath640.24 kev , which is physically self - consistent according to theoretical calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the smaller column density for the reflected component ( @xmath65 @xmath7 ) than that for the transmitted one ( @xmath10@xmath66 @xmath7 ) suggests that we are looking at the source with a somewhat face - on geometry so that a significant fraction of the reflected light from the inner wall of the torus can reach us without strong obscuration .",
    "while we detect a very strong reflection within the _ suzaku _ spectra corresponding to @xmath67 , which dominates the hxd / pin flux , we find a lower value of @xmath68 when normalized to the flux of the transmitted component determined by _ swift_/bat .",
    "this can be explained by time variability since the flux during the _ suzaku _ observation was about 3 times smaller than the averaged flux over the 58 months of the bat observations .",
    "in fact , the difference between the unabsorbed nuclear flux in the 0.2510 kev band was @xmath69 erg @xmath7 s@xmath18 at the _ chandra _ observation in 2002 , while that measured with _ suzaku _ is @xmath70 erg @xmath7 s@xmath18 .",
    "the best fit temperature of the * apec * component is @xmath71 kev , consistent with the _ chandra _ result @xcite , @xmath72 kev .",
    "we note , however , that its flux as determined with _ suzaku _ , @xmath73 erg @xmath7 s@xmath18 in the 0.2510 kev band , is about 5 times higher than that estimated from the _ chandra _ data , even taking into account the contribution from the hot ism in an outer region at radii larger than 7``.5 up to 60 '' from the nucleus ( see @xcite section 3.1 ) , which is contained in the _ suzaku _ extraction region .",
    "we find that this discrepancy is mainly produced due to the spectral coupling with the unabsorbed soft component ; its slope is assumed to be the same as for the direct component in our spectral model , @xmath74 , which is smaller than that adopted by @xcite , @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the difference may be regarded as a systematic uncertainty in the absolute flux from the hot ism , whose core emission is difficult to spatially resolve even with _",
    "chandra _ from the agn component .",

    "the obtained temperature and luminosity of the * apec * component are in the typical range of hot ism detected from elliptical galaxies @xcite and hence supports this interpretation of its origin , although we can not rule out the possibility that a part of this emission may come from photoioinized plasma irradiated by the agn , which should be regarded as an accompanying component of the scattered emission .",
    "nevertheless , since the amplitude of the scattered fraction is mainly determined from the spectrum in 12 kev band , where no strong emission lines are present , its intensity is not strongly affected by the uncertainty in the nature of the line emitting component .    since ic  5063 exhibits significant time variability during the _ suzaku _ observation , we check time variability of the spectra by dividing the time region into two states with different flux levels , epoch i ( for 57.6 ks from the beginning ) and epoch  ii ( after that ) .",
    "we adopt the model b + * apec * model for each spectrum . assuming that the reflection component and thin thermal emission were not variable on this short time scale , since they most probably originate from the torus and host galaxy , respectively , we fix the spectral parameters of these components ( and its absorption ) at the best - fit values determined by the time - averaged _ suzaku _ ( and _ swift_/bat ) spectra .",

    "the normalization ratio of the direct component between the bat and _ suzaku _ spectra is consistent with that obtained from the analytic model .",
    "as discussed in the previous subsections , the data indeed favor an inclination angle that is only slightly larger than the torus opening angle , particularly for 3c  403 .",
    "a similar numerical torus model by @xcite ( mytorus in xspec ) also gives a good fit for both targets , where a slightly different torus geometry is assumed with a fixed opening angle of @xmath153 . by adopting it instead of the ikeda model in the same way ,",

    "with _ suzaku _ , we have for the first time obtained simultaneous broad band x - ray spectra from two nlrgs , 3c 403 and ic 5063 , with ccd energy resolution below 10 kev .",
    "combined with the _ swift_/bat spectra averaged for 58 months , we are able to best constrain the spectral properties over the 0.5200 kev band .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of 3c 403 and ic 5063 are estimated as @xmath160  erg  s@xmath18 and @xmath161  erg  s@xmath18 from the infrared and x - ray luminosities @xcite , corresponding to the eddington fractions of approximately 0.06 , using the black hole masses estimated by @xcite .",
    "these eddington fractions are in the range observed for radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for seyfert galaxies @xcite in the local universe .",
    "our targets thus significantly increase the nlrg sample with similar eddington fractions studied with _",
    "suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat in addition to ngc  612 , which has @xmath162 = 0.02 and @xmath163 = @xmath164  erg  s@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "while _ suzaku _ provide us with unique spectroscopic data , the integrated spectra from radio galaxies inevitably contain the contribution from various components besides the nucleus , such as the hot ism , the radio lobes / wings , and the kpc - scale jets , due to the limited spatial resolution .",
    "the thermal emission is important only in the softest energy band in the _ suzaku _ data . in the case of 3c  403 ,",
    "we are able to separate those from the radio lobes / wings and kpc - jets , utilizing the _ chandra _ results @xcite",
    ". we find that the relative fluxes of these components are 1.0% and 0.7% of the unabsorbed nucleus emission at 5 kev , respectively , and thus make only minor contribution in the hard x - ray spectra .",
    "although we can not do the same analysis for ic  5063 and ngc  612 due to the lack of _ chandra _ data , we estimate that the inverse compton component originating from the radio lobes is 0.1% and 1% of the nucleus emission at 5 kev , respectively , using the observed radio spectra from the lobes @xcite and a typical x - ray ( inverse compton ) to radio ( synchrotron ) flux ratio of the lobe emission @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that emission from the `` nucleus '' may also contain components from the pc - scale jets , which are seen in the vlbi images @xcite but can not be resolved with _",
    "chandra_. in fact , @xcite and @xcite suggest that the unabsorbed soft x - ray components of radio galaxies is mainly attributable to the unresolved jets , based on the correlation between the soft x - ray and radio core luminosities at 5 ghz . in this context ,",
    "the `` scattered fraction '' we discuss in our paper is only an upper limit .    for 3c  403",
    ", we can compare our results of the scattered fraction and absorption column density of the transmitted component obtained through x - ray spectroscopy with those estimated by @xcite from the near - infrared ( nir ) and optical imaging data .",
    "@xcite calculate the scattered fraction and extinction from the `` observed '' ratios of the optical ( continuum or line ) luminosity to the nir one , assuming the typical `` intrinsic '' luminosity ratios obtained for radio loud agns .",
    "our result , @xmath165% , is smaller than their estimate , @xmath166% , though within the errors .",
    "this possible discrepancy may be explained if there is another unabsorbed component in the nir / optical lights in addition to the scattered one , such as thermal emission from hot dust in the torus , and/or if there was time variability in the direct nir / optical fluxes , which were measured from short term observations .",
    "the column density derived from the x - ray data is @xmath1410 times larger than that converted from the estimated extinction , @xmath167 mag , assuming the galactic standard relation @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "this suggests much smaller dust - to - gas ratio in the torus than galactic gas , as reported for many other agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "applying analytic spectral models that are commonly used to represent the x - ray nuclear spectra of agns ( i.e. , a cutoff power law and reflection component ) , we constrain the reflection strength in terms of the solid angle of the reflector to be @xmath169 for both 3c  403 and ic  5063 . a similar value ( @xmath170 when normalized to the bat flux ) is obtained for ngc  612 by @xcite , while a weaker reflection ( @xmath171 at 90% confidence limit ) is found from another nlrg , 3c  33 .",
    "these results suggest that a major fraction of nlrgs show only a moderately strong reflection component in their x - ray spectra , like many seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite , implying that their tori have a sufficiently large solid angle to produce the reprocessed emission .",
    "thus , there is no evidence that the torus structure is systematically different between radio galaxies and seyfert galaxies , although studies of a larger nlrg sample are required to investigate this issue .",
    "the reason for the weak reflection in 3c  33 is unclear but may be connected to its high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath172  erg  s@xmath18 in the 2100 kev band ) compared with the other nlrgs .",
    "the application of the numerical torus model where a realistic geometry is assumed gives useful insights into the torus structure , as demonstrated in our previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for our targets",
    ", we can not constrain the torus opening angle due to the limited photon statistics ; in 3c  403 since values of @xmath173 = @xmath174 , @xmath175 , or @xmath176 yields a very similar @xmath24 value , and thus we can not determine if the torus of 3c  403 is close to that of `` new type '' agns or to `` classical type '' @xcite from our data alone .",
    "as for ic  5063 we have a reasonable constraint on the torus geometry from the measurement of the ionization cone , @xmath148 .",
    "together with the fact that ngc  612 has @xmath177 @xcite , we do not find any evidence for the presence of `` new type '' agns in nlrgs studied with _",
    "suzaku _ so far , although we can not rule out its possibility for 3c  403 .",
    "we need a large sample with good quality broad band spectra to verify whether or not the distribution of population is bimodal with `` new type '' and  classical type  as proposed by @xcite , both for radio quiet and loud agns .",
    "a notable feature seen in 3c  403 , ic  5063 , and ngc  612 , is the small amount of scattering gas , parameterized as @xmath178 , reflecting the averaged column density of the scattering gas .",
    "we find @xmath179 in these radio galaxies , which is systematically smaller than that obtained for seyfert galaxies fitted with the same model , @xmath180% for ngc  3081 @xcite and 1.3@xmath181% for swift  j0255.20011 @xcite , in which the scattered component is normalized to the flux as measured with bat . as mentioned above , one must take this value only as an upper limit considering the possible contribution from the unresolved jets to the soft x - ray component .",
    "the @xmath146 value depends on the torus opening angle assumed , but the above conclusion is unchanged unless @xmath130 @xmath182 @xmath174 for 3c  403 .",
    "our result suggests that there is intrinsically little `` normal '' gas around the nucleus in radio galaxies .",
    "this result may be explained by the jet activity which can expel such gas .",
    "we note that the obtained reflection strengths and scattered fractions in 3c  403 and ic  5063 are normalized to the hard x - ray flux over 58 months obtained through the _ swift_/bat monitoring , which should give a good measure of the `` averaged '' activity of each source .",
    "in fact , without the _",
    "swift_/bat data , we obtain an apparently very strong reflection strength @xmath183 from 3c  403 .",
    "we demonstrate that such an unphysically large @xmath35 value can indeed be accounted for by time variability , as discussed in e.g. , @xcite ; the flux of the direct component was much fainter than the average flux in the past that is responsible for the reprocessed emission from large scale ( @xmath39pc ) surroundings .",
    "thus , the combination of the simultaneously obtained _ suzaku _ spectra and the long averaged _ swift_/bat is necessary to estimate a `` true '' reflection strength and scattered fraction that are free from the effects of short - term time variability .",
