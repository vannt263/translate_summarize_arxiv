    "the two - photon decay of scalar mesons represents a valuable mechanism to possibly pin down their internal structure ( see  amslerrev , achasov , li , efimov , pennington , closekirk , volkov , faessler , giacosa1,dewitt , branz , scadron1,scadron2,schumacher , narison and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", the transition of the scalar - isoscalar resonance @xmath2 into @xmath3 has received much attention in the literature .",
    "it is commonly believed that a decay width of about 3 - 5 kev would favor a quarkonium interpretation of the @xmath4 in this short work we aim to show that this is not the case : the decay width of a scalar - isoscalar quark - antiquark state , with flavor wave - function @xmath5 and a mass between 0.4 and 0.8 gev as favored by recent studies ( a mass of about 0.44 gev is the outcome of @xcite ) , turns out to be smaller than 1 kev for the physical range of parameters . when evaluating the related quark triangle - loop diagram of fig .",
    "1 care has to be taken concerning gauge invariance , for a comprehensive and detailed analysis we refer to @xcite : a ( often neglected ) term generating a consistent suppression of the decay amplitude is present , as will be discussed in sections ii and iii .",
    "the omission of this term generates an overestimate of the two - photon decay rate by at least a factor of @xmath6 considering the relevance of this process related to the nature of the @xmath1 meson , and in more general of scalar mesons ( see for instance scalars and refs . therein ) , we consider it as important to stress this point for future considerations about the interpretation of the enigmatic @xmath1-resonance .    the triangle quark loop diagram of fig .",
    "1 is typical for theories with quarks as effective degrees of freedom efimov , volkov , faessler , giacosa1,scadron1,scadron2,hatsuda , klevanski .",
    "it is evaluated both in the framework of local and nonlocal @xmath1-@xmath7 vertices . in the local case",
    "the goldberger - treiman relation on the quark level and the linear realization of chiral symmetry allow to fix the corresponding @xmath1-@xmath8 coupling constant .",
    "in the nonlocal case the finite size of the @xmath1-meson interpreted as a quarkonium state is described by means of a covariant vertex function .",
    "the results of local and nonlocal approaches are similar when @xmath9 is sufficiently below threshold set by the sum of constituent quark masses .",
    "close to threshold care has to be taken in the local case since a second possible problem can arise : the explicit momentum dependence of the @xmath1-@xmath8 coupling constant can not be neglected further .",
    "this is also a delicate point to be treated with attention .",
    "the present article is organized as follows : in the next two sections we elaborate on the formalism and the results for @xmath10 as based on a local and nonlocal interaction lagrangian , respectively . in section",
    "iv we summarize and give our conclusions .",
    "we consider the following local ( l ) interaction lagrangian @xmath11where @xmath12 is the quark doublet of @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks with the constituent mass @xmath15 ( we restrict to the isospin limit ) to be varied between 0.25 and 0.45 gev , @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the scalar - isoscalar quarkonium and the isotriplet pion field , respectively , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the corresponding coupling constants ( which are later related via symmetry and low - energy considerations ) . we will denote the meson masses by @xmath20 mev and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the latter will be varied between 0.4 and 0.8 gev .",
    "the decay of @xmath21 into @xmath3 is obtained by evaluating the diagram of fig .",
    "the decay width is explicitly given by : @xmath22where @xmath23 is the effective @xmath24 coupling constant , @xmath25 is the fine structure constant , @xmath26 the number of colors and @xmath27 refers to the coupling constant @xmath19 or @xmath18 entering in the interaction lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ intloc ] ) . the charge factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the flavor wave functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "finally , the loop integrals @xmath32 @xcite corresponding to fig",
    ". 1 are functions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are explicitly given by @xmath35 \\ , .   \\label{isigma}\\end{aligned}\\]]note that the only difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the term proportional to @xmath38 present in the integral expression of @xmath37 , which is generally neglected in the literature ( that is , the amplitudes of @xmath39 and @xmath40 can not be set equal to each other as done , for instance , in  @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of the term @xmath41 generates a destructive interference with the first term , which leads to a sizable reduction of the full amplitude @xmath42 quantitatively the ratio of amplitudes is limited by @xmath43 for values of @xmath44 in the region of applicability .",
    "thus , neglecting the additional term in @xmath45 implies an overestimate of the decay rate @xmath46 by at least a factor of @xmath47 , as already indicated in the introduction .",
    "notice that we compare the decay amplitudes @xmath48 and @xmath49 but not the corresponding decay widths : as shown below these will differ consistently because of the dependence on the third power of the meson mass in eq .",
    "( [ hgg ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the explicit calculation of decay rates .",
    "the goldberger - treiman ( gt ) relation @xmath50 with @xmath51 mev allows to determine @xmath52 as an outcome we obtain for the decay width @xmath53 ev for constituent quark masses in the range @xmath54 gev , in good agreement with the experimental result @xmath55 ev @xcite .",
    "only a very weak dependence on @xmath33 is observed .",
    "the linear realization of chiral symmetry implies @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "predictions for @xmath57 can then be obtained in dependence on the effective quark mass @xmath33 and on @xmath58 note that we limit the parameter space by the relation @xmath59 : in fact , only when this condition is met the amplitude @xmath37 remains real and no unphysical decay of the sigma meson into a quark - antiquark pair is included .",
    "furthermore , the condition @xmath56 can only be employed , if @xmath9 is safely below the threshold @xmath60 for @xmath61 the momentum dependence of @xmath18 becomes non - negligible leading to a value for @xmath18 smaller than the one obtained in the gt limit @xmath62 ; in the next section we illustrate this point in the context of the nonlocal approach .",
    "* table 1 * : @xmath63 in the local case for    @xmath64 gev at @xmath65 gev    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the decay widths decrease slowly for increasing quark mass while the dependence on the cutoff is very weak .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that @xmath66again , inclusion of the term @xmath67 of eq .",
    "( [ isigma2 ] ) is crucial to obtain these small decay widths .",
    "for instance , omission of this term leads to the incorrect result of @xmath68 kev for values of @xmath69 gev , @xmath70 gev and @xmath71 gev , which is almost a factor @xmath72 larger than the correct result of @xmath73 kev given in table 2 .    in @xcite , using a coulomb - like potential , the following expression relating the two - photon decay widths of tensor and scalar states has been derived @xmath74where @xmath75 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath76 is @xmath77 in a non - relativistic calculation , but becomes smaller ( @xmath78 ) when considering relativistic corrections .",
    "choosing as input @xmath79 gev and @xmath80 kev , eq .",
    "( [ li ] ) results with @xmath78 in values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 kev for @xmath83 and @xmath84 gev , respectively .",
    "these results are close to the corresponding numbers of table 2 . as discussed in @xcite different values of the parameter @xmath85 are obtained for different forms of the quark - antiquark potential : for instance , @xmath86 corresponds to a linear potential .",
    "then , in chanowitz the value @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ li ] ) is considered and in ref .",
    "pennington a value @xmath88 , leading to a larger decay width , is discussed . here",
    "notice that our result for a light quarkonium is rather in agreement with the choice @xmath75 and with @xmath89 see also the model in @xcite where an even smaller value of @xmath76 is obtained .",
    "notice that we have only considered sigma masses below the constituent quark mass threshold with @xmath59 and masses @xmath33 in the range of 0.25 to 0.45 gev . in order to go beyond this limit one should ( i ) either increase the constituent quark mass as done in ref .",
    "@xcite where the @xmath3 decays of the scalars between @xmath90 and @xmath91 gev have been investigated or ( ii ) use more general quark propagators which include or mimic confinement .",
    "a drawback of these extensions is that the results reached contain a stronger model dependence , thus we do not consider these options here .",
    "in this work we use the formalism developed in ref .  @xcite to study the decay of a scalar quarkonium state into two photons focusing in particular on a technical caveat of this process : a term , not present in the usual @xmath39 transition amplitude , is responsible for a sizable suppression of the @xmath10 decay rate .",
    "we considered the process @xmath10 in the quarkonium picture both for local and nonlocal approaches .",
    "in particular the nonlocal approach allows for a realistic treatment of the finite size effects of the @xmath1-meson .",
    "similar results are obtained in both cases for masses @xmath9 well below the @xmath92 threshold .",
    "closer to threshold the two - photon decay width in the local case should be taken with great care , since the momentum dependence of the coupling constant is not properly taken into account .",
    "only the nonlocal result , including finite size effects , is reliable and considerably smaller than for the local case .",
    "our final result @xmath93 kev is smaller the results of dispersive analysis of reaction @xmath94 done in refs .",
    "note , that the framework developed in ref .",
    "@xcite was based on approach of ref .",
    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite evaluated at the @xmath95 mev is @xmath96 @xmath97 , while the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is around a 40% smaller than that in ref .",
    "@xcite , mainly due to a smaller @xmath98 coupling .",
    "when discussing our results it is important to stress that two aspects have not been considered .",
    "the first one is the possible role of pion loops .",
    "note , that we consider a scenario where the @xmath1 meson is a pure @xmath99 fock state and , therefore , the @xmath1 couples directly to its constituents  quarks .",
    "the coupling with other mesons ( e.g. pions ) goes via quark loops ( a direct coupling of the @xmath1 to pions is not present ) .",
    "inclusion in a such picture of pion loops generating @xmath100 transition can occur as in fig . 5 :",
    "the corresponding amplitude is suppressed of a factor @xmath101 .",
    "our framework is restricted to the one - loop approximation and to the dominant term(s ) in the @xmath101 expansion . however , being in nature @xmath26 an explicit calculation of the next - to - leading order would surely be helpful to quantify its contribution but goes beyond the scope of present paper and is left as outlook .",
    "notice that , if we propose that the @xmath1 meson is not pure @xmath99 state and there is also two - pion component contribution to the @xmath1 meson fock state , then we should include both possible intermediate states @xmath99 and @xmath102 contributing to the two - photon transition of the @xmath1 .",
    "we plan to study the second scenario - @xmath1 being mixture of @xmath99 and @xmath102 - in future .",
    "the second aspect is related to the inclusion of finite - width effects in the evaluation of the full @xmath3-width of the sigma resonance",
    ". a careful description of this point would require the precise knowledge of the propagator of the sigma meson dressed by pion clouds : in such a way a definition of the spectral function allowing to integrate over the whole mass range up to @xmath103 gev is possible @xcite .",
    "thus , also this aspect is related to pion loops and is not performed here . however , using trial distributions such as breit - wigner one and the generalized form of ref .",
    "@xcite and varying the mass and the width an increase of few percent is observed . for instance , be the decay rate @xmath104 @xmath97 at @xmath71 gev as in the second column of table 2 : considering a 500 mev wide breit - wigner distribution the integrated width @xmath105 reads @xmath106 @xmath97 .",
    "while such effects are surely important in a precision study of the two - photon decay width they does not change the qualitative outcome of the present paper .",
    "the corresponding integrated signals decay width(s ) reported by @xcite are @xmath107 @xmath97 and @xmath108 kev , values which are not accepted as average or fit .",
    "note that a confirmation of a large experimental value , contrary to usual belief , does not favor a quarkonium interpretation of the sigma meson .",
    "as noted in the pdg2000 pdg2000 , the large value for @xmath63 could arise from an additional contribution of the broad @xmath109 . a clear experimental determination of the two - photon decay width would certainly help in clarifying the discussion related to the nature of the @xmath1-meson .",
