    "it is obvious that in order to derive the laws of the gaseous matter we do not need to employ the physics of elementary particles , it is enough to start from an effective microscopic model ( or hamiltonian ) on the level of molecular interactions . then starting from the equations of motion on the microscopic level and using a statistic and probabilistic approach ,",

    "our technique can be used to show @xcite the asymptotic scalability of conservative massively parallel algorithms for discrete - event simulation , i.e. , the fact that the _ efficiency _ of such computational schemes does not vanish with increasing the number of processing elements , but it has a lower non - trivial bound .",

    "the physics of such dynamic networks is a currently heavily investigated and a rapidly emerging field @xcite .    in order to present the basic ideas and notions in the simplest way , in the following we will restrict ourselves to one dimensional interfaces that have no overhangs .",
    "the restriction on the overhangs may actually be lifted with a proper parametrization of the surface , a problem to which we will return briefly in the concluding section .",
    "the first visual impression when we look at a rough surface @xmath3 is the extent of the fluctuations perpendicular to the substrate , in other words , the _ width _ of the fluctuations . the width ( or the rms of the height @xmath4 of the fluctuations ) is probably the most extensively studied quantity in interface physics , due to the fact that its definition is simply quantifiable and therefore measurable : @xmath5 ^ 2}-   \\left[\\overline{h(x , t)}\\right]^2 } \\ ; , \\label{width}\\ ] ] where the overline denotes the average over the substrate .",

    "the short wavelength end of the spectrum has been ignored in the literature mainly because of its non - universal character , and also because it seemed to lack such a simple quantifiable definition as the width @xmath6 .    in the following",
    "we will present a quantity that is almost as simple and intuitive as the width @xmath6 but it characterizes the high frequency components of the fluctuations and it is simply quantifiable . for illustrative purposes",
    "let us consider the classic weierstrass function defined as the @xmath7 limit of the smooth functions @xmath8 : @xmath9 figure 1a shows the graph of @xmath10 at @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( arbitrary values ) for @xmath13 in the interval @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "as one can see , by increasing @xmath15 we are adding more and more detail to the graph of the function on finer and finer length - scales .",
    "thus @xmath15 plays the role of a regulator for the microscopic cut - off length which is @xmath16 , and for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the function becomes nowhere differentiable as it was shown by hardy @xcite .    comparing the graphs of @xmath10 for lower @xmath15 values with those for higher @xmath15-s",
    "we observe that the width effectively does not change , however the curves look qualitatively very different .",
    "this is obvious from ( [ weier ] ) : adding an extra term will not change the long wavelength modes , but adds a higher frequency component to the fourier spectrum of the graph .",
    "we need to operationally define a quantifiable parameter which makes a distinction between a much ` fuzzier ' graph , such as @xmath19 and a smoother one , such as @xmath20 .",
    "the natural choice based on figure 1a is the _ number of local minima _ ( or extrema ) in the graph of function . in figure",
    "1b we present the number of local minima @xmath21 vs. @xmath15 for two different values of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , while keeping @xmath25 at the same value of @xmath11 . for all @xmath22 values ( not only for these two )",
    "the leading behaviour is exponential : @xmath26 .",
    "the inset in figure 1b shows the dependence of the rate @xmath27 as a function of @xmath22 for fixed @xmath25 .",
    "we observe that for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , but below @xmath30 the dependence crosses over to another , seemingly linear function . for @xmath28",
    "the amplitude of the extra added term in @xmath31 is large enough to prevent the cancellation of the newly appearing minima by the drop in the local slope of @xmath10 . at @xmath32",
    "the number of cancelled extrema starts to increase drastically with an exponential trend , leading to the crossover seen in the inset of figure 2b .",
    "it has been shown that the fractal dimension of the weierstrass function for @xmath28 is given by @xmath33 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for @xmath34 the weierstrass curve becomes non - fractal with a dimension of @xmath35 . by varying @xmath22 with respect to @xmath25",
    ", we are crossing a fractal - smooth transition at @xmath30 .",
    "the very intriguing observation we just come across is that even though we are in the smooth regime ( @xmath36 ) the density of minima is still a _ diverging _ quantity ( the @xmath24 curve in figure 1b ) .",
    "it is thus possible to have an infinite number of ` wrinkles ' in the weierstrass function without having a diverging length , without having a fractal in the classical sense .",
    "the transition from fractal to smooth , as @xmath22 is lowered appears as a non - analyticity in the divergence rate of the curve s wrinkledness .",
    "a rigorous analytic treatment of this problem seems to be highly non - trivial and we propose it as an open question to the interested reader .",
    "= 3.1 in    = 3.4 in    the simple example shown above suggests that there is novel and non - trivial physics lying behind the analysis of extremal point densities , and it gives extra information on the morphology of interfaces .",

    "the variable @xmath40 can be conceived as ` inverse temperature ' .",
    "obviously , for @xmath41 we obtain the number of local minima per unit interface length . the rigorous mathematical description and definitions lying at the basis of ( [ minima ] )",
    "is being presented in section iv . the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ minima ] ) is reminiscent to the partition function used in the definition of the thermodynamical formalism of one dimensional chaotic maps @xcite and also to the definition of the dynamical or rnyi entropies of these chaotic maps . in that case , however the curvatures at the minima are replaced by cylinder intervals and/or the visiting probabilities of these cylinders .",
    "we present a detailed analysis for the above quantity in case of a large class of linear langevin equations of type @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a gaussian noise term , and @xmath44 a positive real number .",
    "these langevin equations are found to describe faithfully the fluctuations of monoatomic steps on various substrates , see for a review ref .",
    "one of the interesting conclusions we came to by studying the extremal - point densities on such equations is that depending on the value of @xmath44 the typical surface morphology can be fractal , or locally smooth , and the two regimes are separated by a critical @xmath44 value , @xmath45 . in the fractal case , the interface will have infinitely many minima and cusps just as in the case of the nondifferentiable weierstrass function ( [ weier ] ) , and the extremal point densities become infinite , or if the problem is discretized onto a lattice with spacing @xmath25 , a power - law diverging behavior is observed as @xmath46 for these densities .",
    "this sudden change of the ` intrinsic roughness ' may be conceived as a phase transition even in an experimental situation . changing a parameter , such as the temperature , the _ law _ describing the fluctuations can change since the mechanism responsible for the fluctuations can change character as the temperature varies .",
    "for example , it has been recently shown using scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) measurements @xcite , that the fluctuations of single atom layer steps on @xmath47 ( 111 ) below @xmath48 correspond to the perifery diffusion mechanism ( @xmath49 ) , but above this temperature ( such as @xmath50 in their measurements ) the mechanism is attachement - detachment where @xmath51 , see also ref .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections ii and iii we define and investigate on several well known on - lattice models the minimum point density and derive exact results in the steady - state ( @xmath52 ) including finite size effects . as a practical application of these on - lattice results ,",
    "we briefly present in subsection iii.b a lattice surface - growth model which exactly describes the evolution of the simulated time - horizon for conservative massively parallel schemes in parallel computation , and solve a long - standing asymptotic scalability question for these update schemes . in section",
    "iv we lay down a more rigorous mathematical treatment for extremal point densities , and stochastic extremal point densities on the continuum , with a detailed derivation for a large class of linear langevin equations ( which are in fact the continuum counterparts of the discrete ones from section ii ) .",
    "the more rigorous treatment allows for an exact analytical evaluation not only in the steady - state , but for all times ! we identify novel characteristic dimensions that separate regimes with divergent extremal point densities from convergent ones and which give a novel understanding of the short wavelength physics behind these kinetic roughening processes .",

    "let us consider a one dimensional substrate consisting of @xmath53 lattice sites , with periodic boundary conditions . for simplicity",
    "the lattice constant is taken as unity , which clearly , represents the lower cut - off length for the effective equation of motion . for the moment let us study the discretized counterpart of the general langevin equation that describes the linear theory of molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is gaussian white noise with @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the discrete laplacian operator , i.e. , @xmath58 , applied to an arbitrary lattice function @xmath59 .",
    "this equation arrises in mbe with both surface diffusion mechanism ( the 4th order , or curvature term ) and desorption mechanism ( the 2nd order , or diffusive term ) present and it has been studied extensively by several authors @xcite .",

    "the operator for the density of local minima ( for the original surface ) is @xmath85 and its steady - state average is @xmath86 , due to translational invariance .",

    ". then from ( [ s_h ] ) one obtains : @xmath96 the former automatically follows from the @xmath97 relation .",
    "then we obtain the slope - slope correlations @xmath98 with the help of poisson summation formulas , in appendix b we show a derivation for the exact spatial correlation function , which yields @xmath99 with @xmath100 we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 . the second term in the bracket in ( [ c_phi ] ) gives a _ uniform _ power law correction , while the third one gives an exponential correction to the correlation function in the thermodynamic limit . for @xmath103 and @xmath104 one",

    "thus , in the exact closed formula ( [ c_phi ] ) a careful limiting procedure has to be taken which indeed yields the internal cancellation of the apparently divergent terms .",
    "then one obtains the exact slope correlations for the @xmath130 case : @xmath131 and for the local minimum density : @xmath132 it vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , and hence , one observes that the limits @xmath107 and @xmath104 are interchangable . for @xmath130 , @xmath53",

    "in the single - step model the height differences ( i.e. , the local slopes ) are restricted to @xmath169 , and the evolution consists of particles of height @xmath170 being deposited at the local minima . while the full dynamic behavior of the model belongs to the kpz universality class , in one dimension the steady state is governed by the ew hamiltonian @xcite .",

    "knowing the exact steady - state probability distribution @xcite , one can easily find that @xmath177 thus the exact finite - size effects for the local minimum density : @xmath178 in qualitative agreement with ( [ ezaz ] ) .",
    "one of the most challenging areas in parallel computing @xcite is the efficient implementation of dynamic monte - carlo algorithms for discrete - event simulations on massively parallel architectures .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , it has numerous practical applications ranging from magnetic systems ( the discrete events are spin flips ) to queueing networks ( the discrete events are job arrivals ) . a parallel architecture by definition contains ( usually ) a large number of processors , or processing elements ( pe - s ) . during the simulation",
    "each processor has to tackle only a fraction of the full computing task ( e.g. , a specific block of spins ) , and the algorithm has to ensure through synchronization that the underlying dynamics is not altered . in a wide range of models",
    "the discrete events are poisson arrivals .",
    "since this stochastic process is reproducible ( the sum of two poisson processes is a poisson process again with a new arrival frequency ) , the poisson streams can be simulated simultaneously on each subsystem carried by each pe . as a consequence ,",
    "the simulated time is _ local _ and _ random _ , incremented by exponentially distributed random variables on each pe . however , the algorithm has to ensure that causality accross the boundaries of the neighboring blocks is not violated .",
    "this requires a comparison between the neighboring simulated times , and waiting , if necessary ( conservative approach ) . in the simplest scenario ( one site / pe ) , this means that only those pes will be allowed to attempt the update the state of the underlying site and increment their local time , where the local simulated time is a _ local minimum _ regarding the full simulated time horizon of the system , @xmath179 , @xmath180 ( for simplicity we consider a chain - like connectivity among the pe - s but connectivities of higher degree can be treated as well ) .",
    "one can in fact think of the time horizon as a fluctuating surface with height variable @xmath181 .",
    "other examples where the update attempts are independent poisson arrivals include arriving calls in the wireless cellular network of a large metropolitan area @xcite , or the spin flip attempts in an ising ferromagnet .",
    "this extremely robust parallel scheme was introduced by lubachevsky , @xcite and it is applicable to a wide range of stochastic cellular automata with local dynamics where the discrete events are poisson arrivals .",
    "the local random time increments is , in the language of the associated surface , equivalent to depositing random amounts of ` material ' ( with an exponential distribution ) at the local minima of the surface , see figure 2 .",
    "this in fact defines a simple surface growth model which we shall refer to as ` the massively parallel exponential update model ' ( mpeu ) .",
    "the main concern about a parallel implementation is its efficiency .",
    "since in the next time step only a fraction of pe - s will get updated , i.e. , those that are in the local minima of the time horizon , while the rest are in idle , the efficiency is nothing but the average number of non - idling pe - s divided by the total number of pe - s ( @xmath53 ) , i.e. , _ the average number of minima per unit length _ , or the minimum - point density , @xmath182 .",
    "the fundamental question of the so called _ scalability _ arises : will the efficiency of the algorithm go to zero as the number of pe - s is increased ( @xmath183 ) indefinitely , or not ? if the efficiency has a non - zero lower bound for @xmath183 the algorithm is called _ scalable _ , and certainly this is the preferred type of scheme .",
    "can one design in principle such efficient algorithms ?    = 4 in    as mentioned in the introduction , we know of one example that nature provides with an efficient algorithm for a very large number of processing elements : the human brain with its @xmath184 pe - s is the largest parallel computer ever built .",

    "while the mpeu model _ exactly _ mimics the evolution of the simulated time - horizon , it can also be considered as a primitive model for ion sputtering of surfaces ( etching dynamics ) : to see this , define a new height variable via @xmath185 , i.e. flip figure 2 upside down .",
    "this means that instead of depositing material we have to take , ` etch ' , and this has to be done at the local _ maxima _ of the @xmath111 surface . in sputtering of surfaces by ion bombardement",
    "an incoming ion - projectile will most likely ` break off ' a piece from the top of a mound instead from a valley , very similar to our ` reversed ' mpeu model .",

    "the same correspondence can be applied to model the performance of the algorithm for higher - dimensional logical pe topologies .",
    "while this will involve the typical difficulties of surface - growth modeling , such as an absence of exact results and very long simulation times , it establishes potentially fruitful connections between two traditionally separate research areas .      in this subsection we briefly present a curvature driven sos surface deposition model known in the literature as the larger curvature model , and show a numerical analysis of the density of minima on this model .",
    "this model was originally introduced by kim and das sarma @xcite and krug @xcite independently , as an atomistic deposition model which fully conforms to the behaviour of the continuum fourth order linear mullins equation ( @xmath130 , @xmath190 in eq .",
    "[ h_evolution ] ) .",
    "note that the discrete analysis we presented in section ii is based on the discretization of the continuum equation using the simplest forward euler differencing scheme .",
    "the larger curvature model , however , is a _ growth _",
    "model where the freshly deposited particles diffuse on the surface according to the rules of the model until they are embedded . since in all the quantities",
    "studied so far , the correspondence ( on the level of scaling ) between the larger curvature model and the langevin equation is very good , we would expect that the dynamic scaling properties of the density of minima for both the model and the equation to be identical .",
    "the large curvature model has rather simple rules : a freshly deposited atom ( let us say at site @xmath191 ) will be incorporated at the nearest neighbor site which has largest curvature ( i.e. , @xmath192 is maximum ) .",
    "if there are more neighbors with the same maximum curvature , then one is chosen randomly .",
    "if the original site ( @xmath191 ) is among those with maximum curvature , then the atom is incorporated at @xmath191 .",

    "according to eq .",
    "( [ u4d ] ) , for the fourth order equation on the lattice , the behavior of the density of minima in the steady state scales with system size as @xmath194 . and",
    "indeed , figure 4 shows the same behaviour for the larger curvature model , as expected .",
    "note that this behavior sets in at rather small system sizes already , at about @xmath195 , meaning that the finite system size effects are rather small for the larger curvature model .",
    "this is a very fortunate property since increasing the system size means decreasing the density of minima , therefore relative statistical errors will increase .",
    "= 4 in    this can only be improved by better statistics , i.e. , with averages over larger number of runs .",
    "this becomes however quickly a daunting task , since the cross - over time toward the steady state scales with system size as @xmath196 . as we shall see in section v.a , a matematically rigorous approach to the continuum equation yields the same @xmath194 behaviour .",
    "since the density of minima does decay to zero , an algorithm corresponding to the larger curvature model ( or the mullins equation ) would _ not _ be asymptotically scalable .",
    "finally , we would like to make a brief note about the observed morphologies in the steady state for the mullins equation , or the related models .",
    "it has been shown previously @xcite that in the steady state the morphology tipically shows a single large mound ( or macroscopic groove ) . at first sight",
    "this may appear as a surprise , since we have shown that the number of minima ( or maxima ) diverges as @xmath197 ( the density vanishes as @xmath194 .",
    "there is however no contradiction , because that refers to a a mound that expands throughout the system , i.e. it is a long wavelenght structure , whereas the number of minima measures _ all _ the minima , and thus it is a short wavelenght characteristic . in the steady state",
    "we indeed have a single large , macroscopic groove , however , there are numerous small dips and humps generated by the constant coupling to the noise .",

    "the density of minima was shown in section ii to have this property in the steady - state . here",
    "we see not only that but also the fact that _ all _ @xmath40-moments show the same behavior , and even more , the time behavior before reaching the steady - state constant is not a clean power - law , but rather a decaying correction in the approach to this constant .",
    "the leading term in the temporal correction is of @xmath459 and the next - to - leading has @xmath460 .",
    "in summary , based on the analytical results presented , a short wavelength based analysis of interface fluctuations can provide us with novel type of information and give an alternative description of surface morphologies .",
    "this analysis gives a more detailed characterization and can be used to distinguish interfaces that are ` fuzzy ' from those that locally appear to be smooth , and the central quantities , the extremal - point densities are numerically and analytically accessible .",
    "the partition function - like formalism enables us to access a wide range of @xmath40-momenta of the local curvatures distribution . in the case of the stochastic evolution equations",
    "studied we could exactly relate these @xmath40-momenta to the structure function of the process via the simple quantities @xmath386 and @xmath369 . the wide spectrum of results accessed through this technique shows the richness of short wavelength physics .",
    "this physics is there , and the long wavelength approach just simply can not reproduce it , but instead may suggest an oversimplified picture of the reality . for example , the mpeu model has been shown to belong in the steady state to the ew universality class , however , _ it can not be described exactly _ by the ew equation in _ all _ respects , not even in the steady - state ! for example , the utilization ( or density of minima ) of the mpeu model is 0.24641 which for the ew model on a lattice is 0.25 .",
    "also , if one just simply looks at the steady - state configuration , one observes high _ skewness _ for the mpeu model @xcite , whereas the ew is completely up - down symmetric .",
    "this can also be shown by comparing the calculated two - slope correlators . for a number of models that belong to the kpz equation universality class ,",
    "this broken - symmetry property vs. the ew case has been extensively investigated by neergard and den nijs @xcite .",
    "the difference on the short wavelength scale between two models that otherwise belong to the same universality class lies in the existence of irrelevant operators ( in the rg sense ) .",
    "although these operators do not change universal properties , the quantities associated with them may be of very practical interest .",
    "the parallel computing example shows that the fundamental question of algorithmic scalability is answered based on the fact that the simulated time horizon in the steady state belongs to the ew universality class , thus it has a _",
    "finite _ density of local minima . the actual value of the density of local minima in the thermodynamic limit , however , strongly depends on the details of the microscopics , which in principle can be described in terms of irrelevant operators @xcite .",
    "the extremal - point densities introduced in the present paper may actually have a broader application than stochastic surface fluctuations .",
    "the main geometrical characterization of fractal curves is based on the construction of their haussdorff - besikovich dimension , or the ` box - counting ' dimension : one covers the set with small boxes of linear size @xmath216 and then track the divergence of the number of boxes needed to cover in a minimal way the whole set as @xmath216 is lowered to zero .",
    "for example , a smooth line in the plane has a dimension of unity , but the weierstrass curve of ( [ weier ] ) has a dimension of @xmath461 ( for @xmath28 ) .",
    "the actual length of a fractal curve whose dimension is larger than unity will diverge when @xmath462 .",
    "the total length at a given resolution @xmath216 is a _ global _ property of the fractal , it does not tell us about the way ` it curves ' .",
    "the novel measure we propose in ( [ minima ] ) is meant to characterize the distribution of a local property of the curve , its _ bending _ which in turn is a measure of the curve s wrinkledness . for simplicity we formulated it for functions , i.e. , for curves which are single - valued in a certain direction .",
    "this can be remedied and generalized by introducing a parametrization @xmath463 $ ] of the curve , and then plotting the local _ curvature _ vs. this parameter @xmath464 .",
    "the plot will be a single valued function on which now ( [ minima ] ) is easily defined .",
    "other desirable extensions of the present technique are : 1 ) to include a statistical description of the degeneracies of higher order , and 2 ) to repeat the analysis for higher ( such as @xmath465 ) substrate dimensions .",
    "the latter is promising an even richer spectrum of novelties , since in higher dimensions there is a plethora of singular points ( @xmath466 ) which are classified by the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix of the function in the singular point . deciphering the statistical behaviour of these various singularities for randomly evolving surfaces is an interesting challenge .",
    "the studies performed by kondev and henley @xcite on the distribution of contours on random gaussian surfaces should come to a good aid in achieving this goal .",
    "in particular we may find the method developed here useful in studying the spin - glass ground state , and the spin - glass transition problem . and at last but not the least , we invite the reader to consider instead of the langevin equations studied here , noisy wave equations , with a second derivative of the time component , or other stochastic evolution equations .",
