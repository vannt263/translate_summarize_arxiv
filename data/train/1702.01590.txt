    "<S> the theoretically derived value agrees well with the experimentally obtained one of @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , we have observed a very slow and inert response to voltage changes , which we attribute to the large capacitor that enabled a characterization of many nv centers in the first place . </S>",
    "<S> further experiments with much smaller capacitors will shed light on this behavior . </S>",
    "<S> + summarizing we have identified and characterized the positive charge state of nv centers in diamond . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated deterministic and reversible electric switching of single nv centers into the newly detected charge state . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that nuclear spin energy eigenstates are resilient under this switching operation and thus serve as probe for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> they confirmed the absence of an electronic spin , which enabled electron - spin - unlimited nuclear spin coherence storage in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the @xmath5  state does not fluoresce under @xmath72 nm illumination commonly used for @xmath3  excitation . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath5  does not contribute to photon shot noise when other proximal nv centers within the same confocal spot are optically interrogated . </S>",
    "<S> + these results pave the way for a fascinating and feasible implementation of the kane proposal for a scalable , solid - state , spin - based quantum processor @xcite . as sketched in figure  [ fig : scalable]a an h - terminated diamond surface would mute all nv based electron spins below as already discussed above ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> nanoscopic top gates selected nv centers might be switched back into @xmath3  upon request . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note , that further increase of the gate potential @xmath73 would lead to a lateral depletion of the surface conductive channel . </S>",
    "<S> the scale of the lateral depletion effect can be expressed as @xmath74 @xcite , where @xmath75 is the areal charge density in the surface channel and the exponents @xmath76 and @xmath77 are roughly in the range of 0.5 and 1 . for h - terminated diamond </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath75 value is typically in the @xmath78 range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a precise control of the depletion edge @xmath79 of about few nanometers per volt of the gate bias @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect would allow individual addressing of closely located nv centers . </S>",
    "<S> several such nv centers might then coherently interact , for example via magnetic dipole - dipole interaction @xcite , and the resulting quantum state can then be stored unharmed on the nuclear storage qubits . for readout of quantum information , </S>",
    "<S> individual nv centers are switched into @xmath3 , their nuclear spin state is transfered to the electron spin and finally readout optically without touching other nuclear spin qubits of nv centers which reside in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> + apart from the potential realization of a scalable quantum processor , the storage of quantum information has proven to be a vital resource for nanoscale quantum metrology . in ref .   a non - volatile quantum memory enhanced the performance of the nv electron spin sensor </S>",
    "<S> this enables , on the one hand , coherent interactions of the sensor qubit to spectrally highly selective @xmath80c  spin qubits . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> high spectral resolution correlation spectroscopy was demonstrated . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> spectral resolution is inversely proportional to the storage time of the quantum memory . </S>",
    "<S> our results would yield an increase of spectral resolution by a factor of five . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , muting the electron spin sensor also increases the coherence lifetime of sample spins and therefore allow for high resolution spectroscopy in the first place @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> is @xmath81ms and the longitudinal relaxation time ( diamonds ) is @xmath82s . </S>",
    "<S> we expect both values to be limited by paramagnetic noise originating from the surface and sub - surface impurities . </S>",

    "<S> nv centers under h - terminated surface are in their @xmath5  state and therefore do not couple to other nodes because of the lack of an electron spin , their nuclear spin state remains undisturbed and they do not contribute to fluorescence response when illuminated . </S>",
    "<S> individual electrodes with a positive voltage deplete the hole conducting layer locally and shift the fermi level into the @xmath3-stable region . therefore , such nv centers can be coupled to their @xmath3  neighbors via magnetic dipole interaction and they are optically accessible . </S>",
