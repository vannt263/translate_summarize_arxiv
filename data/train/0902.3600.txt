    "random walks are a popular topic in physics @xcite . the popularity stems from several sources .",
    "first , random walks are rather simple in their formulation yet powerful in their application and allow to pinpoint the essential physics involved in the studied processes .",
    "next , the random walks are one of the tools which allow to connect the microdynamics with the macrobehaviour of large systems .",
    "finally , random walks are quite flexible and popular also outside physics to describe various phenomena .",
    "hence it comes not as a surprise that the first random walks have not been formulated within physics but to describe the alternation of share prices on the stock exchange or the spreading of insects in a forest @xcite .",
    "the study of random walks obtained a new stimulus when they were combined with quantum mechanics @xcite . here the walker is thought to be a non - classical object enriched with wave attributes .",
    "the novel features of quantum walks have been shown to be not only of theoretical interest but to also have practical implications , especially for quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "an important concept is the hitting time @xcite which helps to point out the fundamental difference between classical and quantum walks allowing for algorithmic speed - up .",
    "one of the simplest non - trivial examples for a quantum walk is the one on a line @xcite which is closely related to the so called optical galton board @xcite .",
    "various aspects of one dimensional quantum walks have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "additional interesting effects , e.g. localisation , arise when one considers multi - state quantum walks @xcite .",
    "one of the characteristics of the random walk on an infinite lattice is expressed by the probability of the walker to return to its starting position , called the plya number @xcite .",
    "if the plya number equals one the walk is called recurrent , otherwise there is a non - zero probability that the walker never returns to its starting position .",
    "such walks are called transient .",
    "the recurrence nature of the random walk is determined by the asymptotic behaviour of the probability at the origin @xcite .",
    "one finds that a random walk is transient if the probability at the origin decays faster than @xmath0 .",
    "the recurrent behaviour has been studied in great detail for classical random walks in dependence on the dimension and the topology of the lattice @xcite .",
    "recently , we have extended the concept of plya number to quantum walks @xcite . in our definition",
    "we proposed a particular measurement scheme to minimize disturbance : each measurement in a series is carried out on a different member of an ensemble of equally prepared quantum systems .",
    "we have shown that the recurrence nature of the quantum walk , according to the above definition , is determined by the asymptotic behaviour of the probability at the origin in a similar way as in classical random walks . however , due to interference the asymptotics of the probability at the origin does not depend solely on the dimension of the lattice , but also on the coin operator and the initial coin state .",
    "hence , one can find strikingly different recurrence behaviour for quantum walks compared to their classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "note that recurrence is meant here as the return to the origin which can be considered as a fractional recurrence from the point of view of the whole quantum state @xcite so far we have considered balanced walks , i.e. ones where there is no preference in direction for the walker and the step lengths are equal . for a large class of quantum",
    "walks this assumption does not hold and we wish to study the implications of unbalanced coins and unequal step lengths for the recurrence properties .    in the present paper",
    "we study biased quantum walks on the line and compare their properties with their classical counterparts . as we briefly review in [ app : a ] , recurrence of classical random walks is a consequence of the walk s symmetry .",
    "they are recurrent if and only if the mean value of the position of the particle vanishes .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spreading of the probability distribution of the position is diffusive while the mean value of the position propagates with a constant velocity .",
    "in contrast , for quantum walks both the spreading of the probability distribution and the propagation of the mean value are ballistic .",
    "we show that this allows for maintaining recurrence even when the symmetry is broken .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we describe the biased quantum walk on a line . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we solve the time evolution equations with the help of the fourier transformation .",
    "we find that the probability amplitudes can be expressed in terms of integrals where time enters only in the rapidly oscillating phase factor .",
    "this fact allows a straightforward asymptotic analysis of the probability amplitudes by means of the method of stationary phase .",
    "we perform this analysis in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "since the recurrence of the quantum walk is determined by the asymptotics of the probability at the origin we find a condition under which the biased quantum walk on a line is recurrent . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we analyze the recurrence of biased quantum walks from a different perspective .",
    "we find that the recurrence is related to the velocities of the peaks of the probability distribution generated by the quantum walk .",
    "the explicit form of the velocities leads us to the same condition derived in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec6 ] we analyze the formula for the mean value of the position of the particle derived in [ app : b ] in dependence of the parameters of the walk and the initial state .",
    "we find that there exist genuine biased quantum walks which are recurrent .",
    "conclusions and outlook are left for section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "let us consider biased quantum walks on a line where the particle has two possibilities  jump to the right or to the left .",
    "without loss of generality we restrict ourselves to biased quantum walks where the jump to the right is of the length @xmath1 and the jump to the left has a unit size .",
    "we depict the biased quantum walk schematically in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the particle moves to the right to a point at distance @xmath1 . with the coin state @xmath2 the particle makes a unit length step to the left . before the step itself",
    "the coin state is rotated according to the coin operator @xmath3.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the hilbert space of the particle has the form of the tensor product @xmath4 of the position space @xmath5 and the two dimensional coin space @xmath6 a single step of the quantum walk is given by the propagator @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes the unit operator acting on the position space @xmath9 .",
    "the displacement operator @xmath10 has the form @xmath11 the coin flip @xmath12 is in general an arbitrary unitary operator acting on the coin space @xmath13 and is applied on the coin state before the displacement @xmath10 itself .",
    "however , as has been discussed in @xcite the probability distribution is not affected by the complex phases of the coin operator .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to consider the one - parameter family of coins @xmath14 from now on we restrict ourselves to this family of coins .",
    "the value of @xmath15 corresponds to the well known case of the hadamard walk .",
    "we write the initial state of the particle in the form @xmath16 the state of the walker after @xmath17 steps is given by successive application of the time evolution operator given by eq .",
    "( [ qw : time ] ) on the initial state @xmath18 the state of the particle is fully determined by the set of two - component vectors @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the probability amplitude to find the particle at position @xmath21 after @xmath17 steps with the coin state @xmath22 . the probability distribution generated by the quantum walk is given by @xmath23",
    "to obtain explicit and closed form expressions for the time dependent state vector we rewrite the time evolution equation ( [ time : evol ] ) for the state vector @xmath24 into a set of difference equations @xmath25 for the probability amplitude vectors @xmath26 .",
    "the form of the matrices @xmath27 follows from the matrix @xmath3 @xmath28    the time evolution equations ( [ time : evol2 ] ) are greatly simplified with the help of the fourier transformation @xmath29 where the momentum @xmath30 is a continuous parameter ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath32 . the new function @xmath33 is square integrable on a unit circle .",
    "the time evolution in the fourier picture turns into a single difference equation @xmath34 where the propagator has the form @xmath35 the solution of ( [ qw : te : fourier ] ) is straightforward .",
    "we find @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fourier transformation of the initial state .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the situation where the particle is initially localized at the origin as dictated by the nature of the problem we wish to study .",
    "as follows from ( [ qw : ft ] ) the fourier transformation @xmath37 of such an initial condition is equal to the initial state of the coin @xmath38 which we denote by @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath39 can be an arbitrary normalized complex two - component vector we parameterize it by two parameters @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 in the form @xmath42 to evaluate the powers of the propagator @xmath43 it is convenient to diagonalize it . since the propagator is unitary its eigenvalues have the form @xmath44 where the phases read @xmath45 we denote the corresponding eigenvectors by @xmath46 .",
    "we give their explicit form in the [ app : b ] . with this notation",
    "we write the solution of the time evolution equation in the fourier picture in the form @xmath47 here @xmath48 means scalar product in the coin space .",
    "finally , we obtain the solution in position representation by performing the inverse fourier transformation @xmath49",
    "to determine the recurrence nature of the biased quantum walk we have to analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the probability at the origin @xcite . exploiting ( [ inv : f ] ) the amplitude at the origin reads @xmath50 which allows us to find the asymptotics of the probability at the origin with the help of the method of stationary phase @xcite .",

    "we plot the implicit functions @xmath60 for @xmath58 .",
    "the plot indicates that for @xmath61 the phases @xmath51 do not have any saddle points .",

    "the parameter of the coin @xmath59 has to be at least equal to a factor determined by the size of the step to the right @xmath1 for the walk to be recurrent .",
    "we note that the recurrence nature of the biased quantum walk on a line is determined only by the parameters of the walk itself , i.e. the coin and the step , not by the initial conditions .",
    "the parameters of the initial state @xmath63 and @xmath64 have no effect on the rate of decay of the probability at the origin .",
    "we can determine the recurrence nature of the biased quantum walk on a line from a different point of view .",
    "this approach is based on the following observation .",
    "the well known shape of the probability distribution generated by the quantum walk consists of two counter - propagating peaks . in between the two dominant peaks",
    "the probability is roughly independent of @xmath21 and decays like @xmath0 . on the other hand , outside",
    "the decay is exponential as we depart from the peaks .",
    "as it has been found in @xcite the position of the peaks varies linearly with the number of steps .",
    "hence , the peaks propagate with constant velocities , say @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for the biased quantum walk to be recurrent the origin of the walk has to remain in between the two peaks for all times . in other words ,",
    "the biased quantum walk on a line is recurrent if and only if the velocity of the left peak is negative and the velocity of the right peak is positive .",
    "the velocities of the left and right peaks are easily determined .",
    "we rewrite the formula ( [ inv : f ] ) for the probability amplitude @xmath26 into the form @xmath67 where we have introduced @xmath68 . due to the fact that we now concentrate on the amplitudes at the positions",
    "@xmath69 we have to consider modified phases @xmath70 the peak occurs at such a position @xmath71 where both the first and the second derivatives of @xmath72 vanishes .",
    "the velocity of the peak is thus @xmath73 .",

    "consequently , this quantum walk is recurrent.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the peak velocities have two contributions .",
    "one is identical and independent of @xmath59 , the second is a product of @xmath1 and @xmath59 and differs in sign for the two velocities .",
    "the obtained results indicate that biasing the walk by having the size of the step to the right equal to @xmath1 results in dragging the whole probability distribution towards the direction of the larger step .",
    "this is manifested by the term @xmath86 which appears in both velocities @xmath76 with the same sign . on the other hand",
    "the parameter of the coin @xmath59 does not bias the walk . as we can see from the second terms entering the velocities it rather influences the rate at which the walk spreads .",
    "as we have discussed above the biased quantum walk on a line is recurrent if and only if @xmath65 is negative and @xmath66 is positive .",
    "the form of the velocities ( [ velocities ] ) implies that this condition is satisfied if and only if the criterion ( [ crit : rec ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "as we discuss in the [ app : a ] the classical random walks are recurrent if and only if the mean value of the position vanishes . we now show that this is not true for biased quantum walks , i.e. there exist biased quantum walks on a line which are recurrent but can not produce probability distribution with zero mean value .",
    "this is another unique feature of quantum walks compared to the classical ones .    in the [ app : b ]",
    "we derive the following formula for the position mean value @xmath87 we see that for quantum walks the mean value is affected by both the fundamental walk parameters through @xmath1 and @xmath59 and the initial state parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the mean value is typically non - vanishing even for unbiased quantum walks ( with @xmath88 ) .",
    "however , one easily finds @xcite that the initial state with the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 results in a symmetric probability distribution with zero mean independent of the coin parameter @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , the quantum walks with @xmath88 , i.e. with equal steps to the right and left , do not intrinsically distinguish left from right . on the other hand",
    "the quantum walks with @xmath91 treat the left and right direction in a different way .",
    "nevertheless , one can always find for a given @xmath1 a coin parameter @xmath92 such that for all @xmath93 the quantum walk can produce a probability distribution with zero mean value .",
    "this is impossible for quantum walks with @xmath94 and we will call such quantum walks genuine biased .    let us now determine the minimal value of @xmath59 for a given @xmath1 for which mean value vanishes .",
    "we first find the parameters of the initial state @xmath63 and @xmath64 which minimizes the mean value .",
    "clearly the term on the second line in ( [ mean ] ) reaches the minimal value for @xmath95 . differentiating the resulting expression with respect to @xmath63 and",
    "setting the derivative equal to zero gives us the condition @xmath96 on the minimal mean value with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "this relation is satisfied for @xmath97 .",
    "the resulting formula for the mean value reads @xmath98 this expression vanishes for @xmath99 since ( [ mean : min ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath59 the mean value is always positive for @xmath94 independent of the choice of the initial state . for @xmath100",
    "one can achieve zero mean value for different combination of the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the formula ( [ rho:0 ] ) is reminiscent of the condition ( [ crit : rec ] ) for the biased quantum walk on a line to be recurrent .",
    "however , @xmath1 is in ( [ rho:0 ] ) replaced by @xmath101 .",
    "therefore we find the inequality @xmath102 .",
    "hence , the quantum walks with the coin parameter @xmath103 are recurrent but can not produce a probability distribution with zero mean value .",
    "we conclude that there are genuine biased quantum walks which are recurrent in contrast to situations found for classical walks .",
    "we have analyzed one dimensional biased quantum walks .",
    "classically , the bias leading to a non - zero mean value of the particle s position can be introduced in two ways  unequal step lengths or unfair coin .",
    "in contrast , for quantum walks on a line the initial state can introduce bias for any coin . on the other hand , for symmetric initial state modifying only the unitary coin operator while keeping the equal step lengths will not introduce bias . finally , the bias due to unequal step lengths may be compensated for by the choice of the coin operator for some initial conditions .",
    "for this reason we have introduced the concept of the genuinely biased quantum walk for which there does not exists any initial state leading to vanishing mean value of the position .",
    "we have determined the conditions under which one dimensional biased quantum walks are recurrent .",
    "this together with the condition of being genuinely biased give rise to three different regions in the parameter space which we depict as a `` phase diagram '' in figure  [ fig4 ] .     and",
    "the vertical axis shows the coin parameter @xmath59 .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the recurrence criterion ( [ crit : rec ] ) , while the squares represent the condition ( [ rho:0 ] ) on the zero mean value of the particle s position .",
    "the quantum walks in the white area are transient and genuine biased . in between the two curves ( light gray area )",
    "we find quantum walks which are recurrent but still genuine biased .",
    "the quantum walks in the dark gray area are recurrent and for a particular choice of the initial state they can produce probability distribution with vanishing mean value.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the presented results allow for generalization to biased quantum walks in higher dimensions assuming we keep the coin operator in a tensorial form . for non - factorizable coin operators in higher dimensions it remains an open question when they are recurrent or transient .",

    "classical random walks on a line can be biased in two ways - the step in one direction is greater than in the other one and the probability of the step to the right is different from the probability of the step to the left ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .     with the probability @xmath104 .",

    "<S> the plya number of a classical random walk on a regular lattice is known to depend solely on the dimension of the lattice . for one and two dimensions it equals one , meaning unit probability to return to the origin . </S>",
    "<S> this result is extremely sensitive to the directional symmetry , any deviation from the equal probability to travel in each direction results in a change of the character of the walk from recurrent to transient . applying our definition of the plya number to quantum walks on a line </S>",
    "<S> we show that the recurrence character of quantum walks is more stable against bias . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the range of parameters for which biased quantum walks remain recurrent . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there exist genuine biased quantum walks which are recurrent . </S>"
