    "much of the fascination with the information - theoretic properties of quantum systems derives from collective phenomena and processes .",
    "on one hand , the information contained in entangled quantum systems is of a collective nature and is central to many intriguing applications of quantum information , such as teleportation and quantum computing . on the other , there are collective operations , such as collective measurements on several quantum systems . broadly speaking ,",
    "collective measurements on a set of systems can yield more , or better information than one can obtain by carrying out separate measurements on the individual subsystems , even if these are not entangled .",
    "for example , the use of collective measurements is essential for attaining the true classical capacity of a quantum channel@xcite , since capacities attained with receivers performing collective measurements on increasingly large strings of signal states are superadditive .",
    "a further illustration of the superiority of collective over individual measurements is the ` nonlocality without entanglement ' discovered by bennett et al@xcite .",
    "this refers to the fact that one can construct a set of orthogonal product states which can only be perfectly distinguished by a collective measurement .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a further demonstration of the increased knowledge that can be obtained using collective rather than individual measurements , relating to unambiguous state discrimination@xcite .",
    "such measurements can reveal , with zero probability of error , the state of a quantum system , even if the possible states are nonorthogonal .",
    "perfect discrimination between nonorthogonal states is impossible and the price we pay is the non - zero probability of inconclusive results .",
    "it has been established that unambiguous discrimination is possible only for linearly independent states@xcite . however , suppose that the possible states form a linearly dependent set , but we have @xmath3 copies of the actual state at our disposal .",
    "unambiguous discrimination is impossible using separate measurements on the individual copies . if , however , the possible @xmath0 particle states form a linearly independent set , then unambiguous discrimination will be possible by carrying out a collective measurement on all @xmath0 copies .    in section",
    "ii , we derive one necessary and one sufficient condition for @xmath1 states to be amenable to unambiguous discrimination , given that @xmath0 copies of the state are available and that the possible single copy states span a finite , @xmath2 dimensional space . for qubits ( @xmath4 ) , these conditions are identical . in section iii",
    ", we work out in detail a specific example , that of multiple copies of the so - called trine states .",
    "the trine set is linearly dependent , although the set comprised of multiple copies of these states is linearly independent for @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , these states are the lifted trine states recently discussed in a different but related context by shor@xcite .",
    "we obtain the maximum discrimination probability for these multi - trine states with equal a priori probabilities and find that it has some curious , unexpected features .",
    "consider the following scenario : a quantum system is prepared in one of the @xmath1 pure states @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "these states are nonorthogonal and we would like to determine which state has been prepared . if we are unwilling to tolerate errors , then we should adopt an unambiguous discrimination strategy .",
    "such a measurement will have @xmath8 outcomes ; @xmath1 of these correspond to the possible states and a further outcome gives inconclusive results .",
    "it has been established that the zero errors constraint leads to a nonzero probability of inconclusive results for nonorthogonal states@xcite .",
    "suppose that the @xmath6 span a @xmath2 dimensional hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , @xmath10 . if @xmath11 , then the states are linearly independent . if , on the other hand , @xmath12 , then they are linearly dependent . whether or not the set is linearly independent is crucial , since linear independence is the necessary and sufficient condition for a set of pure states to be amenable to unambiguous discrimination@xcite .",
    "if , however , instead of having just one copy of the state , we have @xmath3 copies , that is , one of the states @xmath13 , then there is the possibility that , even if @xmath14 is a linearly dependent set , @xmath15 may be linearly independent , making unambiguous discrimination possible .",
    "it is of interest to determine the conditions under which this is so . here",
    ", we will obtain two general results relating to the number of states that can be unambiguously discriminated , given that the single copies span a @xmath2 dimensional space and that @xmath0 copies of the state are available .",
    "firstly , we will show that the number of states which can be unambiguously discriminated satisfies the inequality @xmath16 to see why , let us denote by @xmath17 the symmetric subspace of @xmath18 .",
    "the states @xmath13 are invariant under any permutation of the states of the single copies and thus lie in @xmath17 . denoting by @xmath19 the dimension of @xmath20 ,",
    "it can be shown that@xcite @xmath21 the @xmath13 will be linearly dependent if @xmath1 is greater than the dimension of @xmath17 .",
    "this , together with eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) , leads to inequality ( 2.1 ) , which is a necessary condition for unambiguous discrimination between @xmath1 states spanning a @xmath2 dimensional space given @xmath0 copies of the state .",
    "this bound holds for all pure states .",
    "it is tight , in the sense that for all @xmath22 , there exists a set of @xmath1 pure states @xmath14 such that the equality in ( 2.1 ) is satisfied and the set @xmath15 is linearly independent . to prove this , we make use of the fact that @xmath17 is the subspace of @xmath18 spanned by the states @xmath23 , for all @xmath24 .",
    "the set of states @xmath25 is linearly dependent .",
    "however , every linearly dependent set spanning a vector space @xmath26 has a linearly independent subset which is a basis for @xmath26@xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be such a subset of @xmath25 for @xmath27 .",
    "these states are linearly independent and satisfy the equality in ( 2.1 ) since @xmath28 .",
    "we now show that any @xmath1 distinct pure states can be unambiguously discriminated if @xmath29 here , the elements of the set @xmath14 are considered distinct iff @xmath30",
    ". it will suffice to show that if @xmath31 , then the states @xmath13 are linearly independent . to see why , we simply note that if this can be shown , then our more general claim will be true as a consequence of the fact that any subset of a linearly independent set is also linearly independent .    to prove that inequality ( 2.3 ) is a sufficient condition for unambiguous discrimination",
    ", we assume that @xmath31 and again make use of the fact that any linearly dependent set has a linearly independent spanning subset .",
    "the set @xmath14 then has a subset of @xmath2 linearly independent states , which we shall denote by @xmath32 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can relabel all states according to the index @xmath33 in such a way that @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "let us now consider the sets @xmath36 , for @xmath37 .",
    "notice that @xmath32 accords with our previous definition and that @xmath38 . we will use induction to prove that @xmath15 is linearly independent .",
    "the set @xmath32 is linearly independent by definition .",
    "we will show that if @xmath39 is linearly independent , then so is @xmath40 . to do this",
    ", we shall require the following : + *    * lemma .",
    "_ let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be sets of distinct , normalised state vectors which have equal cardinality .",
    "consider any normalised states @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is distinct from all elements of @xmath46 .",
    "if the set @xmath47 is linearly independent , then so is the set @xmath48 . _ + * *    a proof of this is given in the appendix .",
    "the linear independence of @xmath39 can be seen to imply that of @xmath40 if we make the identifications : @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the set @xmath38 is linearly independent and this completes the proof .",
    "we have shown that ( 2.3 ) is a sufficient condition for unambiguous discrimination between @xmath1 states spanning a @xmath2 dimensional space given @xmath0 copies of the state .",
    "like the necessary condition in ( 2.1 ) , this bound is the tightest we can obtain using @xmath50 and @xmath2 alone , in the sense that for all values of these parameters which do not satisfy ( 2.3 ) , there exists a set of states @xmath15 which is linearly dependent . to prove this , suppose that for @xmath35 , the @xmath6 are linearly independent and that for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , for some complex coefficients @xmath53 .",
    "if ( 2.3 ) is not satisfied , then @xmath54 and the subspace spanned by @xmath55 and @xmath56 contains at least @xmath57 states in the set @xmath14 .",
    "we will now see that the set of states @xmath58 is linearly dependent . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the @xmath6 all lie in the same two dimensional subspace , so that the corresponding @xmath0-fold copies @xmath13 lie in the symmetric subspace of @xmath0 qubits , which , from eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) , is @xmath60 dimensional .",
    "it follows that if there are at least @xmath57 of these states , they must be linearly dependent .",
    "this implies that the entire set of @xmath0-fold copies @xmath61 is linearly dependent .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions , ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.3 ) , for the linear independence of @xmath0 copies of @xmath1 states , with single copy hilbert space dimension @xmath2 are thus the most complete statements that can be made about the possibility of unambiguous discrimination given only these three parameters .",
    "these two bounds are also , in general , different from each other , which implies that for a particular set of states , additional , more detailed information about the set may be useful .",
    "however , this is not the case for @xmath4 . for the case of qubits",
    ", these bounds are identical and equal to @xmath60 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for the possibility of unambiguous discrimination between @xmath1 pure , distinct states of a qubit , given @xmath0 copies of the state , is then @xmath62 the generality of this result is quite remarkable , since it is completely independent of the actual states involved",
    ". these will , however , have a strong bearing on the maximum probability of success .",
    "having discussed in the preceding section the conditions under which unambiguous discrimination between multiple copies of linearly dependent states is possible , let us examine in detail one particular example , that of the so - called ` trine ' set .",
    "consider a qubit whose two dimensional hilbert space is denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 be an orthonormal basis for @xmath63 .",
    "then the following states form the trine set : @xmath65 these states are clearly linearly dependent and so can not be unambiguously discriminated at the level of one copy . given only a single copy , we must tolerate a nonzero error probability in any attempt to distinguish between these states . if they have equal a priori probabilities of 1/3 , then the minimum error probability is also equal to 1/3@xcite .",
    "the optimum such measurement has recently been carried out in the laboratory , where the trine set was implemented as a set of nonorthogonal optical polarisation states@xcite .",
    "applications of the trine set and optimal measurements to quantum key distribution are discussed in@xcite .",
    "the trine set may be regarded as a special case of a more general set of states having the same 3-fold rotational symmetry , but also having a component in a third direction , which exists in a larger , 3 dimensional hilbert space @xmath66 .",
    "let this third dimension be spanned by the vector @xmath67 orthogonal to both @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this generalised trine set may be written as @xmath70 for some real parameter @xmath71 $ ] known as the _ lift _ parameter .",
    "when @xmath72 , the @xmath73 are just the coplanar trine states . if , however , @xmath74 , then the states are lifted out of the plane and are linearly independent for @xmath75 .",
    "these are known as _ lifted trine states_@xcite . as the lift parameter",
    "is increased , the states become increasingly distinct until @xmath76 , at which point they are orthogonal . increasing @xmath77 further serves to draw the three states closer to @xmath67 axis until @xmath78 , at which point @xmath79 .    in this section",
    ", we show that the set of @xmath80fold copies of the trine set , which we refer to as a multi - trine set , may be represented as a lifted trine set .",
    "we will use this , together with the fact that the maximum discrimination probability for lifted - trine states can be derived exactly , to determine the maximum discrimination probability for multiple copies of the trine states for equal a priori probabilities .    to show that the states @xmath81 are lifted trine states",
    ", we will make use of the fact that the states @xmath82 , for @xmath83 , are also lifted trine states , with a different , nonzero lift parameter . to see this ,",
    "let us define the three orthogonal states :    @xmath84    then the @xmath85 may be written as @xmath86 where the parameter @xmath87 is @xmath88 comparison of the @xmath85 with the @xmath73 shows that they are indeed lifted trine states , with lift parameter @xmath87 , given by eq .",
    "also , for all @xmath83 , @xmath89 and the @xmath85 are linearly independent .",
    "we can now use simple induction to show that the states @xmath81 are lifted trine states . in the above argument",
    ", if we let @xmath90 , i.e. , take @xmath72 , then we find that @xmath91 and that these are lifted trine states with lift parameter @xmath92 . for the inductive step , we can say that if @xmath93 is a set of lifted trine states with lift parameter @xmath94 , then so is the set @xmath81 , with some lift parameter @xmath95 .",
    "it follows from eq .",

    "( 3.13 ) .      to determine the maximum discrimination probability for the lifted trine set with equal a priori probabilities , we make use of the theorem in@xcite which gives the maximum discrimination probability for equally probable , linearly independent symmetrical states .    a set of @xmath1 linearly",
    "independent symmetric states can be expressed as @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the maximum discrimination probability is @xmath102 for the lifted trine states , we define the following orthogonal states : @xmath103 in terms of these states , one can easily verify that the lifted trine states have the form @xmath104 one can verify that these expressions are of the form ( 3.14 ) if we take the coefficients @xmath105 to be @xmath106 making use of these expressions and employing ( 3.15 ) , we find that the maximum discrimination probability for the lifted trine states is @xmath107 the behaviour of @xmath108 as a function of @xmath77 is illustrated in figure ( 1 ) . for @xmath109 , @xmath110 , which increases monotonically to 1 until the orthogonality point @xmath76 . for @xmath111 , @xmath112 , which decreases monotonically , reaching zero when @xmath78 , at which point all three states are identical .    we have shown how to calculate the maximum discrimination probability for lifted trine states .",
    "we will now see how these results can be used to obtain the maximum discrimination probability for multiple copies of the trine states .",
    "[ 1 ] of unambiguous discrimination between lifted trine states as a function of the lift parameter @xmath77 . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the states are linearly dependent and so unambiguous discrimination is impossible .",
    "however , at @xmath114 , the states are orthogonal and can be discriminated with unit probability.,title=\"fig : \" ]      we are now in a position to calculate the maximum discrimination probability for the states @xmath81 .",
    "it follows from ( 2.8 ) that the necessary and sufficient condition for unambiguous discrimination is that @xmath5 .",
    "making use of ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.24 ) , we see that the maximum discrimination probability is @xmath115 it is quite straightforward to show that the smaller of these two terms is determined solely by whether @xmath0 is even or odd and we find @xmath116 some interesting observations can be made about this result .",
    "firstly , the minimum probability of inconclusive results , given by @xmath117 , decreases exponentially with @xmath0 , with even and odd cases considered separately .",
    "however , eq . ( 3.26 ) has the peculiar , unexpected property that @xmath118 for even @xmath0 . that is , adding another copy to an even number of copies does not increase the maximum discrimination probability .",
    "this behaviour provides an interesting exception to the trend observed in state estimation / discrimination that the more copies we have of the state , the better we can determine it@xcite .",
    "one further curious feature of the maximum discrimination probability in eq .",
    "( 3.26 ) is that it can be attained by carrying out collective discrimination measurements only on pairs of copies of the state .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is even ; if it is not , we can , in view of the above property of @xmath119 , simply discard one of the copies .",
    "we divide the set of copies into @xmath120 pairs and carry out an optimal discrimination measurement on each pair",
    ". the probability of success for one pair is @xmath121 .",
    "the success probability for all @xmath0 copies by this method is simply the probability that not all of the @xmath120 pairwise measurements give inconclusive results , which is simply @xmath122^{c/2}$ ] . into this we insert @xmath123 , which is the special case of ( 3.26 ) for @xmath124 and",
    "obtain the general maximum discrimination probability in eq .",
    "the ability to do optimum discrimination for this ensemble with only pairwise discrimination measurements is clearly convenient from a practical perspective .",
    "it is impossible to discriminate unambiguously between a set of linearly dependent states . if , however , we have access to more than one copy belonging to such a set , then the compound states may be linearly independent and thus amenable to unambiguous discrimination .",
    "this is the possibility we explored in this paper .",
    "it is natural to search for any general limitations on the extent to which this is achievable .",
    "the most natural parameters to consider are @xmath2 , the dimension of the hilbert space of a single copy , @xmath0 , the number of copies and @xmath1 , the number of states .",
    "we derived one necessary and one sufficient condition , respectively ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.3 ) , for @xmath1 states to be amenable to unambiguous discrimination for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "these conditions were shown to be identical for @xmath4 and combining them , which gives ( 2.8 ) , solves the problem completely for qubits .",
    "we then worked out in detail the specific example of unambiguous discrimination between @xmath5 copies of the trine states .",
    "we showed how such multi - trine states can be interpreted as lifted trine states , for which the maximum unambiguous discrimination probability can be calculated exactly .",
    "we also found that if @xmath0 is even , then adding a further copy , strangely , fails to increase the maximum discrimination probability .",
    "also , we described how the optimum measurement for arbitrary @xmath5 can be carried out by performing discrimination measurements only on pairs of copies .",
    "we conclude with an observation regarding the related subject of probabilistic cloning .",
    "it was established by duan and guo@xcite that a set of quantum states can be probabilistically copied exactly if and only if they are linearly independent .",
    "this result is rigorously correct for @xmath125 cloning .",
    "if , however , @xmath126 copies of the state are initially available , then sometimes @xmath127 cloning will be possible for linearly dependent sets .",
    "a sufficient condition is the linear independence of the states @xmath13 . when this is so , probabilistic exact cloning may be accomplished , for example , by carrying out an unambiguous discrimination measurement to determine the state then manufacturing @xmath128 copies of the state .",
    "* proof : * we prove this by contradiction . if the set @xmath48 is linearly dependent , then there exist coefficients @xmath129 and @xmath130 such that @xmath131 where not all of the coefficients in @xmath132 are zero .",
    "in fact , we can show that at least two of the @xmath130 are nonzero .",
    "if only one of the @xmath130 were nonzero , then the corresponding @xmath133 would be equal to either @xmath45 ( up to a phase ) or the zero vector , depending on whether or not @xmath134 .",
    "the latter possibility contradicts the premises of the lemma ( normalisation ) .",
    "the former does also , since it would imply that for the nonzero @xmath130 , @xmath133 is not distinct from @xmath45 .",
    "the set @xmath47 is linearly independent , so there exists a set of reciprocal states @xmath135 such that @xmath136 and @xmath137 . acting on eq .",
    "( a.1 ) throughout with @xmath138 gives @xmath139 the fact that at least two of the @xmath130 are nonzero implies that the corresponding @xmath133 will be indistinct , contradicting the premise .",
