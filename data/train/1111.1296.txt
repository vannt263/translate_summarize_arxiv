    "the galactic population of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) are x - ray luminous , interacting binaries in which a donor star ( @xmath1 ) transfers material to a neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) compact object ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) contain donor stars @xmath3 and typically have orbital periods ( @xmath4 ) ranging from hours to days ( liu , van paradijs & van den heuvel 2007 ) , while high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) have donor stars @xmath5 and @xmath6 several days to tens of days ( liu , van paradijs & van den heuvel 2006 ) .    from the very first decade of satellite x - ray astronomy ( the 1970s ) , long - term",
    "monitoring revealed modulations that were quasi - periodic on time - scales substantially longer than their well - established orbital periods .",
    "these included results from missions such as ariel v s all sky monitor ( e.g. kaluzienski et al . 1976 ) and vela 5b ( e.g. priedhorsky & terrell 1983 , 1984 ) .",
    "her x-1 , with its 35 d on / off cycle ( which is remarkably stable , at @xmath7 ) exhibits the prototypical `` superorbital '' period ( petterson 1977 ) .      such superorbital variations ( @xmath8 )",
    "are seen to occur on time - scales of tens to hundreds of days , and are thought to be related to the properties of the accretion disc ( and occasionally linked to the donor ) .",
    "many of these have been determined for a number of sources , using archival data from later x - ray satellite missions such as cgro s batse ( e.g. robinson et al .",
    "1997 ) , rxte s all sky monitor ( asm ; e.g. wen et al . 2006 ) and swift s burst alert telescope ( e.g. farrell , barret & skinner 2009 ) .",
    "most recently , superorbital behaviour and the various mechanisms proposed to account for it , have been summarised in charles et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "radiation - induced warping ( ogilvie & dubus 2001 , hereafter od01 ) and/or precession ( whitehurst & king 1991 ) of the accretion disc may lead to periodic / quasi - periodic superorbital modulation of the x - ray flux , e.g. cyg x-2 , her x-1 , lmc x-4 & smc x-1 ( clarkson et al .",
    "however , superorbital variations may also occur as the result of other mechanisms . here",
    "we briefly introduce the physical processes that have been proposed .",
    "precession of accretion discs may occur if @xmath90.25 - 0.33 , due to resonances excited in the discs resulting from tidal interaction with the donor ( whitehurst & king 1991 ) .",
    "this occurs in the su uma sub - class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; warner 1995 ) and the soft x - ray transients ( sxts ; odonoghue & charles 1996 ) , containing white dwarfs ( wd ) and bh compact objects respectively .",
    "it is very likely also to occur in ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ; e.g. x1916 - 053 ) where the donor itself is degenerate ( nelemans 2004 ) .",
    "and @xmath10 ( adapted from fig.7 in od01 , including only sources with known @xmath8 ) , where @xmath11 has units @xmath12 $ ] and q is dimensionless .",
    "the upper two lines ( solid & dashed ) correspond to the first two bending modes for @xmath13 ( mode 0 starting higher than mode 1 ) . sustained stable warps are only possible close to the solid portions of those curves , while warps become increasingly variable / unstable as the dashed curves are approached and crossed .",
    "the instability zone lies between these solid and dashed curves .",
    "the bottom solid line corresponds to mode 1 for @xmath14 , below which discs are unlikely to experience radiation - driven warping .",
    "the region between the bottom and top solid lines are considered an intermediate instability zone where a disc may display warping cycles as it alternates between being warped and being flat .",
    "squares indicate lmxbs and circles hmxbs .",
    "the grey vertical dashed line indicates the @xmath150.33 boundary ( whitehurst & king 1991 ) , to the left of which sources are susceptible to disc precession resulting from tidal interactions with the donor.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      this is the original superorbital mechanism that was proposed to account for the 35d cycle in her x-1 by petterson ( 1977 ) .",
    "subsequently developed by wijers and pringle ( 1999 ) , the most detailed analysis to date is that of od01 .",
    "they showed how accretion discs can develop radiation - induced warps that are functions of their binary separation ( @xmath11 ) and mass ratio ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the stability of such warps is defined in this analysis by the range of values for the mass input radius ( @xmath17 ) , with boundary values set by the circularization radius ( @xmath18 ) and the outer disc radius ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "( see fig.[od2001 ] for further details . )",
    "od01 ignored tidal torque and assumed a viscosity parameter ( @xmath20 ) and accretion efficiency ( @xmath10 ) that were considered reasonable for persistent x - ray binaries in general .",
    "it is expected that chaotic ( e.g. cyg x-2 ) or unstable ( e.g. smc x-1 ) warping may result in quasi - periodic superorbital variations , while precession of stable / sustained warps ( e.g. her x-1 & lmc x-4 ) should result in steady , almost strictly periodic superorbital modulations .",
    "pfeiffer & lai ( 2004 ) carried out numerical simulations of viscous accretion discs driven by the magnetic torque in the inner disc , resulting from the interaction between the induced electric currents in the disc and the accreting object s magnetic field ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "they show that an accretion disc surrounding a magnetic star ( t tauri star , wd or ns ) can develop warps in the inner disc that steadily precess .",
    "the retrograde precession as observed in her x-1 , is successfully reproduced by their simulations .",
    "they suggest that changes in @xmath22 can cause discs to switch between warped and flat .",
    "schandl & meyer ( 1994 ) proposed an alternative mechanism for the tilted disc observed for her x-1 , involving the coronal wind torque in combination with viscous and tidal torques , wherein the coronal wind exerts a repulsive force on the disc ( but see also the analysis and discussion concerning the coronal model in scott , leahy & wilson ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "quillen ( 2001 ) proposed that a supersonic wind passing over the accretion disc may cause surface instabilities .",
    "moreover , montgomery & martin ( 2010 ) suggest it may also cause lift due to the differing speeds above and below the disc , causing a pitch of the disc around its line of nodes , thereby tilting it .",
    "long - term modulation of the mass transfer rate ( @xmath22 ) through their discs has been associated with dramatic `` state changes '' in the x - ray spectra of many sources ( of which cyg x-1 and gx339 - 4 have provided frequent demonstrations ) .",
    "this is particularly true for the sxts ( mcclintock & remillard 2006 and references therein ) and luminous galactic bulge sources ( van der klis 2006 and references therein ) . in such cases ,",
    "the mass transfer rate is intermediate between the stable high and low spectral states , and so occasional transitions will occur .",
    "super - orbital periods detected in such systems may therefore indicate the time - scales associated with such transitions ( see e.g. king et al .",
    ".    quasi - persistent xrbs ( e.g. ks 1731 - 260 & x1636 - 536 ) can display prolonged high ( on ) and low ( off ) intervals , characterized by markedly different flux levels during those times ( charles et al .",
    "2008 ) . during the decline from the high to the low state",
    ", x1636 - 536 displayed an anti - correlation between the hard and soft x - rays as well as superorbital variations consistent with modulations of @xmath22 comparable with the viscous time - scale in the outer disc ( shih et al .",
    "2005 , 2011 ) .",
    "the archetypal galactic micro - quasar is the well - known ss433 ( hjellming & johnston 1981 ; margon 1984 ) , which displays the remarkable `` moving lines '' in its optical spectrum with radial velocities that are truly relativistic .",
    "these are now well - established as arising from precessing relativistic jets , a process which imparts substantial stability to the 162 d superorbital period .",
    "the jets and their corkscrew motion have been directly ( spatially ) observed at radio wavelengths ( blundell , bowler & schmidtobreick 2007 ) , although the detailed properties of the 13 d orbital period xrb at the heart of ss433 remain poorly determined ( e.g. barnes et al .",
    "the driving mechanism for the jet precession in ss433 is still a matter of controversy , but irradiation driven outflows are likely to play a significant role , as discussed in e.g. begelman et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "the most luminous lmxb in a galactic globular cluster is x1820 - 303 ( at the core of ngc 6624 ) . with close to the shortest orbital period ( @xmath012 mins ) , it should not be susceptible to radiation - induced disc warping as suggested by od01 .",
    "but its very low @xmath23 ( the donor is a very low mass degenerate helium dwarf ) , does make it a prime candidate for tidal disc precession effects .",
    "nevertheless , the extremely stable superorbital period which has been observed in x1820 - 303 is considered a likely consequence of the effect of a third body on the @xmath22 in the system ( chou & grindlay , 2001 ) .",
    "such triple systems involving an xrb have long been mooted , especially within the extremely dense stellar regions of globular cluster cores , but this system remains the strongest candidate .",
    "when a ns in a highly eccentric orbit passes through , or interacts with , the varying equatorial disc surrounding a rapidly rotating be - star , it naturally gives rise to a modulation at the orbital frequency ( see e.g. leahy & kostka 2008 and references therein , and hayasaki & okazaki 2006 ) . however , there are longer term variations in which the equatorial disc expands and contracts which will give rise to a modulation of the accreted fraction on this superorbital time - scale ( charles et al .",
    "these are the be x - ray binaries ( bex ) , which display a wide variety of variations at x - ray & optical wavelengths , extending to time - scales much longer than being considered here ( rajoelimanana , charles & udalski 2011 ) .",
    "periods are typically identified by applying a periodic analysis to the entire available dataset to produce a periodogram . while this approach allows one to distinguish between periodic ( sharp peaks ) and quasi - periodic ( broadened or multiple peaks ) behaviour , it is essentially limited to the identification ( not characterization ) of periodic signals ( wen et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "however , from our brief introduction to the variety of physical mechanisms that can induce superorbital variations , it will be clear that some of these can be intermittent , or vary in time - scale so much as to be rendered undetectable in a summed periodogram . consequently",
    ", such behaviour should be analysed in a way that displays the `` instantaneous '' modulations present in the data , and then follow this as a function of time .    a time - dependent periodic analysis of two hmxbs and two lmxbs in the form of dynamic power spectra ( dps ; e.g. clarkson et al . 2003 ) , clearly illustrated the need for a more comprehensive approach in the study of superorbital periods .",
    "therein the @xmath8 in smc x-1 was seen to evolve dramatically and systematically , while those in her x-1 and lmc x-4 remained essentially steady in period , although the modulation in her x-1 would occasionally disappear completely e.g. still et al .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath8 observed in cyg x-2 appeared to be highly variable and unstable .    the dps technique is well established and the x - ray burst community uses a variant of it routinely ( e.g. fig.19 in watts et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) .",
    "however , since it requires significantly more computations than the typical period analysis , its application was limited in the past .",
    "recent advances in desktop technology allow this technique to be employed more readily than before .",
    "another approach to unravel the time - dependence of these long - term periods was recently developed by hu et al .",
    "2011 , and this is the hilbert - huang transform ( hht ) .",
    "hu et al applied the hht to the same smc x-1 dataset as used here , and find that the hht is consistent with results obtained from the dps .",
    "they suggest that it may be able to show more detail in the frequency and time domains .",
    "boyd & smale ( 2004 ) applied time - frequency decomposition techniques to the long - term rxte asm lightcurves of three xrbs , separating them into random and periodic components .",
    "they suggest that all the @xmath8 modulations in cyg x-2 are integer multiples of its @xmath4 , although they concede that competing warping modes ( suggested in od01 ) could be considered as one of several mechanisms which may possibly be responsible for its long - term variations .      with an rxte observational baseline that has doubled",
    ", we revisit the 4 sources of clarkson et al .",
    "in addition , we apply the same analysis to the other 14 sources showing @xmath8 behaviour and summarised in charles et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . a further 7 sources ,",
    "not contained therein or published since , were also included in our target list .    here",
    "we present a time - resolved periodic analysis of all 25 sources with previously published or claimed @xmath241 yr , many of which have been inferred to be associated with warped and/or precessing accretion discs .",
    "consequently , we endeavour to provide a comprehensive overview of the long - term behaviour of the majority of superorbital modulations observed in x - ray binaries , through this systematic dps approach . in this way",
    "we hope that these results can provide a fresh context within which superorbital periods in x - ray binaries can be investigated .",
    "the 9 hmxbs and 16 lmxbs considered here are listed in tables [ hmxbs ] & [ lmxbs ] respectively , together with their previously published @xmath8 , @xmath4 and @xmath25 ( values of which are taken from od01 unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "their positions ( if known ) are shown on an adapted od01 plot ( fig.[od2001 ] ) of instability zones with respect to @xmath11 ( in units of @xmath12 $ ] ) and @xmath23 .",
    ".hmxbs with known superorbital periods [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +      a summary of all 25 sources is presented in table [ hmxbs ] & [ lmxbs ] for hmxbs and lmxbs respectively .",
    "therein , concise descriptions of the behaviour of their superorbital periods are given , together with the mechanisms believed to be responsible .",
    "relevant references regarding mechanisms are contained in the text under discussion of each source .",
    "the tables also include the source types included in the catalogue papers by liu , van paradijs & van den heuvel ( 2006,2007 ) .",
    "chaotic refers to unstable or highly variable periodic signals , like those displayed by cyg x-2 .",
    "varying includes evolution of persistent periodic signals ( like smc x-1 ) or intermittent periodic signals ( like x1636 - 536 ) .",
    "steady refers to persistent or intermittent periodic signals that display no significant variation ( like her x-1 & lmc x-4 ) , i.e. the variations are within conservative error estimates for the periods .",
    "this dps overview aims to provide the long awaited time - resolved analysis that od01 suggested would be required for aperiodic sources , as a basis for future investigations .",
    "an in - depth analysis of each source and detailed discussion of the full implications of these results , goes beyond the scope of this work . here",
    "we wish to highlight whether the results from our dps analysis suggest steady , evolving , persistent or unstable periods , and how they relate to previously published periods .    during the discussion of each source , we first compared the observed behaviour apparent from our analysis with the od01 predictions for stability of accretion discs against radiation - driven warping , since the od01 process has a dependence on system parameters ( determining an xrb s location on fig.[od2001 ] ) which allows its feasibility for superorbital varying systems as a class to be assessed .",
    "sources for which other mechanisms can account for the @xmath8 , were also compared to those predictions , where applicable .",
    "such mechanisms include tidal disc precession , precessing relativistic jets and @xmath22 variations due to a third body , state changes or variations in the size of the equatorial disc surrounding a be star donor .",
    "od01 predicted that only a small fraction of x - ray binaries should display steady superorbital periods associated with stable , steadily precessing , radiation - driven warped accretion discs .",
    "furthermore , they suggested that it would be even less common in lmxbs , since only those with @xmath261 d are expected to produce warps .",
    "however , 16 of the 25 sources contained herein are lmxbs . with 114 hmxbs and 187 lmxbs contained in the catalogues of liu ,",
    "van paradijs & van den heuvel ( 2006 , 2007 ) , it implies that superorbital periods have been detected in a slightly larger fraction of lmxbs than hmxbs .",
    "however , recent smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations by foulkes , haswell & murray ( 2010 ) on smc x-1 , cyg x-1 , cyg x-2 , x1916 - 053 , lmc x-3 , her x-1 , ss433 and a generalized lmxb , produced warps over all orbital periods considered .",
    "contrary to od01 , they predict that superorbital periods should be very common in lmxbs , suggesting that the analytical od01 approach is necessarily approximate and that the sph simulations should incorporate the complexities involved in an irradiated accretion disc more accurately as their `` disc continuously flexes in response to the changing orientation of the roche potential '' .",
    "it is important to remember that the od01 predictions for stability of accretion discs against radiation - driven warping , are for specific @xmath27 and @xmath28 values and that the instability criteria depend largely on @xmath27 and to a slightly lesser extent on @xmath28 , making the predictions approximate .",
    "different @xmath27 and @xmath28 values would yield very different predictions and these values are expected to differ from system to system .",
    "other mechanisms , such as wind - driven tilting and magnetic warping , may also produce warped / tilted accretions discs .",
    "furthermore , warps need to be sustained for prolonged intervals to produce steady superorbital periods ( as in her x-1 & lmc x-4 ) .",
    "lodato & price ( 2010 ) used sph simulations to consider the diffuse propagation of warps in viscous thin discs , where they determined the diffusion coefficient to be @xmath29 ( for small amplitude warps and @xmath300.1 ) , in general finding that higher viscosity leads to slower diffusion and lower viscosity to more rapid diffusion .",
    "of the 25 x - ray binaries considered here , 15 could be directly compared to their od01 predictions .",
    "the results are generally consistent with their predictions .",
    "firstly , our results support the od01 prediction that lmxbs are unlikely to produce stable precessing warped discs , since they are mostly located below the @xmath14 line and their accretion disks are therefore too small to become unstable against warping in the expected radiation field .",
    "her x-1 remains the only lmxb to have a steady superorbital period that can be associated with its accretion disc , since x1820 - 303 is likely a triple system .",
    "her x-1 is not a typical lmxb , since it has higher donor mass than most other lmxbs and therefore it might share some hmxb properties or be an intermediate - mass x - ray binary ( imxb ; see podsiadlowski , rappaport & han 2003 ) .",
    "one of these properties appears to be its ability to produce a warped precessing disc , with its associated steady superorbital period .",
    "secondly , od01 predictions implied that hmxbs are more likely to produce stable warped precessing discs , although eccentric orbits would suppresses stable radiation - driven warping .",
    "our dps analysis has shown that not only lmc x-4 displays a stable superorbital period , but also cyg x-1 , ss433 , x0114 + 650 & xte j1716 - 389 .",
    "only the locations of the latter two sources on fig.[od2001 ] are unknown .",
    "cyg x-1 , lmc x-4 & ss433 are located in the od01 instability zone and therefore expected to have warped precessing accretion discs that produce steady superorbital periods while they are persistent . however , the steady superorbital periods in ss433 and x0114 + 650 may have other origins , since the former experiences relativistic jet precession and the latter is a bex .",
    "thirdly , we included 5 quasi - persistent sources for which superorbital periods have been published .",
    "four of these are lmxbs ( x1636 - 536 , ks 1731 - 260 , exo 0748 - 676 & igr j17098 - 3628 ) and xte j1716 - 389 is the only hmxb .",
    "as od01 predicted , these quasi - persistent sources produce superorbital periods during their persistent ( high ) states , with the exception of x1636 - 536 , where stronger detections occurred during the lower state .",
    "its low state is certainly not an _ off _ state where the flux goes to zero , as seen in the other four sources .",
    "it also displayed an anti - correlation between hard and soft x - ray components ( shih et al . 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , only the hmxbs produced a relatively steady superorbital period while the lmxbs all produced multiple periodic signals that were either evolving or unstable / chaotic .",
    "finally , od01 predicted that sco x-1 would be marginally unstable or stable and show variability , since it is located in the intermediate instability zone .",
    "our results show long - term behaviour that may be interpreted in this manner .",
    "clarkson et al . ( 2003 ) suggested that warps may manifest themselves as modulations in the x - ray flux , not only resulting from variations in the accretion disc structure but also by modulation of @xmath22",
    ". varying absorption of x - rays from the central source by a warped inner disc or the variation in the uncovered x - ray emitting area apply to the former , while variation of the accretion rate onto the compact object or modulation of the mass flow rate through the disc ( dubus 2003 ) apply to the latter .",
    "it was also suggested that competing radiation - driven warping modes may cause variations in the warp itself , resulting in the steady evolution / variation of the @xmath8 in smc x-1 , consistent with its od01 prediction .",
    "her x-1 , with @xmath3133 - 37 d ( leahy & igna 2010 ) might be subject to the same effect , to a lesser extent .",
    "many of the superorbital periods already detected may be the result of the modulation of the @xmath22 , rather than only being associated with warped precessing accretion discs .",
    "many may therefore also indicate the time - scale on which transitions occur between high and low flux states .",
    "the hmxbs cen x-3 , cyg x-1 & lmc x-3 and the lmxb x1957 + 115 have very similar lightcurves that clearly show these transitions on varying time - scales .",
    "however , in the case of cyg x-1 there is also evidence for a precessing warped accretion disc ( zdziarski , pooley & skinner 2011 ) .",
    "in fact , the majority of the superorbital periods are clearly not steady , with many of those showing unsteady evolution of multiple periodic signals while they are persistent .",
    "such behaviour may also be associated with a variety of time - scales produced by @xmath22 variations .",
    "our results emphasize the importance of using a time - dependent periodic analysis approach such as dps when investigating the long - term periods that have been associated with accretion disc properties such as precession / warping / tilting and @xmath22 variations due to x - ray state changes .",
    "traditional period analysis , which use the entire datasets at one s disposal , would miss a source like ks 1731 - 260 since its overall periodogram shows no significant peaks .",
    "moreover , all the variations and complex behaviour of quasi - periodic signals go completely unnoticed .",
    "for example , the lightcurves of lmxbs x1730 - 333 & grs 1747 - 312 show some similarity to her x-1 , but their superorbital periods are not steady and appear to be evolving or varying .",
    "consequently it is not unexpected that studies of superorbital behaviour in hard x - rays ( 14 - 195 kev ) using data from the swift burst alert telescope and soft x - rays ( 1.5 - 12 kev ) using rxte asm data , found no significant periodic modulations for x1916 - 053 , cyg x-2 & sco x-1 , while being able to confirm the previously reported periods in x1820 - 303 & x1636 - 536 ( farrell , barret & skinner 2009 ) .",
    "unstable and/or intermittent periodic signals may lie below the white and/or red noise level when considering the longer datasets , while the time - dependent dps analysis shows intermittent and sustained periodic signals that appear to vary over time .",
    "since we are no longer limited by desktop technology , applying this analysis method to the other xrb sources contained in the rxte asm is relatively straightforward .",
    "it may reveal complex periodic behaviour that has thus far gone unnoticed .",
    "asm results were provided by the asm / rxte teams at mit and at the rxte science operations facility and guest observer facility at nasa s goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) .",
    "starlink s period package was used to produce all periodograms and window functions . all scripts to automate the analysis process were written in python .",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
    "alan levine for the use of his fortran program to obtain the white noise estimates for the significance test .",
    "we thank guillaume dubus for his comments and for pointing out the erroneous superorbital period associated with sco x-1 in od01 .",
