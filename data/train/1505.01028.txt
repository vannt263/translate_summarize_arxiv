    "the sm - like higgs boson discovered by the cms and atlas @xcite experiments at the lhc indicates a strong evidence for the proposed mechanism of the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) in the standard model ( sm )",
    ". however , further efforts are ongoing to test the characteristics of this newly observed particle against the sm higgs @xcite in terms of its properties and couplings to the sm particles .",
    "another important question is the ewsb behaves like what is predicted by the sm whether or no . to answer this question the higgs potential has to be examined up to higher order through measurements of higgs boson self - couplings which has many interesting phenomenological implications @xcite .",
    "one way to explore the higgs self - couplings is via measurements of the di - higgs and triple - higgs productions at the lhc and future planned hadron colliders @xcite .    on the other hand multiple higgs boson production",
    "also could be used to search for new physics especially in the high invariant mass region either for resonant or non - resonant possible physics beyond the sm . in the resonant case ,",
    "there are several interesting hypotheses which permit new resonance decaying to higgs pair such as randall - sundrum radion @xcite and cp - even heavy higgs in the next to minimal supersymmetric standard model(nmssm ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , there are already several studies to search for new physics through di - higgs final state which can be found in @xcite .    in the non - resonant searches ,",
    "a possibility is to use the di - higgs final state at the lhc and future circular colliders ( fcc ) to search for large extra dimensions in arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , dvali ( add ) scenario @xcite .",
    "they proposed the large extra dimension scenario as a solution for the hierarchy between the scale of electroweak and planck scale @xcite . according to their model , the sm fields",
    "are confined to the 3 + 1 space - time dimensions while gravity can freely propagate into the multi - dimensional space - time @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the possible number of extra dimensions .",
    "this leads to propagation of gravity field flux into the entire @xmath1 dimensions which leads to dilution of the power of gravity in the common 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the reduction of the gravitational flux can be quantified by applying the gausss law .",
    "the result expresses the relation between the ordinary fundamental planck scale @xmath3 in 3 + 1 common dimensions and planck scale in @xmath1 dimensions denoted by @xmath4 according to the following relation : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the size of extra dimensions . according to the add model motivation ,",
    "if one assumes the @xmath7 tev the size of extra dimensions for @xmath8 to 7 can be varied from few centimeters down to few femto - meters .",
    "based on the add scenario , many phenomenological studies have been preformed to find the possible observations in the particle colliders @xcite .",
    "in these works , graviton in the multi - dimensional representation equivalently interpreted as towers of massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes or @xmath9which can couple to the sm particles through sm energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the resulting effective model provides different experimental signatures such as virtual exchange of graviton and direct graviton emission at colliders .",
    "although the coupling of each kk mode @xmath9 with the sm gauge bosons or fermions is suppressed by the planck scale , the summation over all kk - modes with tiny mass splitting @xmath10 compensates for the suppression of planck scale .",
    "it is notable that such a mass scale is not observable by the current experiments due to very limited resolutions . in order to avoid of any divergency in the production cross sections arising from summation over the infinite number of kk modes ,",

    "the selection of the events is designed in such a way to find the @xmath54 events with subsequent decay of @xmath55 .    before going further ,",
    "one of the special characteristic of the signal events , which leads to employ particular strategies for events reconstruction and selection , is considered . in fig.[fig : dltar14 ] , the normalized distribution of @xmath56 is the angular separation of @xmath57 and @xmath58 quarks in the @xmath59 plane which is defined as : @xmath60 between two bottom quarks coming from the decay of each higgs boson for two samples of signal with @xmath61 tev and some backgrounds is shown . as it can be seen in fig.[fig : dltar14 ] , signal events tend to reside at very small values of @xmath56 contrary to the sm backgrounds .     between two bottom quarks coming from decay of each higgs for the two samples of signals and the potential backgrounds.[fig : dltar14 ] ]    in the events of signal with very large di - higgs invariant mass , higgs bosons are lorentz - boosted particles which decay differently from the topological point of view compared to the higgs bosons which are produced almost at rest .",
    "the angular separation of a @xmath0 pair coming from a higgs boson can be approximated as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the transverse momentum of the higgs boson , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the momentum fractions of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 quarks .",
    "the larger higgs @xmath63 the smaller angular separation of @xmath0 pair .",
    "figure [ fig : deltarpt ] shows two dimensional plots of @xmath66 versus the higgs boson @xmath63 and the hardest @xmath57 quark @xmath63 in a higgs boson decay for the sm process of @xmath67 .",
    "the plots of figure [ fig : deltarpt ] confirm that as we go to the boosted region ( events with large transverse momentum of higgs or large transverse momentum of b quark ) , the @xmath66 decreases .",
    "it means that the boosted higgs bosons produce one collimated jet with substructure .",
    "this can originate from two reasons : first is that the decaying higgs boson has an energy several times larger than the higgs boson mass in the laboratory frame and second reason is the difference between the mass of higgs and b quark is large .    as the di - higgs invariant mass is an important quantity which will be used to separate add signal events from the backgrounds , @xmath66 is also presented versus the di - higgs invariant mass for signal and sm di - higgs events in figure [ fig : invdeltar ] .",
    "obviously , the add signal events prefer to be distributed in the large invariant mass region of the di - higgs system which is not the case for the sm di - higgs events .",
    "another observation from the figure [ fig : invdeltar ] is that with increasing the di - higgs mass of the signal events , @xmath66 decreases and falls even below 0.4 .",
    "more accurately , the sm di - higgs events are distributed at di - higgs invariant mass smaller than 1 tev and peak at @xmath68 while for the signal , di - higgs invariant mass peak at values greater than 3 tev and around @xmath69 .     for the sm di - higgs events .",

    "the first category consists of higgs boson pairs which are produced near the threshold . in this type of events ( normal events ) ,",
    "each parton is matched to a single jet . in the second category ,",
    "higgs bosons are produced with a large lorentz boost , resulting in collimated jets that might cluster into one jet .",
    "these events are referred as boosted events which need to be treated differently from the normal events .      as it has been mentioned previously , reconstruction of b - jets specially for the signal events due to the existence of highly boosted higgs bosons are crucial .",
    "according to eq.[eq : deltar ] if the higgs bosons have transverse momentum larger than @xmath71 and if approximately both b - jets carry the same fractions of the higgs boson momentum , the angular separation between two b - jets is @xmath72 . as a consequence , common jet reconstruction which",
    "usually is done with the cone size of @xmath73 would not be applicable for the most of signal events .",
    "therefore , an alternative way of fat jet algorithm is used @xcite for these boosted events .",
    "now , the jet substructure analysis is described together with its application on our signal with four boosted b - jets in the final state .",
    "we reconstruct the fat jets using the cambridge / aachen ( ca ) jet algorithm @xcite assuming special jet cone size of @xmath74 . then to identify the boosted higgs bosons , the procedures described in the fat jet reconstruction algorithm @xcite",
    "is performed as the following .",
    "first , large radius or a fat jet @xmath75 is split into two sub - jets @xmath76 and @xmath77 with masses @xmath78 .",

    "@xmath81 is an arbitrary value that shows the degree of the mass drop . in order to avoid the inclusion of high @xmath63 light jets , two sub - jets have to be symmetrically split by satisfying : @xmath82 where @xmath83and @xmath84 are the square of the transverse momentum of each sub - jet and @xmath85 is one of the parameters of the algorithms which determines the limit of asymmetry between two sub - jets . finally ,",
    "if the criteria in the above steps are not fulfilled , we take @xmath86 and return to the first step to perform decomposition .",
    "all the above steps are followed by a filtering in which a re - clustering is performed with the radius of @xmath87 which selects at most three hardest jets .",
    "this is a useful step to remove the contributions from pileup and underlying events @xcite . in the analysis ,",
    "the two hardest objects are required to be tagged as b - jets while the third one can be possible radiation of the two b quarks .",
    "it has been shown the best values for the algorithm parameter are @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite and the best performance for clustering when it deals with jet substructure is c / a algorithm .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that tighter value of @xmath81 would not be useful significantly @xcite .",
    "the algorithm explained above for reconstruction of the boosted objects has been implemented in the fastjet3.1.1 package @xcite using that we perform the analysis to find the two higgs bosons in the final state .    in this analysis ,",
    "first the jets coming from signal or backgrounds are reconstructed with the anti-@xmath90 algorithm with the cone size of @xmath91 then if two jets with @xmath92 gev are found in the event , the fat jet algorithm is applied .",

    "is assumed .",

    "figure [ fig : rapiditygap ] shows of @xmath130 for main sm background di - higgs and the add signal with @xmath131 tev . considering only the sm di - higgs as the main background",
    ", we set a limit on the add parameter using this angular distribution .",
    "we perform the analysis with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath106 .",
    "we define a @xmath98 over the @xmath132 distribution as :    @xmath133    where the numerator shows the square number of signals and @xmath134 and @xmath135 represent the statistical and systematical uncertainties . to calculate the @xmath98 , we use the same event selections as before and we consider the events in the signal region which is determined in the previous section . figure [ fig : chisquare ] shows the @xmath136 as a function of @xmath40 , where @xmath137 indicates the number of degree of freedom . the dashed - line shows the value of @xmath136 which corresponds to the @xmath23 cl . the limit on @xmath40 using this observable is found to be 6.98 tev which is higher than the value that we obtained using the invariant mass . to check the effect of systematic uncertainties",
    ", we considered @xmath138 and @xmath139 overall systematic uncertainties which are shown as dashed lines .",
    "including @xmath139 systematic uncertainty leads to loosen the limit on @xmath40 around 200 gev .",
    "a significant improvement could be achieved using the distribution of the rapidity gap of two - higgs bosons which amounts to around 1.8 tev with respect to the mass spectrum analysis of di - higgs .     for the add signal events and sm di - higgs production at parton level.[fig : rapiditygap ] ]    this leads to conclude that the di - higgs final state would be a promising channel to search for the large extra dimension effects at the hadron colliders .",
    "in particular , the usage of angular distribution would lead to stringent bounds on the model parameters .     as a function of @xmath40 , where @xmath137 represents the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the dashed line shows the value of @xmath136 which corresponds to the @xmath23 cl.[fig : chisquare ] ]",
    "double higgs boson production at hadron colliders provides the possibility to probe not only the higgs self - coupling and higgs couplings with the sm particles but also it enables us to search for the effects of new physics beyond the sm . in this paper , the double higgs production at the lhc and future circular collider ( fcc ) with the center - of - mass energies of 14 tev , 33 tev , and 100 tev is used to search for the effects of large extra dimensions . the analysis is only based on the most probable final state i.e. @xmath140 which is of course a challenging channel due to large qcd background and triggering the events .",
    "the tail of the invariant mass of the two higgs bosons is affected due to the virtual gravitons exchange .",
    "in addition to the di - higgs invariant mass , the angular distributions of the final state higgs bosons ( and consequently the decay products ) have a quite different behavior with respect to the sm irreducible background due to the exchange of spin 2 gravitons .",
    "we perform a comprehensive monte - carlo simulation analysis taking into account the main backgrounds and consider a cms - like detector effects using the delphes package . to reconstruct the signal candidate events efficiently and reasonable background rejection , jet substructure techniques are employed to capture the signal events which are boosted objects in the final state",
    ". then we obtain the expected limits on the model parameters using the invariant mass and the angular properties of the final state particles .",
    "depending on the number of extra dimensions , the effective planck scale is limited up to 6.1 , 12.5 , 28.1 tev at the proton - proton collisions with the center - of - mass energies of 14 , 33 , and 100 tev , respectively .",
    "further improvement of the analysis is possible by including other decay modes of the higgs bosons such as @xmath141 .",
