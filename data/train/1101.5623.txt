    "in a recent publication , johari and khouri @xcite used upper and lower bounds on the isobaric entropy @xmath0 of a glass as a function of the temperature @xmath1 of the surrounding medium , obtained by using the measured heat capacity during cooling and heating to argue for the reality of the residual entropy @xmath2 , as the latter has become a highly debated issue in the literature.@xcite for a brief review of the history of the residual entropy and the current controversy , we refer the reader to goldstein,@xcite gutzow and schmelzer,@xcite nemilov,@xcite and the recent reviews@xcite by us ; see also below .",
    "the existence of a non - zero residual entropy ( @xmath3 ) is very common in nature , and does not violate nernst s postulate , as the latter is applicable only to equilibrium states with a _ non - degenerate _ ground state ; see sect .",
    "64 in landau and lifshitz.@xcite its existence was first theoretically demonstrated by pauling and tolman;@xcite see also tolman .",
    "@xcite in addition , the existence of the residual entropy has been demonstrated rigorously for a very general spin model by chow and wu.@xcite the residual entropy for glycerol was observed by gibson and giauque@xcite and for ice by giauque and ashley.@xcite pauling @xcite provided the first numerical estimate for the residual entropy for ice , which was later improved by nagle.@xcite nagle s numerical estimate has been recently verified by simulation.@xcite the numerical simulation carried out by bowles and speedy@xcite for glassy dimers also supports the existence of a residual entropy .",
    "richet @xcite uses the adam - gibbs theory to justify the residual entropy .",
    "thus , it appears that the support in favor of the residual entropy is quite strong .",
    "we wish to emphasize that what is customarily called the third law due to nernst , according to which the entropy must vanish at absolute zero , is merely a postulate and not a strict theorem even in equilibrium.@xcite indeed , many exactly solved statistical mechanical models show a non - zero entropy at absolute zero .",
    "however , as of yet , no experiment can be performed at absolute zero to demonstrate the residual entropy ; in all cases , some sort of _ extrapolation _ is required .",
    "this point should not be forgotten in the following whenever we speak of measuring the residual entropy .",
    "in addition , we will speak of the equilibrium state associated with a non - equilibrium state . depending on the context",
    ", the equilibrium state may represent a true equilibrium state such as a crystal or a ( time - independent ) metastable state such as the supercooled liquid .",
    "however , for the purpose of clarity , we will consider the supercooled liquid in the following , but the arguments are applicable to both cases .",
    "it is surprising to see this controversy persist in the current literature even though it seemed resolved a long time ago;@xcite we also note somewhat recent attempts.@xcite the controversial issue is the following : as the irreversibility does not allow for an exact evaluation of the entropy , is it possible for the entropy to decrease by an amount almost equal to @xmath2 within the glass transition region so that the glass ( see glass2 in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] ) would have a vanishing entropy at absolute zero ?",
    "the entropy for glass2 follows from the recent proposals by kivelson and reiss,@xcite and by gupta and mauro;@xcite see also reiss.@xcite gupta and mauro@xcite conclude that @xmath4  at and below the glass transition , in conformity with glass2 .",
    "they actually state the above inequality at the glass transition in eq .",
    "( 10 ) of the above paper but then take it to be also valid below the transition",
    ". their conclusion is based on the fact that @xmath5 for the gibbs free energies and the equality @xmath6 of the enthalpy at the glass transition ; here @xmath7 and @xmath8 refer to the glass and @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to the supercooled liquid .",
    "the equality @xmath6 is widely accepted as an experimental fact in the field.@xcite the motivation for their proposal is their understanding@xcite that the entropy of a single sample of glass at absolute zero must be zero as the microstate of the sample will not change no matter how long the glass is `` observed . ''",
    "thus , according to this view , the entropy is not merely less than that of glass1 , such as glass3 , it must be strictly less than or equal to @xmath11 .",
    "the alternative shown as glass3@xmath12 is not consistent with this view.@xcite    [ ptb ]    fig_entropyglass_goldstein_new.eps    according to eq .",
    "( [ gm_bound ] ) , the entropy of a glass can only increase during relaxation as the glass strives to equilibrate at any temperature below the glass transition . what could be wrong with such a simple deduction , which does not require any sophisticated mathematics ?",
    "gutzow and schmelzer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the discussion following their eq .",
    "( 39 ) ) also come to the same conclusion . on the other hand ,",
    "the common view of the glass is shown by glass1 in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] , with the clear implication that the entropy of the glass is higher than that of the supercooled liquid .",
    "there is at present no consensus as is evident from the discussion reported in the proceedings,@xcite and the general conclusion drawn by goldstein@xcite that the abrupt entropy loss comparable to @xmath2 as proposed by kivelson and reiss@xcite will result in the construction of a perpetual motion machine of the second kind .",
    "goldstein merely follows the consequence of the existence of a possible reversible connection between a glass and the supercooled liquid as proposed by kivelson and reiss . in view of the simple observation in eq .",
    "( [ gm_bound ] ) , one can argue that the general demonstration by goldstein is either inapplicable to a glass or that the basic premise of a possible existence of a reversible connection between a glass and the supercooled liquid using kivelson - reiss construction must be invalid .",
    "indeed , gupta and mauro@xcite argue that the second law does not apply to the glass transition proposed by them as the loss of entropy in their formulation does not result in a latent heat , while goldstein s general demonstration noted above depends crucially on this heat and , therefore , does not invalidate the proposal of a discontinuous loss by gupta and mauro although it does invalidate the proposal by kivelson and reiss .",
    "one can also argue that the special `` electrode '' construction proposed by kivelson and reiss , and used by goldstein , requires _",
    "microscopic _ information to confine the system into a _ unique _ basin , a configurational microstate , in that one needs to know precisely where _ each _ particle of the system is located within a certain small volume cell associated with its possible vibrations;@xcite see gujrati@xcite for elaboration on microstate measurements .",
    "oppenheim@xcite has also raised somewhat of a similar objection .",
    "in addition , it is not obvious that thermodynamics , which is a description of a macrostate , can be applicable to a microstate such as the one obtained by the above special construction .",
    "mauro et al@xcite also consider a glass formed by continuous cooling such as glass2 in which the entropy is lost continuously .",
    "it should be noted that goldstein@xcite does not explicitly discuss continuous cooling ; however , in a private discussion , goldstein has pointed out that his demonstration based on solubility also covers continuous cooling .",
    "the amount of loss in this case is not going to be close to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , goldstein s argument will not only invalidate glass2 but also glass3 .",
    "despite all these attempts , the situation remains confusing , in part because , to quote goldstein@xcite[goldstein - quote ] : `` as the residual entropies found by calorimetric measurements either equal or at least do not exceed the calculated value .... , it is generally though not unanimously accepted that the residual entropies are real . ''",
    "thus , in these cases , as already pointed out by bestul and chang,@xcite one `` ... can not demonstrate ... ''",
    "whether the residual entropy `` ... differs from zero . '' of course",
    ", the attempts so far by those who believe in the residual entropy,@xcite have been only to demonstrate that the residual entropy is _ approximately _ equal to the calculated value , to be denoted here by @xmath13 , within a few percentages ; however , as they do not deal directly with @xmath11 ,  they have not ruled out the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ gm_bound ] ) .",
    "even though no experiments have revealed a situation in which @xmath13 lies below @xmath14 over the temperature range where the latter has been experimentally determined , the above calorimetric studies make no claim that @xmath15 for all temperatures below the glass transition , even though many workers believe it to be intuitively true . in light of eq .",
    "( [ gm_bound ] ) , however , t is possible that the above inequality turns out to be incorrect .",
    "the contribution of goldstein@xcite only proves that an abrupt or a continuous loss of a part of the residual entropy ( @xmath16 ) can not be valid , but it neither rules out zero residual entropy nor the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ gm_bound ] )",
    ". it also says nothing about the above inequality .",
    "is it possible that the demonstration of @xmath17 itself is invalid ?",
    "however , we can not find any discussion of it in the current literature .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the controversy still persists .",
    "goldstein@xcite has suggested that the entropy loss proposal `` ... may be impossible to verify by any conceivable experiment , ... '' thus leaving the possibility that some theoretical approach , such as the one to be taken here , may resolve the issue .",
    "a theoretical approach will also allow us to investigate the inequalties in eqs .",
    "( [ gm_bound]-[experiment_scl_bound ] ) at absolute zero , where experiments can not be performed .",
    "johari and khouri@xcite have analyzed data from a large number of glasses to draw the conclusion that a non - zero residual entropy is real in the cases they have analyzed .",
    "the idea behind their discussion is simple : the bounds , called the clausius limits , @xcite on the ( thermodynamic ) entropy reflect the contributions of irreversibility in the experimentally determined estimate @xmath13 of the entropy @xmath0 .",
    "they find that the two bounds are so tight in most cases ( less than 2% ) that one can neglect the corrections to the calorimetrically determined @xmath13 due to irreversibility along cooling and heating paths , a conclusion arrived at by several others.@xcite it appears that this approach was first used by bestul and chang @xcite and later by sethna and coworkers.@xcite .",
    "johari and khouri finally conclude that the experimental evidence of a non - zero residual entropy ( see glass1 in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] ) is beyond reproach for the systems they have analyzed .",
    "the implication of their contribution and of several others mentioned above@xcite is that there is no thermodynamic reason , such as the third law , for the residual entropy to be zero , a conclusion well known in theoretical physics.@xcite we should mention at this point that if there is ever any _ conflict _ between the second law @xcite and any other law in physics such as the zeroth or the third law for a macroscopic body , it is the second law that is believed to hold in _ all _ cases .",
    "this suggests that glass2 does not materialize for the systems considered by johari and khouri .",
    "@xcite      we wish to prove in this work that glass2 can not materialize for any system .",
    "as far as glass3 is concerned , we will establish that it may represent an approximation for glass1 , but can not represent a real glass .",
    "therefore , we will mostly consider glass1 and glass2 in the following . to fulfill this goal",
    ", we have to go beyond the calorimetric evidence@xcite for the residual entropy .",
    "we treat the two glasses in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] basically as two separate _ proposals _ for the general behavior of glasses .",
    "therefore , they need to be demonstrated to be valid or invalid in _ all _ cases , without a single exception . to obtain such a general result",
    ", we must not _ make _ any assumptions or approximations ; the latter would mean that the conclusion could not be valid in all cases ; see below .",
    "we must also not rely upon heuristic or intuitive arguments as part of the proof . as the exact values of the entropy require detailed information about the system , it in not feasible to find the two entropies exactly for all systems .",
    "thus , we will not be interested in system - specific knowledge ; rather , we want mathematically sound conclusions about the entropy that will be valid for all glass formers _ without exception_. because the controversy is between two inequalities , any approximation would turn the strict inequality such as @xmath18 into @xmath19 . in that case , we may have @xmath20 in some cases depending on how far @xmath21 is from @xmath22 . unfortunately , various discussions@xcite in favor of the residual entropy and the specific critique by goldstein@xcite using solubility either use approximations ( such as replacing the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ residual_entropy_determination ] ) below by an equality ) or are phenomenological with a limited domain of validity .",
    "indeed , gutzow and schmelzer@xcite have come to the conclusion ( see above eq .",
    "( 40 ) there ) that in any real process , the entropy either remains constant or increases .",
    "the conclusion is in accordance with eq .",
    "[ gm_bound ] .",
    "thus , the current status of the field leaves open the possibility that the residual entropy could vanish .",
    "it is abundantly clear from the above discussion that there is a need to look at the issue of residual entropy once again . in our opinion , the real issue is the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ gm_bound ] ) , whose validity has not been scrutinized in the literature .",
    "if the bound is jusitified , it automatically proves that @xmath2 is not real .",
    "if , on the other hand , the bound is not justified , it does not automatically prove that @xmath2 is real .",
    "we then have the additional task to prove its reality .",
    "as is customary , we treat the supercooled liquid as an equilibrium state , even though it not a true equilibrium state ; see above .",
    "we proceed by following the strict second law inequality @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ second_law_inequality ] ) and use it along with the existence of internal equilibrium@xcite ( for theorem [ theorem_entropy_variation ] ) to prove the following two theorems applicable to _ all _ non - equilibrium systems , regardless of how close or far they are from their equilibrium state .",
    "[ theorem_lower_bound]the experimentally observed non - zero entropy at absolute zero in a vitrification process is a _ strict lower bound of the residual entropy _ of any system : @xmath24    [ theorem_entropy_variation]any drop of the glass entropy below that of the supercooled liquid ( such as glass2 in fig .",

    "[ fig_entropyglass ] .    our conclusion in eq .",

    "( [ residualentropy_bound]-[glassentropy_bound ] ) without any exception .",
    "this is the meaning behind the usage of `` ... rigorous ... '' in the title of the paper .",
    "the actual values of the entropy are not relevant for the aim of this work , which is to settle the controversy between glass1 and glass2 under vitrification and the way their entropies relate to that of the equilibrated supercooled liquid . because of the possibility that the systems may be far away from equilibrium , where the irreversible contributions may not be neglected , our results go beyond the previous calorimetric evidence.@xcite the systems we are interested in include glasses and imperfect crystals as special cases .",
    "however , to be specific , we will only consider glasses below ; the discussion is valid for all non - equilibrium systems .",
    "we hope that the proofs of the above two theorems settle the controversy between the two forms of glasses and about the residual entropy @xmath2 .",
    "we first consider the behavior of the thermodynamic entropy that appears in classical non - equilibrium thermodynamics . as is well known , this entropy is governed by the second law.@xcite in the next section , we prove theorem [ theorem_lower_bound ] . in the following section , we prove theorem [ theorem_entropy_variation ]",
