    "blazars are a very active class of active galactic nuclei , consisting of optically violently variable quasars , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacertae objects . in some cases ,",
    "their emission lines are very weak or absent ( equivalent width @xmath0 5@xmath1 ) , a property which classically was used to define the bl lacertae objects ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ; marcha et al .",
    "other blazars have broad emission lines similar to those of normal quasars .",
    "they have been observed at all wavelengths , from radio through very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath2-rays .",
    "blazars exhibit variability at all wavelengths on various timescales .",
    "the high inferred isotropic luminosities and apparent superluminal motion revealed by long baseline radio interferometry provide conclusive evidence that blazars are sources with relativistic jets oriented close to our line of sight and their emission is highly beamed and doppler boosted in the forward direction .",
    "the overall emission , from radio to @xmath2-rays shows the presence of two well - defined broad components ( von montigny et al .  1995 ; fossati et al .",
    "the dominant emission mechanisms in all classes of blazars is most likely synchrotron emission from radio to uv / soft x - ray frequencies and inverse compton scattering for hard x - ray and gamma ray energies .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of lsps ( low synchrotron frequency peaked bl lacs ) and hsps ( high synchrotron frequency peaked bl lacs ) are systematically different , with the observed peak of the emitted power typically at nir / optical wavelengths for lsps and at uv / soft x - ray wavelengths for hsps ( giommi , ansari & micol 1995 ) .",
    "one can define the objects as lsps or hsps if their ratio of x - ray flux in the 0.3 - 3.5 kev band to radio flux density at 5 ghz is smaller than or larger than @xmath3 , respectively ( padovani & giommi 1996 ) .",
    "however , sed peaks can be located at intermediate frequencies as well , giving rise to the intermediate synchtrotron peaked blazar ( isp ) classification ( sambruna , maraschi & urry 1996 ) .",
    "nieppola , tornikoski & valtaoja ( 2006 ) classify over 300 bl lacs and suggest that blazars with energy peak frequency , @xmath4 hz are lsps , those with @xmath5 hz are isps and those with @xmath6 hz are hsps .",
    "recently , abdo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) extended the definition to all types of non - thermal dominated agns depending on the peak frequency of their synchrotron hump , @xmath7 , and suggest the following classification : low - synchrotron - peaked ( lsp ) sources , with @xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath9 hz ; intermediate - synchrotron peaked ( isp ) sources , with 10@xmath9 @xmath0@xmath7 @xmath0 10@xmath10 hz ; and high - synchrotron - peaked ( hsp ) sources , with @xmath7 @xmath11 10@xmath10 hz ; however , we have used the broader definition of isps put forward by nieppola et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "optical observations offer a wealth of information on the variability of blazars and play an important role in discriminating between lsps and hsps .",
    "differences in the optical spectral properties of lsps and hsps constrain the theoretical models that try to explain the spectra and variability of these blazars .",
    "the study of sed properties is an excellent diagnostic tool for theoretical models and for the understanding of the physical radiation mechanisms , as these studies are crucial in analzing individual emission components . with respect to the optical spectrum of blazars , for hsps",
    ", the maximum is located at higher frequencies and so the optical emission is in the ascending part of the synchrotron emission hump , while for lsps the optical emission is expected to be in the descending part of this portion of the sed .",
    "thus we expect for hsps that the radio - through - x - ray spectral index @xmath12 is less than or equal to 0.75 or 0.80 , while for lsps , it is greater than 0.75 ( urry & padovani 1995 ) or 0.80 , whereas for isps , 0.7@xmath13 @xmath12 @xmath130.8 ( sambruna , maraschi & urry 1996 ) .",
    "although the optical band is very narrow with respect to other spectral bands , it may yield a large amount of information , as it can indicate the possible presence of other components in addition to the synchrotron continuum .",
    "for example , thermal emission from the accretion disk around the central engine is an important physical component , while the emission from the surrounding region of the nucleus and the host galaxy contribution are fundamentally contaminants .",
    "the synchrotron inverse - compton emission model predicts that the spectrum gets harder as the source turns brighter and several investigators indeed found that the optical spectrum became flatter when the flux increased , while the spectrum became steeper when the flux decreased ( e.g. , gear , robson & brown 1986 ; maesano et al .",
    "however , ghosh et al .  ( 2000 ) suggested that this might not be always correct .",
    "trevese & vagnetti ( 2002 ) analyzed the spectral slope variability of 42 pg quasars and concluded that the spectral variability must be intrinsic to the nuclear component .",
    "vagnetti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the spectral variability , even restricted to the optical band , could be used to set limits on the relative contribution of the synchrotron component and the thermal component .    here",
    "we report the optical observations of 11 blazars on intra - day variability ( idv ) and short - term variability ( stv , from days through months ) timescales during the 20092011 observing seasons .",
    "we also searched for colour variations in these blazars on intra - day and short term timescales .",
    "in addition , we analyzed the main features of the optical spectra for our sample of blazars .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the observations and data reduction procedure , including our approaches to variability and time - scale detection .",
    "section 3 provides our results of idv , stv and colour variability of our sample of blazars .",
    "section 4 gives the general characteristics of the optical spectra .",
    "section 5 provides the results of flux , colour and spectral variability of these sources and we have presented our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "observations of these blazars were performed using six optical telescopes , four in bulgaria , one in greece and one in india .",
    "all of these telescopes are equipped with ccd detectors and johnson ubv and cousins ri filters .",
    "details of five of these telescopes , detectors and other parameters related to the observations are given in table 1 of gaur et al .",
    "( 2012b ) and a description of the remaining telescope is given in table 1 .",
    "a complete log of observations of these blazars from those six telescopes are given in table 2 .",
    "although we have observed 13 blazars as part of this study , for our analyses of stv and colour variations , we used only 11 blazars , since the blazars j0211 + 1051 and 1es 0806 + 524 were each only observed on 4 nights .",
    "we carried out optical photometric observations during the period 2009 - 2011 .",
    "the raw photometric data were processed by standard methods .",
    "image processing or pre - processing was done using standard routines in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) and eso - midas softwares .",
    "we processed the data using the dominion astrophysical observatory photometry ( daophot ii ) software to perform the circular concentric aperture photometric technique ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) . for each night",
    "we carried out aperture photometry with four different aperture radii , i.e. , 1@xmath14fwhm , 2@xmath14fwhm , 3@xmath14fwhm and 4@xmath14fwhm .",
    "on comparing the photometric results we found that aperture radii of 2@xmath14fwhm almost always provided the best s / n ratio , so we adopted that aperture for our final results .    for these blazars , we observed three or more local standard stars on the same fields .",
    "we employed two standard stars from each blazar field with magnitudes similar to those of the target and plotted their differential instrumental magnitudes for the idv light curves .",
    "as the fluxes of the blazars and the standard stars were obtained simultaneously and so at the same air mass and with identical instrumental and weather conditions , the flux ratios are considered to be very reliable . finally , to calibrate the photometry of the blazars , we used the one standard star that had a colour closer to that of the blazar .      to search for and describe blazar variability",
    "we have employed two quantities commonly used in the literature .",
    "the variability detection parameter , @xmath15 was introduced by romero et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and is defined as the average of @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the differential instrumental magnitudes of the blazar and standard star a and the blazar and standard star b , respectively , while @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the observational scatters of the differential instrumental magnitudes of the blazar and star a , the blazar and star b and stara and star b , respectively . if @xmath24 , the nominal confidence level of a variability detection is @xmath25% . however , this @xmath15-test is not a true statistic as it is not appropriately distributed and this criterion is usually too conservative ( de diego 2010 ) .",
    "we test our results for variability using the standard @xmath26-test , which is a properly distributed statistic ( de diego 2010 ) . given two sample variances such as s@xmath27 for the blazar instrumental light curve measurements and s@xmath28 for that of the standard star , then @xmath29    the number of degrees of freedom for each sample , @xmath30 and @xmath31 will be the same and equal to the number of measurements , n , minus 1 ( @xmath32 n @xmath33 1 ) . the @xmath26 value",
    "is then compared with the @xmath34 critical value , where @xmath35 is the significance level set for the test .",
    "the smaller the @xmath35 value , the more improbable that the result is produced by chance . if @xmath26 is larger than the critical value , the null hypothesis ( no variability ) is discarded .",
    "we have performed @xmath26-tests at two significance levels ( 0.1% and 1% ) which correspond to 3@xmath36 and 2.6@xmath36 detections , respectively .",
    "the structure function ( sf ) is a useful tool to make preliminary estimates of any periodicities and timescales in time - series data and is able to discern the range of the characteristic timescales that contribute to the fluctuations . for details about how we used the sf see gaur et al .",
    "emmanoulopoulos et al .  (",
    "2010 ) have discussed the weaknesses of the sf method , so we have cross checked our sf results by the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) method .",
    "the dcf is analogous to the classical correlation function which requires evenly sampled data except that it can work with unevenly sampled data .",
    "it was introduced by edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) .",
    "hufnagel & bregman ( 1992 ) generalized the method to include a better error estimate . for details about the dcf see tonnikoski et al .",

    "the substantial flux variations for optical idv and stv in blazars can be reasonably explained by models involving relativistic shocks propagating outwards ( e.g. marscher & gear 1985 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ; marscher et al .",
    "1996 ) , although most of the idv in the radio band comes from interstellar scattering .",
    "the larger flares are expected to be produced by the emergence and motion of a new shock triggered by some strong variations in a physical quantity such as velocity , electron density or magnetic field moving into and through the relativistic jet .",
    "idv reported in the blazars is generally attributed to the shock moving down the inhomogeneous medium in the jet . in ao 0235@xmath40164 , gravitational microlensing ( e.g.  gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 )",

    "phenomena that could lead to colour variations with time were summarized by hawkins ( 2002 ) who noted they could arise from : colour changes in accretion discs ; different contributions from the underlying host galaxy arising from changes in seeing ; and colour changes from microlensing .",
    "colour variations in these sources are most unlikely to arise from the underlying host galaxy , as in the case of bl lacs , doppler boosed jet emission almost invariably swamps the light from the host galaxy .",
    "also , bl lacs seem to have much weaker disc emission , so colour changes arising in the accretion disc are also unlikely .",
    "ao 0235@xmath40164 showed significant colour variations and is known to have two foreground galaxies at @xmath74 = 0.524 and @xmath74 = 0.851 ( nilsson et al .",
    "1996 ) so colour variations seen in this source could arise from microlensing of different regions within a relativistic jet ( gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 ) . in the case of bl lacs ,",
    "any accretion disc radiation is always overwhelmed by that from the jet , and therefore jet models that can produce different fluctuations in different colours are most likely to be able to explain the colour variations we have detected . in the usual models involving shocks propagating down the jets ( e.g. marscher & gear 1985 ; marscher et al .",
    "2008 ) , radiation at different frequencies is produced at different distances behind the shocks .",
    "higher frequency photons from the synchrotron component emerge sooner and closer to the shock front .",
    "hence colour variations in blazars could arise from differences in the times and rates at which radiation observed at different visible colours rise and fall .",
    "we now investigate the relationship between spectral changes and flux variations on short - term as well as intra - day time scales . on short time",

    "the variations of the colour indices of our bl lac objects follow this trend .",
    "it is possible to explain this colour variation with a one - component synchrotron model , i.e. , the more intense the energy release , the higher the typical particle s energy and the higher the corresponding frequency ( fiorucci et al .",

    "however , some evidence that the amplitudes of variations are not systematically larger at high frequencies has been found on several occasions ( brown et al .",

    "2000 ; ramirez et al .",
    "ghosh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that it may not be correct to generalize that the amplitude of the variation in blazars is systematically larger at higher frequency as they found a reddening as the brightness increases in their optical observations of the bl lac objects pks 0735@xmath40178 , 3c 66a and ao 0235@xmath40164 .",
    "the trend of steeper spectra when brighter seems to generally hold for the variations we saw in idv . on intra - day timescales ,",
    "1es 1426@xmath40428 and 1es 1553@xmath40113 ( during one night ) showed significant negative correlations between colour index and magnitude .",

    "chiang & bttcher ( 2002 ) demonstrate that for a broad range of particle injection distributions , ssc - loss - dominated synchrotron emission exhibits exactly this kind of spectral slope . hence , ssc models fit the optical emission for lsps very well .",
    "+ * fsrqs *    since fsrqs are a subclass of lsps , we expect the optical spectral index also should be greater than 1",
    ". however , fsrqs show strong emission lines and a thermal contribution that may be comparable to the synchrotron emission in the optical spectral region . the optical emission of fsrqs is often strongly contaminated by thermal emission from the accretion disk and it is shown by the presence of the  big blue bump \" in the optical / uv region .",
    "this contribution was clearly shown in the sed of 3c 273 by trler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and the mean optical spectral slope was calculated to be 0.6 by fiorucci et al .",
    "however , for other two sources , 3c 454.3 and 3c 279 , the spectral slopes are 1.47 and 1.13 respectively . that indicates",
    "the optical spectra of 3c 454.3 is likely dominated by the synchrotron component .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the facts that 3c 454.3 strong variability in our observations and was in very high state ( gaur et al .",

    "we have 11 isp sources , and the average of their spectral indices is 1.19 .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that synchrotron emission dominates the optical band of these sources too .",
    "the spectral slopes of the hsps scatters in the range between 0.5 and 1.8 , while the predicted spectral slope under simple pure synchrotron emission models should be less than or equal to 0.75 or 0.80 , corresponding to the spectral index of optically thin synchrotron emitting plasma , @xmath78 ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "this indicates that the optical emission of hsps is contaminated by other components , such as a thermal contribution from the accretion disc or host galaxy , or else includes significant amounts of non - thermal emission originating from different regions of the relativistic jets .",
    "also , hsps are more generally stable in the optical bands , while great flares and sed changes are frequently seen to be confined to the x- and @xmath2-rays .",
    "this is consistent with the optical emission coming from a different region of the jet or with it being strongly diluted by thermal emission from the galaxy .",
    "for the nearby blazars , the host galaxy contribution is probably important ( pian et al .",
    "1994 ) . for mrk 421 ,",
    "tosti et al .  ( 1998a ) determined the spectral slope to be @xmath35=0.85 after the subtraction of an estimated host galaxy contribution .",
    "we determined the spectral indices of 6 hsps and for 3 of them @xmath35 could be found with the host galaxy contribution included as well as after the host galaxy subtraction ( table 7 ) . for mrk 421 , @xmath35 is found to be 1.08 and 0.619 before and after the host galaxy contribution , respectively and for 1es 1959 + 650 , @xmath35 is found to be 1.03 and 0.67 before and after the host galaxy contribution is removed , respectively . here",
    "we can say that there certainly is large deformation of the optical spectra of these hsps due to the thermal contribution from the host galaxies . however , for 1es 2344 + 514 , @xmath35 is nt affected much , with high values of 1.77 and 1.61 before and after the galaxy subtraction .",
    "so for this source , the optical emission may only be contaminated by non - thermal emission originating from elsewhere in the relativistic jet .",
    "we have investigated the possible correlations between the source intensity and the slope of the optical spectral energy distribution .",
    "7 shows the variability relations between the spectral slopes and the r band fluxes ( in mjy ) for 12 blazars .",

    ". however , the fsrq 3c 454.3 has a tendency to show a spectrum that becomes steeper when the object becomes brighter , which has also been seen by previous authors ( miller 1981 ; ramirez et al .  2004 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the fsrq 3c 279 has shown the opposite tendency but it is quite weak , having @xmath82 .",
    "for the other 3 lsps ( 3c 66a , s5 0716@xmath40714 and oj 287 ) , we found no significant correlation between flux and spectral slope . for j 0211@xmath401051 , on 231 , and bl lac",

    "we have carried out multi - band optical photometry of a sample of 11 blazars including 4 hsps , 4 lsps and 3 isps during 2009 to 2011 on short - term timescales .",
    "we found significant flux variations in all the sources except for 1es 1218@xmath40304 and 1es 1553@xmath40113 on short - term time scales .",
    "also , we searched for colour variations in the sources ; only three sources ( ao 0235@xmath40164 , s5 0716@xmath40714 and 1es 1426@xmath40428 ) showed significant colour variations on short - term timescales .",
    "we have studied idv for 4 sources ( s5 0716@xmath40714 , oj 287 , 1es 1426@xmath40428 and 1es 1553@xmath40113 ) during 18 nights and found genuine idv in 6 nights .",
    "we examined blazar colours for idv and found significant ( b@xmath33r ) colour variations on only 2 nights .",
    "we seached for possible correlations between colour and magnitude and found that 6 out of 10 bl lacs followed the bluer - when - brighter trend ; however , 5 sources ( 4 bl lacs and 1 fsrq ) lacked any such correlations .",
    "we studied the optical spectra of a total of 15 sources ( including 6 hsps , 6 lsps and 3 isps ) and compared these subclasses of blazars to provide some useful information on the emission components and emission mechanisms .",
    "lsp objects are extremely variable in optical bands and the average of the spectral slope of lsps @xmath35 @xmath391.5 , is in agreement with the synchrotron self - compton model .",
    "however , the sed of fsrqs probably have a contribution from a thermal bump that can noticeably contaminate the synchrotron component .",
    "the hsp spectral index varied from 0.5 to 1.8 , which indicate that in addition to the synchrotron emission they have contributions by components such as quasi - thermal emission from the accretion disc or non - thermal emission originating from different regions in the jet .",
    "for some hsps , the thermal contribution of the host - galaxy plays an important role .",
    "this is clearly seen in table 7 where we have been able to correct the spectral index for the host galaxy contribution for some nearby hsps for which the galaxy could be resolved .",
    "the optical spectra of some of the sources become flatter when they brighten ; however , for some sources we found no correlations or very weak opposite correlations .",
    "the relation between spectral slope and r magnitude of fsrqs suggests that the emission of fsrqs probably contains a thermal bump contribution and that this thermal component must be incorporated in detailed studies of individual sources .",
