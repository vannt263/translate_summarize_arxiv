    "in the past decade , the spin hall effect of electron , a phenomenon that is usually described as a transverse spin current @xcite generated by an electric current , drew much attention of the spintronics community .",
    "but there is still a controversy @xcite over the definition of spin current .",
    "since the spin hall effect is closely related to the spin polarization , we are concerned with the description the spin polarization of electron in continuous states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to advance a representation formalism for the spin polarization of free electron .    to this end",
    ", we will first isolate the spin from other degrees of freedom and identify a unit vector to characterize the spin polarization . as we know , when only the spin is considered , its polarization is totally determined by a normalized spinor .",
    "the spin polarization vector ( spv ) @xmath1 that corresponds to an arbitrary normalized spinor @xmath2 is defined as @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pauli vector .",
    "in fact , the spv and its corresponding spinor satisfy the following eigen equation , @xmath5 in addition , the non - commutativity of the cartesian components of the pauli vector requires a direction to determine the spatial quantization of the spin .",
    "this direction is known as the quantization axis ; and any state spinor @xmath2 can be expressed as a linear superposition of the two mutually orthogonal eigen spinors with respect to this axis .",
    "apart from the quantization axis , we identify a second direction to characterize the spv .",
    "this direction is denoted by unit vector @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown that upon changing @xmath0 by a so(3 ) rotation through an angle about the quantization axis , one realizes a su(2 ) rotation of the state spinor through twice the angle about the same axis . as a result , the corresponding spv is changed by a so(3 ) rotation also through twice the angle about the same axis . when applying this approach to a free electron by means of the plane - wave expansion and assuming the quantization axis for each plane wave to be the wave vector @xcite , we get a representation in which the unit vector @xmath0 plays its unique role in characterizing the spin polarization . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time to report on such a representation .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "an algebraic approach is advanced in section [ description of eigen spinors ] to find the two mutually orthogonal eigen spinors of spin operator @xmath6 , where unit vector @xmath7 denotes the quantization axis . from this approach we find in both the two eigen spinors the same degree of freedom that takes on the form of a unit vector @xmath0 .",
    "it describes the eigen spinors in such a way that a rotation of @xmath8 about the @xmath7 axis results in opposite changes in their phases . as a result , any spinor that is expressed as a superposition of the two eigen spinors is characterized by such a degree of freedom .",
    "it is shown in section [ description of spv ] that rotating unit vector @xmath8 through an angle will lead to a rotation of the spv through _ twice _ the angle .",
    "the same result is obtained in heisenberg picture as well .",
    "the previous approach is applied in section [ application ] to obtain a representation of free electron s spin polarization with the help of plane - wave expansion . upon assuming the quantization axis for each plane wave to be the wave vector , we arrive at a representation , the two polarization bases of which are characterized by the same unit vector as well as the same weighting function .",
    "the unit vector in this case is shown to play an independent role in describing the spin polarization .",
    "section [ conclusions ] concludes the paper with remarks .",
    "in this section , we will find a unit vector @xmath0 to determine the phases @xcite of both the eigen spinors @xmath9 that satisfy the following equation , @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the quantization axis . in order to do so ,",
    "let us first introduce this vector to express @xmath9",
    ".      given a quantization axis @xmath11 , we are free to introduce a unit vector @xmath8 that together with @xmath7 axis defines two unit vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the following way ,    [ u and v ] @xmath14    they form a cartesian system with @xmath7 .",
    "the pauli vector can be decomposed in this system as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath6 anti - commute with one another and satisfy the following relations ,    [ commutations ] @xmath18    in addition , orthogonal unit vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 form a basis to span the two - dimensional vector space that is perpendicular to unit vector @xmath7 . from this basis",
    "we construct a pair of mutually orthogonal complex unit vectors @xmath19 as follows ,    [ complex basis ] @xmath20    and define a pair of ladder operators , @xmath21 where the dependence of each quantity on unit vector @xmath8 is explicitly indicated . from eqs .",
    "( [ commutations ] ) and ( [ complex basis ] ) , one readily write down the following relations ,    [ property 1 ] @xmath22    they show that if a spinor @xmath2 is an eigen function of @xmath23 with eigen value @xmath24 , one has @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath2 is an eigen function of @xmath6 with eigen value @xmath26 , one has @xmath27 .",

    "and the second equation indicates that for any spinor @xmath2 that satisfies @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the eigen function of @xmath6 with eigen value @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the two normalized solutions to equation ( [ basic spinors ] ) have the form of    [ eigen spinors ] @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are any two fixed spinors satisfying @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , and @xmath38^{1/2 } } , \\nonumber \\\\ n_{- } & = & \\frac{1}{[\\chi^{\\dag}_2 ( 1 + \\mathbf{w } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma } )              \\chi_2]^{1/2 } }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the normalization coefficients which are independent of @xmath0 .       about @xmath7 axis through an angle @xmath39 . ]",
    "spinors in eqs .",
    "( [ eigen spinors ] ) are always eigen functions no matter how one chooses the unit vector @xmath8 .",
    "that is to say , they have degrees of freedom represented by the unit vector @xmath8 . in the following",
    "we will show that this unit vector plays the role of determining the phases of the eigen spinors . according to eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) , only the azimuthal angle of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath7 has effect on vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "so the unit - vector degree of freedom in this case reduces to this azimuthal angle which varies with the rotation of @xmath8 about @xmath7 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ azimuthal angle ] . for the sake of convenience , we write out the matrices of two different rotations .",
    "the matrix of a so(3 ) rotation @xmath40 through an angle @xmath41 about the @xmath7 axis can be written as @xcite @xmath42 where the superscript @xmath43 means transpose , and the components of matrix vector @xmath44 are given by @xmath45 and the matrix of a su(2 ) rotation @xmath46 through an angle @xmath41 about the @xmath7 axis can be written as @xcite @xmath47 they are related to each other via @xcite @xmath48 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma }      = u(\\phi\\mathbf{w } ) ( \\mathbf{a } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma } )       u^{\\dag}(\\phi\\mathbf{w}),\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is an arbitrary 3-component vector .",
    "we have the following theorem :    theorem 1 : when unit vector @xmath8 is transformed as @xmath50 by a so(3 ) rotation through an angle @xmath39 , eigen spinors @xmath51 and @xmath52 are transformed as    [ rotation of eigen spinors ] @xmath53    respectively , by a su(2 ) rotation through twice the angle , @xmath54 .",
    "let us prove transformation ( [ rotation of eigen spinor 1 ] ) .",

    "transformation ( [ rotation of eigen spinor 2 ] ) can be proven in the same way .",
    "we see from theorem 1 that the rotation of @xmath0 results in a change of @xmath64 and @xmath65 in their phases .",
    "this shows that the azimuthal angle of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath11 determines the phases of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the role of the fixed spinors @xmath34 and @xmath35 in eqs .",

    "since @xmath72 plays a similar role as the jones vector plays in optics , we will call @xmath72 the generalized jones vector . now",

    "it deserves reemphasizing that the polar angle of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath11 is a degenerate degree of freedom in this case . only the azimuthal angle plays the role .",
