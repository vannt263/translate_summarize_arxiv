    "+ in this paper , by using the approach of our previous papers @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , we are going to consider the information that can be extracted from pulled - back tensor fields when we consider states of composite systems acted upon by local unitary groups , the so called gauge groups which do not change the entanglement properties of the starting state . in some sense these submanifolds are made of quantum states with the `` same content of entanglement '' .",
    "clearly the procedure can handle bipartite systems and multipartite systems . in this paper",
    "however we shall limit ourselves to bipartite systems .",
    "how it will be clear from the text , the selected submanifold of quantum states need not be associated with unitary representations of lie groups , as a matter of fact within the stratified manifold of states , strata may be identified with orbits of the general linear group while states on the orbits of the unitary local group not only have the same rank of the initial quadratic form but also the same `` spectrum''@xcite@xcite .",
    "we are confident that methods from differential geometry will turn out to be useful whenever some spaces of interest ( like for instance spaces of entangled states ) do not carry a linear structure .",
    "+ we shall review very briefly how covariant tensor fields may be pulled - back from the complex projective space to the identified submanifold of states . then we consider the particular situation of composite systems and analyze the pulled - back tensor when the starting state is separable and when the starting state is entangled .",
