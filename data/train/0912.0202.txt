    "many thousands of x - ray sources are discovered using x - ray cameras with modest spectral resolution , such as the ccd detectors on the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3-@xmath4 space observatories . after detecting and locating the source",
    ", the observer often seeks to estimate intrinsic properties of the source , particularly its flux in a broad band of interest and spectral characteristics such as power law index , thermal plasma temperature , or column density of line - of - sight gas absorbing soft x - rays .",
    "low - resolution source and background spectra are extracted from the ccd data , and @xmath5 or maximum likelihood statistical nonlinear regression of these data with multi - parameter spectral models is performed with codes such as xspec , sherpa , or midas .",
    "we have been particularly concerned with the study of large populations of faint x - ray sources associated with pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars residing in or near molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these and other studies of x - ray - bright young stars use a spectral model family involving one- or two - temperature thermal plasmas with a particular pattern of non - solar elemental abundances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "each star is subject to a different absorption due to its chance location in the molecular cloud and , for the youngest systems , its local protostellar envelope .",
    "however , when faint sources are considered , there can be too few counts to obtain reliable spectral fits using regression methods ; a wide range of models can be fit to the same distribution of source photon energies .",
    "while apparent broad - band fluxes can still be estimated , the role of absorption , the intrinsic fluxes , and true plasma temperature(s ) are often poorly constrained from spectral modeling of faint sources . also",
    ", parametric regression analyses are often inhomogeneous in practice ; two - temperature plasma models may be fit to lightly - absorbed , bright ( say , @xmath6200 count ) sources while fainter and/or highly - absorbed sources may be fit with one - temperature plasma models . there is thus a motivation to consider nonparametric approaches to interpreting x - ray ccd energy distributions which can be applied in a uniform fashion to bright and faint sources .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the nonparametric inference of intrinsic x - ray luminosities and absorbing column densities which can be efficiently obtained for large populations of both bright and faint x - ray ccd sources .",
    "the concept of the method is similar to the long - standing use of color - magnitude diagrams in optical and infrared astronomy . for pms stars , a photometric magnitude and at least one suitable color index , such as the @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 color magnitude diagram ,",
    "are used in conjunction with distance , age estimates , and stellar interior evolutionary models to estimate stellar masses , bolometric luminosities , and line - of - sight absorption . in our proposed method ,",
    "photometric x - ray quantities such as apparent hard - band background - corrected flux ( analogous to the @xmath7 magnitude ) and background - corrected total - band median energy ( analogous to the @xmath9 color ) are used to estimate absorption - corrected x - ray fluxes , and line - of - sight absorbing column densities .",
    "we apply our nonparametric estimates to a large sample of faint x - ray sources in the m  17 star - forming region ( * ? ? ? * and townsley et al .",

    "intrinsic spectra for this class of stars are calibrated to the high signal - to - noise @xmath2 acis - i spectra from the sensitive @xmath2 orion ultradeep project ( coup ; * ? ? ?",
    "reliability of our nonparametric methods , including both systematic bias and statistical uncertainty , are evaluated using simulated x - ray sources with known properties .",
    "the technical concept of avoiding nonlinear parametric modeling , especially in cases of faint sources , is not new . in _",
    "acis studies , @xcite used the extracted x - ray mean energy and its comparison with the simulated spectra of one - temperature models to infer some stellar properties .",
    "our method differs in the use of more physically realistic spectral models and the use of the median instead of mean energy to be statistically robust against outliers . @xcite",
    "also comment that median energies can give effective spectral estimators in x - ray ccd spectroscopy , but they use the median in conjunction with quartiles which can be statistically less reliable for very faint sources . for example , the 25%-50%-75% energy quartiles are readily estimated for a source with 9 photons ( the energies of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 photons ) , but are not readily estimated if 8 or 10 photons are present .    this study is closely linked to the _ acis extract _ software package for _ chandra _ acis data analysis which is described by @xcite .",
    "we use _ acis extract _ version 2009 - 01 - 27 in the analysis here .",
    "an initial step requires the definition of the intrinsic spectral shape of the population of x - ray sources under study ; this may be flux - dependent .",
    "this shape may be obtained from previous spectral analysis of brighter sources of the same class , or from astrophysical models . in our application to young stars , we use flux - dependent thermal plasma models . in other applications , such as active galactic nuclei in extragalactic surveys or x - ray binaries in nearby galaxy studies ,",
    "different spectral shapes would be used (  [ other_classes_section ] ) .",
    "we use the coup spectral results as calibrators of acis observations of star populations in more distant star formation regions .",
    "spectral templates derived from bright coup sources will be used to translate apparent photometric properties of weak pms stars into their intrinsic properties . in  [ apparent_aefluxes_section ] and  [ mede_section ] , we will concentrate on two observable properties of each source : the apparent hard - band x - ray flux , @xmath13 , and the x - ray total - band median energy of background - corrected extracted counts , @xmath14 . here",

    "a few dozen coup super - hot stars with their @xmath20 above 5  kev are omitted @xcite .",
    "the square symbols in the figure and the parameters in table  [ tbl1 ] define a set of eleven model families we adopt for the class of pms stars .",

    "source photometry properties are obtained by running _",
    "acis extract_. here we provide details on steps 2 - 4 which estimate the source s absorption and intrinsic broad - band fluxes .    in step 2 , one of the 11 simulated pms spectral model families listed in table [ tbl1 ]",
    "is assigned to each individual source of interest based on that source s hard - band apparent luminosity and full - band median energy . for lightly obscured stars ( @xmath62  kev ) , the ratio of intrinsic to apparent flux in the hard - band is @xmath63  dex for all spectral models ( figure [ fig_redcorr_vs_mede_sim]b ) , so that apparent hard - band luminosity @xmath45 only slightly underestimates the intrinsic hard - band source luminosity @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath63  dex luminosity difference is much less than the quantization of 0.5  dex on @xmath22 used to create the coup template models ( figure [ fig_models ] and table [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "thus , for a lightly obscured pms star , the apparent luminosity @xmath45 can be used directly to assign a specific spectral model family ( `` best model family '' ) from those listed in table [ tbl1 ] .    for a heavily obscured pms star ( @xmath64  kev ) , the source s median energy @xmath14 is compared to the calibration of intrinsic to apparent flux ratios ( figure [ fig_redcorr_vs_mede_sim]b and table [ tbl_calibration3 ] ) to choose 11 candidate @xmath65 values corresponding to 11 template model families .",

    "photometric fluxes are de - biased using calibration curves ( figure [ fig_xspec_vs_phot_sim ] and table [ tbl_calibration1 ] ) for the source s spectral model .",
    "the absorbing column density is then estimated using the source s median energy ( figure [ fig_nh_vs_mede_sim ] and table [ tbl_calibration2 ] ) .",
    "step 4 uses the resulting @xmath48 estimate to obtain absorption - corrected fluxes ( figure [ fig_redcorr_vs_mede_sim ] and table [ tbl_calibration3 ] ) .    to visually represent the transformation of apparent to intrinsic stellar properties in our method , figure [ fig_xraycmd ] shows the x - ray `` color - magnitude diagram '' derived from the simulated pms star data . in this diagram , the apparent hard - band luminosity ( @xmath45 ) , apparent total - band median energy ( @xmath14 ) , absorbing column density ( @xmath48 ) , and intrinsic hard - band luminosity ( @xmath22 ) are analogues to oir magnitude , color , extinction , and bolometric luminosity , respectively .",
    "we note again the degeneracy in low values of absorbing column density at @xmath67  kev due to the 0.5  kev limit of the _ chandra_-acis instrument .",
    "we estimate uncertainties in source properties derived using our photometric procedures including both small-@xmath68 statistical errors and systematic uncertainties in our knowledge of the x - ray spectral model .",
    "systematic errors associated with the astronomical source properties , such as distance or x - ray variability , are not considered here .",
    "we also omit systematic errors of instrumental origin .",
    "errors in the arf , which is based on calibration of the _ chandra _ mirrors and acis detector , are anticipated to be small and become comparable to statistical uncertainties only for sources with @xmath69 counts @xcite .",
    "the procedures for the error analysis of photometric quantities described here are outlined in figure [ fig_flow_chart_part2 ] .",
    "first , we estimate statistical errors on the x - ray median energy statistic using simulated data . passing simulated model spectra (  [ model_section ] ) through the marx mirror - detector simulator , we slice the resulting x - ray event lists into thousands of subsamples of different sizes .",
    "distributions of the median energy statistic are then obtained and corresponding standard errors , @xmath70 , encompassing 68% of the values are recorded .",
    "the resulting standard errors for the total - band and hard - band median energies for the 11 pms spectral model families are shown in figure  [ fig_mede_errors ] and tabulated in table [ tbl_calibration4 ] .",
    "figure [ fig_mede_errors ] shows that median energy errors range from @xmath71% for sources with 100 counts to @xmath72% for sources with 10 counts .",
    "these values are larger than expected from a standard gaussian distribution , although the errors do scale roughly with @xmath73 . at very low ( @xmath62  kev ) and very high ( @xmath74  kev ) median energy values ,",
    "errors are reduced due to the energy limits of the @xmath2 instrumental response .",

    "again we recall that the results here are specific to the _ chandra _ acis mirror - detector combination and pms stellar spectral models .",
    "researchers working with data from other x - ray telescopes or source classes are advised to produce new error estimates for the median energy statistic .",
    "however , we expect that the qualitative findings will be similar for other systems .    to estimate the effects of these median energy uncertainties ( figure [ fig_mede_errors ] or table [ tbl_calibration4 ] ) , we propagate them along with uncertainty on source net counts to errors on apparent fluxes ( equations 1 - 4 ) using standard methods ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . this is step 5 of the procedure shown in figure [ fig_flow_chart_part2 ] .",
    "step 6 of the procedure propagates the median energy errors through the relations between median energy and absorbing column density ( figure [ fig_nh_vs_mede_sim ] and table [ tbl_calibration2 ] ) to estimate both statistical and systematic errors in @xmath76 .",
    "this is illustrated in the insert diagram of figure [ fig_nh_vs_mede_sim ] .",
    "statistical errors on @xmath76 are derived by propagating errors on @xmath14 using the curve for the `` best model family '' (  [ translate_section ] ) .",
    "systematic errors on @xmath76 are estimated by propagating the value of the @xmath14 itself to other possible spectral models ; we use the `` second nearest neighbor '' as a plausible range for model uncertainty ( see the dashed lines in figure [ fig_models ] which are discussed in  [ model_section ] ) .    finally , we estimate statistical and systematic errors on the absorption - corrected hard - band ( @xmath50 ) and full - band ( @xmath49 ) fluxes by propagating errors already obtained for @xmath14 , @xmath13 , and @xmath41 .",
    "this propagation uses the absorption correction calibrations in figure [ fig_redcorr_vs_mede_sim ] and table [ tbl_calibration3 ] . as with @xmath76 , statistical errors on intrinsic source fluxes are estimated using the best spectral model , while systematic errors are estimated using the `` second nearest neighbor '' models .",

    "recall from  [ model_section ] that a bright calibration sample of young stars in the orion nebula indicated a generic spectral model for this class of x - ray sources : a two - temperature thermal plasma with the cooler temperature fixed and the hotter temperature scaled to x - ray luminosity ( figures [ fig_models ] and [ fig_models_acc_strata ] ) .",
    "this property of pms stars allowed us to simulate x - ray models , and calibrate the derivation of astrophysical absorption and fluxes from the observed counts .",

    "but at higher redshifts , quasar spectra appear to soften as luminosity increases @xcite .",
    "as there is substantial scatter in @xmath117 at both low and high redshifts , care must be taken to propagate uncertainties in spectral index through our procedures for estimating errors in the inferred broad - band fluxes and absorption .",
