    "monte carlo simulations of qcd with dynamical quarks are done in most cases at relatively large quark masses ( typically two quark flavours with @xmath9 ) .",
    "this makes the extrapolation to the physical point @xmath10 rather uncertain .",
    "the extrapolation is done by using ( pq)chpt  typically to nlo ( 1-loop ) order .",
    "estimates @xcite show that one should perform simulations in the range @xmath11 in order to see the expected logarithmic dependence . matching",
    "the predicted functional dependence is a crucial test for lattice qcd .    until recently the comparison between lattice data and chpt was not satisfactory . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we suggested that the agreement can be found when going to light enough dynamical quarks .",
    "here we supplement some integration of the analysis of @xcite and provide some further comments .",
    "for our simulation we used the algorithm described in @xcite and further improved as in @xcite and references therein . in our range of parameters we found that the cost for producing one independent gauge field configuration roughly goes as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the quark mass in lattice unit , @xmath14 is the number of lattice points and the factor @xmath15flop for the plaquette , but one order of magnitude smaller for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we produced three sets of @xmath18 thermalized configurations for @xmath19 unimproved wilson fermions at vol@xmath20 , @xmath6 and @xmath21 . from these points we extrapolated a value of @xmath22 at @xmath23 which is @xmath24 .",
    "this corresponds to an uv cutoff @xmath25fm @xmath26 , and to a physical volume @xmath27fm . in those three points we found a ratio @xmath28 equal to @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . here",
    "@xmath32 represents the sea quark mass defined as @xmath33 , when the strange quark mass corresponds to @xmath34 @xcite . for the lightest valence quarks the ratios @xmath35 become respectively @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "even with these small quark masses finite volume effects are expected to be under control since we have always @xmath39 . of course",
    "this is payed with a very low uv cutoff , and one expects large lattice artifacts .",
    "these are taken into account in the analysis .",
    "our first goal is to confront the results of numerical simulations with the ( pq)chpt formulas @xcite . in order to cancel the @xmath40-factors of multiplicative renormalization , which in the case of a mass - independent renormalization scheme only depend on the gauge coupling and not on the quark mass , we considered ratios of quark masses ( @xmath41 ) , pion masses ( @xmath42 ) and pion decay constants ( @xmath43 ) . here",
    "@xmath44 stand for the flavor indices of valence ( @xmath45 ) or sea ( @xmath46 ) quarks .",
    "if we assume that there are no lattice artifacts , no nnlo corrections and we take for @xmath47 its tree level estimate , @xmath48 , then the ratios ( here @xmath49 ) @xmath50 ,   \\\\",
    "rrn \\hspace{-7pt } & \\equiv & \\hspace{-7pt } \\frac{4\\xi m_{vs}^4}{(\\xi\\hspace{-3pt}+\\hspace{-3pt}1)^2m_{vv}^2 m_{ss}^2 } \\hspace{-3pt}= \\hspace{-3pt}1 + \\hspace{-3pt}\\frac{\\chi_s^{est } [ \\log(\\xi)\\hspace{-3pt}-\\hspace{-3pt}\\xi \\hspace{-3pt}+\\hspace{-3pt}1]}{16n_s\\pi^2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are non trivial and parameterless predictions of chpt .",
    "this provides a strong check of how far we are from the nlo chpt regime . in figure",
    "[ fig : rrf ] and [ fig : rrn ] we superimpose the predicted functions to the data .",
    "the agreement is of course not complete ( there are indeed @xmath51 and nnlo effects ) , but the corrections are sub - dominant contributions .",
    "moreover the agreement improves when the sea quark masses decrease .    encouraged by this results",
    ", we systematically compared our data with those ratios of pion masses and coupling constants which determine the gasser - leutwyler @xcite coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "since we expected large lattice artifacts in the data , the comparison was done with w(pq)chpt @xcite , including @xmath51 lattice artifacts in the effective continuum theory .",
    "besides that , we also included the relevant contributions from nnlo chpt @xcite .",
    "although this involve many parameters , one can obtain enough constraints from partially quenched simulations .",
    "the details of the fitting procedure and the results are described in @xcite .",
    "here we simply add that , following the analysis of @xcite , we can now include also @xmath52 lattice artifacts in our fit of the pion mass ratios .",
    "it turns out that this does not add new parameters to the fit , but it amounts to a redefinition of the wilson - chpt coefficients @xmath53 .    in order to have a consistency check of the surprisingly small lattice artifacts that we found , we compared the results of @xcite with those obtained in an older simulation with larger lattice spacing ( @xmath54 , @xmath55fm ) @xcite . the comparison ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scarr ] and [ fig : scafvv ] ) shows quite small scale breaking .",
    "larger scale breaking ( @xmath56 ) are observed for the ratio @xmath57 , which at fixed @xmath58 goes from @xmath59 ( at @xmath6 ) to @xmath60 ( at @xmath61 ) .",
    "to summarize : we showed that it is possible to simulate , with reasonable costs , very light dynamical quarks .",
    "compensating @xmath51 effects by introducing @xmath51 terms in the pqch - lagrangian is , in this case , a viable alternative to @xmath51 improvement of the action .",
    "the observed @xmath51 contributions in the light goldstone boson sector are surprisingly small , while nnlo are still important .",
    "the expected behavior predicted by pqchpt is already visible , although a quantitative determination of the lec s still needs further simulations at smaller masses and lattice spacing .",
    "most of the numerical calculations presented here have been done at the computers of nic - juelich and zeuthen",
