    "the random walk is a paradigmatic model of statistical physics , which combines utmost conceptual simplicity with a surprising richness of emergent behaviors @xcite . among the many interesting features of random walks",
    ", recent research has focused in particular on its extremal properties , exploring quantities such as the height and position of the globally maximal excursion of a one - dimensional walk of a given number of steps , and the statistics of _ records _ of this process @xcite . here",
    "a record is defined as an entry in a discrete , real valued time series that is larger ( upper record ) or smaller ( lower record ) than all previous entries .",
    "while the mathematical theory of records is well developed for time series of independent , identically distributed random variables @xcite , little has been known about the record statistics of correlated processes .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that records of a large class of one - dimensional random walks can be characterized in considerable detail , as was shown in recent work by majumdar and ziff ( mz ) @xcite . specifically , they considered the random process defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( say ) and the step sizes @xmath11 are independent , identically distributed random variables drawn from a probability density @xmath12 that is required to be continuous and symmetric , but is otherwise arbitrary .",
    "we say that an upper record occurs at time @xmath1 if @xmath13 .",
    "based on the sparre andersen theorem for the survival probability of the random walk @xcite , mz show that the probability @xmath14 for the @xmath1th event to be the @xmath15th record is given by @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the first moment of this distribution with respect to @xmath15 yields the mean number of records after @xmath1 steps , which equals @xmath18 for large @xmath1 , and the probability @xmath19 for the @xmath1th event to be a record ( henceforth referred to as the _ record rate _ )",
    "decays like @xmath20 . in the present paper",
    "we aim to generalize these results to random walks with asymmetric jump distributions . in the first part of the paper ( sections [ section_survival ] and [ section_drift ] ) we study records generated by random walks with a symmetric jump distribution that have an additional constant _ drift _ @xmath3 , such that ( [ rw ] ) generalizes to @xmath21 with a symmetric jump distribution @xmath12 .",
    "for the special case of a cauchy distribution this problem was considered previously in @xcite . here",
    ", we derive approximate results for the case of a gaussian jump distribution that apply also more generally to distributions with a finite variance .",
    "similar to our earlier work @xcite on the related problem of records from independent random variables with drift @xcite , our strategy will be to analyze the limiting cases of small and large drift , respectively , as quantified by the ratio @xmath22 of the drift speed to the standard deviation @xmath2 of the jump distribution @xmath12 .",
    "for the gaussian random walk we find that in the limit of @xmath23 the mean number of records and the record rate are given by @xmath24 in the limit of @xmath25 the record rate @xmath0 approaches a constant value .",
    "if in addition @xmath26 , this constant is given approximately by @xmath27    in section [ section_sp500 ] we apply our results to fluctuations in stock prices , arguably one of the most important ( and ancient ) applications of random walk theory @xcite .",
    "the basic model of a stock price is the geometric random walk @xmath28 with an upward bias reflecting long - term economic growth .",
    "our analysis of record events in the standard & poors 500 index shows a corresponding surplus of upper record events , which is consistent with the theoretical expectation .",
    "however , an asymmetry between upper and lower records remains even when the bias has been ( approximately ) removed @xcite , a feature that may be related to the gain - loss asymmetry reported in previous analyses of stock market fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a summary and a discussion of some open problems .",
    "the record statistics of a random walk can be analyzed by considering the generating functions of the survival and first passage probabilities of the process @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the generating function of @xmath14 is of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the generating function of the positive ( negative ) survival probability @xmath31 of the random walk .",
    "the latter is defined as the probability that the process stays above ( below ) the origin up to the @xmath1th step .",
    "similarly @xmath32 is the generating function of the positive ( negative ) first - passage probability @xmath33 of the random walk , with @xmath34 . in the case of the symmetric random walk considered in @xcite",
    "we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 and both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are completely universal for all continuous jump distributions .",
    "since we want to study asymmetric random walks , we need distinguish between positive and negative survival probabilities and first passage times , and consider the functions @xmath31 and @xmath33 . as in @xcite",
    "a theorem by sparre andersen will play a key role in our considerations . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the probability for the walker to be above or below the origin at the @xmath1th step .",
    "this quantity can be easily computed from @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the positional probability density of a random walk of @xmath1 steps that started at the origin .",
    "details on the computation of @xmath43 and @xmath40 can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in the case of",
    "a symmetric random walk we simply have @xmath44 independent of @xmath1 and we find that in this case @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "these results eventually lead to eq .",

    "the dotted line represents the analytical results obtained in eq .",
    "( [ qn ] ) . for small drift @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "we find good agreement with this approximation . ]    in the case of an asymmetric random walk the situation gets a bit more complicated .",
    "we compute @xmath31 and its generating function for a gaussian random walk with drift @xmath3 . here , the jump distribution of the symmetric random variable @xmath53 in ( [ drift ] ) is of the form @xmath54 with standard deviation @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to show that the probability density @xmath42 of the random walk after @xmath1 steps is given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we start with the case of a small linear drift with @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "now we can employ eq .",
    "( [ sparreandersen ] ) . expanding up to first order in @xmath3",
    "we find @xmath59 with @xmath60 and making use of the cauchy formula for products of infinite sums we obtain the following expression for @xmath30 : @xmath61 the binomial coefficient can be approximated by @xmath62 and with this we can approximate the sum over @xmath63 by an integral , @xmath64 we thus obtain a simple result for the generating function of the survival probability , @xmath65 and finally the following expression for the survival probability @xmath66 under a small linear drift : @xmath67 the first term on the right hand side is the result for the symmetric random walk discussed in @xcite , which is now supplemented by a correction linear in @xmath68 .",
    "although this particular result for @xmath31 will not be needed in our derivation of the record statistics , we found it useful to test it against numerical simulations .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qnc ] . for small @xmath3 , eq.([qn ] ) is in good agreement with the simulations .    for the sake of completeness we also provide the small @xmath3 expansion of @xmath32 that will become important later . with @xmath69",
    "we find @xmath70 from this we obtain , by methods very similar to those used above to derive @xmath31 , the result @xmath71    next we consider the case of large drift , @xmath72 . here",
    "we will only discuss @xmath73 , as this is the quantity needed for the computation of the record rate ; @xmath74 has a different behavior in this regime . in the limit of @xmath72",
    "we find that @xmath75 .",
    "using this we find that for large @xmath1 , @xmath76 and @xmath73 are of the form @xmath77 these particular results were already reported in @xcite . at this point",
    "it is important to notice that all results concerning the first - passage and survival probabilities in the large @xmath1 limit are easily transferable to other jump distributions as long as these have a finite variance . because of the central limit theorem , @xmath43 and therefore @xmath40 will approach the same expressions for large @xmath1 as were derived here for the gaussian jump distribution",
    "with the small @xmath3 expansions in eqs .",
    "( [ qz ] ) and ( [ fz ] ) we have all ingredients needed to derive the record statistics for a gaussian random walk with a small linear drift .",
    "we start by computing the mean number of records @xmath79 expected up to the @xmath1th step . for the generating function @xmath80 of this quantity",
    "it was found in @xcite that @xmath81 , a result that can be obtained by computing the first moment of eq .",
    "( [ pmz ] ) . we can now evaluate this expression making use of the generating function for @xmath73 given in eq.([qz ] ) . in the limit of small",
    "@xmath68 this yields @xmath82 using the series expansion of @xmath83 and employing once again the cauchy formula for infinite sums and the stirling approximation , we find @xmath84 if @xmath1 is not too small , the sum over @xmath63 can be replaced by an integral and we finally obtain an approximate expression for the generating function of @xmath79 , @xmath85     of a random walk with a gaussian jump distribution ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the effect is represented by @xmath86 for different drift speeds @xmath3 .",
    "again , we simulated @xmath49 realizations of a random walk with @xmath50 steps for each drift speed .",
    "the line represents the analytical results obtained in eq .",
    "( [ pnc ] ) . for small",
    "drift speeds @xmath51 and @xmath52 we find good agreement with the approximation , but for @xmath87 the approximation is no longer accurate . ]     for a random walk with a uniform jump distribution with standard deviation @xmath47 .",
    "the parameters of the simulation are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pnc ] . even though the expression ( [ pnc ] ) was derived for a gaussian jump distribution , it is in a good agreement with the numerical results for small @xmath3 . ]",
    "the mean number of records of the random walk with a small linear drift @xmath3 is therefore approximately given by @xmath88 making use of the stirling approximation this yields the previously announced expression ( [ mnc ] ) for @xmath89 and , by taking a derivative with respect to @xmath1 , the record rate @xmath0 in the large @xmath1 limit as given in eq.([pnc ] ) .",
    "the leading order correction of the record rate due to the drift is seen to increase with @xmath90 and for larger @xmath1 it approaches a constant value . for large @xmath1",
    "( but still in the regime @xmath91 ) we find the simple result @xmath92 we compared eq.([pnc ] ) to simulations and found good agreement in the regime @xmath91 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pnc ] ) .",
    "we also compared this result with numerical simulations of the record rate for random walks with step sizes drawn from a uniform distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pncu ] ) .",
    "the results for the gaussian and the uniform distribution are very similar to each other already for small @xmath1 , reflecting the convergence expected from the central limit theorem .    .",
    "the figure illustrates the convergence of @xmath93 to the asymptotically constant record rate @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "the inset shows that the large drift result ( [ pnlargec ] ) becomes accurate for @xmath96 , and the bold dotted line shows that @xmath97 for @xmath98 . ]    ) of the record rate @xmath93 for gaussian random walks with @xmath99 and various drift speeds @xmath100 . ]",
    "next we consider the limit of strong drift , @xmath72 . applying the same method as above and making use of our result ( [ qzlargec ] ) for @xmath76 in the regime of large @xmath22",
    ", we find that the number of records increases linearly with time according to @xmath101 correspondingly the record rate @xmath19 is independent of @xmath1 in this case .",
    "in fact , simulations show that the record rate approaches a finite , nonzero limit @xmath102 for @xmath95 for any positive value of the drift ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pnclargen ] ) .",
    "this can be understood , on the basis of the general relation ( [ pmz ] ) between the distribution of record events and the negative first passage probability , to be a consequence of the fact that the negative mean first passage time of a random walk with positive drift is finite @xcite ; roughly speaking , one expects that the asymptotic record rate @xmath94 is proportional to the inverse of the negative mean first passage time .",
    "the result ( [ mnclarge ] ) implies that the asymptotic record rate behaves as @xmath103 for large @xmath22 ( see inset of fig.[fig : pnclargen ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since the negative mean first passage time diverges as @xmath104 for @xmath98 @xcite , the asymptotic record rate should behave as @xmath105 for small @xmath3 .",
    "this is confirmed by the simulations , which indicate that @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "the time scale @xmath108 at which the saturation of the record rate occurs can be estimated by comparing the two terms in eq.([pnsimple ] ) , which shows that @xmath109 for small @xmath3 .",
    "not surprisingly , this is also the time scale at which the drift begins to dominate the mean square displacement of the random walk .",
    "together with the linear behavior of the asymptotic record rate , this suggests the scaling form @xmath110 for small @xmath22 and arbitrary @xmath1 , where the limiting behaviors of the scaling function are @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "this relation is well fulfilled by the numerical data shown in fig.[fig : pncscal ] .",
    "a prominent application of the random walk process can be found in the financial sciences . originally introduced by bachelier in 1900 @xcite , the geometric random walk is the standard model used to describe the evolution of stock prices . in the application of this model to actual data , trends are always an issue , which in the simplest case are described by a linear drift in the logarithm of the stock price . in this section",
    "we present an empirical analysis of record events in historical stock prices taken from the standard & poors 500 index , and compare the results to the theoretical predictions derived above .",
    "the observational data we used consist of daily recordings of 366 stocks that were contained in the index from january 1990 to march 2009 , resulting in 366 time series of length @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "we first analyzed the recordings without any detrending and then considered detrended data in which a fitted linear trend was subtracted from the logarithms of the stock prices .    in the raw stock data",
    "the number of upper records after @xmath113 trading days is considerably larger than the expected number of @xmath114 for a symmetric random walk . at the end of the observation period",
    ", we found an average number of @xmath115 upper records in the stocks , but only @xmath116 lower records .",
    "the rate of upper records was roughly constant over the entire period , whereas the rate of lower records was almost zero already after 300 days .",
    "apparently a positive trend had a very strong effect on the record statistics of the analyzed stocks . to quantify the trend , we performed a linear regression analysis on the logarithms of the individual stock prices , determining the drift @xmath117 and the standard deviation of increments @xmath118 for each stock @xmath119 .",
    "the normalized drift @xmath120 was then averaged over all stocks , yielding the estimate @xmath121 . at @xmath113",
    "we are thus well outside the regime in which the pertubative result ( [ mnc ] ) should be valid .",
    "still , inserting the estimated normalized drift @xmath122 into ( [ mnc ] ) we obtain a record number of 166.59 , in very close agreement with the observed value .",
    "the comparison with monte carlo simulations of biased random walks with the same drift shows that this accuracy is actually fortuitous , but the description of the stock market data by the biased random walk model is nevertheless quite reasonable ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sp1 ] ) .",
    "stocks from the s&p 500 index , computed from daily va1ues for the time period 1.1.1990 - 31.3.2009 .",
    "full thick line shows the number of upper records , dotted thick line shows the number of lower records in the data set .",
    "the expected number of records @xmath123 for a symmetric random walk is shown by the thin dotted line .",
    "also shown are the predictions of the biased random walk model with effective normalized drift @xmath122 obtained from monte carlo simulations as well as from the approximate expression @xmath124 ( thin full line ) . ]    .",
    "the number of upper records is in good agreement with @xmath125 , but the number of lower records is significantly reduced . ]",
    "next we detrended the data by subtracting the fitted linear trend from the logarithmic stock prices , and counted the number of records in the detrended time series .",
    "we found an average number of @xmath126 upper records after @xmath127 steps , in close agreement with the result for a symmetric random walk .",
    "however , the number of lower records was only @xmath128 , which is significantly smaller than expected .",
    "this residual asymmetry between upper and lower records persists if , instead of subtracting an overall linear trend , the data are detrended by normalizing each stock by the index @xcite . to further explore this phenomenon",
    "we split the time series into @xmath129 shorter series each lasting @xmath130 trading days .",
    "we detrended each of the shorter time series individually by subtracting a linear trend , counted the number of upper and lower records , and then averaged the record numbers over the whole ensemble of @xmath131 series of length 100 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp2 ] .",
    "it appears that while the number of upper records is in a very good agreement with the symmetric random walk model , the number of lower records is still suppressed .",
    "this effect was found for different choices of the lengths of the time series and appears to be independent of this choice .",
    "qualitatively , a reduced number of lower records indicates that the positive first - passage times are increased compared to the corresponding negative first passage times .",
    "an asymmetry between first passage times to a prescribed ( positive or negative ) return level has in fact been observed in previous analyses of stock market data , and is known as the _ gain - loss asymmetry _ @xcite .",
    "however , this phenomenon differs in several important respects from the one reported here .",
    "first , in most ( though not all @xcite ) cases the sign of the asymmetry is opposite to that suggested by the asymmetry in the record statistics , in that first passage times for crossing a prescribed level from below are larger than for crossings from above @xcite .",
    "second , the asymmetry vanishes when the prescribed return level tends to zero , which is the relevant limit for the analysis of records . finally , in contrast to the asymmetry between upper and lower records reported here , the gain - loss asymmetry is a property of entire stock indices which does not occur in individual stocks @xcite .",
    "indeed , a preliminary analysis of first - passage times to the origin in the detrended s&p 500 data shows an asymmetry between positive and negative excursions only when the starting point of the excursion is conditioned to be a record event @xcite .",
    "an explanation of the observed residual asymmetry between upper and lower records must therefore be left to future work .",
    "in conclusion , using the methods introduced in @xcite and a more general form of the sparre andersen theorem @xcite , we were able to describe the effect of a linear drift on the record statistics of a gaussian random walk in two regimes .",
    "for short times @xmath132 we find that the correction to the record rate @xmath133 increases proportional @xmath134 and then saturates at a value of @xmath135 . on the other hand , for large @xmath1 the record rate saturates at a constant limiting value @xmath94 , which is linear in @xmath3 for @xmath107 and approaches unity for large @xmath22 according to eq.([pnlargec ] ) .",
    "the transition between the two regimes is described by the scaling form ( [ pnscal ] ) .",
    "we applied our results to the statistics of records in @xmath136 stocks contained in the s&p 500 index from 1990 to 2009 .",
    "we found that , after detrending , the number of upper records in the stocks is basically identical to that predicted for the symmetric random walk . the fact that the number of lower records appears to be systematically decreased is interesting and needs to be examined more thouroughly in the future . on the theoretical side ,",
    "a possible topic for future research is the record statistics of asymmetric random walks with a more complicated asymmetry than just a constant drift .",
    "the issue of asymmetric random walks with discrete jump distributions is also still open for further investigations .",
    "we thank i. szendro and j. franke for helpful discussions and support , and gratefully acknowledge the department of business administration and finance at the university of cologne for providing access to the stock data from the s&p 500 .",
    "financial support was provided by dfg within the bonn cologne graduate school of physics and astronomy ."
