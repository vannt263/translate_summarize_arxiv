    "strongly frustrated spin systems are in the focus of many recent works as the competition of exchange interactions leads to interesting ground states and a rich low energy excitation spectrum . of these systems , the @xmath3 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice has been of special interest , since it displays a unique quantum disordered and highly degenerate ground state , i.e. a spin liquid @xcite .",
    "a kagome lattice consists of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) arrangement of corner - sharing triangles . in systems with large spin",
    "so called weather - vane modes , low energy collective rotations of spins on a hexagon , destabilize any order . for @xmath3 a quantum superposition of an infinitely dense spectrum of low energy singlet and triplet excitations",
    "are supposed to exist .",
    "defects on the kagome lattice may lead to a gapless valence bond glass phase @xcite with enhanced singlet bonds opposite to the defects .",
    "together with antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions a quantum critical point is induced @xcite . despite these and other @xcite theoretical investigations ,",
    "the understanding of the ground state properties and the excitation spectrum of the quantum kagome system is not completely satisfactory .",
    "earlier experimental investigations of compounds that are close in realizing the kagome layer are hampered either by interlayer interactions , a non - uniform , more complex distribution of exchange coupling constants or spin anisotropies .",
    "the first reported material with 2d kagome layers was srcr@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite with @xmath7 .",
    "it * shows * a spin - glass transition for temperatures below @xmath8 k despite the much larger interaction strength . in the @xmath7 compound y@xmath9ca@xmath9baco@xmath5o@xmath10",
    "@xcite short ranged chiral spin correlations develop at low temperature , while the @xmath3 compound rbcu@xmath0snf@xmath11 @xcite experiences a spin gap that separates the singlet groundstate from low energy triplet excitations .",
    "presently the compound zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 is the only well characterized realization of the @xmath3 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a perfect kagome lattice @xcite .",
    "it exists in two structurally slightly different forms : a ) kapellasite @xcite and b ) herbertsmithite .",
    "small single crystals , however , are up to now only available as herbertsmithite . in this compound ,",
    "the cu@xmath12 ions form the triangular kagome lattice in the crystallographic ab - layer and are coupled by oxygen atoms via superexchange pathways , leading to strong antiferromagnetic correlations of about * @xmath13 k*. despite this strong coupling , susceptibility measurements reveal no magnetic ordering down to 50 mk @xcite .",
    "the planes of these kagome structures are separated by intermediate layers of zn and cl atoms and can therefore ideally be considered as 2 dimensional layers with negligible magnetic interactions along the third dimension .",
    "however , zn / cu antisite disorder of at about 6@xmath14 @xcite is believed to be present in previously studied herbertsmithite samples .",
    "hence , the presence of a small concentration of impurities may affect the spin correlations in the kagome plane .",
    "muon spin rotation ( @xmath15sr ) measurements on the paratacamite zn@xmath9cu@xmath16(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 showed a partly frozen ground state @xcite , which however disappears for higher zn / cu ratio .",
    "for the herbertsmithite , i.e. a zn to cu ratio of 1/3 , @xmath15sr did not reveal any ordering down to 50 mk .",
    "electron spin resonance measurements revealed dm interactions of about @xmath17 magnitude @xcite , which causes a ferromagnetic - like increase of susceptibility at low temperature .",
    "these and other experiments have been performed either on natural ( mineral ) crystals or powder samples @xcite . only recently , herbertsmithite single crystals were successfully grown via hydrothermal synthesis @xcite .",
    "our approach of investigating the excitations in the kagome lattice is using inelastic light scattering ( raman scattering ) .",
    "this is a unique method in the sense that it is sensitive to low energy topological , electronic , or magnetic excitations .",
    "singlet modes ( @xmath18 ) can be observed , which may otherwise only be probed in specific heat measurements .",
    "in particular , it has recently been suggested @xcite that studying the polarization dependence of the magnetic raman scattering contribution should allow to distinguish between different possible ground states such as a valence bond crystal or a spin liquid .",
    "of further interest is the spectral distribution of magnetic scattering as characteristic low energy slopes or sharp modes may be observed as signs of the topological character of the spin correlations @xcite .",
    "this study deals with two different types of samples : ( i ) natural crystallites from mineral sources , which show a dark green color and are slightly transparent .",
    "a selected crystallite from this source with the approximate volume of about 0.5 mm@xmath19 was studied via buerger precession method @xcite to confirm the sample s single domain structure and to uncover a natural surface that is parallel to the crystallographic ab - plane , in which the kagome lattice is realized .",
    "its stoichiometry , zn@xmath20cu@xmath21(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 , is slightly shifted from optimum .",
    "( ii ) a hydrothermally synthesized single crystal with a size of about 1 x 0.2 x 0.2 mm@xmath19 , which shows a very regular habitus , was studied in addition .",
    "it appears in light green color and high transparency and has a stoichiometry very close to the perfect kagome , i.e. zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 .    raman spectroscopic studies were performed in quasi - backscattering geometry with a solid state laser ( @xmath22 nm ) and 1 mw laser power .",
    "room temperature measurements were carried out under ambient conditions , while low - temperature measurements were done in an evacuated , closed - cycle cryostat .",
    "investigations of the polarization dependence were performed by rotating the sample within the ab plane . in the @xmath23 orientation ,",
    "the a axis was approximately perpendicular to both the polarization and the @xmath24 vector of the incident laser light .",
    "the spectra were collected via a triple spectrometer ( dilor - xy-500 ) by a liquid nitrogen cooled ccd ( horiba jobin yvon , spectrum one ccd-3000v ) . in a previous experiment powder samples of zn@xmath25cu@xmath26(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 ( with @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) were investigated to estimate the stoichiometry of the single crystals by comparing their phonon frequencies@xcite .",
    "these samples , however , do not allow to successfully study the weaker magnetic or topological raman scattering in the herbertsmithite .",

    "rotating the samples within the crystallographic ab plane ( with the axis of rotation along the @xmath24 vector of the incident light ) allows to distinguish between modes of a@xmath31 and e@xmath32 symmetry representation .",

    "we attribute these lorentzian lines to phonons .",
    "the factor group analysis yields 12 raman active phonon modes according to the @xmath35 space group : @xmath36 = 5 @xmath37 a@xmath31 + 7 @xmath37 e@xmath32 .",
    "in addition , we will later consider the a@xmath38 symmetry representations that can be induced by electronic resonances or dm interaction @xcite .",
    "the corresponding tensors are :    by rotating the samples within the ab plane ( @xmath39 plane ) the a@xmath31 modes are expected to give a rotation invariant contribution in parallel ( @xmath30 ) polarization and disappear in crossed ( @xmath40 ) polarization of incident and scattered light .",
    "the e@xmath32 modes should show a four - fold symmetry in both polarizations . due to the layered crystal structure and strongly anisotropic electronic polarizability perpendicular to the ab plane slight but inevitable misalignments of the crystals",
    "will show up as an additional two - fold modulation of the scattering intensity .",
    "the 5 high energies phonons at about 3500 @xmath33 ( 2 @xmath37 a@xmath31 + 3 @xmath37 e@xmath32 ) are due to vibrations of hydrogen atoms . in a deuterated powder sample they shift to lower energies with a renormalization factor of 0.74 , which is in good accordance to a simple estimate ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "we assign the modes at 365 , 402 and 501 @xmath33 to e@xmath32 symmetry , as their intensity clearly displays a four - fold rotational symmetry ( see fig .",
    "the phonon modes at 123 , 148 and 702 ( 697 ) @xmath33 are distinctly different as they show a two - fold rotational symmetry .",
    "we assign these modes to a@xmath31 symmetry and the two - fold modulation of intensity to a small deviation of the @xmath24 vector from the c axis , i.e. a slight canting of the sample surface .    in a previous investigation of a series of zn@xmath25cu@xmath26(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 powder samples we stated a linear dependence of the phonon mode at 702 ( 697 ) @xmath33 on composition .",
    "this allows us to estimate @xmath42 for the natural and @xmath43 for the synthesized single crystal , respectively .",
    "the synthesized single crystal is therefore in the regime of herbertsmithite stoichiometry .",
    "still , the natural single crystal is reasonably close to this state in the sense that thermodynamic and spectroscopic experiments did not observe evidence for long range ordering for @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "studying the two different samples should therefore allow determining the influence of spin defects and static doping on the spin dynamics .    a less intense , asymmetric mode with a fano lineshape",
    "is observed at 230 @xmath33 .",
    "this mode shows an even smaller intensity in the powder samples . its lineshape may originate from the coupling of the corresponding phonon to a continuum of states . as",
    "its energy range is within the energy range of spin - fluctuations @xcite and the compound is an insulator the corresponding continuum is attributed to magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the mode itself is probably induced by crystallographic disorder as the larger intensity modes already exhaust the total number of raman active modes .    at low frequency and for high temperatures",
    "there is a pronounced quasi elastic scattering contribution ( qes ) visible with a two - fold rotational anisotropy ( fig .",
    "1 b ) that is similar to the phonon modes at 123 , 148 and 702 ( 697 ) @xmath33 , identified as a@xmath31 phonons .",

    "such a scattering is frequently observed in compounds that realize low dimensional spin systems , as spin chains @xcite or frustrated dimer systems @xcite .",

    "again , the rotational invariance is distorted with two - fold symmetry but within experimental error identical to the one of the phonon modes identified as belonging to the a@xmath31 symmetry representation .    from the temperature dependence of the quasi elastic scattering intensity @xmath48 ) we can derive information on the evolution of low energy excitations . in , e.g. ,",

    "the power law - like temperature dependence in zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 differs clearly from that and implies a spin liquid with more gradually evolving correlations @xcite .",
    "we attribute the softer power law @xmath48 ) @xmath49 @xmath50 in the synthesized single crystal to the reduced number of defects leading to an even more gradual evolution of spin correlations .",
    "we will now discuss the three most recent theoretical investigations ( using different approaches and techniques ) of finite energy , magnetic raman scattering in a kagome system and their implications . as was suggested by cpas et al .",
    "@xcite , the formation of a valence bond crystal leads to a weakly broken translation symmetry of the spin system .",
    "thereby the magnetic raman response of the kagome plane should depend in a decisive way on the polarization of the incoming / scattered light , i.e. there should be characteristic oscillations of magnetic modes in the energy range of @xmath62 when the polarizations are rotated within the plane .",
    "in contrast , the `` true '' spin liquid exhibiting no broken symmetry should show a polarization independent magnetic raman response . since experimental investigations using different techniques have up to",
    "now not observed a spin gap , the raman experiment is highlighted to be potentially sensitive to even weakly broken symmetries in kagome plane .",
    "it should be noted that in the second order perturbational treatment used by cpas et al .",
    "magnetic scattering is only observed in e@xmath32 symmetry , as the a@xmath31 component commutes with the used exchange scattering hamiltonian .",
    "recently , calculations based on a modified shastry - shraiman model describing a @xmath63(1 ) dirac spin liquid have been performed by ko , et al .",
    "@xcite . in this approximation also",
    "higher order terms , induced e.g. by electronic resonances of the phonon energy with correlated states of the system , are considered . here",
    ", the included chiral @xmath64 component leads to additional scattering contributions in a@xmath31 , a@xmath38 and e@xmath32 symmetry components . from the raman tensors given above we notice that the now allowed a@xmath38 component is only observed in @xmath40 polarization as a rotational invariant contribution .",
    "it does not contribute to @xmath30 polarization at all .",
    "the spectral distribution of the raman scattering cross section derived by ko , et al . shows a broad continuum that extends up to about 600 @xmath33 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "finally , luchli et al .",
    "@xcite calculated dynamical singlet fluctuations on the kagome lattice using large - scale exact diagonalizations on a 36 site lattice .",
    "the results show a broad continuum extending over a range of 2  3@xmath62 .",
    "there is also a pronounced intensity shooting up at lowest energies , @xmath66 @xmath33 , caused by a high density of low energy singlet and triplet excitations .",
    "we can decompose the experimentally observed scattering continuum into two contributions both attributed to specific spin liquid excitations .",
    "the rotation dependence of the low energy slope ( fig .",
    "5 a ) shows in @xmath30 polarization a clear e@xmath32-like contribution , while in the @xmath40 configuration it is oval shaped , most probably a mix of both e@xmath32 and a@xmath38 symmetry . the dominance of the e@xmath32 channel at frequencies below 100 @xmath33 is in contrast to theory @xcite . the rotation dependence of the overall continuum s intensity ( fig . 5",
    "b ) shows a weak asymmetry in both @xmath30 and @xmath40 configurations for the natural and the synthesized sample .",
    "this anisotropy has no dominant four - fold contribution .",
    "however , a superposition of a four - fold and a two - fold contribution leads to a good description of the scattering intensity .",
    "we conclude that the a@xmath31 ( for @xmath30 ) and the a@xmath38 ( for @xmath40 ) symmetry channels are major contributions for the continuum at an energy of * @xmath67*. these components are proposed to be due to higher order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "comparing our experimental data in crossed polarization to the data in parallel polarization , no clear separation of the respective spectral weight is evident .",
    "this behavior is in clear contrast to the phonon raman scattering , where modes of a@xmath31 and e@xmath32 show a pronounced selection rule and different in - plane anisotropy .",
    "the observed fano - like line shape of phonons is also only observed for modes with a@xmath31 symmetry . on the other hand phonon and magnetic scattering",
    "differ within two respects that in the theoretical literature on the herbertsmithite are jointly discussed @xcite .",
    "one is related to defects , which for the local spin excitations play a different role than for * @xmath68 * optical phonons with large coherence length .",
    "the second aspect is dm interaction , which mixes singlet and triplet excitations .",
    "dm interaction and structural defects as intersite mixing will allow , further enhance and possibly mix a@xmath31 and a@xmath38 contributions , while spin defects in the plane reduce the scattering intensity . therefore , a clear assignment of contributions from the a@xmath31 , a@xmath38 and e@xmath32 channels to the background is not straight forward .",
    "still , the energy range and general shape of the observed background are in very good agreement with the above mentioned calculations of ko , et al .",
    "@xcite .    the effects of impurities in our herbertsmithite samples should be considered , and these effects should more pronounced for the natural sample ( @xmath42 ) . while keeping the kagome plane intact , cu atoms in the intermediate layer may induce lattice deformations due to jahn - teller distortion , as well as additional magnetic coupling to the kagome cu atoms .",
    "the effect of impurities in quantum spin systems with dedicated low energy excitations can be exemplified using the frustrated dimer system srcu@xmath2(bo@xmath0)@xmath2 , where 1 - 2% of zn doping on cu broadens the low energy excitations and considerably redistributes their spectral weight @xcite .",
    "this may be the reason that in contrast to theory , our experimental data do not show sharp magnetic modes or a pronounced low energy maximum . in nmr experiments on herbertsmithite",
    "it has been shown that the local susceptibility in the proximity to a defect is different and anomalous compared to the regular behavior @xcite .",
    "with respect to raman scattering it can be assumed that the excitations in the continuum that consist mainly of two - pair states @xcite ) should be reduced in intensity , comparing the natural and the synthesized sample .",
    "such a reduction of continuum scattering intensity is indeed observed , as well as a softening of about 20@xmath14 .",
    "our raman data give further evidence that the algebraic spin liquid is the ground state of the heisenberg @xmath3 kagome lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "this is based on the observation of a power law depletion of thermally induced fluctuations of the magnetic energy density with decreasing temperature and scattering continua in the low- and mid energy range .",
    "we give estimates of the contributions to these scattering continua to different symmetry components and conclude that except for the low energy continuum in @xmath30 configuration , no strong e@xmath32 contribution has been observed .",
    "our data leads to the conclusion that the kagome plane has short range and continuous correlations that form a maximum ( at @xmath67 ) with no clear cutoff but a moderate suppression at higher energy scales ( at @xmath69 ) .",
    "the overall energy range and shape of the continua agrees well with existing calculations for a spin liquid state .    presently",
    "the role of impurities in the single crystal , i.e. antisite disorder and local , defect - like interlayer interactions , is difficult to evaluate . comparing the cleaner synthesized with the natural , natural samples a weak suppression of the continuum intensity with a frequency shift is evident . as no sharp , pronounced magnetic peaks",
