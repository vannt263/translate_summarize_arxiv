    "<S> the equilibrium properties of the outer crust of cold nonaccreting magnetars ( i.e. neutron stars endowed with very strong magnetic fields ) are studied using the latest experimental atomic mass data complemented with a microscopic atomic mass model based on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method . </S>",
    "<S> the landau quantization of electron motion caused by the strong magnetic field is found to have a significant impact on the composition and the equation of state of crustal matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the outer crust of magnetars could be much more massive than that of ordinary neutron stars . </S>"
