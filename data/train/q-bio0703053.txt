    "the number of known proteins is rapidly growing and the sequence of amino acids is , at the moment , the main source of information for many new proteins which still have unidentified functions . protein sequence analysis , and more specifically , the analysis of similarities among protein sequences , is therefore the basis of studies trying to understand protein evolutionary processes or to detect unknown biological functions of new proteins . proteins with similar sequences can be found in different organisms and in a single organism , @xcite . by means of the degree of similarity obtained by a pairwise sequence comparison it is possible to deduce information about their evolutionary distance .",
    "specifically , two proteins are homologous if they evolved from a common ancestral protein sequence and , in most cases , they have also the same , or very similar , biological function .",
    "homology can be deduced from statistically significant sequence similarities . however , new sequences often have only weak similarities to known proteins , and single similarities search are insufficient to assign validated properties of characterized proteins to new sequences .",
    "instead a graph formed by all - against - all comparisons of a large amount of protein - data could become useful .",
    "this is the case of * simap *  _ similarity matrix of proteins _  a database containing the similarity space formed by almost all amino acid sequences , with nearly 5.5 million non - redundant protein sequences drawn from completely sequenced genomes and public database .",
    "moreover , pre - calculated similarity space allows very rapid access to significant hits of interest and prevents time - consuming re - computation .",
    "the algorithm that precomputes the sequences similarities is based on the fasta heuristic .",
    "first it compares low - complexity masked proteins using fasta and then it recalculates the hits found using non - masked sequences and the smith - waterman algorithm . in both phases of the alignment process",
    "the blosum50 amino acids substitution matrix is used . for each",
    "hit the smith - waterman score , the identity , the gapped identity , the overlap and the start and the stop coordinates of the alignment in both proteins are stored . for more details see @xcite .",
    "+ graphs formed by all - against - all sequence comparisons can be used to derive inheritance patterns of proteins , to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between proteins and to classify them into protein families by looking for dense clusters disconnected from the rest of the network . to date",
    ", this approach has been carefully evaluated by case studies targeted at selected protein families @xcite , but a global analysis of the complete homology network formed by all publicly available proteins has not been published .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze global and local properties of the graph forming the homology network .",
    "the information contained in the simap database can be reorganized by means of a weighted graph representation , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the set of nodes , @xmath6 the set of edges , and @xmath2 a weight function on the edges : @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "each node , @xmath8 , represents a protein sequence and each edge , @xmath9 between two nodes @xmath10 , @xmath11 represents the stored alignment between the respective protein sequences . in this way an undirected weighted graph can be obtained ,",
    "since the symmetry of the alignment procedure leads to undirected edges and the score of the alignment allows the assignment of a suitable weight to every edge .",
    "( despite the possibility of making an alignment between a protein sequence and itself , self - edges are not considered ) .",
    "more specifically if @xmath12 is the smith - waterman ( sw ) optimal score obtained with the fasta algorithm between sequence @xmath10 and @xmath11 , a suitable weight @xmath13 $ ] for the edge @xmath14 can be defined as follow : @xmath15 from @xmath16 one could define a distance function as @xmath17 , whose values are in @xmath18 $ ] as distance function usually defined on linear spaces .",
    "@xmath19 should satisfy positivity , null and simmetry properties for all pairs of sequence proteins and also the triangular inequality which is fully satisfied for the blosum50 matrix .",
    "strictly speaking , the set of all protein sequences of the simap database is not a good space over which to define the distance measure @xmath19 .",
    "there are , in fact , @xmath20 pairs of sequences that have distance equal to zero , although they are classified with a different sequence i d . however , they differ only in the presence of one or two @xmath21x@xmath21 in their amino acid sequence annotation , where @xmath21x@xmath21 is the standard symbol for an unknown amino acid residue in a protein sequence .",
    "it is therefore natural to decide to knock out , for each of these pairs of sequences , the one that has the @xmath21x@xmath21 in the sequence ; this procedure entails the removal , in the graph representation , of all edges connected to the removed nodes .",
    "another improvment for database consistency is the checking of symmetry of all edges : every time , a direct edge is found , the inverse relation , if absent , is added .    as a final result of these manipulations , a graph with @xmath22 nodes and @xmath23 edges can be constructed .    over the polished simap protein sequences space the distance @xmath24 fails the triangular inequality over few cases ( around @xmath25 of triangles ) .",
    "however redefining , for istance ,    @xmath26    we have that the triangle inequality is satisfied for all triples of linked proteins and ( [ eq : distance ] ) has all properties required for a _ distance measure_.",
    "in the simap database , protein sequences come from @xmath27 different species .",
    "there are , in particular , @xmath28 species ( _ homo sapiens _ , _ arabidopsis thaliana _ , _ rice plants _ ) with more than @xmath29 protein sequences and @xmath30 with more than @xmath31 ."
