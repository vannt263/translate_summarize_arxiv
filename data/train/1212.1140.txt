    "different flare events have been detected either in x - rays ( bade et al . 1996 ; komossa & bade 1999 ; donley et al .",
    "2002 ; esquej et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ; cappelluti et al . 2009 ; maksym et al . 2010 ) or in the uv region ( gezari et al . 2006 , 2009 ) . these sudden variations in the electromagnetic emission of  quiet \" galaxies",
    "have been interpreted as being the consequence of the tidal disruption of a star that has passed close to a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) living in a  dormant \" state in the center of its host galaxy . for a near parabolic orbit",
    "in which the periapse distance @xmath10 is shorter than the tidal radius @xmath11 , tidal disruption is likely to occur and two distinct phases in the dynamical evolution of the debris can be distinguished . in the first , the  fallback \" phase , nearly half of the debris is in gas streams having approximately ballistic trajectories , which converge and collide at periapse , dissipating energy through shocks .",
    "typically , for a black hole of mass @xmath12  m@xmath4 and a disrupted star of @xmath13 the released energy in this phase is about @xmath14 erg . since the dissipated energy in these shocks scales as @xmath15 , in our case , as we shall see below ,",
    "this is expected to be one order of magnitude less than the  disk - phase . as the bound material converges at periapse and dissipates energy ,",
    "a small accretion disk is formed and the second phase initiates as soon as the black hole begins to accrete mass , which coincides with the instant of maximum in the light curve .",
    "this is dictated by the viscous mechanism that controls the angular momentum transfer , fixing the timescale in which the material is conveyed from the outer regions of the disk to the last stable orbit . in this  disk \"- phase ,",
    "most of the flare energy is radiated .",
    "non - steady accretion disk models have recently been built by montesinos & de freitas pacheco ( 2011a , b , hereafter mp11a and mp11b ) by solving numerically the hydrodynamic and the energy transfer equations .",
    "these models are able to explain the sudden variation of the x - ray emission observed in non - active galaxies that are supposed to be related to tidal events like those observed in ngc 3599 or ic 3599 .",
    "more recently , gezari et al . (",
    "2012 ) reported an uv - optical flare that has occurred in a non - active galaxy at @xmath16 and which was probably originated in a tidal disruption event .",
    "this flare event discovered in the pan - starrs1 survey displays some particular characteristics like : a ) the lack of hydrogen lines in the spectra and the presence of a broad heii@xmath174686    emission line suggest that the disrupted star lost its outer envelope and can probably be identified with the he - rich core of an ancient red giant ; b ) no detectable x - rays emission by chandra ; c ) from the analysis of the continuum emission , the estimated disk temperature is considerably lower than those attributed to disks associated usually with x - ray flare events .",
    "we report here the results obtained from a series of models computed with our code , aiming to reproduce the observed light curve in different wavelengths and to derive the main parameters characterizing the event .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations describing the disk evolution can be found in mp11a and mp11b respectively but , in a few words , we recall here the basic features .",
    "the code is based on an eulerian formalism using a finite difference method of second - order , according to the van leer upwind algorithm on a staggered mesh .",
    "since the disks considered here are quite small , we have adopted an integration grid of 256 ring sectors instead of the original 1024 rings adopted in mp11a .",
    "the inner radius of the grid coincides with the last stable orbit while the external radius is defined by the tidal radius @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the mass and radius of the disrupted star and @xmath21 is the black hole mass .",
    "notice that generally in the literature the parameter @xmath22 is taken to be equal to unity .",
    "in fact , the work by luminet & carter ( 1986 ) suggests that @xmath22 = 2.4 , which corresponds to the roche limit for a fluid body in a circular orbit .",
    "more recent investigations of the fly - by problem for a viscous fluid body in a parabolic orbit suggest an effective roche limit ( @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 ( sridhar & tremaine 1992 ; kosovichev & novikov 1992 ) . in particular , the latter authors considered the case in which the disturbing body is a massive black hole as in the present case .",
    "thus , the value @xmath24 will be adopted in our grid of models .",
    "this implies that in our models the most bound material returns to periapse after a timescale @xmath25 that is about 4.8 times higher than the case @xmath22=1 . as we shall see later",
    ", this explains why gezari et al .",
    "( 2012 ) concluded that the disruption occurred only @xmath26 76 days before maximum light while our preferred model indicates a higher timescale , namely , 1.24 years .",
    "the original mp11a boundary conditions were also modified to allow an inflow of matter at the external ring , corresponding to the material that circularizes after shocks between converging streams .    also as in mp11a , it was assumed that the gravitational field of the black hole is given by the approximate potential of paczynski - wiita ( paczynski & wiita 1980 ) that gives correctly the position of the last stable orbit for the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the present model the angular momentum transfer is not described by the so - called ",
    "@xmath27\"-model introduced by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "the viscosity coefficient is that given by the approach of de freitas pacheco & steiner ( 1976 ) , i.e. , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the radial distance to center of the disk , @xmath30 is the azimuthal velocity of the debris at that distance and @xmath6 is the critical reynolds number characterizing the flow .",
    "another important aspect concerns the fallback rate . according to early investigations (",
    "rees 1988 ; evans & kochanek 1989 ) , in a first approximation , the fallback rate @xmath31 is given by the relation @xmath32 where @xmath33 however , more detailed studies ( lodato et al . 2009 ) based on simulations indicate deviations from eq.[fb1 ] at early phases of the fallback process .",
    "in fact , only in the late evolutionary stages the fallback rate varies as @xmath34 .",
    "as in mp11b , we have attempted to include these deviations by modifying eq.[fb1 ] as @xmath35}. \\label{fb2}\\ ] ] in the above equation @xmath36 is a normalization constant ( see mp11a for details ) and @xmath25 is still given by eq.[tmin ] .",
    "notice that the dimensionless parameter @xmath37 permits to control the instant at which the maximum fallback rate occurs .",
    "a series of models were computed in which the different parameters were varied , searching for a best representation of data , namely , the light curves of the flare in different wavelengths . in all models",
    ", we assumed that the disrupted star is a he - rich core of 0.23 @xmath38 and a radius of 0.33 @xmath39 as in gezari et al .",
    "our preferred model is characterized by a black hole of mass @xmath3 @xmath38 , a fallback parameter @xmath40 and a critical reynolds number @xmath5 .",
    "notice that this value is higher than those characterizing our previous models ( mp11b ) but is necessary to get a  colder \" disk",
    ". a higher value of @xmath6 decreases the local dissipation of kinetic energy , producing lower temperatures and consequently , increasing the energy inflow by advection .",
    "contrary what is generally assumed in the literature , the beginning of the accretion process by the black hole does not coincide with the beginning of the circularization process or , in other words , with the beginning of the formation of the accretion disk . this is simply because it takes a finite time for the debris to be transported from the outer regions down to the inner region ( last stable orbit ) due to the angular momentum transfer mechanism .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig.1 where the evolution of the fallback rate is compared with the evolution of the accretion rate by the black hole .",
    "the very initial peak in the accretion rate occurs ( for our preferred model ) about 44.8 days after the onset of the circularization process and coincides also with the maximum in the light curve .",
    "the mass of the gravitationally bound debris is about 0.115 @xmath38 , corresponding to a half of the mass of the disrupted star , but a small fraction ( about 15% ) is not accreted by the black hole , escaping from the system and taking away the angular momentum stored in the disk .",
    "the continuous emission of the flare is generally fitted by a black - body distribution characterized by an effective temperature . in reality",
    ", the local effective temperature varies along the disk surface with a radial profile that evolves in time .",
    "mp11b defined a suitable mean effective temperature , which corresponds to an effective energy flux that multiplied by the total disk surface gives the luminosity .",
    "such a mean effective temperature is computed from the relation @xmath41        the evolution of the mean effective temperature is shown in fig.2 . the maximum value ( @xmath26 39400 k ) coincides with maximum light ( and maximum accretion rate by the black hole ) .",
    "after approximately 25 days the mean effective temperature of the disk drops to about 25000 k and then decreases more or less steadly at a rate of @xmath42 .",
    "the model predicts at maximum light and near the central region a  true \" temperature around 65000 k. one month after maximum , in the inner region , the temperature has decreased to about 31000 k while in the outskirts of the disk it remains at a value around 20000 k. figure 3 shows different snapshots of the temperature profile before , at and after maximum light .        in figure 4 ,",
    "the bolometric light curve is shown .",
    "as already mentioned , before maximum light the black hole is not yet accreting matter and the radiation comes from viscous dissipation in the disk that is still being formed . integrating the bolometric luminosity over time allows an estimation for the total radiated energy , i.e. , @xmath9 erg , in agreement with the lower limit estimated by gezari et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , based on a black - body spectrum characterized by a temperature @xmath43 30 000 k. taking into account the total amount of mass accreted by the black hole , the mean efficiency for the energy conversion is @xmath44 .            the resulting spectrum at maximum is shown in fig . 5 in comparison with the expected spectrum of a black body characterized by the mean effective temperature",
    "as mp11b have shown , the black body approximation underestimates the emitted flux at short wavelengths ( @xmath45 1000  ) but predicts correctly fluxes at longer wavelengths .",
    "filter , middle panel to @xmath1 , and the lower one to @xmath2.,width=283,height=491 ]    the light curve in filters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are shown respectively in the upper , middle and lower panels of figure 6 .",
    "data points are those given by gezari et al .",
    "according to these authors , who have adopted the models by lodato et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , systematic differences are present between data and theoretical light curves during the early rise and the late decay .",
    "the present model explains quite well both the raising part of the light curve and the early decay phase .",
    "the former is produced while the disk is still being formed and the black hole is not yet accreting mass .",
    "the early decay , just after maximum does not vary as @xmath34 as usually claimed but varies faster , decreasing by about one magnitude per week .",
    "the late evolution of the theoretical light curve displays the aforementioned behaviour , i.e. , @xmath46 although data in the @xmath2 filter ( lower panel ) @xmath26 40 days after maximum are slightly below the predicted values but still consistent taking into account the observational errors .",
    "the transient event discovered on 2010 may 28 by the pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ) medium deep survey was probably originated in a tidal disruption event . according to gezari et al .",
    "( 2012 ) the disrupted star was a helium - rich core resulting from the evolution of a red giant .",
    "we have used our hydrodynamic code ( mp11a , mp11b ) to compute the radiation of the bound debris during the phase in which a small accretion disk is formed and during which most of the flare energy is produced .",
    "our preferred model requires that the central black hole has a mass of @xmath3 m@xmath47 almost a factor 2.3 higher than that estimated by gezari et al .",
    "( 2012 ) but in good agreement with the relation between the black hole mass and the stellar mass of the host galaxy .",
    "no significant x - ray emission related to the flare was detected , consistent with the temperature of @xmath26 35 000 k estimated by gezari et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that is necessary to produce enough uv photons to ionize helium .",
    "our model predicts at maximum and near the inner region of the disk a temperature of 65 000 k , which is a consequence of a high critical reynolds number ( @xmath48 ) characterizing the turbulent state of the gas .",
    "this is about 20 times the @xmath6 values defining our previous models ( mp11b ) , in which an important x - ray emission is present .",
    "notice that in our model the heating rate per unit volume @xmath49 due to viscosity is given by the equation @xmath50 that shows why a higher critical reynolds number or a lower viscosity decreases the heating rate and , consequently , the disk temperature .    the most important difference with the analysis by gezari et al .",
    "( 2012 ) concerns the chronology of the event , which results from the adopted value for the dimensionless parameter @xmath22 defining the tidal radius .",
    "if @xmath51 1.69 and not one , then the disruption of the star occurred about 1.24 yr before maximum light and the beginning of the circularization process , about 44.7 days before the peak .",
    "we emphasize once more that the beginning of circularization does nt coincide with the beginning of the accretion process by the black hole .",
    "contrary to the models adopted by gezari et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the present model provides a good representation of the initial raise of the light curve , when the black hole is not yet accreting and the disk is being filling up , as well as of the initial light decay , which evolves faster than @xmath52 .",
    "detailed analyses of tidal disruption events provide an excelent tool to study dormant black holes and the physics of non - steady accretion disk , in particular of the mechanisms reponsible for the angular momentum transfer and energy dissipation .",
