    "the influence of dimensionality and lattice geometry on the electronic structure of crystals is a classical topic in solid state physics .",
    "however , in the presence of strong electronic correlations like those observed in the high-@xmath4 superconducting cuprates , the theoretical analysis of electronic properties is especially difficult .",
    "recently , the electronic structure of various undoped cuprates has been studied experimentally using core - level x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) .",
    "@xcite by comparing these spectra to the results of theoretical model calculations we can try to improve our understanding of the electronic properties of the cuprates . in addition , a theoretical analysis allows us to check the validity of the microscopic models used for the calculations , and it provides values for the physical parameters which are contained in the model hamiltonians .",
    "the core - level photoemission process leads to a final state in which an electron is missing in the @xmath0 core orbital of a cu site .",
    "the resulting positive charge is screened by valence electrons , predominantly from cu @xmath5 and o @xmath6 orbitals . the contribution of these screening processes to the final state determines the detailed form of the experimental spectrum .",
    "therefore , core - level spectra contain information about the dynamics of valence electrons .",
    "since the atomic ground state of the cu - o system is a @xmath7 configuration , it is advantageous to use the hole picture . in this case",
    "the core - level photoemission process amounts to the creation of a core hole which has a strong repulsive coulomb interaction with the valence hole in the @xmath5 orbital of the same cu site .",
    "experimentally , the cu @xmath8 core - level spectrum of many formally divalent cu compounds shows a dominant main line and a pronounced satellite structure.@xcite in analogy to an approach for metals , @xcite this satellite structure was assigned to a ( `` poorly screened '' ) final state ( denoted @xmath9 ) in which the valence hole largely remains on the cu site.@xcite in this way , the structure of the satellite could be explained by multiplet splitting due to the remaining @xmath10-hole.@xcite    the main line was interpreted as originating from a final state in which the hole resides in the neighbouring ligands ( denoted @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , for several compounds the main line is found to be asymmetric , and to have a large width .",
    "for instance , three substructures were identified in the main line of bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath12@xcite and sr@xmath3cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 @xcite ( which will be analyzed in this paper ) .",
    "substructures of this kind are the reason why the main line in the cu @xmath0 spectra can not be attributed to a local @xmath11 excitation only : this interpretation does not account for the asymmetry and the large width of the main line .    an alternative explanation was found using numerical exact diagonalization for a chain of three plaquettes ( cu@xmath2o@xmath13).@xcite it was shown that the valence hole could delocalize further in the crystal .",
    "this leads to a lowest eigenstate of @xmath11 character , in which the hole is mainly pushed out onto the neighbouring cuo@xmath1 units , forming a zhang - rice singlet.@xcite these delocalization processes in the hole picture are equivalent to the screening processes in the electron picture .",
    "obviously , this screening of the core hole depends on the geometry of the cuo network.@xcite this suggests the possibility of finite - size effects in cluster calculations.@xcite in fact , convergence of the spectra with respect to the system size was found only for chain clusters with lengths of seven plaquettes ( cu@xmath14o@xmath15).@xcite these calculations led to a satisfactory agreement with the experimental results for sr@xmath3cuo@xmath2.@xcite    another popular model for the description of core - level spectroscopy is the single - site anderson impurity model.@xcite recently , the influence of dimensionality on cu @xmath0 spectra of several cuprates was analyzed using this model.@xcite overall , very good agreement with the experimental main lines was obtained .",
    "the satellite structures , however , were not discussed . in particular ,",
    "no multiplet effects were included .",
    "furthermore , the absolute energetical positions of the main lines of sr@xmath3cuo@xmath2 and sr@xmath3cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 were not correctly reproduced .",
    "these shortcomings are avoided in our treatment .    in the present paper , we discuss the influence of of the dimensionality on the cu @xmath0 core level spectra of undoped cuprates by means of the mori - zwanzig projection technique . both exchange splitting and delocalization properties are described within one framework using a multi - band hubbard model .",
    "in addition , a clear description of the final states is obtained .",
    "our analysis allows to distinguish between effects of the cu - o geometry and effects from material - specific properties .",
    "examples for material - specific properties are the cu - o distance or components which do not belong to the cu - o network .",
    "some of these properties are described by the values of model parameters like the cu - o charge - transfer energy or the cu - o hybridization strength .",
    "a phenomenological analysis can not conclusively determine whether an effect is due to dimensionality or not .",
    "for instance , due to differences in material - specific properties a peak which is brought about by a similar process in two different compounds may not appear at the same binding energy in both spectra .",
    "therefore , the investigation of microscopic models is necessary .",
    "we compare our calculations with the experimental spectra of three materials which consist of different cu - o networks : bi@xmath3cuo@xmath1 which contains separated cuo@xmath1 plaquettes  @xcite ( `` zero''-dimensional cu - o@xmath1 network ) , sr@xmath3cuo@xmath2 where the plaquettes form linear chains  @xcite ( one - dimensional cu - o@xmath2 network ) , and sr@xmath3cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 which contains cuo@xmath3 planes  @xcite ( two - dimensional cu - o@xmath3 network ) .    in the case of zero - dimensional",
    "edge - shared or separated plaquettes ( like bi@xmath3cuo@xmath1 ) the main line consists of a single feature which is explained by a local process in which the valence hole moves from the core - hole site to the surrounding o sites .",
    "@xcite for one - dimensional zigzag or linear chains ( like sr@xmath16cuo@xmath2 ) two features contribute to the main line . in the case of two - dimensional planar systems ( like sr@xmath3cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 ) the main line is composed of at least three features .",
    "in addition to these effects there is an interesting trend in the intensity ratio @xmath17 between the satellite and the main line . for zero - dimensional systems",
    "this ratio is rather large , e.g.  @xmath18 for bi@xmath3cuo@xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of one - dimensional networks the ratio is small , for instance @xmath19 for sr@xmath3cuo@xmath2 .",

    "the delocalization properties of the most important final states are shown in the lower part of fig.5 .",

    "nevertheless the final states obtained for a cuo@xmath3 plane are rather similar to those of the lower dimensional systems . for state ( a )",
    "this is easy to explain by the local nature of the satellite peak .",
    "the fact that the delocalization in states ( b ) and ( c ) is not significantly larger in two dimensions than in one dimension is , on the other hand , somewhat surprising .",
    "key element in the explanation of this effect are the four cu sites which are the diagonal nearest neighbors of the core - hole site ( cf .  the lower part of fig .  5 ) . due to antiferromagnetic correlations these diagonal cu sites",
    "are predominantly occupied by valence holes which have the same spin direction as the valence hole on the core - hole site .",
    "therefore , due to the pauli principle the holes from the diagonal cu sites suppress fluctuations of the valence hole from the core - hole site .",
    "the increase of charge fluctuations due to the higher dimensionality is largely compensated by this suppression .",
    "an analogous effect has already been found to be important for the ground - state charge properties of hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) .",
    "@xcite    it is interesting to compare the results of the projection technique with exact diagonalization calculations ( without multiplet splitting ) of a cu@xmath113o@xmath114 cluster from refs .  .",
    "this cluster contains five plaquettes in a cross - like configuration where the central cu site is the core - hole site .",
    "notice that the cu@xmath113o@xmath114 system does not contain the diagonal cu sites which , as discussed above , suppress fluctuations from the central cu site .",
    "therefore one expects this system to display features of artificially strong delocalization like , e.g. , a reduced ratio @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , while the diagonalization shows a similar shoulder structure as the projection technique , cf .",
    "fig .  4 , the intensity of this shoulder , its separation from the lowest - energy line as well as the ratio @xmath17 are smaller .",
    "the slightly reduced value @xmath111 for the cu - o hopping strength which leads to the spectrum shown in fig .  5 may be explained by the larger cu - o distance in sr@xmath3cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 compared to la@xmath3cuo@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the agreement of the theoretical result with the experimental spectrum is still not satisfactory .",
    "the calculated main line is dominated by two features , and at least one excitation seems to be missing in the region around @xmath110 binding energy .",
    "notice , that in the theoretical main line of sr@xmath3cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 from ref .",

    "orbitals which are not yet taken into account are , for example , non - planar orbitals in the cuo@xmath3 system , like the cu @xmath115 orbital . however , in view of the good agreement with the experiments shown in figs .  2 and 3",

    "6 where we show results of the projection technique for zero- , one- and two - dimensional cu - o networks .",
    "since the same parameter set ( [ values ] ) has been used for all geometries , all changes in the spectra are exclusively due to dimensionality effects .",
    "the most important effect in the spectra is that for the one- and two - dimensional system an additional excitation appears at lower binding energies .",
    "as discussed above the final states of this excitation are delocalized and rather similar for both the one- and the two - dimensional structures , see states ( c ) in figs .  3 and 5 .",
    "overall , there is only a quantitative change from one to two dimensions , in contrast to the qualitative change observed between zero and higher dimensions .",
    "this conclusion is in principal agreement with results of exact diagonalization calculations.@xcite the peak around @xmath110 binding energy which dominates the main line in the case of zero dimensions becomes a shoulder structure which decreases in intensity and shifts towards higher binding energies as the dimensionality increases .",
    "nevertheless , the final state associated with this peak preserves its main properties ( a large valence - hole density at the o sites around the core - hole site ) with changing dimensionality , see states ( a ) in figs .  2 , 3 , and 5 .",
    "as the dimensionality increases the delocalization in the cu - o network increases .",
    "therefore one observes a monotonic decrease in the ratio @xmath17 for increasing dimensions .",
    "since this trend is not observed experimentally , the actual value of @xmath17 has to depend mainly on material - specific properties . in our calculation these properties",
    "are reflected by the values of the model parameters , cf . figs .",
    "summing up , we have calculated the cu @xmath0 core - level spectra of zero- one- and two - dimensional cu - o networks using a model hamiltonian which describes exchange splitting and delocalization within one framework .",
    "the spectral intensity has been obtained using the mori - zwanzig projection technique .",
    "this method leads to the exact solution for a single cuo@xmath1 plaquette , and we observe excellent convergence in the case of an infinite cuo@xmath2 chain and an infinite cuo@xmath3 plane .",
    "the delocalization properties of the final states obtained in the calculation are easy to interpret .",

    "an analysis of the influence of dimensionality effects , as compared to effects due to material - specific properties , indicates that this missing feature may be due to orbitals which are not contained in the model .",
