    "simple models of the collapse and subsequent formation of virialized systems predict that such objects will exhibit self - similarity in their behaviour ( e.g. navarro et al .",
    "shock heating of the intracluster gas , driven by gravitational infall , establishes the x - ray properties of these systems , such that they scale simply with the total mass of the halo .",
    "this leads to the expectation of a constant , universal gas fraction in virialized systems .",
    "additionally , assuming haloes form from material of fixed density , a number of well defined scaling relations can be derived",
    ".    however , it is now clear that the presence of additional physics is required to provide a more complete picture of the state of the gas .",
    "the well studied relation between x - ray luminosity and mean temperature exhibits a logarithmic slope steeper than expected ( @xmath0 ) in clusters ( e.g. edge & stewart 1991 ; arnaud & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "further steepening is observed at group scales ( e.g. helsdon & ponman 2000 ) .",
    "recent work has focused on the role of non - gravitational heating ( e.g. babul et al . 1999 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ) and radiative cooling ( e.g. muanwong et al . 2001 ; voit & bryan 2001 ) of the gas in explaining the observed departures from self - similarity .    however , existing observations have been unable to discriminate between these competing theories , since both heating and cooling of gas can give rise to a reduction in central density and a suppression of x - ray luminosity in the central regions of cooler systems . in this short paper",
    "we present an overview of an ongoing project to study a large sample of virialized systems , in order to establish their scaling properties and address the issue of self - similarity breaking and its causes .",
    "our sample incorporates rich clusters of galaxies , through groups and included two galaxy - sized haloes , comprising 66 objects in total . for each system",
    "we have fitted analytical profiles to describe the deprojected density and temperature of the intracluster medium ( icm ) as a function of radius .",
    "we have excluded from our sample those systems with obvious evidence of x - ray substructure , where the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is not reasonable . the redshift range spanned is @xmath2 0.00360.208 ( 0.035 median ) .",
    "our analysis combines three existing samples , based on _ rosat _ and _ asca _ data , and a detailed description of our method can be found in sanderson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . with these data we are able to determine the gravitating mass profile , virial radius and other derived quantities in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "for a subset of 32 groups and clusters , we have also measured the distribution of the galaxies themselves ( using the apm catalogue ) , allowing us to calculate the stellar mass contribution ( sanderson & ponman 2003b ) .",
    "we convert optical light to stellar mass , assuming a mass - to - light ratio for early - type galaxies of 7  @xmath3 solar in the @xmath4 band ( pizzella et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "there is a strong ( 6@xmath5 ) trend in gas fraction within 0.3r@xmath6 with system temperature ( left panel , figure  [ fig : fgas_mlr ] ) , implying that groups and cool clusters are not self - similar compared to rich clusters .",
    "this depletion of gas in cooler systems could be due to :    * preheating : the energetically boosted icm is progressively more weakly captured by the less massive haloes of cooler systems * radiative cooling : gas drops out to form stars ; a process which is more efficient in the cooler & denser icm of groups .    from our optical analysis",
    "we have derived the @xmath7 band mass - to - light ratio for a subset of 32 groups and clusters , which is plotted against x - ray temperature in the right panel of figure  [ fig : fgas_mlr ] .",
    "the red solid line represents the best fitting power law , which has a logarithmic slope of @xmath8 .",
    "the black dotted line shows the median value for the sample , of 249@xmath3 @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that there is no significant trend in @xmath10 , indicating that star formation efficiency does not vary substantially with halo mass .",
    "the x - ray data enable both the gas and total mass density profiles to be determined .",
    "our optical sub - sample yields the stellar baryon contribution , and therefore allows the dark matter distribution to be inferred .",
    "density profiles for the individual cluster mass components are plotted in figure  [ fig : rho(r ) ] as a function of scaled radius ( i.e. normalized to our nominal virial radius , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the profiles have been grouped into five temperature bands for clarity , with approximately the same number of profiles in each band .",
    "the dark matter is the most self - similar component , showing no systematic trend with temperature , but for an enhancement in central concentration within @xmath12 for the coolest temperature band ( 0.32.0  kev ) .",
    "the intracluster gas is clearly not self - similar and shows a significant decrease in density with decreasing temperature .",
    "the stellar distribution shows a surprisingly self - similar shape across the sample , with a small spread in normalization ; there is some evidence for a mild enhancement in the stellar density in the two coolest bands .",
    "comparison between the three panels in figure  [ fig : rho(r ) ] reveals that the gas is the most spatially extended mass component , followed by the stars and dark matter , in agreement with the findings of david et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "since entropy is conserved in any adiabatic process , it serves as an excellent probe of non - gravitational physics , increasing in proportion to the virial temperature of a cluster for the self - similar case .",
    "it is defined , for convenience , as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electron number density of the gas and @xmath15 is its temperature .",
    "the entropy at a fiducial radius of 0.1r@xmath6 is plotted against system temperature in the left panel of figure  [ fig : entropy ] .",
    "the solid green line is the best fit to the data , which has a logarithmic slope of @xmath16 .",
    "this relation is significantly shallower than the self - similar slope of unity , normalized to the mean of the hottest 8 clusters and plotted as the solid black line . the entropy",

    "( 2000 ) is shown as the magenta horizontal line , but it is not clear if this represents a true lower limit to the entropy in galaxy groups , since the overall trend is flatter than @xmath19 for all temperatures . in general , the data appear to be more consistent with radiative cooling models ( e.g. voit & bryan 2001 ) than preheating ones , which predict @xmath19 for more massive clusters .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : entropy ] shows entropy ( scaled by mean temperature ) as a function of radius for the sample , grouped into five temperature bands to suppress scatter .",
    "the shape of the profiles is broadly similar , but they are shifted in normalization such that the cooler systems posses a higher scaled entropy .",
    "however , there is no evidence for a large isentropic core in any of the profiles , which would be expected if the extra entropy was injected by some non - gravitational heating mechanism ( e.g. balogh et al .",
    "these findings are confirmed by a recent analysis of two galaxy groups using _ xmm - newton _ ; mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find no evidence for an entropy floor within @xmath20 , which would otherwise be expected if their hot gas had been preheated prior to virialization .",
    "furthermore , it is clear from the right panel of figure  [ fig : entropy ] that the excess entropy is present _ at all radii _ , and not just in the central regions .",
    "however , for all the profiles , the entropy in the outskirts of the halo appears consistent with the expectations of shock heating of accreting gas , which lead to a logarithmic slope of 1.1 ( tozzi & norman 2001 ) , as shown by the black solid line in the right panel of figure  [ fig : entropy ] .",
    "we have studied the scaling properties of a large sample of virialized systems , spanning a wide range of mass .",
    "we find clear evidence of a departure from self - similarity in the properties of the hot gas in these systems : groups have substantially lower gas fractions than clusters , and there is evidence of excess entropy in the intracluster medium on all mass scales .",
    "our entropy results are inconsistent with the predictions of preheating models , and provide a better match to models incorporating the effects of radiative cooling and feedback from subsequent star formation",
    ".    however , we do not find significant variation in mass - to - light ratio with mass , implying that star formation efficiency is not greatly enhanced in groups .",
    "this demonstrates that radiative cooling can not be the only mechanism responsible for the departure from self - similarity ; non - gravitational heating of the gas must also have had some influence ."
