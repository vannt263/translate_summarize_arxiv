    "quantum teleportation is not only of practical values but also of theoretical interest because it contains many illuminating manifestations of quantum physics , clarifying fundamental issues such as quantum information and classical information , quantum nonlocality and relativistic locality , spacelike correlations and causality , and so on @xcite .",
    "the first scheme of quantum teleportation is proposed by bennett , brassard , crepeau , jozsa , peres , and wootters ( bbcjpw ) @xcite , where an _ unknown _ state of a qubit @xmath0 is teleported from one spatially localized agent alice to another agent bob using an entangled pair of qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 prepared in one of the bell states and shared by alice and bob , respectively .",
    "such an idea is then adapted to the systems with continuous variables such as harmonic oscillators by vaidman @xcite , who introduces an epr state @xcite for the shared entangled pair to teleport an unknown coherent state .",
    "braunstein and kimble ( bk ) @xcite generalized vaidman s scheme from epr states with exact correlations to squeezed coherent states . in doing so the uncertainty of the measurable quantities",
    "has to be considered , which reduces the degree of entanglement of the @xmath3-pair as well as the fidelity of teleportation .",
    "since quantum teleportation can address the issues of nonlocality and causality , it is natural to consider quantum teleportation in fully relativistic systems and in non - inertial frames . alsing and milburn made the first attempt of calculating the fidelity of quantum teleportation between two moving cavities in relativistic motions @xcite",
    " one is at rest ( alice ) , the other is uniformly accelerated ( rob , for relativistic motion ) in the minkowski frame  though their process of teleportation is not complete and the result is not quite reliable @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "one of us @xcite has considered quantum teleportation in the unruh - dewitt ( ud ) detector theory @xcite with the agents in similar motions but based on the bk scheme : an unknown coherent state of an ud detector @xmath0 is teleported from alice to rob using an entangled pair of the ud detectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 initially in a two - mode squeezed state and held by alice and rob , respectively . while both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are coupled with a common massless quantum field initially in the minkowski vacuum ,",
    "the detector @xmath0 is isolated from the environment to identify the best fidelity that @xmath1 and @xmath2 moving in a common environment can offer .    unfortunately , the fidelity of quantum teleportation considered in @xcite is not a physical one .",
    "more careful consideration of the relativistic effects of quantum information associated with the quantum field is needed to get the correct results , which we do in this paper .",
    "there are many subtle issues related to quantum teleportation in relativistic systems which play an important role but have hitherto been largely ignored .",
    "foremost , it is crucial that bob or rob has to have the full knowledge about the quantum state of the @xmath3-pair to achieve quantum teleportation perfectly .",
    "for example , in the bbcjpw scheme , alice performs a bell measurement jointly on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which collapses the @xmath4-pair into one of the bell states , then sends the information to bob classically about which bell state the @xmath4-pair ends up in . according to this classical information bob can reproduce the initial state of @xmath0 by operating on @xmath2 .",
    "bob s  manual \" in how to connect each kind of received information ( the outcome of measurement on the @xmath4-pair ) with some specific set of operations on @xmath2 is determined by the quantum state of the @xmath3-pair right before the joint measurement by alice .",
    "if the quantum state of the entangled @xmath3-pair is changed from their initial state , then bob s  manual \" must be changed accordingly to keep the fidelity of quantum teleportation perfect .",
    "second , categorically there seems to be a common misunderstanding or underestimation of _ relativistic effects _ in quantum information .",
    "many people may think of  relativistic \" as referring to fast motion of the atoms ( qubits ) or oscillators ( detectors ) , which is not commonly encountered , but forget about the fact that a quantum field which is ever present in any setup is relativistic , namely that the laws of special relativity govern the field and hence enter in the interaction between the qubits or detectors even when there is no direct interaction amongst them .",
    "this oversight is largely due to the focus of quantum foundational issues from the viewpoint of quantum mechanics , which is only an approximation  the nonrelativistic limit  to the consistent theory , which is quantum field theory .",
    "third , which is related to the second , is the neglect of _ environmental influences_. the presence of a quantum field is unavoidable and acts as an ubiquitous environment to the qubits or detectors in question ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath0 described in the context of quantum teleportation above ) whose effects need to be included in one s consideration .",
    "they include :    [ [ quantum - decoherence ] ] quantum decoherence",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    each qubit or oscillator can be decohered by coupling to a quantum field , but decoherence can be lessened if the two qubits are placed in close range due to mutual influences mediated by the field ;    [ [ entanglement - dynamics ] ] entanglement dynamics + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the entanglement between two qubits or oscillators changes in time as their reduced state evolves ;    [ [ unruh - effect ] ] unruh effect + + + + + + + + + + + +    a pointlike object such as a ud detector coupled with a quantum field and uniformly accelerated in the minkowski vacuum of that quantum field would experience a thermal bath of the field quanta at the unruh temperature proportional to its proper acceleration .",
    "furthermore , objects in a relativistic system may behave differently when observed in different reference frames :    [ [ frame - dependence ] ] frame dependence + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    since quantum entanglement between two spatially localized degrees of freedom is a kind of spacelike correlation in a quantum state , which depends on reference frames , quantum entanglement of two localized objects but separated in space is frame - dependent ;    [ [ time - dilation ] ] time dilation + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for two moving objects localized in space and so parameterized by their proper times , the time dilations of them observed in the rest frame will naturally enter the dynamics of entanglement between them .",
    "the above factors have been considered in some detail @xcite .",
    "but there are new issues of foundational value which need be included in the consideration of quantum teleportation .",
    "we mention two such issues related to open quantum systems below .",
    "as indicated in the bk scheme , fidelity of quantum teleportation could depend on ( i ) quantum entanglement of the @xmath3-pair , and ( ii ) the consistency of the quantum state of the @xmath3-pair with their initial state .",
    "both would be reduced by the coupling with an environment , the quantum field being an ubiquitous one .",
    "we will compare the time evolution of the logarithmic negativity of the @xmath3-pair in a given reference frame and the fidelities of quantum teleportation in the same frame to distinguish the effects caused by these two factors .    for simplicity and for the purpose of comparing the degree of entanglement of the @xmath3-pair and the fidelity of quantum teleportation ,",
    "one of us @xcite considered the  pseudo - fidelity \" of teleportation by imagining that right at the moment the joint measurement on the @xmath4-pair was done by alice , rob gets the information of the outcome from alice instantaneously and performs proper local operations on @xmath2 accordingly . in reality classical information need some time to travel from alice to rob , and during the traveling time of the signal detector @xmath2 keeps evolving , so we expect the physical fidelity of teleportation will be further reduced . our calculation verifies this feature .",
    "quantum states make sense only in a given frame where a hamiltonian is well defined @xcite .",
    "two quantum states of the same system with quantum fields in different frames are comparable only on those totally overlapping time - slices associated with certain moments in each frame . by a measurement local in space ,",
    "e.g. on a point - like ud detector coupled with a quantum field , quantum states ( of the combined system ) in different frames can be interpreted as if they collapsed on different time - slices passing through the same measurement event .",
    "nevertheless , the post - measurement states will evolve to the same state up to a coordinate transformation when they are compared at some time - slice in the future @xcite .",
    "given the consistency of instantaneous measurement , we can further study the evolution of fidelities of teleportation in different frames . although they do nt have to agree with each other if the time - slices of those different frames never overlap ( except for the fiducial time - slice where the initial state is defined ) , we will show that the reduced state of the qubit or detector @xmath2 after wave functional collapse in different frames will become consistent once rob enters the future lightcone of the joint measurement event by alice . to calculate the physical fidelity ,",
    "we find it the most convenient to collapse the wave functional of the combined system almost on the future lightcone of the local measurement event by alice so the continuous evolution during the moment of wave functional collapse and the local operation by rob can be neglected in the cases with negligible mutual influences .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model we use for addressing these issues .",
    "in section iii we review the definition of the averaged pseudo - fidelity and calculate the pseudo - fidelities in the ultraweak coupling limit in different frames ; we then illustrate some results beyond the ultraweak coupling limit . in section",
    "iv we modify the setup and calculate the averaged physical fidelity for a more realistic case in the ultraweak coupling limit .",
    "we then summarize our findings in section v. in appendix a we show explicitly that quantum entanglement of the @xmath3-pair is a necessary condition for the best fidelity of quantum teleportation beating the best classical fidelity in the ultraweak coupling limit of our model .",
    "finally a short discussion on nonlocality and causality is given in appendix b.",
    "to address the above issues , we consider three identical unruh - dewitt detectors @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 with mass @xmath5 and natural frequency @xmath6 , moving in a quantum field in ( 3 + 1)d minkowski space . the action of the combined system is given by @xcite @xmath7      + \\lambda_0\\int d^4 x       q_{\\bf d}(\\tau_{\\bf d})\\phi ( x)\\delta^4\\left(x^{\\mu}-z_{\\bf d}^{\\mu}(\\tau_{\\bf d})\\right)\\right\\ } ,    \\label{stot1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are proper times for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",

    "the gaussian reduced state of the detector @xmath2 consists of the two - point correlators of @xmath15 and @xmath413 .",
    "it has a sudden change from the uncollapsed to the collapsed one at @xmath325 in fig .",
    "[ ar ] , as observed in the conventional minkowski frame , or at @xmath326 , as observed in the quasi - rindler frame .",
    "such a sudden change occurs at different spacetime points for different observers . in other words ,",
    "when observed at some moment @xmath414 before rob enters the future lightcone of the joint measurement event , those correlators of @xmath2 may either be in the uncollapsed form or the collapsed form , with the two - point correlators look like @xmath415 or @xmath328 , depending on the observer @xcite . in both cases",
    "all the correlators of @xmath2 are independent of the data on the time - slice that the wave functional collapsed on except those localized right at the position of the detector @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "if rob never performs any further measurement on @xmath2 before entering the future lightcone of the joint measurement event done by alice , certainly he will have no idea that @xmath2 is in the uncollapsed or collapsed state .",
    "but right before the moment @xmath416 when rob is entering the future lightcone of the joint measurement event , these different reduced states of @xmath2 in different frames must have become the same collapsed one , with the same combination of the mode functions depending only on the data on the initial time - slice .",
    "so quantum teleportation after rob receives the classical information from alice will give a definite result consistent in all frames .",
    "suppose rob performs a measurement on @xmath2 before entering the future lightcone of the joint measurement event to see which state @xmath2 is in . in some observers frames @xmath2 s reduced state at the moment of rob s measurement is in the collapsed state , then the outcome will have some dependence on the outcome of @xmath1 since @xmath1 and @xmath2 were entangled initially .",
    "in other observers frames , @xmath2 is still in the uncollapsed state before the measurement , then this measurement will result in a wave functional collapse of the combined system , later in these frames the outcome of alice s joint measurement will have the same correlation with the outcome of @xmath2 . both kinds of histories interpreted by different observers will be consistent _ a posteriori _ , but both could not help rob to conclude @xmath2 was in the uncollapsed or collapsed state right before the measurement because the quantum state is only sampled by rob in one single measurement .",
    "if rob and alice share an ensemble of many copies of the entangled pairs , in some observers frames rob performs the measurement first , then using the outcomes rob can recognize the reduced state of @xmath2 as uncollapsed by quantum state tomography . in other observers frames , rob performs the measurement after alice . for these observers the exact collapsed state of one copy of the entangled pair may be different from another after the measurements by alice and not predictable ( either by rob or by alice ) , while the distribution of the collapsed state is determined by the uncollapsed state right before alice s measurement .",
    "so the reduced state of detector @xmath2 recognized by rob from his measurement on this ensemble of the collapsed states will have no difference from the uncollapsed one .",
    "rob still can not determine whether the reduced state of the _ single _ detector @xmath2 before his measurement is collapsed or not .",
    "if the joint measurement on @xmath1 and @xmath0 is performed after alice went beyond the event horizon @xmath412 of rob , the mutual influences ( @xmath417 and @xmath418 in @xmath419 ) will never reach rob , though it appears that some information of measurement could enter the collapsed reduced state of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "similar to the previous case with rob still outside the future lightcone of the joint measurement , the functional form of the correlators in the reduced state of @xmath2 will be suddenly changed at the moment of the projective measurement , and different observers will recognize different spacetime points where this change occurs . but again rob will never know whether the state of @xmath2 is in the uncollapsed or collapsed state .",
    "these reduced states in different frames will not be identical until @xmath12 goes to infinity or some moment rob performs a measurement on @xmath2 .",
