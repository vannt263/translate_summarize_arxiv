    "in recent years , strong observational evidence that the universe is currently expanding with acceleration has been obtained . in the einstein theory of gravitation , this positive acceleration is explained by the dominance of dark energy with a negative pressure in the universe [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "several theoretical models of dark energy have been suggested : the vacuum energy ( the cosmological constant @xmath2 ) or such dynamical components as quintessence [ 5 - 10 ] and k - essence [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "models with dynamical dark energy seem more realistic , since tracker [ 14 , 15 ] , or attractor , solutions are realized in them .",
    "thus , the problem of fine tuning the parameters of the universe is solved [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "a peculiar property of cosmological models with dark energy is the possibility of a big rip [ 16 , 17 ] : an infinite increase in the scale factor of the universe in a finite time .",
    "the big rip scenario is realized in the case of dark energy , the so - called phantom energy ( for which @xmath3 ) . in the big rip scenario",
    ", the cosmological phantom energy density tends to infinity , and all of the bound objects are torn apart up to subnuclear scales .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the condition @xmath3 alone is not enough for the big rip scenario to be realized [ 18 ] .",
    "alam et al . [ 19 ] analyzed data on distant supernovas in a model - independent way and showed that the presence of phantom energy with @xmath4 in the universe at present is highly likely .",
    "the quantum properties of the phantom energy in curved spacetime were considered in [ 20 ] .",
    "the entropy of the universe filled with phantom energy was discussed in [ 21 ] .",
    "models with phantom energy are also used to construct mole burrows [ 22 , 23 ] .",
    "the accretion of a scalar field onto a black hole from special poten - tials @xmath5 was considered in [ 24 - 29 ] .",
    "we use a different approach to describe the accretion of dark energy onto a black hole ; more specifically , we model the dark energy by an ideal fluid with a negative pressure .    in our recent paper [ 30 ] ( see also [ 31 ] ) , we showed that the masses of all black holes in the universe with phantom energy gradually decrease , and the black holes disappear completely by the big rip . in this paper , we consider in detail the stationary spherical accretion of dynamical dark energy onto a black hole .",
    "the dark energy is modeled by an ideal fluid with a negative pressure .",
    "the history of research on the accre - tion of an ideal fluid onto a compact object begins with bondi s classic paper [ 32 ] .",
    "a relativistic generalization was made by michel [ 33 ] ( see also [ 34 - 41 ] for further generalizations and supplements to michel s solution ) . carr and hawking [ 42 ] considered the accretion of dust and radiation onto a black hole by solving the complete system of einstein equations and taking into account the back reaction of the surrounding matter ( see also [ 43 ] for a description of the progress made in this area and for a discussion of fundamental questions ) .",
    "below , we obtain a solution for the stationary accretion of a test relativistic ideal fluid with an arbitrary equation of state @xmath6 onto a schwarzschild black hole . using this solu - tion",
    ", we show that the black hole mass decreases during the accretion of phantom energy .",
    "the masses of black holes can decrease during accretion in the case of phan - tom energy due to the violation of the energy domi - nance condition ( @xmath7 ) that underlies the theorem on the nondecreasing area of the event horizon of a classical black hole [ 44 ] .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we derive general equations for the spherical accretion of an ideal fluid and describe basic parameters of the steady energy flux onto a black hole .",
    "we consider an arbitrary equation of state , @xmath8 , where the pressure @xmath9 can be positive ( for ordinary matter ) and negative ( for dark energy , including phantom energy @xmath10 ) .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath11 of the equation of state need not be constant in our approach .",
    "accretion causes the black hole mass to change : the mass increases for @xmath12 and decreases for @xmath3 .",
    "the energy flux turns out to be completely determined by the black hole mass @xmath13 , the dark energy density at infinity @xmath14 , and the equation of state @xmath0 only if @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", there is a critical point that fixes the flux just as for an ordi - nary fluid .",
    "when the condition @xmath15 is violated , the dark energy flux onto a black hole can formally be arbitrary .",
    "for @xmath15 , we describe the method of calculating the fluid parameters at the critical point and the energy flux onto a black hole for given @xmath13 , @xmath16 , and @xmath0 . in section  3",
    ", we consider specific models of the equation of state for dark energy . in the first model",
    ", we use a simple equation of state with a linear density dependence of the pressure .",
    "we consider the special cases of accretion of several types of ideal fluid : ther - mal radiation , matter with an ultrahard equation of state , dark energy with @xmath17 , and linear phantom energy .",
    "the accretion rate of dark energy onto a moving black hole was calculated for the special case of @xmath18 .",
    "as the second model , we investigate the accretion of a chaplygin gas onto a black hole .",
    "the evolution of the black hole mass in the universe with the big rip is considered in section  4 .",
    "the possibility that the presence of phantom energy will lead the universe to the big rip in the future has been discussed in recent years .",
    "the problem of the fate of black holes in this universe is solved in a rather unexpected way : black holes are not torn apart , but disappear by the big rip due to the accretion of phantom energy , irrespective of their initial masses . in section  5 , we discuss the cor - respondence between the accretion of dark energy modeled by an ideal fluid onto a black hole and the accretion of a scalar field .",
    "the results obtained are briefly discussed in section  6 .",
    "let us consider the stationary , spherically symmetric accretion of an ideal fluid that models the dark energy in the special case of a negative pressure onto a black hole .",
    "the dark energy density is assumed to be low enough for the metric to be a schwarzschild one with a high accuracy : @xmath19 where @xmath13 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath20 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the angular spherical coordinates .",
