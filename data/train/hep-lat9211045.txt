    "this contribution represents the talk `` latest results from the ukqcd collaboration '' presented at lattice 92 .",
    "as the masses of hadrons in lattice gauge simulations approach the inverse lattice spacing , @xmath6 , quantities are expected to become increasingly sensitive to discretisation errors .",
    "thus it is in this regime , corresponding in present simulations to quarks with masses of the charm and above , that we expect differences between an @xmath0-improved fermion action and the standard wilson fermion action to be most apparent .    in this talk",
    "i shall describe the recent studies by the ukqcd collaboration of mesons containing propagating charm quarks .",
    "the talk begins with a brief description of the computational details .",
    "then a comparison is made of the hyperfine splitting in charmonium between the standard wilson action , and the @xmath0-improved clover action  @xcite .",
    "for the clover action , this investigation is extended to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 systems .",
    "finally , measurements are made of the pseudoscalar decay constant , @xmath9 , for heavy - light systems . by determining the behaviour of @xmath10 as a function of the pseudoscalar mass , @xmath11 ,",
    "an estimate is made of the magnitude of the non - scaling terms in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) in the region of the @xmath8-meson mass .",
    "clover quark propagators were generated on quenched @xmath1 lattices at @xmath2 , using three values of the quark mass up to the region of the strange quark mass , with hopping parameters @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "in addition , propagators were generated at four values of the quark mass in the region of the charm quark mass , with hopping parameters @xmath13 ; the charm quark mass corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "the preliminary results presented in this write - up are based on an analysis of 33 configurations , the results in the talk being based on an analysis of 21 configurations .",
    "the light quark propagators were generated using local sources and sinks ( ll ) .",
    "the charm quark propagators were computed from smeared sources , to both local sinks ( ls ) and smeared sinks ( ss ) , using a jacobi - smearing algorithm  @xcite with a smearing radius @xmath15 .",
    "the comparison of the hyperfine splitting in charmonium between the wilson and clover fermion actions was obtained on a common sample of 18 configurations , using local sources and sinks  @xcite .",
    "all fits to the correlators are performed taking into account the correlations between different time slices , with the error bars obtained using a bootstrap procedure .",
    "quenched calculations with the standard wilson fermion action typically find values of vector - pseudoscalar mass splittings , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are much too small , indeed typically by a factor of 2 and 4 respectively at @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the clover fermion action is related to the standard wilson fermion action through the addition of a term , @xmath19 the hyperfine splitting is expected to be sensitive to the magnetic moment form of this additional term .    ",
    "crrr & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 + wilson & 1.066 & 1.076 & 0.0104 + clover & 1.071 & 1.088 & 0.0190 +    to compare the values for the hyperfine splitting in charmonium , we chose @xmath23 for the wilson action , and @xmath24 for the clover action , yielding approximately the same value of the pseudoscalar mass , @xmath25 , for the two actions .",

    "gives @xmath26 gev  @xcite , and we find the values of the masses quoted in the table to be within a few percent of their physical values .",

    "the improvement in the measured value of the hyperfine splitting both for heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons using an @xmath0-improved action is very encouraging , and the remaining discrepancies with experiment may be due to the effects of quenching .",
    "the preliminary results for @xmath71 and @xmath3 presented here need further refinement , in particular to take account of the uncertainties in the lattice spacing .",

    "it is particularly important to measure the static results , with light quarks computed using the clover action , on the same set of configurations . a consistent extrapolation between the propagating quark results presented here and the static predictions would provide powerful evidence for the reliability of lattice studies of heavy quarks .",
