    "chui@xmath2 , v. n. ryzhov@xmath3 and e. e. tareyeva@xmath3      the seminal paper by n.n .",
    "bogoliubov `` to the theory of superffluidity '' , published in 1947 , had a great influence on the development of the modern theory of quantum many - body systems .",
    "it is cited in all textbooks devoted to this topic . however , for a long time the real experimental systems which could be quantitatively described by the model of dilute bose gas developed in this article were absent .",
    "only about 50 years later , the bose - einstein condensation was achieved in the dilute ultracold gas of magnetically trapped alkali atoms . since the first realization of bose - einstein condensation in ultracold atomic gas clouds @xcite",
    ", studies in this direction have yielded unprecedented insight into the quantum statistical properties of matter . besides the studies using the bosonic atoms , growing interest is focused on the cooling of fermionic atoms to a temperature regime where quantum effects dominate the properties of the gas @xcite .",
    "this interest is mainly motivated by the quest for the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) transition in ultarcold atomic fermi gasses @xcite .",
    "strong _ s_-wave interactions that facilitate evaporative cooling of bosons are absent among spin - polarized fermions due to the exclusion pauli principle .",
    "so the fermions are cooled to degeneracy through the mediation of fermions in another spin state @xcite or via a buffer gas of bosons @xcite ( sympathetic cooling ) .",
    "the bose gas , which can be cooled evaporatively , is used as a coolant , the fermionic system being in thermal equilibrium with the cold bose gas through boson - fermion interaction in the region of overlapping of the systems .",
    "however , the physical properties of bose - fermi mixtures are interesting in their own rights and are the subject of intensive investigations including the analysis of ground state properties , stability , effective fermi - fermi interaction mediated by the bosons , and new quantum phases in an optical lattices . several successful attempts to trap and cool mixtures of bosons and fermions",
    "were reported .",
    "quantum degeneracy was first reached with mixtures of bosonic @xmath4li and fermionic @xmath5li atoms .",
    "later , experiments to cool mixtures of @xmath6na and @xmath5li , as well as @xmath0rb and @xmath1k @xcite , to ultralow temperatures succeeded .    in this article",
    "we study the instability and collapses of the trapped boson - fermion mixture due to the boson - fermion attractive interaction , using the effective hamiltonian for the bose system @xcite .",
    "we analyze quantitatively properties of the @xmath0rb and @xmath1k mixture with an attractive interaction between bosons and fermions recently studied by modugno and co - workers @xcite .",
    "they found that as the number of bosons is increased there is an instability value @xmath7 at which a discontinues leakage of of the bosons and fermions occurs , and collapse of boson and fermion clouds is observed . using the experimental parameters we estimated the instability boson number @xmath7 for the collapse transition as a function of the fermion number and temperature and found a good agreement with experimental results .",
    "first of all we briefly discuss the effective boson hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the functional - integral representation of the grand - canonical partition function of the bose - fermi mixture .",
    "it has the form @xcite : @xmath8d[\\phi]d[\\psi^*]d[\\psi]\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\left ( s_b(\\phi^*,\\phi)+\\right.\\right.\\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\left.\\left.s_f(\\psi^*,\\psi)+s_{int}(\\phi^*,\\phi,\\psi^*,\\psi)\\right)\\right\\}. \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and consists of an integration over a complex field @xmath9 , which is periodic on the imaginary - time interval @xmath10 $ ] , and over the grassmann field @xmath11 , which is antiperiodic on this interval .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 describes the bose component of the mixture , whereas @xmath11 corresponds to the fermi component .",
    "the term describing the bose gas has the form : @xmath12 because the pauli principle forbids @xmath13-wave scattering between fermionic atoms in the same hyperfine state , the fermi - gas term can be written in the form : @xmath14 the term describing the interaction between the two components of the fermi - bose mixture is : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the masses of bosonic and fermionic atoms respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath13 wave scattering lengths of boson - boson and boson - fermion interactions .",
    "integral over fermi fields is gassian , we can calculate this integral and obtain the partition function of the fermi system as a functional of bose field @xmath23 . in the semiclassical thomas - fermi approximation one",
    "has @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "so we can write the effective bosonic hamiltonian in the form : @xmath28 the first three terms in ( [ 21 ] ) have the conventional gross - pitaevskii form , and the last term is a result of boson - fermion interaction . in low temperature limit @xmath29 one can write @xmath30 in the form : @xmath31      let us consider now the @xmath0rb and @xmath1k mixture with an attractive interaction between bosons and fermions @xcite",
    ". the parameters of the system are the following : @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "k and rb atoms were prepared in the doubly polarized states @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the magnetic potential had an elongated symmetry , with harmonic oscillation frequencies for rb atoms @xmath39 and @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 .",
    "the collapse was found for the following critical numbers of bosons and fermions : @xmath42 .      in principle",
    ", one can study the properties of a bose - fermi mixture with the help of @xmath47 ( [ 25 ] ) without any expansion .",
    "however , the form of the hamiltonian ( [ he ] ) gives the possibility to get a clear insight into the physics of the influence of the fermi system on the bose one ( see discussion below ) .",
    "it may be easily verified that the expansion of the function @xmath48 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) ) up to the third order in @xmath49 gives a reasonably good approximation for @xmath50 even for rather large values of @xmath49 , in contrast with the higher order expansions , so one can safely use eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) as a starting point for the investigation of the properties of the bose subsystem .    in derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ he]-[p2 ] ) we also use the fact that due to the pauli principle ( quantum pressure ) the radius of the bose condensate is much less than the radius of the fermi cloud @xmath51 , so one can use an expansions in powers of @xmath52 .    from eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) one can see that the interaction with fermi gas leads to modification of the trapping potential . for",
    "the attractive fermion - boson interaction the system should behave as if it was confined in a magnetic trapping potential with larger frequencies than the actual ones , in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "boson - fermion interaction also induces the additional attraction between bose atoms which does not depend on the sign of @xmath43 .",
    "the last term in @xmath53 ( [ he ] ) corresponds to the three - particle _ elastic _ collisions induced by the boson - fermion interaction .",
    "in contrast with _ inelastic _",
    "3-body collisions which result in the recombination and removing particles from the system @xcite , this term for @xmath54 leads to increase of the gas density in the center of the trap in order to lower the total energy . the positive zero point energy and boson - boson repulsion energy ( the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) ) stabilize the system .",
    "however , if the central density grows too much , the kinetic energy and boson - boson repulsion are no longer able to prevent the collapse of the gas .",
    "likewise the case of bose condensate with attraction ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the collapse is expected to occur when the number of particles in the condensate exceeds the critical value @xmath7 .",
    "the critical number @xmath7 can be calculated using the well - known ansatz for the bosonic wave function : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a dimensionless variational parameter which fixes the width of the condensate and @xmath57 .    in this case",
    "the variational energy @xmath58 has the form : @xmath59 @xmath60 this energy is plotted in fig.1 as a function of @xmath56 for several values of @xmath61 .",
    "it is seen that when @xmath62 there is a local minimum of @xmath58 which correspond to a metastable state of the system .",
    "this minimum arises due the competition between the positive first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ var ] ) and negative fourth term .",
    "the local minimum disappears when the number of bosons @xmath61 exceeds the critical value which can be calculated by requiring that the first and second derivatives of @xmath58 vanish at the critical point . in this case",
    "the behavior of @xmath58 is mainly determined by the second and fourth terms in eq .",
    "( [ var ] ) . for @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "we obtain @xmath65 in a good agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the critical number of bose atoms in bose - fermi mixture is about two orders larger than the critical number for the condensate with a purely attractive interaction .",
    "for example , in the experiments with trapped @xmath4li @xcite it was found that the critical number of bosons is about @xmath66 .      upon increasing the number of fermions , the repulsion between bosons decreases leading to the collapse for the smaller numbers of the bosonic atoms .",
    "it should be also noted that an increase of the temperature results in a decrease of the local density of fermions and reduces the interaction energy between bose and fermi systems increasing the critical number of bosons .",
    "finally , we make a short remark on the nature of the collapse transition . in this article",
    "we found the instability point of the bose - fermi mixture with attractive interaction between components .",
    "a strong rise of density of bosons and fermions ( in the collapsing condensate enhances intrinsic inelastic processes , in particular , the recombination in 3-body interatomic collisions , as is the case for the well - known @xmath4li condensates @xcite .",
    "however , recently m. yu .",
    "kagan and coworkers suggested the new microscopic mechanism of removing atoms from the system which is specific for the bose - fermi mixtures with attraction between components and is based on the formation of the boson - fermion bound states @xcite .",
    "it seems that the description of the evolution of the collapsing condensate should include both these mechanisms .",
