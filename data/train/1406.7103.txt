    "the description of complex interactions with surrounding can be significantly simplified by a use of the noise , which provides effective approximation to not fully known processes .",

    "white type of the noise underlines that stochastic pulses acting on a test particle are independent .",
    "the gaussianity is the consequence of the central limit theorem , which states that a distribution of a sum of many independent and bounded summands converges to the normal ( gaussian ) distribution .",

    "analogously like the white gaussian noise plays special role in the theory of stochastic systems also the lvy type noise becomes more important as it is capable to describe out - of - equilibrium phenomena .",
