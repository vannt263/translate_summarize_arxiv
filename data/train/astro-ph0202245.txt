    "important emphasis in research on active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in recent years has been in the area of unified models ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "these models try to explain the observed differences between broad ( seyfert 1s - like ) and narrow ( seyfert 2s - like ) optical emission - line agns by invoking obscuration ( from an optically and geometrically thick torus ) and viewing angle effects rather than intrinsic physical differences .",
    "a privileged energy band for such studies is the hard ( e@xmath4 2 kev ) x - ray band , where continuum photons are less affected by absorption and where imprinted features ( e.g. the photoelectric absorption cut - off , the fluorescent fek line ) allow to probe the physics of the agns nuclear regions , and their surroundings .    while there is increasing consensus on the validity of these models , at least for those that unify nearby `` classical '' seyferts , questions remain on the `` typical '' seyfert galaxy x - ray spectrum .",
    "this is particularly true for lower - luminosity objects and for the detailed relationship between their x - ray versus optical appearance and classification . in particular ,",
    "several open questions remain , such as whether the x - ray spectra of all nearby seyferts are consistent with unified models and whether the x - ray spectra of low - luminosity seyferts are consistent with that of higher luminosity ones . also , precise knowledge of the distribution of column densities and the geometry of the putative molecular torus , of the origin of fek emission lines , and of the shape of the x - ray luminosity function of local seyfert galaxies once extended to its fainter end , is still lacking .",
    "answers to the above questions are also crucial to put tighter constraints on synthesis models of the xrb and to understand the evolution of `` seyfert - like '' agns with cosmic time ( e.g. comastri et al .",
    "1995 , gilli et al .",
    "these models usually assume the validity of unified models and suggest that a combination of unabsorbed ( seyfert 1-type ) and absorbed ( seyfert 2-type ) agns may account for most of the x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "but in fact , major uncertainties remain in the assumed @xmath5 distributions , luminosity functions of both types of objects and their evolution with cosmic time .    the definition of the spectral properties of a complete and , _ bona fide _",
    ", unbiased sample of nearby seyfert galaxies is , thus , desired to address both the issues of unified models of agns and synthesis models of the xrb .",
    "hard x - ray samples of nearby seyfert galaxies available to date ( e.g. from _ ginga _ , _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ ; smith & done 1996 , turner et al .",
    "1998 , bassani et al .",
    "199 ) have been essentially biased towards the most x - ray luminous , and less absorbed agns . moreover , the poor spatial resolution of the pre-_chandra _ and pre-_xmm - newton _",
    "telescopes left unresolved issues such as a proper estimate of stellar / starburst processes and/or x - ray binaries contributions to the total x - ray emission of low - luminosity ( l@xmath6 @xmath1 10@xmath7erg / s ) seyfert galaxies .",
    "significant improvements have been obtained by ho et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using the acis ccds on board _ chandra _ , who can address for the first time the x - ray properties of llagns ( with 2 - 10 kev luminosities ranging from less than 10@xmath8 to 10@xmath9 erg / s ) in nearby seyferts , liners and liners / hii transition nuclei .",
    "these authors detected a compact , pointlike nuclear source in @xmath1062% of their initial sample of 24 ( out of 41 ) nearby galaxies .",
    "however , the brief `` snapshots '' exposures used in the chandra survey will make it difficult to obtain detailed spectral information at energies greater than 2 kev .",
    "given the above arguments , we have initiated an _",
    "xmm - newton _ x - ray survey of all known northern seyfert galaxies with d@xmath222 mpc using the revised - ames catalog of bright galaxies ( sandage & tamman 1981 ) spectroscopically classified by ho , filippenko & sargent ( 1997 ) according the classical definition of seyfert galaxies ( veilleux & osterbrock , 1987 ) .",
    "the final sample contains 28 galaxies ( see table 1 ) and is the deepest and most complete local sample of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the goal of this survey is to obtain a better , and unbiased , understanding of their `` typical '' x - ray spectrum .",
    "this high - throughput ( especially for energies @xmath42 kev ) _ xmm - newton _ survey is complementary to the arcsecond - resolution _ chandra _ survey performed by l. ho , e.d .",
    "feigelson , and collaborators .",
    "our team has been awarded @xmath10 250 ks of epic guarantee time , and exposures of 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 ks ( with a typical value of 10 ks ) were requested in order to obtain at least @xmath10 1000 source counts - l@xmath11 correlation of serlemitsos et al .",

    ", observations have been performed for about half of the galaxies , and data are available for 6 of them . here",
