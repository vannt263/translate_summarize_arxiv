    "this formula is easily generalized to functions @xmath4 that are absolutely continuous with derivative of bounded variation , which is equivalent to say that @xmath4 is the difference of two convex functions .",

    "this is not a problem when we restrict ourselves to the path - independent case : @xmath134 .",
