    "the advent of the unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with its torus of dusty material , helped make sense of many of the observed properties of the numerous classes of active galaxy , but has brought with it its own set of challenges .",
    "an intense modeling effort has been under way with the aim of understanding and predicting the emission from dusty tori and explaining the observational data @xcite , and with some success in matching the gross infrared properties of agn , but several observations have proven particularly difficult to reproduce . especially problematic have been the width of the ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , the similarity of the observed seds given the wide range of variation in x - ray column densities , and , most notoriously , the behavior of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature . while the feature is commonly seen in absorption in type 2 objects @xcite ,",
    "the corresponding emission feature expected for type 1 objects has to date only been detected in a handful of objects , mostly qsos @xcite .",
    "torus models must therefore be capable of producing a silicate feature in type 2 agn while suppressing it in most type 1 objects .",
    "recently , progress has been made towards overcoming some of these problems .",
    "for instance , using a model in which the dust is contained in discrete clouds , thought to be necessary to ensure dust survival in the harsh agn environment , @xcite were able to construct seds broad enough to match typical observed seds . in these models ,",
    "the silicate absorption feature was visible in an edge - on view of the torus but the emission could be greatly weakened in a face - on view . by biasing the grain size distribution to large sizes , @xcite were able to suppress the silicate emission feature , although their models tend to predict larger torus inner radii ( @xmath510 pc ) than recent observational limits ( see below ) . @xcite were also able to suppress the silicate emission and fit the mean type 1 sed by introducing different sublimation radii for large and small grains . given advances such as these , torus models will benefit from high - quality observations against which they can be thoroughly tested .",
    "recent high spatial resolution observations of several active galaxies at 10 and 20 @xmath0 m , where a torus re - emits a substantial fraction of the radiation incident upon it , indicate that the tori may be very small .",
    "for example , the outer diameter of the mid - ir emitting dust associated with the torus has been shown to be no greater than a few parsecs in ngc  1068 and the circinus galaxy @xcite , and @xmath635 pc in ngc  4151 @xcite , although cooler dust at larger distances is not ruled out . at the same time",
    ", some agn are also associated with extended mid - ir emission from dust on scales of a few hundred parsecs or larger @xcite . on moving from large to small apertures , the ir spectrum of an active galaxy will often change from being dominated by pah emission bands to showing a featureless continuum or silicate absorption feature @xcite . where the agn component can be spectrally isolated from large - aperture data , the expected clear dichotomy in hard x - ray / mid - ir flux ratios between types 1 and 2 agn is not observed , perhaps because dust heated by the nuclear source but not associated with the torus itself is contributing to the mid - ir flux @xcite .",
    "it is therefore clear that observations at the highest possible spatial resolution will be necessary to disentangle the torus and extended emission and provide a fair test for models of the dusty torus .    as one of the nearest , brightest and best - studied agn , the archetypal seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc  1068 ( 14.4 mpc distant for @xmath7 ; 1  = 72 pc ) , is an excellent candidate for mid - ir observations at high spatial resolution .",
    "the existence of a hidden broad line region in ngc  1068 , as revealed by the broad emission lines detected in polarized light @xcite , along with evidence for high extinction along our line of sight , strongly suggests the presence of obscuring dust in a toroidal geometry .",
    "further evidence for a torus comes from the strong nuclear mid - ir source coupled with emission from ionized gas extended in a roughly conical structure oriented approximately northeast - southwest ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "modeling of 10  @xmath0 m interferometric observations of the nucleus suggests a hot , compact ( @xmath61 pc ) structure , surrounded by a more extended ( approx .",
    "2@xmath13 pc ) warm component , interpreted as dust in the hot inner wall of the torus @xcite .",
    "larger - scale 10 and 20 @xmath0 m emission from ngc  1068 is observed to extend out from the central source to the northeast and southwest @xcite ; further out , low surface brightness mid - ir emission is detected from a ring of star formation located at kiloparsec distances from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature is seen in absorption in ngc  1068 @xcite .",
    "previous narrow - band imaging suggests that the depth of the absorption varies over the nuclear region @xcite , but the spatial coverage and spectral resolution of those studies has been insufficient to allow detailed conclusions about the distribution and profile of the feature to be drawn .",
    "we have therefore performed spatially resolved n band spectroscopy of the nucleus and ionization cones of ngc  1068 with michelle , the mid - ir imager and spectrometer on the 8.1 m gemini north telescope .",
    "the spatial resolution of the spectra , approximately 0.4 , allows us to separate the nuclear and extended emission regions and reveals the distribution of the silicate feature across the nuclear region .",
    "having largely isolated the spectrum of the torus in the spectrum of the central 0.4@xmath10.4  ( @xmath2 30@xmath130 pc ) of ngc  1068 , we compare it with the clumpy torus model of @xcite .",
    "the data set also allows us to examine the detailed spatial distribution of fine structure emission lines in the 10  @xmath0 m region , which have been reported previously only in very large aperture iso measurements @xcite or in few - arcsecond aperture ground - based spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "in  [ obs ] we describe the observations and reduction of the data , while  [ results ] presents the results obtained for the acquisition images , nuclear spectra and model comparison , extended silicate feature and emission lines .",
    "we also report the results of a sensitive search at 5  @xmath0 m for co lines towards the nucleus of ngc  1068 , which serves as a probe of the nature and distribution of molecular gas near the center of this galaxy .",
    "the implications of this work are discussed in ",
    "[ discuss ] and summarized in  [ conc ] .",
    "n - band acquisition images and spectra of the nucleus of ngc  1068 were obtained during commissioning of michelle @xcite on gemini north .",
    "observations were performed on ut 2004 august 10 ( epoch 1 ) and repeated on 2005 january 31 ( epoch 2 ) . in each case",
    "the 2-pixel ( 0.4 ) wide slit , oriented at 20east of north , was used together with the lown grating , resulting in a dispersion of 0.024  @xmath0m / pixel and r@xmath8200 .",
    "observations were made using a standard chop - nod technique to remove time - variable sky background , telescope thermal emission and to reduce the effect of 1/f noise from the array / electronics .",
    "the chop throw was 15@xmath9 , fixed at 20@xmath10 east of north , and the target was nodded the same amount along the slit .",
    "extended emission has been detected at @xmath815  from the nucleus , but its surface brightness ( usually @xmath1110 mjy / arcsec@xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is negligible compared to that of the region from which spectra were extracted . as fast tip / tilt guiding is possible in only the on - source beam",
    ", the data used were on - source only and the quoted exposure times are for the on - source data .    in both epochs we obtained acquisition images with on - source",
    "integration times of 4 seconds through the si-5 11.6@xmath0 m filter ( @xmath13@xmath14 = 1.1@xmath0 m , 50@xmath15 cut - on / off ) . in spectroscopic mode , on - source integration times were 1043 s for the first epoch and 680 s for the second .",
    "the plate scale of michelle is 0.099/pixel in imaging mode and 0.198/pixel in spectroscopic mode .",
    "the weather was good for both epochs and the fwhm of the standard star was measured to be 0.35  on the first and 0.43  on the second .",
    "the diffraction limit ( 1.22@xmath14/d ) of the telescope at the cut - on of the si-5 filter is 0.34 .",
    "the orientation of the slit on the galaxy , and the area from which spectra were extracted , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slitpos ] .",
    "the figure illustrates that the slit was aligned to the peak brightness of ngc  1068 to better than 0.1  on the second epoch and to around 0.2  on the first , with the difference attributable to slight pointing errors during instrument commissioning . to investigate the possibility that the object drifted out of the spectroscopic slit during the observation , due to effects such as guiding errors or differential refraction between the optical guide camera and the mid - ir science beam , we split the observation into several sections and measured the peak emission in each .",
    "the counts changed by @xmath66% and @xmath610% on the first and second nights respectively , typical of mir photometric variations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that any drifts in guiding were less than 0.1 .",
    "michelle data files contain planes consisting of the difference for each chopped pair for each nod - set . using the gemini iraf package ,",
    "these difference images were combined until a single frame was created . during this process",
    "the chopped pairs were examined to identify any obviously compromised by anomalously high background , electronic noise , or other problems ; it was not judged necessary to exclude any frames from the final images .",
    "finally , the resultant image was divided by a spectroscopic flat field .",
    "the spectra were extracted in 0.4  sections ( 2 pixels along the slit in spectroscopic mode , corresponding well to the average seeing disc over the two epochs ) , covering the central few arcseconds of ngc  1068 , stepping outwards from an aperture centered on the flux peak .",
    "michelle spectra show a slight ( @xmath3 1 pixel ) curvature across the array , which was measured using the standard star data and the resulting apertures used in extracting the ngc  1068 spectra .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated to an accuracy of 0.02  @xmath0 m using the telluric absorption lines present in the peak ngc  1068 spectrum , and then divided by the standard star ( bs 1101 , f9v ) and multiplied by a 6000 k blackbody curve .",
    "cancellation of the deep telluric o@xmath16 band in the spectra extracted at distances @xmath54 pixels ( 0.8 ) from the nucleus was poor , so a spectrum of the o@xmath16 feature ( derived from the standard star spectra set to zero outside the band ) was added back into the star spectra in varying amounts and these `` composite '' star spectra used to divide out the telluric band in those ngc  1068 spectra .",
    "the scaling of the o@xmath16 band in the star spectra was determined by comparing the depth of the resulting , ratioed ngc  1068 spectra at 9.7  @xmath0 m with that of a spline fit to the ratioed ngc  1068 spectra , with the 9.3 - 10.0  @xmath0 m region excluded from the fit .",
    "flux calibration was achieved through comparison with bs  1101 , whose n band magnitude was taken to be 2.9 .",
    "the resulting spectral flux densities are expected to be accurate to about @xmath1720% .",
    "the calibration agreed to within 40% between the two epochs , with the second epoch s data being higher in flux and thus closer to other small - aperture measurements in the literature @xcite .",
    "the difference in flux between the two epochs is probably mainly due to the small difference in the positioning of the slit .",
    "fine structure line emission by the [ ar  iii]+[m  vii ] blend at 8.99  @xmath0 m , [ s iv ] at 10.51  @xmath0 m , and [ ne ii ] at 12.81  @xmath0 m ( rest wavelengths ) was readily apparent out to several arcseconds from the nucleus .",
    "line fluxes were computed from the averages of 4 - 6 data points centered on each of the line wavelengths and five continuum points on either side of each line . the uncertainty in the derived line fluxes is expected to be small except",
    "very near the center , where line - to - continuum ratios are very low and systematic errors dominate ( particularly in deriving the [ ne  ii ] flux at the edge of the n band window ) . apart from these lines , no other narrow spectral features are apparent in the reduced spectra .",
    "slit losses were estimated from the profile of the star along the slit ( which was assumed to be circularly symmetric ) to be @xmath850% on both nights .",
    "the spatial distributions of all three fine structure lines appear to be fairly smooth , with no major contributions from pointlike sources , so to correct for systematic overestimates in fluxes resulting from slit losses in the standard star spectrum used for flux calibration , measured line fluxes at all slit positions were multiplied by a factor of 0.5 . at positions @xmath186 pixels from the peak , the continuum flux also approaches a smooth spatial distribution , whereas at the nucleus it appears dominated by a pointlike source ( although somewhat smoothed by small tracking errors , differential refraction etc . during the long integration ) .",
    "no correction for slit losses has been applied to the continuum flux density , but the effect of any correction would be to increase the degree to which it is concentrated on the nucleus .",
    "a high resolution m - band spectrum of ngc  1068 was obtained at ukirt on ut 1998 december 29 .",
    "the spectrum was acquired with the facility instrument , cgs4 @xcite , using its 31  l / mm echelle .",
    "the slit width was 0.9  and the velocity resolution was 20 km / s ( r=15,000 ) .",
    "the total exposure time was 18.7 minutes .",
    "the spectrum of ngc  1068 was ratioed by the spectrum of hr 804 ( a3v ) , which was observed both before and after ngc  1068 in order to provide a precise airmass match .",
    "the pressure - broadened pf beta line in hr 804 produces a broad emission bump in the ratioed spectrum , centered at 4.654  @xmath0 m ; this was removed by dividing by a heavily smoothed ( gaussian fwhm = 300 km / s ) version of the ratioed spectrum .",
    "the 11.6  @xmath0 m acquisition images ( fig . [ fig : slitpos ] ) , taken to assist in positioning the nucleus in the slit , reveal features similar to those detected in previous high spatial resolution mid - ir imaging of ngc  1068 . as shown by @xcite , ngc  1068 is initially extended in a roughly north - south direction centered on the nucleus .",
    "the northerly extension is at a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath8 14within @xmath8 0.5 , turning easterly to a pa of @xmath820around 1  from the nucleus .",
    "the southern extension is at a pa of 190at 0.5from the nucleus , bending westerly further from the nucleus .",

    "the approximate centers of the northeastern and south - southwestern knots are located close to a line running radially through the nucleus .",
    "the mid - ir extensions are enclosed within the near - ir polarization structures observed both north and south of the nucleus by @xcite , who interpreted the structure as scattering from electrons within the ionization cones .",

    "this implies a deconvolved extent of @xmath80.3  along the cones and @xmath60.2  perpendicular .",
    "that is similar to the size derived by @xcite from deconvolution of subaru images .",
    "table  [ table1 ] lists the flux density @xmath20 measured in various apertures @xmath21 together with the corresponding beam - averaged surface brightness @xmath22 . at the 14.4 mpc distance",
    "to ngc 1068 , the observations cover dust emission within radial distances from @xmath8 15 pc to @xmath18 300 pc around the nucleus .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the findings of @xcite , whose reported flux density for a 0.4  aperture is 12 jy , with a scatter between 11 jy and 13.5 jy .",
    "together , the observations reveal the presence of two distinct emission components : low - brightness emission from dust in the ionization cones extending to hundreds of pc , and bright emission from a central compact source , identified as the agn obscuring torus by @xcite .",
    "the torus is resolved by the interferometric observations , which show that its mid - ir size is @xmath8 3pc ( 0.04 ) , much smaller than our angular resolution .",
    "therefore in our observations the torus is effectively a point source within the central 0.4  diameter region .",
    "however , because the brightness of this region is much higher than that of the surrounding area , its spectrum is dominated by the torus flux .",
    "indeed , the mean color temperature estimated from our flux densities at 8  @xmath0 m and 13  @xmath0 m in the central spectrum (  [ mirspec ] ) is @xmath8330  k , in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the flux collected by the larger apertures is dominated by the ionization cones lower surface brightness diffuse emission .",
    "for example , in 1.2  and 4  diameter apertures centered on the nucleus , the core contributes less than 30%  and 20% , respectively , of the total flux .",
    "the extended dust emission from the ionization cones was previously noted by @xcite and @xcite , and our observations clarify the relative importance of the flux from the torus and the cones . like previous high spatial resolution mid - ir imaging studies ,",
    "our images show no evidence for mid - ir emission extending several tenths of an arcsecond east and west of the nucleus , as reported by @xcite at l and m.      spectra of the nucleus and ionization cones of ngc  1068 , extracted in 0.4  steps ( as described in  [ obs ] ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] for both epochs .",
    "all of the spectra consist of a strong dust continuum upon which a broad silicate absorption feature and narrow fine structure lines are present . at each slit position",
    "the shapes of the two spectra are similar , showing broadly similar changes in spectral slope and silicate depth with distance from the nucleus .",
    "the relative weakness of the epoch 1 spectrum on the nucleus results from the slit on that date being slightly offset from the peak of the emission which , unlike the emission from the ionization cones , is unresolved in the east - west direction .",
    "[ fig : specs ] highlights the good agreement of the profiles of the two central spectra .",
    "the depth of the silicate absorption feature is an important parameter in modeling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of agn and hence has been studied in detail for ngc  1068 and several other agn @xcite .",
    "however , most previous mir observations of agn have lacked the spatial and/or spectral resolution to probe the nucleus with minimal contamination from the surrounding mir - emitting regions .",
    "the observations presented here accomplish this and also provide the opportunity to spectroscopically study the extended silicate feature along the ionization cones of ngc  1068 , as well as the emission lines within the cones .",
    "we quantify the depth of the observed silicate feature using @xmath23 .",
    "this quantity would be the 9.7  @xmath0 m optical depth of an absorbing screen in front of a background source when the screen emission is negligible .",
    "in realistic configurations the relation of @xmath23 to actual optical thickness is more complex , but it is still a meaningful phenomenological indicator . to estimate the 9.7  @xmath0 m continuum we interpolated between the median of the spectrum near 8.2 and 12.4  @xmath0 m , wavelengths chosen to be outside the silicate feature as far as possible without including regions of poor telluric cancellation or the 12.8  @xmath0 m [ ne  ii ] emission line .",
    "the procedure is equivalent to fitting a linear continuum to the spectra ; the limited wavelength extent of the n - band atmospheric window , only slightly wider than the silicate feature itself , makes determination of the true underlying continuum shape difficult , but we believe that this simple approach is at least indicative .",
    "1@xmath19 uncertainties were estimated from the scatter of the data points around 8.2 , 9.7 and 12.4  @xmath0 m used in the calculation of @xmath23 .",
    "it has been pointed out by many authors that pah emission features on the short and long wavelength sides of the silicate absorption feature ( 8.6 and 11.3  @xmath0 m ) can serve to exaggerate the depth of the feature , particularly when the spectral resolution is very low and/or spatial resolution is limited .",
    "the larger - aperture spectra of @xcite and @xcite show no evidence of the pah features , but by themselves can not rule out contributions by pahs in regions as small as the gemini / michelle slit segments . in the high spatial resolution",
    "r@xmath8200 michelle spectra presented here , however , there is no indication , in any of the spectra , of the pah features , in particular of the 11.3  @xmath0 m band , which would be easily recognized at this resolving power .",
    "the absence of pah emission simplifies estimates of @xmath23 .",
    "however , the peak of the silicate band unfortunately coincides with the broad atmospheric o@xmath16 absorption band centered at 9.6  @xmath0 m , which limits the accuracy of @xmath23 , particularly in spectra far from the nucleus .    in the following sections , we discuss in detail the continuum slope , the silicate absorption at the nucleus , the more extended silicate feature , and the emission lines .",

    "this offset is to the north - northeast , and is the direction expected based on the trends in extinction as a function of position ( see  [ nlr ] ) . in addition , all three line fluxes peak 0.4  nne of the center .",
    "correcting the measured line fluxes for extinction at each position along the slit based on @xmath23 would result in more symmetric distributions about the nucleus for all three lines .",
    "however , variations in extinction can not entirely explain the spatial distributions of the relative fluxes of the three lines .",
    "for example , close to the center the large asymmetry in the [ ne  ii ] line flux at 0.4  nne compared to 0.4  ssw will be much less extinction - corrected than the asymmetries of the other lines , whose wavelengths are closer to the peak of the silicate absorption .",
    "thus other effects such as variable excitation or an asymmetric distribution of material must also contribute to the offset between the continuum and emission line peaks .",

    "second , the uv / optical polarisation mechanism in the central @xmath751  of ngc  1068 is thought to be electron scattering @xcite , mainly on the basis of the wavelength - independent polarization spectrum , but the high efficiency for dust relative to electron scattering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "arranging the dust in optically thick clumps associated with the nlr clouds , in accordance with the good spatial coincidence of the structures emitting in [ o iii ] and at 12.8  @xmath0 m @xcite , may circumvent these problems .",
    "gray scattering from such clumps may be able to mimic the wavelength - independent polarization caused by electron scattering @xcite , and the dust would be likely to survive for much longer in this kind of configuration @xcite .",
    "arranging the dust in clumps could also explain the low reddening of the ionization cones while permitting appreciable silicate absorption , as much of the ionized gas would be expected to lie outside the clumps , which would only have a small covering factor . in this scenario ,",
    "any emission component in the silicate feature in the cones would result from a view of the hot sides and faces of clumps towards the far edge of the cone .",
    "the absorption would then arise in the cooler surfaces of clumps closer to the near edge of the cone , inclined away from the central engine , and in a small amount of foreground dust .",
    "the presence of dust clumps was suggested by @xcite to explain seds showing silicate emission in the southern ionization cone ( stated to be tilted away from the line of sight and therefore exposing hot clump surfaces to our view ) , at odds with the present data and @xcite .",
    "however , the southern cone is also thought to be located behind the disk of the galaxy and subject to increased extinction that may well suppress a silicate emission feature from hot clump faces .",
    "further from the nucleus , on the other hand  around and including the `` northeast knot '' first identified by @xcite  both dust and electron scattering are thought to contribute to the polarization @xcite , suggesting the presence of dust other than in clumps .      in fitting both the nuclear 10  @xmath0 m spectrum and the broader ir sed ,",
    "the clumpy torus models require most of the mid - ir - emitting dust in the torus to exist rather close to the nucleus . in the models with @xmath36 , for example ,",
    "90% of the clouds lie within 3 pc of the agn .",
    "this is comparable to the dimensions of the warm dust structure detected by @xcite in ngc  1068 , and also in agreement with recent imaging data constraining the central ir source to a diameter of a few parsecs or less in several other seyfert galaxies @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "both mid - ir imaging and the torus model predictions imply that substantial additional mid - ir emission arises outside the central source .",
    "this is also apparent in the comparison of observational data in different apertures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mod2 ] : there is a clear trend for subarcsecond - aperture measurements at wavelengths as short as 3  @xmath0 m to be appreciably lower than larger - aperture ones , even when stellar dilution is taken into account in the 3 - 5  @xmath0 m data , as in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note the wavelength dependence of trends among different apertures . in the near - ir ,",
    "the 1.5  measurements of @xcite are in good agreement with the high - resolution results of @xcite at both h and k bands .",
    "the compact emission is known to dominate at these wavelengths , contributing about 80% of the flux in a @xmath89 aperture at k @xcite . in the l and m bands",
    ", however , the @xcite flux density measurements exceed the compact source by a large factor , and this difference persists in the @xcite 2-aperture n band measurements . while estimates of the torus emission are known to be unreliable in the far - ir because of the large beams involved , even ground - based mid - ir observations do not usually isolate the agn contribution .",
    "this is also relevant to the interpretation of the non - detection of co lines in the m band spectrum : the m - band imaging of @xcite , for example , implies that the aperture used for the co observations contains emission from much material not directly associated with the torus .",
    "we therefore first examine the limiting case in which all of the gas exists in optically thick clouds much smaller than the beam size  such as the torus clouds modeled in  [ nucsil ] and the nlr clouds proposed in  [ sil ]  and then go on to consider the constraints the co non - detection places on the nature and distribution of material both outside and inside those clumps .",
    "if the only molecular material is in optically thick molecular clouds , the upper limit on the co lines can be interpreted as constraining the filling factor , @xmath90 , of these clouds .",
    "the dark sides of individual clouds will be strong co absorbers , so we assume that the absorption from such clouds removes all the light from the beam at that position .",
    "the limit on co line absorption then implies that the beam filling factor of molecular clouds must be less than 0.03 , comparable to the @xmath910.1 quoted by @xcite as a reasonable realization of the clumpy torus model . on the other hand ,",
    "if the entire 5  @xmath0 m continuum source including the torus clouds is obscured in part by cool foreground material , the implications of the non - detection of co will depend on the nature of that material .",
    "as discussed earlier , in dense molecular clouds essentially all of the c is in co , and the limit on the co column density in implies much less than a magnitude of visual foreground extinction . in diffuse clouds",
    "typically only 1%  of the c is in co , so that the limit can tolerate as much as 5 - 10 mags of visual foreground extinction .    as noted in ",
    "[ nlr ] , in realistic clumpy dust configurations , however , the relation between @xmath23 and optical depth is not straightforward . therefore fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] may not be appropriate for estimating the extinction to the 5  @xmath0 m continuum emitting regions .",
    "the @xmath88 of the region covered by the 0.9  m band slit has been derived from he ii line ratios by @xcite , who find a mean value of 0.22 to the nne and values typically @xmath770.3 to the ssw . using the standard value of @xmath92",

    "this is several times greater than the extinction implied by the co non - detection assuming the foreground material to be molecular in nature , but consistent with the presence of diffuse clouds .",

    "mid - ir emission in apertures larger than @xmath8 1  is dominated by a second component , the lower brightness , diffuse emission from the agn - heated dust in the ionization cones .",
    "if ngc 1068 is representative of other sources , the implication is that agn seds are highly uncertain since the torus does not dominate large - aperture photometry at wavelengths longer than the near ir .",

    "<S> we present spatially - resolved , near - diffraction - limited 10  @xmath0 m spectra of the nucleus of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  1068 , obtained with michelle , the mid - ir imager and spectrometer on the 8.1 m gemini north telescope . </S>",

    "<S> the spectra extracted in 0.4  steps along the slit reveal striking variations in continuum slope , silicate feature profile and depth , and fine structure line fluxes on subarcsecond scales , illustrating in unprecedented detail the complexity of the circumnuclear regions of this galaxy at mid - ir wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of photometry in various apertures reveals two distinct components : a compact ( radius @xmath3 15 pc ) , bright source within the central 0.4  @xmath1 0.4  and extended , lower brightness emission . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the compact source with the agn obscuring torus , and the diffuse component with the agn - heated dust in the ionization cones . while the torus emission dominates the flux observed in the near - ir , the mid - ir flux measured with apertures larger than about 1  </S>",
    "<S> is dominated instead by the dust emission from the ionization cones ; in spite of its higher brightness , the torus contributes less than 30% of the 11.6  flux contained in the central 1.2  region . </S>",
    "<S> many previous attempts to determine the torus spectral energy distribution are thus likely to be significantly affected by contamination from the extended emission . </S>",
    "<S> the observed spectrum of the compact source is compared with clumpy torus models , the first detailed comparison of such models with observational data . </S>",
    "<S> the models require most of the mid - ir emitting clouds to be located within a few parsecs of the central engine , in good agreement with recent mid - ir interferometric observations . </S>",
