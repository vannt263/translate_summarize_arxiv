    "<S> solid solution between nonmagnetic narrow gap semiconductor fesi and diamagnetic semi - metal cosi gives rise to interesting metallic alloys with long - range helical magnetic ordering , for a wide range of intermediate concentration . </S>",
    "<S> we report various interesting magnetic properties of these alloys , including low temperature re - entrant spin - glass like behaviour and a novel inverted magnetic hysteresis loop . </S>",
    "<S> role of dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction in the magnetic response of these non - centrosymmetric alloys is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the narrow - gap semiconductor fesi has drawn attention of condensed matter physicists repeatedly since late nineteen thirties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the revival of strong interest @xcite in fesi during last decade is mainly due to its similarities with those of narrow gap rare - earth intermetallics popularly known as `` kondo insulators '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison gives rise to the possibility of the study of complex many - body phenomena associated with kondo - lattice systems . </S>",
    "<S> doping with al in fesi leads to a heavy fermion metal through a metal - insulator transition with strong similarities with that for si : p ( ref.4 ) with the exception of a strongly renormalized effective carrier mass . </S>",
    "<S> the fe@xmath0co@xmath1si alloys are also remarkable in that they are magnetic for almost all the intermediate concentration regime @xcite , while the end compounds fesi and cosi are nonmagnetic , the latter being a diamagnetic semi - metal@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recent discovery of unusual positive magnetoresistance@xcite in these supposedly helimagnetic fe@xmath0co@xmath1si alloys@xcite alongwith the suggestion of the interplay of quantum coherence effect at relatively high temperature are quite exciting . </S>",
    "<S> the unusual square - root field - temperature dependence of electrical conductivity and the positive nature of the magnetoresistance are correlated to square - root singularity in the density of states probably associated with `` enhanced electron - electron interactions '' in a disordered ferromagnet with low carrier concentration@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest a possible new microscopic mechanism of magnetoresistance that could lead to the development of new type of magnetic materials of technological importance@xcite . in the light of these unusual findings , we became motivated for a closer scrutiny of the magnetic properties of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si alloys , especially in the low field and low temperature regime . </S>",
    "<S> there exist already some hints of unusual low field magnetic properties of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si alloys in the form of an almost singular behaviour in magnetization and cusp - like minimum in magnetoresistance near h = 0 ( ref . </S>",
    "<S> 7 ) . in this communication </S>",
    "<S> we report results of high resolution magnetization measurements in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si alloys highlighting ( i ) low temperature low field re - entrant spin - glass like behaviour ( ii ) interesting thermomagnetic history effects including a novel `` inverted hysteresis loop '' with negative remanence . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of this latter effect ( which was so far considered to be limited to thin - film type of magnetic materials @xcite ) in relatively simple alloys like the present ( fe , co)si , is definitely interesting . </S>",
    "<S> we shall argue that the occurrence of dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction in the present non - centrosymmetric cubic b20 fe@xmath0co@xmath1si alloys@xcite is playing an important role for the observed magnetic properties .    </S>",
    "<S> the polycrystalline samples of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si ; x = 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.35 , 0.45 and 0.65 were prepared by argon arc melting from high purity starting materials . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were annealed for 90 hours in vacuum at 900@xmath2c for improving the homogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> magnetiztion measurements were performed using a commercial squid - magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms-5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a scan - length of 4 cm with 32 data points in each scan was used for the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however , all the important results were checked by varying the scan - length from 2 to 8 cm , to rule out any possible role of the small field inhomogeneity of the superconducting magnet ( which is actually scan - length dependent ) in the observed magnetic properties . also before the start of each experimental cycle </S>",
    "<S> the sample chamber is heated to 200 k and flushed with helium ; this is to get rid of any oxygen leaking into the sample chamber over a period of time .    in fig.1(a ) </S>",
    "<S> we plot magnetization ( m ) and inverse dc - susceptibility ( @xmath3 ) versus temperature ( t ) for fe@xmath0co@xmath1si with x = 0.15 and 0.35 . </S>",
    "<S> estimated curie temperatures ( t@xmath4 ) agree well with those reported in the literature @xcite . in fig.1(b)-(c ) we plot m vs field ( h ) plots for these alloys at various t both below and above t@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> data also exist for x = 0.1 and 0.45 but not shown here for the sake of clarity and conciseness . </S>",
    "<S> the almost singular behaviour in m(h ) near h = 0 for t @xmath5 t@xmath4 as reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 7 is quite evident in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b)-(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we shall now concentrate in the low h magnetic response of these alloys . in fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> we present m vs t plots for x = 0.35 alloy obtained both in the zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) mode in various applied h. we observe two distinct features for h @xmath6 500 oe , namely ( 1 ) a peak in m@xmath7(t ) and a sharp change in slope in m@xmath8(t ) at a temperature t@xmath9 ( @xmath5 t@xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) a distinct thermomagnetic irreversibility ( tmi ) i.e. m@xmath10 m@xmath8 for t@xmath6 t@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> same qualitative features have also been observed for x = 0.1,0.15 and 0.45 . </S>",
    "<S> both these features , which disappear with h @xmath11 500oe , have not been reported so far ( to our knowledge ) for these ( fe , co)si alloys .    the low - t low - h magnetic response described above has appreciable resemblance with the re - entrant spin - glasses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to investigate more in this regard we have studied the h dependence of magnetization in details in two different t - regimes : ( 1 ) t @xmath5 t@xmath9 , and ( 2 ) t@xmath12 t @xmath5 t@xmath4 . in fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> we plot m vs h for x = 0.35 alloy at 4.5k highlighting the following striking features :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> there is a distinct bulge in the virgin m - h curve obtained after zero - field cooling the sample from t @xmath11 t@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature takes the virgin m - h curve in a limited h - regime outside the field descending ( ascending ) m - h curve obtained after field cycling to 50 koe ( -50 koe ) . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   in the field cycling process </S>",
    "<S> if the maximum field of excursion h@xmath13 goes beyond the technical saturation point h@xmath14 1 koe at t = 4.5k ) , the m - h curve takes the shape of an inverted hysteresis loop , i.e. , the descending field leg of the m - h curve lies below that of the ascending field leg with positive coercivity and negative remanence ( see the lower inset of fig.3)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> if h@xmath13 is limited to h @xmath15 h @xmath16 , m remains perfectly reversible . </S>",
    "<S> however , as h@xmath13 enters the h - regime where the virgin m - h curve starts showing the non - linear behaviour in the form of a bulge , a small but distinct positive hysteresis is observed ( see the upper inset of fig.3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this hysteresis disappears as h approaches h = 0 in the descending field cycle and m merges with the virgin m - h curve . with h@xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath16 this positive hysteresis changes sign giving rise to an `` inverted hysteresis loop '' in the low field regime ( h @xmath5 h@xmath16 ) while the m - h curve remains perfectly reversible ( within our experimental resolution ) in the high field regime ( h @xmath11 h@xmath16 ) .    in the t - regime t@xmath18 t @xmath5 t@xmath4 the bulge in the virgin m - h curve and the associated positive hysteresis </S>",
    "<S> are not observed . </S>",
    "<S> however , inverted hysteresis loop behaviour continues to exist at h @xmath5 h@xmath16 ) even for t @xmath11 t@xmath9 . and </S>",
    "<S> as before , the m - h curves remain reversible for h @xmath11 h@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> all these features of the m - h curve are also observed in x = 0.1 , 0.15 and 0.45 alloys in the same qualitative manner .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed peak in m@xmath7(t ) and tmi in m - t plots in fig.2 with h @xmath6 500 oe can naively be interpreted in terms of the hindrance of domains motion in a ferromagnetic system@xcite . however , even if the various anomalous aspects of the m - h curves decsribed above are ignored , the estimated coercivity field @xmath19h@xmath20 of the order of 15 oe in our x = 0.35 alloy at t = 4.5k rules out such a simple explanation in our measurements with applied h of 500 oe which is much larger than @xmath19h@xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the distinct change in slope in m@xmath8(t ) can not be associated with any domain - related phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that there exist probably a re - entarnt spin - glass like magnetic phase@xcite for t @xmath5 t@xmath9 in these alloys . </S>",
    "<S> this low t phase appears to be quite fragile and can easily be erased with moderate applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note here that the anomalous bulge in the virgin m - h curve is observed below t@xmath9 only , and it is quite clear from the above arguments that it is not associated with any domain related phenomenon either . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this non - linear beahviour in the virgin m - h curve probably represents a field - induced transition from a low - h magnetic state to a high - h one . </S>",
    "<S> the bulge in the virgin m - h curve has been reported earlier for ( fe , co)si in passing @xcite , and in the absence of a detailed magetization study it was attributed to domain related effects in a ferromagnet @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar anomalous behaviour of the virgin m - h curve in cefe@xmath21-based pseudobinary alloys has been associated recently with the first order nature of a field induced metamagnetic transition @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the question now arises how to rationalise the interesting magnetic properties of ( fe , co)si within the framework already developed for these alloys . </S>",
    "<S> small angle neutron scattering measurements @xcite have suggested the magnetic ordering in ( fe , co)si alloys to be of long period helimagnetic in nature . </S>",
    "<S> a model to explain such long period helimagnetic order can be based on a competition between a dzyaloshinski - moriya ( dm ) interaction and a heisenberg type exchange interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - centrosymmetric cubic b20 structure of ( fe , co)si alloys supports the existence of dm interaction . </S>",
    "<S> can this competition between these two types of interactions in ( fe , co)si alloys give rise to a re - entrant spin - glass like behaviour ? </S>",
    "<S> dm interaction apparently plays an important role in metallic spin - glasses and re - entrant spin - glasses @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of a re - entrant spin - glass like phase in ( fe , co)si alloys is not entirely unexpected , especially with the presence of inherent disorder in the ( fe , co ) sublattice . in fact </S>",
    "<S> hints of repartition of the magnetic moments in the helix due to alloying effects exist in early neutron studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> satellites due to both clockwise and counterclockwise helixes were observed in neutron measurements in zero field cooled samples . </S>",
    "<S> after excursion to a high h , the single clockwise helix was stabilized to the field direction with no satellites observed in any other direction @xcite . on reduction of h </S>",
    "<S> to zero the helix does not come back to a specific eqilibrium direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the case of isostructural ordered compound mnsi where also the helix follows the field but comes back to @xmath22 direction in low h ( ref.6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was argued that the disorder in ( fe , co ) sublattice caused a local fluctuations of the co - efficient of d - m interaction to produce two kinds of domains consisting of either a clockwise or counterclockwise helix in the zero field cooled state . </S>",
    "<S> the local fluctuation of magnetization might play a role of pinning effect of the magnetic impurity preventing the propagation vector from pointing to the equilibrium direction @xcite .    the observed `` inverted hysteresis loop '' , however , does not find a simple explanation within the above framework . </S>",
    "<S> such `` inverted hysteresis loops '' have been observed in recent years in specific exchange - coupled multilayers such as co / pt / gd / pt and epitaxial fe films on w(001 ) ( ref . </S>",
    "<S> 10 and 11 ) . in such materials </S>",
    "<S> their thin film structure apparently play an important role and hence it is considered that `` inverted hysteresis loop '' is probably a phenomenon limited to thin - film type of magnetic materials . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a very recent report of `` inverted hysteresis loop '' in a bulk magnetic material comprising of cyanide - bridged multi metal complexes @xcite . the observed `` inverted hysteresis loop '' in this bulk material </S>",
    "<S> is explained `` by the competition between the sublattice magnetization rotation due to the spin - flip transition and the trapping effect due to the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while there exists signature as discussed above of spin - flip transition in the present ( fe , co)si alloys and also the suggestion that d - m interaction can cause trapping effect for domains especially if spins are canted within the domains @xcite , it is a bit premature to import the similar picture here . </S>",
    "<S> more experimental information , especially the microscopic ones like neutron scattering , is required to form even a qualitative model to expain the `` inverted hysteresis loop '' in the present system .    </S>",
    "<S> we note in figs.1 ( b)-(c ) that while the technical saturation point is reached in the m - h curves below t@xmath4 for x = 0.15 and 0.35 alloys at fairly low fields ( h@xmath231 koe ) , m actually continues to increase beyond h@xmath16 even up to the highest field of our measurement i.e. 50 koe . </S>",
    "<S> this two stage magnetization process indicates that after the initial low - h alignment , the local spins , which are probably canted , line up slowly with further increase in h beyond h@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we can actually make a reasonable fit of the m - h curve in the regime h@xmath24 h @xmath5 50 koe to a h@xmath25 behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> similar behaviour has also been observed for x = 0.1 and 0.45 alloys . </S>",
    "<S> manyala et al @xcite have earlier reported that magnetoresistance in some of these alloys also varied as h@xmath25 in the h regime beyond technical saturation . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates that the behaviour of these alloys is quite different from a conventional ferromagnet even in the high - h regime .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our present dc - magnetization measurements in conjunction with the results of earlier neutron studies @xcite , suggest that there exists a low - t low - h magnetic state in ( fe , co)si alloys which resembles a lot of the re - entrant spin glasses . with the incease in t and h </S>",
    "<S> , it transforms to a presently recognized high - h high - t helical fm state . </S>",
    "<S> careful neutron measurements in various ( h , t ) regimes with different thermomagnetic history will be useful to settle this issue . </S>",
    "<S> the high - t high - h magnetic state of these alloys has an unusual magnetic field dependence in the form of m @xmath26 h@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> also , the magnetization response is reversible above the field for technical saturation h@xmath16 , and produces a narrow `` inverted hysteresis loop '' below h@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> a proper understanding of these magnetic responses and their possible correlation to the technologically promising magnetotransport@xcite will help in the search for newer magnetic materials tunable for practical use . </S>"
