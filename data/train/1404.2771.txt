    "interestingly , this coincides with the build - up of a strong magnetic field in the disk ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig : beta ] and [ fig : vert_time_vt ] ) , indicating that the additional magnetic pressure support provided by the strong field alters the disk rotation rate .",

    "in fact , vertical and radial mass fluxes differ by less than a factor of two for model vert - trap .",
    "interestingly , this suggests that the launching of a wind in a dynamically evolving turbulent disk could be instigated by a slowing of the radial accretion flow .",
    "the evolution of mean magnetic fields proceeds differently for model vert - trap compared to vert ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : bav ] and [ fig : bav_vert_vbc ] ) . as previously mentioned , the mean toroidal field grows considerably up until @xmath129 for vert - trap , at which point a sudden sharp field reversal occurs with a corresponding spike in @xmath54 . inspecting the correlation between vertical field ( @xmath101 ) and turbulent stresses ( @xmath54 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphap_btheta ] , one sees that during the initial transient phase of the simulation ( @xmath130 ) similar behaviour to model vert is observed .",
    "however , at late times ( @xmath114 ) , a much stronger correlation between @xmath131 and @xmath54 is apparent .    in summary , trapping of field in a turbulent disk leads to a highly magnetized state exhibiting large , highly variable accretion stresses .",
    "in contrast , model tor-@xmath42 shows that an initially equipartition strength field will disperse if outflow is unconstrained . in this regard the results of model vert - trap and tor-@xmath42 are complementary to the study of efficiently accreting ( @xmath132 ) , strongly magnetized ( @xmath133 ) disks by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "models vert - trap and tor-@xmath42 suggest that a strongly magnetized state can only arise , and be maintained , when radial flow is constrained .",
    "this point is discussed further in   [ subsec : environment ] .",
    "c +    c +      a general trend from the models in ",
    "[ subsec : field_topology ] is that during the initial transient phase of disk evolution the field configuration is disrupted and not entirely conserved .",
    "for example , the initially purely vertical magnetic field in model vert leaves the domain in the accretion flow and its subsequent evolution becomes similar to other models initialised with different field topologies ( e.g. tor-@xmath43 and loop ) . in this section",
    "we use model vert - b+ to examine the disk evolution that occurs when a weak vertical magnetic field is steadily added to the simulation domain , replenishing the field that is advected away at early times .",
    "the motivation for model vert - b+ comes from the possibility that in astrophysical disks additional magnetic field ( i.e. beyond that contained in the simulation initial conditions in this case ) may flow into the disk from larger radii or , alternatively , a field component on scales much larger than the simulation domain may pervade the disk .",
    "the setup for model vert - b+ is identical to that of model vert , with the exception that a constant @xmath134 is added to the simulation domain between @xmath135 and for all @xmath18 and @xmath136 .",
    "the @xmath18-component of the magnetic field is added at a constant rate such that it would generate a @xmath137 strength field in a time interval of @xmath138 .",
    "note that the injected @xmath134 is divergence - free and is added to the staggered mesh component of @xmath134 .",
    "the effect of injecting a weak vertical magnetic field on the turbulent stresses is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_tests ] .",
    "up until a simulation time of @xmath139 the @xmath140 values for models vert - b+ and vert are quite similar . however , from @xmath141 onwards",
    "the models diverge and the turbulent stress in model vert - b+ rises sharply . by @xmath142 the stress reaches",
    "@xmath143 - we were unable to evolve model vert - b+ beyond this point as the highly turbulent state of the disk proved problematic for the simulation code .",
    "as such , vert - b+ does not reach a quasi - steady state making an analysis of time - averaged quantities / profiles difficult . from the short duration of vert - b+",
    "it is unclear whether additional vertical mass - loss in the form of a wind is triggered by the burst in activity at @xmath144 .    during the simulation the disk rotation deviates from keplerian rotation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vphi_rad_vert - b+ ] ) .",
    "patches of sub - keplerian rotation are observed between @xmath145 at times later than @xmath146 .",
    "however , at @xmath147 regions of sub - keplerian rotation also begin to extend to smaller radii , coincident with the onset of the accretion burst . recalling the results of model vert - trap where sub - keplerian rotation was coincident with strong magnetic fields in the disk ,",
    "a possible explanation for the emergence of patches of sub - keplerian rotation in model vert - b+ is that strong vertical field is dragged through the disk by the accretion flow .",
    "this causes a back - reaction , with further field growth leading to an increase in magnetic field , as in the classic picture of field amplification via the mri @xcite .",
    "the contrast in model evolution between vert - b+ and vert in the time interval @xmath148 does , however , highlight important differences resulting from vertical field replenishment .",
    "firstly , it is worthwhile to note that the rate of injection of @xmath134 into the domain is not abrupt , yet the accumulation of additional field is sufficient to bring about a burst in accretion . during this burst phase the strength of the radial , vertical , and toroidal magnetic field components",
    "are all seen to grow , illustrated by a decrease the respective plasma-@xmath41 values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] ) .",
    "in essence , only a relatively weak vertical magnetic field need be injected into the disk to cause a considerable change in the accretion activity of the disk .",
    "local shearing - box models by @xcite display similar behaviour whereby the injection of a vertical magnetic field into an already turbulent disk causes considerable changes to the turbulent state .",
    "model vert - b+ extends this picture to global disks , albeit with a simple prescription for magnetic field injection .",
    "a detailed study of the parameter space relating to field injection ( e.g. , rate of field injection , topology of injection field , radius of field injection ) would require additional models that are beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "the cause of the transient outburst clearly must be related to the injection of vertical magnetic field . however , on inspection , the exact details are subtle .",
    "firstly , if allowed to accumulate , the injected magnetic field would equate to a @xmath137 vertical field in a time span of @xmath138 . at",
    "@xmath149 one finds from eq  ( [ eqn : lambdamri ] ) that @xmath150 , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the cell size and number of cells per scale - height in the @xmath153-direction , respectively . for @xmath154",
    "one finds @xmath155 , indicating adequate resolution of the fastest growing mri mode for the initial field in models vert , vert - trap , and vert - b+ .",
    "however , the transient arises after @xmath156 in model vert - b+ , after which time the accumulated field would have @xmath157 , which is borderline in terms of adequate resolution for the mri to develop .",
    "the next clue comes from examining the mean field evolution and plasma-@xmath41 for model vert - b+ . the mean vertical field in model vert - b+ levels - off at @xmath158 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bav_vert_b+ ] ) , in contrast to the continuing decline seen for vert ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bav ] ) .",
    "then , at @xmath159 , @xmath160 grows , which directly coincides with the burst in accretion activity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_tests ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the vertical field , measured by the vertical field plasma-@xmath41 , also grows at this time ( illustrated by a decrease in @xmath161 in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] ) .",
    "therefore , although the accumulated field is relatively weak in terms of adequate resolution it counters the loss of field in the accretion flow to the extent that the disk evolution is altered .",
    "this may arise from the injected field building - up in dormant areas of the disk ( e.g. at larger radii where the mri takes longer to set - in initially ) which , upon becoming actively turbulent , triggers a burst in accretion .",
    "c +      the simulated disks in models tor-@xmath42 , tor-@xmath43 , vert , and loop evolve to a similar quasi - steady turbulent state with no indication of a large amplitude recurrent burst of accretion will be subject to recurring accretion bursts , related to an artificial build - up of low azimuthal wavenumber energy triggering a secondary phase of linear non - axisymmetric mri growth .",
    "however , the simulations presented in this work use an azimuthal extent of @xmath162 with no sign of a recurrent linear - mri phase , suggesting that run times longer than we have considered may be required for sufficient energy to build up . ] .",
    "astrophysical disks , on the other hand , do exhibit recurring transient bursts .",
    "this variability is often attributed to thermal instability @xcite , whereby the build - up of matter during the quiescent state leads to a sudden increase in disk opacity related to the ionisation of hydrogen .",
    "subsequently , the disk heats up and the turbulent activity rises .",
    "the compatibility of this scenario with magnetorotational turbulence has recently been demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite . from a slightly different tack ,",
    "@xcite suggest that dwarf novae eruptions originate from a combination of magnetorotational turbulence with some secondary episodic ( global ) instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "common to the above suggestions for triggering a transient burst is the build - up of mass in the disk . in this section",
    "we examine the results of a supplementary simulation ( model tor - m+ ) which tests the response of a turbulent magnetic global disk to the rapid addition of zero angular momentum mass .",
    "this model uses the state of tor-@xmath43 at @xmath163 for its initial conditions .",
    "then , in the interval @xmath164 the mass source term ( described in   [ subsec : hydromodel ] ) is modified to : i ) relax the density towards twice that of the initial conditions , and , ii ) conserve angular momentum in density increments , @xmath165 , such that the azimuthal velocity , @xmath166 , is respectively modified by @xmath167 .",
    "we note that model tor - m+ is also applicable for understanding the subsequent disk evolution following stochastic accretion in the disk tearing scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "shortly after the enhanced mass injection commences the disk undergoes a transient burst of accretion activity and a sharp rise in @xmath6 for model tor - m+ at @xmath168 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_tests ] ) .",
    "@xmath54 subsequently decays , with a mild recurrence at @xmath169 , possibly related to clumps of mass compressing magnetic field as they advect through the disk .",
    "this premise is supported by @xmath170 falling to @xmath171 at this time ( compared to @xmath172 for model tor-@xmath43 ) - see fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] and table  [ tab : models ] . examining the vertical structure of the disk in model tor - m+ ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vert ] ) it bears close similarity to model tor .",
    "the most notable difference is in the strength of the magnetic field , which is clearly stronger in all components for model tor - m+ compared to tor , but more apparently so for the radial and vertical field .",
    "the mechanism that triggers the outburst is two - fold .",
    "firstly , increasing the density reduces the alfv ' en speed , which in turn reduces the wavelength of the fastest growing mri mode ( see eq  [ eqn : lambdamri ] ) .",
    "this opens up additional fast growing , short wavelength mri modes which can inject energy on the smallest scales . secondly , reducing the azimuthal velocity in regions where mass is added causes gravitational attraction to exceed the centrifugal force .",
    "hence , over - dense regions move radially inwards , dragging field lines with them which are then sheared .",
    "the result is a rise in radial field followed by conversion to toroidal field , both of which act to enhance the turbulent stresses .",
    "the stresses produced by magnetorotational turbulence effectively transport angular momentum .",
    "however questions have been raised about whether the level of angular momentum transport produced by mri - driven turbulence ( quantified by @xmath54 ) is actually sufficient to explain observations of astrophysical accretion disks .",
    "for example , @xcite compiled results from shearing - box studies and highlighted a disparency between simulated @xmath54 values of @xmath173 and observationally inferred values of @xmath174 for post - outburst dwarf novae disks .",
    "there are some important points to note about this discrepancy .",
    "firstly , unstratified shearing - box studies with a net vertical field display @xmath54 values as high as 0.2 - 0.7 @xcite",
    ". however , a typical consequence of a net vertical field is a disk wind , whereas a number of the objects discussed by @xcite show no evidence of a wind , jet , or large - scale vertical field of any description .",
    "the evolution of a global disk threaded with a net vertical field has been explored in this work - see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "interestingly , during the transient phase of model tor-@xmath42 , @xmath54 reaches values as high as @xmath175 , with no associated disk wind ( i.e. the vertical - to - radial mass flux ratio is small ) . at late - times in the simulation",
    "the net vertical field has been effectively removed , slipping away in the accretion flow , and irrespective of the initial field configuration one finds @xmath176 .",
    "a similar range of values for @xmath106 is seen in previous global disk simulations .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath177 during the late - time evolution , whereas the study by @xcite ( for which the models are not evolved beyond the initial transient phase ) reports @xmath106 as high as 0.15 .",
    "taking stock of the above results , there is an obvious suggestion that magnetorotational turbulence can produce sufficiently large @xmath106 values to gain agreement with observation .",
    "however , the disk must either be made to undergo a transient burst , or , a net vertical field must be retained / replenished over dynamically significant timescales .",
    "we have demonstrated the viability of these channels with models tor - m+ , vert - trap , and vert - b+ , which produce @xmath178 .",
    "an isolated disk will evolve to a common quasi - steady turbulent state , irrespective of the initial conditions and/or initial disturbance to the disk .",
    "this is illustrated by models tor-@xmath43 , tor-@xmath42 , vert , and loop , for which statistical measures of the turbulence are similar during the late - time disk evolution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* where the influence of different initial perturbations is examined ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , astrophysical disks do exhibit transient evolution and in some cases changes in the accretion state .",
    "model vert - trap shows that altering the rate that mass and magnetic field can leave the disk can cause abrupt changes to the accretion state .",
    "in essence , events occurring exterior to the disk can directly influence the accretion state by regulating the inflow / outflow of material / field .",
    "all of this points to the importance of the environment outside of the disk .",
    "one must then give consideration to the timescale(s ) associated with the external process(es ) .",
    "for example , if the disk expels magnetic flux in the accretion flow at a rate faster than it can be digested by the central object , be it a star or a black hole , then the build - up of magnetic flux may impinge on the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , accretion of magnetized gas onto the disk at a rate faster than it can be processed by the turbulence can lead to a strongly magnetized state @xcite .",
    "the environment surrounding the accretion disk may enforce preservation of field topology , or provide a source of poloidal magnetic flux into the disk over a dynamically important timescale .",
    "for example , the conservation of magnetic flux in collapse scenarios @xcite , accretion of magnetic field in a galactic nucleus @xcite , or wind accretion in a binary system @xcite .",
    "global models similar to those presented in this study could be readily augmented to examine these scenarios .",
    "launching a wind from a turbulent magnetized disk remains a challenging problem .",
    "recent studies adopting shearing - box models have demonstrated that vertical outflows arise from a patch of a turbulent disk if initialised with a net flux vertical field @xcite . however , the radially periodic shearing - box boundary conditions preserve the net vertical field topology ( see   [ sec : mean_field ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the vertical field in model vert exits the disk in the accretion flow ( see also * ? ? ? * ) and during the quasi - steady state the ratio of vertical - to - radial mass flux is @xmath179 .",
    "model vert - trap , on the other hand , shows that if the radial flow out of the disk is constrained ( so as to trap vertical and azimuthal field ) then the vertical - to - radial mass flux reaches @xmath180 .",
    "hence , the results indicate that time - steady disks do not launch winds if the radial flow is unconstrained , whereas wind - launching may be triggered if the rate at which vertical / azimuthal field exits the disk is impeded ( compared to the steady - state rate ) .",
    "the dependence of turbulent stresses on initial field configuration , magnetic field trapping due to inhibited radial outflow , magnetic field injection , and rapid mass injection has been investigated using global mhd disk simulations .",
    "properties of the saturation stress level during the early - time transient phase of disk evolution show a dependence on the initial magnetic field .",
    "this finding is consistent with models presented by @xcite which focused on the transient phase during roughly the first @xmath181 of the simulation .",
    "however , a major new result in this work , and one which was achieved by utilising a mass source term to avoid the exhaustion of disk mass by ongoing accretion , is that irrespective of the strength and topology of the initial magnetic field an _ isolated _ magnetorotationally turbulent disk evolves to a statistically similar quasi - steady state that is characterised by : i ) a volume - averaged stress - to - gas - pressure ratio , @xmath182 , ii ) a gas - to - magnetic pressure ratio , @xmath183 , and , iii ) zero - net time - averaged radial and azimuthal magnetic fields .",
    "simulations exploring the influence of trapping of magnetic field , vertical field injection , and of rapid mass injection , on the turbulence reveal that these mechanisms lead to relatively large stresses in the disk",
    ". trapping of magnetic field produces a strongly magnetized disk with @xmath10 and considerable vertical mass flux in the form of an intermittent wind .",
    "the injection of a vertical magnetic field , even a relatively weak one that equates to an accumulation of a @xmath137 field over a time interval of @xmath138 , is sufficient to trigger a burst in accretion with stresses reaching @xmath184 .",
    "rapid mass injection leads to a sudden sharp increase in turbulent stresses , peaking at @xmath132 and subsequently decaying to the pre - outburst level .",
    "the results of these simulations may be relevant for understanding accretion state changes , transient bursts , and large observationally inferred accretion efficiencies for astrophysical disks .",
    "indeed limit cycle behaviour reminiscent of dwarf novae eruptions could be produced with the inclusion of a temperature ( and perhaps also surface density ) dependent resistivity , following similar suggestions by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
