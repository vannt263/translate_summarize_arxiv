    "one - dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) has been studied for many years @xcite .",
    "it is one special type of aseps which represent one of the basic models studying non - equilibrium behavior of particle transport along one - dimensional lattices .",
    "asep was first introduced in @xcite for the explanation of ribosome inside the cell of creature .",
    "now , asep has also been used to simulate a lot of physical processes including surface diffusion @xcite , traffic model @xcite , and molecular motors @xcite,@xcite , etc .",
    "tasep , as a special case of asep , has two identical characters .",
    "one is that the model is discrete , which means that it is studied in finite time intervals .",
    "the other is that the particles in the lattices can only move in one direction .",
    "the analytical solutions under open boundary conditions had been obtained in @xcite .",
    "under open boundary conditions , the solutions yield phase diagrams with three phases @xcite . at small values of injection rates @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the system is found in a low - density entry - limited phase where @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the densities at the entrance , exit and the bulk of the lattice far away from the boundaries , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the flux .    at small values of extraction rates",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 , the system is in a high - density exit - limited phase with + @xmath8 at large values of the injection ( @xmath9 ) and extraction ( @xmath10 ) rates the system is in a maximal current phase with + @xmath11 a large number of varieties of extensions of taseps have been investigated , such as tasep with hierarchical long - range connections @xcite , two lane situations @xcite , two speed tasep@xcite , the effect of defect locations@xcite , particle - dependent hopping rates @xcite , and so forth .",
    "recently , j. brankov @xcite and e. pronina @xcite studied an asep with two chains in the middle of the filament .",
    "they supposed that a particle chooses to move into these two chains with equal probability , 0.5 and these two chains have the same length .",
    "then in 2007 , yao - ming yuan and rui jiang @xcite investigated a tasep with a shortcut in the middle .",
    "they set a possibility @xmath12 for a particle to jump through the shortcut when it faces the bifurcation , and they set the length of the shortcut to be zero .",
    "unfortunately , they did not state the situation clearly .    in this paper , we will investigate tasep with one or two shortcuts respectively .",
    "the length of the shortcut is also assumed to be zero .",
    "for example , the filament on which the motor moves may be twisted as figure 1(a ) , a motor may have a chance to jump directly from site @xmath13 to @xmath14 , as shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "to the basic model , i.e. there is only one shortcut along the filament .",
    "it is natural for us to divide the whole filament into three segments . as shown in figure 1(b ) , a molecular motor will face a choice of whether to jump through the shortcut or to move ordinarily through segment 2 , when it reaches site @xmath13 .",
    "an important problem is that the particle at site @xmath13 may have to wait to go through the shortcut if there is also another particle occupying site @xmath15 . which of them to go first should be determined clearly .",
    "after the basic model investigated , we would like to do some research work on our advanced model 1 .",
    "in advanced model 1 , there are two shortcuts which begin and end at different sites .",
    "these two shortcuts stay respectively along the filament , that is to say , shortcut 2 begins after shortcut 1 ends , as shown in figure 2 .    also , considering the difference of places where the shortcuts stay , we have advanced model 2 , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "in advanced model 2 there are also two shortcuts .",
    "but they begin at the same site and end at different , which means when a motor moves into site @xmath13 , it will choose whether to pass through shortcut 1 or shortcut 2 or to go ordinarily through segment 2 .    in the following ,",
    "we firstly give the detailed description of the different models , then we will discuss their phase situation of the corresponding segments theoretically , which is followed by the numerical simulations .",

    "first , we divide the lattices into three segments , as shown in figure 1(b ) .",

    "<S> in this paper , the operation of totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with one or two shortcuts under open boundary conditions is discussed . using both mathematical analysis and numerical simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we have found that , according to the method chosen by the particle at the bifurcation , the model can be separated into two different situations which lead to different results . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained in this paper would be very useful in the road building , especially at the bifurcation of the road . </S>"
