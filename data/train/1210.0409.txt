    "the electronic structure of a certain class of materials , commonly known as strongly correlated materials , is crucially determined by electron correlations . in these materials",
    "one - particle theory , predominantly the local density approximation ( lda ) within density functional theory@xcite , is often far from sufficient in providing an accurate and reliable description of the electronic structure .",
    "the reason for the failure of one - particle theory may be traced back to the presence of many configurations close in energy arising from a partially filled narrow band characteristic of these materials , similar to the situation in atoms with partially filled shell .",
    "it is not surprising that description of the electronic structure in terms of a single slater determinant is not satisfactory .",
    "one of the most fruitful approaches in treating the electronic structure of these materials is the green function technique with a nonlocal and energy - dependent self - energy . among the green function approaches ,",
    "the combination of the lda and the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite , i.e. , the lda+dmft method@xcite , is perhaps the most widely used technique in describing the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials .    in many calculations based on model hamiltonians",
    "it is often assumed that the self - energy is local , meaning that it has no momentum or @xmath7 dependence and the hubbard @xmath8 used in solving the impurity problem is assumed to be static .",
    "how these two approximations affect the resulting band structure remains to be investigated .",
    "experience with the electron gas teaches us that there is a strong cancellation between the effects of @xmath7-dependent self - energy and frequency - dependent self - energy .",
    "this is revealed by the fact that effective mass of the electron gas with density relevant for most materials is quite close to unity .",
    "the effective mass in general depends on two factors : the derivative of the self - energy with respect to frequency , which tends to enhance the effective mass , and the derivative of the self - energy with respect with the @xmath7-vector , which tends to have the opposite effect . in the electron gas",
    "these two factors tend to cancel each other , hence the effective mass being close to unity@xcite .",
    "we have no apriori reason to believe that such an almost complete cancellation remains true in real materials , especially in the strongly correlated systems .",
    "indeed , it is often claimed that for narrow - band materials the self - energy has little @xmath7-dependence so that a local but dynamic theory with frequency - dependent self - energy provides a good approximation to the full self - energy .",
    "the @xmath7-dependent self - energy becomes even more relevant with the recent progress in solving the impurity problem with a frequency - dependent hubbard @xmath8@xcite .",
    "this new algorithm makes it possible to perform lda+dmft calculations using a dynamic hubbard _ u _ , instead of a static one as in conventional calculations .",
    "this raises an important issue concerning the role of nonlocal or @xmath7-dependent self - energy .",
    "the use of dynamic _ u _ might lead to an overestimation of band narrowing or mass enhancement because the dynamic _ u _ produces a self - energy that has a stronger frequency dependence or larger derivative at around the fermi level .",
    "one might anticipate qualitatively that the use of a dynamic _ u _ ought to be counterbalanced by the inclusion of a @xmath7-dependent self - energy to restore the correct mass enhancement .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of momentum- and frequency - dependence of the self - energy on the electronic structure of materials with partially filled narrow bands . to address the forementioned issues , instead of using a model hamiltonian",
    ", we will employ the _ gw _ approximation ( gwa)@xcite which allows us to perform accurate calculations on real materials . as a test material",
    "we study specifically the electronic structure of srvo@xmath6 which has been widely studied in the literature both experimentally by means of photoemission spectroscopy@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "we believe the results are general and will be directly relevant to realistic electronic structure calculations .",
    "the correlation part of the self - energy ( excluding exchange ) in the gwa is given by@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the bare coulomb interaction and @xmath12 is the fully screened interaction calculated within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",

    "it is clear from the figures that the straight lines only cross @xmath69 at one point so that a well - defined satellite feature is not expected .",
    "however , for the unoccupied states at @xmath67 and @xmath57 the straight lines come close to the proximity of @xmath69 and we expect a formation of a weak satellite at around @xmath71 ev above the fermi level .    to see the difference between the local self - energy and the @xmath7-dependent self - energy we plot in fig .",

    "the real part of the local self - energy is shown in fig.[fig : sig ] and similar to the imaginary part , it resembles that of the unoccupied states with little structure below the fermi level .",

    "in fig . [ fig : qp ] the quasiparticle band structures obtained within the lda , the gwa and the local gwa are compared .",
    "the effect of the @xmath7-dependence of the self - energy is striking . the band width obtained from the full @xmath1 calculation",
    "is reduced by almost a factor of two when the @xmath7-dependence is neglected .",

    "however , in the case of srvo@xmath6 , the @xmath1 quasiparticle band width is narrowed from the lda band by only 20 % whereas the @xmath2 factor is about @xmath75 .",
    "the discrepancy between the band narrowing and the @xmath2 factor can be explained by the @xmath7-dependence of the self - energy .",
    "indeed , when the quasiparticle band structure is calculated using a local @xmath1 self - energy it is found that the band width is reduced by one half from its lda value as can be seen in the figure .",
    "thus , the @xmath7-dependent self - energy _ widens _ the dispersion .",
    "this is in accordance with the electron gas result , in which the free - electron occupied band width is reduced by only 10 % by the _",
    "self - energy in the one - shot calculation whereas the @xmath2 factor is about @xmath76 . in the self - consistent calculation",
    "the free - electron occupied band width is _ widened _ , rather than narrowed .",
    "this would be contradictory to the fact that the @xmath2 factor is @xmath77 if the band width were determined by the @xmath2 factor only .",
    "clearly , the @xmath7-dependent self - energy widens the band width .    to understand the origin of the band narrowing when a local self - energy is used , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig2 ] the difference between the full and local self - energies , which represents the nonlocal contribution of the self - energy .",
    "for the occupied states at the @xmath78 and @xmath67 points the difference is negative whereas for the unoccupied states at the @xmath67 and @xmath57 points the difference is positive .",

    "it is known that the gwa tends to overestimate the position of the satellite peak arising from a plasmon excitation .",
    "the position of the plasmon peak in @xmath12 is well described by the rpa but the @xmath1 self - energy is first - order in @xmath12 .",
