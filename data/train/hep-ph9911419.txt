    "one of the main programs at the upcoming b factories is to measure the size of cp violation in as many @xmath2 decay modes as possible so as to establish the pattern of cp violation among various b decays @xcite .",
    "this then may allow for an experimental test not only of the standard model ( sm ) cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) paradigm for cp violation , but also many extensions of the sm that often contain new sources of cp violation .    in this paper",
    ", we continue to study @xcite the distinctive phenomenological implications of a two higgs doublet model for the top quark that is designed to take into account the large mass of the top quark in a natural fashion .",
    "this model contains flavor violation and new sources of @xmath1 violation in the charged higgs sector . in this top - quark two - higgs doublet model ( t2hdm )",
    "first introduced in ref.@xcite , the top quark is assigned a special status by coupling it to one higgs doublet that gets a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , whereas all the other quarks are coupled only to the other higgs doublet whose vev is much smaller .",
    "this arrangement of yukawa interactions is motivated by the mass hierarchy between the top and the other quarks , and the t2hdm can be considered as a special case of the general 2hdm ( type iii)@xcite .",
    "the unique predictions of the model for the @xmath1 asymmetries in both neutral and charged @xmath2 decays should allow for many experimental tests at the @xmath2-factories .",
    "one notable feature about type iii 2hdms is the fact that natural flavor conservation ( nfc ) @xcite is not imposed on the yukawa interactions as is done in models i and ii of 2hdm @xcite .",
    "however , the assumption of nfc is more of a convenience than a necessity @xcite , and this is especially true for the top quark as at the moment there is no experimental data that require it . relaxing the assumption of nfc leads to many interesting phenomenological implications @xcite . as a result ,",
    "three distinctive features arise in this t2hdm which are absent in models with nfc .",
    "firstly , there are new cp - violating phases ( in the charged higgs sector ) besides the ckm phase .",
    "these new phases come from the unitary diagonalization matrix acting on the right - handed ( rh ) up - type quarks . secondly , some charged higgs yukawa couplings are greatly enhanced by the large ratio of the two higgs vevs denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "this is the case , for example , in @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 , whereas these couplings are suppressed by @xmath21 in models with nfc .",
    "these two features have important implications for @xmath22 and @xmath4 mixing , as well as for cp violation in @xmath2 decays .",
    "finally , flavor changing neutral higgs ( fcnh ) couplings exist among the up - type quarks but not the down - type quarks , and could contribute , for example , to @xmath4 mixing at tree level @xcite .",
    "it is the first two aspects of the model that we wish to concentrate on in this work .",
    "an immediate consequence of these two features is the resulting complex tree - level @xmath23 decay amplitudes .",
    "this distinguishes it from many popular models with new physics at the loop level , and it has important implications both for neutral @xmath2 decays to @xmath1 eigenstates and for direct @xmath1 violation in charged @xmath2 decays . in a previous note @xcite , we have highlighted the implications of the model for the @xmath1 asymmetry in the  gold - plated \" mode @xmath24 and found that the asymmetry could take very different values from the sm expectation . in this work , we would like to extend our previous analysis in two ways .    first , we will perform a systematic analysis of the @xmath1 asymmetries in the various @xmath8 and @xmath9 decay channels , including , for example , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "a simple and distinctive pattern of @xmath1 asymmetry emerges from our study . as a result",
    ", studies of the @xmath1 asymmetries in a few @xmath2 decay modes may be utilized to extract information on both the angle @xmath27 associated with the ratio of higgs vevs in the 2hdm , we use @xmath27 to denote one of the angles of the the ckm unitarity triangle .",
    "] of the ckm unitarity triangle ( ut ) and one new @xmath1-violating phase of this model . with more measurements",
    ", one can confirm or rule out the model via consistency checks .",
    "second , on account of the new @xmath1 phase in the higgs - mediated decay amplitudes , we investigate in the t2hdm direct @xmath1-violating effects in charged @xmath2 decays , including @xmath28 and @xmath12 .",
    "the former mode could exhibit a sizable partial rate asymmetry ( pra ) if the strong phase difference is not small .",
    "this mode is of special interest due to its experimental cleanliness and high branching ratio .",
    "the @xmath12 mode is of interest for the measurement of the angle @xmath13 of the unitarity triangle@xcite within the sm where the @xmath4 mixing effect is negligible",
    ". one interesting implication of the t2hdm is that the @xmath4 mixing can be significantly enhanced so that @xmath29 .",
    "improvements in the existing bound on @xmath30 may therefore be very worthwhile .",
    "this possible enhancement arises because the @xmath4 mass difference is quite sensitive to the poorly constrained @xmath31 mixing of the right - handed sector , and a large mass splitting due to charged higgs can occur .",
    "this large @xmath4 mixing can in turn strongly modify the direct @xmath1 asymmetry in @xmath12 .",
    "the implication for the extraction of @xmath13 within the t2hdm will be discussed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : the model is introduced in section ii .",
    "the most stringent experimental constraints from @xmath22 mixing , @xmath6 and @xmath32 decays are presented in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we explore the pattern of @xmath1 asymmetries in neutral @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays .",
    "section v is devoted to the study of direct @xmath1 violation in charged @xmath2 meson decays in the t2hdm , first in @xmath28 , then in @xmath12 .",
    "we conclude with some discussion in section vi .",
    "the fact that the top quark mass is of order the weak scale and is much larger than the other five quarks is suggestive of a different origin for its mass than the other five .",
    "many attempts have been made along this direction , including the dynamical top - condensation model@xcite and the top - color model@xcite . as an alternative to the dynamical models of the top mass and electroweak symmetry breaking , a top - quark 2hdm ( t2hdm ) was proposed @xcite to accommodate the top mass and the weak scale through a separate higgs doublet than the one that is responsible for the masses of the other quarks and all the charged leptons .",
    "the t2hdm can be viewed as an effective low energy parameterization through the yukawa interactions of some high energy dynamics which generates both the top mass and the weak scale .",
    "the two scalar doublets could be composite , as in top - color models , and the yukawa interactions could be the residual effect of some higher energy four - fermi operators . indeed , some similarities can be noted @xcite in the effective low energy flavor physics between dynamical top models and certain model iii 2hdms including the t2hdm .    the yukawa interaction of the t2hdm can be simply written as follows , @xmath33 where the two higgs doublets are denoted by @xmath34 with @xmath35 @xmath36 , and where the @xmath37 yukawa matrices @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 give masses respectively to the charged leptons , the down and up type quarks ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are two orthogonal projection operators onto the first two and the third families respectively , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the usual left - handed quark and lepton doublets .",
    "the heaviness of the top quark arises as a result of the much larger vev of @xmath45 to which no other quark couples . as a result",
    ", one notable feature about this model is that the ratio of the two higgs vevs , @xmath46 , is required to be large so that the yukawa couplings of the top and bottom quarks are similar in magnitude .",
    "we will take @xmath47 in the following analysis .",
    "this assignment of yukawa couplings is not in line with the notion of nfc , and this leads to two tree level fcnh interactions , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , both of which are not constrained by present data .",
    "some phenomenological studies of the neutral higgs sector , including the effect on @xmath50 mixing , can be found in  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "only little attention has been paid to the charged higgs sector@xcite , and it is this aspect of the model on which we would like to focus .",

    "in this subsection , we address the use of charged @xmath2 decays to search for direct cp violation . this requires a difference in the strong phases associated with the @xmath66- and @xmath67-mediated decay amplitudes leading to the exclusive final state(s ) of interest . as an illustration",
    ", we will focus our attention on the decay @xmath65 .",
    "there are several features about this mode which make it interesting to study both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the @xmath65 decays proceed through the quark decay @xmath68 and its conjugate process . in the sm ,",
    "the weak phase associated with the decay amplitude is vanishingly small ; therefore , the sm predicts a zero rate asymmetry .",
    "second , it is clean to measure experimentally . third , it has a large branching ratio of @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "these features make the experimental measurement very worthwhile in the search for new sources of @xmath1 violation .",
    "however , as we can not reliably compute the hadronic matrix elements of either the sm current - current four - fermi operator or the charged - higgs - induced scalar operator , the relative strong phase between the @xmath66- and @xmath67-mediated amplitudes remains largely unknown .",
    "therefore , no reliable predictions can be made about the size of the asymmetry .",
    "formally , the amplitude for @xmath70 can be written as = a_sm [ 1 - e^-i e^-i_s ] . where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the weak and strong phase difference respectively .",
    "it then follows that the amplitude for @xmath73 is given as = _ sm [ 1 - e^+i e^-i_s ] .    the cp - violating partial rate asymmetry ( pra )",
    "can be expressed as a_cp = = . as @xmath74 is directly proportional to @xmath75",
    "when @xmath75 is small , it is crucial to determine how large @xmath75 can be after imposing the experimental constraints . from section  [ sec : constraints ] , we know that the most stringent constraints on @xmath75 come from the @xmath76 rate , the @xmath77-@xmath78 mass difference @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . for @xmath81 , the combined constraints from @xmath79 ( see eq.([eq : mkbound ] ) ) and @xmath76 ( see fig .  [ figbsg ] ) imply an upper bound of @xmath82 as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figbsg ] , this limit is saturated for @xmath83 , and becomes more stringent as the phase @xmath71 increases all the way to @xmath84 . imposing the @xmath80 constraint may generally make @xmath75 even smaller , depending on the ckm phase and @xmath71 ( see fig .  1 of ref.@xcite for an illustration ) .",
    "suffice it to say that after taking all the data into account , @xmath74 could be of order @xmath85 in the t2hdm unless the strong phase @xmath72 is much suppressed , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figdcp ] .    4 truein    .2 cm    recall that in the sm , the pra has to come from the interference between the tree diagram and a loop diagram with internal @xmath86-quark which gives the required weak phase difference , arg[@xmath87 .",
    "consequently , the rate asymmetry in the sm is both loop- and cabibbo - suppressed and is expected to be vanishingly small . in the t2hdm , on the other hand , the @xmath1 asymmetry arises from the interference between two tree diagrams , and may only be suppressed by the relative strength of the two amplitudes , @xmath75 . as a result , rate asymmetry at the @xmath85 level can be naturally expected with @xmath88 , at least in those exclusive channels where the strong phase difference is not too suppressed .",
    "we remark , in passing , that the cpt theorem does not impose any particular restriction on a specific channel ( such as @xmath89 ) , materializing from @xmath90 as there are many other channels originating from the same quark transition . indeed , in the next subsection",
    ", we will discuss a similar case where large direct @xmath1 asymmetry is expected , based purely on the sm , in exclusive channels emerging from quark - level interference between two tree graphs .    to estimate the number of @xmath2 s needed in order to measure a @xmath85 asymmetry at the @xmath91 level",

    "indeed , the existing data sample ( @xmath95 s ) at cleo can already be used for this important search@xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the possibility of sizable direct cp violating effect in @xmath28 in the t2hdm does not arise in 2hdm s with nfc ( models i and ii ) where the @xmath66 and @xmath67 exchange amplitudes have the same weak phase .",
    "note also that large cp asymmetries may also be expected in charged @xmath2 decays through @xmath96 and its conjugate process , for example , in @xmath97 ( the sm expectation for the @xmath1 asymmetry in this mode is small ) .",
    "however , the branching ratio for this decay is cabibbo - suppressed by a factor of @xmath98 compared to that of @xmath28 .    before leaving this subsection ,",
