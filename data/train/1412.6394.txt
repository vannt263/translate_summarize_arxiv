    "after the first run of the lhc at a centre of mass ( c.m . ) energy of mostly 8  tev , no significant excesses have been observed in searches for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . amongst others ,",
    "this concerns searches for supersymmetric particles ( sparticles ) like squarks , gluinos , electroweak gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "lower bounds on the masses of sparticles have been obtained  @xcite which depend , however , on the sparticle decay cascades and hence on the complete sparticle spectrum .",
    "recent summaries of bounds within various scenarios can be found in  @xcite . in particular , for similar squark masses @xmath4 and gluino masses @xmath5 and decay cascades motivated by the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , atlas obtained @xmath6  tev  @xcite .",
    "weaker limits are obtained within simplified models where , for instance , gluinos are assumed to be decoupled in the case of squark production .",
    "( decoupled gluinos imply reduced squark production cross sections and , for similar squark and gluino masses , the largest production cross sections are the ones corresponding to one squark plus one gluino production . ) in any case , these lower bounds have already put the mssm under a certain stress .    searches for squarks , gluinos and sparticles rely in general ( assuming conserved r - parity ) on events with large missing transverse energy @xmath7 ( met ) due to the escaping stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is a good dark matter candidate if neutral .",
    "since corresponding cuts on @xmath7 are applied , these searches are less effective if , for kinematical reasons , the lsp produced in the last step @xmath8 of a sparticle decay chain is always soft and carries little energy .",
    "( nlsp denotes the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle . )",
    "this is the case if the lsp is very light ( @xmath9 few gev ) and , simultaneously , @xmath10 corresponds to a standard model particle , with @xmath11 close to ( just below ) @xmath12 .",
    "a possible standard model particle @xmath10 is the 125  gev higgs boson , although additional non - sm - like higgs bosons ( or the @xmath13 boson ) could also play that role . in the general mssm",
    "such a scenario can not be realised in practise : whereas a bino - like lsp could be in principle very light and a wino- or higgsino - like nlsp have a mass close to 125 gev + @xmath14 , most squarks ( and sleptons ) would then prefer to decay directly into the lsp , skipping the step @xmath8 .",
    "however , if this step is not present in nearly all sparticle decays , existing lower bounds on sparticle masses are hardly alleviated due to the other decay processes with an energetic lsp and large @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , in extensions of the mssm it is possible that the lsp has only weak couplings to all sparticles present in the mssm . then the mssm - like sparticles ( squarks , gluinos etc . )",
    "avoid direct decays into the lsp , but their decay cascades end up ( provisionally ) in the `` mssm - like lsp '' , typically the bino .",
    "only subsequently does the `` mssm - like lsp '' ( now the nlsp ) decay into the `` true '' lsp  @xmath15 , always leading to a soft lsp for configurations of masses as stated above .",
    "scenarios of that kind have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the role of the `` true '' lsp can be played by a light gravitino ( provided the decay of the mssm - like lsp happens inside the detector  otherwise it behaves like the true lsp )  @xcite , so - called photini  @xcite , or the singlino of the nmssm  @xcite .",
    "the nmssm denotes the next - to - minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model  @xcite where the coupling of the two higgs doublets of the mssm to an additional gauge singlet field @xmath16 solves the @xmath17-problem of the mssm  @xcite , and renders more natural a value of @xmath18  gev of the sm - like higgs boson  @xcite , while preserving the attractive features of the mssm . besides the higgs sector",
    ", the nmssm differs from the mssm through the presence of an additional neutralino ( the singlino , the fermionic component of the singlet superfield ) .",
    "the singlino can be a light lsp , weakly coupled to the mssm - like sparticles .",
    "a scenario with such a soft singlino - like lsp in the nmssm was also briefly discussed in  @xcite and in a variant of the nmssm including non - renormalisable terms in  @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite we studied in detail to which extent the reduction of @xmath7 due to a light singlino in the nmssm can alleviate the lower bounds on squark and gluino masses from the run  i of the lhc .",
    "we presented a `` worst case scenario '' with all sparticle masses below @xmath19  tev , but consistent with constraints from the lhc .",
    "the dominant limits on such scenarios with little @xmath7 actually originate from searches for many hard jets as in  @xcite . one particular feature of the scenario presented in  @xcite is that the role of @xmath10 is played by a nmssm - specific higgs boson lighter than @xmath20 ( but not ruled out by lep ) .",
    "such light higgs bosons have very small branching ratios ( @xmath21s ) into @xmath22 with subsequent leptonic decays of @xmath23 leading to neutrinos .",
    "neutrino decays generate @xmath7 , which makes corresponding scenarios somewhat more sensitive to standard supersymmetry search channels .",
    "the production of higgs bosons from neutralino cascades has been studied before in variants of the mssm  @xcite and the nmssm  @xcite .",
    "the possible reduction of @xmath7 due to a softer lsp in such decays was observed in  @xcite , but the emphasis was mainly on neutralino decays as additional sources of higgs bosons .",
    "since these can be considerably boosted , analyses of the substructure of the resulting jets have been proposed in  @xcite .    in the present paper we concentrate , in contrast to  @xcite , on the possible excessive production of pairs of standard model - like 125  gev higgs bosons , @xmath24 .",
    "the `` worst case scenarios '' discussed in  @xcite relied , for reasons stated above , on the production of a lighter nmssm - specific higgs boson @xmath25 in the @xmath26 cascade and , moreover , it was assumed that squarks @xmath27 directly decay into quarks and the bino in order to alleviate as much as possible the constraints from searches based on @xmath7 and jets . here",
    "we study scenarios with longer squark decay cascades : squarks decaying via gluinos and/or gluinos decaying via stops / sbottoms .",
    "the final step in the decay cascades is always assumed to be @xmath28 , hence @xmath7 is still strongly reduced , making standard searches for supersymmetry less efficient .",
    "the aim is then to see whether signals of two standard model - like 125  gev higgs bosons @xmath24 can be extracted ( above the standard model background ) in order not to miss squark / gluino production at the 13  tev c.m .",
    "energy run  ii at the lhc .",
    "to this end we present benchmark points with squark / gluino masses in the 1 - 1.5  tev range , which are not excluded by searches from run  i. the benchmark points differ in the decay cascades ; if stops / sbottoms appear therein , their masses are assumed to be @xmath29  gev ( the precise values of their masses have little impact on the final signatures ) . in each case",
    "we perform simulations and attempt to extract signals of two standard model - like 125  gev higgs bosons @xmath24 above the background , concentrating as in  @xcite on final states with @xmath30 and a @xmath31 pair , the invariant masses of the latter near the higgs mass .    in the next section we present the scenarios and the corresponding benchmark points in more detail . in section  3",
    "we describe the simulations , the analysis and the dominant backgrounds . in section  4 we collect the results for the benchmark points and discuss which of their properties can help to distinguish the various scenarios .",
    "section  5 is devoted to a summary and conclusions .",
    "as described in the introduction and discussed in more detail in  @xcite , a loss of @xmath7 ( associated to the lsp ) in sparticle decay cascades can occur in the nmssm if a dominantly singlino - like lsp is light , the mass of the typically mostly bino - like nlsp @xmath32 is somewhat above the sum of a higgs and lsp masses @xmath33 , and practically all sparticle decay cascades terminate by a last step @xmath34 .",
    "( decays @xmath35 occur only if the nlsp has a higgsino component , i.e. if the effective @xmath17 parameter @xmath36 of the nmssm  @xcite is relatively small , which we do not assume here for simplicity . )",
    "the case where @xmath37 corresponds to a nmssm - specific higgs scalar with a mass below @xmath20 was investigated in  @xcite ( in order to reduce as much as possible @xmath7 in all decay processes ) ; here we consider the standard model - like @xmath38 and , accordingly , a bino - like nlsp mass somewhat above 125  gev , as such scenarios are equally possible in the general nmssm .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to propose and study benchmark points for squark / gluino production which , due to the reduction of @xmath7 , would be difficult to observe in standard supersymmetry search channels relying on large cuts on @xmath7 .",
    "instead , we show that  for not too heavy squarks and large enough integrated luminosity  such scenarios are observable in searches for two higgs bosons accompanied by hard jets .",
    "the benchmark points considered here include scenarios where squarks decay via gluinos , leading to more jets in the final state but with reduced transverse momenta of the ( s)particles involved in the last decay step .",
    "gluinos lighter than squarks can undergo 3-body decays into two quarks and a bino or , if kinematically allowed , 2-body decays into top - stop or bottom - sbottom pairs .",
    "decay chains involving charginos or heavier neutralinos are left aside here as their decays via @xmath39 or @xmath13 bosons can lead to neutrinos , and the @xmath7 from the latter @xmath40 s is often sufficient to make standard supersymmetry searches ( possibly including isolated leptons ) sensitive to these scenarios .",
    "direct production of charginos or heavier neutralinos with subsequent higgs pair production instead of @xmath7 merits a separate analysis .",
    "the subsequent benchmark points will not be defined in terms of parameters of the nmssm but , for convenience , in terms of masses and branching fractions of the involved sparticles .",
    "however , these are chosen such that they can be reproduced at least approximatively by suitable parameters of the nmssm as we have checked using nmssmtools_4.4.0  @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite it was found that the loss of @xmath7 is not very sensitive to the masses of the particles involved in the decay @xmath34 as long as @xmath41 , and we verified that this also holds for the signals obtained below .",
    "hence we do not vary these masses and choose for all benchmark points @xmath42  gev , @xmath43  gev , @xmath44  gev and 100%  @xmath21 for the decay @xmath45 .",
    "for the squark masses @xmath46 and gluino masses @xmath47 we choose values such that the benchmark points are not ruled out by searches at the run  i at the lhc ( using checkmate  @xcite for the standard supersymmetry search channels ) .",
    "all squarks of the first two generations are assumed degenerated . as stated above",
    ", the points differ by their squark  @xmath48  lsp decay chains , and for completeness we start with points for which this chain is as short as possible : decoupled stops and sbottoms , and gluinos only slightly heavier than  almost degenerate with  squarks .",
    "( squarks much lighter than the gluino are unstable under radiative corrections and would imply an unnatural tuning of bare squark mass parameters . )",
    "the squark , gluino and stop / sbottom masses of the eight points p1  p8 are shown in table  1 , where we also include the sums of squark - squark , squark - antisquark , squark - gluino and gluino - gluino cross sections @xmath49 as obtained from prospino at nlo  @xcite .",
    "points p1 and p2 are examples of short decay chains ; for p1 the squark / gluino masses are slightly above the lower bounds from the lhc run  i ( i.e. @xmath19  tev , taken @xmath50  gev heavier than in the `` worst case scenario '' studied in  @xcite ) while the squark / gluino masses have somewhat more pessimistic values of @xmath51  tev for p2 .",
    "both squark and gluino production contribute to the total production cross section .",
    "gluinos heavier than squarks are assumed to decay democratically into all squark - quark pairs of the first two generations , and squarks lighter than gluinos with 100% @xmath21 into the bino - like nlsp and the corresponding quark : @xmath52 .",
    ".squark , gluino , stop and sbottom masses ( unless decoupled ) and the sum of squark - gluino production cross sections at nlo for the benchmark points p1  p8 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     despite the statistical fluctuations , the following trends can be observed :    * points p1 , p2 , p5 and p6 , with gluinos heavier than squarks ( i.e. squarks decaying directly into a quark and the bino ) , have @xmath53 ( actually @xmath54 except for p5 with gluinos decaying into top / stop ) ; @xmath55 indicates longer squark cascades via gluinos as for p3 , p4 , p7 and p8 .",
    "of course , @xmath56 increases also with the squark masses , as is visible when comparing p1/p2 and p3/p4 .",
    "* points p1 , p2 , p3 and p4 without stops / sbottoms in the gluino decay cascades all have @xmath57 . once gluinos can decay into stops / sbottoms , but for gluinos still heavier than squarks  as for p5 and p6  , we have @xmath58 . with stops",
    "/ sbottoms in gluino decays and squarks heavier than gluinos ( as for p7 and p8 ) , we have @xmath59 .    finally , we recall that points p5/p7 with gluinos decaying via top / stop have sizeable @xmath7 from leptonic top decays ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , which allows to distinguish them from points p6/p8 , in which gluinos decay via bottom / sbottom pairs .",
    "these differences appear clear and easily distinguishable since the benchmark points correspond to simplified models with ( mostly ) 100% branching fractions into given channels .",
    "still , together with the signal rates , the discussed observables would give strong hints on the underlying sparticle spectrum .",
    "in the presence of a light singlino - like lsp in the nmssm and an nlsp with a mass slightly above the threshold for the nlsp  @xmath48  lsp + higgs decay , the @xmath7 signature of sparticle production is considerably reduced . in these scenarios the upper bounds on squark / gluino masses from the run  i at the lhc are alleviated , and search strategies not relying on large @xmath7 would also be required for the run  ii at 13  tev c.m . energy .",
    "we have proposed benchmark points corresponding to different squark / gluino masses and decay cascades , and studied the prospects for search strategies relying on two higgs bosons in the final state .",
    "the proposed cuts lead to large signal - to - background ratios for all masses and decay cascades considered here , but can still be optimised after realistic detector simulations . this may be required for squark / gluino masses at or beyond the 1.4/1.5  tev range , where the small signal cross sections after our cuts would require several 100  fb@xmath60 of integrated luminosity ; looser cuts could be of help here .",
    "the scenario with a light singlino - like lsp in the nmssm would also influence searches for direct stop / sbottom pair production , as well as searches for direct neutralino / chargino production . in all these cases ,",
    "@xmath7 would be reduced as well , and two higgs bosons would appear instead in the decay cascades .",
    "dedicated search strategies for these cases for the run  ii at the lhc remain to be devised .",
