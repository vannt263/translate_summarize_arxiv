    "i came across a certain set of legendrian links while searching for examples to illustrate the main theorem of my thesis @xcite , and they served that purpose very well .",
    "since then i kept returning to them because i could always discover something pretty .",
    "this paper is a collection of those findings .",
    "the links in question ( see figure [ fig : lagpic ] ) , that i call _ legendrian closures of positive braids _ , denote by @xmath1 , and represent by front diagrams @xmath2 , are legendrian representatives of braid - positive links , i.e.  link types that can be obtained as the closure of a positive braid @xmath3 .",
    "( these are not to be confused with the more general notion of positive link , i.e.  link types that can be represented with diagrams whose geometric and algebraic crossing numbers agree . )",
    "in fact i conjecture that @xmath1 is essentially the only legendrian representative of such a link type , in the following sense .",
    "any braid - positive legendrian link is a stabilization of the corresponding legendrian closure shown in figure [ fig : lagpic ] . in particular ,",
    "braid - positive links are legendrian simple .",
    "this paper however is not about compiling evidence for this conjecture .",
    "let us only mention that etnyre and honda @xcite proved it for positive torus knots , that the set of links treated by ding and geiges @xcite includes many two - component braid - positive links ( for example , positive @xmath4 torus links ) , and that chekanov s example @xcite of a non - legendrian simple knot type is @xmath5 , which is the smallest positive , but not braid - positive knot .",
    "also , by rutherford s work @xcite , the thurston  bennequin number of @xmath1 is maximal in its smooth isotopy class because the front diagram @xmath2 is easily seen to admit rulings ( see section [ sec : rul ] ) . because some ( actually , all ) of those rulings are @xmath6graded , the maximal thurston  bennequin number is only attained along with rotation number @xmath7 .    instead",
    ", we will concentrate on legendrian isotopy invariants of @xmath1 .",
    "some of these have been evaluated in @xcite , of which the present paper is a continuation .",
    "it is thus assumed that the reader is familiar with sections 2 ( basic notions ) and 6 ( legendrian closures of positive braids and their relative contact homology ) of @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will re - formulate some of those computations , and get new results also , by using what we call the path matrix of a positive braid .",
    "this construction is very similar to that of lindstrm @xcite and gessel ",
    "viennot @xcite , which is also included in the volume @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review some results of @xcite in section [ sec : prelim ] , and discuss elementary properties of the path matrix in section [ sec : matrix ] .",
    "then , the main results are theorem [ thm : ideal ] , where we compute a new generating set for the ( abelianized ) image @xmath8 of the contact homology differential and its consequence , theorem [ thm : gauss ] , which gives a quick test to decide whether a given set of crossings is an augmentation .",
    "the latter is in terms of an @xmath0decomposition , i.e.  gaussian elimination of the path matrix . in theorem [ thm :",
    "grob ] , we point out that the old generators , i.e. the ones read off of the knot diagram , automatically form a grbner basis for @xmath8 . in theorem [ thm :",
    "szimultan ] , we construct a subset of the crossings of @xmath3 which is simultaneously an augmentation and a ruling of @xmath1 . this strengthens the well known relationship between augmentations and rulings .",
    "we close the paper with a few examples .",
    "acknowledgements : part of the research was carried out in the summer of 2005 when i visited the alfrd rnyi mathematical institute in budapest .",
    "it is a great pleasure to thank the institute for their hospitality and andrs nmethi , endre szab , and andrs szcs for stimulating discussions .",
    "i am grateful to alexander stoimenow for providing me with a list of braid - positive knots up to @xmath9 crossings .",

    "we will also assume that the reader is familiar with section 6 of @xcite , of which this paper is in a sense an extension .",
    "for a complete introduction to legendrian knots and their contact homology , see @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress a few points only whose treatment may be somewhat non - standard . crossings @xmath18 of both front and lagrangian diagrams are assigned an _ index _ , denoted by @xmath19 , which is an element of @xmath20 , with the entire assignment known as a _",

    "the maslov potential difference becomes ambiguous for crossings between different components .",

    "[ rem : csuszas ] when the braid group relation @xmath58 , @xmath59 is applied to change @xmath3 , the diagram @xmath22 only changes by an isotopy of the plane and the path matrix @xmath53 hardly changes at all .",
    "in fact if we do nt insist on increasing label indices and re - label the braid as on the right side of figure [ fig : haromszog ] , then @xmath53 remains the same .",
    "therefore such changes in braid words will be largely ignored in the paper .",
    "the path matrix behaves multiplicatively in the following sense : if two positive braid words @xmath60 and @xmath61 on @xmath23 strands are multiplied as in the braid group ( placing @xmath61 to the right of @xmath60 ) to form the braid word @xmath62 , then @xmath63 note that for this to hold true , @xmath60 and @xmath61 have to carry their own individual crossing labels that @xmath62 inherits , too .",
    "otherwise , the observation is trivial : we may group together paths from left endpoint @xmath47 to right endpoint @xmath48 in @xmath62 by the position of their crossing over from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "apart from the technicality of having to view @xmath64 and @xmath65 as polynomials of separate sets of indeterminates , there are other problems that so far prevented the author from defining a representation of the positive braid semigroup based on .",
    "namely , when we represent the same positive braid by a different braid word , the path matrix changes . this can be somewhat controlled by requiring , as another departure from our convention of increasing label subscripts , that whenever the braid group relation @xmath66 is applied to change @xmath3 , the two sets of labels are related as on the right side of figure [ fig : haromszog ] . then the path matrix changes @xmath67 notice that this is just an application of chekanov s chain map @xcite relating the dga s of the diagrams before and after a reidemeister iii move ( and the same happens if the triangle is part of a larger braid ) .",
    "therefore we may hope that the path matrix of a positive braid @xmath3 , with its _ entries viewed as elements of the relative contact homology @xmath68 _ , is independent of the braid word representing @xmath3 .",
    "this is indeed the case because the set of equivalent positive geometric braids ( with the endpoints of strands fixed ) is contractible , thus it is possible to canonically identify the contact homologies coming from different diagrams .",
    "but because there is nt any known relation between the contact homologies of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , this does nt help us .",

    "consider the braid @xmath3 shown in figure [ fig:111 ] .",
    "its path matrix is @xmath75 ( the path contributing @xmath76 to @xmath77 is shown . ) as @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 . thus in the dga of @xmath22 , the relations @xmath82 and @xmath83 hold .          the inverse of the elementary matrix @xmath84 is @xmath85.\\ ] ] therefore , writing @xmath86 , from @xmath87 we see that @xmath88 is also a path matrix of the same braid word @xmath3 , but in a different sense .",
    "this time , the @xmath89entry is a sum of the following products : for each path composed of parts of the strands of @xmath3 that connects the _ right _ endpoint labeled @xmath47 to the _ left _ endpoint labeled @xmath48 so that it only turns at quadrants facing _ down _ , take the product of the crossings from right to left that it turns at .",
    "so it s as if we turned @xmath3 upside down by a @xmath90 rotation while keeping the original labels of the crossings and of the endpoints of the strands .",
    "that operation on the braid word produces a legendrian isotopic closure ( where by closure we mean adding strands above the braid , as in figure [ fig : lagpic ] ) .",
    "this is seen by a two - step process .",
    "first , apply ` half - way ' the conjugation move of @xcite ( as in figure [ fig : felszalad ] ) successively to each crossing of @xmath3 from left to right .",
    "this turns @xmath3 upside down , but now the closing strands are underneath .    then , repeat @xmath23 times the procedure shown in figure [ fig : felfordul ] , which we borrow from @xcite",
    ". the box may contain any front diagram . before the move represented by the third arrow",
    ", we make the undercrossing strand on the left steeper than all slopes that occur inside the box , so that it slides underneath the entire diagram without a self - tangency moment .",
    "( in @xmath10space , increasing the slope results in a huge @xmath91coordinate .",
    "recall that fronts appear on the @xmath14plane , in particular the @xmath91axis points away from the observer .",
    "so the motion of the strand happens far away , way behind any other piece of the knot . )",
    "the inverse of the matrix from the previous example is @xmath92 in figure [ fig:111 ] , the path contributing @xmath93 to the @xmath94 entry is shown .      as an illustration",
    ", we examine the path matrices of permutation braids , which are positive braids in which every pair of strands crosses at most once .",
    "they are in a one - to - one correspondence with elements of the symmetric group @xmath95 and they play a crucial role in garside s solution @xcite of the word and conjugacy problems in the braid group @xmath96 .",
    "it is always possible to represent a braid with a braid word in which the product @xmath97 does nt appear for any @xmath47 .",
    "( that is , all possible triangle moves in which the `` middle strand is pushed down , '' as in figure [ fig : haromszog ] viewed from the right to the left , have been performed . )",
    "such _ reduced braid words _ for permutation braids ( up to the relation @xmath58 , @xmath59 ; see remark [ rem : csuszas ] ) are unique .",
    "let @xmath98 .",
    "the path matrix @xmath99 associated to its reduced permutation braid word is obtained from the permutation matrix @xmath57 as follows .",
    "changes are only made to entries that are above the @xmath12 in their column and to the left of the @xmath12 in their row . at each such position",
    ", a single crossing label appears in @xmath99 .    in particular , the positions that carry different entries in @xmath57 and @xmath99 are in a one - to - one correspondence with the inversions of @xmath54 .",
    "starting at the left endpoint labeled @xmath47 , our first `` intended destination '' ( on the right side of the braid ) is @xmath100 .",
    "whenever we turn along a path in the braid , the intended destination becomes a smaller number because the two strands do nt meet again .",
    "this shows that entries in @xmath99 that are to the right of the @xmath12 in their row are @xmath7 .",
    "traversing the braid from right to left , we see that entries under the @xmath12 in their column are @xmath7 , too .",
    "either one of the two arguments shows that the @xmath12 s of @xmath57 are left unchanged in @xmath99 .",
    "( this part of the proof is valid for any positive braid word representing a permutation braid ; cf .",
    "figure [ fig : haromszog ] and equation . )",
    "we claim that any path in the braid contributing to any @xmath46 can contain at most one turn .",
    "assume the opposite : then a strand @xmath41 crosses under the strand @xmath101 and then over the strand @xmath102 , which are different and which have to cross each other as well .",
    "this contradicts our assumption that the braid word is reduced , for it is easy to argue that ( in a permutation braid ) the triangle @xmath103 that we have just found must contain an elementary triangle as on the right side of figure [ fig : haromszog ] .",

    "on the other hand , for the purposes of the argument , over- and undercrossing information in the braids is irrelevant .",
