    "it has long been appreciated  @xcite that a generic three - dimensional turbulent flow of a conducting fluid is likely to be a _ dynamo , _",
    "i.e. , it amplifies an initial weak seed magnetic field provided the magnetic reynolds number is above a certain instability threshold ( usually between  10 and  100 ) .",
    "the amplification is exponentially fast and occurs due to stretching of the magnetic field lines by the random velocity shear associated with the turbulent eddies .",
    "the same mechanism leads to an equally rapid decrease of the field s spatial coherence scale , as the stretching and folding by the ambient flow brings the field lines with oppositely directed fields ever closer together  @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic prandtl number ( @xmath0 , the ratio of the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity of the fluid ) is large and the hydrodynamic turbulence has kolmogorov form , the scale of the magnetic field can decrease by a factor of  @xmath1 below the viscous scale of the fluid .",
    "this situation is known as _ the batchelor regime _",
    "@xcite and is characterized by the magnetic - energy concentration at subviscous scales .",
    "this mhd regime is very common in astrophysical plasmas , which tend to have very low density and high temperature .",
    "examples include warm interstellar medium , some accretion discs , jets , protogalaxies , intracluster gas in galaxy clusters , early universe ,  etc .",
    "( a representative set of recent references is  @xcite ) .",
    "the object of our principal interest are magnetic fields of galaxies , often thought to have been generated by the turbulent dynamo in the interstellar medium .",
    "the challenge is to reconcile the preponderance of small - scale magnetic fluctuations resulting from the weak - field ( kinematic ) stage of the dynamo with the observed galactic fields coherent at scales of approximately 1  kpc , or 10  times larger than the outer scale of the interstellar turbulence , which is forced by supernova explosions at scales of  @xmath2  pc ( @xcite are some of the recent reviews of relevant observations ) .",
    "the galactic magnetic fields generally have energies comparable to the energy of the turbulent motions of the interstellar medium , and , therefore , can not be considered weak .",
    "indeed , the growth of the magnetic energy established for the kinematic regime inevitably leads to the field becoming strong enough to resist further amplification and to modify the properties of the ambient turbulence by exerting a force ( lorentz tension ) on the fluid .",
    "this marks the transition from the kinematic ( linear ) stage of the dynamo to the nonlinear regime . in the astrophysical context ,",
    "the main issue is what happens to the coherence scale of the field during the nonlinear stage and , specifically , whether a mechanism could be envisioned that would effectively transfer the magnetic energy from small ( subviscous ) to velocity scales : perhaps as large as the outer scale of the turbulence and above .",
    "a large amount of work has been devoted to this issue during the last 50  years ( a small subset of the relevant references is  @xcite ) . since most phenomenological theories of the _ steady - state _",
    "mhd turbulence envision a state of eventual detailed scale - by - scale equipartition between magnetic and velocity energies  @xcite , it has been widely expected that the dynamo would converge to such a state via some form of inverse cascade of magnetic energy .",
    "the implication would be an eventual dominant magnetic - energy concentration at the outer scale of the turbulence  a convenient starting point for the operation of the helical mean - field dynamo  @xcite or of the helical inverse cascade  @xcite .",
    "note that we believe the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity that takes place in helical mhd turbulence  @xcite to be unrelated to the small - scale processes we discuss here : we are interested in ways to shift the magnetic energy from subviscous scales to the outer ( forcing ) scale of the turbulence , while the helical inverse cascade transfers magnetic helicity from the forcing scale to even larger scales . in the galactic dynamo theory , helicity - related effects should not be relevant for the small - scale turbulence because they operate at the time scale associated with the overall rotation of the galaxy , which is 10 times larger than the turnover time of the largest turbulent eddies ( @xmath3 and @xmath4  years , respectively  @xcite ) .    to prevent confusion ,",
    "let us spell out that by _ turbulent dynamo _ we mean the turbulent amplification of the energy of magnetic _ fluctuations _ , not of the mean field .",
    "fluctuation - dynamo theories describe magnetic fields at the scales of the turbulence , mean - field - dynamo theories refer to much larger scales ( the mean field is usually the field averaged over the flow scales ) .",
    "while fast mean - field dynamo is not possible in an isotropic system without net helicity ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the fluctuation dynamo is  @xcite .",
    "moreover , fluctuation dynamos in three - dimensional turbulent flows are usually fast , i.e. , proceed at a finite rate in the limit of arbitrarily small magnetic diffusivity .",
    "thus , in this work , we study the possibility of the nonhelical , nonlinear , large-@xmath5 fluctuation dynamo saturating with magnetic energy concentrated at the outer scale of the turbulence . using a simple spectral fokker  planck model inspired by the quantitative theory of the kinematic stage of the dynamo and by a physical model of the nonlinear stage , we establish a possible mechanism for shifting the bulk of the magnetic energy from the subviscous scales to the velocity scales .",
    "the energy transfer mechanism proposed here involves selective resistive decay of small - scale fields combined with continued amplification of the field at larger scales .",
    "therefore , the time needed for this process to complete itself turns out to be the resistive time associated with the velocity scales of the turbulence , _ not _ a dynamical time . in large-@xmath5 systems ,",
    "this time is enormously long and , in fact , can easily exceed the age of the universe . thus , a steady state with magnetic energy at velocity scales , even if attainable in principle , is not relevant for such systems .",
    "however , the scenario of the evolution and saturation of the nonlinear dynamo proposed here has fundamental implications for our understanding of the structure of the forced isotropic mhd turbulence and of the results of the recent numerical experiments .",
    "the plan of the rest of this paper is as follows . in ,",
    "we review the kinematic theory .",
    "it is worked out in some detail because it constitutes the mathematical framework of the subsequent nonlinear extension presented in . in",
    ", a phenomenological theory of the nonlinear dynamo is proposed .",
    "this section contains our main physical argument and is , therefore , the part of this paper that a reader not interested in details should peruse before jumping to the discussion section at the end . in",
    "we proceed to formulate a fokker ",
    "planck model of the evolution of the magnetic - energy spectrum .",
    "the model is then solved numerically and analytically .",
    "self - similar solutions are obtained .",
    "both the qualitative physics of and the analytical solutions of exhibit a resistively controlled effective transfer of the magnetic energy to the velocity scales .",
    "the resulting long - time asymptotic state of the fully developed isotropic mhd turbulence is discussed in . contains a discussion of our findings and of the issues left open in our approach .",
    "the kinematic dynamo is described by the induction equation [ ind_eq ] _ t+ = + , where @xmath6  is the magnetic field , @xmath7  is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath8  is the random incompressible velocity field , whose statistics are externally prescribed .",
    "the following _ exact _ evolution law for the magnetic energy  @xmath9 is an immediate corollary of  : [ w_eq_exact ] w = 2(t ) w - 2 ^ 2(t ) w , where , by definition , ( t)= : , ^2(t ) = @xmath10@xmath10 = 1w_0^kk^2 m(t , k ) , and @xmath11 is the @xmath12-shell - integrated magnetic - energy spectrum .",
    "the angle brackets signify ensemble averages , but , the system being homogeneous , can also be thought of as volume integrals .",
    "batchelor  @xcite argued that , in a turbulent flow , @xmath13  would tend to some constant  @xmath14 , thus implying exponential growth of the magnetic energy .",
    "this is essentially a consequence of the line - stretching property of turbulence  @xcite .",
    "the growth of the magnetic energy is accompanied by the decrease of the characteristic scale of the magnetic fluctuations , which also proceeds exponentially fast in time at a rate  @xmath15  @xcite . in a large-@xmath5 medium ,",
    "this process quickly transfers the bulk of the magnetic energy to scales below the hydrodynamic viscous cutoff . in the kolmogorov turbulence ,",
    "the fastest eddies are the viscous - scale ones , so it is their turnover time that determines the time scale at which the small - scale kinematic dynamo operates : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18  are the characteristic wave number and velocity of these eddies  @xcite .",
    "since the subviscous - scale magnetic fields `` see '' the ambient flow as a random linear shear , one might conjecture that their statistics should not be very sensitive to the specific structure of the flow , provided the latter is sufficiently random in space and time .",
    "this gives a physical rationale for modelling the ambient turbulence with some synthetic random velocity field whose statistics would be simple enough to render the problem analytically solvable . the most eminently successful such scheme has been the kazantsev  kraichnan model of passive advection  @xcite which uses a gaussian white - in - time velocity as a stand - in for the real turbulence : [ kk_field ] u^i(t,)u^j(t, ) = ( t - t)^ij(- ) . on the basis of this model , it is possible to show that the magnetic - energy spectrum at subviscous scales ( @xmath19 ) satisfies the following equation  @xcite [ ssf_eq ] _ t m = 5@xmath20 - 2k^2 m , where  @xmath21_{\\vy=0}$ ] , which is consistent with its physical meaning as the characteristic eddy - turnover rate of the turbulence  @xcite .",
    "note that , in order for equation   to be an adequate description of the spectral properties of the magnetic field , it must be a conservative approximation , i.e. , be consistent with the exact energy - evolution law  .",
    "indeed , we can rewrite equation   in a conservative fokker ",
    "planck form [ fp_form ] _ t m = k[d(k)mk - v(k ) m ] + 2 m - 2k^2 m , where @xmath22 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath23 the `` drift velocity '' in @xmath12 space ( @xmath24 implies the spectrum moving towards higher  @xmath12 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath25 satisfies   with  @xmath26 .",
    "+ _ remarks on the validity of the fokker  planck model . _",
    "equation is valid in the limit that the flow velocity has a zero correlation time as given by  , which implies an infinite kinetic - energy density . in order to calculate the relevant parameters of this model for comparison with the more realistic situation where the flow has a finite correlation time",
    ", one may take the following steps . in",
    ", @xmath27 is replaced by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the correlation time of the velocity . doing a calculation parallel to that in  @xcite , one gets [ gamma_d ] = 23_0^kk^2 e(k ) , where @xmath30 is the energy spectrum of the fluid turbulence .",
    "[ for a more refined model , one might allow for the decorrelation rate  @xmath31 to vary with @xmath12 and remain inside the integral in  , or use a three - mode decorrelation rate instead to account for a finite ratio of the velocity and magnetic - field correlation times .",
    "but as long as one uses a value for @xmath29 characteristic of the fastest ( highest-@xmath12 ) eddies , which dominate the integral in  , and @xmath29 does not become large compared to the magnetic - field correlation time , the main scaling is the same . ]",
    "note that the integral in   is proportional to the square of the characteristic eddy - turnover rate  @xmath32 of the flow .",
    "it is clear that , in a fully developed turbulence , @xmath33 , so we may rewrite as [ gamma_d2 ] = [_0^kk^2 e(k)]^1/2 , where @xmath34 is a coefficient of order unity .",
    "the other main assumption in   is that we are focusing on magnetic excitations at  @xmath19 , which raises the question of the appropriate boundary conditions or modifications to the theory at low  @xmath12 .",
    "the effect the large - scale structure of the velocity field may have on the statistics of the small - scale magnetic field is incompletely understood .",
    "however , when the bulk of the magnetic energy is at the subviscous scales , it is probably safe to assume that the spectrum is not significantly affected by the details of what happens at large scales ( see discussion in  @xcite ) . for  @xmath35 , we shall find that  @xmath36 , except perhaps at very large  @xmath37 . in this regime ,",
    "our results are insensitive to the precise form of the boundary condition at small  @xmath12 , and we can simply specify a suitably low boundary @xmath38 across which there is no flux of magnetic energy .    at  @xmath39 , there is no scale separation between the velocity and magnetic field , the local ( in @xmath12  space ) approximation   breaks down , and one must , strictly speaking , use a more general integrodifferential equation for  @xmath40  @xcite , but simplifications may be possible . in the kolmogorov picture of isotropic turbulence , the dominant stretching of eddies at a particular scale",
    "is due to interactions with other eddies at comparable scales .",
    "this suggests that the effect of small - scale velocity fields on larger - scale magnetic fields can be neglected , i.e. , that the `` turbulent diffusivity '' acting on the magnetic field at some @xmath41 is dominated by the contribution from the velocities at the same  @xmath12 . as an approximation",
    ", one would then just continue to use the fokker ",
    "planck equation   but with the expression   for  @xmath14 modified to account for the fact that velocities at a given scale are not very effective in causing net stretching of magnetic fields at larger  scales : [ gamma_k ] ( k ) = [_0^kkk^2 e(k)]^1/2 . for @xmath41 , the dominant contribution to this integral comes from @xmath42 , i.e. , from eddies of sizes comparable to the scale of the field that is being stretched .",
    "note that @xmath43 in   has the same scaling as the @xmath12-dependent eddy - damping rate in the popular phenomenological edqnm closure  @xcite , where setting @xmath44 results in a good fit to the kolmogorov constant  @xcite .",
    "the shearing rate @xmath43 drops to zero for @xmath12 below the forcing wavenumber  @xmath45 of the turbulence , so the `` infrared '' ( ir ) cutoff  @xmath46 just needs to be low enough that @xmath47 [ and thus the flux of magnetic energy in @xmath12  space , the expression in square brackets in equation  ] also vanishes . in the analytic solutions presented below",
    ", we shall neglect any @xmath12  dependence of @xmath14 for simplicity and write the results in terms of a general ir cutoff  @xmath46 .",
    "one could set @xmath48 as a crude model of the argument above , but the precise value of  @xmath46 will not affect any of our results until , where the choice and the meaning of  @xmath46 will be revisited .      let us discuss how a magnetic excitation initially concentrated at some wave numbers  @xmath49 such that  @xmath50 will evolve with time . neglecting the resistive - diffusion term for the time being ( @xmath51 ) , we immediately find the greens - function solution of  : [ m_lognorm ] m(t , k ) = ^(3/4)t_0^m_0(k ) @xmath52 ^ 3/2 1 @xmath53 ^ 2\\over(4/5)\\gka t}$ ] , where @xmath54  is the initial spectrum .",
    "this solution shows that ( i ) the amplitude of each fourier mode grows exponentially in time at the rate  @xmath55 , ( ii ) the number of excited modes [ i.e. , the width of the lognormal envelope in  ] also grows exponentially at the rate @xmath56 , ( iii ) the peak of the excitation originating from each initially present mode  @xmath49 moves towards larger  @xmath12 : @xmath57 $ ] , leaving a power spectrum  @xmath58 behind .",
    "the cumulative effect is the total magnetic - energy growth at the rate  @xmath59 .",
    "the solution   becomes invalid when the magnetic excitation reaches the velocity scale  @xmath60 and/or the resistive scale  @xmath61 . in the former case , including the @xmath12  dependence of  @xmath14 as discussed at the end of would be the minimal adjustment necessary to model large - scale effects . however , the bulk of the magnetic energy is at subviscous scales and is not significantly affected by such modifications .",
    "we shall , therefore , continue to rely on   and ask what happens when the resistive scale is reached .",
    "the asymptotic form of the magnetic - energy spectrum in the resistive regime can be determined by solving an eigenvalue problem .",
    "seeking the solution in the form  @xcite [ m_ev ] m(t , k ) = ^t ( ) , = k/,=(/10)^1/2 , we  get [ bessel_eq ] ^2  - 2 + ( 6 - 5)- ^2= 0 . the solutions of   are bessel functions . demanding that @xmath62 , we  find [ phi_sln ] ( ) = ^3/2",
    "( ) ( ) , ( ) = , where @xmath63  is the macdonald function .",
    "the eigenvalue  @xmath64 must be determined from the boundary condition at small  @xmath12 .",
    "this can be done in several different ways leading to the same result in the asymptotic case  @xmath35 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and the exhaustive reference list in  @xcite ) . here",
    "we choose some finite ir cutoff  @xmath46 and impose a zero - flux boundary condition at  @xmath65 .",
    "this gives [ see equation  ] [ zero_flux ] ()-4 ( ) = 0,=/. substituting   yields the following transcendental equation for  @xmath66 : [ lambda_eq ] k _ ( ) ( ) - 52 k _ ( ) ( ) = @xmath67 = 0,\\qquad   \\imnu(\\lambda)=\\sqrt{5(3/4-\\lambda)}. \\eea thus , in the large-$\\pr$ limit , the zero - flux boundary   condition~\\eref{zero_flux } is equivalent to requiring that the spectrum   should vanish at the ir~cutoff : $ \\phi(\\xiir)=0 $ ( cf.~\\cite{sbk_review } ) .",
    "taking the first ( rightmost ) zero in~\\eref{zero_m } ,   so that \\eref{condn_zeros}~is observed , we find the desired eigenvalue \\bea \\label{lambda_sln } \\lambda \\simeq { 3\\over4 } - { \\pi^2\\over5\\l[\\ln(\\xiir/2)\\r]^2 }   = { 3\\over4 } - \\or\\({1\\over\\ln^2(\\pr^{1/2})}$ ] .    for  @xmath68 , the spectrum is well described by   with  @xmath69 .",
    "thus , in the kinematic regime with diffusion , the magnetic - energy spectrum has a constant profile with a @xmath70 scaling in the range  @xmath71 [ see  ] , and all modes grow exponentially at the same rate  @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the bulk of the magnetic energy is concentrated at the resistive scales  @xmath73 .",
    "when the energy of the magnetic field reaches values such that the back reaction on the flow can not be neglected , the dynamo becomes nonlinear and the velocity  @xmath8 can no longer be considered as given .",
    "it has to be determined self - consistently from the navier  stokes equation : [ ns_eq ] _",
    "t+ = -p + + , where @xmath74  is the fluid viscosity , @xmath75  is some random large - scale forcing , @xmath76  is the pressure determined from the incompressibility condition  @xmath77 , and @xmath76 and @xmath6 have been normalized by @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , @xmath78  being the ( constant ) density of the medium .    from equation  ,",
    "it is evident that the nonlinear regime is characterized by at least partial balancing of the inertial and magnetic - tension terms : @xmath80 . in order to correctly estimate the tension force  @xmath81 ,",
    "it is _ not _ enough to know the energy of the field and its characteristic scale as determined from the isotropic spectra in .",
    "indeed , the gradient in  @xmath81 is locally aligned with the field direction , so one must invoke the geometrical structure of the field lines . as was shown in our earlier studies  @xcite ,",
    "the small - scale fields generated by the kinematic dynamo are organized in folds : the smallness of their characteristic scale is due to rapid spatial - direction reversals , while the field lines remain mostly straight up the scale of the stretching eddy .",
    "it follows that , during the kinematic stage , @xmath82 .",
    "since the inertial term is  @xmath83 , the nonlinearity becomes important when the small - scale magnetic energy equalizes with the energy of the viscous - scale eddies : @xmath84 , or @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "note that if the folded structure of the field had been ignored , then estimating @xmath86 would have led to the incorrect conclusion that nonlinearities become important at the much lower magnetic energies : @xmath87 .",
    "the magnetic back reaction must then act to suppress the random shear flows associated with these eddies .",
    "however , the next - larger - scale eddies still have energies larger than that of the magnetic field , though the turnover rate of these eddies is smaller .",
    "we conjecture that these eddies will continue to amplify the field in the same , essentially kinematic , fashion .",
    "the scale of these eddies is  @xmath88 , the folds are elongated accordingly ( see remark in ) , and the tension force is  @xmath89 . the corresponding inertial term is  @xmath90 , so these eddies become suppressed when  @xmath91 , whereupon it will be the turn of the next - larger eddies to provide the dominant stretching action . at all times , it is the smallest unsuppressed eddy that most rapidly stretches the field .",
    "thus , we define the stretching scale  @xmath92 at a given time  @xmath37  by [ nlin_balance ] w(t)~12u^2_(t ) . in equation  , @xmath13  is now the turnover rate of the eddies of scale  @xmath92 : @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath94 , where @xmath95  is the kolmogorov energy flux .",
    "equation   becomes [ w_eq_eps ] w - 2 ^ 2(t ) w , where @xmath96  is some constant of order unity .",
    "the physical meaning of this equation is as follows .",
    "the turbulent energy injected at the forcing scale cascades hydrodynamically down to the scale  @xmath92 where a finite fraction  @xmath96 of it is diverted into the small - scale magnetic fields .",
    "equation   implies that the magnetic energy should grow linearly with time during this stage : @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , comparing   and  , we get [ gamma_eps ] ( t ) , where @xmath98  is a constant order - one coefficient to be determined in  .",
    "we stress that the field is still organized in folds of characteristic parallel length  @xmath92 with direction reversals perpendicular to  @xmath6 at the resistive scale .",
    "note that the resistive scale now changes with time : a straightforward estimate gives @xmath99^{1/2}\\sim(\\eta t)^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "thus , the resistive cutoff moves to larger scales .",
    "indeed , as the stretching slows down with decreasing  @xmath13 , _ selective decay _ eliminates the modes at the high-@xmath12 end of the spectrum for which the resistive time is now shorter than the stretching time and which , consequently , can not be sustained anymore . in , we shall see that the magnetic - energy spectrum evolves in a self - similar fashion during this stage .",
    "note that some fluid motions do survive at scales below  @xmath92 and down to the viscous cutoff .",
    "these are the motions that do not amplify the magnetic field .",
    "they are waves of alfvnic nature propagating along the folds of direction - reversing magnetic fields ( ) .",
    "a finite fraction of the hydrodynamic energy arriving from the large scales is channelled into the turbulence of these waves ( ) .",
    "since the alfvnic motions are dissipated _ viscously _ , not resistively , we shall assume that they do not have a secular effect on the folded small - scale field , i.e. , that they do not significantly change its scale or energy ( see and further discussion in ) .",
    "the process of scale - by - scale suppression of the stretching motions continues until the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the energy  @xmath100 of the outer - scale eddies ( i.e. , to the energy of the turbulence ) and @xmath101 , the forcing scale .",
    "the time scale for this to happen is easily estimated to be the turnover time of the outer - scale eddies  @xmath102 , where @xmath103  is the velocity of these eddies .",
    "the resistive cutoff scale is now larger than during the kinematic stage : @xmath104 , where by @xmath105 we denote the resistive cutoff in the kinematic regime .",
    "however , this is not a very significant shift : for example , in the interstellar medium , where  @xmath106 , it is by a meager factor of  @xmath107 .",
    "recall that @xmath108 and @xmath109 , so @xmath110 , i.e. , the scale separation between the field - generating motions and the resulting magnetic fields is actually increased .",
    "the magnetic field is still small scale and arranged in folds of length  @xmath111 with direction reversals at the resistive scale .      at this point ,",
    "the hydrodynamic energy stirred up at the forcing scale is transfered directly into the small - scale folded magnetic field ( i.e. , in  , @xmath112 ) . as there are no scales in the system larger than @xmath111 , there can be no further growth of the magnetic energy .",
    "indeed , the tension in the folds is now @xmath113 and the force balance in   requires @xmath114 , so @xmath115 .",
    "note that setting  @xmath116 in   gives @xmath117 .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the resistive cutoff  @xmath118 is now determined by the zero - sum balance between the field amplification ( stretching ) and the resistive dissipation : [ res_balance ] ( t)~^2(t ) .",
    "however , at scales larger than the resistive cutoff , i.e. , for @xmath119 , the field - amplification rate  @xmath120 is larger than the resistive - dissipation rate  @xmath121 ( , right panel ) .",
    "since the total magnetic energy is not allowed to grow anymore , the growth of modes with @xmath119 must be compensated by the decrease in the value of  @xmath122 , i.e. , by further selective decay of the high-@xmath12 modes .",
    "this , in turn , should lead to further decrease of  @xmath120 in accordance with the resistive balance  .",
    "we shall see in that the evolution of the magnetic - energy spectrum in this regime is likely to be self - similar with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "thus , we expect that this last stage of the nonlinear dynamo should be characterized by @xmath120 dropping below the turnover rate  @xmath125 of the outer - scale eddies",
    ". therefore , the rate of the energy transfer into the small - scale magnetic field decreases , as this channel of energy dissipation becomes inefficient .",
    "instead , we expect the energy injected by the forcing to be increasingly diverted into the alfvnic turbulence that is left throughout the inertial range in the wake of the suppression of the stretching motions .",
    "we saw in the preceding sections that @xmath122 decreases both in the nonlinear - growth stage and during the subsequent slower approach to saturation .",
    "it is very important to understand how far the decrease of  @xmath122 can proceed .",
    "we recall that , in our arguments so far , we have disregarded the alfvnic component of the turbulence .",
    "it is not , however , justified to do so _ after _ the small - scale magnetic energy reaches the velocity scales .",
    "indeed , the decrease of  @xmath126 is basically a consequence of the balance between the field - amplification and the resistive - dissipation terms in the energy equation  : as @xmath13 drops , so does  @xmath127 ; once the characteristic scale of the small - scale fields reaches the viscous scale  @xmath60 , the alfvnic turbulence will start to affect  @xmath128 in an essential way : since the waves are damped at the viscous scale , @xmath128  must stabilize at @xmath129 .",
    "the resulting turbulent state features folded magnetic fields reversing directions at the viscous scale plus alfvn waves in the inertial range propagating along the folds .",
    "there are then two possibilities : either ( i )  this represents the final steady state of the isotropic mhd turbulence , or ( ii )  further evolution will lead to unwinding of the folds and continued energy transfer to larger scales , so that the spectrum will eventually peak at the outer scale and have an alfvnic power tail extending through the inertial range .",
    "the turbulence in the inertial range would in the latter case be of the usual alfvn - wave kind  @xcite , where the large - scale magnetic fluctuations provide a mean field along which the inertial - range alfvn waves propagate .",
    "a generic mhd turbulent steady state would thus emerge at the end of the nonlinear - dynamo evolution .",
    "this dichotomy can not be resolved at the level of the present model and requires further study .",
    "however , in either case , @xmath129 , so the statistical steady state of the fully developed isotropic mhd turbulence is characterized by the equalization of the resistive and viscous scales .",
    "the time scale at which such an equalization is brought about is the resistive time associated with the viscous scale of the turbulence :  @xmath130 .",
    "we immediately notice that , in order for the slow approach to saturation described in to be realizable , this time scale must be longer than the turnover time of the outer - scale eddies : @xmath131 , which requires  @xmath132 . in other words ,",
    "the resistive scale at the end of the nonlinear - growth stage must still be smaller than the viscous scale : @xmath133 .",
    "this constitutes the `` true large-@xmath5 regime , '' which is the one relevant for astrophysical plasmas ( thus , in the interstellar medium , @xmath106 , @xmath134 ) . in this regime , the magnetic energy saturates at the equipartition level , @xmath135 . from the energy balance",
    ", we get an estimate of the amount of turbulent power that is still dissipated resistively : @xmath136 .",

    "t t , ^-1 t ^-1 ~^-1 ^ 1/2~. comparing the above asymptotic with equation  , we note that @xmath166  can be interpreted as the fraction of the turbulent power received by the magnetic fields that actually contributes to the growth of their energy .",
    "the rest is dissipated resistively .",
    "the upper time limit  @xmath167 for this regime is the turnover time of the outer - scale eddies .    in order to determine the value of  @xmath98",

    "it is now necessary to implement the boundary condition at small  @xmath12 .",
    "again , we should like to pick some finite ir cutoff  @xmath46 and to impose the zero - flux condition   ( see discussion in on the choice of  @xmath46 ) .",
    "however , strictly speaking , introducing the new dimensional parameter  @xmath46 breaks the self - similarity of the problem : instead of  , we must now write [ m_nonssim ] m(t , k ) = w(t)(t)(,),_^(,)=1 , where @xmath171 is a new _ time - dependent _ dimensionless variable . since the non - self - similar solution   has a self - similar asymptotic when @xmath172 , we can still use  , provided  @xmath173 .",

    "included , the growth of the magnetic field is offset by resistive diffusion . as we showed above",
    ", this lowers the net amplification rate of the magnetic energy to @xmath194 in the first self - similar regime .",
    "however , the length of the field line continues to grow at the rate  @xmath13 , so @xmath195 .",
    "using the nonlinear balance   and kolmogorov scaling for velocity gives @xmath196 . by itself",
    ", this would indicate that @xmath191 grows even faster than  @xmath197 .",
    "however , a straight section of a field line remains straight during stretching only as long as it is still short compared to the stretching - eddy size .",
    "once @xmath191 grows to be comparable to  @xmath197 , it is limited to  @xmath198 by the curvature in the stretching eddies .",
    "the conclusion from this argument is that the length of the folds can quickly adjust to the changing stretching scale .",
    "note that this conclusion does not depend on the precise value of  @xmath98 : it is sufficient that  @xmath199 .",
    "thus , after time  @xmath187 , the energy of the small - scale magnetic fields is very close to the equipartition energy  @xmath100 .",
    "we observe that in this regime it is still possible to have a self - similar solution in the form  : the energy is now ( nearly ) constant , so  @xmath200 in  .",
    "accordingly , substituting   into  , we find [ w_second ] w(t ) [1-^22@xmath201 ^ 2 ] , t = ^-1 ~^-1 ^ 1/2 .",
    "we now set  @xmath200 in   and proceed to solve the resulting eigenvalue problem in exactly the same way as we did in .",
    "all the same formulae and considerations apply , except that the expressions for  @xmath202 in   and for  @xmath203 in   are now as follows : = 2@xmath204,()5 ^ 3/42 ^ -1/4@xmath180 ^ 1/2 .",

    ", the spectrum is given by   with  @xmath183 and @xmath205 .",
    "thus , in the second self - similar stage , the magnetic energy is nearly constant , but the resistive cutoff @xmath126 continues to decrease as  @xmath185 , so the magnetic energy is redistributed from small to larger scales ( see figures  [ fig_ssim ] ,  [ fig_mk ] ) .",
    "this is a very slow process , but it can , in principle , go on for a very long time : until self - similarity is broken at @xmath206 . note that , according to  , the magnetic energy changes sufficiently slowly to make the left - hand side of the energy equation   subdominant in comparison with the field - amplification and resistive - dissipation terms in the right - hand side .",
    "this is consistent with the physical argument of .",
    "the self - similar solutions obtained above break down after a finite time  @xmath207 due to the presence of the finite ir cutoff  @xmath46 . once the resistive cutoff  @xmath122 becomes comparable to  @xmath46 , the system arrives at the final steady state .",
    "the validity of this state is questionable since our model was derived under the assumption that the magnetic fields were at smaller scales than the velocity field , i.e.  @xmath208 .",
    "furthermore , the specifications of the steady - state solution that the model yields clearly will have an order - one dependence on the value of the ir cutoff  @xmath46 , on the type of the boundary condition imposed , and on the form of the expression  .",

    "^ 2]^-1/2 - ^-1/2 .",
    "what is the correct choice of  @xmath46 ?",
    "of course , as long as the characteristic scale of the field is much smaller than that of all fluid motions , stretching or alfvnic , i.e. , @xmath208 , the precise value of  @xmath46 does not affect the self - similar asymptotics of in the leading order . what @xmath46 represents is the presence in the problem of a spatial scale which leads to the breakdown of self - similarity in the long run ( after time  @xmath222 ) . as we explained in ,",
    "once the resistive and the viscous scales become comparable , the evolution of the small - scale fields can not be separated from that of the inertial - range alfvnic turbulence .",
    "clearly , beyond this point , the evolution of the spectrum is not described by the self - similar solutions obtained in .",
    "if we set  @xmath223 , the end of the self - similar regime and the stabilization of  @xmath122 at a value  @xmath224 are reflected by the steady - state solution of our fokker  planck model .",
    "note that , with this choice of  @xmath46 , equation   correctly reproduces both @xmath225 for  @xmath132 and the physical estimate   of the subequipartition saturation level for  @xmath226 .",
    "we stress that , since the validity of the fokker ",
    "planck model itself breaks down together with the self - similarity , the specific functional form of its steady - state solution can not be expected to have predictive value .",
    "the ensuing regime is controlled by the interaction between the folded fields and the alfvn waves and is left for future study .",
    "we have presented a physical scenario of the evolution of the nonlinear large-@xmath5 dynamo according to which a magnetic - energy spectrum concentrated at velocity scales does emerge , but the time scale for it is resistive , not dynamical : the resistive scale approaches the viscous scale after  @xmath227 . in the interstellar medium ,",
    "the spitzer  @xcite value of the magnetic diffusivity is  @xmath228 , @xmath229  @xcite , so @xmath230  years , which exceeds the age of the universe by 7  orders of magnitude ! the conclusion is that this mechanism can not be invoked as a workable feature of the galactic dynamo  at least not if the dissipation of the magnetic field is controlled by the spitzer magnetic diffusivity .    the statistically steady solutions discussed in represent the possible long - time asymptotic states of the fully developed isotropic large-@xmath5 mhd turbulence .",
    "since the approach to these states is controlled by the resistive time scale associated with the velocity spatial scales , they have practically no relevance for astrophysical plasmas , which have large  @xmath231 and huge  @xmath5 . studying these states may",
    ", therefore , appear to be a purely academic exercise in fundamental turbulence theory .",
    "while the importance of such pursuits ought never to be underestimated , we should like to point out another , more practical angle from which our results could be viewed .",
    "the enormous scale separations so often encountered in astrophysical objects are not accessible in the turbulence simulations that constitute the state of the art on earth , so one usually has to be satisfied with only very modest @xmath231 and  @xmath5 .",
    "most of the numerical studies of the small - scale dynamo have so far adopted the strategy of resolving a reasonable hydrodynamic inertial range while only allowing for prandtl numbers of at most order  10  @xcite . in this context , our steady - state solution and formula   point to an important possibility .",
    "when the scale separations in the problem are not very large , the system may converge to a steady state with a subequipartition magnetic energy @xmath232 .",
    "subequipartion saturated states have indeed been reported in the numerical experiments cited above .",
    "since the condition for the true asymptotic regime is @xmath132 ( ) , numerical experiments with very high resolution are required to adequately study the large-@xmath5 mhd turbulence .",
    "in conclusion , we list some of the unresolved issues that require further study .    *",
    "the detailed mechanism of the flow suppression by the small - scale magnetic fields is a long - standing physical problem  @xcite . in our model",
    ", we have conjectured the suppression of the shearing flows but allowed for oscillatory alfvnic motions , that do not stretch the field ( ) . strictly speaking",
    ", only the parallel component of the shear tensor  @xmath233 must be suppressed in order to block the growth of the magnetic energy .",
    "the perpendicular components , if unaffected , could perhaps mix the field ( without amplifying it ) via a quasi - two - dimensional field - line - interchange mechanism and thus prevent any increase in the field s characteristic scale .",
    "in fact , this seems to be the physics behind the recent numerical results on the large-@xmath5 mhd turbulence _ with a fixed uniform mean field _",
    "however , it is unclear to what extent such motions can remain quasi - two - dimensional and avoid twisting up the magnetic field , which would then resist further mixing  particularly , in our case of a folded field - line structure without an externally imposed mean field .",
    "* our physical picture of the final approach to saturation ( ) is not based on a solid phenomenological argument such as that for the nonlinear - growth stage , and remains incompletely understood .",
    "indeed , it remains to be proven definitively that the selective decay will continue after the small - scale magnetic energy reaches the energy of the outer - scale eddies . due to resolution constraints discussed above ,",
    "no numerical evidence of this regime is available as yet . *",
    "two possibilities for the long - time behaviour of the isotropic mhd turbulence were identified in : saturation in the generic alfvnic mhd turbulent state and saturation in a state where a significant amount of the magnetic energy remains tied up in the viscous - scale fields .",
    "which one is realized depends on the way the small - scale folded fields interact with the inertial - range alfvn - wave turbulence .",
    "we should like to observe that there is no numerical evidence available at present that would confirm that , the isotropic forced mhd turbulence _ without externally imposed mean field _  at any prandtl number  attains the alfvnic state of scale - by - scale equipartition envisioned in iroshnikov ",
    "kraichnan  @xcite or goldreich ",
    "sridhar  @xcite phenomenologies .",
    "in fact , medium - resolution numerical investigations  @xcite rather seem to support the final states with small - scale energy concentration even for  @xmath234 .",
    "this does not mean that the alfvnic picture is incorrect _ per se_.",
    "however , all existing phenomenologies of the alfvnic turbulence depend on kraichnan s  @xcite assumption that the most energetic magnetic fields are those at the outer scale .",
    "this is automatically satisfied if a finite mean field is imposed externally  @xcite .",
    "however , it remains to be seen if such a distribution of energy is set up self - consistently when the turbulence is isotropic .",
    "the alternative identified here involves alfvnic motions superimposed on small - scale folded fields . *",
    "an extension of the mhd description itself that may change the properties of the small - scale magnetic turbulence is the incorporation of the braginskii  @xcite tensor viscosity  @xcite . even at magnetic energies small enough for the kinematic approximation to hold",
    ", the plasma is already well magnetized and the anisotropy of the viscous stress tensor leads to suppression of the velocity diffusion perpendicular to the local magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy is all the more important in view of the locally anisotropic ( folding ) structure of the magnetic field itself  @xcite .",
    "* another important extension is to allow compressible motions .",
    "the interstellar turbulence is sonic at the outer ( supernova ) scale but becomes subsonic and predominantly vortical in the inertial range ( cf .",
    "this is the commonly accepted justification for the use of incompressible mhd in the models of galactic dynamo .",
    "of course , a certain amount of compressive motion is always present in the interstellar medium ( as well as in other astrophysical plasmas ) , and it has been suggested in the literature that the compressibility of the motions and interactions between alfvn waves and density inhomogeneities can be important in the description of turbulence ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and many recent references cited therein ) .",
    "the treatment of the kinematic - dynamo problem for a model compressible case can be found in  @xcite .",
    "however , it remains to be understood whether and how weak compressibility affects the basic properties of the nonlinear dynamo .",
