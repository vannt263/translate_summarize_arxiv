    "<S> we report measurements of dynamical tunneling rates of a bose - einstein condensate across a barrier in classical phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms are initially prepared in quantum states which extend over a classically regular island region . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the specific system of quantum accelerator modes of the kicked rotor in the presence of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental data is supported by numerical simulations taking into account imperfections mainly from spontaneous emission . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we predict experimentally accessible parameter ranges over which direct tunneling could be readily observed if spontaneous emission was further suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , we provide a proof - of - principle for the experimental accessibility of dynamical tunneling rates in periodically driven systems .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the first manifestations of quantum mechanics was radioactive decay , in which  according to gamov s theory  </S>",
    "<S> a particle can overcome a static potential barrier because of an even exponentially small tail of its spatial wave function at the unbounded side of the barrier @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides this static problem of over - the - barrier tunneling , dynamical tunneling mechanisms are also well known today @xcite . in classical dynamical systems , </S>",
    "<S> the phase space is generally mixed , with regions of regular and chaotic motion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though dynamical barriers forbid the classical transport between these regions , a quantum particle can tunnel by leaking through classically invariant curves .    </S>",
    "<S> dynamical or chaos - assisted tunneling has been subject of many theoretical works over the last years @xcite , which , in particular , use tools of semiclassics to make approximate predictions about the quantum mechanical tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> experiments to observe even signatures of the tunneling of states initially prepared within classically regular regions into the chaotic surrounding , are notoriously hard @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulties are very natural since it is hard to control the effective planck s constant @xmath0 over a wide range . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 determines the size of the quantum state with respect to phase space . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 is large ( see in particular @xcite ) , tunneling occurs fast , but one is far from the semiclassical limit which many fascinating theories exploit @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath0 is small , tunneling simply would take too long to be measured precisely .    to balance this tradeoff </S>",
    "<S> we show the experimental realization of a paradigmatic system @xcite which not only provides access to a wide range of @xmath0 , but also allows for precise control of the initial state and the dynamical evolution . the theoretical description of our system and predictions on the resonance - assisted tunneling ( rat ) mechanism can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show a proof of principle observation of dynamical tunneling experimentally , backed up by numerical simulations which also include the effect of experimental imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we check the scaling of the direct tunneling @xcite ( i.e. not based on more complicated processes such as rat ) rates with the ratio of the area and the effective planck s constant . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions may be tested in future experiments once we overcome the main imperfection arising from spontaneous emission .    in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we prepare a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of about 40000 @xmath1rb atoms in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 level using an all - optical trap . </S>",
    "<S> after release from the trap , the bec is exposed to kicks with period @xmath4 from a standing wave formed by two laser beams of wavelength @xmath5 780 nm , detuned @xmath6ghz to the red of the atomic transition . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of these kicks is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the rabi frequency of the transition and @xmath9 is the duration of a pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of a spontaneous emission event per atom during a kick can be calculated from @xmath10 , where the lifetime of the atomic state is @xmath11ns . to control the phase , intensity , and pulse length as well as the relative frequency between the kicking beams </S>",
    "<S> , each laser beam passes through an acousto - optic modulator driven by a waveform generator . </S>",
    "<S> adding two counterpropagating waves differing in frequency by @xmath12 results in a standing wave that moves with a velocity @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this fequency shift is used to accelerate the lattice corresponding to an effective gravity field with dimensionless acceleration parameter @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the grating vector of the kicking lattice and @xmath16 the atomic mass . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the quasi - momentum of the bec relative to the standing wave is proportional to @xmath17 , which is used to prepare the initial state within the relevant phase space region in momentum . in dimenionless units ( see @xcite ) , momentum is decomposed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 is quasi - momentum and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the bec is sufficiently dilute such that we can exclude interatomic interaction effects .    in this way we realize quantum accelerator modes as done previously in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these modes correspond to classically stable resonance islands embedded in a chaotic surrounding . </S>",
    "<S> they are perfect for our purpose since the modes move with constant speed in momentum space , while the chaotic part essentially remains behind @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , dynamical tunneling from the islands to the surroundings is not hindered by backflow into the island .     taken @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state of the condensate ( dashed green region ) extends over the mid - point of the classical island ( red ) . the effective planck cell with @xmath23 is shown by the ( blue ) shaded rectangle . for the given parameters , @xmath24 , more than half of the initial state follows the island motion and contributes to the tunneling signal . </S>",
    "<S> ]    the dynamics of our kicked atom accelerator is described by the following hamiltonian in the accelerated frame and in dimensionless units @xcite : @xmath25 here @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the angular momentum operator , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the kicking strength and period . with periods close to @xmath30 , or @xmath4 close to the half - talbot time @xmath31 , the evolution of our quantum system is approximately dscribed by the following pseudo - classical map @xcite @xmath32 here @xmath33 and the classical momentum @xmath34 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we review such details since , by the latter formula , it is clear how control on the quantum numbers @xmath35 and @xmath19 allows us to prepare the initial state with a maximal overlap with the classical stable regions @xcite , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . in our experiments </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath35 is chosen zero and the @xmath19 values obey approximately a gaussian distribution with fwhm 0.06 centred at @xmath36 .    , its population is simply measured by counting the number of atoms in it . </S>",
    "<S> lower panel : extracted survival probability vs. kick number ( solid line ) and exponential fit ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> parameters are the same as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . ]    </S>",
    "<S> our main observables are momentum distributions as a function of the number of standing wave pulses applied to the bec . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:2 ] ( upper panel ) shows such a distribution for characteristic system parameters . in the lower panel </S>",
    "<S> we plot the relative amount of population in the mode vs. the kick counter . from this survival probability ( to stay within the mode or within the classical resonance island ) </S>",
    "<S> we extract the decay rates by exponential fits . </S>",
    "<S> these rates are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] together with decay rates extracted from numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the experimental rates are systematically larger than the ideal numerical ones . </S>",
    "<S> hence we run simulations also including random events of spontaneous emission occurring with a probability of @xmath37 per single kick and per atom . within the experimental error bars , </S>",
    "<S> we then obtain reasonable agreement with the experimental data </S>",
    "<S> . one notable feature of the experimental data is that there is a distinct reduction in the decay rate as area increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly the opposite of the behavior expected if our decay rates are primarily due to se since @xmath28 and hence @xmath38 increase in this situation . </S>",
    "<S> while there is also the possibility of other types of noise such as vibrations of the lattice , this only becomes significant as the duration ( i.e. number of kicks ) of the experiment is extended . </S>",
    "<S> it is for this reason that we could only measure up to a relatively small number of kicks of about @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the temporal range to extract the experimental rates is rather small .     and from numerical simulation for long times without any imperfections ( red squares ) and with spontaneous emission ( blue crosses ) . </S>",
    "<S> parameters are the same as in the previous figures but with @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the experimental points . </S>",
    "<S> the global scaling with the area divided by planck s constant @xmath42 has a prefactor in the exponent of @xmath43 ( see fit by red dashed line ) as compared to the theoretical value @xmath44 for direct tunneling @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the dot - dashed line presents a fit to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> there the slope is smaller , @xmath46 , originating from spontaneous emission which leads to the saturation of the curve with increasing @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of a negative slope is strongly suggestive that dynamical tunneling is playing an important role in these decay rates . ]    </S>",
    "<S> please note that we plotted the rates in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] as a function of the area @xmath47 of the resonance island shown , e.g. , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these areas are divided by the effective planck s constant @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we computed the areas for different parameter sets by propagating a single classical trajectory in the chaotic region for many kicks , see appendix b in @xcite for details . a semiclassical theory for direct tunneling ( i.e. without resolving additional small - scale structures within the island ) would predict a scaling @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the ideal numerical simulations show a slightly smaller slope of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations are done for ensembles of @xmath51 @xmath19-rotors with a gaussian distribution of the @xmath19 values as specified above . </S>",
    "<S> the decay rates of the accelator modes ( red squares in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] ) are extracted from summing up the contribution of five to ten momentum states in the modes ( as seen in the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ) as a function of time for up to a maximum of @xmath52 kicks . since the corresponding computations with spontaneous emission take a long time we restrict to just a few data points , shown by the blue crosses , in this case .    in figure  [ fig:3 ] , </S>",
    "<S> we observe clear deviations from the scaling @xmath49 for the experimental data arising from the saturation of the curve with increasing kick strength @xmath28 or increasing @xmath42 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to spontaneous emission which scales linear in @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath53 . in consequence , </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous emission really hinders us to observe the expected scaling for the direct tunneling rates . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless as noted previously , the experimental decay rate does decrease with area , which strongly suggests that dynamical tunneling is playing an important role . </S>",
    "<S> thus even though there are limitations to our experimental study , it can still be seen as a demonstration of the proof - of - principle for the observation of dynamical tunneling in periodically kicked systems with classical mixed phase space .    to further check the semiclassical prediction for the direct tunneling process from the island into the chaotic sea , i.e. without any complications due to rat or other more elaborated processes , we searched for realistic parameter sets summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] . in ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> we kept the kicking period @xmath54 fixed and chose tuples of @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as indicated in the figure . in ( b ) we kept fixed the classical phase space structure determined solely by the two parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we observe an overall scaling with @xmath49 , while @xmath47 remains constant in ( b ) in contrast to ( a ) . in our imaging system , we can not use higher @xmath60 and @xmath28 because the momentum distribution is not observable after a larger kick number . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , already with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the momentum distribution beyond 65 kicks can not be observed ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ( upper panel ) ) .     and the shown tuples of @xmath55 vs. the area @xmath47 of the resonance island of the modes over planck s constant @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) tunneling rates for fixed @xmath47 ( fixed classical phase space structure ) with @xmath59 changing @xmath28 and @xmath48 accordingly such that @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines present exponential fits with prefactors in the exponents @xmath64 in ( a ) and @xmath65 in ( b ) . ]    despite the experimental imperfections hindering us from measuring small tunneling rates precisely , the fact that the decay rate decreases with larger amounts of spontaneous emission shows that we have a proof - of - principle for the detection of dynamical tunneling in a periodically kicked bose - einstein condensate . if it were possible to reduce the spontaneous emission below @xmath66 , the tunneling rates in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](a ) which lie in the range @xmath67 ( inside the dashed box ) , should be experimentally measurable with our setup . </S>",
    "<S> this could be achieved with the help of a laser with a larger detuning from the atomic transition and a correspondingly higher intensity ( to maintain the potential strength we currently have ) . </S>",
    "<S> detecting more structure in the rates , e.g. arising from rat @xcite , is a harder task with an atom - optics setup . </S>",
    "<S> one possible solution might be to realize accelerator modes in an optical system where experiments can be carried out up to a few thousand kicks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would allow for better measurements of dynamical tunneling over a much larger range of the effective planck s constant @xmath48 . </S>"
