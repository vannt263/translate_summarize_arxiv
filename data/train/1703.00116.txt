    "photons are important probes of the system produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhics ) , offering an useful way to investigate the pre - equilibrium stage , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and the hadronic phase . as a matter of fact ,",
    "photons are emitted during the whole lifetime of the system produced by the collisions , and because their mean free path is much larger than the collision volume , they leave the system undisturbed . for this reason it is often said that they bring to the detectors the informations about the particular state that has produced them .",
    "photon production in rhics has been studied extensively within recent years , see @xcite and references therein .    in the lifetime of the fireball produced in rhics it is possible to distinguish among direct photons , namely those arising from collision processes , and decay photons that are instead produced by hadron decays .",
    "direct photons are then mainly split into prompt photons , produced by primordial scatterings among the nucleons , and thermal photons , that instead are produced by a thermalized qgp and hadron gas . both thermal and prompt photons have been already intensively studied . on the other hand ,",
    "the understanding of the photon emission in the early non - equilibrium stage of hics is still not complete , since a very small amount of work has been devoted to this subject @xcite .",
    "we aim to fill this gap here , by presenting results about photon production considering pre - equilibrium photons on the same footing of themal photons .",
    "our main theoretical scheme consists of relativistic transport theory coupled to the dynamics of a classical color field that corresponds to the initial gluon - dominated stage , and eventually evolves to qgp .",
    "this theoretical model has been used to study the evolution of the early stage of rhics @xcite giving a picture that agrees qualitatively , and to some extent also quantitatively , with the one obtained by means of classical yang - mills calculations for what concerns the evolution of the pressures in the system @xcite .",
    "although the initial state is represented by a classical field that mimics the glasma @xcite , the decay of the field produces quickly quarks and gluons that scatter and create photons even when the system is not a thermalized qgp .",
    "we implement photons production by means of a collision integral , therefore we do not follow the common strategy used in previous calculations in which one has to assume local thermalization and integrate the rates over the spacetime volume of the fireball .",
    "this is the advantage of using relativistic transport theory , which allows us to study photons production also in the early stages where hydrodynamics can not be properly ( or judiciously ) applied .",
    "nonetheless , we will see that in thermal qgp phase the two approaches gives nearly identical results .    with respect to previous calculations based on transport",
    "theory @xcite , the main novelty that we bring by our study is the clear identification of the contribution of the early stage of rhics to the direct photon spectrum , looking for both the relative abundance of the photons produced and the momentum region of the photon spectrum that takes the main contribution from the early stage .",
    "we will find that the early stage is quite efficient in producing photons , therefore our results support the absence of a dark age in rhics .",
    "photons from a thermalizing early stage have been also studied very recently in @xcite , where the bottom - up thermalization scenario of @xcite has been adopted ; classical - statistical simulations have shown that bottom - up is the right thermalization scenario @xcite and it extrapolates to finite couplings quite well @xcite .",
    "our results agree with the importance of the early stage photons production in rhics already highlighted in @xcite ; with respect to @xcite , our main novelty is to implement photon production by a code based on relativistic transport theory and set up to follow the dynamical evolution of the system produced in rhics , from the early stage up to the freezout , thus allowing a more direct link to the observables of rhics . in the bottom - up scenario , bose - einstein enhancement factors in the collision",
    "integral are potentially important due to large gluon occupation numbers in the initial stage ; these have been considered in @xcite , while for simplicity we have not included them in our calculations although within transport theory they can be implemented @xcite , leaving their inclusion to future works .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the abelian flux tube model that we use for the initial condition , as well as our implementation of transport theory and the photon rate that we implement in the collision integral . in section iii",
    "we summarize our main results on the photon spectrum and photon abundancy . finally in section iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this subection , we summarize the abelian flux tube model ( aftm ) , that we use to define an initial condition in our simulations based on classical gluon fields , as well as the base for the evolution of this field configuration to qgp , see @xcite for details .",
    "the main idea of the aftm is to replace the glasma with a simpler initial classical color field configuration , in which one considers , in its simplest realization , only the electric part of the color field , which decays into qgp by means of the schwinger mechanism ; the pair creation that occurs locally changes the local dipole moment of the system , creating a displacement current whose backreaction on the evolution of the field is taken into account properly ( see below ) . besides , it is assumed that the classical field equations are abelian , namely the covariant derivatives in the qcd field equations are replaced by ordinary derivatives .",
    "we would like to observe , however , that even if the model is named abelian , such nomenclature simply refers to the fact that in the evolution equation for the classical field , self - interacion terms coming from non vanishing structure constants of the color gauge group are neglected @xcite .",
    "however interactions among the classical field and gluons are still present in this calculations , thanks both to the schwinger effect which produces charged gluons , and to conduction currents which affect the evolution of the field , see the next section for more details .    in this work",
    ", we assume that the initial color electric field is longitudinal , while transverse components of the field develop due to transverse color currents .",
    "assuming massless quanta , the number of pairs per unit of spacetime and invariant momentum space produced by the decay of the electric field by the schwinger effect is  @xcite @xmath1 with @xmath2 the plus ( minus ) sign corresponding to the creation of a boson ( fermion - antifermion ) pair . in this equation @xmath3 , @xmath4 refer to each of the two particles created by the tunneling process ; @xmath5 is the effective force which acts on the tunneling pair and it depends on color and flavor ; it can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for the magnitude of the color field , @xmath8 denotes the string tension depending on the kind of flavor considered .",

    "we solve numerically eq .   using the test particles method and the collision integral is computed using monte carlo methods based on the stochastic interpretation of transition amplitude @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the electric color field is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 corresponds to the color charge density , @xmath33 with @xmath34 standing for flavor and color respectively ; the sum in the above equation runs over quarks , antiquarks and gluons . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath35 corresponds to the color electric current which is given by the sum of two contributions , that is @xmath36 here @xmath37 is a colored generalization of the usual electric current density which in a continuum notation is given by @xmath38 the term @xmath39 is called the displacement current , arising from the change in time of the dipole moment of the medium induced by pairs pop - up via the schwinger mechanism , in the same way a time variation of the local dipole moment in a medium gives rise to a change in the local electric field  @xcite .",
    "we can write  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 corresponds to the number of flavors in the calculation .",
    "the color charge and current densities depend on the particle distribution function : hence they link the field equations   to the kinetic equation  .",
    "we solve self - consistently the field and kinetic equations , taking into account the back reaction of particle production and propagation on the color field .    at variance with the standard use of transport theory , in which one fixes a set of microscopic processes into the collision integral , we have developed an approach that fixes the total cross section in order to have the wanted @xmath42 of the system . by means of this scheme",
    "we are able to use the boltzmann equation to simulate the dynamical evolution of a fluid with specified shear viscosity , in analogy to what is done within hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "we use the chapman - enskog @xcite approach to relate shear viscosity to temperature , cross section and density which is in agreement with green - kubo correlator results @xcite .",
    "therefore , we fix @xmath42 and compute the pertinent total cross section by mean of the relation @xmath43 which is valid for a generic differential cross section @xmath44 as proved in  @xcite . in the above equation @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the screening mass regulating the angular dependence of the cross section , while @xmath47\\ !",

    "the @xmath52 is the proper function accounting for the correct relaxation time @xmath53 associated to the shear viscosity transport coefficient . for isotropic cross section , i. e. @xmath54 ,",
    "the function @xmath52 is equal to @xmath55 and eq.([eq : sigmatt ] ) reduces to the relaxation time approximation with @xmath56 , while for finite value of @xmath46 , which means anisotropic scatterings , @xmath57 .",
    "we notice that , in the regime where viscous hydrodynamics applies , the specific microscopic details of the cross section are irrelevant , and our approach is an effective way to employ transport theory to simulate a fluid at a given @xmath42 .       + * ( a ) *  * ( b ) *    in this study , we implement photon production by adding the @xmath58 standard processes of compton scattering and quark - antiquark annihilation in the collision integral , see fig .",
    "[ fig : a1 ] .",
    "the differential cross sections for the processes are given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 represent the standart mandelstam variables .",
    "in these equations @xmath61 corresponds to the strong coupling , that we take running according to the one - loop qcd @xmath62function , the sliding scale being the local temperature of the fluid .",
    "the photon production rate that would result by considering only the processes in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1 ] has been computed in @xcite ; however , it is well known that the infrared enhancement of @xmath63 processes is important and makes these processes as important as the @xmath58 ones , although these processes would appear to be suppressed by a naive coupling power counting @xcite .",
    "the @xmath63 processes lead to an increase of the scattering rate with respect to the one obtained considering the @xmath58 processes only : in order to take into account this fact , at the same time avoiding the difficult implementation of the radiative processes in the collision integral , we follow a very simple strategy , namely we multiply the differential cross sections in eqs .   and   by a temperature dependent overall factor that allows us to reproduce the arnold - moore - yaffe ( amy ) production rate @xcite at a given temperature .",
    "within this implementation , we are sure that whenever the cell of the fluid is in local equilibrium at a temperature @xmath64 , the photon spectrum produced by that cell in our code is in fair agreement with the one implemented in calculations based on hydro . therefore what we implement in the collision integral are the following cross sections : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is fixed by hand at the effective local temperature , @xmath67 , in order to reproduce the amy rate , see below ; here @xmath7 is the energy of a given cell and @xmath68 denotes the total number of particles in that cell .",
    "the effective local temperature coincides with the actual temperature when the system is in local equilibrium ; on the other hand , when the system is out of equilibrium , we assume that the cross sections are still given by eqs .   and  , and @xmath69 is computed at the scale @xmath67 .",
    "we notice that for large values of the effective temperature @xmath70 which means that for such large values of the energy density , of the order of those expected in the initial stage , the cross sections implemented in the collision integral are unaffected by this function , and the latter can be considered just as an tool to reproduce the amy rate when the system is in the equilibrated qgp phase .",
    "the multiplicative function @xmath69 does not depend on momenta : as we will show below , this simple choice is enough to obtain a photon production rate that is in fair agreement with amy in a quite broad range of temperature and photon momentum . a plot of @xmath66 is shown in fig .",

    "what we do is to implement photon production in the collision integral , by means of the microscopic cross sections in eqs .   and  .",
    "in this way , we can follow photon production consistently since the very first moments after the collision , namely as soon as the classical color fields decay and produce quarks and gluons , regardless of the fact that the system is in local equilibrium or not .",

    "we find that our procedure , although rough , reproduces the amy rates fairly well in the temperature range that is relevant for the rhics .",
    "in this subsection we discuss how we set up the initial classical field . we assume a longitudinal direction boost invariant chromo - electric field at the initial time , and with a smooth profile in the transverse plane that mimics a standard glauber - type distribution , namely @xmath72 , \\label{eq:45}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 , @xmath74 denotes the transverse plane coordinate and @xmath75 correspond to the density of binary collisions and participants in the transverse plane respectively , both being normalized to one . in eq .",
    "two free parameters appear , namely the peak value of the magnitude of the electric field @xmath76 and the relative abundance of binary and participant collisions @xmath77 .",
    "these parameters are fixed in order to match a standard glauber initialization : in particular , for collisions at rhic energy we impose that at @xmath78 , corresponding to a standard initialization time for calculations with the glauber model , the eccentricity of the system within the aftm is equal to the eccentricity obtained within the glauber model with the same impact parameter , and we require that the total number of particles produced by the two inizializations are the same ; for collisions at lhc energy we perform the same tuning , by requiring that the eccentricity and the total multiplicity in the two initializations coincide at @xmath79 .",
    "numerical values of the parameters used in the calculations are in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we decide to implement these constraints on our initial condition because in this way the main differences that we find in the photon spectrum can be related directly to the presence of the pre - equilibrium evolution in the aftm that instead is absent in the calculations with the glauber initialization .    .",

    "finally , the thick red dot - dashed lines correspond to quark+antiquark number in glauber , while we use the red diamonds to denote the same quantity for the aftm . for the glauber calculations we fix the ratio of quark+antiquark over gluon numbers by its value at chemical equilibrium , that for massless particles is independent on temperature and depends only on the degrees of freedom .",
    "the total particle numbers in aftm and glauber are the same by construction , while the relative abundance of quarks over gluons within the aftm is not fixed a priori but it is a result of the dynamical evolution of the system from the classical gluon field to the qgp via the schwinger effect .",

    "we start by noticing that the total number of photons in the case of the aftm is larger than the one obtained within the glauber model .",
    "this is easy to understand : as a matter of fact , photons in the aftm are produced as soon as quarks and gluons appear by the decay of the initial classical color field , while in the glauber calculation this production is delayed up to the initialization time , the latter being usually assumed as the time necessary for the system to reach a local equilibrium in the transverse plane . integrating the photon spectrum over transverse momentum and rapidity",
    ", we find that for the collisions at rhic the photon abundancy in the aftm is approximately @xmath86 higher than that obtained within the glauber model .",
    "this difference , coming from the existence of a dynamics in the pre - equilibrium stage in the aftm , shows that pre - equilibrium photons are important as they give a substantial contribution to the total number of photons produced by the qgp .",
    "stated in other terms , the early stage is quite bright .",
    "we have also computed the average temperature of the photon gas in the early stage by means of the inverse slope of the photon spectrum : because of the pre - equilibrium dynamics , this quantity remains finite and in agreement with the temperature of the bulk already computed in @xcite , instead of being divergent as it would be if it evolved as @xmath87 , that is as in the case of a thermalized system in a one - dimensional expansion .    introducing a dynamics in the very early stage not only affects the total number of photons produced , but also the shape of the spectrum .",
    "in fact , in fig .  [",
    "fig : e ] we represent by the dotted green line the spectrum obtained at @xmath88 fm / c corresponding to the initialization time of the glauber calculation ; we call this the early stage contribution to the photon spectrum .",

    ". we notice that the late stage spectrum agrees with the one obtained within the glauber calculation : although the two initial conditions are different , the bulk evolution in the two models perfectly match each other starting from the glauber initialization time .",
    "we would be tempted to name the late stage spectrum as the equilibrium spectrum : however , a strict distinction between equilibrium and pre - equilibrium in the aftm does not apply , because local equilibration in the fireball of the aftm takes place at different times in different cells , while in the glauber model the spectrum is already equilibrated in the whole transverse plane at the initialization time .",
    "ratio of photon spectrum of the aftm over the one corresponding to the glauber calculation .",
    "green solid line corresponds to rhic collision and blue dashed line to lhc collision . ]    comparing the green dot - dashed and the maroon solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] , we notice that the most important photon production in the early stage takes place in the momentum region @xmath89 gev .",
    "we identify the enhancement of the photon spectrum from qgp in this momentum region as the sign of the early stage photons .    for a matter of comparison , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : f ] the ratio of the final photon spectrum of the aftm over the one corresponding to the glauber calculation : the green solid line corresponds to collisions at rhic while the blue dashed line to lhc collisions . for what concerns au - au collisions",
    ", we notice the enhancement of photon production within the aftm for @xmath89 gev with respect to the glauber calculation .",
    "the results for the lhc case , that are summarized in panel * ( b ) * of figure  [ fig : e ] , are qualitatively similar to those already discussed for the rhic case . for collisions at lhc",
    "we find that the domain @xmath90 gev can be identified with the one in which photons are produced in the very early stage .",
    "in this case we find that the photon abundancy obtained within the aftm is about the @xmath91 larger than the one obtained by the glauber initialization , thus the effect of the early stage seems to be smaller than the one observed in the case of rhic collisions .",
    "this can be easily understood because for collisions at lhc the early stage is considerably shorter than the one at rhic , and also the lifetime of the thermalized qgp at lhc is larger than the one at rhic , therefore the net effect of the early stage on photons produced by lhc collisions is naturally smaller than the one that we have measured for rhic collisions .",
    "therefore , we can summarize the results by stating that the early stage affects considerably both photon abundancy and the shape of the photon spectrum , because of the enhancement of photon production in the intermediate momentum region , namely @xmath89 gev at rhic and @xmath90 gev at lhc .",
    "we have studied the photon production from quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhics ) , putting emphasis on the role of the early stage quark - gluon scatterings on the direct photon spectrum .",
    "we have considered a model for the initial conditions in rhics , based on a classical gluon field mimicking the glasma , beside a mechanism for the conversion of the field to qgp ; the dynamics of the qgp has been studied by means of a simulation code based on relativistic transport theory coupled to the classical field dynamics .",
    "we have simulated both au - au collisions at rhic energy and pb - pb collisions at lhc energy .",
    "our approach , although simplified with respect to the more realistic situation based on glasma and its evolution , allows us to follow consistently the system since the very initial stage up to the freezout .    within our theoretical description ,",
    "qgp is produced since the very early stage by the decay of the classical gluon field by means of the schwinger mechanism .",
    "as soon as qgp is formed , quarks and gluons scatter and they can produce photons : our approach therefore allows us to compute the contribution of the qgp to the photon spectrum taking into account also the ones produced in the early stages , that have been neglected in previous studies .",
    "although in the collision integral we have considered only the @xmath92 photon production processes , we have artificially modified the scattering matrix of these processes in order to reproduce the celebrated amy rate , see fig .",
    "[ fig : b1 ] : as a consequence , our production rate agrees with the one commonly used in calculations based on hydro .    we have been able to identify a transverse momentum region in which direct photon spectrum is dominated by the early stage photons , namely @xmath89 gev for collisions at rhic and @xmath90 gev for collisions at lhc , see figg .",
    "[ fig : e ] and  [ fig : f ] .",
    "moreover , we have found that during the early stages the amount of photons produced is approximately within the @xmath93 of the total amount of photons produced by the qgp .",
    "this is a remarkable result considering that the lifetime of the early stage is at most one tenth of the full qgp lifetime in the fireball : we can conclude that the early stage is quite bright , or stated in other terms , that there is no dark age in rhics .",
    "we have not tried a comparison of our results with the existing rhic and lhc data about the direct photon spectrum .",
    "in fact , we think that in order to give firm conclusions on the role of the early stage photon production on the direct photon spectrum that is extracted by the experiments , it is important to add the contribution of the hadron gas that instead is missing in our present calculations .",
    "we plan to add this important contribution in future works , and after that it will be meaningful a direct comparison with experimental data .",
    "moreover , for a matter of simplicity we have not included here the bose - einstein enhancement factors in the collision integral , which are potentially relevant in the early stage due to the large gluon occupation numbers ; these have been considered in a recent study @xcite and we plan to include them in future works following @xcite .",

    "<S> we present results about photons production in relativistic heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the main novelty of our study is the calculation of the contribution of the early stage photons to the photon spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the initial stage is modeled by an ensemble of classical gluon fields which decay to a quark - gluon plasma via the schwinger mechanism , and the evolution of the system is studied by coupling classical field equations to relativistic kinetic theory ; photons production is then computed by including the pertinent collision processes into the collision integral . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the contribution of the early stage photons to the direct photon spectrum is substantial for @xmath0 gev and higher , the exact value depending on the collision energy ; therefore we identify this part of the photon spectrum as the sign of the early stage . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the amount of photons produced during the early stage is not negligible with respect to those produced by a thermalized quark - gluon plasma : we support the idea that there is no dark age in relativistic heavy ion collisions . </S>"
