    "signal propagation in the form of waves is a ubiquitous feature of the functioning of neural networks .",
    "waves transmitting electrical activity across neural structures have been observed in a large variety of situations , both in artificially grown cultures and in living brain tissues , see _",
    "e.g _  @xcite and @xcite for an instance of each case ; many other examples can be found in the literature .",
    "this experimental phenomenology has fostered numerous computational and analytical studies on theoretical models for wave propagation . to mention a single category of exact results",
    ", one can cite proofs of existence of waves with context dependent shape : fronts , pulses , periodic wave trains , etc , both in full voltage / conductance models and in firing rate models , see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "in parallel , numerical studies have investigated propagation features such as firing synchrony within cortical layers , and their dependence on dynamical ingredients : feedback , surrounding noise , or external stimulus , see for instance @xcite .",
    "our paper aims to develop a rigorous mathematical investigation of how the global dynamics of a ( simple model of a ) neural network may cause it to organize to a wave behavior , in spite of being forced by a rather unrelated signal .",
    "given that the natural setting of neural ensembles typically features an external environment that is prone to providing an array of irregular stimuli , it seems that such forcing is in no way _ a priori _ tailored toward generating periodic patterns in layered ensembles .",
    "nevertheless , recordings from tissues suggest that self - organization will often ensue despite this obvious and inherent mismatch .    in order to get insight into the generation of periodic traveling waves through _ ad hoc _ stimulus , we consider unidirectional chains of coupled oscillators .",
    "inspired by the propagation of synfire waves through cortical layers @xcite , such systems can be regarded as basic phase variable models of feed - forward networks featuring synchronized groups , in which each pool can be treated as a phase oscillator that repetitively alternates a refractory period with a firing burst .",
    "in addition , chains with unidirectional coupling as in equation below are representative of some physiological systems , such as central pattern generators @xcite .",
    "also , acyclic chains of type - i oscillators have been used as simple examples for the analysis of network reliability @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the model under consideration deals with chains of coupled phase oscillators whose dynamics is given by the following coupled odes @xmath2 where @xmath3 and    * @xmath4 .",
    "up to a rescaling of time , we can always assume that @xmath5 .",
    "* @xmath6 is the so - called phase response curve ( prc ) . recall that a type - i oscillator is one",
    "for which the prc is a non - negative one - humped function @xcite .",
    "* @xmath7 mimics incoming stimuli from the preceding node and also takes the form of a unimodal function . *",
    "the first oscillator at site @xmath8 evolves according to some forcing signal @xmath9 ( external stimulus ) , _ i.e. _  we have @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .",
    "the forcing is assumed to be continuous , increasing and periodic ( _ viz .",
    "_  there exists @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for all @xmath11 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the system for some smooth functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 and forcing signals such as the uniform function @xmath14 , have revealed that the asymptotic dynamics settles to a highly - organized regime , independently of initial conditions @xcite . as @xmath15 , the phase @xmath16 approaches the perturbation of a periodic function - the same function @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) at each site , up to an appropriate time shift @xmath19 - and this perturbation",
    "is attenuated by the chain in going further and further down . in brief terms , traveling waves are typically observed in the far - downstream , large time limit ; see fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] .",
    "mathematically speaking , this means that , letting @xmath20 denote the solution to with forcing @xmath9 ( and say , typical initial condition ) , there exists a periodic function @xmath17 and a time shift @xmath21 such that we have @xmath22 moreover , this phenomenon occurs for arbitrary forcing period , nor to @xmath23 ; see  @xcite for an illustration . ] in some range and also appears to be robust to changes in the coupling intensity @xmath24 .    , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) of oscillator phases @xmath29 with periodic boundary condition ( @xmath30 ) for a typical trajectory issued from a random initial condition , when forcing with a uniform signal @xmath14 .",
    "clearly , a traveling wave with periodic shape emerges in the far - downstream large time limit ( i.e. , as @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) . ]",
    "this behavior was somehow unanticipated because does not reveal any crucial properties usually required in the proofs of wave existence , such as the monotonicity of the profile dynamics ( analogous property to the maximum principle in parabolic pdes ) , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for lattice differential equations and @xcite for discrete time recursions .",
    ", we show that monotonicity with respect to pointwise ordering on sequences in @xmath33 fails in this system . ] in this context , proving the existence of waves remains unsolved and so is the stability problem , not to mention any justification of the generation phenomenon when forcing with _ ad hoc _ signal .",
    "notice however that , by assuming the existence of waves and their local stability for the single - site dynamics , a proof of stability for the whole chain has been obtained and applied to the design of numerical algorithms for the double - precision construction of wave shapes @xcite .",
    "( our stability proof here is inspired by this one . )    in order to get mathematical insights into wave generation under _ ad hoc _ forcing , here , we analyze simple piecewise affine systems for which the dynamics can be solved explicitly .",
    "this analysis can be viewed as an exploratory step in the endeavor of searching for full proofs in ( more general ) nonlinear systems .",
    "hence , the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are both assumed to be piecewise constant on the circle , taking on only the two distinct values of 1 ( on ) or 0 ( off ) .    in this setting , our analysis shows that the numerical phenomenology can be mathematically confirmed . for all parameter values",
    ", we prove the existence of tw with arbitrary period in some interval , and their global stability with respect to initial perturbations in the phase space @xmath34 , not only when the forcing at @xmath8 is chosen to be a tw shape but also for an open set of periodic signals with identical period .",
    "in addition , this open set is shown to contain uniform forcing @xmath14 provided that the coupling intensity @xmath24 is sufficiently small .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains the accurate definition of the initial value problem , the basic properties of the associated flow and the statements of the main results .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to proofs . in section [ s - exist ] ,",
    "we prove the existence of tw by establishing an explicit expression of their shape .",
    "we study the tw stability with respect to initial conditions in section [ s - stab ] by considering the associated stroboscopic dynamics , firstly for the first site , and then for the second site , from where the stability of the full chains is deduced .",
    "finally , stability with respect to changes in forcing is shown in section [ s - gener ] , as a by - product of the arguments developed in the previous sections .",
    "section [ s - concl ] offers some concluding remarks .",
    "as mentioned before , the dynamical systems under consideration in this paper are special cases of equation in which the stimulus @xmath7 and the prc @xmath6 are ( non - negative and normalized ) square functions , namely , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denotes the floor function ( recall that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 ) . @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote elements in @xmath41 whereas @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent functions of the real positive variable with values in @xmath41 . ]",

    "other cases are of interest , for instance , oscillators hearing poorly when transmitting , which corresponds to non - overlapping intervals . )",
    "more formally , we shall examine the following system of coupled differential equations for semi - infinite configurations @xmath48 @xmath49 where    * the forcing signal @xmath9 is assumed to be a lipschitz - continuous , @xmath50-periodic - valued @xmath9 as @xmath50-periodic provided that @xmath13 for all @xmath11 . ] ( @xmath51 ) , and increasing function with slope ( wherever defined ) at least 1 , is thought of being piecewise affine or even simply affine . ] and satisfying @xmath52 , * @xmath53 is an arbitrary initial configuration , * @xmath54 and @xmath55 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "solutions of equation are in general denoted by @xmath56 but the notation @xmath57 is also employed when the dependence on initial condition needs to be explicitly mentioned .",

    "in particular , since the information flow is unidirectional here , it is natural to only require that perturbations relax in pointwise topology , rather than in uniform topology .",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of unidirectional semi - infinite chains of type - i oscillators that are periodically forced at their root node , as an archetype of wave generation in neural networks . in previous studies , numerical simulations based on uniform forcing </S>",
    "<S> have revealed that trajectories approach a traveling wave in the far - downstream , large time limit . </S>",
    "<S> while this phenomenon seems typical , it is hardly anticipated because the system does not exhibit any of the crucial properties employed in available proofs of existence of traveling waves in lattice dynamical systems . here </S>",
    "<S> , we give a full mathematical proof of generation under uniform forcing in a simple piecewise affine setting for which the dynamics can be solved explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our analysis proves existence , global stability , and robustness with respect to perturbations of the forcing , of families of waves with arbitrary period / wave number in some range , for every value of the parameters in the system .    </S>",
