    "this is the third in a series of papers analyzing the structure and physical parameters of the shapley supercluster ( ssc ) , based on galaxy redshifts .",
    "the first ( quintana et al . 1995 ; hereafter _ paper i _ ) presents and gives an initial analysis of the results of spectroscopic observations of the central region .",
    "the second ( quintana , carrasco , & reisenegger 2000 , hereafter _ paper ii _ ) presents a much extended sample of galaxy redshifts and gives a qualitative discussion of the ssc s morphology . here",
    ", we use dynamical collapse models applied to this sample , in order to obtain the mass of the central region of the ssc . an upcoming paper ( carrasco , quintana , & reisenegger 2000 , hereafter _ paper iv _ ) will analyze the individual clusters of galaxies contained in the sample , to obtain their physical parameters ( velocity dispersion , size , mass ) , search for substructures within the clusters , and determine the total mass contained within the virialized regions of clusters in the whole shapley area .",
    "the shapley concentration ( shapley 1930 ) is the richest supercluster in the local universe ( zucca et al .",
    "1993 , einasto et al . 1997 , but see also batuski et al .",
    "this makes its study important for three main reasons .",
    "first , its high density of mass and of clusters of galaxies provides an extreme environment in which to study galaxy and cluster evolution .",
    "second , its existence and the fact that it is the richest supercluster in a given volume constrain theories of structure formation , and particularly the cosmological parameters and power spectrum in the standard model of hierarchical structure formation by gravitational instability ( e.g. , ettori , fabian , & white 1997 ; bardelli et al . 2000 ) . finally , it is located near the apex of the motion of the local group with respect to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "thus it is intriguing whether the ssc s gravitational pull may contribute significantly to this motion , although most mass estimates ( e.g. , raychaudhury 1989 ; raychaudhury et al .",
    "1991 ; paper i ; ettori et al . 1997 ; bardelli et al .",
    "2000 ) make a contribution beyond a 10 % level very unlikely .",
    "galaxy counts in redshift space ( bardelli et al .",
    "2000 ) suggest that most of the supercluster has a density several times the cosmic average , while the two complexes within @xmath7 mpc of clusters a 3558 and a 3528 have overdensities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "these regions are therefore far outside the `` linear regime '' of small density perturbations , but still far from being virialized after full gravitational collapse .",
    "the same conclusions are easily reached by even a casual glance at the redshift structure presented in paper ii .",
    "the density of these complexes indicates that they should be presently collapsing ( e.g. , bardelli et al . 2000 ) , and in the present paper we study this hypothesis for the main complex , around a 3558 , where substantially more data , with better areal coverage , are available ( see paper ii ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that within each of these complexes we expect very large peculiar velocities , which dominate by far over their hubble expansion . in this case",
    ", redshift differences among objects within each complex can give information about its dynamics , which we will analyze below , but essentially no information about relative positions along the line of sight ( except , perhaps , non - trivial information within a given dynamical model ) .",
    "while this is generally acknowledged to be true within clusters of galaxies , where galaxy motions have been randomized by the collapse , it is sometimes overlooked on somewhat larger , but still nonlinear scales .",
    "for instance , ettori et al .",
    "( 1997 ) calculate three - dimensional distances between clusters in the shapley region on the basis of their angular separations and redshifts , and conclude that the group sc 1327 - 312 and the cluster a 3562 , at projected distances @xmath10 and @xmath11 mpc from the central cluster a 3558 , are between 5 and @xmath12 mpc from it in three - dimensional space , because of moderate differences in redshift .",
    "however , there is evidence for interactions between these clusters and groups ( venturi et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggesting true distances much closer to the projected distances .",
    "the discrepancy is naturally explained by quite modest peculiar velocities of several hundreds of km s@xmath3 , easily caused by the large mass concentration .    in the present paper ,",
    "we analyze the region around a 3558 in terms of an idealized , spherical collapse model , which is used both in its pristine , but undoubtedly oversimplified , original form ( regs & geller 1989 ) , seen from a slightly different point of view , and in its less appealing , but possibly more accurate , modern fine - tuning calibrated by simulations ( diaferio & geller 1997 ; diaferio 1999 ) . section 2 explains the models , argues for the presence of velocity caustics , and gives the equations relating the caustics position to the mass distribution .",
    "( some mathematical remarks regarding this relation are given in the appendix . ) in  3 we present the data , argue that velocity caustics are indeed present , and explain how we locate their position quantitatively .",
    "section 4 presents and discusses our results , and  5 contains our main conclusions .",
    "in this approach , we consider a spherical structure in which matter at any radius @xmath13 moves radially , with its acceleration determined by the enclosed mass @xmath14 . at a given time @xmath15 of observation , the infall velocity @xmath16 ( traced by galaxies participating in the mass inflow ) can give direct information about the mass profile ( kaiser 1987 ; regs & geller 1989 ) .",
    "of course , @xmath17 is not directly observable . instead , for each galaxy we only observe its position on the sky , which translates into a projected distance from the assumed center of the structure , @xmath18 , and its redshift , which can be translated into a line - of - sight velocity @xmath19 with respect to the same center .",
    "the `` fundamental '' variables @xmath13 and @xmath20 and the `` observed '' variables @xmath21 and @xmath19 ( with the line - of - sight velocity of the structure s center already subtracted ) are related by    @xmath22^{1\\over 2}u(r).\\ ] ]    contrary to the hubble flow observed on large scales , @xmath19 is negative ( approaching ) for the more distant galaxies on the back side of each shell , and positive ( receding ) for the closer galaxies on the front side . at",
    "any given projected distance @xmath21 , one observes galaxies at many different true distances @xmath13 from the center .",
    "the infall velocity @xmath17 decreases at large enough distances @xmath13 , reaching zero at a finite ( `` turnaround '' ) radius @xmath23 , and matching onto the hubble flow , @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the projection factor increases from zero at @xmath26 ( galaxies moving perpendicularly to the line of sight ) , asymptotically approaching unity for @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , there will be some maximum projected velocity    @xmath28^{1\\over 2}u(r),\\ ] ]    which is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath21 ( see appendix ) , giving rise to caustics in the @xmath29 diagram with the characteristic `` trumpet shape '' described by kaiser ( 1987 ) and by regs & geller ( 1989 ) .    in order to obtain the infall velocity @xmath17 from the galaxy redshifts ,",
    "we first identify the caustics amplitude @xmath30 from the @xmath29 diagram by the procedure outlined in  3 .",
    "given this relation , we can invert eq .",
    "( 2 ) to obtain    @xmath31^{1\\over 2}}.\\ ] ]    this is an _",
    "in_equality rather than an equality because for an arbitrary shape of @xmath17 it is _ not _ guaranteed that the shells at _ every _ @xmath13 will correspond to a maximum amplitude for some @xmath21 ( see appendix for a detailed mathematical discussion ) .",
    "if the mass density decreases outwards , then the collapse occurs from the inside out , with innermost mass shells first reaching turnaround and recontraction , and outer shells following in succession .",
    "any given shell will enclose the same mass @xmath32 at all times until it starts encountering matter that has already passed through the center of the structure and is again moving outwards .",
    "the latter is only expected to happen in the very central , nearly virialized , part of the supercluster .",
    "elsewhere , the dynamics of any given shell is described by the well - known parameterized solution    @xmath33    ( e.g. , peebles 1993 , chapter 20 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants for any given shell ( related to each other by the enclosed mass @xmath32 ) , and @xmath36 labels the `` phase '' of the shell s evolution ( initial `` explosion '' at @xmath37 , maximum radius or `` turnaround '' at @xmath38 , collapse at @xmath39 ) .",
    "as we are observing many shells at one given cosmic time @xmath15 ( measured from the big bang , at which all shells started expanding , to the moment at which the structure emitted the light currently being observed ) , for each shell we can write    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the current value of the hubble parameter .",
    "we can determine an upper bound on @xmath42 , and therefore on @xmath43 , by the procedure described above ( note that @xmath13 itself depends on the uncertainty in the cosmic distance scale ) .",
    "the combination @xmath44 is a dimensionless constant , dependent on the cosmological model ( identified by dimensionless constants such as the density parameters @xmath45 ) . at the redshift of the ssc ( @xmath46 ) , it is likely to lie in the range @xmath47 , with the lower limit corresponding to an einstein - de sitter universe ( with critical matter density , @xmath48 , and no other ingredients ) , and the upper limit corresponding to an empty universe ( @xmath49 ) or a flat , low - density , @xmath50-dominated universe ( @xmath51 ) ( e.g. , peebles 1993 , chapter 13 ) . for an assumed value of this parameter ,",
    "the left - hand side becomes fully determined , and the equation can be solved for the value of @xmath36 for each shell .",
    "the equations can also be combined to yield    @xmath52    the mass enclosed within the shell ( of current radius @xmath13 ) .    for two reasons , _ a mass estimate obtained by applying this model to real data should be regarded as an upper bound on the true mass_. first , the model gives @xmath53 , an upper bound on @xmath17 , and this upper bound is used to derive the mass .",
    "second , the caustics amplitude @xmath30 is amplified through random motions due to substructure within the infalling matter ( diaferio & geller 1997 ) . keeping this in mind , we will use the model to put a bound on the mass of the collapsing region around a 3558 .      on the other hand ,",
    "diaferio & geller ( 1997 ; see also diaferio 1999 ) have shown that the mass profile of structures forming in numerical simulations can be recovered to good precision from the formula    @xmath54    there is no rigorous derivation for this result , although it can be justified heuristically by assuming that @xmath55 reflects the escape velocity at different radii , i.e. , that all galaxies within the caustics are gravitationally bound to the structure .",
    "one has to assume further that the radial density profile lies between @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( diaferio & geller 1997 ; diaferio 1999 ) , as in the outskirts of simulated clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) .",
    "this mass estimate is independent of the parameter @xmath44 , since no dynamical evolution is involved .",
    "it has already been applied to the coma cluster ( geller , diaferio , & kurtz 1999 ) .",
    "the @xmath29 diagram for the galaxies with available redshifts in the shapley region ( see paper ii ) , shown in fig . 1 for an adopted center at the main cluster a 3558 ( @xmath58 km s@xmath3 ) , indeed shows the predicted `` trumpet shape '' , with a maximum half - width @xmath59 km s@xmath3 , and extending cleanly out to @xmath60 mpc , and less cleanly to perhaps @xmath61 mpc from the center .",
    ", assumed to be of purely cosmological origin , relative line - of - sight velocities are given by @xmath62 ( harrison & noonan 1979 ) . in an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath63 ) , physical distances projected on the sky are given by @xmath64/[h_0(1+z_c)]$ ] ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ) , where @xmath65 is the angular distance in radians .",
    "again at the redshift of a 3558 , @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 mpc .",
    "the latter result is fairly insensitive to the choice of cosmological model , therefore we adopt it in general . ] thus , there is indeed a coherent structure ( _ `` extended core '' _ ) , enclosing at least ( i.e. , within @xmath1 mpc ) 11 abell clusters ( abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ) and three rich groups not included in the abell catalog ( see table 1 ) .",
    "all of these have relative velocities with respect to a 3558 smaller than 1200 km s@xmath3 , with a median @xmath68 km s@xmath3 .",
    "given its shape , this extremely cluster - rich structure is most likely due to gravitational collapse .",
    "of course , the morphology of the ssc or even of its `` extended core '' does not support the assumption of spherical symmetry . the inner core ( formed by a 3558 , a 3556 , a 3562 , sc 1327 - 312 , and sc 1329 - 314 ) is clearly elongated , and there is evidence that both the galaxies and the clusters in the region of interest tend to form a planar structure ( paper i ; bardelli et al .",
    "2000 ; paper ii ) .",
    "this is supported by the elementary fact that ( within the extended core and a fair distance beyond it ) all the clusters in the north ( a 3559 , a 3557a , a 3555 , further away a 1736b ) have lower redshifts than a 3558 , while those in the south ( a 3560 , a 3554 , others at larger distances ) and west ( particulary those belonging to the _ nw filament , _ which extends towards a 3528 and is described in paper ii ) have higher redshifts .",
    "it is also hinted at by the slight upturn of the structure in fig . 1 at @xmath69 ( @xmath70 mpc ) , which is due to the concentrations of clusters to the south - west and south - east of the central concentration .",
    "( the downward - pointing arm at @xmath71 is due to the clusters a 1736a , b and a 3571 . )    however , 1 ) the extreme simplicity of this symmetry assumption compared to any possible improvement to it , 2 ) our ignorance of the true 3-d distribution of _ matter _ in the supercluster , and 3 ) the fact that the gravitational potential is generally more spherical than the mass distribution originating it , motivate us to still apply a spherical model .",
    "note , in fact , that the model requires the gravitational potential to be spherically symmetric , but no symmetry assumptions are being made about the distribution of galaxies as tracer particles .",
    "although the structure appears well - defined to the eye , it does not have a perfectly sharp edge , as it would be expected to have in the perfect spherical infall model .",
    "departures from spherical symmetry , substructure such as clusters , the finite number of `` test particles , '' and ( to a much lesser degree ) observational uncertainties wash out and distort the structure .",
    "this makes a determination of the caustics non - trivial . in the rest of this section ,",
    "we follow diaferio s ( 1999 ) general approach in first smoothing the data , i.e. , obtaining a smooth estimate @xmath72 for the density of observed galaxies on the @xmath29 plane , and then applying a cut at some density contour which is taken to correspond to the caustics .",
    "the details of how each of these steps is carried out differ slightly from diaferio s approach , and are discussed in the rest of this section .      for a global analysis of the central ( collapsing ) region of the ssc",
    ", we need to obtain a smooth estimate @xmath72 of the density of galaxies in the @xmath29 diagram .",
    "density estimation has been discussed by many authors , such as silverman ( 1986 ) , and in the astronomical context pisani ( 1993 ; 1996 ) and merritt & tremblay ( 1994 ) .",
    "diaferio ( 1999 ) applied density estimation to the particular problem of interest here . for @xmath73 data points ( galaxies ) with coordinates @xmath74 , he adopts the estimate    @xmath75    where    @xmath76    is a smooth , but centrally peaked , kernel function .",
    "the ratio of smoothing lengths , @xmath77 is fixed , approximately equal to the ratio of observational uncertainties ( @xmath78 ) , and the individual values of , say , @xmath79 are chosen by an adaptive algorithm .    any choice of smoothing lengths is a compromise between keeping as much structure as possible ( favoring small smoothing lengths ) while eliminating as much noise as possible ( favoring large values ) . the ideal compromise , though quite subjective in any case , depends on the density of data points , which generally varies over the volume being studied , motivating the choice of a different smoothing length for each data point . for our particular application ,",
    "the density of points does not vary enormously over the area of interest , and we are only interested in the overall envelope of the structure , not in fine details .",
    "therefore , we consider the additional computational effort of adaptive smoothing with different local smoothing lengths unjustified .",
    "we apply fixed , overall smoothing lengths @xmath80 mpc , @xmath81 500 km s@xmath3 ( giving @xmath82 ) , chosen by eye to preserve the overall shape while minimizing the noise , and each corresponding to about 1/8 of the total extension of the structure studied . changing",
    "either of the two lengths by a factor of 2 either way does not substantially change our results .",
    "we note also that the chosen lengths are much larger than the respective uncertainties in the data , which therefore become irrelevant in determining the detected structures .",
    "one problem with the smoothing kernel given above is that the data have a natural cutoff at @xmath83 , where they go abruptly from a fairly high ( near maximum ) density ( at @xmath84 ) to zero ( at @xmath85 ) .",
    "when applied to points of small ( positive ) @xmath21 , the smoothing kernel extends to negative values ( where there are no data points ) , producing a decrease in @xmath72 when approaching @xmath83 from above .",
    "this causes isodensity contours to narrow as @xmath86 , as seen , e.g. , in fig . 1 of geller , diaferio , & kurtz ( 1999 ) , in figs . 4 and 5 of diaferio ( 1999 ) , and in fig .",
    "2a of the present paper .",
    "this can be cured , e.g. , by making a mirror image of the data at @xmath85 and letting the smoothing kernel integrate over both the real data and their image ( fig .",
    "2b ) . aside from correcting for the `` misbehavior '' at @xmath83",
    ", this procedure gives results very similar to that of diaferio ( 1999 ) .",
    "a more rigorous approach is suggested by merritt & tremblay ( 1994 ) , who deal with density estimation in circularly symmetric structures .",
    "they focus on the surface density @xmath87 ( number per unit area ) rather than the radial density @xmath88 ( number per unit radial coordinate ) , and estimate @xmath87 with a circularly averaged kernel . in our case ( with one additional coordinate @xmath19 , which is not affected by this problem ) , we can define a number density per unit ( projected ) area per unit line - of - sight velocity as @xmath89 and estimate it through a kernel which is a product of a standard , one - dimensional kernel for @xmath19 and a circularly averaged kernel for @xmath21 . in particularly , fig . 2c shows the results of applying to our data a one - dimensional quadratic ( _ epanechnikov _ ) kernel for @xmath19 , and an annularly averaged , two - dimensional quadratic kernel for @xmath21 .",
    "( see merritt & tremblay 1994 , eqs . 9a and 28a for explicit formulae . )",
    "the density @xmath90 obtained from this procedure is well - behaved in all respects , decreasing from @xmath83 outwards .",
    "indeed , it decreases so quickly that the density contours tend to close at fairly small radii , contrary to the visual impression from the data .",
    "therefore , these contours are unlikely to be realistic representations of the velocity caustics .",
    "a final alternative ( with the added virtue of reducing biases due to non - uniform spatial sampling ) is to normalize @xmath72 at each given @xmath21 with respect to the value at @xmath91 , i.e. , take a density estimate    @xmath92    with the `` original '' @xmath72 determined by any of the other methods ( the case shown in fig .",
    "2d is based on diaferio s estimator ) .",
    "this estimator gives results very similar to the first two .",
    "overall , we consider that the second procedure ( the `` mirror image '' density estimate ) is the one that most closely represents the visual appearance of the data , while at the same time having mathematically desirable properties ( smooth density contours slowly narrowing with increasing @xmath21 ) , and being close enough to diaferio s to permit a direct comparison of results .",
    "therefore , we use the `` mirror image '' density estimation for the analysis that follows .",
    "however , we stress that it is a very arbitrary choice , and that other choices may give quite different final results .",
    "discarding the very different result based on the `` surface density '' scheme , the other procedures discussed above give masses that , at any given radius , differ by less than 10 % from the one obtained by the `` mirror image '' procedure .",
    "given the estimated density @xmath93 , we now turn to finding the caustics which separate the collapsing structure from the galaxies in the foreground and background .",
    "we are again inspired by diaferio ( 1999 ) , who uses a fixed density cutoff , @xmath94 , with the value of @xmath95 fixed by virial arguments applied to the most central region . in principle , taking a fixed value is somewhat arbitrary . by plotting in @xmath29 space , we are summing galaxies over annuli , and therefore a uniform background of galaxies would result in a density increasing @xmath96 , and therefore a fixed cutoff might include more and more of the background as @xmath21 increases .",
    "the problem is worsened by the non - uniformly sampled data in our particular case .",
    "therefore , a more natural and in principle better way to distinguish the structure from the background might be to fix on maxima of @xmath97 for each @xmath21 .",
    "however , taking and maximizing a _ derivative _ of the numerically determined function is much noisier than just imposing a fixed cutoff .",
    "therefore , we follow diaferio in adopting the latter approach .    in order to choose the value of the cutoff , diaferio ( 1999 ) uses the virial theorem to relate the escape velocity ( in his interpretation represented by the velocity amplitude @xmath55 ) and the velocity dispersion @xmath98 of the central cluster , therefore writing @xmath99 , where the average is a galaxy number - weighted average over the region enclosed by the virial radius @xmath100 of the central cluster , for a given density cutoff @xmath95 . for a 3558",
    ", the velocity dispersion is a relatively robust number ( @xmath101 km s@xmath3 ) , not sensitive to the radius of the sphere to be averaged over , and in the central region @xmath55 ( determined with any reasonable cutoff ) is also fairly radius - independent .",
    "therefore , the dependence on the ( poorly determined ) virial radius is weak , and we arbitrarily choose it as @xmath102 mpc , and do a straight radial average ( _ not _ number - weighted ) to calculate @xmath103 and determine @xmath95 by diaferio s condition .",
    "we tested the validity of diaferio s condition by the following procedure .",
    "figure 3 shows the area of the @xmath29 diagram enclosed by contour levels with different @xmath95 .",
    "we clearly distinguish 3 regimes :    * at very low densities , the enclosed area is most of the diagram , therefore enclosing much of the background , not belonging to the structure .",
    "the area rapidly decreases as the threshold density is increased . * at intermediate densities , the decreasing curve becomes much flatter ( @xmath104 constant ) , and we interpret this as having most of the background excluded and probing progressively denser parts of the structure .",
    "this is confirmed by watching the contour plots , which indeed trace the boundaries of the structure , and become progressively tighter . *",
    "finally , at high values of @xmath95 , only a few isolated peaks in the structure are left enclosed , and these finally disappear when @xmath95 reaches the maximum density present .",
    "this analysis suggests choosing the threshold at the transition between regimes ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this falls close to the threshold value chosen by diaferio s ( 1999 ) condition as outlined above , marked by the vertical line .",
    "this strengthens the argument for diaferio s choice of cutoff , already used to choose the contours in fig . 2 , and adopted hereafter .",
    "the chosen density contour of course gives two values of @xmath19 ( one positive , @xmath105 , and one negative , @xmath106 ) for each value of @xmath21 . in the ssc",
    ", it turns out that the upper contour is much `` cleaner '' ( separating a dense region from a nearly empty one ) , therefore we simply adopt @xmath107 rather than diaferio s prescription @xmath108",
    "fig . 4 shows the enclosed mass as a function of radius , @xmath14 , as determined by the two methods discussed in  2 , together with a third determination , namely the cumulative mass of the clusters enclosed in the given radius , given in table 1 .",
    "note that the mass estimates @xmath109 , taken from ettori et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the most important clusters , are masses within a radius enclosing an average density 500 times the critical density @xmath110 .",
    "this is substantially higher than the standard `` virialization density '' of @xmath111 , and therefore gives a conservative lower limit to the total virialized mass , which may be increased by a factor @xmath112 for a more realistic estimate .",
    "several comments are in order :    \\1 ) as discussed above , the pure spherical infall model is highly idealized and , even if correct , can only give an upper bound on the mass within any given radius .",
    "therefore , the upper ( dot - dashed ) curve , corresponding to pure spherical collapse in a cosmological model with @xmath113 should be regarded as a fairly robust upper limit to the mass within any given radius .",
    "\\2 ) the model of diaferio & geller ( 1997 ) has been calibrated against simulations . applied to the infall regions around clusters of galaxies ,",
    "it should in principle give the correct mass to within about @xmath114 ( geller et al .",
    "however , it assumes a density profile decreasing at least as fast as @xmath115 , which may not apply to the very noisy region around a 3558 , which contains a number of other , fairly rich clusters .",
    "it appears surprising that the mass profile it gives for this region is quite similar ( both in shape and in amplitude ) to that obtained by geller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , considering that coma is a quite massive cluster ( as massive or perhaps even more massive than a 3558 ) , but is _ not _ surrounded by any other massive clusters .",
    "\\3 ) the mass estimate based on individual cluster masses is uncertain for two reasons .",
    "first , of course it does not consider the mass in the non - virialized outskirts of the clusters or not associated with clusters at all , and therefore it would be expected to underestimate the total mass . on the other hand , in the absence of information on the three - dimensional distance @xmath13 of each cluster to a 3558 , and given that the velocity does not give reliable distance information within the collapsing structure , each cluster was put at its projected radius @xmath18 , and therefore contributes to the enclosed mass already at radii smaller than its true position .",
    "therefore , the mass in virialized clusters within any given radius @xmath14 is overestimated by the projection into radius @xmath13 of clusters actually at larger radii .    given these caveats",
    ", there seems to be fair agreement among the different mass determinations , and it seems safe to say that the mass enclosed by radius @xmath116 mpc lies between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "it is interesting , nevertheless , that diaferio s method gives results that differ so little from the lower limit to the virialized mass in clusters .",
    "therefore , if diaferio s method is applicable to the ssc , the either there would be very little mass outside the inner , virialized parts of clusters of galaxies in this region , or the cluster mass estimates would have to be systematically high .    for comparison , ettori et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used three different mass estimates , namely : 1 ) the sum of the gravitational masses of clusters as obtained from their x - ray emission profile , @xmath119 , 2 ) the total mass expected to be associated with the baryons observed in clusters , @xmath120 , and 3 ) the mass obtained from applying the virial theorem to the enclosed clusters , used as test particles , @xmath121 .",
    "they applied these methods to four progressively larger structures , each enclosing the previous one .",
    "the one most similar to our @xmath1 mpc sphere appears to be the second , enclosing 12 clusters , and with a nominal 3-d radius of @xmath122 mpc , obtained by treating redshift as a third coordinate , which we have argued to give an overestimated depth in the collapsing region . for this region , they find @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , all in units of @xmath126 .",
    "the first two are likely underestimates ( as they consider only the matter in the virialized regions of clusters observed in x - rays ) , and the third is completely uncertain , given the uncertain distances along the line of sight and the fact that the ssc is not virialized ( but see small et al .",
    "1998 for a modern , more careful application of the virial theorem to the corona borealis supercluster ) .",
    "thus , it is reasonable that we find a somewhat higher mass for the ( optically observed ) clusters , and a possibly much higher total dynamical mass , as suggested by the spherical collapse model .    the average enclosed density ( see fig .",
    "5 ) drops from a value 400  500 times the critical density within @xmath127 mpc ( consistent with the presence of a massive , already collapsed and virialized cluster ) to a value still several times critical ( @xmath128 to 23 times , depending on the model ) within our outermost radius , @xmath1 mpc . from galaxy counts in redshift space ,",
    "bardelli et al . ( 2000 ) find an overdensity @xmath129 within a region of equivalent radius @xmath130 mpc . assuming that galaxies trace mass , this might in principle allow us to determine the universal matter density parameter @xmath131 in practice , however , the uncertainty in this estimate is still much too large to put a useful constraint on @xmath132 .",
    "6 shows that , in the spherical collapse model , the whole structure within @xmath1 mpc has already been contracting for more than 1/3 of its lifetime , and the inner regions are in the final stages of collapse , consistent with the presence of a massive cluster .",
    "even if there were no additional mass beyond @xmath1 mpc , the current turnaround radius would be at @xmath133 mpc , and the bound region ( to collapse eventually ) would extend to @xmath134 mpc , enclosing essentially the whole supercluster , including the strong concentration around a 3528 , a 3530 , and a 3532 .",
    "however , the much lower enclosed densities in the diaferio & geller model would imply that the @xmath1 region around a 3558 is ( at best ) only now reaching turnaround , and has another hubble time to go for final collapse .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the mass required at the distance of the ssc to produce the observed motion of the local group with respect to the cosmic microwave background is given by    @xmath135    the mass within @xmath136 mpc can therefore produce at most @xmath137 of the observed local group motion , which makes it unlikely that even the whole ssc would dominate its gravitational acceleration .",
    "unfortunately , not much can be said about the regions beyond a radius of @xmath138 mpc from the center .",
    "it seems safe to assert , though , that the collapsing region does not extend far beyond , say , @xmath61 mpc .",
    "this gives an upper bound on the average density enclosed in larger radii , @xmath139 .",
    "thus , in order to produce the peculiar velocity of the local group , one would need a region of radius    @xmath140    which , for the range of cosmological values considered before , corresponds to a lower limit @xmath141 mpc .",
    "therefore , in the unlikely case that the whole ssc ( characterized in paper ii ) were on the verge of gravitational collapse , it would be able to produce on its own the observed peculiar velocity of the local group .",
    "this statement ignores , of course , that the apex of the local motion does not point exactly at the ssc , and therefore some additional contribution is necessary in any case .",
    "we have presented the ( to our knowledge ) first application of a plausible dynamical model to a supercluster of galaxies , containing a substantial number of clusters .",
    "the central @xmath1 mpc region of the shapley spercluster ( and probably a much more extended region surrounding it ) is argued to be currently collapsing under the effect of its own gravity .",
    "its mass , although uncertain due to idealizations in the model , indicates a large enhancement over the average density of the universe , although still far from that required to produce the local group s observed motion with respect to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the authors thank a. diaferio for interesting discussions at the first princeton - u .",
    "catlica astrophysics workshop , _ the cosmological parameters @xmath45 , _ held in pucn , chile , in january 1999 , and for extensive e - mail exchanges thereafter .",
    "a previous version of the kernel smoothing program used here was due to a. meza .",
    "we also thank him and r. benguria for useful discussions .",
    "this work was financially supported by fondecyt grant 8970009 ( _ proyecto de lneas complementarias _ ) , and by a presidential chair in science awarded to h. quintana .",

    "in order to derive and understand intuitively the properties of the observed velocity amplitude @xmath30 and the infall velocity @xmath17 producing it in the spherical model , it is convenient to define new variables @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 .",
    "then ,        note that , seen as a function of @xmath148 for given @xmath100 , @xmath149 is a straight line intersecting the horizontal axis at @xmath150 and the vertical axis at @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath152 defines a set of straight lines whose upper envelope gives the function @xmath153 ( see fig .",
    "the relation between the functions @xmath152 and @xmath153 is very similar to the _ legendre transformation _",
    "( e.g. , courant & hilbert 1989 , ",
    "i.6 ) , and shares many of its properties .    since @xmath154 for all @xmath100 , *",
    "@xmath153 is positive ( @xmath155 ) , monotonically decreasing ( @xmath156 ) , and convex ( @xmath157 ) . *",
    "8 shows the function @xmath153 obtained from the data in the way described in this paper .",
    "it is clear that it does not strictly satisfy the conditions of monotonicity and convexity , indicating that , as expected , the pure spherical infall model does not exactly represent the data .",
    "@xmath158 is a strictly increasing function , but it is not necessarily continuous .",
    "for example , it can happen that , for some point @xmath164 , the maximum occurs at the intersection of two straight lines labeled by @xmath166 and @xmath167 ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , with the lines corresponding to all other values of @xmath100 lying below it , i.e. ,          this is an equality for those @xmath100 which correspond to a maximum @xmath149 for some @xmath148 , and a strict inequality in all other cases .",
    "the latter can in principle be diagnosed by realizing that , in the case discussed above ,      so both @xmath158 and @xmath172 are discontinuous at @xmath159 . in practice , with noisy data , a discontinuity in @xmath172 is difficult to detect , and the inequality , eq .",
    "( a5 ) , has to be used as such .",
    "it is interesting to note that , taking the reciprocal value of all variables , one can write      this has the same form as eq .",
    "( a1 ) . we can conclude that @xmath174 has the same properties as @xmath153 , being positive , monotonically decreasing , and convex , in fact , it is the convex and decreasing lower envelope of @xmath175 . as long as the latter is itself convex and decreasing , then @xmath176 , while in general @xmath177 .",
    "10 shows @xmath174 as obtained from the data .",
    "its curved parts ( here absent ) and `` corners '' are expected ( within the pure spherical collapse model ) to correctly estimate @xmath175 , while the straight segments are lower bounds .",
