    "since abrikosov s @xcite prediction of the flux - line lattice in type - ii superconductors from ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , most theoretical work on this vortex lattice in bulk and thin film superconductors considered the situation when the applied magnetic field and the average induction @xmath5 are close to the upper critical field @xmath6 , since analytical solutions may be obtained for this particular case . in the opposite limit of low induction @xmath7 , the properties of an isolated vortex and the interaction between vortices are obtained to good approximation from the london theory when the gl parameter @xmath0 is not too small , @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite the problem of an isolated vortex in thin films was solved analytically within london theory by pearl @xcite ; the interaction energy of such pearl vortices ( or pancake vortices @xcite ) is easily calculated by noting that within london theory the currents and magnetic fields of the vortices superimpose linearly and that the force on a vortex equals the thickness - integrated super - current density at the vortex core times the quantum of flux @xmath9 . in thin films with thickness @xmath10 smaller than the london magnetic penetration depth @xmath11 the range of the vortex ",

    "the present paper extends this two - dimensional ( 2d ) method to the 3d problem of a film of arbitrary thickness containing a periodic lattice of gl vortices oriented perpendicular to the film plane . due to the fourier ansatz",
    ", the magnetic stray field energy is easily accounted for in this method .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the extension from 2d to a 3d problem only slightly increases the required computation time and computer memory , so that high precision can be achieved easily on a personal computer . like in refs .",

    "the field lines at the boundary of the wigner - seitz cell are exactly parallel to @xmath24 , inside and outside the superconductor , and at some distance outside from the surface ( @xmath25 half the vortex spacing ) the magnetic field becomes uniform and thus the field lines are parallel and equidistant . for the _ isolated vortex _ , the field lines away from the surface approach radial lines as if they would originate from a point source , a magnetic monopole with strength @xmath26 situated on the vortex core at a distance @xmath27 below the surface .",

    "_ second method : _ in this paper the 2d plots of the magnetic field lines show the contour lines of the function @xmath382 + which ranges from @xmath383 at @xmath384 ( vortex center ) to @xmath385 ( middle plane between two vortices ) and has a periodic derivative .",
    "such field lines have a 1d density along @xmath130 proportional to @xmath386 , and a density perpendicular to these lines which is close to @xmath376 , since their orientation is close to the orientation of @xmath174 .",
