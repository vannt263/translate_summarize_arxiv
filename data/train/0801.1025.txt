    "noble gases like he , ne , xe and ar , have been intensively studied during the last decades , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "@xcite due to their simple electronic closed - shell structure , they appear to be affordable many - body systems where to carry out feasible quantum computations and test novel methods of calculation .",
    "even though most of them are regarded as classical systems , microscopic quantum approaches are required to understand the behavior of the lighter ones , he and ne , at low temperatures . as it is well - known , he is the most representative of the quantum many - body systems .",
    "unique features like bose - einstein condensation and superfluidity take place in the liquid at few k and recently several experimental groups have detected superfluid signal in the solid phase in the mk range ,  @xcite a signal that in the homogeneous crystal has been ruled out by accurate theoretical calculations .",
    "@xcite moreover , the atomic momentum distribution , @xmath5 , of @xmath4he differs significantly from those of classical systems leading to a non - gaussian @xmath5 curve sharply peaked around @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite the reasons for those phenomena to happen in helium are the light mass of the atoms , bosonic nature of the system and weakness of the interparticle interactions . on the other side ,",
    "ne has long attracted the interest of condensed - matter scientists since it is an intermediate quantum system which provides valuable physical insight when compared to other quantum and classical systems .",
    "indeed , the de boer quantum parameter  @xcite defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the atomic mass , energy scale of the atomic interactions and typical interatomic distance of the system , respectively , amounts to @xmath11 in ne ( @xmath12 in @xmath13he ) while in ar and other heavier noble gases , where classical behavior is expected , it drops significantly to zero .",
    "essentially , the quantum character of liquid and solid ne is evidenced on their atomic kinetic energies and momentum distributions , which differ appreciably from the predictions made by classical statistical mechanics .",
    "accordingly , anharmonic effects in the crystal may develop important at low temperatures due to the large zero - point motion of the atoms .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we study solid ne at zero temperature by means of the diffusion monte carlo method ( dmc )  @xcite and the aziz hfd - b pair potential",
    ".  @xcite our approach is microscopic and _ exact _ in the sense that the total and partial ground - state energies of the crystal may be calculated within statistical uncertainty only .",
    "there are burdens of theoretical and experimental papers dealing with the thermodynamics and lattice dynamics of solid neon , however , numerical results for the atomic kinetic energy are not so abundant . by the beginning of the 60 s ,",
    "bernades  @xcite and nosanow _ et al . _",
    "@xcite were the first in attempting to estimate @xmath0 theoretically .",
    "they used uncorrelated single - particle wave functions within the variational and hartree approaches , respectively , and arrived at reasonable values not too far from present - day calculations ; however , the binding energies that they reported were in significant disagreement with experimental data .",
    "these results made evident the need of improved theoretical schemes where to account for the atomic correlations in ne .",
    "few years after bernades and nosanow works , koehler estimated @xmath14  k by means of the self consistent phonon approach ( scp ) , improving mildly the agreement with experiments .",
    "@xcite    on the experimental side , however , it has not been until the beginning of the 80 s , with the development of the deep - inelastic neutron scattering technique ( dins ) , that direct measurement of @xmath0 in the condensed phases of matter has become accessible . peek _",
    "_ performed the first measurements in solid ne , covering the temperature interval @xmath15  k.  @xcite the authors of the first study reported @xmath16  k for the ground - state kinetic energy and , because of the large discrepancies with respect to calculations based on harmonic models , they suggested substantial anharmonic effects in solid ne .",
    "reassuringly , few years after peek _ et al . _ s measurements ,  @xcite theoretical estimations by asger and usmani ,  @xcite who used a perturbational approach based on a wigner - kirkwood high - temperature expansion with the lennard - jones ( l - j ) and aziz hfd - c2  @xcite pair potentials , amounted to @xmath17  k at temperatures near @xmath18  k. regardless , previous to asger _ et al .",
    "_ s results ,  @xcite cuccoli and co - workers  @xcite arrived at kinetic energies @xmath19  k below peek s results , based on the full quantum approach path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) and the l - j interaction .",
    "the authors of this work suggested that their disagreement with peek s results could be in part due to the oversimplification of the atomic interactions made by the adopted potential .",
    "subsequently , timms _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite performed a series of new low - temperature dins experiments in solid ne at high momentum tranfers with an improved experimental set - up .",
    "they found very good agreement with cuccoli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and also with ceperley and boninsegni ,  @xcite who performed an exhaustive pimc study of the crystal at low temperatures using both l - j and hfd - c2 pair potentials . in addition , a recent theoretical study by neumann and zoppi , in which computational techniques and interatomic potentials similar to those of ref .",
    "are used , comes to reinforce the accuracy of timms data .",
    "@xcite very recently , timms _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have reported new additional dins measurements in solid ne performed within the temperature range @xmath3  k. by doing this , they complement their previous results and provide a truster way to infer the value of @xmath0 in the ground state , which by means of extrapolation of the excess kinetic energy turns out to be @xmath2  k.    in the present work , we report quantum monte carlo results of the equation of state and other thermodynamic properties of solid ne over a range of densities near equilibrium ( @xmath20  kbar ) , and find overall excellent agreement with experimental data . structural properties of the crystal , namely the radial pair - distribution function , @xmath21 , atomic density profile around the positions of the perfect crystalline lattice ( sites ) and lindemann ratio , are also provided . remarkably , we estimate accurately the atomic kinetic energy of the crystal at its equilibrium density by means of the pure estimator technique within dmc .  @xcite our result , @xmath22  k , is in very good agreement with the recent prediction of timms _",
    "et al_.  @xcite we have also calculated the ground - state atomic momentum distribution @xmath5 of solid ne and it is found to fit perfectly to a gaussian within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "additionallly , we have analyzed the degree of anharmonicity of solid ne in its ground state . with this aim ,",
    "we have computed the atomic kinetic energy and mean squared displacement within the self consistent average phonon ( scap ) approach ,  @xcite which is a simplified version of the self consistent phonon method  @xcite that has proved successful in reproducing a deal of thermodynamic properties of rare gas solids .",
    "we find the scap results are not in full agreement with the quantum dmc ones , thus revealing this approach might not allow for an accurate description of ne at the microscopic level . in a further step ,",
    "we devise an harmonic model based on the hfd - b potential in which the interaction between particles depend on their relative distances , equilibrium positions and the force constant field ( second derivatives of the potential energy evaluated in the perfect crystal configuration ) . by using dmc",
    ", we calculate the total and kinetic energies associated to this model and find significant discrepancies with respect to the full hfd - b results .",
    "according to these outcomes , solid ne may be regarded as a _ moderate _ anharmonic crystal since , contrarily to what is observed in solid @xmath13he , its @xmath5 does not deviate appreciably from the gaussian pattern .",
    "the remainder of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : techniques ] , we describe the computational techniques and models that have been used on this study .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present our results and compare to previous experimental and theoretical data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we finalize by summarizing the main conclusions and giving some general remarks .",
    "dmc is a zero - temperature method which provides the exact ground - state energy of the many - boson interacting systems within some statistical errors .",
    "@xcite this technique is based on a short - time approximation for the green s function corresponding to the imaginary time - dependent schr@xmath23dinger equation , which is solved up to a certain order of accuracy within an infinitesimal interval @xmath24 . despite this method",
    "is algorithmically simpler than domain green s function monte carlo ,  @xcite it presents some @xmath25 bias coming from the factorization of the imaginary time propagator @xmath26 . nevertheless",
    ", our implementation of dmc is quadratic ,  @xcite hence the control of the time - step bias is efficiently controlled since the required @xmath27 extrapolation is nearly eliminated by choosing a sufficiently small time step .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath28 , describing our system is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of a ne atom , @xmath31 the distance between atoms composing an @xmath32,@xmath33 pair and @xmath34 the interatomic interaction that we have chosen as the aziz hfd - b potential .",
    "@xcite the corresponding schr@xmath23dinger equation in imaginary time ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 with @xmath37 an arbitrary constant , can be formally solved by expanding the solution @xmath38 in the basis set of the energy eigenfunctions @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath38 tends to the ground - state wave function @xmath40 of the system for an infinite imaginary time as well as the expected value of the hamiltonian tends to the ground - state value @xmath41 .",
    "the hermiticity of the hamiltonian guarantees the equality @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a convenient trial wave function which depends on the atomic coordinates of the system @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , the ground - state energy of the system can be computed by calculating the integral @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the local energy defined as @xmath48 . the introduction of @xmath49 in @xmath50 is known as importance sampling and it certainly improves the way in which integral ( [ eq : integral ] ) is computed ( for instance , by imposing @xmath51 when @xmath31 is smaller than the core distance of the interatomic interaction ) .    in this work ,",
    "all the operators diagonal in real - space which do not commute with the hamiltonian , that is @xmath52 \\neq 0 $ ] , have been sampled with the pure estimator technique .",
    "@xcite with this method , essentially , the possible bias induced by @xmath43 in the mixed estimator @xmath53 are removed by proper weighting of the configurations along the simulation .",
    "we have modeled solid ne by assuming point - like atoms interacting via a radial pair - wise potential and with equilibrium positions distributed according to the fcc structure .",
    "neon is observed to remain stable in the fcc structure up to pressures of @xmath54  kbar and at ambient temperature ,  @xcite therefore , no other configuration apart from this has been considered in the present study .",
    "the potential chosen for the interatomic interactions is the semi - empirical aziz hfd - b one ,  @xcite which has proved excellent in reproducing some of the macroscopic and microscopic properties of ne over a wide range of temperature and pressure ,  @xcite and appears to be more realistic than the aziz hfd - c2  @xcite and lennard - jones ( l - j ) models at short distances .",
    "explicitly , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 &   x < d    \\\\        1    &      x \\geq d ~. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the value of the parameters of the potential are @xmath58  , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61    , @xmath62  , @xmath63  k  , @xmath64  , @xmath65   and @xmath66  , with @xmath67  . it is known that , upon high pressure the introduction of additional terms in the effective atomic potentials of rare gases are required to account for many - body effects taking place on them ; for instance , in solid ar this limit is posed around @xmath68  kbar .",
    "@xcite this circumstance , however , does not affect the reliability of the results that we are to present in short , since the pressure range involved in our simulations is @xmath69  kbar .",
    "regarding the trial wave function chosen for importance sampling , @xmath43 , we have adopted the extensively used and tested nosanow - jastrow model ,  @xcite @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72  .",
    "the best parameter values are @xmath73  @xmath74 , @xmath75     and @xmath76  , optimized using the variational monte carlo method .",
    "their dependence with the pressure is small and therefore neglected for its use on the dmc simulations .",
    "the first factor in @xmath43 accounts for the correlations between particles induced by the interactions , while the second enforces the atomic ordering within the system by attaching each particle to one site of the perfect lattice through a gaussian function .",
    "the indistinguishability of the ne atoms has been neglected throughout this work since the nosanow - jastrow model is not symmetric under the exchange of particles .",
    "this choice is fairly justified since quantum effects derived from a correct symmetrization are not expected to play any significant role in the solid properties calculated in this work . in fact , the same conclusion for the same quantities also holds for solid @xmath4he , a solid with a larger quantum behavior .",
    "the parameters of the simulation , namely the number of particles per box , time step and target walker population ( that is , the mean number of walkers along the simulation ) , have been chosen in order to ensure the correct asymptotic behavior ; their respective values are :  @xmath77  , @xmath78  k@xmath79 and @xmath80  .    at each density ,",
    "finite size effects have been corrected by including the tails of the kinetic and potential energies into the total energy , both estimated assuming @xmath81 beyond half the length of the simulation box .",
    "this assumption could be too crude for solids ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gr ] ) and therefore we have checked the reliability of this approximation in our system . to this end , we have carried out some simulations with 500 atoms and compared the energetic and structural results with the ones obtained for a box of 256 particles at the same density .",
    "for instance , at a density @xmath82  @xmath83 the energies are @xmath84  k and @xmath85  k and the lindemann ratios @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 particles , respectively .",
    "the differences observed are therefore not significant within our statistical uncertainty and the size corrections are reasonably included .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : eos ] ( left ) , we show our results for the total atomic energy of solid ne at zero temperature . the solid line on it corresponds to the polynomial curve , @xmath90 , @xmath91 which has been fitted to the dmc energies reported in table  [ tab : energies ] ( solid points in the figure ) .",
    "the values of the parameters of the best fit are @xmath92  k , @xmath93  k , @xmath94  k and @xmath95  @xmath83  , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the equilibrium energy per particle and density , respectively .",
    "the agreement between our results and experiments is reasonably good for the energy @xmath98  k and the density @xmath99  @xmath83 .",
    "@xcite    once @xmath100 is known , it is straightforward to deduce the pressure , @xmath101 ( see fig .  [",

    "@xcite    an interesting magnitude in the study of condensed phase systems is the spinodal density , @xmath106 , which is the thermodynamical limit for the system to remain in homogeneous phase . at this density ,",
    "the relation @xmath107   is fulfilled , which is equivalent to require infinite compressibility or zero speed of sound in the system .",
    "our prediction for @xmath106 is @xmath108  @xmath83 , which corresponds to a pressure @xmath109  kbar . in ref .",

    "the disagreement between this and our value for @xmath112 can be explained in terms of the adopted interatomic potential , since small differences in the total energies may develop large within successive derivatives .      and the dots to the calculated dmc total energies per particle , errors bars are smaller than the size of the symbols .",

    "by comparing these two figures , one could claim that anharmonic effects in solid ne are about one order of magnitude less substantial than in @xmath13he .",
    "in this work , we report the calculation of the ground - state atomic kinetic energy , one - body density matrix and momentum distribution of solid ne by means of the dmc method and the realistic aziz hfd - b pair - potential . our approach is proved to perform notably for this crystal , as it is shown by the very good overall agreement obtained with respect to thermodynamic experimental data .",

    "consequently , the atomic momentum distribution , which is evaluated by performing the fourier transform of @xmath130 , is of the same kind .",
    "interestingly , withers and glyde  @xcite have shown very recently by means of simple models that the deviation of @xmath147 from a gaussian pattern in quantum solids may arise by effect of anharmonicity and/or the introduction of atomic exchanges .",
    "we have checked that anharmonic effects in the ground - state of solid ne are relevant by calculating some of its microscopic properties within traditional harmonic schemes and quoting significant discrepancies with respect to the full quantum results .",
    "it is noted that we have not attempted to include atomic exchange effects in the present work since _ a priori _ and very reasonably , these are not expected to play any substantial role in the ground - state of solid ne ( contrarily to what may occur in @xmath13he , for instance ) .",
    "even so , we do not appreciate , within the statistical uncertainty , any deviation from a gaussian pattern in the @xmath130 , or equivalently @xmath147 , of solid ne , therefore , the degree of anharmonicity of ne at zero temperature may be regarded as fairly moderate .",

    "<S> we report on the calculation of the ground - state atomic kinetic energy , @xmath0 , and momentum distribution of solid ne by means of the diffusion monte carlo method and aziz hfd - b pair potential . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is shown to perform notably for this crystal since we obtain very good agreement with respect to experimental thermodynamic data . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we study the structural properties of solid ne at densities near the equilibrium by estimating the radial pair - distribution function , lindemann s ratio and atomic density profile around the positions of the perfect crystalline lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our value for @xmath0 at the equilibrium density is @xmath1  k , which agrees perfectly with the recent prediction made by timms _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ , @xmath2  k , based on their deep - inelastic neutron scattering experiments carried out over the temperature range @xmath3  k , and also with previous path integral monte carlo results obtained with the lennard - jones and aziz hfd - c2 atomic pairwise interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the one - body density function of solid ne is calculated accurately and found to fit perfectly , within statistical uncertainty , to a gaussian curve . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we analyze the degree of anharmonicity of solid ne by calculating some of its microscopic ground - state properties within traditional harmonic approaches . we provide insightful comparison to solid @xmath4he in terms of the debye model , in order to size the relevance of anharmonic effects in ne . </S>"
