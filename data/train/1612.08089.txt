    "as a preface to the themes of this paper , it is difficult to improve on the introduction by @xcite , which we quote directly :    in this paper we continue an exploration of the globular cluster systems ( gcss ) around brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , the central dominant objects in rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "this bcg program extends our earlier work on central giant galaxies at distances within 100 mpc @xcite outward to richer galaxy - cluster environments and higher bcg luminosities .",
    "paper i of the current series @xcite presents new deep photometry obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) cameras around seven bcgs at distances from 100 to 250 mpc , along with an analysis of the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of their gcs .",
    "we found the gclfs to be strikingly similar in all systems , with trends that extend previous analyses for smaller galaxies @xcite smoothly upward to the largest galaxy sizes known .",
    "paper ii @xcite presents a more comprehensive analysis of the gcs around one of these bcgs , ngc 6166 in abell 2199 , with the focus on its gcs metallicity distribution , spatial distribution , and total gc population .    in this paper , we present similar data for two of the other bcgs in our program , ugc 9799 ( abell 2052 ) and ugc 10143 ( abell 2147 ) , as well as new data reductions for the two supergiant galaxies ngc 4874 and 4889 in the coma cluster ( abell 1656 ) , constructed from hst archive data . in all cases , the photometry reaches very similar depths in absolute magnitude and employs the same color indices , enabling homogeneous comparisons among all the systems . as in paper ii , our focus in this paper is on the metallicity and spatial distributions .    in section 2 a review of the literature for gc metallicity distributions",
    "is presented . in section 3 and 4",
    "the target galaxies and the photometric reductions are described .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams for the gc systems are presented in section 5 , and an analysis of the color ( metallicity ) distributions is presented in section 6 along with their notable galaxy - to - galaxy differences .",
    "the spatial distributions are discussed in section 7 . in sections 8 and 9",
    "we discuss some implications of our findings and a brief summary .",
    "our complete photometric data for the 5 bcgs discussed here and in paper ii can be obtained from the webpage address http://physwww.mcmaster.ca/  harris / bcgdata.html or by request to the first author .",
    "a particularly informative feature of globular cluster ( gc ) populations in galaxies is their _ metallicity distribution function _ ( mdf ) . in many galaxies ,",
    "a long - standing empirical feature of the mdf is its _ bimodal _ nature , with a canonical metal - poor ( mp ) `` blue '' sequence centered near @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath4 and a metal - rich ( mr ) `` red '' sequence near @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath5 .",
    "many authors have adopted the view that this two - part structure of the mdf is evidence for two major and perhaps distinct star - forming epochs in the formation histories of large galaxies , a view that has persisted for many years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "however , bimodal mdfs are not characteristic of the field - halo stars in their parent galaxies , in the few cases where it has been possible to compare the both gcs and halo stars directly in the same galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "reconciling this apparent mismatch between field stars and gcs presents an intriguing challenge for quantitative formation modelling .",
    "as is the case for all gc work , the origins of the topic start with the milky way .",
    "@xcite clearly established the bimodal nature of the milky way gc population , finding that the cluster metallicities coupled closely with systematically different kinematics and spatial distributions for the mp and mr subcomponents . gradually growing evidence for these two milky way subsystems had accumulated in earlier papers ( including among others * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but culminated in zinn s definitive analysis .    for distant galaxies ,",
    "spectroscopically measured gc metallicities are observationally far more time - consuming to build up , and probing the full three - dimensional kinematics of the halo is out of reach . instead ,",
    "gc integrated colors are commonly used as proxies for metallicity , since large samples of gcs can be efficiently measured this way .",
    "for very old and relatively simple stellar systems such as gcs , integrated color is sensitive only to metallicity while other factors such as mean age or cno abundances have only second- or third - order effects .",
    "the key empirical question is then how to convert the _ color distribution function _ ( cdf ) of a sample of gcs to its mdf and whether or not these different forms are measuring the same thing .",
    "the literature on this topic is extensive and continually developing , so a full synthesis is probably still premature .",
    "however , the issue seems to boil down to two central and only partially related questions :    1 .   for gc systems",
    ", is the mdf intrinsically bimodal ? 2 .",
    "does the cdf correctly represent the mdf shape after the appropriate transformation ?",
    "the answer to the first question , based strictly on spectroscopic evidence , now appears to be that bimodality is common but that there is no truly universal pattern . as has been emphasized elsewhere @xcite , spectroscopy of significant samples of gcs , in many galaxies ,",
    "is needed to go beyond the default assumption of bimodality confidently . the milky way gc system is clearly bimodal ( see the appendix of paper ii for a recent version of its mdf based on high - dispersion spectroscopy measures of [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "but several other galaxies now have gc metallicity data constructed from spectrum line strengths and for these , differing results emerge .    in m31 , the nearest large galaxy",
    ", the gc mdf displays a broad and more uniformly populated distribution that is less easily matched by a bimodal - gaussian form @xcite , which may reflect the complex and extended growth history of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "other large galaxies with well populated gc systems are rather well described by bimodal , spectroscopic mdfs : these include ngc 5128 @xcite , m81 @xcite , ngc 4472 @xcite , ngc 4594 @xcite , ngc 3115 @xcite , and 8 other large normal ellipticals @xcite .",
    "notable galaxy - to - galaxy differences appear in the degree of overlap between the mp and mr ` modes ' and their internal dispersions .",
    "spectroscopically based evidence for trimodality or simply a more uniform [ fe / h ] distribution is indicated for m87 @xcite , ngc 4494 @xcite , and perhaps ngc 4365 @xcite as well as m31 .",
    "the answer to the second question  how well the cdf represents the mdf  depends strongly on which color index is being used .",
    "many indices from near - uv through to near - ir have now been tested and compared .",
    "several discussions have claimed that a unimodal mdf is capable of being converted to a bimodal cdf if the transformation is sufficiently nonlinear ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a numerical exercise this claim is certainly true , though the continuing issue with these discussions is that they rely very heavily on single - stellar - population ( ssp ) theoretical modelling to develop translation curves from [ fe / h ] to a given color index .",
    "these model curves usually have quite complex shapes , and the various available ssp libraries show notable disagreements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , empirically based transformations from metallicity to color that do not rely heavily on modelling tend to be much more nearly linear and thus to yield cdfs that resemble the intrinsic mdfs rather well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ssp theoretical models , however , are useful for comparing the relative metallicity sensitivity and linearity of different color indices .",
    "the most effective ones include @xmath6 , or @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these indices combine high metallicity sensitivity with modest degrees of nonlinearity .",
    "however , a large fraction of the cdfs available in the literature have been measured in @xmath8 ( which is less sensitive to metallicity ) or @xmath9 ( which is more nonlinear than others listed above ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a diagnostic index that has gained more frequent use recently is the ca triplet line strength , which correlates near - linearly with [ fe / h ] in the range [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xcite . at the highest metallicities ,",
    "cat may become less sensitive , but any change in slope above [ fe / h ] @xmath11 will not be able to generate the intermediate - metallicity `` valley '' at [ fe / h ] @xmath12 between the normal mp and mr modes .",
    "interestingly , @xcite discuss evidence that different galaxies may have different color - to - metallicity conversions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite note that for a given galaxy , every color index should yield the same mdf if the transformations are correct .",
    "so far , applying this self - consistency test in practice has rarely been possible .",
    "a useful conclusion for the present seems to be that cdfs reflect the intrinsic shapes of the mdfs , if the color indices being used are chosen well .",
    "the extensive literature that reveals clearly bimodal cdfs for many galaxies therefore continues to be important ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "at the same time , some galaxies are better described as trimodal , unimodal , or simply broad without matching a simple gaussian - type model ( for specific examples , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a valid theoretical model for gc formation in the larger context of galaxy formation must be able to deal with this diversity of outcomes .    starting with either the cdf or mdf ,",
    "the first empirical question is simply to establish how many components or `` modes '' are present regardless of shape , and how similar these might be to the milky way ; or ( alternately ) whether or not a bimodal deconstruction is justified in the first place .",
    "the first mention of a _ specifically gaussian shape _ for these modes that we are aware of is in @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced a mixture - modelling numerical code ( the since - popular kmm package ) to make objective tests of unimodality ( the null hypothesis ) versus multimodality , using the cdfs for the two giant ellipticals ngc 4472 and 5128 as testbed cases .",
    "they concluded strongly that their cdfs are bimodal .",
    "a gaussian model was implicitly used for fitting the components , and , more or less by default , this quickly became the norm for later studies .",
    "just a few years later , the `` bimodal gaussian '' model was already rather firmly established in the literature of the subject ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .     versus @xmath13 for clusters in ngc 5128 .",
    "_ middle panel : _ @xmath14 versus @xmath15 for the same clusters .",
    "_ right panel : _ @xmath14 versus [ fe / h ] for the same clusters .",
    "the equations for the interpolation lines are given in the text : in the right panel , the solid line is for [ fe / h ] as the independent variable , and the dashed line for @xmath14 as the independent variable .",
    "equation ( 1 ) in the text lies in between the two.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig : gical ]    @xcite used various nonparametric tests to establish the gaussian bimodal form more strongly , though of necessity they were forced to work with the rather metallicity - insensitive color index @xmath8 that dominated the available data at the time .",
    "@xcite discuss different indicators of either gaussianity or bimodality within the context of their gmm fitting code , noting that a unimodal but asymmetric mdf will often favor a bimodal - gaussian fit .",
    "the bimodal - gaussian form continues to be widely used simply because it continues to match the cdfs and mdfs rather accurately in large numbers of galaxies of all types , sizes , and environments as the quality and internal precision of the data have steadily increased .",
    "nevertheless , there is not yet any _ a priori _ astrophysical reason to say that the mp and mr components should be specifically gaussian .",
    "gc formation models within the context of their parent galaxies are not yet advanced enough to make predictions for the shape of the mdf at that level of precision ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus the main purpose of these numerical model fits is to conveniently characterize the first - order features of the mdf : the mean metallicities of the modes ( however many there are ) , their widths ( intrinsic metallicity spread ) , and the metallicity separation between modes .    in the present survey of globular cluster systems in bcgs",
    ", we use the color index @xmath16 ( from here on we drop the accents on the sdss indices ) . in the following discussion",
    "it will be useful to have a calibration of this index versus cluster metallicity [ fe / h ] . to do this",
    ", we would ideally need to have gc photometry of the same clusters in both the kron - cousins and sdss systems , in addition to spectroscopically based metallicity measurements . at present , there are no ideal solutions to that problem .",
    "galaxies satisfying all three of these criteria are rare ; in principle the milky way gc databases could be used , but cluster - to - cluster foreground reddenings differ strongly , the published sdss indices @xcite show considerable scatter versus metallicity , and the variety of studies from which the @xmath17 indices were derived are completely different from the sdss survey , so aperture - size mismatches are significant .",
    "similar problems affect the m31 gc sample .",
    "the best option at the present time for developing a @xmath18 transformation is likely to be from the nearby early - type giant galaxy ngc 5128 : here , @xmath17 photometry is available from @xcite , @xmath19 photometry from @xcite , and [ fe / h ] values derived through @xmath7 from @xcite ; these [ fe / h ] values are in turn well correlated with the sloan - system spectroscopic index [ mgfe] ( see woodley et al . ) .",
    "we have extracted the gcs in common from these three catalogs , with the results shown in figure [ fig : gical ] .",
    "the great majority of these gcs lie well outside the central few kiloparsecs of ngc 5128 and thus are unaffected by the well known dust lane .",
    "we have therefore applied only the foreground reddening of the galaxy , for which we adopt @xmath20 @xcite to obtain the intrinsic colors .",
    "we note , however , that the @xmath17 measurements were done on @xmath21 aperture diameters corrected to @xmath22 through median curves of growth @xcite , while the @xmath19 measures were done through @xmath23 apertures @xcite , so a small aperture mismatch may exist here as well affecting the zeropoint of @xmath18 .",
    "the first two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : gical ] show the correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath24 versus @xmath14 .",
    "these correlations rely purely on the photometric data independently of [ fe / h ] estimates .",
    "simple linear relations derived from direct least - squares fits are @xmath25 the @xmath13 vs. @xmath14 relation is more tightly defined and valid over a wider range of colors than @xmath24 vs. @xmath14 .",
    "both @xmath26 and @xmath18 do well as metallicity indicators , but @xmath18 is a bit more sensitive and takes good advantage of the broadband hst filter system .",
    "the @xmath27 index is in turn slightly more sensitive than @xmath18 , but a noticeable nonlinearity remains between them .",
    "it should be noted again ( see above ) that the @xmath28 and @xmath29 photometric data come from two different observational programs and therefore do not have the internal homogeneity that would normally be desired , so any error in the zeropoint of the @xmath18 scale is hard to assess at present .",
    "fortunately , the slope and curvature of the relations are more important for the purposes here rather than the absolute values of [ fe / h ] .    the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gical ] connects @xmath14 with [ fe / h ] .",
    "a modestly nonlinear quadratic relation accounting for scatter in both axes is @xmath30 } + 0.045 { \\rm [ fe / h]}^2 \\,\\ ] ] which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gical]c .",
    "we recognize that this proposed calibration is only temporary ; in particular , the zeropoint depends on the accuracy of the separate zeropoints of @xmath28 and @xmath29 from two different observational programs and thus has a higher degree of uncertainty than usual .",
    "the conversion of @xmath18 to [ fe / h ] can be greatly solidified once larger numbers of high - quality spectroscopically based [ fe / h ] values become available for gc systems outside the local group particularly , where aperture - size corrections on the photometry become unimportant .",

    "in addition , self - enrichment in this model is highly nonlinear in cluster mass and thus it would predict that the slope @xmath142 should increase with gc mass , which is not observed in all cases . another and more physically based obstacle faced by internal self - enrichment is simply that it would require a fairly extended initial star formation period of @xmath14310 my for the first round of sneii to appear and contaminate the remaining gas in the protocluster , which could then go on to form more low - mass stars of higher metallicity ( see * ? ? ? * ) . but",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the high - mass regime suitable for gcs has , however , not yet been probed either in theory or observation : ideally we would like to determine the expected internal age range for young clusters at masses well above @xmath145 .",
    "it is potentially promising that in the recent @xcite models , cluster formation proceeds over @xmath146 my in some of the most massive cases .",
    "an alternate approach , though at this point still simplistic , would be to introduce _",
    "_ pre-__enrichment of the proto - gcs @xcite and invoke higher pre - enrichment for higher - mass clusters .",
    "different amounts of pre - enrichment among gcs , presumably drawn from their host giant molecular clouds , would in principle allow for a wider range of environmental influences .",
    "it is not yet clear , however , exactly how pre - enrichment should depend on gc mass .",
    "bcgs are likely to be products of mergers , and the sheer number of mergers could also have differed noticeably from one case to another .",
    "if we then assume that their progenitors experienced different levels of pre - enrichment before the formation of their mp clusters , then in general the mp sequence in the final combined bcg should have a higher internal color dispersion and a weaker net mmr slope in the cases where more mergers took place .",
    "in observational terms , @xmath147 should increase as @xmath142 decreases . some hints that this is the case can be seen from the comparison of ugc 9799 and ugc 10143 with the coma giants , from the numbers in table [ tab : gmm ] .",
    "it also remains unclear whether or not the mmr phenomenon is connected with the multiple stellar populations that have been detected within massive gcs in the milky way , an issue that continues to be a serious challenge for modelling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this limit is 0.12 mag fainter than the gclf peak ( paper i ) and thus should include 54% of the total over all luminosities assuming the gclf is gaussian in number per unit magnitude , and using the parameters from paper i. we therefore obtain @xmath189 for @xmath190 ( 110 kpc ) . integrating the light profile @xcite to the same radius",

    "if again we restrict the calculation conservatively to the acs field of view ( @xmath197 ) , the total number of gcs with @xmath198 is @xmath199 , which translates to @xmath200 over all magnitudes .",

    "we stress that this is a different issue than the one raised by @xcite , who proposed that an _ intrinsically unimodal mdf _ could be translated into the _ bimodal cdf _ seen in many galaxies because of the nonlinearity of the transformation ( in their case , specifically the @xmath27 index , which as noted above is among the most nonlinear of the indices in common use ) . here",
    ", we are essentially discussing the reverse : a cdf that is already smooth and unimodal can not have come from an intrinsically bimodal mdf , because @xmath220 [ fe / h ] is ( mildly ) nonlinear in the sense that it will produce a slightly more compressed mdf rather than one that is more spread out .",
    "the same argument would apply to any of the other color indices used in other papers such as @xmath221 , and others .",
    "the mdf we observe today is the visible outcome of a rapid sequence of individual gc - forming events that took place within many halos along a hierarchical merger tree . for a galaxy at the bcg scale ,",
    "thousands of such halos take part in this sequence at high redshift , each bringing in its own partially enriched gas . for a complex enough chain and a large enough number of halos",
    ", the end product might be expected to approach a continuous mdf , stretching from the most metal - poor gcs at an epoch where significant enrichment had not yet occurred , to the last major rounds of gc formation at roughly solar metallicity . in these supergiant cases ,",
    "it is evident that the merging halos over their full range of masses contained enough gas to form large numbers of gcs at every metallicity from [ fe / h ] @xmath222 up to above solar abundance , filling in every part of the mdf . at later times , individual accretions of small satellites",
    "continue that will add mostly to the metal - poor gc population in the outer halo .    rather than attempting to reverse -",
    "engineer the formation events from properties of the color distributions and radial distributions , ultimately it would be preferable to move forward from a physically based formation model to generate true model mdfs and gc spatial distributions which can then be compared with the observed cases .",
    "early steps in this direction include @xcite , though each of these uses particular simplifying prescriptions for the formation of gcs within the halos in the merger tree .",
    "nevertheless , for galaxies at the highest masses the outcome mdf in the models is broader and seen to approach a continuous distribution @xcite .",
    "an interesting result emerging from the bcgs , however , is that there are still notable differences in their mdfs even at these very highest galaxy masses . for m87 and ngc 4889 the mdfs",
    "still show a clearly bimodal form , while others ( ngc 4874 , ngc 6166 ) have mp and mr modes that have begun to merge , and in others ( ugc 9799 , ugc 10143 ) the mdf from the raw observations is smooth and unimodal , and the gmm - fitted @xmath85values fall below the threshold @xmath223 .",
    "nevertheless , in strict numerical terms a bimodal - gaussian deconstruction matches all these cases extremely well .",
    "we emphasize , however ( see again section 2 ) , that this model for the mdf is primarily a convenient description of its first - order features , emerging from what is intrinsically a continuous process of cluster formation .",
    "the overall appearance of the mdf is governed primarily by the internal dispersions @xmath224 of the mp and mr modes and thus the amount of overlap between the modes . by contrast",
    ", a near - uniform result we find is that the mp and mr mode centers @xmath88 in all the bcgs remain separated by very similar amounts @xmath225[fe / h ] @xmath226 dex , even though their dispersions may differ quite a lot .",
    "perhaps the most interesting feature is connected with the mp and mr relative numbers ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "these supergiants contain roughly equal numbers of mp and mr clusters , but there are still striking differences such as in ugc 10143 , where there are relatively few mr clusters at all radii , even in much of the inner region where the numbers of accreted mp clusters should have been small .",
    "this is , perhaps , an indication that the numbers of major gas - rich mergers from the big , metal - enriched halos that would have produced the metal - richer gcs may differ strongly between different bcgs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other possibilities are that by the time such mergers occurred the gas was already either largely converted to stars or heated to the point where less metal - rich gc formation could occur .",
    "our material strongly supports the identification of the metal - richer gcs with the halo light of their parent galaxies : their spatial distributions are similar in both radial and azimuthal distributions , and their overall spatial structure is consistently smoother and more regular than the mp clusters , like the galaxy light . subdividing the sample into the emp and emr subgroups helps to emphasize their distinctive spatial distributions .",
    "this material adds to to the similar evidence in other large galaxies ( see paper ii ) , pointing to the conclusion that the mr clusters formed along with the main stellar population of the galaxy .",
    "by contrast , the emp clusters consistently follow a distribution that in power - law terms @xmath228 is shallower by @xmath229 dex than the emr clusters , very different from the structure of the halo light and fairly close to an isothermal form similar to the dark - matter halos .",
    "the relation between gas metallicity and host galaxy mass ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests strongly that the mp gcs formed within small , very metal - poor dwarfs .",
    "these gcs could therefore have accumulated either extremely early in the hierarchical chain , before the major body of the galaxy had fully assembled ; or from accreted dwarf satellites that may come in at any later time . by contrast , the mr gcs should form within much bigger halos with more enriched gas .",
    "the importance of accretion in the buildup of the mdf that is observed today was first pointed out by @xcite and has frequently been discussed in the later literature ( for comprehensive recent discussions of the relative importance of accretions , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "the individual satellites may contribute both their own gcs and their stripped nuclei , which are structurally similar to luminous gcs .",
    "for example , @xcite calculate that almost 40% of the gcs in the core region of the virgo cluster around m87 may come from former satellites .",
    "a potentially related pattern that may be emerging from our bcg study is that the relative dominance of the mp clusters increases markedly beyond @xmath2 .",
    "this rough transition may mark the characteristic radius beyond which late accretions of metal - poor satellites dominate the gc population .",
    "continuing our series of studies of the extraordinarily rich globular cluster systems around brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) with the hst acs and wfc3 cameras , we present new comprehensive photometric analyses of the gc systems around ugc 9799 and ugc 10143 , along with comparison data for the coma supergiants ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 .",
    "our principal findings are these :    1 .",
    "the gc systems in all these galaxies are as expected extremely populous , yielding total populations of anywhere from 12000 to 23000 clusters within galactocentric radii @xmath231 kpc .",
    "extrapolation to larger radii might almost double those totals , though the presence of as - yet unknown numbers of intragalactic gcs will come into play there .",
    "the color distribution ( cdf ) of the gcs has been measured in the @xmath232 color index . in all the bcgs",
    "the cdf is broad , nominally unimodal , and skewed ( asymmetric ) .",
    "nevertheless , a simple bimodal - gaussian deconstruction continues to match the cdf very well , as it has for most smaller galaxies .",
    "the primary difference between these bcgs and smaller galaxies is that the intrinsic dispersions of the mp and mr modes become significantly higher , forcing the two modes to overlap heavily .",
    "the broad , near - continuous form of the cdf implies that the intrinsic metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) must also be broad and unimodal , because the transformation from color to metallicity is only slightly nonlinear and acts in the direction of making the mdf slightly more compressed than the cdf .",
    "4 .   of the four galaxies discussed here ,",
    "the coma giants ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 show a mass - metallicity relation ( mmr ) along the mp sequence , in the conventional sense that the blue sequence becomes systematically redder at higher luminosity .",
    "the heavy - element abundance scaling with gc mass is @xmath233 , which was also the case for ngc 6166 ( paper ii ) . for ugc 10143",
    ", no detectable trend shows up along either the red or blue sequences . for ugc 9799 ,",
    "the results are uncertain , with either a zero or positive slope along the blue sequence not ruled out",
    ". these results do not appear to support a simple self - enrichment model during gc formation , and instead may point to the need for some form of pre - enrichment in the most massive gcs driven by environmental differences at the time of formation .",
    "the relative numbers of mp and mr clusters within these supergiants differ significantly in detail , with at least one case ( ugc 10143 ) where the mp clusters dominate at all radii .",
    "this result suggests that the relative importance of gas - rich mergers with big , metal - enriched halos ( which built the mr clusters ) could have differed between bcgs .",
    "the ratio n(mp)/n(tot ) increases with radius in all these galaxies , particularly past @xmath2 .",
    "we suggest tentatively that this transition radius may mark the region outside which the mp clusters that came from late , discrete accretions of dwarf satellite galaxies are most important .",

    "<S> we present new deep photometry of the rich globular cluster ( gc ) systems around the brightest cluster galaxies ugc 9799 ( abell 2052 ) and ugc 10143 ( abell 2147 ) , obtained with the hst acs and wfc3 cameras . for comparison , we also present new reductions of similar hst / acs data for the coma supergiants ngc 4874 and 4889 . </S>",
    "<S> all four of these galaxies have huge cluster populations ( to the radial limits of our data , comprising from 12000 to 23000 clusters per galaxy ) . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) of the gcs can still be matched by a bimodal - gaussian form where the metal - rich and metal - poor modes are separated by @xmath0 dex , but the internal dispersions of each mode are so large that the total mdf becomes very broad and nearly continuous from [ fe / h ] @xmath1 to solar . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , significant differences between galaxies in the relative numbers of _ metal - rich _ clusters , suggesting that they underwent significantly different histories of mergers with massive , gas - rich halos . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , the proportion of metal - poor gcs rises especially rapidly outside projected radii @xmath2 , suggesting the importance of accreted dwarf satellites in the outer halo . </S>",
    "<S> comprehensive models for the formation of gcs as part of the hierarchical formation of their parent galaxies will be needed to trace the systematic change in structure of the mdf with galaxy mass , from the distinctly bimodal form in smaller galaxies up to the broad continuum that we see in the very largest systems . </S>"
