    "investigation on anisotropy of extremely high energy cosmic rays is one of the most important aspects to reveal their origin . in energies",
    "@xmath5 10@xmath0ev , cosmic rays slightly deflect in the galactic magnetic field if they are protons of galactic origin , so that one could observe the correlation of their arrival directions with the galactic structure . especially in the highest observed energy range ,",
    "correlation of cosmic rays with the local structure of galaxies may be expected if their origins are nearby astrophysical objects and the intergalactic magnetic field is less than 10@xmath6 gauss .    in the 1980 s , wdowczyk , wolfendale and their collaborators ( @xcite )",
    "have shown that excess of cosmic rays from the direction of the galactic plane increases systematically with energy until a little above 10@xmath0ev , though the available data was not statistically enough at that time .",
    "gillman and watson ( 1993 ) have summarized anisotropies in right ascension and galactic latitude combining the haverah park data set with the data sets from the arrays at volcano ranch ( @xcite ) , sydney ( @xcite ) and yakutsk ( @xcite ) .",
    "no convincing anisotropies were observed ; but large amplitude of the second harmonics at ( 4  8) @xmath1 10@xmath7ev was reported .",
    "ivanov ( 1998 ) showed , with the yakutsk data set , a north - south asymmetry in the galactic latitude distribution which is the southern excess with 3.5 @xmath8 deviation from an isotropic distribution in ( 5  20 ) @xmath1 10@xmath7ev .",
    "recently , we have shown a significant anisotropy with first harmonic amplitude of @xmath9 4 % in ( 0.8  2.0 ) @xmath1 10@xmath7ev , which corresponds to the chance probability of 0.2 % due to fluctuation of an isotropic distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "this anisotropy shows broad cosmic - ray flow from the directions of the galactic center and the cygnus regions . in the higher energies ,",
    "no significant large - scale anisotropy was found .",
    "bird et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown the galactic plane enhancement in the similar energy range .",
    "these experiments show that significant fraction of cosmic rays around 10@xmath7ev come from galactic sources .    in the much higher energy range",
    "@xmath10 4 @xmath1 10@xmath0ev , stanev et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have claimed that cosmic rays exhibit a correlation with the direction of the supergalactic plane and the magnitude of the observed excess is 2.5  2.8 @xmath8 in terms of gaussian probabilities .",
    "their result was mainly based on the haverah park data set . in the same energy range ,",
    "such large - scale correlation with the supergalactic plane was not observed in the data sets of the agasa ( @xcite ) , sugar ( @xcite ) and fly s eye ( @xcite ) experiments .",
    "however , agasa observed three pairs of cosmic rays above 4 @xmath1 10@xmath0ev within a limited solid angle of the experimental accuracy and the chance probability is 2.9 % if cosmic rays distribute uniformly in the agasa field of view .",
    "two out of three are located nearly on the supergalactic plane .",
    "if cosmic rays in each of these pairs come from the same source , the detailed study on energy , arrival time and direction distribution of these clusters may bring information on their source and the intergalactic magnetic field ( @xcite ) .    in the observed energy spectrum ,",
    "there are two distinctive energies : @xmath11 @xmath9 10@xmath0ev and 4 @xmath1 10@xmath0ev .",
    "the former is the energy where the spectral slope changes ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is interpreted as transition from galactic to extragalactic origin .",
    "the latter is the energy where the gzk effect ( @xcite ) , which is a series of energy loss through interaction with the cosmic microwave background photons , becomes important on their propagation from sources .",
    "it is important to study whether the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays changes at these energies .",
    "recent result of the agasa energy spectrum shows the extension beyond the expected gzk cutoff ( @xcite ) . since the distance to sources of cosmic rays above the expected gzk cutoff",
    "is limited to 50 mpc ( @xcite ) , their arrival directions may be correlated with luminous matter distribution if they are astrophysical source origin such as hot spots of radio galaxies ( @xcite ) , active galactic nuclei ( @xcite ) , accretion flow to a cluster of galaxies ( @xcite ) , relativistic shocks in gamma - ray bursts ( @xcite ) , and so on .",
    "there is another possibility that most energetic cosmic rays are generated through decay of supermassive `` x '' particles related to topological defects ( @xcite , reference therein ) . in this case ,",
    "arrival directions of most energetic cosmic rays are not necessarily associated with luminous matters .",
    "if such particles are the part of dark matter and are concentrated in the galactic halo , anisotropy associated with our galactic halo is expected ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",

    "the detectors are placed with a separation of about 1 km .",
    "they are controlled and operated from a central computer through optical fiber network .",
    "relative time difference among the detectors are measured with 40 nsec accuracy ; all clocks at detector sites are synchronized to the central clock and signal - propagation time in cables and electronic devices are regularly measured at start of each run ( twice a day ) .",

    "the fluctuation of the observation time on the local sidereal time is ( 0.2 @xmath15 0.1 ) % which is small enough compared with anisotropy in this energy range , so that the exposure ( observation time @xmath1 collection area ) in right ascension is quite uniform .",

    "this curve is consistent with the zenith angle dependence of the agasa exposure and considered to be the expected distribution if cosmic rays distribute isotropically on the celestial sphere . since the trigger efficiency is independent of energy above 10@xmath0ev and zenith angle less than 45@xmath3 , this distribution is applied to in higher energies .",

    "one triplet and three doublets are found and the probability of observing these clusters by a chance coincidence is smaller than 1 % . especially the triplet is observed against expected 0.05 events . out of these clusters , the c2 ( agasa triplet ) and c1 ( doublet including the agasa highest energy event or triplet together with the haverah park 10@xmath2ev event ) clusters are most interesting ; they are triplets found in the world data sets and are located near the supergalactic plane .",
    "one should wait for the further high - rate observation to distinguish whether the members of clusters come from a single source or different sources .",
    "the @xmath4 distribution expected from the dark matter halo model fits the data as well as an isotropic distribution above 2 @xmath1 10@xmath0ev and 4 @xmath1 10@xmath0ev , but is a poorer fit than isotropy above 10@xmath0ev .",
    "the arrival direction distribution of the 10@xmath2ev cosmic rays is consistent with that of cosmic rays with lower energies and is uniform .",
    "it is noteworthy that three of seven 10@xmath2ev cosmic rays are members of doublets .",
    "the bc1 cluster is in the direction of the cygnus loop or psr 2053@xmath5336 region .",
    "it is desirable to examine any signals from this direction in other energy band around mjd 50,000 .",
