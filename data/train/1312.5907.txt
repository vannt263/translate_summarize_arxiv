    "while the minor theorem of robertson and seymour  @xcite shows that the set of all graphs is well - quasi - ordered under the minor relation , it is well known that this set is not well - quasi - ordered under the induced subgraph order .",
    "consequently , there has been considerable interest in determining which classes of graphs are well - quasi - ordered under this order . here",
    "we consider finite graphs and permutation graphs which omit both a path @xmath4 and a clique @xmath5 .",
    "our main result , proved in section  [ sec - p5-kell ] , is that permutation graphs which avoid both @xmath0 and a clique @xmath5 are well - quasi - ordered under the induced subgraph order for every finite @xmath6 .",
    "we also prove , in section  [ sec - p7 ] , that the three classes of permutation graphs defined by forbidding @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively are not well - quasi - ordered , by exhibiting an infinite antichain in each case .",
    "we begin with elementary definitions .",
    "we say that a _ class _ of graphs is a set of graphs closed under isomorphism and taking induced subgraphs .",
    "a class of graphs is _ well - quasi - ordered ( wqo ) _ if it contains neither an infinite strictly decreasing sequence nor an infinite antichain ( a set of pairwise incomparable graphs ) under the induced subgraph ordering .",
    "note that as we are interested only in classes of finite graphs , wqo is synonymous with a lack of infinite antichains .    given a permutation @xmath7 , its corresponding _ permutation graph _",
    "is the graph @xmath8 on the vertices @xmath9 in which @xmath10 is adjacent to @xmath11 if both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this mapping is many - to - one , because , for example , @xmath14 . given permutations @xmath15 and @xmath7 , we say that @xmath16 is _ contained _ in @xmath17 and write @xmath18 if there are indices @xmath19 such that the sequence @xmath20 is in the same relative order as @xmath16 . for us ,",
    "a _ class _ of permutations is a set of permutation closed downward under this containment order , and a class is wqo if it does not contain an infinite antichain .",
    "the mapping @xmath21 is easily seen to be _ order - preserving _ ,",
    "i.e. , if @xmath18 then @xmath22 is an induced subgraph of @xmath8 . therefore if a class @xmath23 of permutations is wqo then the associated class of permutation graphs @xmath24 must also be wqo .",
    "however , it is possible to exploit the many - to - one nature of this mapping to construct infinite antichains of permutations which do not correspond to antichains of permutation graphs ( though currently there are no examples of this in the literature ) .",
    "for this reason , when showing that classes of permutation graphs are wqo we instead prove the stronger result that the associated permutation classes are wqo , but when constructing infinite antichains , we must construct antichains of permutation graphs .",

    "graphs avoiding @xmath25 are trivially wqo and graphs avoiding @xmath26 ( co - graphs ) are well - known to be wqo , so there are only two nontrivial results , namely graphs avoiding @xmath27 and @xmath0 or @xmath28 .",
    "of course , it suffices to show that @xmath29-free graphs are wqo , and this was recently proved by atminas and lozin  @xcite .",
    "on the side of non - wqo , two infinite antichains are required : one ( from  @xcite ) in the class of graphs with neither @xmath0 ( or even @xmath30 ) nor @xmath31 , and one ( from  @xcite ) in the class omitting both @xmath32 and @xmath27 . for completeness",
    ", we outline both constructions here .    for graphs which omit @xmath0 and @xmath31 , korpelainen and lozin  @xcite construct an infinite antichain by adapting a correspondence between permutations and graphs due to ding  @xcite .",
    "the correspondence we require for our antichain can be described as follows , and is accompanied by figure  [ fig - ding - antichain ] . for a permutation @xmath17 of length @xmath33 , first note that @xmath17 can be thought of as a structure with @xmath33 points , equipped with two linear orderings .    with this in mind , form a graph @xmath34 which consists of three independent sets , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , each containing @xmath33 vertices .",

    "this defines a second linear ordering on @xmath35 , namely @xmath45 , and hence @xmath17 has been encoded in @xmath34 .",
    "finally , to complete the construction , between @xmath36 and @xmath37 there is a complete bipartite graph , i.e. , every edge is present .",

    "moreover for permutations @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we have @xmath47 if and only if @xmath48 as induced subgraphs .",
    "thus , one may take any infinite antichain of permutations ( for example , the `` increasing oscillating '' antichain ) , and encode each element of the antichain as a graph , yielding an infinite antichain in the class of @xmath30 , @xmath31-free graphs .    for graphs which omit @xmath32 and @xmath27 ,",
    "a modification of this construction was used by  @xcite to answer a question of ding  @xcite , who had asked whether @xmath32-free bipartite graphs are wqo . starting with @xmath34 , the modification `` splits '' every vertex @xmath49 of @xmath35 into two , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with an edge between them .",
    "the new vertex @xmath50 takes the neighbourhood of @xmath49 with @xmath36 , while @xmath51 takes the neighbourhood of @xmath49 with @xmath37 .",

    "before establishing our main result we must first introduce these concepts .",
    "we frequently identify a permutation @xmath17 of length @xmath33 with its _ plot _ , the set @xmath58 of points in the plane .",

    "@xmath69-gridding _ of the permutation @xmath17 of length @xmath33 consists of a pair of sequences @xmath72 and @xmath73 such that for all @xmath74 and @xmath6 , the entries of ( the plot of ) @xmath17 that lie in the axis - parallel rectangle @xmath75 are increasing if @xmath76 , decreasing if @xmath77 , or empty if @xmath78 .",

    "monotone griddable _ if there is a finite matrix @xmath69 for which it is @xmath69-griddable .",
    "grid classes were first described in this generality ( albeit under a different name ) by murphy and vatter  @xcite , who studied their wqo properties . to describe their result",
    "we need the notion of the _ cell graph _ of a matrix @xmath69 .",
    "this graph has vertex set @xmath81 and @xmath82 is adjacent to @xmath83 if they lie in the same row or column and there are no nonzero entries lying between them in this row or column .",
    "we typically attribute properties of the cell graph of @xmath69 to @xmath69 itself ; thus we say that @xmath69 is a forest if its cell graph is a forest .",

    "( this is a slightly different form of the result than is stated in @xcite , but the two forms are equivalent as shown by vatter and waton  @xcite , who also gave a much simpler proof of theorem  [ thm - murphy - vatter ] . )",
    "the monotone griddable classes were characterised by huczynska and vatter  @xcite . in order to present this result",
    "we also need some notation .",
    "given permutations @xmath16 and @xmath84 of respective lengths @xmath85 and @xmath33 , their _ sum _ is the permutation @xmath86 whose plot consists of the plot of @xmath84 above and to the right of the plot of @xmath16 .",
    "more formally , this permutation is defined by @xmath87 the obvious symmetry of this operation ( in which the plot of @xmath84 lies below and to the right of the plot of @xmath16 ) is called the _ skew sum _ of @xmath16 and @xmath84 and is denoted @xmath88 .",
    "we can now state the characterisation of monotone griddable permutation classes .",

    "the reader might note that the classes we are interested in are not monotone griddable , let alone @xmath69-griddable for a forest @xmath69 .",
    "however , our proof will show that these classes can be built from a monotone griddable class via the `` substitution decomposition '' , which we define shortly . before this , though , we must introduce a few more concepts concerning monotone grid classes , the first two of which are alternative characterisations of monotone griddable classes .    given a permutation @xmath17 , we say that the axis - parallel rectangle @xmath91 is _ monotone _ if the entries of @xmath17 which lie in @xmath91 are monotone increasing or decreasing ( otherwise @xmath91 is _ non - monotone _ ) .",
    "we say that the permutation @xmath17 can be _ covered by @xmath92 monotone rectangles _ if there is a collection @xmath93 of @xmath92 monotone axis - parallel rectangles such that every point in the plot of @xmath17 lies in at least one rectangle in @xmath93 . clearly if @xmath80 for a @xmath70 matrix @xmath69 then every permutation in @xmath23 can be covered by @xmath94 monotone rectangles . to see the other direction , note that every permutation which can be covered by @xmath92 monotone rectangles is @xmath69-griddable for some matrix @xmath69 of size at most @xmath95 .",
    "there are only finitely many such matrices , say @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , so their _ direct sum _ , @xmath99 is a finite matrix whose grid class contains all such permutations.by adapting this argument it follows that if every permutation in the class @xmath23 lies in the grid class of a forest of size at most @xmath70 , then @xmath23 itself lies in the grid class of a ( possibly much larger ) forest . ]    this characterisation of monotone griddability is recorded in proposition  [ prop - mono - rectangles ] below , which also includes a third characterisation .",
    "we say that the line @xmath100 _ slices _ the rectangle @xmath91 if @xmath101 . if @xmath80 for a @xmath70 matrix then for every permutation @xmath102 there is a collection of @xmath103 horizontal and vertical lines ( the grid lines ) which slice every non - monotone axis - parallel rectangle of @xmath17 .",
