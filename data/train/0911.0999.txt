    "accretion powered x - ray binaries are the brightest x - ray sources in our galaxy .",

    "20 have reliable mass estimates and are , therefore , regarded as confirmed black holes while the remaining 20 are considered to be black hole candidates ( remillard and mcclintock 2006a ) .",
    "a majority of the black hole binaries ( bhbs ) are transients and most of them have a low mass optical companion . + the black hole x - ray binaries have several distinctive x - ray characteristics . during the outburst there is a strong soft component that originates in the inner region of the hot accretion disk .",
    "the presence of a hard x - ray component in energy spectra is another common feature of black hole binaries .",
    "the hard x - rays arise through compton scattering of low energy photons from the accretion disk in a hot optically thin plasma .",

    "spectral and temporal characteristics of the sources vary from one state to another .",
    "remillard and mcclintok ( 2006a ) have broadly classified the spectral state for bhb as ( a ) high or soft state ( hs ) dominated by the thermal component , ( b ) low or hard state ( lh ) marked by the hard x - ray power law and ( c ) steep power law ( spl ) or very high state characterized by steep slope power law component . for a more complete description of the spectral states",
    "mcclintock and remillard ( 2006 ) included two more states namely an intermediate state ( i m ) that occurs when the source moves from lh to hs state and an extreme lh state which they called as quiescent state .",
    "gierlinski , done and page ( 2008 ) have included an additional state termed as ultra soft state ( us ) which is an extreme case of high / soft state found in this source .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that the qpo frequency is related to the dynamical time scale of the blobs and therefore , the lfqpos observed by us in the 4.4 - 5.9 hz from xte j1817 - 330 will originate farther out in the accretion disk . in the outer region , the compton scattering corona will be relatively cooler and the qpo amplitude will decrease with increasing energy . in our case",
    "we have detected a marginal increase in the amplitude of the qpos at the higher energy in the two observations , a decrease in the amplitude in the other two observations and no change in amplitude in one case .",
    "this suggests that the site of qpo generation is itself dynamically varying in xte j1817 - 330 due to variation in the x - ray luminosity which in turn depends on the accretion rate .",
    "+ we have detected the qpos in the 8 - 14 kev band but not in the 2 - 8 kev for the observations of mjd 53790.2 and 53790.3 .",
    "this is similar to the detection of the qpos at the high energy and its absence at the low energy in some observations from grs 1915 + 105 ( chakraborti and manickam 2000 ) .",
    "this behavior of grs 1915 + 105 was explained by chakrabarti and manickam ( 2000 ) on the basis of `` on '' and `` off '' ( burst and quiescent ) state of the source with the shock oscillation model .",
    "further detailed studies of the lfqpos at the higher energy are required to test the validity of the model .",
    "the authors thank nasa / gsfc based high energy astrophysics science archive research center for making rxte - pca data available on - line .",
    "we are extremely thankful to an anonymous referees for his critical and constructive comments and suggestions that vastly improved the content and presentation of this paper .",
