    "the fascinating properties of single layer graphene ( ge ) have triggered a broad interest in the solid state physics community  @xcite . despite its high electron mobility  @xcite",
    ", the zero band gap defies its employment in nano transistors where it is desirable to have a large on - off ratio between conducting and non - conducting states .",
    "a band gap can be induced by the addition of adatoms , which changes locally the hybridization of the carbon ( c ) atoms , but also modifies the electron mean free - path affecting the electron transport properties .",
    "hydrogen ( h ) and fluor ( f ) are two well tested candidates  @xcite that leads to a large band gap opening .",
    "graphane ( ga , hydrogenated graphene ) and fluorographene ( fg ) have been studied both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite to engineer the band gap .    when h or f atoms are attached to the c atoms of ge , the bonds transit from an _",
    "sp@xmath2 _ to an _",
    "hybridization , which turns the conjugated graphitic c - c bonds into single c - c bonds . in the fully covered cases both ga and fg are insulating materials  @xcite and the structure changes locally the planar shape of ge into an angstrom scale out - of - plane buckled shaped membrane  @xcite known as _ chair configuration _  @xcite",
    ".    from its potential applications in nanotechnology , fg is a more favourable material than ga since the c - f bonds are energetically more stable than the c - h bonds  @xcite .",
    "fluorographene has a very large temperature - dependent resistance and when the fluor content is increased it induces large changes in the electron transport  @xcite . as in ge",
    ", it is expected that temperature also affects strongly the lattice structure and the mechanical properties of fg .",
    "according to the mermin - wagner theorem ,  @xcite , thermal excited ripples in two dimensional - like materials ( ge , bilayer ge , ga and fg ) has to play an important role in the stability of the membrane . while in ge and bilayer ge the corrugations",
    "are well described within the theory of two dimensional continuous membranes  @xcite , for ga instead , we recently found that the angstrom scale buckling of the carbon layer of ga prevents the formation of intrinsic long wavelength thermal ripples for temperatures up to at least 900 @xmath4  @xcite . since the c atom has a higher ( lower ) electronegativity than h ( f ) , it will take ( give ) away charge from the h ( f ) atom and consequently transforms the resulting c - h and c - f covalent bonds into sp@xmath3 bonds .",
    "therefore , it is expected that similar rippling effects as in ga will occur in fg although the c - f bonds are somewhat stronger than the c - h bonds .",
    "the latter is due to the larger amount of charge that is shifted from c to f as compared to the one from h to c  @xcite .",
    "however in order to simulate large scale fg samples an appropriate force field is needed which describes the true chemical bond in c - f .",
    "indeed , the absent of such a suitable interatomic potential for c - f restricted most of the recent studies to ab - initio calculations of their electronic properties using a small computational unit cell .",
    "reaxff potential serves to describe both bond and non - bond interactions in solids .",
    "recently , such potentials were parameterized and were well tested for different kind of structures , e.g. hydrocarbons  @xcite , carbon allotropes  @xcite , etc . in this study",
    "we present a new set of parameters for reaxff , appropriate for structures with c - f bonds . using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations over large scale samples we study the thermal corrugations of fg and compare the results with those found for ga , ge and bn .",
    "we show that fully covered fg follows the same trend as ga and does not develop long - wavelength ripples or significant corrugation . the bending rigidity @xmath5 of fg is found to be larger than the one of ge , ga and bn .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 turns out to be temperature independent .",
    "our results indicate that long - wavelength ripples are instead present in partial covered fg samples with a larger amplitude as compared to ga .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a new set of parameters for the reaxff potential of the c - f covalent bond . then , in sec .",
    "iii using the introduced parameters , we analyze the thermal rippling behavior . here , we consider both fully and partially covered graphene sheets by f atoms .",
    "all the results are compared with those previously found for graphane .",
    "we also estimate the effective young s modulus of fg flakes .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "reaxff  @xcite is a general bond - order dependent potential that uses a relationship between bond distance and bond order on the one hand and a relationship between bond order and bond energy on the other hand to describe bond formation and dissociation .",
    "many body interactions such as the valence angle and torsional interactions are formulated as function of bond order so that their energy contributions vanish smoothly upon bond dissociation .",
    "non bonded interactions , namely coulomb and van der waals interactions , are calculated between every pair of atoms irrespective of their connectivity .",
    "excessively close range interactions are avoided by shielding .",
    "reaxff uses the geometry dependent charge calculation scheme ( eem scheme ) of mortier   _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "the system energy in reaxff consists of a sum of terms : @xmath6 a detailed description of each of these terms and their functional forms can be found in the original work  @xcite .",
    "the reactive force field for c / f containing systems was developed by parameterizing the potential against dft data obtained at the b3lyp/6 - 31 g * * level of theory ( which is implemented in schrodinger  @xcite which is an electronic structure packages ) for various quantities such as fluorine and carbon atom charges in h@xmath7c@xmath8cf@xmath9ch@xmath7 , c@xmath8f and c@xmath8c bond lengths in h@xmath7c@xmath8cf@xmath9ch@xmath7 and h@xmath7c@xmath8cf(ch@xmath7)@xmath8ch@xmath7 , f@xmath8f bond length in the f@xmath10 molecule , potential energy curve for c - f bond dissociation in h@xmath7c@xmath8cf@xmath9ch@xmath7 , f - c - f angle bending in h@xmath7c@xmath8cf@xmath9ch@xmath7 , c - c - f angle bending in h@xmath7c@xmath8cf@xmath9ch@xmath7 and f - c - c - f dihedral twisting in f@xmath10c@xmath11cf@xmath10 along with various chemical reactions involving fluoroalkanes and fluoroalkenes . the results of the force field training are presented in figs .  [ reaxff2](a)-(d ) and in table  [ tablerexff ] .",
    "[ figreaxff ] depicts the geometrical quantities relevant to figs .",
    "[ reaxff2](a)-(d ) .",
    "it can be seen from table  [ tablerexff ] that reaxff reproduces closely the dft based equilibrium geometries for various compounds .",
    "reaxff predicts f@xmath10 dissociation energy of 36.6 kcal / mol , in very good agreement with the dft value of 37 kcal / mol .",
    "[ reaxff2](a ) shows that reaxff based potential energy curve for the c - f bond dissociation in h@xmath7c@xmath8cf@xmath9ch@xmath7 closely follows the dft based potential energy curve .",
    "reaxff is able to predict very precisely the equilibrium c - f bond length ( see table  [ tablerexff ] ) and the c - f bond dissociation energy .",
    "similarly the force field can closely reproduce the dft based potential energy curve and the equilibrium geometry ( see table  [ tablerexff ] ) for c - c - f angle bending and the c - f - c angle bending as shown in figs .",
    "[ reaxff2](b)-(c ) .",
    "figure  [ reaxff2](d ) shows the variation of the potential energy upon f - c - c - f dihedral angle twisting .",
    "though reaxff predicts the correct trend , the torsional rotation barrier in reaxff is around 18 kcal / mol lower than that predicted by dft .",
    "overall , the reaxff force field for c / f systems can closely reproduce the dft based energies and geometries for a number of molecules and reactions .",
    "this force field will now be employed in large scale fully reactive molecular dynamics simulation of c / f containing systems .    in the next section we study the thermal structural fluctuations and mechanical properties of a single layer of fg using large scale atomistic simulations employing the presented reaxff parameters .",
    "these parameters were implemented in the large - scale atomic / molecular massively parallel simulator package lammps  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     density functional calculations for band structure of fg ( and ga )  @xcite shows that the acoustic out - of - plane modes ( za ) in fg ( and ga ) are different from that of ge .",
    "the most important difference from ge is the decoupled optical and acoustic bands in fg and ga close to the @xmath12 point .",
    "the light h atom contributes to the highest phonon frequencies which is not the case for f atoms .",
    "it is also seen that the za modes close to the @xmath12 point for fg ( and ga ) are not well fitted by a quadratic function in contrast to the ge case .",
    "this is clear indication of anharmonicity . in summary , the atomistic details of the structure of fg",
    "is more complicated and therefore more details of this structure should be included in any continuum theory .    before ending this section , note that as we discussed in our previous work  @xcite , the scaling with the system size present in ge is no longer valid for fg and ga ( @xmath13 in fg and ga is almost constant irrespective to the system size ) .",
    "the lower wavelengths ( @xmath14 ) adopted for the calculation of @xmath1 are equal to @xmath15 and @xmath16 and represent the computational cut - offs of possible large wavelength ripples where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the dimension of the system .",
    "notice that deviation from the harmonic behavior takes place at larger value of @xmath14 and hence this effect can not be a finite size effect and is instead an intrinsic phenomenon of the material .      in order to study the mechanical stiffness we consider an fg flake with dimension @xmath19nm@xmath2 . before the stretching process",
    ", the sample is equilibrated for 5 ps ( i.e. 50,000 time steps ) .",
    "stretching direction is always along @xmath20 and the uniaxial strain is applied within the npt ensemble  @xcite where the pressure is slowly increased , i.e. 2gpas / ps . in this section the lateral edges ( in the @xmath21 direction )",
    "were taken as the arm - chair direction having both free ( fbc ) and periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "we kept temperature fixed at t=10k .",
    "the total strain energy per atom of the strained flake can be written as a function of the imposed strain ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy of the infinite planar undeformed flake , @xmath25 is the excess edge energy , and @xmath26 is young s modulus ( @xmath26 ) of the flake .    for nano - ribbons with no lateral edges we have @xmath27 ( assuming that the longitudinal edges which are fixed make no contribution ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that free edges increase the energy due to buckling and bond - order changes  @xcite .",
    "recently lu _ et al _ used the brenner potential  @xcite in molecular dynamics simulations and studied the excess edge energy of graphene nano - ribbons as a function of width and chirality  @xcite .",
    "our systems are different from those of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite we are not interested in effects due to the edge energy effect and the size dependence .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ estrain ] ) in the following as an effective young s modulus which qualitatively gives a good description of the mechanical stiffness of all the examined 2d materials .",
    "nevertheless our results are in qualitative agreement with those reported by lu  _ at al _ , i.e. increasing of total energy for the fbc case as compared to a nano - ribbon . assuming a quadratic relation for @xmath28 valid for small @xmath22 , the simplest method to estimate young s modulus is by fitting the quadratic function to the total energy ( per area ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the effective young s modulus of the system .",
    "using aforementioned fitting process we found @xmath30 respectively for a flake with arm - chair and zig - zag fg , to be 273 n / m and 250 n / m . notice that the experimental result is 100 n / m for not perfect fg  @xcite while the dft result is 250 n / m  @xcite .",
    "the latter disagreement between theory and experiment may be explained due to the fact that in experimental samples the fluor - to - carbon ratio is larger than unity , i.e.  1.1  @xcite , because of the presence of defects .",
    "such defects become active regions which can adsorb the free f ( and even h ) atoms . therefore , in the defected parts more f atoms will be found which is responsible for a f / c ratio larger than one .    in order to understand the effect of the different boundary conditions , we depict in fig .",
    "[ fige ] the variation of @xmath31 per atom with @xmath22 for flakes with both fbc ( dashed lines ) and pbc , i.e. nano - ribbon ( solid lines ) .",
    "it is seen that for flakes with fbc the free edges result in an increase of the energy .",
    "the inset shows the difference between two curves , i.e. @xmath32 which is positive . because the free boundaries have many dangling bonds which are not saturated by f atoms it results in extra energy",
    "this can also occur in other systems , e.g. graphene  @xcite . notice that for the studied low temperature here , i.e. t=10k we do not expect that bond reconstruction at the edges is important . notice that even by saturating all the bonds by f , still the change in the bond order term in reaxff ( due to different chemical environment of the boundary atoms ) results in higher energy as compared to pbc .",
    "furthermore , both fbc and pbc results exhibit a quadratic behavior which is an indication of the harmonic regime for the applied uniaxial stain .",
    "as is clear from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fige ] , the difference between the two curves is increasing with applied strain .",
    "this is due to the deviation from equilibrium for the c - f bonds , c - c - f ( f - c - f ) bond angles , and the dihedral angles ( f - c - c - f torsion angle ) of the free edge atoms .",
    "the larger the strain ( and the larger the length of ribbon ) , the larger the deviation from equilibrium for the bonds and the angles . in the pbc case",
    "there is no such edge effect but nevertheless because of the fixing of the two longitudinal ends ( the edges which are under uniaxial stress ) the energy variation of the pbc system should be different from that of an infinite fg which is periodic in both directions while it is under tension from the arm - chair direction . the fixed longitudinal ends do not have any effect in our results because both fbc and pbc have the same contributions .",
    "we provided a new set of parameters for the reaxff potential for the c - f covalent bond and tested it on various molecules .",
    "subsequently , molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the thermal rippling behavior and the mechanical response of fluorographene ( fg ) under uniaxial stress .",
    "the obtained results are compared with those for graphene ( ge ) , graphane ( ga ) and hexagonal boron nitride sheet ( bn ) . we found that fluorographene remains a flat sheet similar to graphane even at high temperature , i.e. up to 900 k. the bending rigidity of fg is found to be independent of temperature and its young s modulus is in good agreement with experiment .    _",
