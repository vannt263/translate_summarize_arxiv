    "since the discovery of a scalar boson with mass @xmath6126 gev , at the lhc in 2012 @xcite , the standard model ( sm ) picture may have been completed . indeed , if this scalar particle corresponds to the sm higgs boson , the sm could be the correct description of nature up to scales close to the planck mass .",
    "so far , all the experimental evidence seems to be pointing in the direction of confirming that it is really the missing piece of the sm puzzle .",
    "nevertheless the exploration of features of this particle is just beginning and further studies are needed to confirm its identity .    from now on , our efforts to probe the sm and to search for physics beyond it may follow two complementary paths : i ) push the energy frontier in the search for new particles and interactions and ii ) increase the precision on the couplings of the first ( so far ) fundamental scalar ever discovered .",
    "indirect searches , which would include the latter path , searches of rare processes or higher order corrections to low energy couplings , have been very successful in the past and have led to the discovery of new particles such as the third generation quarks .",
    "they have also been instrumental in exploring the scale of new physics beyond the collider reach .    in the case of the higgs boson",
    ", the study of its couplings can be the way to go .",
    "scrutinizing non - standard higgs couplings is a way to test the presence of additional scalar bosons even when their direct production is closed . in the models beyond the sm in which there exists more than one higgs doublet , as in a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm)@xcite or the mssm @xcite , the couplings of the candidate for the discovered scalar boson may not be flavour diagonal and thus it can have flavour changing decays @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these flavour changing couplings are dimensionless and therefore the effects of additional heavy particles may not decouple even when the masses of such particles are taken to infinity , providing a unique opportunity to find an assuring indirect evidence for such a high scale non - easily accessible in the near future .",
    "even more , as we have no clue of the new energy scale ( if any ) associated with the new particles and interactions we are looking for , considering rare higgs decays is a wise way to go .",
    "thus , our proposal consists of searching for the flavour - changing ( fc ) higgs decays . in the sm",
    "these fc decays do not exist and therefore their presence would undoubtedly signal the presence of new physics beyond the sm .    as mentioned before , in the past",
    ", rare decays , including processes like @xmath7 and @xmath8 , have been extensively used to search for new physics .",
    "their precise experimental measurements were useful for the exploration of the parameter space of different sm extensions .",
    "likewise , fc higgs decays are very useful to search for new physics since they are present in almost any extension of the sm containing additional scalars that mix with the lighter higgs .",
    "for instance they are unavoidable in type - ii 2hdms , like the mssm , pseudo - dilaton models @xcite , models with extra dimensions @xcite or composite higgs models @xcite . to be specific , in this work we will explore a generic supersymmetric scenario , as well as the mssm framework , both in the presence of non - minimal flavour structures .    our analysis will be focused on the process @xmath9 , since one would expect on general grounds that , among fc higgs decays , those involving third generation particles whose yukawa couplings are larger are the most experimentally accessible . besides , loop - induced fc processes in the quark sector are typically larger by a factor @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the coupling constants associated to the groups @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively ) for similar flavour changing entries in the lepton sector .",
    "the main goal in this analysis is to find out the largest fc branching ratios for the different higgs states attainable in a general supersymmetric scenario .",
    "as we will show , in the mssm , the decoupling of the heavy higgses , enforced by present constraints , makes the fc branching ratio ( br ) of the observed light - higgs to be below the level of @xmath15 , while heavy higgs states could reach @xmath16 . in a more general supersymmetric standard model ,",
    "the light higgs br could still reach values of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , these rare decays are very challenging for the lhc but they can be searched for at lepton colliders as the international linear collider ( ilc ) . as will be shown , the branching ratio can reach a level of @xmath18 under special circumstances in the generic susy case . these branching ratios could be reached at a linear collider . in fact , we can see that already at lep , a limit of br@xmath19 was obtained with only @xmath20 @xmath21-bosons in ref .",
    "we can expect the larger statistics and improved experimental techniques to improve these limits ( see also @xcite ) . in the case of",
    "the higgs decays , we can produce between @xmath22 and @xmath20 higgs bosons for @xmath23 gev @xcite , and therefore we can expect similar values for the lightest higgs branching ratio .",
    "thus , fc higgs decays may provide an indirect hint for the existence of new physics at higher energies even when these higher scales are beyond the lhc or ilc reach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : fc ] , we introduce the framework in which the analysis will be carried out .",
    "some compelling variations of it will also be addressed because of their interest when trying to observe fc processes . still in this section ,",
    "the theoretical expressions for the fc higgs decays into down - type quarks will be provided .",
    "section [ sec : exconstr ] summarizes the latest experimental data corresponding to collider probes and indirect bounds from low - energy experiments .",
    "finally , section [ sec : numanalysis ] collects the main features of the numerical analysis , concluding in section [ sec : conclusions ] with the main results .",
    "our analysis is performed within a generic cp - violating mssm framework and its extensions , in which the minimal higgs sector is a type - ii 2hdm , _ i.e. _ one of the two scalar doublets couples only to the up - type quarks at tree - level while the other couples only to down - type quarks . when electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) occurs , the neutral components of the two higgs fields acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) and five physical higgs states appear : three with neutral electric charge and two charged bosons .",
    "the two higgs doublets can be parameterized as @xmath24 where @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 gev . at tree level the mass eigenstates ( @xmath29 )",
    "are cp eigenstates , but this situation changes once loop corrections are taken into account @xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "the possibility of having cp - violating phases increases due to the growing number of complex parameters in the so - called soft susy breaking terms , and indeed these cp phases contribute at loop - level to higgs masses and mixings .",
    "consequently , weak - state fields ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) give rise to cp - mixed mass eigenstates ( @xmath29 ) and these states are related through a unitary transformation represented by the @xmath32 orthogonal mixing matrix @xmath33 : @xmath34 the mass eigenvalues will be obtained by means of diagonalising the mass squared matrix : @xmath35 to study higgs flavour changing decays , it is helpful to introduce a convenient parametrization of the higgs mixings . during the analysis ,",
    "we will use @xmath36 where @xmath37 quantifies the distance of the lightest higgs mixings from @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 is directly related to the pseudoscalar content of @xmath1 .    in our analysis",
    "below , we will distinguish two different situations in regard to the higgs mixing :    * full mssm framework : here , we consider the usual mssm higgs potential @xcite which breaks the electroweak symmetry radiatively .",
    "the minimization of this potential gives us the higgs masses and mixings .",
    "+ using @xmath41 , one may express the mixing angles @xmath42 in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath40 as follows @xmath43\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ \\mathcal{o}_{21}&=&\\sin\\beta\\left [ \\sqrt{1-(\\delta_1 ^ 2+\\eta_1 ^ 2)\\cos^2\\beta\\sin^2\\beta } -\\delta_1\\cos^2\\beta \\right]\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ \\mathcal{o}_{31}&=&\\eta_1\\,\\cos\\beta\\sin\\beta\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the coupling of the lightest higgs to a pair of massive vector bosons is given by @xmath44 the current lhc higgs data constrain @xmath45 to be close to its sm value , @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , the present best - fit values and uncertainties are @xmath47 if we assume there is no change in the higgs total width , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath48 , and @xmath49 if we allow for a change in the total decay width  @xcite . at present , the errors are still large , but requiring , for example , @xmath50 $ \\sim$}}~}0.9 $ ] , one needs to have @xmath51 $ \\sim$}}~}0.2 $ ] . as we will show later ,",
    "@xmath52 is directly proportional to the quantity @xmath53 which can be larger for larger @xmath54 values while satisfying this constraint . on the other hand , large @xmath54 values are constrained by the @xmath55 and @xmath56 processes such as @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 mixing , etc .",
    "taking into account all these constraint , we find that , @xmath52 can be as large as @xmath15 in an mssm framework .",
    "* generic supersymmetric sm : given that no signs of supersymmetry have been found so far in collider experiments , and taking into account the strong constraints on the parameter space of minimal models , it is interesting to consider more general models .",

    ", the higgs mass eigenstates @xmath29 are given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 represent the additional cp - even and cp - odd higgs states which can be charged or neutral under su(2)@xmath62 .",
    "we note that only the su(2)@xmath62-charged cp - even states contribute to the tree - level @xmath63 couplings and , due to the additional states , we generically have @xmath64 . as in the mssm framework",
    ", these couplings are constrained by the experimental results on higgs decays , but in the presence of other higgs states close to the @xmath65-gev state , the mixing pattern could be different from that in the mssm and @xmath37 and/or @xmath40 can be sizeable . in this case , one may treat @xmath37 and @xmath40 as free parameters effectively .",
    "we find that , in this case , @xmath52 can be as large as @xmath66 .",
    "processes mediated by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) involving down - type quarks have been largely studied in the context of 2hdm where significant contributions can be accommodated due to the @xmath54-enhancement of their yukawa couplings .",
    "this type of processes are very useful for investigating the dynamics of quark - flavour mixing , especially the possible non - standard phenomena . here",
    ", our main purpose is studying transitions such as @xmath67 , keeping always under control other processes that will impose additional experimental constraints , for instance , the b - meson decay @xmath68 and the mass difference @xmath69 .. as shown in @xcite , the relevant constraint on our couplings would be , @xmath70 which does not playing any relevant role in most of the considered parameter space . ]",
    "it is well - known that , in the mssm , the superpotential holomorphicity prevents the appearance of higgs - boson fcncs by coupling the higgs - doublet superfield @xmath71 to the down - quark sector and @xmath72 to the up - quark sector .",
    "however , this property is violated when considering finite radiative ( threshold ) corrections due to soft susy - breaking interactions  @xcite . as a consequence ,",

    "<S> in this work , we explore the flavour changing decays @xmath0 in a general supersymmetric scenario . in these models , </S>",
    "<S> the flavour changing decays arise at loop - level but , originating from a dimension - four operator , do not decouple and may provide a first sign of new physics for heavy masses beyond collider reach . in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , we find that the largest branching ratio of the lightest higgs ( @xmath1 ) is @xmath2 after imposing present experimental constraints , while heavy higgs states may still present branching ratios @xmath3 . in a more general supersymmetric scenario , where additional higgs states may modify the higgs mixings , the branching ratio br(@xmath4 ) can reach values @xmath5 , while heavy higgses still remain at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> although these values are clearly out of reach for the lhc , a full study in a linear collider environment could be worth .    </S>",
