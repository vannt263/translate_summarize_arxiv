    "an iron ball falling in oil reaches after some time a constant velocity .",
    "it is then not accelerated anymore .",
    "the same happens with rain drops in air .",
    "these are two examples of our everyday life where a classical system undergoes a uniform motion when acted by a viscid medium ( oil in the first example and air in the second one ) .",
    "this effect arises when the friction with such a medium compensates the acceleration induced by the gravity acting on the system .",
    "but , what about quantum systems ? may they display such behaviors ?",
    "actually , how would a viscid quantum medium act on a quantum system , if such a medium exists ? these are natural questions that come to our minds when trying to establish a correspondence with the analogous classical systems . however , before considering a model to describe such a situation , it is interesting to make some considerations on quantum systems in the light of the theory of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "real systems are not in isolation in nature .",
    "rather , we find them coupled to other systems , namely an environment or bath . the usual way to tackle their study is first by considering a system - plus - reservoir hamiltonian system , which includes all the involved degrees of freedom ( those from the system plus those from the environment ) as well as their coupling",
    ". however , not always a full quantum - mechanical description in these terms is affordable and therefore one has to consider simpler models consisting of the bare ( isolated ) system hamiltonian plus an effective , time - dependent interaction . although these models do not provide us with any information regarding the environmental dynamics , they are very convenient to describe its effects on the system , even if the problem becomes _",
    "nonconservative_. phenomenological equations only accounting for the system dynamics are , for example , the lindblad or the quantum langevin equations . in the first case ,",
    "an effective description of the evolution of the ( reduced ) system density matrix is achieved by including a series of dissipation operators or dissipators in the corresponding equation of motion . in the second case",
    ", the equation describes the evolution of an operator associated with a certain observable ( e.g. , the system position ) , and apart from a dissipative term the equation also includes a stochastic noise related to the environmental fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , in both cases the effect on the system dynamics is the same : a loss of the system coherence ( decoherence ) and a relaxation or damping of its energy .    in the particular case of the quantum langevin equation , a ( quantum ) noise function",
    "is included in order to account for the environmental thermal fluctuations on the system ( brownian - like motion ) .",
    "this equation can be reformulated in terms of a hamiltonian model , where the noise arises from a collection of harmonic oscillators coupled to the system .",
    "this is the so - called caldeira - leggett model @xcite .",
    "predating this model , though , we find a former dissipative one , the so - called caldirola - kanai model @xcite .",
    "this is a hamiltonian reformulation of the langevin equation with zero fluctuations , i.e. , the brownian - like thermal fluctuations that sustain the system motion are neglected and the system undergoes a gradual decay until all its energy is completely , irreversibly lost by dissipation",
    ". then the system dynamics stops .",
    "the behavior exhibited by quantum systems described by the caldirola - kanai model contradicts the uncertainty relations even so it has been considered by a number of authors with different purposes , from computational issues to more fundamental aspects of dissipative quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "the reason for this behavior comes from the fact that this model is incomplete , i.e. , it is a model that only describes a system gradually losing its energy , but not a _",
    "larger _ model that includes another subsystem gaining the energy that our system loses @xcite . to avoid this inconvenience ,",
    "alternative nonlinear schrdinger equations have been proposed in the literature , one of them being kostin s model @xcite , which is somehow connected with the bohmian approach that is considered in this work .",
    "contrary to the caldirola - kanai model , kostin s hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time , although it contains a friction term proportional to the phase of the wave function ( and hence an implicit time - dependence ) . within the bohmian or hydrodynamic picture of quantum mechanics",
    "@xcite , this term is thus related to the local value of the velocity of an element of the quantum fluid ( i.e. , the quantum system treated as a fluid ) , thus establishing a connection between the classical concept of friction ( as it appears in the langevin equation ) and a feasible quantum one .    the purpose of this work is to analyze the dissipative dynamics associated with the caldirola - kanai model in the framework of bohmian mechanics ( quantum hydrodynamics ) to shed some light on the dynamics affected by a hypothetical , fully quantum viscid medium . as pointed out above",
    ", the system dynamics will exhibit full dissipation ( which can be considered a pathology of the model , but an interesting one ) , because its incompleteness , i.e. , the lack of fluctuations that allow the system to reach some equilibrium @xcite , as happens in quantum brownian motion , or another subsystem gaining the energy that it loses @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the trajectories or streamlines obtained should be considered as reduced ones @xcite , i.e. , solely related to the system studied by with no relation to any larger system . in this sense , these trajectories become tools to only describe the ( reduced ) dynamics of the subsystem under consideration . by inspecting the topology displayed by the bohmian trajectories ,",
    "the effects of dissipation readily become apparent , such as localization by freezing the wave function evolution or the emergence of classical - like behaviors .    as far as we know , bohmian mechanics has not been widely used within the context considered here despite of the fact that it seems to be an appropriate tool to analyze the quantum dissipative phenomena . in this regard ,",
    "the first application was carried out about 20 years ago by vandyck @xcite , who tackled the issue of the decay of harmonic oscillator eigenstates .",
    "ten years later , shojai and shojai analyzed @xcite the problem of friction of two - level system transition by reformulating such a problem in bohmian terms .",
    "at a more practical level , tilbi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used bohmian mechanics to derive an expression of the caldirola - kanai propagator starting from the feynman path integral approach . in this",
    "regard , apart from offering a bohmian description of dissipative systems within the caldirola - kanai context , another purpose of this work is to establish a general hydrodynamic dissipative framework ( within this model ) where the use of transformations that make the system to satisfy the uncertainty relations @xcite is not necessary .",
    "this is essentially in view of tackling more complex , higher - dimensional systems , where such transformations can not be easily found ( if possible at all ) and the use of numerical simulations is mandatory .",
    "these further analyses , though , have been left out of the scope of the present work , since the aim here is to investigate analytically ( as far as possible ) the friction effects on the quantum system by means of the corresponding bohmian trajectories . in this sense , we have considered simple yet physically insightful scenarios , such as the wave - packet dynamics in free space , and also under the action of linear and harmonic potentials , as well as two wave - packet interference , all of them affected by the friction of a surrounding viscid medium .",
    "these examples will allow us to understand how friction gives rise to localization , to a type of quantum - to - classical transitions , or to the disappearance of the zero - point energy .",
    "taking into account these scopes , the work has been organized as follows .",

    "[ sec5 ] a series of concluding remarks drawn from this work are discussed .",
    "there are different strategies to construct hamiltonian functions to account for dissipative systems and then , from them , to obtain the corresponding quantum hamiltonian operators @xcite .",
    "one of them consists in considering time - dependent lagrangians ( and therefore hamiltonians ) , which avoids us to deal explicitly with the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "this approach preserves the canonical formalism and can be a good starting point to find out the quantal analog of the corresponding dissipative dynamics . here",
    ", the caldirola - kanai hamiltonian model constitutes a paradigm of dissipation .",

    "the quantum hamiltonian operator thus reads as = -  e^-t ^2_x + v(x ) e^t .",
    "[ hamckq ] now , given the dependence of this hamiltonian _ only _ on @xmath13 , it can be recast in terms of @xmath20 , without loss of generality .",
    "this leads us to the the generalized , dissipative schrdinger equation , i_t = -  e^-t ^2_x + v(x ) e^t , [ dissschro ] in terms of the physical coordinate .",
    "notice that as long as quantities related to the momentum operator are not computed , the use of this wave equation in the physical coordinate space is formally correct ( otherwise , the canonical operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 should be considered ) .",
    "hence , at this stage , we can consider the polar ansatz @xmath23 , typically used in bohmian mechanics , where @xmath24 is the probability density and @xmath25 is the real phase field .",

    "as it can be noticed , both @xmath28 and @xmath29 display the same functional form as their non - dissipative counterparts , but multiplied by the time - dependent decaying factor , @xmath30 .",
    "this fact also manifests in the corresponding dissipative bohmian trajectories , which are obtained from the equation of motion = =  e^-t = ( ^ * _ x - _ x ^ * ) e^-t .",

    "( [ bohmtrad ] ) .",
    "in principle , general quantum dissipative problems described by the hamiltonian model ( [ hamckq ] ) have to be tackled by means of numerical techniques , where the dissipative , time - dependent schrdinger equation ( [ dissschro ] ) can be solved by using standard wave - packet propagation methods .",
    "nevertheless , as also happens with non - dissipative quantum mechanics , for potential functions which are of quadratic or lesser order , we can find analytic solutions , which turn out to be very insightful to better understand the physics of some problems . in particular",

    "these solutions can be easily obtained by proceeding as follows .",
    "it is well - known that a few parameters are enough to completely characterize a wave function described by a gaussian wave packet @xcite .",
    "so , for analytical purposes , consider the ansatz @xcite ( x , t ) = e^(i/ ) , [ waved ] where a subscript @xmath32 is used throughout this work to denote explicit time - dependence of the parameters characterizing the wave function ( the subscript 0 indicates their value at @xmath33 ) .",
    "this ansatz has been expressed in terms of the canonical variables , because it involves the momentum and , as mentioned above , only the canonical momentum makes meaningful the schrdinger equation ( [ dissschro ] ) the kinetic operator was defined according to @xmath21 , not with respect to the physical momentum , @xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless , later on it will be recast in terms of the physical variables , which represent the correct ( physical ) centroidal trajectory ( @xmath35 ) , in order to analyze the friction effects in the real configuration space .",
    "regarding the shape and normalization complex functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , since they are eventually functions of the canonical coordinates , they can be readily recast in terms of the physical ones .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to make any additional assumption on them .",
    "consider that the wave function ( [ waved ] ) is normalized , which means that the imaginary part of @xmath37 normalizes this wave function and follows from assuming the initial condition f_0 = , with @xmath38 .",
    "in such a case , the position and momentum expectation values ( and therefore the wave - packet centroid ) follow a classical trajectory , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with ( @xmath41 ) being obtained by integrating the hamilton equations of motion ( [ hamflow ] ) , i.e. , _ t & = &  e^-t , [ wave1 ] + _ t & = & - _",

    "[ sec4 - 1 ] ) , it will not influence the bohmian dynamics and therefore we will not consider its explicit functional form .",
    "thus , integrating the set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( [ wave1 ] ) , ( [ wave2 ] ) , ( [ wave3 ] ) and ( [ wave4 ] ) , we have the wave function ( [ waved ] ) completely specified at any time . substituting this wave function into the bohmian equation of motion ( [ bohmtrad ] ) ,",

    "equation  ( [ bohmdh ] ) turns out to be very interesting , because if the second term vanishes , we find that the bohmian trajectory exactly coincides with the classical one given by ( [ wave2 ] ) . notice that , accordingly , the condition of classicality does not require necessarily of the limiting procedure of @xmath53 , but that the wave packet remains relatively localized ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , in agreement with the hypothesis of ehrenfest s theorem @xcite . on the other hand , this equation also shows us that quantum motion can be observed even though the probability density becomes negligible provided the phase is well - defined .",
    "in other words , if @xmath55 and the wave function becomes a pure phase factor ( except for some time - dependent norm coming from @xmath37 ) , quantum motion can still be observed through both @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "[ frozenpos ] that is , the wave packet becomes localized : motionless and with the spreading being frozen .",

    "as it can be readily shown , the expression for the average energy is given by |e =  e^-2 t - max_0 - p_0 a ( ) ^2 + ( ) +  e^-2 t , [ eq6 ] in the limit @xmath102 , this expression approaches |e = - max_0 - + ( 3 - 2 t ) .",
    "[ eq6b ] the linear regime typical of the limit motion can be inferred for the lower values of @xmath2 .",
    "however , this effect is more remarkable for larger @xmath2 , since the transient exponentials vanish quickly and the energy immediately manifests its linear dependence on time . unlike the example of the free wave packet , here the energy does not approach zero asymptotically , but it continues decreasing below it as the wave packet slides downhill , unless some additional constraint is imposed in the dynamics to avoiding this situation .",
    "this is precisely the case of confining potential functions displaying local minima , such as the harmonic oscillator , which will be studied in the next section ( for similar behaviors in non - harmonic systems , for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , although there is no suppression of the motion , we can still observe spatial localization .    to some extent the behavior displayed by the wave packet under",
    "the action of a linear potential is similar , asymptotically , to reach a classical - like regime .",
    "this can be better understood by inspecting the associated bohmian trajectories .",
    "these trajectories are plotted in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , from ( d ) to ( e ) for increasing values of @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting that , because @xmath36 does not depend on the potential function , the functional form displayed by the trajectories is exactly the same as in the free case , except for the fact that these trajectories contain information about the acceleration undergone by the centroid ( this information is transmitted through @xmath103 ) .",
    "now , once the transients have vanished , all these trajectories evolve parallel one another , just like classical trajectories under similar circumstances ( i.e. , in this limit case ) .",
    "let us consider now the case of a harmonic oscillator potential , @xmath104 . in a frictionless situation ,",
    "this system is characterized by a series of eigenstates _",

    "these eigenvalues can be obtained by employing the same method used above to derive the analytical expression of the time - evolved wave packets @xcite .",

    "[ traeigen ] that is , regardless of the eigenstate considered , any trajectory falls down to the bottom of the potential at the same rate , @xmath110 , and therefore merging asymptotically at @xmath111 .",
    "the reason for such a behavior is that the model is fully dissipative and there is no possibility for a feedback with an environment , as happens when a brownian - like motion is assumed . in this latter case ,",
    "the stochastic fluctuations accounting for the feedback with a surrounding medium would be enough to sustain a dynamical regime ( even if stationary ) and avoid its full collapse .",
    "the previous case was already investigated by vandyck @xcite and in order to gain insight on it , now we are going to consider the case of a coherent ( or minimum uncertainty ) gaussian wave packet initially centered around the turning point @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) . at any subsequent time , this wave packet is described by @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "as also happens in classical mechanics , in order to proceed analytically in the dissipative case , it is important to distinguish three cases depending on whether @xmath118 is larger than , equal to or smaller than @xmath110 , i.e. , if we have underdamped oscillatory motion , critically damped motion , or overdamped motion , respectively .",

    ". therefore , we have that _",
    "t = ( 1 + ) e^t .",
    "[ alphat1 ] notice that in the limit of vanishing friction , this value approaches the frictionless one mentioned above .",
    "more importantly , @xmath36 has a real and an imaginary part , and therefore the wave function will be properly normalized",

    "as it can be noticed , the first three arguments in the exponential of ( [ wphod ] ) are identical to those in ( [ wpho ] ) , but replacing @xmath118 by @xmath157 .",
    "the wave function is properly normalized , but its width decreases exponentially with time , according to x = _ t e^-2 t .",

    "along this transit , the system energy is also exponentially lost , according to |e =  m_0 ^ 2 x_0 ^ 2 ( ) ^2 e^-t +  _ 0 ( ) e^-t .",
    "it is worth stressing that for underdamped conditions , @xmath36 , given by ( [ alphat1 ] ) , is a complex function , which makes the wave function ( [ wphod ] ) to display a vanishing gaussian shape plus a phase factor as the system oscillates , as seen in ( [ wphod ] ) .",
    "critically damped and overdamped conditions imply that the motion amplitude of the system exhibits a monotonic decrease to zero , with no oscillations . in the present context , where we are seeking for solutions such that @xmath149 , this now translates into a rather puzzling quantum behavior . in order to analyze it ,",
    "let us start from the overdamped condition , @xmath136 .",
    "equation  ( [ gmot ] ) is still valid , although we have @xmath158 . between these two solutions ,",
    "we choose @xmath147 , because it is consistent with ( [ alphat1 ] ) and also because it corresponds to the long - time limit of @xmath125 in this case ( i.e. , for @xmath159 ) .",
    "accordingly , the spreading factor will read as _ t = ( 1 - ) e^t , which is a pure real function . from it , f_t = f_0 + ( 1 - ) t + _ cl , t , where @xmath160 is now left as a free parameter , although its imaginary part has to be such that the initial plane wave is still normalized and validates the working hypothesis regarding the expectation values of the position and momentum .",
    "notice that in this case , the corresponding wave function reads as ( x , t ) = e^-(im/2)(1 + /2 ) e^t(x - x_t)^2 + ip_t ( x - x_t)/+ t ( 1 + /2)/2 + if_0 + i_cl , t/ , [ wphod2 ] which is a pure phase factor multiplied by a diverging time - dependent exponential .",
    "it is interesting , though , that although the wave function itself diverges , the associated bohmian trajectories are well - defined and approach asymptotically the classical overdamped centroid , @xmath103 ( see below ) .    regarding the critically damped situation , if we consider here the initial value @xmath161 , the stationary solution is @xmath162 , and therefore _",
    "t = -  e^t .",

    "now , consider a problem involving wave - packet interference , for which a general solution can be expressed as a coherent superposition @xcite , = ( _ 1 + _ 2 ) , with @xmath166 being the overall norm factor ( it is assumed that each gaussian wave packet , given by ( [ wfsanz08 ] ) , is normalized ) .",
    "as it can be shown , the associated bohmian equation of motion reads as & = &  _ 1 +  _ 2 + ( _ 1^ * _ x _ 2 - _ 2 _ x _ 1^ * ) e^-t + ( _ 2^ * _ x _ 1 - _ 1 _ x _ 2^ * ) e^-t + & = & + + & & + 2_12   + & & - 2_12   e^-t , [ traj2wp ] where @xmath167 refers to the equation of motion for the @xmath168th wave packet and @xmath169 , being @xmath170 and @xmath171 the probability density and real phase associated with the @xmath168th wave packet when it is expressed in polar form . as it can be noticed , this expression simply reflects the sum of two separate fluxes , each one associated with one wave packet , plus another one coming from their interference .    depending on the value given to the parameters of each wave packet , one can generate different dynamics .",
    "for example , if they have the same width ( @xmath172 ) and are located at symmetric positions with respect to @xmath111 ( @xmath173 ) , then ( [ traj2wp ] ) simplifies to & = & + + & & + 2_12   + 2_12   .",
    "[ traj2wp2 ] thus , consider the case of two interfering coherent wave packets in free space .",
    "this situation , for example , mimics the situation of a two slit experiment when each wave packet is associated with one of the diffracted beams .",
    "in such a case , if the longitudinal propagation ( parallel to the diffractive screen ) is slower than the perpendicular one ( in the direction of the diffracted beam ) , both motions can be decoupled and treated as two independent one - dimensional propagations , one longitudinal and the other translational , the latter being well accounted for by a plane wave . now , if one assumes that @xmath174 , i.e. , there is no translational motion along the longitudinal direction , but only spreading of the two wave packets @xcite , the above expression ( [ traj2wp2 ] ) will read as & = & + + & & + 2_12   + 2_12   .",
    "[ traj2wp2free ] results after integration of this equation of motion for different values of @xmath2 ( the same values as in the case of the free wave packet treated above ) can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . as it can be seen through the sets of trajectories selected",
    ", the friction of the medium leads to the localization of the two wave packets by gradually `` freezing '' them rather than by annihilating the coherence between them due to the interaction with an environment , as happens with @xcite .",
    "in other words , the reason why interference is not observed in a quantum viscid medium is because the wave packets can not be seen each other , rather than because the destruction ( over time ) of their mutual coherence .",

    "however , an even more direct link can be established with the hydrodynamic reformulation of schrdinger s wave mechanics proposed in 1926 by madelung @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the evolution of a quantum system can be connected to that of an ideal ( quantum ) fluid by means of a simple nonlinear transformation , which goes from the wave function to two real fields , namely the probability density and the phase field ( or , to make the analogy more apparent , the quantum current density ) .",
    "this work would then go a step beyond by assuming the medium is not ideal , but viscid . to some extent ,",
    "the introduction of a friction makes the approach to somehow resemble bell s beables interpretation , particularly as further developed by vink @xcite and lorenzen _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "actually , the latter also considered friction as a means to interpret and understand phenomena such as dissipation , decoherence , or the quantum - to - classical transition in quantum systems .",
    "now , the problem posed by the caldirola - kanai model analyzed here is that the standard quantum uncertainty relations are violated .",
    "alternative nonlinear models have been proposed in the literature to overcome this inconvenience , such as kostin s model @xcite , which includes in the schrdinger equation a friction term proportional to the phase of the wave function ( related , as seen above , to the bohmian momentum ) .",
    "because of this term , although the quantum system displays a similar damping to the one observed here , the width of the wave function does not collapse to zero in the case of the harmonic oscillator , for example , thus preserving the uncertainty relations . more importantly",
    ", this model has been recently used by garashchuk and coworkers @xcite with the practical purpose of obtaining the ground state in arbitrary potential functions an analogous result , starting from similar grounds , was previously found by doebner and goldin @xcite .",
    "the difference between the effective dissipative schrdinger equation found by the latter authors with respect to eq .",
    "( [ dissschro ] ) arises from the way how it is obtained from the langevin equation ( [ langed ] ) . while in our case",
    "this is done from a linear , but time - dependent hamiltonian operator , in the case of these authors the hamiltonian is time - independent , but nonlinear an interesting discussion on these two procedures can be found in @xcite . from a physical viewpoint ,",
    "the role of this nonlinearity is equivalent to adding a noise on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ langed ] ) in order to avoid the collapse of the system or its localization .",
    "that is , it enables a kind of fluctuation - dissipation relation , although the corresponding nonlinear schrdinger equation ( kostin s equation ) still describes one subsystem and , therefore , the associated bohmian trajectories are reduced in the same sense as those here analyzed ( we still have an incomplete view of the process ) .",
    "alternative and possible applications of this type of studies can be developed in several ways .",
    "first , it is well known that a quantum brownian particle moving in a periodic potential , coupled to a dissipative environment and at zero temperature , undergoes a transition from an extended to a localized ground state as the friction is raised @xcite .",
    "we think our methodology could throw some new light on this aspect as well as when a harmonic oscillator is interacting with a one - dimensional massless scalar field @xcite .",
    "second , when considering the lowest frequency motion or frustrated translational motion of adsorbates on corrugated surfaces @xcite . in this problem ,",
    "such a motion can be similarly seen as that described by a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is true that a certain feedback between the thermal bath due to the presence of the surface and the quasi harmonic oscillator can not be neglected .",
    "however , if the surface temperature is really low , the corresponding dynamics has to be closer to a pure dissipative dynamics as considered in this work .",
    "third , within the same context , the diffusion of adsorbates on flat surfaces implies a free propagation of wave packets in the presence of friction .",
    "again , the surface temperature is supposed to be low enough in order to highlight the role of the dissipation . in a flat surface , the collision between two adsorbates",
    "could also be described by the interference dynamics in presence of a thermal bath or surface . in this sense",
    ", a new friction mechanism could be added which is the so - called collisional friction @xcite . and fourth",
    ", our study could be easily extended to gas phase molecular processes where the interaction among different molecules or atoms due to a high pressure could be replaced by such a friction mechanism",
    ". it should be then easily analyzed , for example , the broadening of spectral lines in this collisional regime .",

    "<S> these examples illustrate interesting emerging behaviors , such as localization by `` quantum freezing '' or a particular type of quantum - classical correspondence . the reliability of the results analytically determined has been checked by means of numerical simulations , which has served to investigate other problems lacking of such analyticity ( e.g. , the coherent superpositions ) .    </S>",
