    "a hot gaseous component in the interstellar medium with a temperature around 10@xmath13 k is expected to originate from snrs in the disk of spiral galaxies .",

    "while the higher resolution of the hri detector allows us to resolve the bright nuclear and x - ray plume area , the lower instrumental background , the energy resolution and the high collecting area in the 0.10.4 kev band makes the pspc best suited for studying large - scale diffuse emission in the disk and halo of the galaxy .",
    "separating diffuse emission components from point source contributions is an ambitious task keeping in mind the limited spatial resolution of the rosat pspc detector . to lose as little area as possible , point sources contained in the source catalog of paper i were cut out with radii optimized to the point spread function ( psf ) of the telescope / detector at the relevant energy ( see table [ psf ] ) .",

    "32 of which are associated with the disk of the galaxy .",
    "though 27 of these sources are detected with the hri ( some being resolvable with the pspc ) , the remaining 5 pspc - only detected sources are most likely due to fluctuations within the diffuse x - ray emission ( see figs . 2 and 4 of paper i ) . the area around the nucleus",

    "while four of the sources detected within this region are most likely background active galactic nuclei ( agn , as suggested by time variability arguments and proposed optical identification ) , two pspc - only detected sources ( x24 and x27 of paper i ) are most likely spurious detections caused by local enhancements in the diffuse emission .",
    "x10 , another pspc - only detected extended source in the nw halo , might be a background cluster of galaxies , as it shows a harder spectrum than the surrounding diffuse emission .",
    "several methods are used to characterize the diffuse x - ray emission components of ngc  253 .",
    "iso - intensity contour maps exhibit the point sources and diffuse emission with high resolution for the hri .",
    "the maps are split up in several energy bands , however with lower spatial resolution for the pspc .",
    "the images in different pspc energy bands can be combined to a  true \" colour image of the galaxy .",
    "we further investigate the emission components with respect to spatial distribution ( box profiles along major and minor axis and azimuthal profiles for different energy bands and the x - ray plume region ) and spectral behavior ( e.g. integrated spectra of nuclear component , x - ray plume , disk , and halo , temperature profiles of the halo ) . in the following subsections",
    "we describe the procedures used for the analysis and we present a first discussion of results .",
    "the central area is best imaged with a contour plot from the hri data .",

    "while the source @xmath4 20  south of the nucleus ( x33 ) is a time variable point source ( fwhm @xmath45 , see paper i ) , the source close to the nucleus ( x34 ) is extended ( fwhm @xmath423  and @xmath419 , i.e. 290 pc and 240 pc in east / west and north / south directions , respectively ) , with the intensity maximum offset by 83 to the se of the nucleus , possibly representing the hottest part of the gas out - flowing from the nuclear starburst region ( cf .",

    "snowden et al .",
    "all sub - images were corrected for exposure , vignetting , and dead time , and were smoothed with a gaussian filter of a fwhm corresponding to the on - axis point spread function ( psf ) of that particular energy band .",

    "[ four_in_one ] contour plots are overlaid on grey scale images of the x - ray emission for the broad ( 0.12.4 kev , upper left ) , soft ( 0.10.4 kev , upper right ) , hard1 ( 0.50.9 kev , lower left ) , and hard2 ( 0.92.0 kev , lower right ) band , respectively .    visual inspection of the sub - images reveals several components of diffuse emission :    * emission outside of the disk is absent in the hard2 map , and only present in the nw hemisphere in the hard1 . * the soft emission in both halo hemispheres suggests a filamentary structure that can not be fully resolved due to the limitations of the rosat pspc psf . *",
    "the diffuse emission in the soft band in the se shows a flat maximum ( projected distance of about 45  se of the ngc  253 nucleus ) and seems to floats on the disk like a spectacle - glass ( diameter of 16  @xmath23 12 kpc ) , from which two  horns \" protrude ( separation at the connection with the diffuse disk emission about 5  @xmath23 3.7 kpc ) reaching into the se halo out to a projected distance of more than 7  ( 5.2 kpc ) , being turned inward .",
    "the horn emanating from the northern half of the disk is more pronounced . *",
    "the soft emission in the nw ( extent 12  @xmath23 9 kpc parallel to the disk and 88 @xmath23 6.6 kpc in perpendicular direction ) is separated from the emission in the se by @xmath4 12 @xmath23 900 pc and also exhibits an inward turned horn - like structure .",
    "again , the horn emanating from the northern half of the disk is more pronounced . *",
    "the emission in the hard bands shows  besides point sources  a strong extended filamentary component from the inner disk that protrudes from a hardly resolved bright nucleus and traces the inner spiral arms .",
    "in addition , there is a less structured diffuse component of the disk . from inspection of the sub - bands r6 ( 0.91.3 kev ) and r7 ( 1.32.0 kev )",
    "we find that the diffuse components vanish in the r7 band .",
    "* both hard bands reveal emission protruding into the nw halo along the minor axis . while in the hard2 band",
    "this component can only be traced for about 1  @xmath23 750 pc ( mainly in the area with highly reduced emission in the soft band ) , it extends along the northern horn as far as the soft emission in the hard1 band .",

    "soft sources appear in red , with a  red \" intensity proportional to the intensity in the soft image , harder sources in green and blue .",
    "the point sources in the disk area are hard , the greenish colour of the diffuse disk emission suggests a hotter or more strongly absorbed gaseous component compared to that in the halo .",
    "the nw rim of the disk is bluer than the se part which is most probably due to the fact that in the nw one mainly detects hot gas absorbed in the disk while the emission in the se is a superposition of the softer halo emission in the near halo hemisphere and the disk component from the se .",
    "the greenish colour connecting to the red nw halo again suggests emission from highly absorbed hot gas . due to the cut values used ,",
    "the nuclear area is over - exposed .      to quantify the findings of the last subsection",

    "this may be explained by higher absorption in this direction ( see discussion below ) .    to further characterize the diffuse nuclear emission components , we made use of the spectral capabilities of the pspc .",
    "this investigation , however , is hampered by the larger psf of the pspc compared to the hri . especially in the soft energy band ( fwhm of psf @xmath4 40 )",

    "table [ spec - tab ] summarizes the regions for source and background and gives net counts and hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 ( see paper i for definitions ) .",
    "the hardness ratios indicate a highly absorbed and rather steep spectrum for the nuclear source , while the x - ray plume is less absorbed and much softer ( cf .",

    "raw spectra were rebinned to obtain at least the signal to noise level per bin given in col . 1 of table [ spec ] .",
    "we give fluxes and luminosities outside the galaxy ( f@xmath94 and l@xmath94 , measured n@xmath32 minus galactic n@xmath32 ) , as well as intrinsic to the source ( f@xmath95 and l@xmath95 , i.e. absorption zero ) .",
    "rough errors for the fluxes and luminosities in table [ spec ] are indicated by the statistical errors of the net counts ( see table [ spec - tab ] ) .",
    "additional uncertainties arise from the poor knowledge of the spectrum , as can be seen by comparing the fluxes derived for different models .",
    "when the field background is used , simple power law ( powl ) , thermal bremsstrahlung ( thbr ) , or thin thermal plasma ( thpl ) spectra with cosmic abundances ( raymond & smith 1977 and updates ) do not allow a proper description of the nuclear spectrum ( x34 ) . if , however , the spectrum is corrected for the local background , the first two models fit the nuclear spectrum quite well , and also a thpl approximation can not be totally rejected .",
    "all models indicate high absorption ( n@xmath32 of a few times 10@xmath96 to more than 10@xmath97 @xmath2 ) and rather soft spectra ( photon index 2.9 or temperatures from 0.4 to 1.2 kev ) .",
    "this suggests that with the local background the soft extended emission above the nuclear area is properly subtracted .",
    "we have therefore attempted to take it into account by fitting a more complex model to the data derived using the field background .",
    "we have assumed a two - component model composed of a thbr spectrum with the temperature fixed to 1.2 kev ( the value determined using local background ) and a thpl spectrum using cosmic abundance with fixed galactic absorption .",
    "this resulted in an acceptable fit .",

    "the thbr component is much less absorbed than for the nucleus and the temperature of the thpl with @xmath4 0.3 kev a bit cooler than for the nuclear spectrum .    as mentioned above , the spatial resolution of the rosat hri allows us to separately estimate the contribution from x34 , the x - ray plume , and the point source x33 . from the numbers given in paper i we determine rosat hri count rates of ( @xmath100 ) and ( @xmath101 ) @xmath102 cts s@xmath26 for the nuclear source ( local background subtracted ) and the x - ray plume , respectively . using the x34_local thbr model parameters from the pspc , the count rates for the nuclear source give an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath103 , slightly higher than the pspc value . for the x - ray plume , the soft and hard component of the pspc - based two - component model lead to contributions to the hri count rates that are a factor of 1.3 higher for the thbr than for the thpl component .",
    "also the soft component of the x34 spectrum - that is even hotter than the x - ray plume component - has to be added to the hri flux .",
    "therefore we estimate that the thbr and thpl component contribute with a ratio of 3 to 4 and we assume a thpl temperature of 0.4 kev ( average of x34 and x - ray plume values ) . with these assumptions",
    "we calculate intrinsic luminosities of 4.6 and 4.0 @xmath104   for the thbr and thpl components of the x - ray plume spectrum , respectively .",
    "these values are about a factor of four above those derived with the pspc .",
    "the difference is caused by the pspc extraction strategy : we used only part of the psf area of x34 for the spectrum to reject contributions for x33 . also the rejection radii for x33 and x34",
    "strongly reduce the area for the x - ray plume spectrum",
    ".    however , we have to place a caveat here .",
    "it is clear from the structured hri and energy - resolved pspc images that more than two components contribute to the spectra .",
    "they originate from the nuclear area , x - ray plume , disk and halo and certainly are seen through different amounts of absorbing matter .",
    "using a local background for the nuclear spectrum allows us to reduce the influence of the surrounding components .",
    "nevertheless , the assumed spectral models will be a simplification .",
    "the fact that a thermal bremsstrahlung or power law spectrum fit best for the absorbed nuclear component and also for the absorbed component of the x - ray plume , should not be over - interpreted but may only reflect that several thin thermal components of differing temperature add up to the spectrum .",
    "this may be an artefact of the limited energy coverage and resolution of the rosat pspc , and can hopefully be resolved with the next generation of x - ray instruments .      to investigate the diffuse emission from the disk and halo we make use of the nearly homogeneous sensitivity of the pspc for low surface brightness features in the area within the ring of the window support structure ( 21  radius ) .",
    "we examine box profiles along the galaxy axes , azimuthal profiles , and spectra integrated over different areas . to suppress contributions from point sources we follow a different strategy in creating profiles for the individual energy bands and in extracting spectral files .",
    "when creating profiles in the soft band , we cut out only sources outside the disk and x15 using a cut radius of @xmath105fwhm of the psf at 0.30 kev , since no source from the point source catalog coincides with a point source in the soft band in the disk area ( within corrected d@xmath106 ) .",

    "its intrinsic luminosity may therefore be well in excess of the number given above and does not really restrict the limits derived from the rosat observations .",
    "the same arguments hold for the bepposax observations , that show extended emission best modeled by a hot thermal plasma ( @xmath155 kev ) with the inclusion of an fe k line and have been tentatively identified with a starburst - driven galactic super - wind ( persic et al .",

    "should then be possible to decide on the nature of the radio - bright nuclear source which , according to ulvestad & antonucci ( 1997 ) , can still be either an agn or a very compact supernova remnant .",

    "m82 shows x - ray emission from a strong galactic wind and the halo ( e.g. strickland et al .",
    "if indeed such a low - luminosity agn were also confirmed for ngc 253 , the other nearby prototypical starburst galaxy with galactic wind and x - ray emission from the halo , this might strengthen the view of an intrinsic connection of these phenomena as proposed by pietsch et al .",

    "this analysis in principle does conform with our above interpretation .",
    "the main difference is that by careful positioning ( see paper i ) we demonstrate that the emission in the rosat band is not originating from the nucleus but from a height above the plane of ngc 253 where the extinction is already significantly reduced and transparent to radiation in the rosat band . at this height , the x - ray beam which may be collimated in the inner disk by the cold gas torus as suggested above , may already have widened by a factor @xmath156 as indicated from the extent reported in sect .",

    "the sum of our components differs , however , significantly from the parameters derived by read et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using integral properties of the diffuse emission of ngc 253 ; they find lower gas masses and shorter cooling times as well as allowing for lower electron densities in the radiating plasma .    if the hot gas in the outer halo represents nuclear and disk material transported into the halo by the super - wind with a velocity of @xmath4350 km s@xmath26 as modeled for the optical emission cone close to the nucleus ( cf .",
    "4.2.2 ) , we can calculate from the halo extent of 9 kpc a lower limit for the age of the wind of @xmath206 y. this time is comparable to the age of the rapid massive star formation in the nucleus of ngc 253 , derived from evolutionary synthesis models ( @xmath207 y , e.g. engelbracht et al . 1998 ) , it is shorter , however , by at least an order of magnitude than the cooling time of the hot gas in the halo calculated above . from these considerations it is possible that the hot halo gas was heated in the starburst nucleus and transported into the halo by the wind .",
    "however , one could also consider that the wind is heating ambient gas in the halo .",
    "the first scenario has been proposed by tomisaka & ikeuchi ( 1988 ) .",
    "their model of a galactic scale bipolar flow assumes a disk component to represent the interstellar medium of the starburst galaxy , which for some time confines the hot matter within a cool shell , which is further heated by supernova explosions of massive stars formed in the nuclear starburst .",
    "eventually , the shell breaks up and releases the hot gas into the halo .",
    "suchkov et al .",
    "( 1994 ) improved the model by including an ambient two - component disk - halo interstellar medium and argued that this two - component representation is crucial for adequate modeling of starbursts . in their models ,",
    "the bulk of the soft thermal x - ray emission from starbursts arises in the wind - shocked material of the halo and disk gas transported into the halo , rather than in the hot wind material itself .",
    "the super - wind itself is too hot and thin , to be visible in the rosat band and reaches speeds of @xmath42000 km",
    "s@xmath26 . the models allow to produce x - ray geometries and filamentary structures similar to those observed in ngc 253 and propose a temperature distribution of the heated material of @xmath208 k. however , they neglect the role of cosmic rays , magnetic fields , and delayed recombination ( breitschwerdt & komossa 1999 ) .",
    "the spectra from the halo hemispheres can not be fitted by simple thin thermal plasma models .",
    "however , two temperature models or a one temperature model with additional emission components above 0.7 kev give reasonable fits to the data ( sect . 3.2.2 ) .",
    "this confirms on a smaller scale results by e.g. dahlem et al .",
    "1998 and strickland & stevens 1998 who found observational evidence that the spectra of the diffuse soft x - ray emission in galactic winds or superbubbles suggest more than a single temperature . the temperatures and luminosities of the observed ngc 253 halo components are consistent with luminosities and the temperature distribution proposed by the models for the heated material in the halo .",
    "breitschwerdt & schmutzler ( 1999 ) showed that the assumption of cooling via collisional ionization equilibrium used in the thin thermal plasma models are not correct if the dynamical time scale of the plasma , as for instance in an out - flowing wind , is much shorter than the intrinsic time scales ( e.g. recombination , collisional excitation , ionization etc . ) .",
    "therefore , the dynamical and thermal evolution of the plasma has to be treated self - consistently .",
    "first results show that the expected spectra of cooling wind material in the halo should exhibit enhanced emission in lines at energies above @xmath40.7 kev ( e.g. from ovii , oviii , and highly ionized fe ) , compared to equilibrium models , as well as a lower plasma temperature due to adiabatic expansion . since recombination of highly ionized species is delayed , the resulting x - ray line emission reflects the  initial temperature \" of the plasma close to the disk , when it was much hotter . in these non - equilibrium models",
    "one can not determine a single cooling timescale ,  equilibrium cooling \" due to expansion is likely to be much shorter than the equilibrium value given in table [ halo_par ] and the time scale for line recombination longer .",
    "numerical simulations for a galactic outflow including non - equilibrium x - ray emission in a self - consistent fashion have been folded through the rosat pspc instrumental response ( breitschwerdt & freyberg 2000 ) .",
    "best fitting spectral models are two temperature thin thermal plasma or a one temperature model with an additonal gaussian component similar to our finding .",
    "breitschwerdt & freyberg argue that the two fitted temperatures are not physical but mimic non - equilibrium x - ray emission .    keeping in mind the super - wind origin of the halo emission , one can consider several explanations for the asymmetries in the halo x - ray emission .",
    "the asymmetry may either be caused by differing wind parameters in both hemispheres , originating for instance from a slight asymmetry of the driving starburst , or by a different structure of the ambient halo medium maclow & mccray 1988 ) .",
    "these explanations may well explain the asymmetry between the se and nw halo , they also may account for the stronger  horns \" in the north than in the south of both hemispheres .",
    "one can , however , think of other possibilities to generate the asymmetry of the  horns \" . there could be more ambient material on the n side of the galaxy to shock - exite ( perhaps due to an earlier fountain episode ? ) , or even the interaction of the halo gas due to the relative motion with the intergalactic medium of the sculptor group of galaxies , of which ngc 253 is a member ( e.g. puche & carignan 1988 ) , could be responsible .",
    "unfortunately , neither the inter - galaxy medium nor the relative motions are known for the sculptor group galaxies to strengthen or reject the latter hypothesis .",
    "the x - ray halo has no equivalent in the optical continuum .",
    "the optical continuum halo mainly follows the elliptical shape of the galactic disk to distances along the major axis of 22.5 kpc ( pence 1980 , beck et al .",
    "1982 ) and is most likely made up of late type stars .",
    "this situation is different for the h@xmath132 emission .",
    "radio images at 330 mhz ( carilli et al .",
    "1992 ) show a synchrotron emitting halo which is more extended perpendicular to the disk and in general matches the soft x - ray halo ( cf .",
    "[ radio ] ) . at radio frequencies of 1.5 ghz ,",
    "the emission is box - shaped similar to the disk corona emission ( hummel et al .",

    "carilli et al .",
    "present evidence for outflow from the disk in a `` spur '' which  corrected for the ngc 253 distance assumed in this paper  rises 2.5 kpc above the plane at about the position of the ne x - ray horn .",
    "detailed comparison of the morphology of the halo emission is hampered by the poorer resolution of the 0.33 ghz radio ( 60  and outermost contour 120 ) with respect to the soft x - ray contours ( 40 ) .",
    "however , there is indication from the overlay that the radio emission does not show the horn - like structure which dominates the x - ray morphology .",
    "so in x - rays , the curvature of the ne horn points at a connection to the nucleus , while the ne radio spur seems to be directly connected to the disk and offset to the north .",
    "radio and x - ray data with better resolution and statistics are urgently needed to clarify these differences , that can not be understood in terms of models put forward for the common origin of the x - ray and radio halo emission . for the ngc 253 radio halo , beck et al .",

    "the separation in disk and halo components proved difficult and was mainly based on the absorbing columns derived from spectral fits .",

    "[ starburst ] one would gather that in view of the halo extent , ngc 253 is not on the low side of the sample .",
    "recently , however , lehnert et al . ( 1999 ) reported emission at a distance of 11.6 kpc for the smaller m82 halo , which they interpret as being due to shock - heating of a massive ionized cloud by the starburst super - wind , which would clearly exceed the ngc 253 halo extent .",
    "apart from ngc 3628 , the temperatures of the halo gas of the other galaxies are higher by a factor of 2 to 3 and the luminosities by up to a factor of 10 implying gas masses larger by up to a factor of 20 .",
    "therefore , it is not the extreme halo properties of ngc 253 , that have pushed it to the front of galaxy halo investigations , but its proximity and low galactic foreground absorption .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the four galaxies in the above sample , besides starburst activity , liner activity has also been discussed , pointing to the presence of an active nucleus .",
    "all four galaxies are members of dense groups , and at least for m82 , ngc 3079 and ngc 3628 it is clear that interactions within the group have most likely initiated the starburst ( and agn ) activity . for ngc 253 , we can not be sure that a recent encounter with neighboring galaxies of the sculptor group has initiated the activity . as an alternative explanation for the starburst , bar activity has been put forward . however again , a ` flyby ' of another sculptor group galaxy might have caused the bar , which in turn may have caused the starburst .",
    "following the detailed analysis of deep rosat hri and pspc observations for x - ray point sources ( paper i ) , we here have characterized the diffuse x - ray emission of this edge - on starburst galaxy .",
    "after subtraction of the point - source contribution we determined the geometry and spectra of the diffuse components and discuss our results in view of observations at other wavelengths and from other galaxies . in detail , x - ray , radio , and h@xmath132 measurements will be compared in a separate paper ( ehle et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * the diffuse x - ray luminosity of ngc 253 is distributed in about equal emission components from nuclear area , disk , and halo and contributes @xmath480% to the total x - ray luminosity of ngc 253 ( l@xmath0 , corrected for foreground absorption ) .",
    "the starburst nucleus itself is highly absorbed and not visible in the rosat band . *",
    "the  nuclear source \" ( x34 ) has an extent of 250 pc ( fwhm ) and is located about 100 pc above the nucleus along the minor axis on the near side of ngc 253 .",
    "it is best described as having a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with a temperature of t = 1.2 kev ( n@xmath1 @xmath2 ) and l@xmath3 ( corrected for galactic foreground absorption ) .",
    "the nuclear source most likely marks the area where the line - of - sight absorption gets low enough that soft x - ray emission from the heated walls of the funnel drilled by the super - wind , can leak through . *",
    "the  x - ray plume \" has a hollow - cone shape ( opening angle of 32  and extent of @xmath4 700 pc along the se minor axis ) .",
    "its spectrum is best modeled by a composite of a thermal bremsstrahlung ( n@xmath5@xmath2 , t = 1.2 kev , l@xmath220 ) and a thin thermal plasma ( galactic foreground absorption , t = 0.33 kev , l@xmath7 ) .",
    "it traces the interaction region between the galactic super - wind and the dense interstellar medium of the disk .",
    "the soft component with just galactic foreground absorption stems from the halo above the disk . *",
    "diffuse emission from the disk is heavily absorbed and follows the spiral structure .",
    "it can be described by a thin thermal plasma spectrum ( t = 0.7 kev , intrinsic luminosity l@xmath8 ) , and most likely reflects a mixture of sources ( x - ray binaries , supernova remnants , and emission from  regions ) and the hot interstellar medium .",
    "the surface brightness profile , with a bright inner and a fainter outer component along the major axis with extents of @xmath93.4 kpc and @xmath97.5 kpc , resembles the 1.46 ghz radio profile . *",
    "the  coronal emission \" originates from the halo immediately above the disk ( scale height @xmath10 kpc ) .",
    "it is only detected from the near side of the disk ( in the se , t = 0.2 kev , l@xmath11 ) , emission from the back ( in the nw ) is shadowed by the intervening interstellar medium causing a pronounced gap in the soft x - ray emission along the nw edge of the optical disk , unambiguously determining the orientation of ngc 253 in space .",
    "the x - ray corona is primarily due to the nuclear superwind that is also responsible for the emission in the outer halo .",
    "an additional component may be due to hot gas ejected by galactic fountains originating within the boiling star - forming disk .",
    "* the emission in the outer halo can be traced to projected distances from the disk of 9 kpc , and shows a horn - like structure .",
    "luminosities are higher ( 10 and @xmath12 , respectively ) and spectra harder in the nw halo than in the se .",
    "the emission most likely originates from a strong galactic wind emanating from the starburst nucleus .",
    "a two temperature thermal plasma model with temperatures of 0.13 and 0.62 kev or a thin thermal plasma model with temperature of 0.15 kev and gaussian components above @xmath40.7 kev and galactic foreground absorption are needed to arrive at acceptable fits for the nw halo .",
    "this may be explained by starburst - driven super - winds or by effects of a non - equilibrium cooling function in a plasma expanding in a fountain or wind .",
    "while ngc 253 does not beat other nearby edge - on starburst galaxies with its x - ray halo parameters , it stands out due to the low foreground , distance , and the favorable inclination , which all together allowed the detection of so many details with rosat . of specific interest",
    "are three questions that only could be touched but not finally answered by rosat and asca / bepposax :    1 .",
    "is the x - ray emission in the outer halo caused by the nuclear super - wind or by hot gas transported into the halo via fountains that are fed from the star forming , boiling disk ?",
    "2 .   can the x - ray spectra of the halo really be described by a delayed recombination model ?",
    "3 .   is the nuclear starburst region responsible for the nuclear and x - ray plume emission or is there a contribution from jet - like activity of a hidden agn ?",
    "these and more questions should be solved with the next generation of x - ray instruments on board xmm - newton and , that will have a broader energy coverage , higher collecting area , and much better spatial and energy resolution . therefore , ngc 253 promises to stay a key object to understand the formation and fueling of hot galaxy halos with future x - ray observations .",

    "<S> spatial and spectral analysis of deep rosat hri and pspc observations of the near edge - on starburst galaxy ngc 253 reveal diffuse soft x - ray emission , which contributes 80% to its total x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath0 , corrected for foreground absorption ) . the nuclear area , disk , and halo contribution to the luminosity is about equal . the starburst nucleus itself is highly absorbed and not visible in the rosat band .    </S>",
    "<S> the emission from the nuclear area stems from a heavily absorbed source with an extent of 250 pc ( fwhm ) about 100 pc above the nucleus along the se minor axis (  nuclear source \" , x34 ) , and the  x - ray plume \" . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear source is best described as having a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with a temperature of t = 1.2 kev ( n@xmath1 @xmath2 ) and l@xmath3   ( corrected for galactic foreground absorption ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the hollow - cone shaped plume ( opening angle of 32  and extent of @xmath4 700 pc along the se minor axis ) is best modeled by a composite of a thermal bremsstrahlung ( n@xmath5@xmath2 , t = 1.2 kev , l@xmath6 ) and a thin thermal plasma ( galactic foreground absorption , t = 0.33 kev , l@xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse nuclear emission components trace interactions between the galactic super - wind emitted by the starburst nucleus , and the dense interstellar medium of the disk .    </S>",
    "<S> diffuse emission from the disk is heavily absorbed and follows the spiral structure . </S>",
    "<S> it can be described by a thin thermal plasma spectrum ( t = 0.7 kev , intrinsic luminosity l@xmath8 ) , and most likely reflects a mixture of sources ( x - ray binaries , supernova remnants , and emission from  regions ) and the hot interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the surface brightness profile reveals a bright inner and a fainter outer component along the major axis with extents of @xmath93.4 kpc and @xmath97.5 kpc .    </S>",
    "<S> we analysed the total halo emission separated into two geometrical areas ; the  corona \" ( scale height @xmath10 kpc ) and the  outer halo \" . the coronal emission ( t = 0.2 kev , l@xmath11 ) </S>",
    "<S> is only detected from the near side of the disk ( in the se ) , emission from the back ( in the nw ) is shadowed by the intervening interstellar medium unambiguously determining the orientation of ngc 253 in space . in the nw </S>",
    "<S> we see the near edge of the disk is seen , but the far component of the halo , and vice versa in the se . </S>",
    "<S> the emission in the outer halo can be traced to projected distances from the disk of 9 kpc , and shows a horn - like structure . </S>",
    "<S> luminosities are higher ( 10 and @xmath12 , respectively ) and spectra harder in the nw halo than in the se . </S>",
    "<S> the emission in the corona and outer halo is most likely caused by a strong galactic wind emanating from the starburst nucleus . as an additional contribution to the coronal emission floating on the disk like a spectacle - glass , we propose hot gas fueled from galactic fountains originating within the boiling star - forming disk . </S>",
    "<S> a two temperature thermal plasma model with temperatures of 0.13 and 0.62 kev or a thin thermal plasma model with temperature of 0.15 kev and gaussian components above @xmath40.7 kev and galactic foreground absorption are needed to arrive at acceptable fits for the nw halo . </S>",
    "<S> this may be explained by starburst - driven super - winds or by effects of a non - equilibrium cooling function in a plasma expanding in fountains or winds .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results to observations at other wavelengths and from other galaxies . </S>"
