    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most promising extensions of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite since , among other things , it solves the hierarchy problem , provides a natural candidate for dark matter _ etc_.",
    "it also introduces many new sources of cp violation that may be needed to explain baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "these phases , if large @xmath3 , can cause problems with satisfying experimental bounds on lepton , neutron and mercury edms  @xcite .",
    "this can be overcome by pushing sfermion spectra above a tev scale or arranging internal cancelations @xcite .",
    "most unambiguous way to detect the presence of cp - violating phases would be to study cp - odd observables measurable at future accelerators  the lhc and the ilc .",
    "such observables in the chargino sector are , for example , triple products of momenta of initial electrons , charginos and their decay products @xcite .",
    "however they require polarized initial electron / positron beams or measurement of chargino polarization .    in this talk we present another possibility of detecting cp - violating phases in the chargino sector .",
    "as it was recently pointed out @xcite , in non - diagonal chargino pair production @xmath4 a cp - odd observable can be constructed beyond tree - level from production cross section without polarized @xmath0 beams or measurement of chargino polarization .",
    "we show here the results of the full one - loop calculation of this effect . in the reaction  ( [ produkcja ] )",
    "the cp violation can be induced by the complex higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 or complex trilinear coupling in top squark sector @xmath2 . since these asymmetries",
    "can reach a few percent , they can be detected in simple event - counting experiments at future colliders .",
    "in @xmath0 collisions charginos are produced at tree - level via the @xmath5-channel @xmath6 exchange and @xmath7-channel @xmath8 exchange . as it was shown in @xcite no cp violation effects",
    "can be observed at the tree - level for the production processes of diagonal @xmath9 and non - diagonal @xmath10 chargino pairs without the measurement of polarization of final chargino .",
    "however the situation is different for non - diagonal production if we go beyond tree - level approximation .",
    "radiative corrections to the chargino pair production include the following generic one - loop feynman diagrams : the virtual vertex corrections , the self - energy corrections to the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 propagators , and the box diagrams contributions .",
    "we also have to include corrections on external chargino legs .",
    "one - loop corrected matrix element squared is given by @xmath14 accordingly , the one - loop cp asymmetry for the non - diagonal chargino pair is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 denote cross sections for production of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "since the asymmetry vanishes at tree - level it has to be finite at one loop , hence no renormalization is needed .",
    "vs.  center of mass energy .",

    "( [ cpasym ] ) arises due to the interference between complex couplings , which in our case are due to complex mixing matrices of charginos or stops , and non - trivial imaginary part from feynman diagrams  the absorptive part .",
    "such contributions appear when some of the intermediate state particles in loop diagrams go on - shell .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : thrs_scan ] where the contribution to @xmath20 from double selectron exchange appears at the threshold for selectron pair production at @xmath21  gev .",
    "for the numerical results in this section we use two parameter sets ( a ) and ( b ) with gaugino / higgsino mass parameters defined as follows at the low scale : @xmath22 and with @xmath23 .",
    "this gives the following chargino masses : @xmath24 for the sfermion mass parameters in scenario ( a ) we assume @xmath25 and for the sfermion trilinear coupling : @xmath26 .",
    "scenario ( b ) is for comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite for which we take @xmath27    in our numerical analysis we consider the dependence of the asymmetry ( [ cpasym ] ) on the phase of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath28 and soft trilinear top squark coupling @xmath29 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the cp asymmetry in scenario ( a ) as a function of the phase of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , left and middle panel , respectively .",
    "contributions due to box corrections , vertex corrections and self energy corrections have been plotted in addition to the full result . in this scenario",
    "the asymmetry can reach @xmath30 for the @xmath1 parameter and @xmath31 for @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we note that for the asymmetry due to the non - zero phase of the higgsino mass parameter there are significant cancelations among various contributions .",
