    "the analysis of financial data by methods developed for physical systems has a long tradition@xcite and has recently attracted the interest of physicists . among the reasons for this interest",
    "is the scientific challenge of understanding the dynamics of a strongly fluctuating complex system with a large number of interacting elements .",
    "in addition , it is possible that the experience gained by studying complex physical systems might yield new results in economics .",
    "financial markets are complex dynamical systems with many interacting elements that can be grouped into two categories : ( i ) the _ traders _  such as individual investors , mutual funds , brokerage firms , and banks  and ( ii ) the _ assets _  such as bonds , stocks , futures , and options . interactions between these elements lead to transactions mediated by the stock exchange .",
    "the details of each transaction are recorded for later analysis .",
    "the dynamics of a financial market are difficult to understand not only because of the complexity of its internal elements but also because of the many intractable external factors acting on it , which may even differ from market to market . remarkably , the statistical properties of certain observables appear to be similar for quite different markets@xcite , consistent with the possibility that there may exist `` universal '' results .",
    "the most challenging difficulty in the study of a financial market is that the nature of the interactions between the different elements comprising the system is unknown , as is the way in which external factors affect it .",
    "therefore , as a starting point , one may resort to empirical studies to help uncover the regularities or `` empirical laws '' that may govern financial markets .",
    "the interactions between the different elements comprising financial markets generate many observables such as the transaction price , the share volume traded , the trading frequency , and the values of market indices [ fig .",
    "[ sp500_brownian ] ] .",
    "a number of studies investigated the time series of returns on varying time scales @xmath0 in order to probe the nature of the stochastic process underlying it  . for a time series @xmath9 of prices or market index values ,",
    "the return @xmath10 over a time scale @xmath0 is defined as the forward change in the logarithm of @xmath9@xcite , @xmath11 for small changes in @xmath9 , the return @xmath12 is approximately the forward relative change , @xmath13    in 1900 , bachelier proposed the first model for the stochastic process of returns  an uncorrelated random walk with independent , identically gaussian distributed ( _ i.i.d _ ) random variables@xcite .",
    "this model is natural if one considers the return over a time scale @xmath0 to be the result of many independent `` shocks '' , which then lead by the central limit theorem to a gaussian distribution of returns  @xcite .",
    "however , empirical studies @xcite show that the distribution of returns@xcite has pronounced tails in striking contrast to that of a gaussian . to illustrate this fact ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ gt_brownian ] the 10@xmath3min returns of the s&p 500 market index@xcite for 1986 - 1987 and contrast it with a sequence of _ i.i.d . _ gaussian random variables . both are normalized to have unit variance .",
    "clearly , large events are very frequent in the data , a fact largely underestimated by a gaussian process . despite this empirical fact",
    ", the gaussian assumption for the distribution of returns is widely used in theoretical finance because of the simplifications it provides in analytical calculation ; indeed , it is one of the assumptions used in the classic black - scholes option pricing formula@xcite .    in his pioneering analysis of cotton prices",
    ", mandelbrot observed that in addition to being non - gaussian , the process of returns shows another interesting property : `` time scaling ''  that is , the distributions of returns for various choices of @xmath0 , ranging from 1  day up to 1  month have similar functional forms@xcite .",
    "motivated by ( i ) pronounced tails , and ( ii ) a stable functional form for different time scales , mandelbrot@xcite proposed that the distribution of returns is consistent with a lvy stable distribution@xcite  that is , the returns can be modeled as a lvy stable process .",
    "lvy stable distributions arise from the generalization of the central limit theorem to random variables which do not have a finite second moment [ see appendix a ] .",
    "conclusive results on the distribution of returns are difficult to obtain , and require a large amount of data to study the rare events that give rise to the tails .",
    "more recently , the availability of high frequency data on financial market indices , and the advent of improved computing capabilities , has facilitated the probing of the asymptotic behavior of the distribution .",
    "for these reasons , recent empirical studies@xcite of the s&p 500 index@xcite analyze typically @xmath14@xmath15 data points , in contrast to approximately 2000 data points analyzed in the classic work of mandelbrot@xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite reports that the central part of the distribution of s&p 500 returns appears to be well fit by a lvy distribution , but the asymptotic behavior of the distribution of returns shows faster decay than predicted by a lvy distribution . hence , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a truncated lvy distribution  a lvy distribution in the central part followed by an approximately exponential truncation  as a model for the distribution of returns .",
    "the exponential truncation ensures the existence of a finite second moment , and hence the truncated lvy distribution is not a stable distribution  @xcite . the truncated lvy process with _ i.i.d .",
    "_ random variables has slow convergence to gaussian behavior due to the lvy distribution in the center , which could explain the observed time scaling for a considerable range of time scales@xcite .",
    "in addition to the probability distribution , a complementary aspect for the characterization of any stochastic process is the quantification of correlations .",
    "studies of the autocorrelation function of returns show exponential decay with characteristic decay times @xmath16 of only 4@xmath3min@xcite . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ acorsp](a ) , for time scales beyond 20 @xmath3min the correlation function is at the level of noise , in agreement with the _ efficient market hypothesis _ which states that is not possible to predict future stock prices from their previous values@xcite . if price - correlations were not short - range , one could devise a way to make money from the market indefinitely .",
    "it is important to note that lack of linear correlation does not imply an _ i.i.d .",
    "_ process for the returns , since there may exist higher - order correlations [ fig  [ acorsp](b ) ] .",
    "indeed , the amplitude of the returns , referred to in economics as the _ volatility_@xcite , shows long - range time correlations that persist up to several months , and are characterized by an asymptotic power - law decay .",
    "a recent preliminary study reported that the distributions of 5@xmath3min returns for 1000 individual stocks and the s&p 500 index decay as a power - law with an exponent well outside the stable lvy regime@xcite .",
    "consistent results were found by studies both on stock markets  @xcite and on foreign exchange markets@xcite .",
    "these results raise two important questions :    first , the distribution of returns has a finite second moment , thus , we would expect it to converge to a gaussian because of the central limit theorem . on the other hand ,",
    "preliminary studies suggest the distributions of returns retain their power - law functional form for long time scales .",
    "so , we can ask which of these two scenarios is correct ?",
    "we find that the distributions of returns retain their functional form for time scales up to approximately 4  days , after which we find results consistent with a slow convergence to gaussian behavior .",
    "second , power - law distributions are not stable distributions , but the distribution of returns retains its functional form for a range of time scales .",
    "it is then natural to ask how can this _ scaling behavior _ possibly arise ?",
    "one possible explanation is the recently - proposed exponentially - truncated lvy distribution@xcite .",
    "however , the truncated lvy process is constructed out of _ i.i.d . _ random variables and hence is not consistent with the empirically - observed long persistence in the autocorrelation function of the volatility of returns  . moreover",
    ", our data support the possibility that the asymptotic nature of the distribution is a power - law with an exponent outside the lvy regime .",
    "also , we will argue that the scaling behavior observed in the distribution of returns may be connected to the slow decay of the volatility correlations .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section iii describes the data analyzed .",
    "sections iv and v study the distribution of returns of the s&p 500 index on time scales @xmath17  day and @xmath18  day , respectively .",
    "section vi discusses how time correlations in volatility are related to the time scaling of the distributions , and sect .",
    "vii presents concluding remarks .",
    "first , we analyze the s&p 500 index , which comprises 500 companies chosen for market size , liquidity , and industry group representation in the us . the s&p 500 is a market - value weighted index ( stock price times number of shares outstanding ) , with each stock s weight proportional to its market value .",
    "the s&p 500 index is one of the most widely used benchmarks of u.s . equity performance . in our study , we first analyze database ( i ) which contains `` high - frequency '' data that covers the 13 years period 19841996 , with a recording frequency of less than 1  min .",
    "the total number of records in this database exceeds @xmath19 . to investigate longer time scales",
    ", we study two other databases . database ( ii )",
    "contains daily records of the s&p 500 index for the 35-year period 19621996 , and database ( iii ) contains monthly records for the 71-year period 19261996 .    in order to test if our results are limited to the s&p 500 index , we perform a parallel analysis on two other market indices .",
    "database ( iv ) contains 3560 daily records of the nikkei index of the tokyo stock exchange for the 14-year period 19841997 , and database ( v ) contains 4649 daily records of the hang - seng index of the hong kong stock exchange for the 18-year period 19801997 .",
    "first , we analyze the values of the s&p500 index from the high - frequency data for the 13-year period 19841996 , which extends the database studied in ref .  @xcite by an additional 7 years . the data are typically recorded at 15  second intervals .",
    "we first sample the data at 1  min intervals and generate a time series @xmath9 with approximately 1.2  million data points . from the time series @xmath9 , we compute the return @xmath21 which is the relative change in the index , defined in eq .",

    "figure  [ sp500_hist](a ) shows the cumulative distribution of returns for @xmath20  min . for both positive and negative tails ,",

    "consistent values for @xmath7 are also obtained from the density function . for a more accurate estimation of the asymptotic behavior , we use the modified hill estimator [ fig .  [ sp500_hill](a ,",
    "we obtain estimates for the asymptotic slope in the region @xmath28 : @xmath31    for the region @xmath32 , regression fits yield smaller estimates of @xmath7 , consistent with the possibility of a lvy distribution in the central region .",
    "the values of @xmath7 obtained in this range are quite sensitive to the bounds of the region used for fitting .",
    "our estimates range from @xmath33 up to @xmath34 for different fitting regions in the interval @xmath35 .",
    "for example , in the region @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath37 which are consistent with the result @xmath38 found for small values of @xmath39 in ref .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the estimates of @xmath7 were calculated using the scaling form of the return probability to the origin @xmath40 .",
    "it is possible that for the financial data analyzed here , @xmath40 is not the optimal statistic , because of the discreteness of the individual - company distributions that comprise it@xcite .",
    "it is also possible that our values of @xmath7 for small values of @xmath39 could be due to the discreteness in the returns of the individual companies comprising the s&p 500 .",
    "next , we study the distribution of normalized returns for longer time scales . figure  [ sp500_scl](a ) shows the cumulative distribution of normalized s&p 500 returns for time scales up to 512  min ( approximately 1.5  days ) .",
    "the distribution appears to retain its power - law functional form for these time scales .",
    "we verify this scaling behavior by analyzing the moments of the distribution of normalized returns @xmath39 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes an average over all the normalized returns for all the bins . since @xmath5 , we expect @xmath43 to diverge for @xmath44 , and hence we compute @xmath43 for @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ sp500_scl](b ) shows the moments of the normalized returns @xmath39 for different time scales from 5  min up to 1  day .",

    "this is also visible for the moments [ fig .",
    "[ sp_scl_brk](b ) ] .",
    "the s&p 500 is but one of the many stock market indices .",
    "hence , we investigate if the above results regarding the power - law asymptotic behavior of the distribution of returns hold for other market indices as well .",
    "figure  [ universality ] compares the distributions of daily returns for the nikkei index of the tokyo stock exchange and the hang - seng index of the hong kong stock exchange with that of the s&p 500 .",
    "the distributions have similar functional forms , suggesting the possibility of `` universal '' behavior of these distributions .",
    "in addition , the estimates of @xmath7 from regression fits , @xmath50 are in good agreement for the three cases .",

    "[ acorsp](c ) .",
    "we find a power - law dependence , @xmath52 we estimate @xmath53 for time scales @xmath54 min . this value is larger than @xmath55 due to the exponentially - damped time correlations , which are significant up to approximately 20  min . beyond 20  min , @xmath56 , indicating the absence of correlations in the returns , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ acorsp](a ) .",

    "previous explanations of scaling relied on lvy stable@xcite and exponentially - truncated lvy processes@xcite . however , the empirical data that we analyze are not consistent with either of these two processes .      here",
    ", we compare the rate of convergence of the probability of the returns to that of a computer - generated time series which has the same distribution but is statistically independent by construction .",
    "this way , we will be able to study the convergence to gaussian behavior of independent random variables distributed as a power - law , with an exponent @xmath5 .",

    "we next calculate the new random variables @xmath59 , and compute the cumulative distributions of @xmath60 for increasing values of @xmath61 .",

    "[ sim_pow4](a ) ] .",
    "this convergence is also visible in the moments .",
    "figures  [ sim_pow4](a , b ) show that for @xmath62 , both the moments and the cumulative distribution show gaussian behavior .",
    "in contrast , for the distribution of returns , we observe significantly slower convergence to gaussian behavior : in the case of the s&p 500 index , one observes a possible onset of convergence for @xmath63  4  days ( 1560  mins ) , starting from 1@xmath3min returns .",
    "these results confirm the existence of time dependencies in the returns .",
    "next , we show that the scaling behavior observed for the s&p 500 index no longer holds when we destroy the dependencies between the returns at different times .",
    "we start with the 1@xmath3min returns and then destroy all the time dependencies that might be present by shuffling the time series of @xmath64 , thereby creating a new time series @xmath65 which contains _ statistically - independent _ returns . by adding up @xmath61 consecutive returns of the shuffled series @xmath65 , we construct the @xmath61@xmath3min returns @xmath66 .",

    "we find a progressive convergence to gaussian behavior with increasing @xmath61 .",
    "this convergence to gaussian behavior is also clear in the moments of @xmath67 , which rapidly approach the gaussian values with increasing @xmath61 [ fig .",
    "[ sp_shuffle](b ) ] .",
    "this rapid convergence confirms that the time dependencies cause the observed scaling behavior .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the distribution of returns for market indices , for time intervals @xmath0 ranging over roughly 4 orders of magnitude , from 1@xmath3min up to 1 month ( @xmath68  16,000  min ) .",
    "we find that the distribution of returns is consistent with a power - law asymptotic behavior , characterized by an exponent @xmath5 , well outside the stable lvy regime @xmath69 . for time scales @xmath70 , where @xmath8  days , our results are consistent with slow convergence to gaussian behavior .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the scaling behavior does not hold if we destroy all the time dependencies by shuffling .",
    "the breakdown of the scaling behavior of the distribution of returns upon shuffling the time series suggests that the long - range volatility correlations , which persist up to several months , may be one possible reason for the observed scaling behavior .",
    "recent studies  @xcite show that the distribution of volatility is consistent with an asymptotic power - law behavior with exponent 3 , just as observed for the distribution of returns .",
    "this finding suggests that the process of returns may be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the return at time @xmath73 , @xmath74 denotes the volatility , and @xmath75 is an _ i.i.d . _",
    "random variable _ independent _ of @xmath74 .",
    "since the asymptotic behavior of the distributions of @xmath74 and @xmath72 is consistent with power - law behavior , @xmath75 should have an asymptotic behavior with faster decay than either @xmath72 or @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ garch ] ) is central to all the arch models  @xcite , with @xmath75 assumed to be gaussian distributed .",
    "different arch processes assume different recursion relations for @xmath74 . in the standard arch model , @xmath76 , leading to a power law distribution of returns with exponent depending on the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath77 .",
    "however , the standard arch process predicts a volatility correlation that decays exponentially , since @xmath74 depends only on the previous event , and can not account for the observed long - range persistence in @xmath74 . to try to remedy this",
    ", one can require @xmath74 to depend not only on the previous value of @xmath72 but on a finite number of past events .",
    "this generalization is called the garch model .",
    "dependence of @xmath74 on the finite past leads not to a power - law decay ( as is observed empirically ) , but to volatility correlations that decay exponentially with larger decay times as the number of events `` remembered '' is increased .    in order to explain the long range persistence of the autocorrelation function of the volatility",
    ", one must assume that @xmath74 depends on all the past rather than a finite number of past events  @xcite .",
    "such a description would be consistent with the empirical finding of long - range correlations in the volatility , and the observation that the distributions of @xmath72 and @xmath74 have similar asymptotic forms . if the process of returns were governed by the volatility , as in eq .",
    "( [ garch ] ) , then the volatility would seem to be the more fundamental process .",
    "in fact , it is possible that the volatility is a measure of the amount of information arriving into the market , and that the statistical properties of the returns may be `` driven '' by this information .",
