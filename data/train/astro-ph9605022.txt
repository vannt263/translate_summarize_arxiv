    "the instruments on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) have revealed that the gamma - ray sky is rich and exciting .",
    "over 100 point sources of gamma - rays have been detected by the egret detector on the cgro at energies up to 20 gev @xcite .",
    "gamma - rays are detected from objects such as bursts , pulsars ( e.g. crab and vela ) , active galactic nuclei ( e.g. 3c279 , mrk 421 ) , and nearby galaxies ( e.g. lmc ) , but the majority of the sources are still unidentified with known objects . largely due to its limited collection area , the egret instrument lacks sufficient sensitivity to detect sources above 20 gev .",
    "ground - based telescopes have detected tev gamma - rays from a handful of objects ( e.g. crab , mrk 421 ) .",
    "the detections clearly demonstrate that gamma - ray astronomy can be done from the ground using the atmospheric cherenkov technique @xcite . however , the current generation of atmospheric cherenkov telescopes is limited by signal - to - noise considerations to operate at energies above 250 gev .",
    "therefore , an important goal in gamma - ray astronomy is the exploration of the energy region between 20 and 250 gev .",
    "this region is one of the last remaining windows of the electromagnetic spectrum where no observations have been made .",
    "we would like to search this window for possible new astrophysical phenomena , and would like to connect observations made at low energies by satellite experiments ( such as egret ) with ones made at high energies by ground - based observatories .",
    "these are the most important scientific motivations for the development of gamma - ray telescopes in this energy regime @xcite .",
    "although the earth s atmosphere is opaque to gamma - radiation , the products of extensive air showers created by gamma - rays can be detected at ground level .",
    "high energy gamma - rays interact in the upper atmosphere and produce electromagnetic cascades consisting largely of electrons , positrons , and photons .",
    "the relativistic electrons and positrons emit cherenkov radiation which is beamed to the ground .",
    "the cherenkov photons hit the ground with a narrow spread in arrival times ( @xmath0nsec ) and form a circular light pool approximately 250@xmath1 m across .",
    "atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , using mirrors and fast photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , detect these photons to reconstruct the energy and direction of the primary gamma - ray .",
    "the atmospheric cherenkov technique has been successfully used for gamma - ray astronomy at energies from 250 gev to 10 tev by several observatories , such as whipple ( u.s . ) , cangaroo ( australia ) , and thmis ( france ) .",
    "although there are a large number of cherenkov photons reaching the ground in an air shower , the photons are spread out over a large area , leading to small densities at any given ground location .",
    "for example , a shower created by a vertically incident 50 gev gamma - ray contains , on average , more than 200,000 photons at ground level . however , the mean density within 150@xmath1 m of the shower axis is only @xmath2 photons / m@xmath3 .",
    "small density values require large mirror collection areas in order to concentrate enough cherenkov light onto the detecting elements of a telescope .",
    "the energy threshold of a cherenkov telescope is set by its ability to trigger on a signal of cherenkov photons amidst the background of night sky photons .",
    "if we assume that the energy threshold , @xmath4 , depends on the minimum signal - to - noise ratio required for triggering , we can derive the approximate way in which the threshold depends on the telescope parameters :    @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the flux of night sky photons , @xmath7 is the solid angle viewed by the detecting element , @xmath8 is the trigger time window . @xmath9",
    "is the telescope mirror area , and @xmath10 is the efficiency of light collection @xcite .",
    "we can reduce the energy threshold of a cherenkov telescope by minimizing the background light level , the field - of - view , and the trigger time window . or by maximizing the photon collection efficiency and the mirror area .",
    "there are practical limitations on reducing the field - of - view or time window that are imposed by the physics of the shower . a minimimum field - of - view of @xmath11 ( full angle ) is required to contain most of the cherenkov image .",
    "the time window can not be reduced much below a few nsec , which is the characteristic width of the cherenkov pulse . the most straight - forward way to lower",
    "the energy threshold is to increase the amount of mirror collection area .",
    "ground - based telescopes using the air shower technique must contend with a large background of showers initiated by isotropic cosmic rays .",
    "this background flux is typically two to three orders of magnitude larger than gamma - ray fluxes . in order to reliably detect high energy gamma - rays",
    ", cherenkov telescopes must reject a significant fraction of the cosmic ray showers . at primary energies below 100 gev ,",
    "substantial rejection comes from the fact that cosmic ray showers contain much less cherenkov light than showers initiated by gamma - rays . in cosmic ray showers ,",
    "a large fraction of the total energy goes into products ( hadrons , muons , neutrinos ) which do not produce cherenkov radiation , whereas in gamma - ray showers , all the energy goes into the electromagnetic cascade .",
    "a second observation is that showers produced by cosmic rays are much more chaotic and irregular in development than those initiated by gamma - rays .",
    "these development characteristics translate into significant differences between gamma - ray and cosmic ray showers in the angular and lateral distributions of the cherenkov light .",
    "atmospheric cherenkov detectors that exploit these shower features are able to reject a substantial fraction of the cosmic ray showers . for example , the whipple observatory has used an imaging technique to reject over 99% of the cosmic ray background .",
    "this technique led to the first convincing ground - based detection of gramma - rays @xcite .",
    "current state - of - the - art atmospheric cherenkov telescopes have mirror areas @xmath12m@xmath3 , and energy thresholds of @xmath13 gev .",
    "these experiments sample only a small fraction of the available cherenkov light .",
    "recently , designs for a number of new large area cherenkov detectors have been suggested .",
    "one design concept ( vhegra ) makes use of large ( 10 m diameter ) reflectors in which each reflector has its own pmt camera @xcite .",
    "another group ( telescope array ) is developing a telescope consisting of more than one hundred small ( @xmath14 m diameter ) reflectors @xcite . in this design",
    ", each reflector would have a camera of sixteen multi - anode pmts . a third design concept consists of one ( or more ) large hemispherical reflectors or `` bowls '' constructed by filling the insides of a cavity in the ground with mirrors @xcite . in the most ambitious version of this design ,",
    "the cavity would be 300 to 400@xmath1 m across , and a large camera , suspended at the mirror focal point , would follow astronomical sources by rotating to view different parts of the sky .    in each of the design concepts mentioned above , the price of the reflectors themselves dominates the overall cost of the experiment .",
    "we are developing an atmospheric cherenkov detector that makes use of the large mirror area available at central tower solar plants .",
    "the great advantage here is that the mirrors have already been built and are available .",
    "the idea to use large solar arrays for collecting cherenkov radiation from air showers was introduced more than a decade ago with application to the solar reflector ( heliostat ) field of the national solar tower test facility ( nsttf ) at sandia national laboratories ( albuquerque nm , usa ) @xcite .",
    "the original design concept was to reflect cherenkov light from heliostats onto a camera of pmts located on top of the central tower , viewing the heliostat field .",
    "this design had a number of technical problems : 1 ) the large ( @xmath15 m diameter ) cherenkov image sizes produced by the heliostats required very large pmts , 2 ) each pmt saw light from more than one heliostat , and 3 ) designing a detector trigger was difficult because the time of propagation for light from a heliostat to the tower varied , depending on the position of the heliostat and on the inclination angle of the shower .    in 1990 , members of our group proposed a gamma - ray observatory using the large heliostat array of the solar two power plant ( daggett ca , usa ) @xcite .",
    "the proposal suggested the use of an optical secondary located on the central tower . here",
    ", the secondary ( either a large mirror or fresnel lens ) serves two important tasks .",
    "first , it acts to focus the light from each heliostat down to a small spot that can be collected by a conventional ( 1 - 2 \" ) pmt .",
    "second , it creates an image of the heliostat field in the focal plane of the secondary .",
    "each heliostat is imaged to an unique location in the image plane . in this way",
    ", each pmt sees the light from only one heliostat .",
    "the use of secondary optics therefore solves the first two problems associated with the original design concept @xcite .",
    "the problem of varying time delays remains , but the use of secondary optics allows each pmt to have its own unique delay circuit .    to form an overall experiment trigger , the pmt signals from the heliostats would be selectively delayed and combined .",
    "two possible delay schemes can be imagined .",
    "the first scheme would delay the pmt analog signals by means of good quality coaxial cables .",
    "the variation in delay lengths would be achieved by programmable switches , and a trigger would be formed from the analog sum of the signals .",
    "the second scheme would discriminate the pmt signals at low levels .",
    "the digitally delayed discriminator outputs would be combined to form an overall trigger .",
    "in addition to lowering the energy threshold , the use of an array of mirrors also permits measurement of the lateral distribution of the cherenkov light .",
    "as discussed earlier , this distribution can be used to provide separation between showers initiated by gamma - ray and cosmic ray ( hadronic ) primaries .",
    "we are currently examining the degree of separation that could be achieved from a hypothetical large area cherenkov array using monte carlo simulations .",
    "since 1993 , considerable interest has arisen in the possibility of atmospheric cherenkov telescopes built around solar heliostat arrays .",
    "there are now two groups developing prototype experiments based on this design concept .",
    "some of us ( jq and das ) are involved with a french group initiating an experiment to use up to 180 heliostats of the thmis solar power plant near targasonne in the eastern pyrnes @xcite .",
    "the remainder are developing a prototype experiment to use either the solar two power plant or the national solar tower test facility . to understand the feasibility of the design concept , we have carried out a program of tests at the solar two site .",
    "the results from this program , which started in april 1994 , are the subject of this paper .",
    "the solar two power plant was constructed from 1979 to 1992 , and is located @xmath16 km east of barstow ca , usa ( 34.9@xmath1n , 116.3@xmath1w , 593@xmath1 m above sea level ) .",
    "solar two consists of 1818 heliostats spread out around a central tower , covering an area of approximately 200,000@xmath1m@xmath3 .",
    "each heliostat has its own altitude - azimuth drive and local circuitry for tracking control .",
    "a heliostat mirror is composed of twelve facets with a total reflective surface of 40@xmath1m@xmath3 .",
    "the heliostats can be controlled from computers at a central location , or via a specialized interface using a lap - top personal computer .    after a test and evaluation phase ,",
    "the plant was used for power production until 1988 .",
    "recently , a consortium of private and government sponsors formed to refurbish the plant and to resume solar energy production .",
    "the refurbishment of the plant started at the end of 1994 , and was completed in november 1995 . among other improvements carried out ,",
    "each heliostat was inspected , ( if necessary ) repaired , and brought into good optical alignment .",
    "the refurbishment of the plant has therefore had an important beneficial impact on its potential as an astronomical site .",
    "the solar two facility will resume operations for solar power in early 1996 as part of a several - year program .",
    "we now describe the technical progress that has been made on our design concept . in april 1994",
    ", we started a testing program at the solar two site .",
    "the initial goals of this program were to : 1 ) characterize the properties of the heliostats , 2 ) determine the suitability of the site for astronomical purposes , and 3 ) demonstrate that cherenkov radiation can be reliably detected above background using solar heliostats .",
    "we accomplished each of these initial goals during tests carried out in 1994 .      in april and august 1994",
    ", we spent ten days at the solar two site studying the performance of the heliostats and making measurements of the night sky brightness .",
    "the results from these studies have been presented elsewhere @xcite , and therefore , are only briefly discussed here :    1 .",
    "the tracking and pointing accuracies of the heliostats were measured directly using a laser .",
    "the heliostats track smoothly to an accuracy of better than @xmath17 .",
    "the optical properties of several heliostats were determined by reflecting sunlight onto a target at the top of the central tower .",
    "after suitable alignment of the individual mirror facets , the heliostat spot sizes at the tower were measured to be less than 3.0 meters in diameter .",
    "since the angular size of the sun ( @xmath18 ) is comparable to the angular extent of the cherenkov light in a shower , the measured spot sizes determine the optimal diameter of the secondary .",
    "direct photometric measurements of the night sky brightness due to local light pollution were made from the triggering rate of a collimated pmt .",
    "although light pollution near the horizon was high , the brightness looking down into the heliostat field ( where the secondary optics would point ) was within 50% of that found at a dark location such as dugway , utah , site of the chicago air shower array ( casa ) and fly s eye experiments .",
    "the results from these studies encouraged us to build a detector to see atmospheric cherenkov radiation .",
    "a schematic representation of the detector is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] .",
    "high energy cosmic rays interact in the upper atmosphere ( @xmath19 km altitude ) to create extensive air showers .",
    "the cherenkov light in the shower propagates to ground level .",
    "the primary optic consisted of four solar heliostats with a total reflective area of @xmath20m@xmath3 .",
    "the heliostats reflected cherenkov radiation to a camera box on the central tower .",
    "the camera consisted of a secondary optic ( fresnel lens ) and photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "the pmt signals were electronically recorded by a data acquisition ( daq ) system .",
    "we selected four heliostats @xcite in the northeast quadrant of the solar two heliostat field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] .",
    "the heliostats were approximately halfway out into the field and were chosen to lie along a circular arc so that each heliostat was at the same approximate distance from the tower . in this way , there were no relative differences in the light propagation times from the heliostats to the tower for vertically incident showers .",
    "the mirror facets of the selected heliostats were washed and aligned using the image of the sun on a large target on the tower .",
    "the azimuth and elevation headings of the heliostats were controlled using a custom - made interface module @xcite and a lap - top personal computer .",
    "the camera box was made from an aluminum frame of dimensions 32 \" x 42 \" x 84 \" .",
    "aluminum panels painted black covered the frame to make a light - tight enclosure .",
    "a shutter attachment was mounted at one end of the box ( along the major axis ) .",
    "this attachment held a 31 `` x 41 '' x 3/16 \" fresnel lens ( edmund scientific g31,139 ) and a removable wooden shutter .",
    "the lens had a focal length of 40 \" and a typical transmission of 85% for wavelengths between 400 and 1000 nm .",
    "four fast 2 \" photomultiplier tubes ( hamamatsu r2154-uv ) were mounted at the focal plane of the fresnel lens so that the images of four heliostats were focused onto the pmts ( one heliostat per pmt ) .",
    "the pmts were operated with the cathode at negative high voltage ( typically -1.05 kv ) , and with a typical current amplification of @xmath21 .",
    "the high voltage was provided by a 32-channel programmable supply ( lecroy 4032 ) .      a schematic diagram of the electronic circuitry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : electronics ] . the electronics consisted of commercial modules using the nim and camac standards .",
    "the pmt signals were carried to the electronics via @xmath22 m of coaxial cable ( rg-58a / u ) .",
    "the signals were ac - coupled through amplifiers ( lecroy 612am ) with a signal gain of ten .",
    "we used amplifiers in order to keep the pmt gains below @xmath23 .",
    "the amplified signals were delayed by @xmath24 m of coaxial cable ( rg-8/u ) , and their charges were measured by analog - to - digital converters ( adcs ) .",
    "the adcs ( lecroy 2249w ) had 11-bit resolution , a conversion scale of @xmath25pc / count , and were gated by a @xmath26nsec wide pulse .",
    "the amplified signals were also discriminated ( lecroy 623b ) at discriminator levels between @xmath27mv and @xmath28mv .",
    "the discriminated outputs were used to form a trigger coincidence , and to stop time - to - digital converters ( tdcs ) .",
    "the tdcs ( lecroy 2228a ) had a dynamic range of 11-bits with a least count value of @xmath29psec .",
    "the trigger logic ( lecroy 365 ) required the overlap of at least three ( out of four ) @xmath26ns wide pulses .",
    "the trigger rates for three and four - fold coincidences , as well as the pmt single counting rates , were recorded by scalers ( lecroy 2551 ) .",
    "an important part of the electronic circuitry was a veto circuit designed to eliminate the effects of background light produced by man - made sources .",
    "the most significant sources of this type were aircraft warning beacons at a neighboring power plant ( located 3 km southwest of the solar two site ) .",
    "these beacons produced flashes of light which were intense , but which occurred at a low repetition rate ( @xmath30 1 hz ) .",
    "the pmt pulses caused by the flashes were much longer in duration than cherenkov signals ( @xmath31sec versus @xmath32nsec ) .",
    "therefore , a veto circuit based on pulse length could be used to inhibit the trigger logic during noise pulses .",
    "the veto circuit was made by splitting the amplified signal from each pmt into two paths .",
    "along one path , the signal was delayed through @xmath33 m of coaxial cable ( rg-58a / u ) . along the other path ,",
    "an updating discriminator ( phillips 711 ) was used to indicate the presence of a signal that remained over threshold for more than 100nsec . in this manner ,",
    "all spurious long pulses were eliminated from the trigger .",
    "the trigger signal generated a gate for the adcs and a common start for the tdcs .",
    "the data recorded in the adcs and tdcs were digitized and read out through a 16-bit parallel camac interface ( kinetic systems 3922 ) to an intel 286-based personal computer .",
    "the data were acquired on a local hard disk and then transferred via modem to a remote unix workstation .",
    "the data used in this work were taken on two moonless nights ( november 4 and 5 , 1994 ) . on the first night , the weather conditions were good , with clear skies and a wind speed less than 20 mph at ground level .",
    "on the second night , there was a significant amount of high level haze .",
    "before the tests started , we studied the pointing of each heliostat by locating the image of the sun on the tower .",
    "we recalibrated the absolute heliostat pointing for each night of operation .    at the start of nighttime operation ,",
    "high voltage was applied to the pmts , but the camera shutter was kept closed .",
    "the pmt single counting rates and three - fold and four - fold coincidence rates were measured for a range of different discriminator settings .",
    "we repeated these measurements with the camera shutter open , but with the heliostats oriented randomly in the sky ( i.e. with the heliostats not pointed to a common location ) .",
    "finally , the heliostats were aligned to a common point in the sky .",
    "the trigger rates and pulse - height distributions were recorded for various discriminator settings and for various heliostat zenith angle configurations .",
    "the pmt single counting rates were estimated from scaler counters that monitored each pmt .",
    "the three and four - fold coincidence rates were calculated from additional scaler counters or from the tdc information .",
    "the two methods used to estimate the coincidence rates gave identical results .",
    "in addition , the distributions of the time intervals between successive events predicted coincidence rates that were consistent with the measured rates .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : times ] shows the time interval distribution of successive events for data taken on november 4 .",
    "the shape of the distribution for small time differences indicates that the detector deadtime was small ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : pmtrates ] shows typical pmt single counting rates and three and four - fold coincidence rates for the detector under various operating conditions .",
    "the coincidence rates demonstrate that the detector was triggering on atmospheric cherenkov radiation since coincidences only occurred when the heliostats were aligned to a common point in the sky .",
    "the fact that the coincidence window was short ( @xmath26nsec ) excluded the possibility that artificial light sources caused accidental coincidences .",
    "the pulses of individual pmt signals in coincidence events were examined on a storage oscilloscope , and were found to have very sharp rise - times ( @xmath35nsec ) and profiles consistent with cherenkov radiation produced in the atmosphere .",
    ".typical pmt single counting rates and trigger coincidence values ( in 10 minute intervals ) for various detector configurations at a pmt threshold of 125mv .",

    "the range in the single counting rates reflects gain differences among the pmts .",
    "the difference in the single counting rates between configurations b and c reflects the fact that the heliostats were pointed to different sky locations in these two configurations . for configurations c and d",
    ", the heliostats were aligned to detect vertical air showers .",

    "this flux represents the number of particles hitting the upper atmosphere of the earth per unit time per unit solid angle .",
    "our experiment , however , triggers on the air shower produced from the cosmic ray interaction .",
    "we must therefore account for the variation in shower size for different cosmic ray nuclei .",
    "heavy nuclei interact sooner in the atmosphere and deposit a larger fraction of their energy into the hadronic cascade than do light nuclei .",
    "these effects lead to a significant decrease in the cherenkov light yield for air showers produced by nuclei of increasing mass .",

    "<S> there is considerable interest world - wide in developing large area atmospheric cherenkov detectors for ground - based gamma - ray astronomy . </S>",
    "<S> this interest stems , in large part , from the fact that the gamma - ray energy region between 20 and 250 gev is unexplored by any experiment . </S>",
    "<S> atmospheric cherenkov detectors offer a possible way to explore this region , but large photon collection areas are needed to achieve low energy thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> we are developing an experiment using the heliostat mirrors of a solar power plant as the primary collecting element . </S>",
    "<S> as part of this development , we built a detector using four heliostat mirrors , a secondary fresnel lens , and a fast photon detection system . in november 1994 </S>",
    "<S> , we used this detector to record atmospheric cherenkov radiation produced by cosmic ray particles showering in the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the detected rate of cosmic ray events was consistent with an energy threshold near 1 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the data presented here represent the first detection of atmospheric cherenkov radiation using solar heliostats viewed from a central tower . </S>"
