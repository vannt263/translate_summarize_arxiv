    "the intimate connection between the impossibility of making a perfect quantum cloning machine ( qcm ) and the no - signaling condition , which prevents any superluminal communication , has been realized since the seminal papers of dieks@xcite and of wootters and zurek@xcite .",
    "more recently , gisin has shown that this connection can actually be exploited in order to recover the fidelity 5/6 of the buzek - hillery universal qcm for qubits@xcite . any cloning machine which would duplicate a qubit with a fidelity exceeding 5/6",
    "would necessarily open a way to superluminal communication . in short , the no - signaling condition is taken into account by expressing that two statistical ensembles realizing the same input density matrix ( e.g. an equal mixture of @xmath1 and @xmath2 or an equal mixture of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) must result in indistinguishable output density matrices for the clones . since then",
    ", this no - signaling constraint has also been used to recover the fidelity of other classes of cloners , namely the asymmetric universal and phase - covariant qubit cloners@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we exploit this no - signaling condition in order to derive an upper bound on the fidelity of a new class of qcms , which have not been considered in the literature .",
    "we analyze symmetric qcms which duplicate any @xmath0-dimensional _ real _ state with an equal fidelity .",
    "these are the counterpart of the well - known universal qcms but within the realm of the so - called `` real '' quantum mechanics .",
    "we also find a constructive method to build qcms that saturate this upper bound , and therefore are optimal .",
    "in particular , using this method for @xmath5 , we find a cloner unitarily equivalent to the phase - covariant qubit cloner@xcite which clones all states @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 being real and satisfying @xmath9 ) with a fidelity @xmath10 . for an arbitrary dimension @xmath0 , we use techniques from tensor calculus in order to derive the no - signaling bound and the explicit cloner .",
    "a specific application of this notion of real qcms arises in four dimensions , when these cloners are equivalent , up to a unitary transformation , to the universal cloners over the set of maximally entangled qubit pairs@xcite .    in general , the no - signaling requirement",
    "does not provide a tight upper bound on the optimal cloning fidelity .",
    "the linearity and trace preserving properties ( which , combined , imply the no signaling condition ) need to be supplemented with the complete positivity property in order to determine the best possible cloning transformation@xcite .",
    "however , for the real qcms of interest , it is sufficient to combine the no - signaling requirement together with positivity ( and trace preservation ) in order to find a tight bound , just as in gisin s original paper@xcite .",
    "the impossibility of signaling is crucial to derive this bound : would signaling be possible , an hypothetical perfect qcm providing two exact clones would then become permitted .",
    "furthermore , we show that a similar reasoning can also be applied in order to find the optimal fidelity of the universal qcm in @xmath0 dimensions@xcite . thus , the requirement of no - signaling allows us to recover more simply and straightforwardly some standard results on cloning .",
    "a reason for which the no - signaling upper bound on the fidelity is saturated is that the set of states we are cloning is somehow `` large '' .",
    "the set of @xmath0-dimensional real states is realized by means of the @xmath11 group representation , while the whole set of @xmath0-dimensional complex states is realized by means of the usual @xmath12 representation @xcite .",
    "if we impose that the qcm acts equally on all the input states defined by one of these representations , then the number of arbitrary independent parameters characterizing the cloning transformation is considerably reduced . for the real qcm",
    ", we will show that the density matrix can be reexpressed under the form of a covariant real tensor .",
    "this simplification allows us to diagonalize the resulting density matrix and easily express no - signaling and positivity .",
    "then , the initial optimization problem is turned into a simpler one involving only seven independent parameters , which can be solved analytically .",
    "the real input state to be cloned is defined in the computational basis @xmath13 as @xmath14 where the amplitudes @xmath15 are real and normalized as @xmath16 .",
    "the two - clone output density matrix corresponding to this input state @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is an arbitrary real rotation in the @xmath0-dimensional space satisfying @xmath22 ( the summation symbol will be omitted from now on when dealing with tensors ) .",
    "this covariance property implies that @xmath23 is a tensor of rank four , i.e. , it satisfies @xmath24 since we seek a symmetric cloner , the output density matrix must be invariant under the interchange of the two clones , i.e. under the permutations @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the covariance and the permutation symmetry of the tensor impose the following general form @xcite : @xmath27 where the @xmath28 are seven independent real parameters .",
    "note that if @xmath29 and all other parameters vanish , the two clones are perfect .",
    "the main result below is that the no - signaling condition imposes that @xmath30 , so perfect cloning is precluded .",
    "it is convenient , in what follows , to diagonalize this tensor , eq .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) , and use its eigenvalues ( along with a few other coefficients ) as independent parameters that characterize the tensor .",
    "the optimization will then be made over these parameters .",
    "the diagonalization of eq .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) results in @xmath31 where the complete set of orthonormal eigenvectors are defined in table i.    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that all the eigenvectors are normalized to unity except for the off - diagonal eigenvectors of the symmetric subset @xmath32 which are normalized to 1/2 , i.e. , @xmath33 . here , the coefficients @xmath34 denote an arbitrary set of basis vectors ( @xmath35 ) of the subspace orthogonal to @xmath36 .",
    "the notation @xmath37 stands for the unit antisymmetric tensor of rank @xmath38 , which is equal to @xmath39 if @xmath40 is an even permutation of @xmath41 , to @xmath42 if @xmath40 is an odd permutation of @xmath41 , and to @xmath43 if any index is repeated .",
    "the permutation symmetry between the two clones imposes that @xmath44 , so that either @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "this constraint reduces to seven the number of independent parameters among the eight parameters @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "a straightforward identification between expressions ( [ tensor ] ) and ( [ diag ] ) allows us to unambiguously express the seven independent parameters @xmath28 in terms of the new ones .",
    "let us now consider the density matrix of each of the two clones and their fidelity with respect to the input state .",
    "the two clones are in the same mixture due to permutation symmetry , and the covariance imposes that the density matrix is given by a rank - two tensor of the form @xmath52",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & = & f |\\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi |+ \\frac{1-f}{d-1}\\left(\\openone-|\\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi |\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the fidelity @xmath54 using eq .",
    "( [ diag ] ) , we can express the fidelity in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvector parameters , @xmath55 when maximizing @xmath53",
    ", we will have to take into account the three following constraints :    _ i ) positivity : _ @xmath56 + this gives @xmath57 with @xmath48 .    _ ii ) trace preservation _ :",
    "@xmath58 + @xmath59    _ iii ) no - signaling condition _ : + this requires that the uniform mixture of any two basis sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( which thus both realize the same input density matrix , namely the identity ) must result in two indistinguishable output density matrices .",
    "thus , @xmath62 using eq .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) and the completion relation @xmath63 , the only way of satisfying eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) is to forbid quartic term in ( [ tensor ] ) , i.e. to impose @xmath30 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this means that the `` perfect cloning '' term in eq .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) is forbidden .",
    "if this no - signaling condition is not obeyed , then by maximizing @xmath53 we obtain a perfect cloner described in terms of the only eigenvector @xmath64 setting @xmath65 .",
    "thus , according to intuition , we observe that this no - signaling condition is needed in order to exclude perfect cloning . in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvector parameters ,",
    "this no - signaling condition becomes @xmath66 where we have defined the positive coefficients @xmath67 @xmath68    now , the constrained optimization problem can be solved analytically in order to upper bound the cloning fidelity .",
    "first , we observe that when @xmath69 , we can always increase the fidelity by substituting @xmath47 ( @xmath70 ) with @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath43 .",
    "this substitution increases the fidelity while keeping the constraints satisfied .",
    "therefore , the requirement @xmath73 always gives an optimal fidelity .",
    "second , remember that the permutation symmetry imposes either ( a ) @xmath46 or ( b ) @xmath45 .",
    "we will consider these two possibilities .",
    "_ case ( a ) .",
    "_ let us examine first the case @xmath74 .",
    "we eliminate the variable @xmath75 between eqs.([ut ] ) and ( [ nsc ] ) , resulting in @xmath76 similarly , combining eqs .",
    "( [ f ] ) and ( [ nsc ] ) gives @xmath77 the coefficients in front of the eigenvalues @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are all semi - positive in eqs.([ut2 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) , so that only one of these eigenvalues is non - zero in the optimum .",
    "for each non - zero eigenvalue , eqs.([ut2 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) give a value for the fidelity , and the maximum fidelity is simply chosen as the best of these three possibilities .",
    "we find that the fidelity is upper bounded by @xmath81 the first term in the maximum , eq.([f4 ] ) , must be greater than @xmath82 to be of interest",
    ". this condition is fulfilled only if @xmath83 and this can be the case only when @xmath5 .",
    "but , for @xmath5 , we notice that the first term is maximized by choosing @xmath84 , since the optimum always lies within the range @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , if we substitute @xmath86 with @xmath87 , we recover the second term of ( [ f4 ] ) .",
    "thus , optimizing the first term for @xmath5 amounts to optimizing the second term . as a consequence ,",
    "we are left with maximizing the second term of ( [ f4 ] ) for any dimension , which only depends on @xmath88 .",
    "the maximum is found for @xmath89 consequently , the cloning fidelity of the real qcm in @xmath0 dimensions can not exceed the following upper bound @xmath90 in order to make signaling via cloning impossible .",
    "this is the main result of this section .",
    "_ case ( b ) .",
    "_ in order to be complete , let us consider the second case @xmath91 and show that the upper bound can not be improved . similarly",
    "to the first case , we eliminate the variable @xmath75 from eqs.([ut ] ) and ( [ nsc ] ) , and obtain equations similar to eqs .",
    "( [ ut2 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) , namely @xmath92 and @xmath93 we then obtain an upper bound on @xmath53 given by @xmath94 from ( [ f6 ] ) , we note that for the fidelity to be greater than @xmath82 , then either @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "but if one of these conditions is satisfied , then each term in eq .  ( [ f6 ] ) is lower than the corresponding one in eq .",
    "( [ f4 ] ) . therefore ,",
    "we conclude that the no - signaling upper bound is indeed given by ( [ ffinal ] ) .",
    "we will now explicitly construct a real qcm and observe that it saturates the no - signaling upper bound eq .",
    "( [ ffinal ] ) . hence",
    ", we will have found an optimal real qcm in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we will follow here the constructive method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which consists in considering the cloning of an input system that is maximally entangled with a reference system denoted as @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 . in this case",
    ", the joint state @xmath99 of the reference , the two output clones , and the ancilla completely characterizes the cloning transformation .",
    "( the reference and ancilla systems are assumed to belong to a space of dimension @xmath0 , just as the input and the two clones . )",
    "we consider here the most general state @xmath100 where the indexes 1 , 2 , @xmath97 and @xmath101 refer respectively to the two clones , the reference , and the ancilla .",
    "note that this state does not depend on @xmath36 , but it can be easily used in order to define the cloning transformation applied on state @xmath102 : projecting the reference system of @xmath103 onto @xmath102 , but this is irrelevant here since we deal with real qcms . ] amounts to defining the cloning transformation as : @xmath104 we require that this state obeys the following covariance principle @xmath105 for all real unitary rotations @xmath106 as those used in eq .",
    "( [ cov ] ) .",
    "this strong requirement allows to recover the property ( [ cov ] ) , while the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "the condition ( [ ct ] ) physically means that applying a rotation @xmath106 on the input ( or rotating the reference by @xmath107 ) is equivalent to rotating the two clones by @xmath106 and the ancilla by @xmath107 .",
    "this covariance principle implies that @xmath108 is a tensor of rank four , that is , it satisfies @xmath109 the most general tensor obeying eq .",
    "( [ u4 ] ) can be written as @xcite : @xmath110 the symmetry permutation between the two clones imposes that @xmath111 .",
    "the fidelity @xmath53 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ ct ] ) by tracing over one of the clones and the ancilla , resulting in @xmath112 this expression has to be maximized under the normalization constraint @xmath113 it can be checked that this maximization procedure exactly gives the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ffinal ] ) , so that the cloner we have constructed saturates the no - signaling bound .",
    "the corresponding optimal coefficients are given by @xmath114^{1/2 } \\\\",
    "c&=&\\frac{\\sqrt{d^2 + 4d + 20}-d-2}{4}a\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "consider now a universal cloner , that is a qcm such that any pure state @xmath115 ( with @xmath116 being complex amplitudes ) is cloned with the same fidelity . to obey the covariance properties ( [ cov ] ) for _ any _ unitary transformation @xmath106 , the output density matrix must have the more restricted form : @xmath117 in comparison with ( [ tensor ] ) , the covariance condition imposes that @xmath118 and , consequently , that @xmath65 . as a result , the second term in ( [ f4 ] ) gives a smaller upper bound so that we find @xmath119 the universal @xmath0-dimensional cloner saturating this bound has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , so we see that the no - signaling condition again gives a tight bound .",
    "we can recover this cloner by following section iii .",
    "the covariance condition implies that @xmath120 and , as a consequence , @xmath121 .",
    "we have found a new class of qcms which duplicate any @xmath0-dimensional real state with an equal fidelity @xmath122 furthermore , for these universal cloners over real states in @xmath0 dimensions , we have demonstrated that the no - signaling requirement provides a sufficient constraint to unambiguously determine the optimal performance of the cloners . without this no - signaling constraint ,",
    "we would obtain a perfect cloner forbidden by quantum theory .",
    "hence , we have found the optimal real qcms .    in the special case of @xmath5",
    ", we recover the phase - covariant qubit cloner of fidelity @xmath123 as derived in @xcite ( see also the appendix of @xcite ) . for qutrits ( @xmath124 )",
    ", we get a cloner of fidelity @xmath125 this result is distinct from the fidelity of the three known qcms for qutrits@xcite : @xmath126 for the universal qutrit cloner , @xmath127 for the two - phase covariant qutrit cloner , and @xmath128 for the qutrit cloner of two mutually unbiased bases .",
    "this suggests that these real qcms form a genuinely new class of qcms .",
    "note , finally , that when the dimension @xmath0 tends to infinity , the cloning fidelity @xmath53 tends to @xmath129 . in fig . 1 , we have plotted , for comparison , the fidelity as a function of the dimension @xmath0 for the universal cloner , the real cloner derived here , and the optimal cloner of two mutually unbiased bases obtained in ref .  @xcite . as expected , we observe that the real qcm has a higher fidelity than the universal qcm since it clones the restricted class of real states . however , the real qcm performs less well than the cloner of two mutually unbiased bases ( except when @xmath5 where they coincide ) .",
    "an interesting issue of this work is the potential generalization of this method exploiting the no - signaling constraint to any kind of cloners .",
    "it is likely , however , that for a more restrictive set of states to be cloned equally , the no - signaling constraint may only give a non - tight upper bound for the fidelity .",
    "a typical example may be cloning the set of only two mutually unbiased bases : this smaller set might impose a weaker covariance constraint to the cloning transformation , so the maximum fidelity consistent with no - signaling might correspond to a cloner that is not allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "this will be further investigated .",
