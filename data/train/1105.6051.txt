    "motion of a thin vortex filament in an incompressible inviscid fluid in an infinite three - dimensional domain within the localized induction approximation ( lia ) is governed by the simple equation for the induced velocity @xmath0 @xmath1 which implies the following intrinsic equations for the curvature @xmath2 and torsion @xmath3 @xmath4 here @xmath5 is a position vector for a point on the curve representing the filament , @xmath6 is time , @xmath7 is the arclenght parameter , subscripts indicate the differentiation with respect to the indicated variables , and @xmath8 is the binormal .",
    "equations ( [ lia - x ] ) and ( [ lia - eqn ] ) have been derived by l. s. da rios in 1906 @xcite and have been rediscovered sixty years later in @xcite .",
    "the detailed history of da rios ( dr ) system is presented in @xcite for the localized induction approximation see e.g. @xcite .    in 1972",
    "hasimoto has observed @xcite that equation ( [ lia - x ] ) is equivalent to the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xmath9 via the transformation @xmath10 only one year before zakharov and shabat @xcite discovered that nls equation ( [ nls ] ) is integrable by the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) method .",
    "hasimoto s result has demonstrated that the whole powerful machinery of the ist method ( solitons , infinite sets of integrals of motion , symmetries , etc . )",
    "is applicable to the vortex filament dynamics and has lead to the explosion of interest to the vortex filament dynamics .",
    "since that time various aspects of this dynamics have been analysed by different methods ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "stability of vortex filament motion and formation of singularities are two important problems partially addressed during this period ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "modulation instability of the focusing nls equation ( [ nls ] ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) definitely is a key element in such an analysis .",
    "recently it was shown that the dispersionless limit of the nls equation ( [ nls ] ) is quite relevant to the study of the modulation instability @xcite@xcite . in this limit",
    "the focusing nls equation is the elliptic system of quasilinear pdes .",
    "the cauchy problem is ill - posed for this system and solutions exhibit the gradient catastrophe type behavior at finite time .",
    "behavior of solutions of the dispersionless nls equation near the point of gradient catastrophe and beyond it has been studied in @xcite too .    in the present paper",
    "we study the geometrical and analytical implications of such an analysis for the vortex filament dynamics . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to deal with da rios system ( [ lia - eqn ] ) directly .",
    "we first consider a dispersionless ( ddr ) system which describes motion of vortex filament with curvature and torsion slowly varying along the filament and in the motion .",
    "it is the system of quasilinear equations of elliptic type which in terms of the complex - valued riemann invariant @xmath11 and slow variables @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is of the form @xmath15 this system well approximates dr system ( [ lia - eqn ] ) until the derivatives @xmath16 , @xmath17 are not large .",
    "hodograph equations for equation ( [ betay ] ) describe critical points of the function @xmath18 which obey the euler - poisson - darboux equation @xmath19 .",
    "gradient catastrophe for the ddr system happens in a point @xmath20 for given initial data . at this point @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( or @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 )",
    "the acceleration @xmath25 explodes too .",
    "so the filament becomes fast oscillating near the point @xmath26 at the `` time '' @xmath27 .",
    "numerical analysis ( borrowed from @xcite ) shows that such oscillations begin to expand along the filament .",
    "intrinsically , the filament begins to oscillate around the rectifying plane near the point @xmath26 .",
    "so , the gradient catastrophe for the system ( [ betay ] ) gives rise to fast oscillation which can be referred as filament flutter by analogy with airfoil flutter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of behavior near the point @xmath28 of gradient catastrophe shows that @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath14 , and @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are some constants .",
    "thus the function @xmath18 exhibits an elliptic umbilic singularity behavior in the terminology of thom @xcite .",
    "regularization of this singularity is one of the issues of this paper .    at the point of gradient catastrophe",
    "the approximation ( [ betay ] ) becomes invalid and should be substituted by the full dr system ( [ lia - eqn ] ) .",
    "first order corrections can be obtained by the double - scaling technique together with appropriate modification of the function @xmath36 to a functional @xmath37 such that the equations of critical points for @xmath18 are substituted by the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting equation for small corrections is equivalent to the painlev - i ( p - i ) equation @xmath38 the result of the paper @xcite allows us to conjecture that any generic solution of the gradient catastrophe behaves as @xmath29 where the correction @xmath39 is described by the tritronque solution of the p - i equation .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "dispersionless dr system , its different forms , hodograph equation and other its properties are discussed in section 2 .",

    "it is shown that near to the singular point filament exhibits the elliptic umbilic catastrophe behavior .",
    "regularization of this singularity via the painlev - i equation is presented in section 6 .",
    "in order to describe dispersionless ( or quasiclassical ) limit of dr system one , in a standard manner , introduces slow variables @xmath12 , @xmath13 with @xmath14 and assume that curvature and torsion are smooth functions of slow variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 . under these assumptions equation ( [ lia - eqn ] )",
    "take the form @xmath42 thus in the limit @xmath43 one has the ddr system @xmath44 analogously to the dispersionless nls equation @xcite@xcite the solutions of the ddr system ( [ dlia - eqn ] ) well approximate solutions of the dr system in points were @xmath21 and @xmath23 are finite . as any two - component system it is linearizable by hodograph transformation @xmath45 .",
    "the characteristic velocities for ddr system are complex @xmath46 , riemann invariant @xmath47 and in terms of @xmath48 the ddr system is of the form ( [ dlia - eqn ] ) .",
    "we note that solutions of the dnls system discussed in @xcite and those of ddr system ( [ dlia - eqn ] ) are connected by the simple relations @xmath49 , @xmath50 . for the geometrical consideration the system ( [ dlia - eqn ] )",
    "is more convenient .",
    "the ddr system is known to be integrable similar to its hyperbolic version , i.e. the 1-layer benney system @xcite .",
    "it has an infinite set of symmetries and integrals of motion .",
    "one of the form of the ddr hierarchy is given by the set of equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a formal laurent series defined by the equations @xmath53 @xmath54 are time variables and @xmath55 denotes the polynomial part of @xmath34 . the ddr system ( [ dlia - eqn ] ) is the first flow of the hierarchy ( [ dlia - hie ] ) at @xmath56 .",
    "all @xmath57 are densities of integrals of motion for the ddr system .",
    "they are the dispersionless limit of the densities of integrals of motion for the full dr system ( [ lia - eqn ] ) found in @xcite .",
    "solutions of the ddr system can be calculated via the standard hodograph equation .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that these hodograph equations are , in fact , the equations @xmath58 which define the critical points of the function of the form @xmath59 where the function @xmath60 is defined by the initial data for @xmath48 and it is such that @xmath18 obeys the euler - poisson - darboux equation @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath61 since the function @xmath18 is real valued , the second equation of ( [ eul - lag ] ) is the complex conjugated to the first one .",
    "hodograph equation is @xmath62 in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 the function @xmath18 is @xmath63 the hodograph equations ( [ hodow ] ) are given by @xmath64 while the euler - poisson - darboux equation is of the form @xmath65 it is the axisymmetric three - dimensional laplace equation studied by beltrami @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 play the role of the radial and axial coordinate respectively in the cylindrical system of coordinates .    for the ddr hierarchy ( [ dlia - hie ] )",
    "the function @xmath18 has the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes a small circle around infinity .",
    "euler - poisson - darboux equations ( [ epde ] ) is quite useful in the study of singular sector of the 1-layer benney and ddr hierarchies @xcite",
    "hodograph equations ( [ eul - lag ] ) provide us with unique solution of the ddr system if the standard condition @xmath68 is satisfied . due to the euler - poisson - darboux equations ( [ epde ] ) on the solutions of the ddr system with @xmath69 the function @xmath18 obeys the equation @xmath70 . hence @xmath71 and ,",
    "consequently , the hodograph equations ( [ hodow ] ) are uniquely solvable if @xmath72 .",
    "in this situation the derivatives @xmath16 and @xmath73 are bounded together with @xmath48 . indeed , differentiating equation ( [ hodow ] ) with respect to @xmath74 , one gets the system @xmath75 so for the solutions of the ddr system one has @xmath76 thus regular sector of the ddr system ( [ dlia - eqn ] ) is characterized by the condition @xcite @xmath77 in this sector @xmath48 and the derivatives @xmath16 , @xmath17 , i.e. curvature @xmath2 , torsion @xmath3 , and their derivatives are bounded .",
    "singular sector of ddr system is composed by solutions for which @xmath78 . for these solutions @xmath48 ( i.e. curvature and torsion ) remain bounded while their derivatives explode .",
    "such situation is usually referred as gradient catastrophe ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "generic gradient catastrophe is characterized by the conditions @xcite @xmath79 at @xmath69 ( @xmath80 ) one also has @xmath70 and the conditions ( [ catcon - b ] ) , in terms of curvature and torsion are @xmath81 equations @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , are consequences of ( [ catcon - kt ] ) .",
    "last conditions ( [ catcon - kt ] ) allow us to solve the conditions @xmath85 with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 . substituting these expressions into the first two conditions ( [ catcon - kt ] ) ,",
    "one gets two equations @xmath86 thus generic gradient catastrophe for the ddr system happens in a single point @xmath20 for given @xmath87 , i.e. initial data for @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . for the focusing dnls equation",
    "this fact has been first noted in @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in contrast to the hyperbolic case where the catastrophe locus is a curve in @xmath88 here the catastrophe happens in a point .",
    "gradient catastrophe for the ddr system means a special behavior of a filament at the point @xmath26 at time @xmath27 .",
    "first one observes , using formula ( 20 ) in @xcite with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , that the acceleration @xmath91 for the velocity ( [ lia - x ] ) @xmath92\\ ] ] explodes at @xmath26 .",
    "thus , at the moment @xmath93 sharp bump is formed at the point @xmath94 of the filament .",
    "local consideration reveals another peculiarity of behavior of filament around the point @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known , that the coordinates of a curve in a neighborhood of a point in the reference system formed by the tangent vector @xmath95 , normal @xmath96 , and binormal @xmath8 and origin in the point ( see e.g. formula ( 6.7 ) @xcite ) are @xmath97 passing to the slow variable @xmath74 and slow coordinates",
    "@xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , one gets the same series ( [ xxx ] ) for slow variables with substitution @xmath101 . at ordinary point",
    "where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath21 , @xmath23 are bounded the first terms in r.h.s . of ( [ xxx ] )",
    "dominate and the curve , locally , is a twisted cubic .",
    "its projection on the osculating plane ( spanned by @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) , normal plane ( spanned by @xmath8 and @xmath96 ) and rectifying plane ( spanned by @xmath95 and @xmath8 ) are parabola ( @xmath102 ) , cusp ( @xmath103 ) and cubic ( @xmath104 ) respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig - pcc ] , see e.g. @xcite ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     characteristic feature of a curve ( and a filament ) in an ordinary point ( i.e. , outside the points of gradient catastrophe ) is that it lies always on one side of positive direction of the normal and on one side of osculating plane ( depending on sign of torsion @xmath3 ) .    at the point @xmath26 of gradient catastrophe ,",
    "the behaviors of a curve changes drastically .",
    "indeed , when @xmath21 and @xmath23 become large , the second terms in @xmath105 and @xmath106 become relevant .",
    "so , parabola in the osculating plane may change sign or even convert into cubic curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig - clc ] ) while in the normal plane it could be a plane @xmath107 curve and so on .",
    "so , around the point @xmath26 of gradient catastrophe a filament oscillates from one side of the rectifying planes to another and back .",
    "such oscillation is quite similar to that of airfoil ( see e.g. @xcite ) and one can refer to these oscillation of a filament in the point of gradient catastrophe as a flutter .    at each point of a curve",
    "there is a sphere which has contact of a third order at this point .",
    "it is called the osculating sphere ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has radius @xmath108 and its center has coordinates @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the position vector of a point on the curve .",
    "at the point of gradient catastrophe the radius of the osculating sphere and its center blow up to infinity .",
    "oscillation of a curve around the rectifying plane and blow up of the osculating sphere are geometrical features of the gradient catastrophe and flutter of a filament . at the point @xmath111 of gradient catastrophe derivatives @xmath112 are so large that the terms of higher order derivatives in the dr equation ( [ lia - eqn - e ] ) become relevant for finite @xmath113 .",
    "solutions of the full dr system ( [ lia - eqn - e ] ) at small @xmath113 are almost indistinguishable from those of the ddr system at @xmath114 ( for dnls equation see @xcite@xcite ) . at @xmath115 the behavior of solutions of ddr and dr system are completely different .",
    "solutions of the dr system at @xmath115 develop a zone of rapid oscillations which expand around the point @xmath26 .",
    "for the equivalent dnls equation this fact has been observed both analytically and numerically ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "an example of such a behaviors is given by the figure 13 of paper @xcite . in the terms of @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 the initial data from @xcite are @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "gradient catastrophe happens in @xmath118 and @xmath119 . at this point",
    "the corresponding solution of dr system becomes oscillate . as time",
    "@xmath120 growth a zone of rapid oscillations expands as @xmath121 symmetrically around the point @xmath26 . for the filament dynamics",
    "this effect is seen as the creation of rapid oscillations at the point of gradient catastrophe and their subsequent expansion along the growing in time piece of filament ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .",
    "such a behavior is an evidence of the flutter type instability of the vortex filament motion .",
    "in order to understand better this phenomenon one should analyse in more detail the structure of the singularity and the regularizing mechanism for the gradient catastrophe . for the focusing dnls equation",
    "such an analysis based on the @xmath113-expansion of the integrals of motions of the nls / toda equation has been performed in @xcite . here",
    "we will follow a different approach discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "thus we consider a neighborhood of the gradient catastrophe point @xmath28 and denote the values of @xmath48 at this point by @xmath122 .",
    "following to the double scaling limit method ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) we will look for solutions of the dr system near the point of gradient catastrophe of the form @xmath123 where @xmath14 and numbers @xmath124 should be fixed by further consideration . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath125 .",
    "we first consider the function @xmath36 ( [ w ] ) .",
    "one has @xmath126 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\epsilon^{\\alpha+\\gamma}x^ * ( { \\beta^ * + 3\\overline{\\beta}^ * } ) \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\epsilon^{2\\gamma } \\left [   \\left(\\frac{3}{4}y_0+\\widetilde{w}^0_{\\beta \\beta}\\right ) { \\beta^*}^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}y_0+\\widetilde{w}^0_{\\overline{\\beta}\\overline{\\beta } }   \\right ) { \\overline{\\beta}^*}^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}+2\\widetilde{w}^0_{{\\beta}\\overline{\\beta } }   \\right){\\overline{\\beta}^*}\\beta^ * \\right ] \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{6 } \\epsilon^{3\\gamma } \\left [ \\widetilde{w}^0_{\\beta\\beta\\beta } { \\beta^*}^3 + 2\\widetilde{w}^0_{\\beta\\beta \\overline{\\beta } } { \\beta^*}^2{\\overline{\\beta}^*}+ 2\\widetilde{w}^0_{\\beta \\overline{\\beta } \\overline{\\beta } } { \\beta^*}{\\overline{\\beta}^*}^2 + \\widetilde{w}^0_{\\overline{\\beta}\\overline{\\beta}\\overline{\\beta } } { \\overline{\\beta}^*}^3 \\right]+\\dots \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and so on .    hodograph equation",
    "( [ hodow ] ) and conditions ( [ catcon - b ] ) imply that @xmath130 at curvature @xmath69 the euler - poisson - darboux equations ( [ epde ] ) and its differential consequences @xmath131 imply that @xmath132 i.e. @xmath133 taking into account equations ( [ consq - hodo ] ) and ( [ w - cond - crit ] ) , one finally gets @xmath134 where @xmath135 . consequently near the point",
    "@xmath28 the hodograph equations take the form @xmath136 these equations readily imply that @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "so , near to the point @xmath26 @xmath139 thus near to the point of gradient catastrophe the function @xmath18 is of the form @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath11 .",
    "denoting @xmath142 , one gets @xmath143 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are certain constants . in the thom s catastrophe theory",
    "a function of this form is known as describing elliptic umbilic singularity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "so gradient catastrophe and flutter for vortex filament motion enter into the general scheme of catastrophe theory . for the focusing nls equation",
    "the appearance of elliptic umbilic singularity has been observed for the first time in @xcite .",
    "next step is to regularize this singularity . within the double scaling limit method adopted also in @xcite",
    "one begins with the full dispersive system . performing appropriate double scaling limit one",
    "calculate the required regularizing terms .",
    "an approach discussed in @xcite suggests to proceed in opposite direction , namely , to begin with the original ( say dispersionless system ) , to modify the corresponding function @xmath18 adding to it the differential terms of lowest order with appropriate scaling and then to require that the critical point equations ( [ eul - lag ] ) for @xmath18 are substituted by the euler lagrange equations for the modified @xmath144 , i.e. @xmath145 following this approach we first observe that the contributions of @xmath39 and @xmath146 into the perturbation @xmath37 of @xmath18 are separated .",
    "it is quite natural to modify the function ( [ wexp ] ) in such a way that this separation and reality property @xmath147 are preserved .",
    "thus , omitting inessential second term in ( [ w - x0y0 ] ) , and choosing without lost of generality @xmath148 , one has the following modified @xmath18 @xmath149 + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon^\\delta   \\left [ b { \\beta_{x^*}^*}^2 + \\overline{b}\\ , { \\overline{\\beta}_{x^*}^*}^2 \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are appropriate constants .",
    "the corresponding euler - lagrange equation for @xmath39 and @xmath146 is @xmath152 i.e. @xmath153 -\\epsilon^\\delta   \\left [ b { \\beta_{x^ * x^*}^ * } \\right]=0.\\ ] ] to balance the first term one should choose @xmath154 .",
    "thus , the modified @xmath144 is of the form @xmath155\\ ] ] and the corresponding equation for @xmath39 is @xmath156 this equation is converted into the classical painlev - i equation ( [ p - i ] ) by simple change of variables @xmath157 with @xmath158 .",
    "so , the regularized behavior at the point of the gradient catastrophe of dr system , i.e. for the vortex filament dynamics is governed by the painlev - i equation .",
    "the relevance of this equation for the nls / toda system near to the critical point has been observed in a different way in @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between the solution of equation ( [ p - iour ] ) and those given by the formula ( 5.21 ) in @xcite is ( at @xmath159 ) @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 are defined in ( 2.19 ) and ( 2.22 ) of @xcite .",
    "one concludes also that @xmath165 . in the paper ( @xcite )",
    "it was conjectured that any generic solution of he nls equation near to the critical point is described by the tritronque solution of the painlev - i equation .",
    "extension of this observation to our case allows to formulate the        properties of the solution ( [ b - conj ] ) as well as other features of flutter for vortex filaments will be discussed elsewhere .",
