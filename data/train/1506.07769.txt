    "rapid x - ray variability is one of the basic observational characteristics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "it is a useful tool to study black holes ( bh ) and the central engine of agn , since the x - ray emission is thought to originate from the innermost region of an accretion flow around the bh .",
    "one commonly used method to characterize the variability is the power spectrum density ( psd ) analysis , which quantifies the amount of variability power as a function of temporal frequency @xcite .",
    "the psd of agn has been found to be well described by a broken power - law ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the break frequency is found to be inversely scaled with the black hole mass in a linear way , with a possible dependence on the scaled accretion rate @xmath5 ( in units of the eddington accretion rate ) @xcite .",
    "these results are remarkable in the sense that agn show similar x - ray variability properties to black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxb ) , indicating that agn are scaled - up versions of bhxb ( see also @xcite ) .    however , reliable psd analyses require well sampled , high quality x - ray data of time series , which are generally hard to obtain for large samples of agn for the current x - ray observatories .",
    "instead , an easier - to - calculate quantity , the `` normalized excess variance '' @xmath0 ( e.g. @xcite ) , is commonly used to quantify the x - ray variability amplitude . early studies revealed correlations between the excess variance and various parameters of agn , such as x - ray luminosity , spectral index , and the fwhm of the h@xmath6 line ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "later work suggested that these correlations are in fact by - products of a more fundamental relation with black hole mass : the @xmath4 relation @xcite .",
    "in fact , this relation conforms to the scaling relation for the psd break frequency with bh mass @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed the anti - correlation between the excess variance and @xmath7 with a large agn sample observed with asca .",
    "@xcite obtained a tight correlation , using high quality _ xmm - newton _ light curves of agn whose black hole masses were measured with the reverberation mapping technique .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of the relationship ( @xmath8 dex ) is comparable to that of the relation between @xmath7 and stellar velocity dispersion for galactic bulge @xcite . by making use of a large sample of 161 agn observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ for at least 10ks for each object , @xcite ( henceforth p12 ) reaffirmed this relationship ( using the excess variance calculated on various timescales of 10ks , 20ks , 40ks and 80ks ) , but found only a weak dependence on the accretion rate .",
    "the significant correlation with small scatters ( 0.4 dex for the reverberation mapping sample , 0.7 dex for the caixavar sample , see @xcite for details ) suggested that it may provide similarly or even more accurate black hole mass estimation compared to the method based on the single epoch optical spectra @xcite .",
    "moreover , unlike the commonly used virial method that is susceptible to the orientation effect of agn @xcite , x - ray variability can be considered as inclination - independent .    however , the previous studies were based on agn samples with mostly supermassive black hole of @xmath9 , and little is known about the relation for agn with @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath0 of a few agn with @xmath11 were presented and found to have the largest @xmath0 values among agn over a large @xmath7 range @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the @xmath4 relation may show a deviation from the linear relation in the low - mass regime ; however , the data is too sparse to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "thus , the question remains unanswered as to whether this relation can be extended to @xmath12 .",
    "the answer to this question is important in at least two aspects .",
    "first , if the answer is `` yes '' , the relation would provide a valuable method to find the so - called low - mass agn with @xmath13 , or sometimes referred to as agn with intermediate - mass black holes ( imbh ) .",
    "this is of particular interest since in these agn the commonly used virial method involving optical broad emission lines becomes difficult in practice due to the faint agn ( broad line ) luminosities that are outshined by the host galaxy starlight .",
    "in fact , there has been a few attempts in practice by adopting such an assumption . by extrapolating the @xmath4 relation to below @xmath14",
    ", @xcite selected a sample of 15 candidate low - mass agn using the x - ray excess variance .",
    "second , the @xmath4 relation must have a cutoff somewhere , otherwise the variability would have become unrealistically large for ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulx ) and bhxb , which is not seen in observations , however ( e.g. @xcite ) . from a theoretical perspective , the @xmath4 relation is actually a manifestation of the inverse scaling of the break frequency of the agn psd with the black hole mass , since the excess variance is the integral of the psd over frequency domain @xcite .",
    "in fact , a break of the @xmath4 relation at low bh masses had been predicted based on the current understanding of the psd of agn @xcite , and the exact break mass ( the mass at which the break occurs ) depends on the shape of the psd .",
    "therefore , a study of the @xmath4 relation in the low - mass regime may provide a constraint on the break mass , as well as the shape of agn psd .    in this paper , we study the @xmath4 relation in the @xmath15 range , using an optically selected low - mass agn sample from our previous work @xcite .",
    "we use both new observations and archival data obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , as well as archival data of _ rosat_. this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the introduction of our sample and data reduction are presented in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "the excess variance is introduced , as well as the psd models of agn concerned in this study .",
    "the results and discussion are presented in section 4 . throughout the paper ,",
    "a cosmology with @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is adopted .",
    "there are over 300 low - mass ( type 1 ) agn with @xmath19 known so far .",
    "the largest is from our work @xcite , which was selected homogeneously from the sloan digital sky survey ( dr4 ) , and comprises 309 objects with @xmath20 .",
    "the bh masses were estimated from the luminosity and the width of the broad h@xmath21 line , using the virial mass formalism of @xcite .",
    "one feature of this sample is the accurate measurements of the agn spectral parameters , and hence the black hole masses and eddington ratios .",
    "compared to previous samples , this sample is more complete as it includes more objects with low eddington ratios down to @xmath22 ( see also @xcite ) . we compile a working sample of low - mass agn with usable x - ray data from this parent sample .",
    "we search for x - ray observations from both the _ xmm - newton _ and _ rosat _ pspc data archives to maximize the sample size . for _ xmm - newton _ observations",
    "the 3xmm - dr4 catalogue is used .",

    "( proposal i d : 074422 , pi : w. yuan ) .",
    "we consider only observations with exposure time longer than 10ks .",

    "observations for 16 objects and 6 _ rosat _ observations for 6 objects found in the archives .",
    "the new observations of j0914 + 0853 , j1347 + 4743 , and j1153 + 4612 were performed by _ xmm - newton _ at faint imaging mode on november 1st , 22nd , and december 4th 2014 with an exposure time of 36ks , 31ks , and 14ks , respectively .",

    "background light curves are extracted from source - free circles with the same radius .",
    "finally the sas task epiclccorr is applied to make corrections for each of the _ xmm - newton _ light curves .",
    "the energy band 0.2 - 10kev is used .",
    "the time bins of the light curves are chosen to be 250s , which are the same as in p12 for easy comparison . as demonstration , figure [ fig1 ] shows some of the typical light curves ( panels 1 - 4 ) .    for _ rosat _",

    "typical source extraction regions are circles of 50 arcsec radius , and the same aperture is used to extract background light curves .",
    "the energy band for _ rosat _ observations is 0.1 - 2.4kev .",
    "the time bins are also set to be 250s for the same reason .",
    "examples of the _ rosat _ light curves are also shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( panel 5 ) .",
    "all the light curves exhibit significant variability on short timescales , as shown in the figure .",
    "for a few sources , due to short observational interval and relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , the intrinsic variability is overwhelmed by random fluctuations because of the large statistical uncertainties ( the statistical uncertainty is larger than the source variability ; see section 3.1 for the definition of the excess variance ) . in such cases a meaningful excess variance can not be obtained and its value is consistent with being zero ( the same situation also happened in some objects or observations in previous studies , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we find that such sources mostly have the mean s / n below 2.3 .",
    "we thus introduce a cutoff on the mean s / n , below which the sources are dropped.2.5 ) above the threshold ( j1720 + 5748 , observed with _ rosat _ ) turns out to have the intrinsic variability consistent with zero .",
    "this is likely due to the stochastic nature of the x - ray variability of agn , which happens to result in little variations within a relatively short time span .",

    "the light curves of agn are simply stochastic , meaning that each observed light curve is only one realization of the underlying random variability process , and each realization can exhibit a slightly different mean count rate and variance .",
    "the random fluctuations between different realizations lead to non - ignorable scatter in the excess variance .",

    "in fact , the low - mass sample objects themselves do not show any correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 ( the spearman s correlation test gives a null probability of 0.42 ) . to quantify the statistical significance of this deviation , we perform two statistical tests , assuming that the previous inverse linear relation is a good description of the @xmath4 relation over the entire mass range .",
    "first , we use the two - sided binomial test to find out the probability of having 18 out of 19 low - mass agn fall below the relation as observed , whereas an equal probability ( 50% ) of falling on either side of the relation is expected .",
    "this gives a probability of @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , we fit an inverse linear relation with the slope fixed at -1 in the log - log space to the data of both the low - mass and the p12 sample .",
    "the reduced @xmath66 of the fit is 836/53 .",
    "then we assume that the inverse linear relation breaks to a constant at masses below a so - called break mass , which is fitted as a free parameter .",
    "the @xmath66 value for this model is 705/52 ( the break mass is fitted to be @xmath67 ) .",
    "this improves the fit dramatically by reducing the @xmath68 by @xmath69 for one additional free parameter .",
    "despite the fact that although the fitting is statistically not acceptable in terms of the large reduced @xmath68 ( may arise from some intrinsic scatters inherent to the relationship ) , as an approximation , we employ the f - test @xcite to test the significance of adding the flattening term does not improve the fit .",
    "this yields a small @xmath70-value 0.003 .",
    "we thus conclude that the flattening of the inverse linear @xmath4 relation toward low - mass agn is statistically significant .",
    "the fitted break mass is @xmath71 .",

    "the confidence contours of the two parameters are shown in figure [ fig5 ] ( right panel ) .",
    "this indicates that the apparently large scatter of @xmath0 can mostly be attributed to the uncertainty of each of the measurements ( including both the measurement and the stochastic uncertainties ) , and the intrinsic dispersion is small , but non - negligible ( the standard deviation of @xmath77 @xmath78 at the 68% confidence level ) .",
    "it may also suggest that the dependence of @xmath0 on any other parameters ( e.g. accretion rate ) is likely not strong .",
    "ccc    a & @xmath79 & 2048/53 + b & @xmath80 & 598/52 + c & @xmath81 & 820/53 +    in conclusion , the previously found inverse scaling of @xmath4 for agn with supermassive black holes can not be extrapolated to the low - mass regime , but starts to flatten at around @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that , although the excess variance can still be used to search for agn with @xmath83 , it fails to provide accurate black hole mass estimation in this mass range .",
    "this result is consistent with that obtained in a recent paper by @xcite .",
    "it is also suggested that , for agn in the @xmath3 range , the intrinsic dispersion of the excess variances is likely to be small [ standard deviation of @xmath77 @xmath78 ] .",

    "we take the three psd models in section 3.2 , and fix the @xmath85 relation as their original forms .",
    "since the psd amplitude @xmath86 was determined by fitting the @xmath4 relation in previous work @xcite , it is set to be a free parameter here ( two parameters @xmath21 and @xmath6 for model b since @xmath56 ) .",

    "the black , red and blue solid lines represent the relations for three typical accretion rates ( @xmath88 ) , respectively , which are the mean ( in logarithm ) of @xmath5 in three @xmath5 bins ( 0.01 - 0.1 , 0.1 - 0.5 , and 0.5 - 4.0 ) . the objects with @xmath5 in the three @xmath5 bins are plotted in corresponding colors .",
    "it can be seen that all the three models can reproduce the observed trend of the @xmath4 relation well quantitatively . for a given accretion rate , an inverse proportion is predicted in the high @xmath7 regime , whereas in the low - mass regime it flattens toward lower @xmath7 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath7 at which the relation starts to flatten ( the break mass ) depends on @xmath5 : the higher @xmath5 , the larger the break mass .",
    "this trend generally holds for all the three psd models , although the break mass varies from model to model , in addition to its dependence on @xmath5 .    besides this general trend , there are some noticeable differences between the three models . for model",
    "a , the strong dependence on @xmath5 leads to a large scatter in high - mass regime over a range of @xmath5 .",
    "model b predicts a smaller scatter , but the scatter is relatively larger in the low - mass than in the high - mass regime .",
    "compared to model a , model c also predicts a smaller scatter over the whole @xmath7 range , given its weak dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath5 .",
    "the inverse proportion of the @xmath4 relation and its flattening toward low @xmath7 can easily be understood from eq.(5 ) and figure [ fig3 ] . for @xmath89 ( e.g. ngc 3227 in figure [ fig3 ] ) , as @xmath46 increases ( and @xmath7 decreases , since @xmath90 ) , the integral of the psd within [ @xmath91 , @xmath92 increases accordingly , resulting in a linearly increasing @xmath0 .",
    "thus the previously known @xmath4 relation ( for @xmath93 ) is a manifestation of the more fundamental dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath7 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it also shows that the secondary dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath5 introduces a scatter , the extent of which depends on the models . for @xmath94 ( e.g. mrk 766 ) ,",
    "the relation becomes non - linear .",
    "for @xmath95 ( e.g. j1023 + 0405 ) , @xmath0 becomes independent of @xmath46 ( thus of @xmath7 ) and remains a constant .",
    "we have shown that the observed @xmath4 relation over almost the whole @xmath7 range for agn of @xmath96 can be explained qualitatively by the psd shape of agn and the dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath7 , although the exact relation depends on the details of the models .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate which of the above models give a better description of the data , taking advantage of the extended @xmath7 range provided by our sample .",
    "here we discuss this issue only briefly by comparing the deviations of the data from the models in terms of the fitted @xmath68 , although they are too large for the fits to be acceptable _ nominally _ for all the three models ( the large @xmath68 values are partly due to the somewhat large uncertainties in @xmath7 and @xmath5 , which are not taken into account in the fitting ) .",
    "we discuss the three models , respectively .",
    "( 1 ) model a has a much larger @xmath68 value than model b and c , and is likely not a good description of the data .",
    "the same suggestion was also argued by @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) for model b , the fitted parameter @xmath6 ( @xmath97 ) is consistent with that of @xcite . for the objects with @xmath20",
    ", no correlation is found between @xmath0 and @xmath5 ( the spearman correlation test gives a null probability @xmath98 ) , which seems to be inconsistent to the model prediction ( see figure [ fig6 ] , middle panel ) .",
    "however , this may be partly due to the uncertainties in determining @xmath5 .",
    "( 3 ) for model c , our result yields a psd amplitude consistent with that of @xcite , which is only weakly dependent on @xmath5 .",
    "this leads the excess variances converging to a constant value toward low @xmath7 , which is roughly consistent with the small intrinsic scatter ( not zero , however ) found above .",
    "overall , based on the fitted @xmath68 values ( table [ tbl2 ] ) , we tend to consider models b , and perhaps model c to be better descriptions of the psd shape of agn",
    ". however , a rigorous comparison of the psd models is beyond the scope of this paper and will be carried out in future work with a larger sample and better quality of data .",
    "the @xmath4 relation for agn in the low - mass regime ( @xmath13 ) is investigated using a sample of 11 low - mass agn observed by _ xmm - newton _ and _ rosat _ , including both new observations and archival data , as well as 8 sources from @xcite .",
    "we find that , the inverse linear @xmath4 relation established in the high - mass regime in previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) fails to extend to @xmath7 below @xmath14 .",
    "the relation becomes to flatten at @xmath2 , below which the excess variances seem to remain constant .",
    "our result is in good agreement with that obtained from a recent similar study by @xcite .",
    "this is in fact consistent with the model prediction from our current understanding of the psd of agn and the dependence of the break frequency @xmath46 on @xmath7 .",
    "our result suggests that while the x - ray excess variance may still be used to search for low - mass agn candidates , it fails to provide reliable estimation of the black hole mass for agn with @xmath19 . in this @xmath7 regime",
    ", it is also found that the excess variances show small intrinsic dispersion , when their uncertainties ( both measurement and stochastic ) are taken into account .",
