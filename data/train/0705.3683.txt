    "wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) comprise many tiny , low - cost , battery - powered sensors in a small area  @xcite .",
    "the sensors detect environmental variations and then transmit the detection results to other sensors or a base station  @xcite .",
    "one or several sensors then collect the detection results from other sensors .",
    "the collected data must be processed by the sensor to reduce the transmission burden before they are transmitted to the base station .",
    "this process is called _ data fusion _ and the sensor performing data fusion is the _ fusion node_. the fusion data may be sent from the fusion node to the base station through multiple hops  @xcite or a direct link  @xcite .",
    "although fusion significantly lowers the traffic between the fusion node and the base station , the fusion node is more critical and vulnerable to malicious attacks than non - fusion sensors  @xcite .",
    "if a fusion node is compromised , then the base station can not ensure the correctness of the fusion data sent to it .",
    "this problem of fusion data assurance arises because the detection results are not sent directly to the base station , so the fusion result can not usually be verified .",
    "this problem can be resolved in two ways : one is hardware - based  @xcite and the other is software - based  @xcite . since the hardware - based approach requires extra circuits to detect or frustrate the compromised node , the cost and continual power consumption of sensors are increased but still can not guarantee protection against all attacks .",
    "conversely , the software methods generally require no or little extra hardware for data assurance .",
    "however , as mentioned in  @xcite , several copies of the fusion data must be sent to the base station , the power consumption for the data transmission is very high .",
    "the witness - based approach presented by du _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite does not have this difficulty .",
    "several fusion nodes are used to fuse the collected data and have the ability to communicate with the base station .",
    "only one node is chosen to transmit the fusion result to the base station .",
    "the other fusion nodes , serving as witnesses , encrypt the fusion results to message authentication codes ( macs ) .",
    "the macs are then sent to the base station through the chosen fusion node .",
    "finally , the base station utilizes the received macs to verify the received fusion data .",
    "the verification could be wrong since the chosen node could be compromised and forge macs .",
    "the correctness of the verification depends not only on the number of malicious fusion nodes , but also on the length of the mac . a long mac increases the reliability of the verification .",
    "however , the transmission of the long mac imposes a high communication burden .",
    "if the received fusion result at the base station can not pass the verification , then a polling scheme is started to determine whether any valid fusion result is available at the other fusion nodes .",
    "in addition to the fusion result sent by the malicious fusion node , several copies of the correct fusion result may also have to be transmitted to the base station .",
    "the transmission of the correct fusion result consumes the power of the uncompromised fusion node .",
    "this work develops a new data fusion assurance to improve the witness - based method of du _",
    "et al . _",
    "the correctness of the verification in the proposed scheme depends only on the number of compromised fusion nodes . as in the witness - based approach ,",
    "a fusion node is selected to transmit the fusion result , while other fusion nodes serve as witnesses .",
    "nevertheless , the base station obtains votes contributing to the transmitted fusion result directly from the witness nodes .",
    "no valid fusion data are available if the transmitted fusion data are not approved by a pre - set number of witness nodes .",
    "based on this voting mechanism , two schemes are addressed : one needs variant rounds of voting and the other needs only one round of voting . in the variant - round scheme , only one copy of the correct fusion data provided by one uncompromised fusion node is transmitted to the base station .",
    "analytical and simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme is up to @xmath0 times better on the overhead than that of du _",

    "this network architecture is similar to the so - called sensor with mobile access ( senma )  @xcite , message ferry  @xcite , and data mule  @xcite . at the @xmath3th sensor , one observation @xmath4",
    "is undertaken for one of phenomena @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "if the detection ( raw ) data are transmitted to the fusion nodes without any processing , then the transmission imposes a very high communication burden .",
    "hence , each sensor must make a local decision based on the raw data before transmission .",
    "the decisions , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , can be represented with fewer symbols than the raw data .",

    "unless all of the fusion nodes or all of the sensors fail , this detection and fusion scheme can guarantee that the base station can obtain the detection result .",
    "however , the accuracy of the result is not certain .",
    "two problems must be solved to ensure that the base station obtain the correct result .",
    "first , every fusion node must correctly fuse all of the local decisions , which also implies that all of the fusion results must be the same .",
    "several algorithms have been proposed to deal with this problem  @xcite .",
    "this work assumes that this problem has been solved .",
    "the second problem concerns assurance of the fusion result .",
    "the transmission between the fusion node and the base station is assumed herein to be error - free .",
    "since some fusion nodes may be compromised , the fusion node chosen by the base station to transmit the fusion result may be one of the compromised nodes .",
    "malicious data may be sent by the compromised node , and the base station can not discover the compromised nodes from the normal fusion nodes since the data detected by the sensor are not sent directly to the base station .",
    "consequently , the result obtained at the base station may be incorrect .",
    "du _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a witness - based approach to ensure the correctness of the fusion result .",
    "all fusion nodes , other than the chosen node , acts as witnesses of the transmitted fusion result .",

    "since the number of the transmitted macs is @xmath14 , the number of the transmitted bits , in addition to the fusion result , is @xmath15 .",
    "the probability that the base station accepts the forged fusion result is given by @xmath16 for instance , consider the majority voting rule in which @xmath17 .",
    "to ensure that @xmath18 , set @xmath19 . additionally ,",
    "although only one copy of the fusion result is sent to the base station in this witness - based approach , the witness nodes still requires significant communication bandwidth because the macs of the fusion results are transmitted .    to compare the proposed scheme fairly with the witness - based approach , the _ overhead _",
    "is defined as the total number of bits , except the bits for _ one _ copy of the correct fusion result , transmitted to the base station by _ uncompromised _ nodes during the data assurance process .",
    "the overhead can therefore be regarded as the _ useful _ power consumed for the data assurance .",
    "moreover , the _ round delay _ is defined as the number of rounds required to collect all macs ( votes ) from the witness nodes and the _ polling delay _",
    "the number of votes ( including all agree and disagree voting ) .",
    "the overhead of the witness - based approach given in  @xcite is then derived as follows .",

    "the base station randomly specifies another fusion node .",
    "the new chosen node then sends its fusion result and all macs from the witness nodes to the base station .",
    "when the number of compromised fusion nodes , @xmath20 , is greater than @xmath21 but less than @xmath9 , compromised nodes are assumed to collude to forge a wrong fusion result .",

    "the power of the uncompromised nodes is significantly wasted . moreover , because each chosen node has to collects all macs from the witness nodes , the average round delay , @xmath30 , is @xmath23 and the average polling delay @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "conversely , when the number of uncompromised nodes is greater than @xmath10 , the base station can obtain the correct fusion result .",

    "a large amount of power must be consumed for this transmission , significantly reducing the lifetime of the fusion node .",
    "the problem of power consumption is even worse when the fusion result is invalid .",

    "this design is reasonable when the witness node does not know about the fusion result at the chosen node .",
    "however , in practice , the base station can transmit the fusion result of the chosen node to the witness or the witness node is in the communication range of the chosen node and the base station .",
    "therefore , the witness node can obtain the transmitted fusion result from the chosen node through the base station or overhearing .",
    "the witness node then can compare the transmitted fusion result with its own fusion result .",
    "finally , the witness node can send its vote ( agreement or disagreement ) on the transmitted result directly to the base station , rather than through the chosen node .",

    "hence , the overhead of the scheme is independent of the size of the fusion result .",
    "this claim can be proven by the following argument . in the case of a valid fusion result , when the fusion result from an uncompromised node is sent to the base station at a round of polling , the polling process stops at this round and the valid fusion result is obtained by the base station .",
