    "it is useful to consider the modes @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the phase at the auxiliary node @xmath44 .",
    "the modes @xmath45 behave as harmonic oscillators described by the hamiltonians @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are the canonically conjugate momenta to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the capacitance between each of the nodes @xmath51 or @xmath52 and ground .",
    "the modes @xmath53 in turn are influenced by the dc - squid .",

    "we choose the indices @xmath57 for the auxiliary nodes such that node @xmath20 couples to the qubits at nodes @xmath15 and @xmath16 whereas node @xmath22 couples to the qubits at nodes @xmath17 and @xmath58 , see fig .",

    "the full hamiltonian of the lattice is therefore given by @xmath61\\ ] ] a detailed derivation of the hamiltonian @xmath62 , starting from a lagrangian for the circuit , is provided in appendix [ sec : lagrangian ] .",
    "we now turn to explain how the four - body interactions of the stabilizers emerge in our architecture .",
    "the guiding idea for our approach comes from the following approximate consideration ( we present a quantitatively precise derivation in sec .  [",
    "sec : elim - squid ] ) . in each single cell , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice - main]b , the auxiliary nodes @xmath20 and @xmath22 have very small capacitances with respect to ground and therefore can not accumulate charge . as a consequence the node phases @xmath63 and @xmath64 are not dynamical degrees of freedom but instantly follow the phases at nodes @xmath15 and @xmath16 or @xmath17 and @xmath58 as given by kirchoff s current law saying that the sum of all currents into and out of such a node must vanish .",
    "therefore the josephson energy of the coupling squid , @xmath65 , becomes a nonlinear function of the node phases @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which contains four - body terms .",
    "the external flux applied through the squid is then chosen such that it triggers the desired four - body interactions forming the stabilizers . to this end",
    "it is composed of a constant part with associated phase @xmath70 and an oscillating part associated with phase amplitude @xmath71 , @xmath72 where the oscillation frequencies of @xmath73 are linear combinations of the qubit transition frequencies such that the desired four - body spin interactions of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : toric - code - ham ] ) are enabled and all other interaction terms are suppressed .",
    "moreover we choose @xmath74 to suppress the critical current @xmath75 of the dc - squid @xcite and thus unwanted interactions of excitations between qubits at opposite sides of it , c.f .",
    "[ fig : lattice - main]b . assuming furthermore that the oscillating part of the flux bias is small compared to the constant part , we approximate @xmath76 .",
    "the above consideration uses approximations and only serves us as a guide . to obtain a quantitatively precise picture",
    ", we here take the small but finite capacitances of the josephson junctions in the squid into account and derive the stabilizer interactions in a fully quantum mechanical approach .",
    "our derivation makes use of methods for generating effective four - body hamiltonians in the low energy sector of a two - body hamiltonian @xcite by employing a schrieffer - wolff transformation and combines these with multi - tone driving in order to single out specific many - body interactions while fully suppressing all two - body interactions",
    ".    further intuition for our approach can be obtained from the macroscopic analogy explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy ] . in short ,",
    "the plasma frequency of the coupling squids differs form all transition frequencies of the qubits they couple to as well as from all frequencies contained in the oscillating flux that is threaded through their loops .",
    "they thus decouple from the qubits but mediate the desired four - body interactions via the drives applied to them .",
    "further details of this analogy are explained in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy ] .",
    "we now turn to present the quantitatively precise derivation .",
    "macroscopic analogy providing an intuitive explanation of our approach to generate the stabilizer interactions .",
    "the qubits are nonlinear oscillators so that one can think of them as masses ( corresponding to the qubits capacitances ) attached to anharmonic springs ( corresponding to the qubits josephson energy ) .",
    "we here sketch four nonlinear oscillators representing four qubits as green spheres connected by black ( anharmonic ) springs to the support frame .",
    "note that all four qubits have different transition frequencies so that all four spheres representing them here would have different masses and their springs different spring constants .",
    "for vanishing critical current the relevant squid modes @xmath53 , behave as harmonic oscillators and in our macroscopic analogy we can represent them by a mass ( here sketched as a red sphere , corresponding to the capacitance @xmath77 ) that is attached via four springs ( sketched in orange , corresponding to the inductors @xmath19 ) to the four masses representing the neighboring qubits . for vanishing critical current ,",
    "the only potential energy of the modes @xmath53 comes from their inductive coupling to the neighboring qubits , and hence the mass representing the squid mode ( red sphere ) has no spring connecting it to a support frame .",
    "we now imagine that we shake the mass representing the squid mode with a driving term that is proportional to the fourth power of the mass position variable , @xmath78 .",
    "this corresponds to the oscillating flux bias @xmath79 .",
    "if we shake this mass at a frequency @xmath80 that is distinct from its eigenfrequency @xmath81 but equals the sum of the oscillation frequencies of all four neighboring masses ( neighboring qubits ) , we drive a term proportional to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 creates an excitation in qubit @xmath38 . if , on the other hand we shake the squid - mass at a frequency @xmath84 we drive a term proportional to @xmath85",
    ". the selective driving of specific four - body terms , as we consider it here , of course relies on choosing the transition frequencies of all four qubits to be different .",
    "our approach considers a superposition of various drive frequencies such that the sum of the triggered four - body terms adds up to the desired stabilizer interaction , see text . ]      for the parameters of our architecture , the oscillation frequencies of the squid modes @xmath48 differ from the transition frequencies of the qubits and the frequencies of the time dependent fluxes threaded through the squid loops by an amount that exceeds their mutual couplings by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "these modes will thus remain in their ground states to very high precision . to eliminate them from the description and obtain an effective hamiltonian for the qubits only , it is useful to consider the schrieffer - wolff transformation @xmath86 which eliminates the qubit - squid interactions described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qubit - squid - coupling ] ) .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the qubits is then obtained by projecting the resulting hamiltonian onto the ground states of the squid modes @xmath48 .",
    "the details of this derivation are discussed in appendix [ sec : eff - ham ] .    for the transformed hamiltonian @xmath87 , see eq .",

    "( [ eq : drive ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a truncation of the expansion is here well justified since both fields @xmath90 and @xmath47 have low enough amplitudes , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : schriefferwolffamplitude ] ) , so that higher order terms can safely be ignored .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 with @xmath93 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qubitham ] ) describes the individual qubits and @xmath94 interactions between neighboring qubits that are ineffective since their transition frequencies differ by an amount that exceeds the relevant coupling strength by more than an order of magnitude , see appendix [ sec : first - order - corrs - adiabat ] .",

    "( [ eq : ham - squids-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : nonlinear ] ) in appendix [ sec : eff - ham ] .",
    "since the oscillation frequencies of the squid modes are chosen such that they can not be excited by the applied driving fields or via their coupling to the qubits , an effective hamiltonian , describing only the qubits , can be obtained by projecting @xmath96 onto the ground states of the squid modes , @xmath97 as the squid modes remain in their ground states , their hamiltonian @xmath95 may be discarded .",
    "the projected hamiltonian @xmath98 contains two - body interactions and four - body interactions between the qubits , @xmath99 with @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the ground state of the mode @xmath102 .",
    "we emphasize here that our approach requires nonlinear coupling circuits , such as the considered squids .",
    "the terms in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : projectgs1 ] ) , which give rise to the desired four - body interactions , only emerge because the hamiltonian of the coupling squids contains terms that are at least fourth power in @xmath102 , see appendix [ sec : eff - ham ] .",
    "the oscillation frequencies contained in the external flux , i.e. in @xmath103 , can be chosen such that selected terms in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : projectgs1 ] ) are enabled as they become resonant . for suitable amplitudes of the frequency components of @xmath103 , these terms add up to the desired four - body stabilizer interactions whereas all other interactions contained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : projectgs1 ] ) are for our choice of parameters strongly suppressed in a rotating wave approximation .    before discussing this point in more detail in the next section ,",
    "let us here emphasize the versatility of our approach : with suitably chosen fourier components of @xmath103 almost any two- , three- or four - body interaction can be generated .",
    "the only limitation here is that terms with the same rotation frequency can not be distinguished , e.g. one can not choose between generating @xmath104 or @xmath105 for @xmath106 which are both non - rotating . on the other hand , straightforward modifications of the circuit allow to implement higher than four - body ( e.g. five- and six - body ) interactions .",
    "we now focus on the interactions between the four qubits in one cell only , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice - main]b . to simplify the notation we label these four qubits clockwise with indices 1,2,3 and 4 , i.e. @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    "note that the effective josephson energy @xmath125 includes here contributions of the attached inductances , see appendix [ sec:2nd - quantized ] for details . due to the qubit nonlinearities we can restrict the description to the two lowest energy levels of each node by replacing @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) and get for the four - body interactions , @xmath128 here , the sum @xmath129 runs over all 16 possible strings of @xmath130 and @xmath131 operators , which are listed in table [ tab:1 ] in appendix [ sec : rot - frame ] .",
    "the explicit form of the hamiltonians @xmath132 in second quantized form is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : two_body_rotating ] ) .",
    "the terms contained in @xmath133 only lead to frequency shifts for the qubits and negligible two - body interactions .",
    "the frequency shifts can be compensated for by modified frequencies for the driving fields and the residual two - body interactions can be made two orders of magnitude smaller than the targeted four - body interactions , see sec .",
    "[ sec : four - body - ints ] and appendix [ sec : perturbations ] .",
    "moreover the terms contained in @xmath134 only lead to corrections that are at least an order of magnitude smaller than those of @xmath133 and can safely be discarded , see appendix [ sec : residual-2body - app ] . here , we therefore focus on the part @xmath135 which gives rise to the dominant terms in the form of four - body stabilizer interactions .      in a rotating frame where each qubit rotates at its transition frequency , @xmath136 [ @xmath137 , the strings @xmath138 that appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1-rot ] ) rotate at the frequencies @xmath139 . hence",
    ", if we thread a magnetic flux , which oscillates at the frequency @xmath140 , through the squid loop , the corresponding operator @xmath138 acquires a pre - factor with oscillation frequency @xmath140 , which renders the term non - oscillating and hence enables this particular four - body interaction .",
    "importantly , all qubits of a cell have different transition frequencies such that a drive with frequency @xmath140 only enables the particular interaction @xmath138 whereas all other interactions are suppressed by their fast oscillating prefactors .",
    "as the star and plaquette interactions @xmath141 and @xmath142 can be written as linear combinations of operator products @xmath138 , their generation requires magnetic fluxes that are a superposition of oscillations at the respective frequencies . to enable the specific four - body interactions of the toric code we thus consider , @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 with @xmath146 . the driving field @xmath147 generates a star interaction @xmath13 and @xmath148 a plaquette interaction @xmath14 .",
    "hence star and plaquette interactions only differ by the relative sign of the @xmath149 and @xmath150 contributions corresponding to a relative phase of @xmath151 of the respective fourier components . applying @xmath147 or @xmath148 to a cell",
    ", its hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham1-rot ] ) thus reads ,    @xmath152    where @xmath153 refers to the remaining fast rotating terms , and @xmath154 note that the signs and magnitudes of the interactions @xmath155 and @xmath156 can for each cell be tuned independently via the respective choices for the drive amplitudes @xmath71 .    besides the stabilizer interactions , there are further terms in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : transformed - ham ] ) .",
    "as we show in appendix [ sec : perturbations ] , all these other interactions are strongly suppressed by their fast oscillating prefactors ( the oscillation frequencies of the prefactors exceed the interaction strengths by more than an order of magnitude in all cases ) . their effect can be estimated using time dependent perturbation theory .",
    "we find for our parameters that they lead to frequency shifts for the individual qubits , which can be compensated for by a modification of the frequencies of the driving field @xmath103 . for our choice of qubit transition frequencies , where no nearest neighbors or next nearest neighbors of qubits have the same transition frequencies , the leading corrections to the toric code hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : toric - code - ham ] ) , besides local frequency shifts , are two - body interactions between qubits that are further apart ( i.e. neither nearest neighbors nor next neighrest neighbors ) . for suitable parameters as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : parameters ] , these interactions are about two orders of magnitude weaker than the stabilizers and thus even weaker than dissipation processes in the device , see appendix [ sec : perturbations ] .    in this context",
    ", we also note that the leading contribution to the perturbations of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : toric - code - ham ] ) is proportional to the charging energy @xmath157 of the employed qubits , c.f .",

    "hence the considered transmon qubits are a well suited choice for our aims .",

    "<S> we show that the hamiltonian of the central model of this class of systems , the toric code , can be directly implemented as an analog quantum simulator in lattices of superconducting circuits . the four - body interactions , which lie at its heart , are in our concept realized via superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) that are driven by a suitably oscillating flux bias . </S>",
    "<S> all physical qubits and coupling squids can be individually controlled with high precision . </S>",
    "<S> topologically ordered states can be prepared via an adiabatic ramp of the stabilizer interactions . </S>",
    "<S> strings of qubit operators , including the stabilizers and correlations along non - contractible loops , can be read out via a capacitive coupling to read - out resonators . moreover , the available single qubit operations allow to create and propagate elementary excitations of the toric code and to verify their fractional statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the architecture we propose allows to implement a large variety of many - body interactions and thus provides a versatile analog quantum simulator for topological order and lattice gauge theories .    </S>",
    "<S> topological phases of quantum matter @xcite are of scientific interest for their intriguing quantum correlation properties , exotic excitations with fractional and non - abelian quantum statistics , and their prospects for physically protecting quantum information against errors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model which takes the central role in the discussion of topological order is the toric code @xcite , which is an example of a @xmath0 lattice gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a two - dimensional spin lattice with quasi local four - body interactions between the spins and features @xmath1 degenerate , topologically ordered ground states for a lattice on a surface of genus @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the topological order of these @xmath1 ground states shows up in their correlation properties . </S>",
    "<S> the topologically ordered states are locally indistinguishable ( the reduced density matrices of a single spin are identical for all of them ) and only show differences for global properties ( correlations along non - contractible loops ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover local perturbations can not transform these states into one another and can therefore only excite higher energy states that are separated by a finite energy gap . in equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> the toric code ground states are therefore protected against local perturbations that are small compared to the gap , which renders them ideal candidates for storing quantum information @xcite . yet for a self - correcting quantum memory , the mobility of excitations needs to be suppressed as well , which so far has only been shown to be achievable in four or more lattice dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> excitations above the ground states of the toric code are therefore generated by any string of spin rotations with open boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the study of these excitations , called anyons , is of great interest as the neither show bosonic nor fermionic but fractional statistics @xcite .    in two dimensions </S>",
    "<S> , the toric code can be visualized as a square lattice where the spin-1/2 degrees of freedom are placed on the edges , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice - main]a . stabilizer operators can be defined for this lattice as products of @xmath3-operators for all four spins around a star ( orange diamond in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice - main]a ) , i.e. @xmath4 , and products of @xmath5-operators for all four spins around a plaquette ( green diamond in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice - main]a ) , i.e. @xmath6 . the hamiltonian for this system reads , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the strength of the star ( plaquette ) interactions and the sums @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) run over all stars ( plaquettes ) in the lattice @xcite .    despite the intriguing perspectives for quantum computation and for exploring strongly correlated condensed matter physics that a realization of the toric code hamiltonian would offer , progress towards its implementation has to date been inhibited by the difficulties in realising clean and strong four - body interactions while at the same time suppressing two - body interactions to a sufficient extent . </S>",
    "<S> realisations of topologically encoded qubits have been reported in superconducting qubits @xcite , photons @xcite and trapped ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is an important difference , however , in the use and purpose of an implementation of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : toric - code - ham ] ) compared to error detection via stabilizer measurements as pursued in @xcite . in particular , two - body interactions are all that is needed for arbitrary stabiliser measurements , while lattice gauge theories @xcite and hamiltonians such as ( [ eq : toric - code - ham ] ) require @xmath11-body ( with @xmath12 ) effective interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the realisation of @xmath11-body interactions is also important in quantum annealing architectures , where implementations have been proposed utilising local interactions and many - body constraints @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that the approach we describe here may also be relevant for quantum annealing , however our focus in this paper is on the realisation of hamiltonians supporting topological order .    </S>",
    "<S> superconducting circuits have recently made tremendous advances in realizing engineered quantum dynamics for quantum simulation @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their quantum features originate from integrated josephson junctions that behave like ideal nonlinear inductors . </S>",
    "<S> they are typically built as squids that can be tuned and driven via magnetic fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> currently superconducting circuits are assembled in ever larger connected networks @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we make use of these exquisite properties of superconducting circuits for a scheme implementing the hamiltonian of the two - dimensional toric code in a direct way by creating four - body interactions of the form @xmath4 and @xmath6 between the respective qubits and fully suppressing all two - body interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> superconducting circuits are an ideal platform for experimentally exploring topological order since high precision control and measurements of both , individual qubits as well as multi - qubit clusters have been demonstrated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this platform is also suitable for realizing periodic boundary conditions , since conductors can cross each other via air - bridges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this property , which is essential for exploring topological order , is so far not accessible in other platforms unless one resorts to digitized approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach is designed to keep the necessary circuitry as simple as possible and only employs standard superconducting qubits that are coupled via dc - squids @xcite . to generate the desired interactions we make use of the nonlinear nature of the coupling squids and the possibilities to bias them with constant and oscillating magnetic fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the four - body stabilizer interactions of the toric code are generated by driving the squids with suitably oscillating magnetic fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> they can therefore be switched on and off at desired times or even be smoothly tuned in strength . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the toric code hamiltonian is realized in a frame where the qubits rotate at their transition frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the transformation between the rotating and the laboratory frame is composed of single qubit unitaries only , so that the entanglement properties of the states are identical in both frames . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to earlier approaches to multi - body interactions based on gate sequences @xcite , the four - body interactions in our approach are directly implemented as an analog quantum simulator and are therefore time - independent , which avoids any errors routed in the trotter sequencing . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> our approach suppresses two - body interactions to an extent that they are negligible compared to the four - body interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> a minimal two - dimensional lattice covering the surface of a torus requires eight qubits connected via superconducting wires such that the lattice has periodic boundary conditions in both directions and is thus realizable with available technology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that protected states of the toric code can be prepared via an adiabatic sweep from a product state for experimentally realizable parameters and that measurements of individual qubits and qubit - qubit correlations can be performed to demonstrate the topological order of these states .     </S>",
