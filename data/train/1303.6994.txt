    "helical luttinger liquids , in which the spin of the electrons is locked to their direction of motion , are a central ingredient for a number of recent theoretical proposals and experiments aiming at the detection of zero energy majorana bound states.@xcite besides their emergence as topological edge states@xcite and their formation in topological insulator nanowires,@xcite ( quasi- ) helical luttinger liquids can for instance be engineered by placing carbon nanotubes in an electric field,@xcite by subjecting a rashba spin - orbit coupled quantum wire ( `` rashba nanowire '' ) to a magnetic field,@xcite or by appropriately coupling the electrons in a quantum wire to a kondo lattice in the rkky liquid regime , such as the the nuclear spins in the wire.@xcite    one convenient experimental signature of the helical state is provided by the electric conductance through the wire , which drops from @xmath2 to @xmath3 when the wire becomes helical.@xcite in a rashba nanowire , this interesting regime can be reached by tuning the chemical potential into the partial gap around zero momentum , see fig .",

    ", however , lowering the temperature sufficiently can lead to the formation of a helical electronic state due to a spontaneous ordering of the nuclear spins .",
    "@xcite in the remainder , we argue that the spin physics of the wire provides an additional and in fact complementary signature of this state , which can be probed by spin fluctuation or spin susceptibility measurements .",
    "thanks to considerable experimental advances , these measurements are now believed to be within reach.@xcite different from the conductance , the spin physics depends not only on the presence of a gap , but also on the spin state of the residual gapless modes .",
    "we find that the spin susceptibility and spin fluctuations become strongly anisotropic . the susceptibility is exponentially suppressed along the direction set by the spin - orbit coupling in the wire , and there are no low frequency spin fluctuation along this direction .",
    "related physics has been discussed in the context of the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction mediated by the edge states of quantum spin hall samples.@xcite while the spin su(2 ) symmetry is broken from the outset by the spin - orbit interaction and the magnetic field , the exponential suppression of the susceptibility along one direction , present only in the helical regime , is markedly different from the anisotropic power law decay of the spin susceptibility in non - helical rashba nanowires@xcite or carbon nanotubes.@xcite our analysis illustrates that interaction effects are important for the experimental detectability of the anisotropic spin physics , and furthermore quantifies the effect of the modes gapped by the combination of spin - orbit coupling and applied magnetic field , which are absent in ideal helical systems .",

    "the interaction @xmath85 is most conveniently analyzed by switching from the hamiltonian to the associated ( imaginary time @xmath33 ) action and integrating out @xmath87 .",
    "this yields an additional small renormalization of the velocities and luttinger liquid parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 , plus an interaction of the form @xmath88 , which is subleading for the same reason as @xmath84 .",

    "one may also go beyond this mean field argument by noting that @xmath92 , and that the correlation function of @xmath77 decays exponentially due to the gap .",
    "therefore , the expectation values involving @xmath77 are exponentials of an exponential and indeed go to unity very quickly .",
    "the remaining average over the gapless field @xmath93 yields the usual luttinger liquid power law decay .",
    "the components of the spin susceptibility perpendicular to the spin - orbit axis are thus given by    @xmath94    when performing the analytical continuation in order to derive the physically relevant retarded spin susceptibility , the oscillating factor in the last line of eq .",

    "the susceptibility along @xmath99 , on the other hand , reads    @xmath100    again , the field @xmath77 can be replaced by its average value and drops out .",
    "the field @xmath101 , being canonically conjugate to the ordered field @xmath77 , has large fluctuations that suppress @xmath52 . as has been established in refs .",
    "[ ] , and neglecting the additional phase factor due to the simultaneous presence of @xmath102 and @xmath103 fields , eq .   can be evaluated as    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is a constant of order one .",
    "the spin susceptibility in @xmath99 direction is thus indeed exponentially suppressed by the gap .",
    "the associated typical length scale is given by the renormalized short distance cut - off of the theory , @xmath106 .",
    "the suppression of the signal along @xmath99 is increased by electron - electron interactions , which strongly enhance the gap according to eq .  .",
    "the static parts of the retarded spin susceptibility in the momentum / frequency - domain can now be obtained by fourier transformation and analytic continuation . in @xmath8 and",

    "in real space , on the other hand , stronger interactions correspond to a weaker power law decay of the signal along @xmath8 and @xmath89 at large distances .    along @xmath99",

    "this renders the spin response effectively two - dimensional in spin space .",

    "@xmath126 , the spin fluctuation spectrum is thus proportional to @xmath127 , as could have been expected from a dimensional analysis of eq .  .",
    "in the @xmath99 direction , on the other hand , the fluctuations are gapped .",
    "this implies a vanishing @xmath128 for frequencies @xmath129 , as can be shown by fourier transformation of @xmath130 and subsequent analytic continuation . like the spin susceptibility , spin fluctuations are thus strongly anisotropic for frequencies smaller than the gap , and again",
    ", this anisotropy is strengthened by electron - electron interactions , which increase the gap @xmath86 and weaken the power law suppression of @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 and at low frequencies .",
    "in this work , we showed that a rashba nanowire in the helical regime ( and more generally any helical or quasi - helical luttinger liquid ) exhibits strongly anisotropic spin physics , and analyzed the latter in terms of the static spin susceptibility and the dynamic spin response .",
    "given that rashba nanowires can be mapped onto quantum wires with helical nuclear spin order,@xcite the same anisotropic spin physics also provides a specific signature of helical nuclear order in quantum wires . as discussed in sec .  [ sec : suscept ] , the helical regime is characterized by an exponentially suppressed static spin susceptibility along the direction set by the spin - orbit coupling , while it shows a power - law decay in the perpendicular directions . outside the helical regime ,",
    "on the other hand , the susceptibility exhibits a power law decay along all three directions .",
    "a strongly anisotropic behavior was also obtained for the dynamic properties of the spins , as has been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluct ] .",
    "in particular , we found that the spin fluctuation spectrum along the direction set by the spin - orbit interaction vanishes for frequencies below the gap , while it behaves as an interaction - dependent frequency power law in the perpendicular directions .",
    "we furthermore discussed that the strongly anisotropic character of the spin physics as well as the detectability of the susceptibility and the fluctuation spectrum in the perpendicular directions are importantly increased by electron - electron interactions . in conclusion",
    ", spin physics provides an additional experimental signature of the helical regime , and complements transport measurement @xcite and possible tunneling spectroscopy experiments .",
    "@xcite different from conductance measurements , which give only access to the number of gapless modes , the spin physics depends on the spin state of these modes .",
