    "long - range correlations in a fluid far from equilibrium is one of the most salient features of nonequilibrium fluctuations @xcite . since the seminal discovery of the @xmath8 enhancement of the rayleigh component of the structure factor in a fluid with an uniform temperature gradient by kirkpatrick , cohen and dorfman @xcite , where @xmath1 is",
    "the wave number , algebraic decays of correlation functions have been found theoretically in a wide class of nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the existence of such generic long - range correlations also have been confirmed in a series of the detailed light scattering experiments in pure liquids @xcite and in binary mixtures @xcite .",
    "although the agreement between the theoretical studies and the experimental ones are sufficiently quantitative , it have been limited to relatively high wave number regions .    on the other hand , large - scale , long - time behavior of such nonequilibrium fluctuations is attracting much more attentions in recent years @xcite .",
    "ultra - low - angle light scattering experiment performed by vailati and giglio @xcite have revealed an impressive gravity - induced quench of the @xmath8 divergence of the rayleigh line intensity at very small @xmath1 range @xcite in a binary mixture subjected to an uniform concentration gradient driven by the large soret effect .",
    "so far as we know , this is the first experimental demonstration that true asymptotic behavior of a long - range correlation at large distances is qualitatively different from that predicted by the linear response theory at short distances .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , the gravity - induced effect seems to be somewhat exceptional because it can be understood within the simple linear response theory . generally speaking ,",
    "a full nonlinear analysis of hydrodynamic equations is required for studying large - scale transport and fluctuation properties of a fluid @xcite . therefore , mainly because of its technical difficulty",
    ", studies beyond linear responses are rare in systems far from equilibrium so far .",
    "only one exception is a system undergoing uniform shear flow where effects of the shear advection can be treated in an analytic way @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted theoretically that the density autocorrelation function and the density - momentum correlation function in a sheared compressible fluid exhibit much weaker divergent behavior in small wave number limits than the @xmath8 divergence found in large wave numbers @xcite .",
    "a similar result has also been predicted for an incompressible fluid @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it might be difficult to verify these predictions directly by using available experimental techniques , because the crossover length scales of these systems are so macroscopic .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to emphasize effects of the shear upon long - range correlations which can allow an experimental confirmation . to this end",
    ", we consider the particularly simple system , a ( dilute ) low - molecular weight binary mixture with imposed concentration and uniform shear gradients @xcite . on the basis of fluctuating hydrodynamics approach @xcite",
    ", we calculate an static concentration autocorrelation function which contributes to the total intensity of the rayleigh peak in a light scattering experiment . in sec .",

    "we obtain general forms of space - time correlation functions of the hydrodynamic variables by solving the linearized equations around the steady state under imposed boundary conditions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : long ] , the static correlation function of concentration fluctuations is expressed in terms of a universal function which describes a shear - induced frustration of the long - range correlation . this function",
    "is numerically evaluated and is compared with asymptotic functions that are analytically derived . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we provide a simple physical interpretation of our results .",
    "we also present rough estimations of the crossover length scales for a realistic fluid to suggest possible experimental verifications .",
    "our conclusion is given in the last section .",
    "the mass diffusion flux @xmath9 generally depends not only on the concentration gradient @xmath10 but also on the temperature gradient @xmath11 and on the pressure gradient @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , when the mass concentration @xmath4 is small , the thermal diffusion ratio is expected to be rather small because it must vanish in a pure liquid @xcite .",
    "we thus can safely neglect the term proportional to @xmath11 , as well as the term proportional to @xmath12 in the expression of @xmath9 because we do not consider any gravity - induced effect . to make the analysis below as simple as possible , we further assume that the mixture is incompressible . consequently , the only relevant hydrodynamic variables are the concentration @xmath4 and the momentum @xmath13 of the mixture .",
    "the equations describing the time evolution of these variables supplemented by the suitable random forces are of the form @xcite @xmath14 where the diffusion flux is given as @xmath15 , and the hydrostatic pressure @xmath16 is determined from the incompressibility condition @xmath17 . here @xmath6 is the mass diffusive coefficient , @xmath18 is the kinematic viscosity of the mixture ( @xmath19 the zero shear viscosity ) . the random forces @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the random concentration flux and the random stress tensor , respectively .",
    "the correlations of these random forces retain their local equilibrium values given by @xcite @xmath22                  \\delta^3({\\bf r}-{\\bf r } ' )                      \\delta(t - t ' ) ,   \\label{fdt - v01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath20 is uncorrelated with @xmath21 . in the following , we assume that the osmotic compressibility @xmath23 and the mass diffusivity @xmath6 are both independent of the concentration @xmath4 , where @xmath24 is the chemical potential of the mixture @xcite . this assumption may be valid when the gradient @xmath25 is not sufficiently large .",
    "we note that the local equilibrium assumption in eqs .",
    "( [ fdt - c01 ] ) and ( [ fdt - v01 ] ) is justified from the fact that the random forces represent the fast , and localized molecular process which can not be affected by the macroscopic gradients of the hydrodynamic quantities .",
    "although we are primarily interested in the bulk fluctuation properties of the mixture , appropriate boundary conditions are required to specify a macroscopic steady state of the averaged thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "we adopt here the standard lees - edwards type boundary conditions @xcite , which can be written explicitly as @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the linear system size of @xmath29 direction that is parallel to both the concentration and shear gradient directions .",
    "it is also assumed that the system is infinitely large in all other directions .",
    "the statistically averaged , time - independent equations ( [ eq - c01 ] ) and ( [ eq - v01 ] ) under the imposed boundary conditions ( [ bc - v ] ) and ( [ bc - c ] ) have solutions @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands for the concentration in the @xmath32 plane . we here chosen our coordinate frame",

    "( [ cf - c03 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath95 we here consider the case where the scattering wave vector @xmath96 is perpendicular to the concentration gradient @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath97 .",

    "as can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ f01 ] ) , the effect of the shear is most likely to become evident in the particular direction of the wave vector given by @xmath84 . to simplify the analysis , we restrict our interest to the fluctuations in this direction . because of this simplification ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior for small @xmath102 limit is easily found to be @xmath103 equation ( [ f - as01 ] ) suggests that the enhancement of the nonequilibrium fluctuations is severely restricted in the long wavelength limit . on the other hand , the opposite asymptotic region , i.e. , the short wavelength limit ,",

    "although the intermediate region given by @xmath121 seems to have @xmath122 dependence , whether it is a true scaling regime or just a crossover is still unclear at present .",
    "note , however , that this region is practically extended in a wide range of the wave numbers , which is typically given as @xmath123 due to the large asymmetry between the magnitude of the viscous and mass diffusivity .",
    "therefore , we expect that this unclearness will be clarified by evaluating @xmath119 for a much smaller @xmath124 than that considered here ( @xmath125 ) , though it can not be done in the present study primarily because of the limitation of the numerical accuracy .",
    "as pointed out in a number of literature , the long - range correlation is originated from the coupling of momentum fluctuations with concentration fluctuations through a macroscopic concentration gradient @xcite .",
    "this is sometimes called a linear mode - coupling effect @xcite . following the discussions given in ref .",
    "@xcite , let us suppose a small fluid element of linear size @xmath126 in the mixture in the absence of the shear .",
    "this fluid portion is carried along the direction of the gradient by a spontaneously generated momentum fluctuation of its lifetime given by @xmath127 . because the surrounding fluid has a different average concentration , the large concentration difference persists for a time @xmath128 as it relaxes purely diffusively . considering that @xmath129",
    ", one can notice that a short - living , spontaneous momentum fluctuation can creates a long - lasting , large - amplitude concentration fluctuation , which results in a long - range spatial correlation between concentration fluctuations in the steady state .",
    "however , shear flow limits the size of such fluctuations significantly , because a sufficiently large fluctuation is drawn out and is even broken up by the shear before it disappears by the diffusion @xcite . in our system ,",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath130 correspond to the crossover length scale from the diffusion - dominated decay to the shear - dominated decay of concentration and momentum fluctuations , respectively . because @xmath105 is much smaller than @xmath130 in practice ,",
    "the overall behavior of @xmath131 is expected to have three distinctive wave number domains .",
    "they can be sketched as follows .",
    "\\(i ) when a small portion of mixture of linear size larger than @xmath130 is carried along the direction of the gradient , it undergoes a significant shear deformation and becomes highly anisotropic . because the lifetime of the concentration fluctuation is controlled by the shortest length scale of its spatial extent , this fluctuation dissipates thermally much faster than that in a quiescent fluid .",
    "thus the long - range correlation between concentration fluctuations is severely suppressed by the shear flow in this wave number region .",
    "\\(ii ) when @xmath132 , a momentum fluctuation can displace a small parcel of fluid of size @xmath126 without a notable shear deformation .",
    "however , if @xmath133 , the shear flow strongly affects the decay of this large - amplitude concentration fluctuation before it dissipates thermally .",
    "then the decay of the fluctuation is still faster than that in a quiescent fluid in this region , and the resulting correlation exhibits a weaker divergent dependence on the wave numbers @xmath1 than @xmath8 .",
    "\\(iii ) when a size of a fluctuation is much smaller than @xmath105 , the effect of the shear becomes rather weak because a thermal diffusive decay is faster than the shear deformation time scale ; @xmath134 .",
    "therefore the usual linear response argument for a quiescent fluid presented in the beginning of this section is fit for this regime .",
    "figure [ fig : c - c corr ] shows that the deviation from the @xmath8 divergence becomes pronounced at the wave number @xmath135 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the presence of @xmath136 is the clear evidence of the shear - induced suppression of the long - range correlation .",
    "although the shear - controlled asymptote is confirmed only in the wave numbers smaller than @xmath137 , it may be impossible to verify this scaling experimentally because the length scale @xmath130 is so macroscopic for relevant fluid parameters and experimentally feasible shear rates @xcite .",
    "( for example , we can obtain @xmath138 mm@xmath139 at most , for a typical value of the viscosity @xmath140 @xmath141s@xmath139 and for a very high rate of the shear that is of the order of @xmath142 s@xmath139 . )",
    "contrary to this situation , a typical value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath143 @xmath141s@xmath139 gives @xmath144 cm@xmath139 even for a very small rate of the shear as @xmath146 s@xmath139 .",
    "therefore , the wave number @xmath136 , which characterizes the onset of the shear - induced frustration of the long - range correlation , is well covered by conventional low - angle light scattering methods , as well as the recently reported new optical technique @xcite .    there have been developed some experimental techniques to produce a macroscopic concentration gradient in a fluid , such as utilizing a diffusive remixing process of a mixture @xcite or making use of a large soret effect driven by a steady temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "although it is far beyond our ability to guess about , the latter method might be more favorable with respect to the compatibility with the shear flow , as well as the spatial uniformity and the temporal stationarity of the concentration gradient .",
    "when the large soret effect is expected , however , we have to take a temperature fluctuation into account as well , because the cross - correlation between concentration and temperature fluctuation makes an important contribution to the rayleigh scattering @xcite . in that case",
    ", the third length scale @xmath147 may enter into the theory , where @xmath148 is the thermal diffusivity of the mixture .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath149 for most of relevant mixtures , @xmath105 is likely to be well separated from the other two length scales .",
    "then , so far as we are concerned with the shear - induced effect , especially with the onset of the crossover , we can expect that the present analysis is applicable to such cases .",
    "in this paper , using fluctuating hydrodynamics , we have studied the fluctuation properties in a ( dilute ) binary mixture with imposed uniform concentration and shear gradients .",
    "it is demonstrated that the static concentration autocorrelation function has the three distinctive wave number regions .",
    "the length scales which characterize the crossovers between different regimes are given as @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "in particular , shear strongly suppresses the @xmath8 divergence for @xmath152 , while the asymptotic shear - controlled behavior is found analytically in the smallest wave numbers satisfying @xmath88 .",
    "it is worth noting that the onset of the shear - induced quench of the long - range correlation may be experimentally observable .",
    "such experimental verification will also become an important test for the applicability of fluctuating hydrodynamics to a fluid in a coupled - nonequilibrium steady state .",

    "<S> a static correlation function of concentration fluctuations in a ( dilute ) binary liquid mixture subjected to both a concentration gradient and uniform shear flow is investigated within the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a well - known @xmath0 long - range correlation at large wave numbers @xmath1 crosses over to a weaker divergent one for wave numbers satisfying @xmath2 , while an asymptotic shear - controlled power - law dependence is confirmed at much smaller wave numbers given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mass concentration , the rate of the shear , the mass diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity of the mixture , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the result will provide for the first time the possibility to observe the shear - induced suppression of a long - range correlation experimentally by using , for example , a low - angle light scattering technique . </S>"
