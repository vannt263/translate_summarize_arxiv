    "particularly interesting are monolayers or thin films of iridium  based materials x@xmath1iro@xmath2 ( x = na or li ) which have been debated to possibly host qsh phase@xcite since both spin orbit coupling ( soc ) and electron  electron interactions are quite strong in such materials .",

    ", one can learn from the effective spin model@xcite ( the strong coupling limit of eq .",

    "that the magnetization lies in the @xmath25 plane .",
    "hence we chose the order parameter accordingly , @xmath26 . from the hubbard interaction",
    "we obtain @xmath27 . a standard mf decomposition results in @xmath28 where the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 are associated with the two sublattices .",

    "the transition line differs slightly from the analog calculation with the order parameter @xmath34 .",
    "mainly , the form of @xmath35 reveals that the mean field approximation causes another mass term which does not compete with the soc mass @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , when passing from the tbi to the sdw phase we do not expect closing of the single particle gap .",
    "indeed , within cdmft no closing of the single particle gap is observed ( while the gap has a local minimum at the transition ) .",

    "magnetic , exhibits a finite spin gap , and is separated from the tbi phase by closing of the single  particle gap ( see fig.[fig : temp ] ) .",
    "this phase is reminiscent of the recently found quantum spin liquid ( sl ) phase@xcite , in particular , position and shape of this non  magnetic insulator phase essentially coincides with the sl phase found within qmc@xcite . here , we shall mention that since the cdmft method approximates the self  energy by restricting it to the chosen cluster ( see inset of fig.[fig : phase ] ) , the correlation length of this sl phase can not be inferred .",

    "the blue line is a linear fit . ]    in the phase diagram of fig.[fig : phase ] there is an additional semi  metal ( sm ) phase where the dirac cones of graphene are preserved . using qmc as impurity solver , we systematically discuss temperature effects at weak soc .",
    "we observe that the sl phase appears at very low temperatures ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and that the sm domain prominently develops with temperature as the tbi gap is also very small when @xmath45 . for @xmath5",
    ", the sm phase reduces to a line pointing along the @xmath23 axis which survives until relatively large interactions . from renormalization group point of view",
    ", this sm line at @xmath23 is known to be stable for weak @xmath14@xcite .",
    "hence , we show the sm region for @xmath39 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 in fig.[fig : phase ] . remember that both the sl and tbi phases at @xmath46 possess a small single - particle gap . in the inset of fig.[fig : temp ] we present the single particle gap and magnetization for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the evolution of the phase diagram with temperature is shown in fig.[fig : temp ] for @xmath38 .",
    "we are using continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) as an impurity solver which enables us to access finite temperatures .",
    "this is clearly an advantage of the method since experiments are performed at finite temperatures but a careful interpretation of results is still needed . in fig.[fig : temp ] , for instance , the sdw phase at finite @xmath47 violating mermin - wagner theorem is clearly an artifact of the cdmft method .",
    "in contrast , the stability of the tbi phase with increasing temperature is reliable and important for experimentalists . from an experimental perspective , it may be interesting to know how @xmath48 can be raised and for what parameter settings @xmath48 is conveniently large . since the spin orbit gap for @xmath38 is tiny , @xmath49",
    ". increasing @xmath13 ( and the bulk gap ) , however , leads to an ( approximately linear ) increase of @xmath48 up to @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath44 ; see fig.[fig : tc - tbi ] where the line is a linear fit .",
