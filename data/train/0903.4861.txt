    "quasars and other types of agn activity are believed to be powered by supermassive black holes .",
    "the agn activity may produce highly collimated outflows from the immediate vicinity of the black hole ( e.g. rees 1984 ; blandford 1990 ) , which can power a large - scale radio source . two defining properties of astrophysical black holes that can be measured in principle are the black hole mass and spin . a significant amount of progress has been made toward measuring the masses of supermassive black holes ( e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",

    "general theoretical studies suggest that the merger and accretion history of a supermassive black hole is encoded in the spin of the hole .",
    "for example , successive mergers are likely to produce black holes that are spinning at a moderate rate ( @xmath1 ) , while powerful accretion events are likely to produce rapidly rotating black holes ( berti & volonteri 2008 ) .",
    "alternatively , most black holes may grow due to many short - lived , uncorrelated accretion episodes , which would lead to lower spin values ( king & pringle 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "numerous uncorrelated accretion episodes tend to cause the spin of the hole to decrease over time with substantial fluctuations in spin caused by each episode ( king , pringle , & hofmann 2008 ) .    at present , only a few observations allow black hole spins to be studied directly",

    ", daly ( 2009 ) showed that the outflow energy and the black hole mass may be combined to obtain a lower limit on the spin of the black hole . for a sample of 19 very powerful classical double sources , the lower bound was about the same for each source in the sample , and indicated @xmath2 .    here",
    ", beam powers and black hole masses of radio sources are combined to study black hole spins in the contexts of the models of blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) , meier ( 1999 ) , and models with similar functional forms .",
    "it is shown that the spin and magnetic field strength of a supermassive black hole can be rather tightly constrained in the contexts of these models .",
    "the method is described in section 2 .",
    "it is applied to two samples of sources , and the results are presented in section 3 , discussed in section 4 , and summarized in section 5 . a standard cosmological model with @xmath3 km / s / mpc , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and zero space curvature is assumed throughout .",
    "the well - known model of blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) , referred to as the bz model , and other models to power highly collimated outflows from agn are considered here . in the bz model , the beam power @xmath6 that will be produced is related to the dimensionless black hole spin @xmath7 , the black hole horizon @xmath8 , and the poloidal magnetic field strength @xmath9 at the horizon , where @xmath10 is the black hole spin angular momentum , m is the black hole mass , g is newton s constant , and c is the speed of light ( e.g. macdonald & thorne 1982 ; thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ) @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the value of @xmath9 in units of @xmath13 g , @xmath14 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath15 , and the factor @xmath16 depends on the angular velocity of the field lines @xmath17 relative to that of the hole @xmath18 and is taken to have its maximum value of @xmath19 ( e.g. blandford 1990 ) .",
    "the magnetic field strength is not expected to exceed the eddington magnetic field strength , given by @xmath20 g ( e.g. dermer , finke , & menon 2008 ) . rewriting equation ( 1 ) in terms of the black hole spin @xmath21 and normalized magnetic field strength @xmath22",
    ", we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the eddington magnetic field strength in units of @xmath13 g , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the beam power in units of @xmath27 erg / s , and @xmath28 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath29 erg / s .    equation ( 2 ) allows a determination of the quantity @xmath30 when observations allow determinations of the beam power of the source , @xmath6 , and the black hole mass , @xmath31 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 provides a lower bound on @xmath21 and a lower bound on @xmath32 in the context of the bz model since the maximum value of @xmath21 is unity and the maximum value of @xmath32 is unity .",
    "when this parameter , referred to as the `` j - b '' parameter , is equal to one , it suggests that both @xmath21 and @xmath32 are close to one .",
    "if the `` j - b '' parameter exceeds one , it suggests a problem with the underlying model ( in this case , the bz model ) .",
    "thus , the `` j - b '' parameter indicated by equation ( 2 ) provides a lower bound on @xmath21 and a lower bound on @xmath32 in the context of the bz model , and provides a test of the bz model .",
    "models may be characterized by comparison with bz model predictions by writing @xmath33 .",

    "this model includes characteristics of the blandford - payne ( blandford & payne 1982 ) and blandford - znajek ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) models .",
    "the beam power produced in this model is @xmath38 erg / s ( meier 1999 ) , or @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .    requiring that @xmath34 satisfy @xmath41 allows constraints to be placed on @xmath36 , and this indicates which models can account for the characteristics of these systems .",
    "the method is applied to the samples of 19 very powerful frii radio galaxies ( referred to as friib sources ) and 29 central dominant galaxies ( cdgs ) studied by daly ( 2009 ) .",
    "the friib sources have radio powers at least a factor of ten above the classical fri / frii transition ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) .",
    "black hole masses and beam powers are available for all of these sources ; the masses are listed in tables 1 and 2 of daly ( 2009 ) . beam powers for the powerful classical double radio galaxies are obtained from guerra et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , wan , daly , & guerra ( 2000 ) , and odea et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ; note that these beam powers are independent of offsets of the extended radio source from minimum energy conditions ( odea et al .",
    "beam powers for the cdgs are obtained from rafferty et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and also are independent of offsets from minimum energy conditions .",
    "almost all of the radio sources associated with cdgs have fri radio source structure or amorphous radio structure , with a few exceptions such as cygnus a ( birzan et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the name , redshift , total beam power , black hole mass , and eddington magnetic field strength are listed for each source in tables 1 and 2 for the friib and cdg sources , respectively .",
    "the beam powers and black hole masses were combined to solve for @xmath30 using equation ( 2 ) and are listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "values of @xmath42 were obtained explicitly for the friib sources using @xmath43 so @xmath44 , and are included in table 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is listed in the final column of tables 1 and 2 , and is discussed below . for simplicity , the average values of asymmetric error bars was used .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is shown as a function of black hole mass in figure 1 . analyzing the two samples separately ,",
    "there is no indication of a dependence of @xmath30 on black hole mass ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "since @xmath30 , and @xmath42 , are proportional to @xmath46 ( see eq .",
    "2 ) , this is equivalent to finding no dependence of @xmath47 on black hole mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is shown as a function of redshift in figure 2 .",
    "each sample clearly exhibits a dependence of @xmath34 on redshift ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the sample of 19 powerful friib sources has the dependence @xmath48 .",
    "given that these are the most powerful radio sources at each redshift and that they are drawn from a complete sample of sources , this represents the envelope of the distribution of @xmath34 values as a function of redshift .",
    "thus , this redshift dependence can be interpreted as the evolution of the maximum value of @xmath34 as a function of redshift , and is obtained in the context of the bz model .",
    "the normalization of @xmath34 decreases by a factor of about @xmath49 if the meier model is considered , but the redshift behavior is unaffected .",
    "the beam power is shown as a function of black hole mass in figure 3 .",
    "the cdgs have much lower beam powers than the friib sources , though the sources are powered by black holes with similar mass .",
    "the value of @xmath21 and @xmath32 may be independent , or the value of @xmath32 could depend upon @xmath21 .",
    "the results of daly et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and daly & guerra ( 2002 ) suggest that @xmath50 , that is , @xmath51 . setting @xmath52 , and noting that @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the results for @xmath34 listed in table 1 indicate that @xmath55 for the bz model .",
    "thus , @xmath56 is of order unity , or @xmath57 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath58 , and the redshift evolution of the maximum value of @xmath21 varies as @xmath59 .",
    "the values of @xmath21 obtained using @xmath60 are listed in the final column of tables 1 and 2 and are obtained in the context of the bz model .",
    "all of the empirically determined @xmath30 parameters are consistent with @xmath61 at about the 1 sigma level , thus the current data do not require modifications to the bz model ( see tables 1 and 2 and figure 1 ) .",
    "it is interesting that many sources have @xmath62 , indicating that both @xmath21 and @xmath32 are close to one if the bz model provides an accurate description of the physics of these systems .",
    "almost all of the empirically determined @xmath63 parameters are less than one , indicating that either @xmath21 or @xmath32 is less than one if this model provides an accurate description of these systems .",
    "as noted in section [ method ] , the parameter @xmath34 provides a lower bound on @xmath21 and a lower bound on @xmath32 since neither is expected to exceed unity . the lower bounds on @xmath21 obtained for friib sources in the bz and the meier models are about 0.4 and 0.2 , respectively ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these are larger than the lower bound of @xmath64 obtained for these same sources by daly ( 2009 ) using a model - independent approach , assuming only that the large - scale outflow from the agn is powered by the spin energy of the black hole . combining the results obtained here with those obtained by daly ( 2009 )",
    "indicates that only a small fraction of the spin energy per unit black hole mass , @xmath65 , of a system is extracted during one particular outflow event for the friib sources studied and most of the cdgs .",
    "thus , a single outflow event does not significantly reduce the spin of the black hole for friib sources and most radio sources associated with cdgs .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is clearly increasing with redshift ( see figure 2 ) , and is roughly @xmath66 for the friib sources .",
    "the fact that lower @xmath30 sources are missing at high redshift results from the radio power selection effect , since all of the higher redshift sources are from the 3crr catalog ( laing , riley , & longair 1983 ) ; obviously , this does not explain the lack of high @xmath34 sources at low redshift .",
    "given that the sources with high radio power have high beam power , and , for a fixed black hole mass , sources with high beam power have high spin ( see eq .",
    "1 ) , the friib sources studied here are likely to have spin values that are close to the maximal values for sources at that redshift .",
    "thus , the evolution of spin of these systems should be considered to be the envelope of the distribution , presenting the maximal spin as a function of redshift .",
    "that is , the black holes at the centers of massive elliptical galaxies that produce friib radio sources have maximal spin values that are slowly decreasing as the universe evolves .",
    "the results of daly ( 2009 ) suggest that the energy extracted per unit black hole mass , @xmath65 , during each outflow event is independent of source redshift and black hole mass , and is roughly constant for all of the friib sources studied .",
    "given the selection effects affecting the cdgs , the data were consistent with those sources having a value of @xmath67 similar to that of the friib sources .",
    "the lower bounds on @xmath21 obtained here in the context of the bz model are consistent with @xmath67 of @xmath68 obtained for the friib sources by daly ( 2009 ) and with most of the cdgs at about 1 to 2 @xmath69 .    in the case that @xmath70 , as discussed in section [ results ] and as indicated by detailed studies of friib sources ( e.g. daly et al .",
    "2009 ) , the value of @xmath21 is obtained by taking the square root of the values of @xmath34 listed in tables 1 and 2 , and is listed in the final columns of each table . in this case , all of the friib and cdg sources have values of @xmath21 that are consistent with the `` model - independent '' minimum value @xmath64 obtained by daly ( 2009 ) . in addition , this implies that the maximum value of @xmath21 evolves as @xmath71 .",
    "the evolution of the spins of supermassive black holes may be used to study the accretion and merger history of these sources , as discussed , for example , by king & pringle ( 2006 , 2007 ) , berti & volonteri ( 2008 ) , and king , pringle , and hofmann ( 2008 ) .",
    "it is particularly intriguing that the redshift evolution obtained here for friib sources is very similar to that predicted by the detailed model of king , pringle , & hofmann ( 2008 ) for spin down by gas accretion through a series of repeated accretion episodes .",
    "in comparing the results obtained here with theoretical predictions , it should be kept in mind that all of the cdgs are by definition associated with giant elliptical galaxies , and the friib sources are likely to evolve into cdgs ( lilly & longair 1984 ; best et al .",
    "1998 ; mclure et al .",
    "2004 ) . due to the way each sample",
    "is selected , the cdgs allow a glimpse into the spin values of sources with low radio power and low beam power , while the friib sources are the most powerful extended radio sources at their respective redshifts .",
    "the combination of the results obtained here with those obtained earlier suggest that each source may undergo multiple outflow events .",
    "the energy extracted per outflow event is roughly constant , suggesting very similar physical conditions in the source when the outflow event is triggered , and the energy extracted per outflow event is a small fraction of the total available energy for most of the sources ( daly 2009 ) .",
    "thus , each source may undergo numerous outflow events .",
    "these outflow events could significantly affect the gaseous medium in the vicinity of the radio source .",
    "this heating of the gaseous environment of the source could cause the radio source structure to shift from frii to fri structure .",
    "this is consistent with the ideas that very powerful 3crr radio galaxies evolve into cdgs ( lilly & longair 1984 ; best et al .",
    "1998 ; mclure et al .",
    "2004 ) , that different radio structures are determined by the source environment ( e.g. hardee et al . 1992",
    "; odonoghue , eilek , & owen 1993 ; burns et al .",
    "1994 ; bicknell 1995 ; barai & wiita 2007 ) , and that the evolution of the gaseous environments could be due in part to the large - scale outflows ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; eilek & owen 2002 ) .",
    "the cdgs do have much lower beam powers than the friib sources , which may also explain the differences in the radio source structures .",
    "both the cdg and friib samples are illustrative of outflows from massive black holes associated with giant elliptical galaxies since friib sources are expected to evolve into cdgs ( lilly & longair 1984 ; best et al .",
    "1998 ; mclure et al .",
    "the cdgs allow a study of black hole spins and magnetic field strengths of lower power radio sources that have a range of beam power , black hole spin , and magnetic field strengths .",
    "the friib sources allow a study of black hole spins and magnetic field strengths of the most powerful sources with large - scale outflows at their respective redshifts ; these are the sources that have the largest radio power , beam power , and black hole spin .",
    "these sources were studied in the context of the bz and meier models , which allowed the beam power and black hole mass of each source to be combined to obtain lower bounds on the black hole spin and strength of the magnetic field close to the black hole .",
    "the lower bounds on the black hole spin obtained for friib sources were significantly larger than those obtained by daly ( 2009 ) by studying the outflow energy and black hole mass of each system .",
    "this implies that , if the black hole spin powers the large - scale outflows in these systems , then the energy extracted in each outflow event is a small fraction of the total spin energy available .",
    "thus , the evolution of the spin with redshift is a reflection of the merger and accretion history of the source , and is not significantly affected by energy losses associated with the outflow . and , each source may undergo numerous outflow events .",
    "independent empirical work has shown that the magnetic field strength is proportional to the black hole spin ( e.g. daly et al .",
    "this means that the values of @xmath34 obtained here can be used to obtain estimates of the black hole spin @xmath21 ; the normalization between @xmath32 and @xmath21 is of order unity , but is not precisely known .",
    "values of @xmath21 were obtained in the context of the bz model for the friib and cdgs .",
    "the values obtained for friib sources range from about 0.7 to 1 , while those for cdgs range from about 0.14 to 0.8 .",
    "if considered in the context of the meier ( 1999 ) model , these values decrease by a factor of about 1.5 .",
    "all of the values are greater than or similar to the `` model - independent '' minimum value of @xmath72 obtained by daly ( 2009 ) .",
    "losses due to outflows will affect the spin of the black hole when that spin is close to @xmath67 .",
    "thus , this could affect the spins of black holes of cdgs with low values of @xmath21 , but is unlikely to affect the those associated with friib sources .",

    "<S> this is done in the context of the models of blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) ( the bz model ) and meier ( 1999 ) ; a parameterization for bounds in the context of other models is suggested . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds obtained for very powerful classical double radio sources in the bz model are consistent with black hole spins of order unity for sources at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the black hole spins are largest for the highest redshift sources and decrease for sources at lower redshift ; the sources studied have redshifts between zero and two . </S>",
    "<S> lower power radio sources associated with central dominant galaxies may have black hole spins that are significantly less than one . combining </S>",
    "<S> this analysis with other results suggests that the maximum values of black hole spin associated with powerful radio galaxies decline from values of order unity at a redshift of 2 to values of order 0.7 at a redshift of zero , falling roughly as @xmath0 , while lower power radio sources have spin values that range from about 0.1 to 0.8 . </S>",
    "<S> these black hole spin values decrease if the data are considered in the context of the meier model rather than the bz model . </S>"
