    "the yang - mills field is one of the central objects in particle physics . when we discuss a unification of fundamental interactions , non - abelian gauge fields , which are a generalization of the yang - mills field , play a key role .",

    "the yang - mills field may also be homogeneously distributed by some symmetry - breaking mechanism .",
    "so far , there has not been much study of the homogeneous yang - mills field in the context of cosmology .",
    "in fact , the homogeneous source - free yang - mills field has been studied in the hope that a non - perturbative treatment may allow a better understanding of the vacuum state of the yang - mills field , despite the fact that strong and weak interactions have no classical counterpart .",
    "it is also interesting to study the yang - mills field from the viewpoint of a dynamical system because it shows chaotic behaviors in minkowski spacetime @xcite ( see also a good review @xcite ) .",
    "the homogeneous yang - mills field evolves as a particle in some potential . a particle in such a potential ( see fig .",
    "[ graph : potential ] for the potential shape ) is known to show chaotic behavior by the study of a billiard system .",

    "which spacetime shows the chaotic behavior of the yang - mills field ?",
    "is chaos a universal phenomenon in generic spacetimes ? with these questions in mind , we search the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) system for more generic bianchi type spacetimes @xcite .",
    "we should also stress another important point in the present system .",
    "we know that the past asymptotic behavior toward the initial singularity of vacuum bianchi viii and ix spacetimes is chaotic @xcite .",
    "they are called the mixmaster universe @xcite .",
    "the other type bianchi spacetimes with a perfect fluid do not show chaotic behavior .",
    "for example , a bianchi i spacetime with a perfect fluid approaches monotonously the kasner spacetime , which is a shear dominant universe . the inclusion of a magnetic field , however , makes the dynamics very complicated .",
    "bianchi i ,",
    "ii , vi@xmath0 spacetimes with a perfect fluid and a homogeneous source - free magnetic field behave like a mixmaster universe @xcite .",
    "we should then study whether the past asymptotic behavior of bianchi spacetimes with the yang - mills field shows similar chaotic behavior .",
    "we also mention the bkl ( belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ) conjecture , which predicts a fate of singularities in general inhomogeneous spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the bkl conjecture naively says that any spatially different points decouple each other near initial singularity .",
    "strictly speaking , it consists of the following three statements : + first , a spacetime near singularity becomes spatially homogeneous at each spacetime point , which can be described explicitly by using a suitable local coordinate system .",
    "+ secondly , the contribution of a matter to the system becomes negligible near singularity compared with those of shear and curvature terms , although the matter energy density may blow up into initial singularity .",
    "this asymptotic spacetime is given by a vacuum bianchi model .",
    "this is why vacuum models are often studied .",
    "+ thirdly , the most generic spatially homogeneous models near singularity is bianchi ix spacetime . these statements , then , yields that a spacetime near initial singularity should be described by the mixmaster universe . now let us look back at the case of bianchi i , ii , vi@xmath0 model with magnetic field @xcite . in their cases , the energy density of magnetic field , which is normalized by a hubble expansion parameter , does not vanish toward a singularity .",
    "it sometimes shows a spiky growth like a curvature term in the mixmaster universe .",
    "this breaks the second statement of the bkl conjecture .",
    "hence , such a model may be regarded as a counterexample to the bkl conjecture .",
    "it is interesting to study whether bianchi i ( or more generically bianchi ix ) spacetime with the yang - mills field also give a counterexample to the bkl conjecture .",
    "a natural question arises in the case of bianchi ix spacetime : does a combination of two types of chaos , that is chaos with the yang - mills field and chaos in the bianchi ix spacetime , strengthen each chaotic behavior ?",
    "we now proceed to analyze the yang - mills field in the bianchi ix spacetime .",
    "finally , it should be noted that it is difficult to discuss chaos in general relativity .",
    "many standard indicators of chaos , such as the lyapunov exponent , depend on the choice of coordinate systems . in order to define chaos independently from the coordinate choice ,",
    "many efforts have been done so far .",
    "a fractal basin approach is well known for the coordinate independent indicator of chaos @xcite . using the lyapunov exponent , recently ,",
    "a coordinate independent definition of chaos has also been proposed @xcite . in this paper",

    "therefore , in what follows , we discuss only the class a bianchi spacetimes .    in order to discuss the dynamics , it is also convenient to introduce the hubble normalized variables , which are defined as follows : @xmath42    we also introduce the conventional shear variables of the bianchi spacetime as @xmath43 the diagonal components of the yang - mills field potential are described by new variables @xmath44 as @xmath45 a new time variable @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 is introduced .",

    "<S> , the yang - mills field behaves as that in minkowski spacetime , in which we can understand it by a potential picture , except for the types viii and ix . at the same time , in the initial phase ( near the initial singularity ) , we numerically find that the behavior seems to approach the kasner solution . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that the kasner circle is unstable and the kasner solution is not an attractor . from an analysis of stability and numerical simulation , we find a mixmaster - like behavior in bianchi i spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> although this result may provide a counterexample to the bkl ( belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ) conjecture , we show that the bkl conjecture is still valid in bianchi ix spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze a multiplicative effect of two types of chaos , that is , chaos with the yang - mills field and that in vacuum bianchi ix spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> two types of chaos seem to coexist in the initial phase . </S>",
