    "over the last decade , outstanding progress in microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) technologies and semi - conductor lasers , combined to coherent population trapping ( cpt ) physics @xcite , has allowed the development of high - performance miniature atomic clocks ( mac ) that combine a volume of about 15 @xmath8 , a total power consumption lower than 150 mw and a fractional frequency stability lower than 10@xmath9 at 1 hour and 1 day integration time @xcite .",
    "such frequency references , now commercially - available @xcite , can provide the base for a number of mobile and embedded applications including network synchronization , new - generation mobile telecommunication systems , satellite - based navigation systems on - earth receivers , secure banking data transfer or military and avionic systems . in a cs atom - based mac ,",
    "a 4.596  ghz local oscillator ( lo ) , ultimately frequency - stabilized onto the atomic clock transition frequency , is required to drive a vertical - cavity - surface - emitting laser ( vcsel ) .",
    "this local oscillator needs to satisfy numerous stringent requirements .",
    "it must be integrated onto a reduced surface footprint ( @xmath10 1 cm@xmath3 ) , consume a negligible maximum power of about 50 mw for battery - powered applications , deliver an output microwave power tunable between @xmath12 and a few dbm @xcite to drive the vcsel laser and be compatible with low - cost mass production .",
    "the lo output frequency must be tunable with a high resolution so that the relative frequency error remains significantly smaller than the targeted clock stability .",
    "in general , a frequency resolution at the mhz level is desired to ensure a frequency stability below 10@xmath13 .",
    "additionally , the output 4.596  ghz signal must be modulated in frequency with a rate and a depth of about 1  khz in order to be used in a lock - in amplifier configuration . moreover , phase noise is critical because the short term frequency stability of a passive atomic frequency standard can be degraded by the lo phase noise through an intermodulation effect @xcite .",
    "the fractional frequency stability limitation @xmath14 of the atomic clock due to this aliasing effect can be approximated by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the power spectral density ( psd ) of the lo phase fluctuations in the free - running regime at fourier frequency @xmath17 and @xmath18 the averaging time . according to this relation , assuming a lo modulation frequency @xmath19 of 1  khz and targeting @xmath20 @xmath10 2 @xmath5 10@xmath9 at 1 s integration time",
    ", we calculate that @xmath21 must be lower than @xmath22  dbrad@xmath3/hz .",
    "the most common technological approach for the development of a lo in mac application , using discrete components , consists of a frequency synthesizer using a lc voltage - controlled oscillator ( vco ) phase - locked to a 10 mhz quartz oscillator through a fractional - n phase - locked loop ( pll ) . in @xcite , a 4.596-ghz synthesizer was built reaching a power consumption of 40 mw and giving a clock short - term stability of @xmath23 , limited by the rf synthesizer phase noise . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a 12-mw single - chip 4.596  ghz frequency synthesizer asic implemented in a 130-nm rf cmos process was developed for a cs mac , demonstrating a clock stability of @xmath24 at 1 s , limited by the signal - to - noise ratio of the detected cpt signal .",
    "however , in such systems , the frequency multiplication degrades the phase noise and can consume up to 50 % of the mac total power budget @xcite . in an another way , brannon et al . developed for mac applications microwave oscillators based on quarter - wavelength ceramic - filled coaxial resonators .",
    "nevertheless , these sources exhibited modest phase noise performances of @xmath25  dbrad@xmath3/hz and @xmath26  dbrad@xmath3/hz at 1  khz and 10  khz from the carrier respectively @xcite .",
    "a promising alternative solution for mac applications is the development of microwave mems oscillators based on bulk acoustic wave resonators ( baw ) .",
    "these resonators exhibit an extremely small size and power consumption , very high q@xmath5f products up to 10@xmath27 @xcite and high - potential for wafer - level fabrication . in this domain ,",
    "high - overtone bulk acoustic resonators ( hbar ) have emerged as a valuable tradeoff between thin - film bulk acoustic resonators ( fbar )  reaching the microwave frequency range but requiring a thin and fragile membrane to be fabricated  and surface acoustic wave ( saw ) resonators that benefit from a mature technology level , advanced design tools , simpler manufacturing steps compared to thin - film - based devices but whose operating frequency is limited by lithography resolution .",
    "numerous hbar - based oscillators have been developed ( see for example @xcite ) . however , because of the difficulty to tune the lo frequency to the exact atomic transition frequency , we found a unique example in the literature of a hbar - based oscillator frequency - locked to a cpt resonance . in 2009 , yu et al . demonstrated a hbar - based 3.6  ghz pierce oscillator with a phase noise of @xmath22  dbrad@xmath3/hz at 1  khz fourier frequency , a power consumption of 3.2 mw ,",
    "a frequency stability of 1.5 @xmath5 10@xmath6 at 1 second @xcite in free - running regime and claimed to be improved at the level of 1 @xmath5 10@xmath28 when locked to a cm - scale rb vapor cell .  note that in this reference , the output signal of the hbar oscillator was mixed with a rf signal from an external synthesizer , highlighting the difficulty to tune the output frequency to the exact atomic transition frequency .",
    "moreover , a vapor cell with cm - scale dimensions was used in the cpt experiment .",
    "also , no figures were reported on the cpt clock experiment in this article .",
    "this article reports on an original double - port aln / sapphire 2.298  ghz hbar - oscillator - based 4.596  ghz frequency synthesizer used as a local oscillator in a cs vapor - microcell based cpt atomic clock .",
    "while not fully - integrated , the system architecture presented in this work is found to be well suitable for mac applications with high potential for miniaturization and low power consumption .",
    "dedicated design rules , `` juggling '' with the resonator dimensions , materials , temperature sensitivity and multi - mode spectrum specificity of hbar , are provided for the resonator to be best suited to this application and to ensure the output frequency to be resonant with cs atom at 4.596  ghz .",
    "section [ sec : hbar ] describes the resonator .",
    "section [ sec : hbarosc ] describes the hbar - based 2.298  ghz oscillator and 4.596  ghz frequency synthesizer .",
    "section [ sec : cpt ] details the cpt experiment using the hbar - based frequency source .",
    "an hbar is obtained by stacking a thin piezoelectric film over a low - acoustic loss substrate .",
    "the thin piezoelectric film generates an acoustic wave by converting an incoming exciting electrical signal , while the thick substrate confines the acoustic energy , allowing for high quality factor .",
    "this coupled resonant structure yields a complex multimode spectrum in which a broad envelope , defined by the thin film resonance frequency and its overtones , modulates the admittance real part maximum of a comb of modes equally spaced by a frequency splitting defined by the inverse of the substrate thickness .",
    "figure [ fig : hbar_sch ] shows the architecture of the hbar resonator .",
    "the approach , inspired by @xcite , is to build two single - port hbar resonators close enough one another in order to promote acoustic coupling via evanescent waves by proper selection of material combinations .",
    "the bottom electrode is shared by the two resonators and is accessed through dedicated vias connected to ground .",
    "typical losses are in the 15 to 20  db range , with a rejection better than 15  db .",
    "this double - port resonator configuration is of great interest to simplify the development of an oscillator . unlike the negative resistance clapp ,",
    "pierce or colpitts oscillators which use the anti - resonance of single - port resonators , dual - port resonator oscillators allow a rational approach of barkhausen conditions . additionally , the double - port configuration is less sensitive to parasitic electrical elements than standard oscillator architectures ( colpitts , clapp or pierce ) .",
    "five degrees of freedom are available when designing an hbar : piezoelectric thin film and low acoustic loss substrate material properties , thicknesses , and electrode geometry .",
    "the piezoelectric substrate is selected with a high coupling coefficient for each mode to be well defined , since each piezoelectric layer overtone spreads its coupling coefficient over all the modes of the comb included in each envelope . here",
    "a thin film of aluminum nitride ( aln ) is deposited under vacuum .",
    "the low - acoustic loss substrate defines each mode @xmath29-factor : the lower the losses , the better the quality factor . here",
    ", sapphire is selected for its excellent properties in the microwave frequency range @xcite .",
    "the resonance frequency @xmath30 of the piezoelectric film fundamental mode is fixed by the ratio @xmath31 with @xmath32 the longitudinal wave velocity in the piezo electric substrate and @xmath33 the piezoelectric film thickness . here",
    ", considering the addition of mo electrodes a longitudinal wave velocity @xmath32 of 11  270 m / s in aln and a reached thickness @xmath33 of about 1  @xmath34 m , the frequency of the fundamental mode is @xmath35  ghz .",
    "consequently , the second overtone is used to reach the frequency of @xmath36  ghz , close to the quarter of the cs clock frequency ( 2.298  ghz ) .",
    "the choice of the substrate thickness , that defines the spacing between adjacent modes , results from several key points . on the one hand , the thinner the substrate , the wider the spacing and the easier the oscillator design for selecting the targeted mode , but the more fragile the resonator . obviously , without any other freedom degrees such as the resonator temperature , an excellent manufacturing resolution on the substrate thickness would be required in order to tune finely the resonator frequency to the exact atomic transition frequency . in a miniature cs vapor cell clock",
    ", the cpt resonance linewidth ranges from a few khz to 20 khz .",
    "this order of magnitude determines the required resolution @xmath37 on the hbar resonance position accuracy .",
    "let us assume a targeted operation frequency of about 4  ghz and a mode spacing of about 10  mhz as justified later .",
    "the overtone number would be @xmath38 .",
    "assuming that the piezoelectric layer acts as an acoustic energy pump and that the mode frequency is governed by the substrate , the uncertainty @xmath39 on the substrate thickness @xmath40 is given by : @xmath41 with @xmath42  m / s the acoustic wave velocity in the substrate .",
    "we calculate that reaching a frequency uncertainty @xmath37 below 20  khz requires a control of the substrate thickness such as @xmath43  nm , that is not achievable with our technology .",
    "therefore we decided to adopt a two - step tuning strategy of the hbar - based oscillator to ensure the output signal to be resonant with cs atoms .",
    "a first coarse frequency tuning is reached by exploiting the frequency - temperature dependence of the hbar .",
    "a second fine frequency tuning over a few tens of khz is achieved by tuning the bias point of a voltage controlled phase shifter ( vcps ) in the oscillator loop ( see section [ sec : hbarosc ] ) .",
    "the latter tuning capability must be used cautiously since the multi - mode nature of the resonator induces frequency jumps if the vcps bias point is changed so that an adjacent mode is favored .",

    "are highlighted .",
    "a 100-mhz wide bandpass surface acoustic wave ( saw ) filter ( golledge ta0700a ) of central frequency 2.25  ghz is used for primary modal selection . in the filter bandwidth , about ten modes of the resonator response are selected and can be used for oscillation .",

    "the temperature sensitivity of @xmath51  khz/@xmath50c helps to define here the substrate thickness . considering that we wish to keep the resonator below a temperature of 220@xmath0c , the temperature span from room temperature to the maximum operating temperature is about 200  @xmath50c .",

    "this measured short - term frequency stability , better than those reported in @xcite , is for @xmath18 up to 100  s well below the typical short - term stability specification of @xmath81 @xmath80 required in miniature atomic clocks .",
    "after 5  s , the clock frequency stability was found to be limited by laser power effects . at 100",
    "s , the stabilization of the hbar - oscillator to the atomic transition frequency allows to improve further its frequency stability by about 600 to reach the level of @xmath82 . for comparison ,",
    "a frequency stability test was performed by using as local oscillator a laboratory - prototype microwave synthesizer ( rs smb100a ) driven by a 10 mhz quartz oscillator .",
    "it is observed in this case that the short - term fractional frequency stability of the clock is recorded at the level of 5 @xmath5 10@xmath9 @xmath80 up 5  s. nevertheless , the observed difference between the two stability curves ( hbar - based source and laboratory - type synthesizer ) are within the measurement errors and can be attributed to different loop settings .",
    "these results show that the performance of the hbar - based oscillator is well suited for realizing miniature atomic clocks with excellent frequency stabilities .    c. the cs - ne microcell temperature is 84@xmath0c .",

    "the work presented in this article is an original approach for the development of hbar - sources dedicated to be used as local oscillators in macs .",
    "initially , tuning finely the output frequency of a hbar resonator is not obvious due to the difficulty to control accurately thicknesses of materials during the fabrication process .",
    "additionally , hbars currently exhibit a high temperature coefficient of frequency of 10 to 20 ppm/@xmath50c .",
    "techniques to reduce the hbar temperature sensitivity exist @xcite but often at the expense of a degradation of the q - factor and supplemental technological steps bringing increased complexity .",
    "eventually , an inherent characteristic of hbar is their multi - mode spectrum that complicates their use in an oscillator and forces one to filter the response to select a single resonance . in this article",
    ", we tried to convert these drawbacks into strong key points to adapt the hbar to mac applications .",
    "the high - temperature sensitivity is an advantage for coarse tuning of the hbar frequency and hence compensate for unreachable thickness resolutions for reaching the cs transition frequency .",
    "moreover , the fine tuning of the hbar oscillator frequency with a voltage - controlled phase shifter in the loop prevents the use of a high - power consuming direct digital synthesizer . in our system ,",
    "the voltage - to - frequency tuning with the vcps was about 8  khz / v .",
    "then , a supply voltage with a resolution of 1 @xmath34v allows a satisfying frequency resolution of 8 mhz .",
    "while no integration and packaging efforts were done in this work , related activities demonstrate that this strategy is compatible with low volume and low power consumption requirements for mac applications . in terms of compacity ,",
    "the dimensions of the hbar are driven by the electrode area and the total material stack thickness .",
    "the acoustic energy confinement in the substrate requires electrodes dimensions `` very '' large with respect to the acoustic wavelength .",
    "operating above 2  ghz induces wavelengths lower than 6  @xmath34 m and a 1@xmath51  mm large hbar transducer meets the acoustic energy confinement conditions .",
    "hence , hbar meets clearly the compact resonator requirement .",
    "the dimensions of the oscillator circuit have not been considered in this investigation but have been demonstrated at the integrated chip level in the literature @xcite .",
    "the power consumption of the hbar - local oscillator is mainly driven by the microwave sustaining amplifier and the resonator thermal control .",
    "the power consumption of the vcps ( capacitive load polarized with a dc voltage ) is negligible . in our system , the main contribution to the consumption budget is the hbar temperature control circuit with over 900  mw needed to heat the packaged hbar .",
    "such a power consumption is not acceptable for embedded applications . the best way to reduce such",
    "a large current would be to confine the heating to the bare resonator rather than the whole packaged device .",
    "ideally , the temperature set point of the hbar should be fixed at about 85 ",
    "90@xmath0c to support a mac operation typical temperature range of @xmath83 to @xmath84c without using a high - power consuming peltier element .",
    "mems metal oxide gas sensors , which require operating temperatures several hundreds of celsius degrees above room temperature , have met this challenge by fitting the sensing element to heat insulating hinges , patterning the sensing element with the heating coil , and confining the heating to the part of interest , in our case the volume in which the acoustic energy is stored , reaching sub-100  mw consumption to reach 300@xmath0c for 1000  @xmath34m@xmath3 large devices @xcite . we think that the power consumption of a hbar oscillator for mac applications could be reduced at a maximum of 1020  mw .",
    "nevertheless , a question remains . in standard macs ,",
    "the output useful signal frequency for end - users is 10 mhz . in a potential hbar - based oscillator cs vapor cell mac ,",
    "the lo is frequency - stabilized at 4.596  ghz .",
    "this microwave frequency is not well - adapted for standard widespread applications .",
    "this issue would impose to use a frequency divider to downconvert the 4.596  ghz signal to about 100 or 10  mhz , adding a power consumption of 1020  mw if dedicated components are used @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated that hbar oscillators exhibit ultra - low phase noise performances .",
    "hence , it is interesting to note that macs using hbar - based oscillators could allow the development of time - frequency references combining in a single device excellent phase noise and long - term frequency stability properties , opening potentially the mac technology to a wider spectrum of applications . up to date",
    ", the short - term fractional frequency stability of macs is mainly limited by the laser fm noise and not by the lo intermodulation effect .",
    "thus , to date , improving the lo noise with hbar - based oscillators should not improve the clock short - term stability .",
    "however , we demonstrated that the use of a hbar - lo rejects the dick effect contribution to a level close to the clock shot noise limit .",
    "this aspect could be of great interest in the future if new - generation high - performance macs using miniature low - consumption lasers with ultra - narrow spectral linewidth @xcite and reduced am noise were developed .",
    "we reported the design strategy and the use of a double - port aln / sapphire 2.298  ghz hbar - oscillator - based 4.596  ghz frequency synthesizer devoted to be used as a local oscillator in a cs vapor cell cpt - based atomic clock .",
    "dedicated techniques , exploiting the hbar temperature sensitivity for coarse frequency tuning and the use of a vcps in the oscillator loop , were proposed to ensure the hbar - oscillator frequency to be resonant with the half of cs atom clock frequency ( 4.596  ghz ) .",
    "the hbar presents a q - factor of about 24000 and a temperature sensitivity of @xmath4823 ppm/@xmath50c .",
    "the 4.596  ghz output signal exhibits exceptional phase noise performances of @xmath2  dbrad@xmath3/hz at 1  khz offset frequency , rejecting the intermodulation effect contribution to the clock short - term fractional frequency stability at the level of @xmath85 , a value comparable to the clock quantum noise limit . a cs microcell - based cpt clock was tested using the hbar - source , demonstrating a clock short - term frequency stability of @xmath79 , limited by the cpt resonance signal - to - noise ratio and not by the lo phase noise .",
    "discussions were reported to evaluate the potential of this technology to be implemented in low - volume and low power consumption miniature atomic clocks .",
    "this work has been funded by labex first - tf .",
    "the hbar was manufactured by cea / leti in the framework of the orage rapid project funded by the french direction gnrale de larmement ( dga ) agency .",
