    "the zodiacal cloud ( zc ) is a circumsolar disk of small debris particles produced by asteroid collisions and comets .",
    "nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter n10 ) developed a dynamical model for particle populations released by asteroids and comets , and used the model to determine the relative contribution of asteroid and cometary material to the zc .",
    "they found that the mid - infrared ( mir ) emission from particles produced in the asteroid belt is mostly confined to within latitudes @xmath12 of the ecliptic .",
    "conversely , the zc has a broad latitudinal distribution so that strong thermal emission is observed even in the direction to the ecliptic poles ( e.g. , hauser et al . 1984 , kelsall et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this shows that asteroidal particles can represent only a small fraction of the zc .",
    "based on a comparison of the model with observations of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) , n10 proposed that @xmath1390% of the zc s emission at mir wavelengths comes from dust grains released by jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) , and @xmath1410% comes from the oort cloud comets ( occs ) , halley - type comets ( htcs ) and/or asteroid collisions .",
    "in addition , it was found that the mass input required to keep the zc in a steady state largely exceeds the mass loss in jfcs due to their normal activity ( e.g. , reach et al .",
    "2007 ) . to resolve this problem , n10 suggested that the dominant mass fraction is supplied to the zc by spontaneous _ disruptions / splittings _ of jfcs ( e.g. , fernndez 2005 , di sisto et al . 2009 ) .",
    "n10 s model implies that the orbits of small meteoroids ( diameters @xmath15 @xmath10 m ) released by jfcs become significantly circularized by poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag before they can reach @xmath16 au , and contribute to the earth impact record .",
    "these particles , at the time of their accretion by the earth , should thus have relatively low impact speeds ( @xmath17 km s@xmath7 ) , low eccentricities , and @xmath18 au .",
    "the large jfc particles ( @xmath19 mm ) , on the other hand , should have a broader distribution of impact speeds , large eccentricities , and @xmath20 - 4 au , mainly because they have presumably short collisional lifetimes ( grn et al . 1985 ; hereafter g85 ) , and disrupt before they can significantly evolve by p - r drag . as we discuss below , these results appear to be at odds with the observations of sporadic meteors .",
    "meteors are produced by small interplanetary particles also known as the _ meteoroids_. based on meteor data , the meteoroids can be divided into two groups : sporadic meteoroids and meteoroid streams .",
    "the meteoroid streams are prominent concentrations of particles with similar orbits ( whipple 1951 ) .",
    "they are thought to be produced by particles released by active and recently ( @xmath11 few thousand years ago ) disrupted comets ( jenniskens 2008 ) .",
    "sporadic meteoroids are those particles that have evolved significantly from their parent body so that they are no longer easily linked to that parent , or to other meteoroids from the same parent .",
    "notably , the time - integrated flux of meteors at earth is dominated by about a factor of @xmath810 by sporadics ( jones & brown 1993 ) .",
    "the radiant distribution of sporadic meteors shows several concentrations on the sky known as the helion / antihelion , north / south apex , and north / south toroidal sources ( e.g. , campbell - brown 2008 , and the references therein ) .",
    "the prominent helion / antihelion source is the concentration of meteors near the helion and antihelion directions .",
    "these meteors are believed to originate from the same population of meteoroids .",
    "the two groups differ in impact direction because some particles will impact before their perihelion passage , thus producing meteors with the antihelion radiants , while others will impact after their perihelion passage , producing meteors with the helion radiants .",
    "the helion / antihelion meteoroids have a measured impact speed distribution that peaks at @xmath21 - 30 km s@xmath7 , @xmath18 au with a tail to 3 au and beyond , @xmath22 , and low inclinations ( fig .",
    "[ amor0 ] ) .",
    "wiegert et al .",
    "( 2009 ; hereafter w09 ) developed a dynamical model to explain these observations .",
    "they found that particles released by jfcs , mainly by 2p / encke , provide the best match to the observed properties of the helion / antihelion source ( see also jones et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "comet 2p / encke has an orbit that is quite unique among jfcs ( @xmath23 au , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , because its aphelion distance lies well within jupiter s orbit ( @xmath26 au ) .",
    "the orbit is relatively stable as it is not affected by close encounters with jupiter .",
    "in addition , the comet has a very low perihelion distance ( @xmath27 au ) and is expected to fall into the sun in @xmath6-@xmath28 years ( levison & duncan 1994 ) , if it physically survived that long . finally , 2p / encke is the source of several meteor streams known as taurids ( whipple 1939 ) , suggesting , as argued in w09 , that it can also be an important source of sporadic meteoroids at 1 au .",
    "the difference between w09 and n10 lies , in part , in different assumptions on the initial distribution of meteoroids . in w09 ,",
    "the meteoroids launched from 2p / encke initially had a low perihelion distance so that even after having evolved by p - r drag to @xmath18 au , they still retained a relatively large eccentricity .",
    "in n10 , on the other hand , most meteoroids were released with @xmath29 au , and greater effects of p - r drag were thus required for particles to reach 1 au .",
    "in addition , n10 did not properly include the detection efficiency of meteor radars in their model .",
    "this is a central issue , because most meteor radars are only capable of detecting the relatively large and/or fast meteoroids , and may thus produce measurements of the earth accretion flux that are heavily biased by their detection capabilities .",
    "the agreement between the w09 model and observations of helion / antihelion meteors is not perfect .",
    "for example , the w09 model produced tightly clustered distributions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 about @xmath32 km s@xmath7 and @xmath24 , and lacked orbits with @xmath33 au ( fig . 2 in w09 ) .",
    "the observed speeds and eccentricities have larger spreads , perhaps indicating that the helion / antihelion meteors are produced not by one , but many parent comets with a broad distribution of orbits , including those with @xmath33 au",
    ". the inclination distribution produced in w09 does not have the resolution needed for a careful comparison with data , but it also seems to be narrower than the observed distribution .",
    "while 2p / encke , or orbitally similar comets , can be an important source for helion / antihelion meteors , comet 2p / encke itself can not be a single dominant source of the zc .",
    "this is because studies of the zc indicate that @xmath81000 kg s@xmath7 of material need to be injected into interplanetary space to keep the zc in a steady state ( e.g. , leinert et al .",
    "1983 , n10 ) . also , according to n10 , the present mass of the inner zc at @xmath115 au is @xmath81-@xmath34 g , which is roughly equivalent to that of a 25 km diameter body .",
    "for comparison , the mass loss in comet 2p / encke is only @xmath826 kg s@xmath7 , based on observations of its dust trail ( reach et al .",
    "2007 ) , and diameter of the nucleus is @xmath35 4.8 km ( fernandez et al .",
    "2000 , boehnhardt et al . 2008 ) .",
    "according to n10 , the dominant mass fraction is supplied to the zc by spontaneous disruptions / splittings of jfcs . since meteoroids in the zc",
    "are also expected to produce meteors , the meteor observations discussed above can place important constraints on the zc s origin . to take advantage of these constraints , and motivated by the results discussed above , we modify n10 s model to include a @xmath36-dependent meteoroid production rate , au , it becomes apparent that the model density profile drops far too slowly for @xmath37 au to match observations .",
    "this means that the comets with small @xmath36 values must disappear , due to physical effects , more quickly than those with large @xmath36 values . to match the observed profile , di sisto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested that the disruption probability of jfcs scales with @xmath36 as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 - 1 . ] and account for the detection efficiency of meteor surveys .",
    "we also improve n10 s model to consider a continuous size frequency distribution ( sfd ) of particles , and more precisely parametrize their collisional disruption in space .",
    "we show that , with these modifications of the n10 model , the results match available constraints .",
    "we describe the new model in section 2 .",
    "the results are reported in section 3 .",
    "we estimate the zc s cross section and mass , meteoroid production rate required to keep the zc in a steady state , and the terrestrial accretion rate of interplanetary dust .",
    "our model includes the following parts : ( 1 ) particles of different sizes are released from jfcs ( section 2.1 ) , ( 2 ) their orbits evolve under the influence of gravitational and radiation forces ( section 2.2 ) , ( 3 ) some particles are thermally or collisionally destroyed ( section 2.3 ) , ( 4 ) while in space , particles emit thermal radiation ( section 2.4 ) , which ( 5 ) is detected by a telescope observing at mir wavelengths ( section 2.5 ) , and ( 6 ) a small fraction of the initial particle population is accreted by the earth , producing meteors ( section 2.6 ) .",
    "we describe components ( 1)-(6 ) below .",
    "procedures described in sections 2.5 and 2.6 are mainly required because the raw particle distributions obtained from our numerical integrations of orbits in section 2.2 do not have a sufficient resolution .",
    "we use analytical methods to enhance the resolution in a way that is suitable for ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "we only consider jfcs in this paper , because previous works showed that they are the main source of the zc particles and helion / antihelion meteors ( e.g. , jones et al . 2001 , w09 , n10 ) .",
    "the asteroid meteoroids have low impact speeds and are not detected by meteor radars .",
    "the meteoroids released from long - period comets contribute to apex meteors and are not modeled here ( see nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for a discussion of apex meteors ) .",
    "the orbital distribution of jfcs was taken from levison & duncan ( 1997 ; hereafter ld97 ) , who followed the orbital evolution of bodies originating in the kuiper belt as they are scattered by planets , and evolve in small fractions into the inner solar system .",
    "for each critical perihelion distance , @xmath40 , we selected bodies from ld97 s simulations when they reached @xmath41 for the first time .",
    "particles were released from these source orbits .",
    "we used 10 values of @xmath40 equally spaced between 0.25 au and 2.5 au , particles with @xmath42 , 30 , 100 , 300 , 1000 , 3000 @xmath10 m , which should cover the interesting range of sizes , and particle density @xmath43 g @xmath44 .",
    "our tests show that this size resolution is adequate because the orbital dynamics of , say , a @xmath45-@xmath10 m particle is similar to that of a @xmath46-@xmath10 m particle .",
    "the results for a continuous range of sizes were obtained by interpolation .",
    "varying particle density has only a small effect on their orbital dynamics .",
    "ten thousand particles were released for each @xmath40 and @xmath47 for the total of 0.6 million of the initial orbits .    upon their release from the parent object",
    ", particles will feel the effects of radiation pressure .",
    "these effects can be best described by replacing the mass of the sun , @xmath48 , by @xmath49 , with @xmath50 given by @xmath51 where the particle s radius @xmath52 and @xmath53 are in cgs units .",
    "pressure coefficient @xmath54 can be determined using the mie theory ( burns et al .",
    "we set @xmath55 , which corresponds to the geometrical optics limit , where @xmath56 is much larger than the incident - light wavelength .",
    "note that all particles considered here are large enough to stay on bound heliocentric orbits after their release ( see , e.g. , nesvorn et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in section 3 ,",
    "we combine the results obtained with different @xmath40 and @xmath47 to mimic the continuous distributions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is different from n10 where the source particle distributions were parametrized by the ` fading time ' , particle production rate was assumed to be @xmath36-independent , and @xmath58 was approximated by single size .",
    "here we consider @xmath57 and @xmath58 that can be approximated by simple power laws . for @xmath57",
    ", we thus have @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a free parameter . for @xmath58",
    ", we have @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a normalization constant and @xmath63 is the usual slope index ( at source ) .",
    "alternatively , we use the two - slope sfd with @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are free parameters .",
    "parameter @xmath60 can be inferred from the number of jfcs found at each @xmath36 , and their disruption probability as a function of @xmath36 . if the former can be approximated by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 ( ld97 , di sisto et al . 2009 ) , and the latter is proportional to @xmath38 , where @xmath73 - 1 ( di sisto et al .",
    "2009 ) , it would be expected that @xmath74 - 0",
    ". we use @xmath75 as our starting value , and test the sensitivity of results for @xmath76 and @xmath77 . as for @xmath58 , we set @xmath78 for the whole size range , as motivated by meteor radar observations ( e.g. , galligan & baggaley 2004 ) , or @xmath79 @xmath10 m , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , as motivated by space impact experiments ( e.g. , love & brownlee 1993 ) . given the various uncertainties of these measurements ( see , e.g. , mathews et al . 2001 ) , we also test @xmath82 @xmath10 m and @xmath83 @xmath10 m .",
    "the particle orbits were numerically integrated with the swift_rmvs3 code ( levison & duncan 1994 ) , which is an efficient implementation of the wisdom - holman map ( wisdom & holman 1991 ) and which , in addition , can deal with close encounters between particles and planets .",
    "the radiation pressure and poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag forces were inserted into the keplerian and kick parts of the integrator , respectively .",
    "the change to the keplerian part was trivially done by substituting @xmath48 by @xmath49 .",
    "we assumed that the solar - wind drag force has the same functional form as the p - r term and contributes by 30% to the total drag intensity .",
    "the code tracks the orbital evolution of a particle that revolves around the sun and is subject to the gravitational perturbations of seven planets ( venus to neptune ; the mass of mercury was added to the sun ) until the particle impacts a planet , is ejected from the solar system , evolves to within 0.05  au from the sun , or the integration time reaches 5 myr .",
    "we removed particles that evolved to @xmath84  au , because the orbital period for @xmath84  au was not properly resolved by our 1-day integration timestep .",
    "the particle orbits were recorded at 1,000-yr time intervals to be used for further analysis .",
    "the solar system meteoroids can be destroyed by collisions with other particles and by solar heating that can lead to sublimation and vaporisation of minerals . here",
    "we explain how we parametrize these processes in our model .",
    "the jfc particles will rapidly loose their volatile ices .",
    "we do not model the volatile loss here .",
    "the remaining grains will be primarily composed from amorphous silicates and will survive down to very small heliocentric distances .",
    "following moro - martn & malhotra ( 2002 ) , kessler - silacci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and others , we adopt a simple criterion for the silicate grain destruction .",
    "we assume that they are thermally destroyed ( sublimate , vaporise ) when the grain temperature reaches @xmath85 k.    using the optical constants of amorphous pyroxene of approximately cosmic composition ( henning & mutschke 1997 ) , we find that a dark @xmath86-@xmath10 m grain at @xmath87 has the equilibrium temperature within 10 k of a black body , @xmath88 k. according to our simple destruction criterion , @xmath85 k , the silicate grains should thus be removed when reaching @xmath89 au .",
    "on the other hand , the smallest particles considered in this work ( @xmath42 @xmath10 m ) have @xmath90 k at @xmath91 au .",
    "thus , we opted for a simple criterion where particles of all sizes were instantly destroyed , and were not considered for statistics , when they reached @xmath92 au .",
    "note that , by design , this limit is the same as the one imposed by the integration timestep ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "the collisional lifetime of meteoroids , @xmath93 , was taken from g85 .",
    "it was assumed to be a function of particle mass , @xmath94 , and orbital parameters , mainly @xmath95 and @xmath31 .",
    "for example , for a circular orbit at 1 au , particles with @xmath46 @xmath10 m and 1 mm have @xmath96 yr and @xmath97 yr , respectively , where @xmath98 denotes the collisional lifetime from g85 .",
    "also , @xmath98 increases with @xmath95 .",
    "to cope with the uncertainty of the g85 s model , we introduced a free parameter , @xmath99 , so that @xmath100 . values @xmath101",
    "increase @xmath93 relative to @xmath98 , as expected , for example , if particles were stronger than assumed in g85 , or if the measured impact fluxes were lower ( e.g. , dikarev et  al .",
    "2005 , drolshagen et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "see nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for a fuller description .",
    "collisional disruption of particles was taken into account during processing the output from the numerical integration described in section 2.2 . to account for the stochastic nature of breakups",
    ", we determined the breakup probability @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the output interval , and @xmath93 was computed individually for each particle s orbit .",
    "the code then generated a random number @xmath104 , and eliminated the particle if @xmath105 .",
    "we caution that our procedure does not take into account the small debris fragments that are generated by disruptions of larger particles . instead",
    ", all fragments are removed from the system .",
    "this is an important approximation whose validity needs to be tested in the future .",
    "meteoroids were assumed to be isothermal , rapidly rotating spheres .",
    "the absorption was assumed to occur into an effective cross section @xmath106 , and emission out of @xmath107 . the infrared flux density ( per wavelength interval @xmath108 ) per unit surface area at distance @xmath109 from a thermally radiating particle with radius @xmath56 is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the emissivity and @xmath112 is the energy flux at @xmath113 per surface area from a black body at temperature @xmath114 : @xmath115^{-1 } \\ . \\label{bb}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath116 j s is the planck constant , @xmath117 m s@xmath7 is the speed of light , and @xmath118 j k@xmath119 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "since our model does not include detailed emissivity properties of dust grains at different wavelengths , we set the emissivity at 25 @xmath10 m to be 1 and fit for the emissivities at 12 and 60  @xmath10 m .",
    "we found that the relative emissivities at 12 and 60 @xmath10 m that match the data best are 0.70 - 0.75 and 0.95 - 1 , respectively .",
    "such a variability of mir emissivity values at different wavelengths is expected for small silicate particles with some carbon content .",

    "[ mean ] .",
    "we used the pik theory ( pik 1951 ) to estimate the expected terrestrial accretion rate of jfc particles in our model .",
    "wetherill ( 1967 ) , and later greenberg ( 1982 ) , improved the theory by extending it more rigorously to the case of two eccentric orbits .",
    "here we used a computer code that employs greenberg s formalism ( bottke et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "we modified the code to compute the radiants of the impacting particles .",
    "in doing so we properly accounted for all impact configurations and weighted the results by the probability with which each individual configuration occurs , including focusing .",
    "the radiants were expressed in the coordinate system , where longitude @xmath124 was measured from the earth s apex in counter - clockwise direction along the earth s orbit , and latitude @xmath125 was measured relative to the earth s orbital plane .",
    "note that our definition of longitude differs from the one more commonly used for radar meteors , where the longitude is measured from the helion direction .",
    "the radiants were calculated before the effects of gravitational focusing were applied .",
    "the meteor radars use different detection methods ( i.e. , trail vs. echo ) and have different sensitivities .",
    "their detection efficiency is mainly a function of the particle s mass and speed , but it also depends on a number of other parameters discussed , for example , in janches et al . (",
    "following w09 , we opt for a simple parametrization of the radar sensitivity function , where the detection is represented by the ionization function @xmath141 all meteors with @xmath142 are assumed to be detected in our model , while all meteors with @xmath143 are not detected .",
    "the ionization cutoff @xmath144 is taken to be different for different radars .",

    "we performed hundreds of tests with the model described in section 2 .",
    "the main parameters of these tests were : the ( 1 ) size distribution of jfc particles at the source , as defined by @xmath70 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , ( 2 ) power index of the initial perihelion distribution , @xmath154 , and ( 3 ) collisional lifetime of particles , @xmath93 . to compare our model with meteor observations",

    "we first discuss selected cases that illustrate the trends with different parameters .",
    "these cases are generally representative for a wide range of parameter values , as explained in the following text .",
    "we start by discussing the results relevant to amor , because amor is capable of detecting particles with @xmath156 @xmath10 m ( fig .",
    "[ icut ] ) , and can thus provide constraints on the particle sizes that are thought to be dominant in the zc .",

    "corresponding to no cutoff on mass or impact speed , the impact speed distribution , @xmath161 , is strongly peaked toward the earth s escape speed ( @xmath162 km s@xmath7 ) .",

    "_ this illustrates the crucial importance of the ionization cutoff for the interpretation of meteor radar observations . _",
    "given the strong effect of the ionization cutoff it is difficult to imagine how the radar observations can be correctly ` debiased ' , based solely on the measurements , corrections , and considerations of the earth - impact probability of different orbits ( e.g. , taylor & mcbride 1997 , galligan & baggaley 2004 , campbell - brown 2008 ) , to obtain the real distribution of meteoroids at 1  au .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ amor1 ] , the real distribution can be very different from the observed one ; although meteors at low speeds may dominate the real distribution , only a tiny fraction are detected .",
    "this highlights the importance of dynamical modeling .    in a similar fashion , the observed eccentricity distribution , @xmath165 ,",

    "it is unclear , however , if the effect of the collisional cascade is important .",
    "future work will need to address this problem .",
    "the radar observations of sporadic meteors reveal an important population of meteoroids that impact earth from the helion and antihelion directions .",
    "typically , these particles have heliocentric orbits with @xmath16 au , @xmath22 , @xmath188 , and dive into the upper atmosphere at speeds @xmath276 - 30 km s@xmath7 .",
    "these results were seemingly inconsistent with the model of the circumsolar meteoroid complex developed in n10 , which has been calibrated on the iras s mir observations of the zc s thermal emission .",
    "the n10 model implied that particles impacting earth from the helion / antihelion directions should either have @xmath277 au and @xmath278 , or @xmath279 - 4 au and @xmath280 .",
    "the former case corresponds to @xmath15-@xmath10 m meteoroids , whose orbits evolved by p - r drag .",
    "the latter case are the large , @xmath19-mm particles that were assumed in n10 to be collisionally disrupted before their orbits could significantly evolve by p - r drag .",
    "the different orbital histories of small and large meteoroids in the n10 model would mean that the meteor radars with different detection thresholds should measure very different distributions of the impact speeds and orbits .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "here we showed that the above problem can be resolved if : ( 1 ) the n10 model is modified to account for the detection efficiency of meteor radars ; ( 2 ) meteoroids are released from jfcs over a range of perihelion distances with at least some fraction initially having @xmath281 au ; and ( 3 ) @xmath198 mm particles have significantly longer ( @xmath1330 times ) collisional lifetimes than those estimated in g85 . with these modifications of the n10 model ,",
    "the results match meteor constraints",
    ".    we also found , using the amor observations as a constraint , that @xmath156-@xmath10 m particles can not have much longer collisional lifetimes than proposed in g85 .",
    "together with ( 3 ) , these results therefore suggest that @xmath156 @xmath10 m and @xmath198 mm meteoroids may have more comparable collisional lifetimes ( a few times @xmath6 yr for a circular orbit at 1 au ) than thought before .",
    "if so , the sfd shape inferred from the measurements of the spacecraft impact detectors ( such as , e.g. , ulysses , galileo , ldef ; g85 , love & brownlee 1993 ) may be more closely related to the initial sfd of particles released at sources then to the collisional destruction of particles in space .",
    "we showed that the modified n10 model can successfully match the telescopic observations of the zodiacal cloud . using iras to calibrate the model",
    ", we estimated that the cross section and mass of the zodiacal cloud are @xmath282-@xmath3 km@xmath4 and @xmath283  g. the terrestrial accretion rate of jfc particles was found to be @xmath284 tons yr@xmath7 , of which only a few percent should be detected by cmor , and 10 - 50% should be detected by the more sensitive amor .",
    "moreover , some @xmath285-@xmath286 kg s@xmath7 of material must be provided by jfcs to keep the zc in a steady state .",
    "this new input mass estimate is up to @xmath810 times larger than the one suggested by n10 ( see also leinert et al .",
    "1983 ) , because particles starting with low @xmath36 have shorter lifetimes , and need to be resupplied at a faster rate .",
    "this new estimate resonates with the n10 model in which the zc is dominated by the meteoroids released by disrupting / splitting jfcs , because the observed activity of jfcs can not provide the needed input .",
