    "on 2014 january 2 , asteroid 2014  aa became the second example of an object discovered just prior to hitting the earth ( brown 2014 ; jenniskens 2014 ) . over five years before this event occurred",
    ", similarly small 2008  tc@xmath0 had stricken our planet hours after being first spotted ( chodas et al .",
    "2009 ; jenniskens et al . 2009 ; oszkiewicz et al .",
    "the fireball caused by the entry of 2008  tc@xmath0 was observed by the meteosat 8 weather satellite ( borovika & charvt 2009 ) ; no images of the atmospheric entry of 2014  aa have emerged yet , although there is robust evidence for an impact over the atlantic ocean ( chesley et al .",
    "2015 ; farnocchia et al .",
    "2016 ) less than a day after this small asteroid was discovered .",
    "the uncertainty associated with the pre - impact orbit of 2008  tc@xmath0 is relatively small because thousands of observations were made during the hours preceding the actual strike ( chodas et al .",
    "2009 ; jenniskens et al . 2009 ; kozubal et al . 2011 ; oszkiewicz et al .",
    "in sharp contrast , 2014  aa was only observed seven times before impact ( kowalski et al .",
    "2014 ) and consequently its pre - impact orbit is somewhat uncertain ( chesley et al . 2014 , 2015 ;",
    "farnocchia et al .",
    "both objects hit the earth about 20 hours after they were first detected ( farnocchia et al .",
    "asteroid 2008  tc@xmath0 completely broke up over northern sudan on 2008 october 7 ( jenniskens et al .",
    "2009 ) ; asteroid 2014  aa probably met a similar end over the atlantic ocean .",
    "meteorites were collected from 2008  tc@xmath0 ( jenniskens et al .",
    "2009 ) ; any surviving meteorites from 2014  aa were likely lost to the sea .",
    "both 2008  tc@xmath0 and 2014  aa had similar sizes of a few metres .",
    "such small asteroids or meteoroids ( diameter @xmath15 10 m ) are probably fragments of larger objects , which may also be fragments themselves .",
    "the study of the orbital dynamics of such fragments is a subject of considerable practical interest because small bodies dominate the risk of unanticipated earth impacts with just local effects ( brown et al .",
    "asteroid fragmentation could be induced by collisional processes ( e.g. dorschner 1974 ; ryan 2000 ) but also be the combined result of thermal fatigue ( e.g. apek & vokrouhlick 2010 ) and rotational ( e.g. walsh et al .",
    "2008 ) or tidal stresses ( e.g. richardson et al . 1998 ; tth et al .",
    "the present - day rate of catastrophic disruption events of asteroids in the main belt has been recently studied by denneau et al .",
    "these authors have found that the frequency of this phenomenon is much higher than previously thought , with rotational disruptions being the dominant source of fragments .",
    "production of fragments can be understood within the context of active asteroids ( see e.g. jewitt 2012 ; jewitt et al .",
    "2015 ; drahus et al . 2015 ; agarwal et al .",
    "2016 ) .    here",
    ", we revisit the topic of the impact parameters of 2014  aa , then apply monte carlo and @xmath4-body techniques to obtain an independent determination of the pre - impact orbit of 2014  aa .",
    "the computed orbital solution is used to investigate the existence of near - earth objects ( neos ) moving in similar orbits .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we review what is currently known about 2014  aa . the atmospheric entry of 2014  aa is revisited in sect .",
    "3 ; an improved impact solution ( location and timing ) , that is based on a refined analysis of infrasound recordings , is presented .",
    "a monte carlo technique is used in sect . 4 to estimate the most probable , in geometric terms , pre - impact orbit .",
    "an @xmath4-body approach is described and applied in sect . 5 to obtain a more realistic orbital solution . in sect .",
    "6 , we provide an extensive and detailed comparison with results obtained by other authors and show that all the solutions published so far are reasonably consistent .",
    "based on the new solution , the recent past orbital evolution of 2014  aa is reconstructed in sect .",
    "7 . a number of perhaps dynamically - related small bodies are discussed in sect . 8 .",
    "section 9 summarizes our conclusions ."
