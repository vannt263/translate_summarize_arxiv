    "[ fig : vtriexp]b ) . + especially point _ ( iii ) _ warrants a discussion . in the triangulation method",
    ", we can only get full agreement between experiment and theoretical values expected for @xmath118 for the most favorable cutoff in @xmath9 .",

    "[ sec : exp ] give us values for @xmath130 .",
    "we obtained an exponent @xmath176 . with @xmath100 ,",

    "+ nevertheless , @xmath129 is not matching , even though the triangulation method is expected to work as per our calibration of the triangulation method on the numerical data .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the deviation : either we have missed a systematic experimental bias in our methods , or the thin film equation eq .",
    "[ eq : filmfull ] does not describe the dynamics very well close to the collapse .",
    "one approximation in the thin film equation is that surface gradients are small @xmath177 .",
    "close to the collapse moment , the fluid surface however forms an axisymmetric `` funnel '' touching the base of the container , in which this approximation seems less valid .",
    "in particular the strength of the loop curvature contribution will become relevant close to the collapse .",
    "the strength of this term in the laplacian of the surface shape also depends on the smallness of the surface gradient terms , which in the current expression may not be fully appreciated .",
    "+ the bond number that we used to quantify the transition from gravity to surface tension driven dynamics does not allow one to experimentally probe a large range , as the material parameters included are difficult to vary over many orders of magnitude .",
    "we chose this bond number definition to make the collapse timescale dependence on the filling height @xmath14 consistent with experiments .",
    "it can however be argued that just before the collapse the dynamics is indeed not anymore dependent on boundary conditions such as the total volume ( and hence @xmath15 ) and that a different length scale should be chosen to nondimensionalize the thin film equations .",
    "for example , one could let the bond number scale with @xmath178 instead of @xmath179 . in these thin film applications typically @xmath180 , which would push @xmath114 at least four orders of magnitude lower , and the transition point between gravity driven and surface tension driven flows to @xmath181 , a more reasonable number .",
    "given the mentioned uncertainties of the curvature approximations already included in the current modeling , we leave these questions for future work .     for both least squares method ( @xmath182 ) and the triangulation method ( @xmath156 ) .",

    "we studied the effect of surface tension on viscous gravity currents in a novel experimental setup , quantifying the relative strength of the surface tension with a bond number that depends on the reservoir radius .",
    "we show that the converging surface profile is of self - similar form in the surface tension dominated regime , and we derive relations between exponents for both bo limits .",
    "extracting power - law exponents on log - log scale turns out to not be accurate enough in the context of the exponents of similarity solutions .",
    "we thus develop two complementary methods to extract scaling information from the self - similar structure of the converging surface profile .",
    "these methods allow us to analyze numerical data over the complete range of purely gravity driven , to purely surface tension dominated flows , and allow for a comparison with experimental data .",
