    "despite the remarkable success of perturbative qcd the description of hadronic states and processes based on the dynamics of confined quarks and gluons remains the outstanding challenge of strong interaction physics .",
    "especially , one has to explain why only hadrons are produced from processes involving hadronic initial states , and that the only thresholds in hadronic amplitudes are due to the productions of other hadronic states . to this end one would like to understand how singularities appear in the green s functions of composite hadron fields where , on the other hand , they have to disappear in colored correlations functions .    to study these aspects of qcd amplitudes",
    "non  perturbative methods are required , and , since infrared divergences are anticipated , a formulation in the continuum is desirable .",
    "both of these are provided by studies of truncated systems of dyson ",
    "schwinger equations ( dses ) , the equations of motion of qcd green s functions .",
    "typically , for their truncation , additional sources of information like the slavnov  taylor identities , entailed by gauge invariance , are used to express vertex functions in terms of the elementary two  point functions , i.e. , the quark , ghost and gluon propagators .",
    "those propagators can then be obtained as selfconsistent solutions to non  linear integral equations representing a closed set of truncated dses .",
    "some systematic control over the truncating assumptions can be obtained by successively including higher @xmath1point functions in selfconsistent calculations , and by assessing their influence on lower @xmath1point functions in this way . until recently all solutions to truncated dses of qcd in landau gauge , even in absence of quarks , relyed on neglecting ghost contributions completely @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing a better understanding of confinement based on studies of the behavior of qcd green s functions in the infrared , dses have proven successful in developing a hadron phenomenology which interpolates smoothly between the infrared non  perturbative and the ultraviolet perturbative regime @xcite , for recent reviews see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "in particular , a dynamical description of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry from studies of the dse for the quark propagator is well established in a variety of models for the gluonic interactions of quarks  @xcite . for a sufficiently large low  energy quark ",
    "quark interaction quark masses are generated dynamically in the quark dse in some analogy to the gap equation in superconductivity .",
    "this in turn leads naturally to the goldstone nature of the pion and explains the smallness of its mass as compared to all other hadrons . in this framework",
    "a description of the different types of mesons is obtained from bethe ",
    "salpeter equations for quark  antiquark bound states  @xcite .",
    "recent progress towards a solution of a fully relativistic three  body equation extends this consistent framework to baryonic bound states , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite and references therein .    here",
    "a simultaneous solution of a truncated set of dses for the propagators of gluons and ghosts in landau gauge is presented @xcite .",
    "an extension of this selfconsistent framework to include quarks is subject to on  going research @xcite .",
    "preliminary results for the quark propagator in the quenched approximation have been obtained and will be shown .",
    "the behavior of the solutions in the infrared , implying the existence of a fixed point at a critical coupling @xmath2 , is obtained analytically .",
    "the gluon propagator is shown to vanish for small spacelike momenta in the present truncation scheme .",
    "this behavior , though in contradiction with previous dse studies  @xcite , can be understood from the observation that , in our present calculation , the previously neglected ghost propagator assumes an infrared enhancement similar to what was then obtained for the gluon . in the meantime",
    "such a qualitative behavior of gluon and ghost propagators is supported by investigations of the coupled gluon ghost dses using bare vertices  @xcite . as expected ,",
    "however , the details of the results depend on the approximations employed .",
    "besides all elementary 2point functions , i.e. , the quark , ghost and gluon propagators , the dse for the gluon propagator also involves the 3 and 4point vertex functions which obey their own dses .",
    "these equations involve successively higher n  point functions .",
    "the gluon equation is truncated by neglecting all terms with 4gluon vertices .",
    "these are the momentum independent tadpole term , an irrelevant constant which vanishes perturbatively in landau gauge , and explicit 2loop contributions to the gluon dse .",
    "for all details regarding this truncation scheme we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the ghost and gluon propagators are parameterized by their respective renormalization functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 in order to arrive at a closed set of equations for the functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we use a form for the ghost ",
    "gluon vertex which is based on a construction from its slavnov  taylor identity ( sti ) which can be derived from the usual becchi",
    "stora invariance neglecting irreducible 4ghost correlations in agreement with the present level of truncation  @xcite .",
    "this together with the crossing symmetry of the ghost ",
    "gluon vertex fully determines its form at the present level of truncation : @xmath6 with this result , we can construct the 3gluon vertex according to procedures developed and used previously  @xcite , for details see @xcite .",
    "we have solved the coupled system of integral equations of the present truncation scheme numerically using an angle approximation .",
    "the infrared behavior of the propagators can , however , be deduced analytically . to this end",
    "we make the ansatz that for @xmath7 the product @xmath8 with @xmath9 and some constant @xmath10 .",
    "the special case @xmath11 leads to a logarithmic singularity for @xmath12 which precludes the possibility of a selfconsistent solution . in order to obtain a positive definite function @xmath13 for positive @xmath14 from an equally positive @xmath15 , as @xmath16",
    ", we obtain the further restriction @xmath17 .",
    "the ghost dse then yields , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the leading order perturbative coefficient of the anomalous dimension of the ghost field . using these relations in the gluon dse",
    ", we find that the 3gluon loop contributes terms @xmath20 to the gluon equation for @xmath12 while the dominant ( infrared singular ) contribution arises from the ghost ",
    "loop , @xmath21 requiring a unique behavior for @xmath15 we obtain a quadratic equation for @xmath22 with a unique solution for the exponent in @xmath23 : @xmath24 the leading behavior of the gluon and ghost renormalization functions and thus of their propagators is entirely due to ghost contributions .",
    "the details of the approximations to the 3gluon loop have no influence on the above considerations . compared to the mandelstam approximation ,",
    "in which the 3gluon loop alone determines the infrared behavior of the gluon propagator and the running coupling in landau gauge  @xcite , this shows the importance of ghosts .",
    "the result presented here implies an infrared stable fixed point in the non  perturbative running coupling of our subtraction scheme , defined by @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the infrared singular coupling of the mandelstam approximation  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare our solutions to recent lattice results available for the gluon propagator  @xcite and for the ghost propagator  @xcite using lattice versions to implement the landau gauge condition .",
    "we would like to refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite where this has been done in some detail .",
    "it is very encouraging to observe that our solution fits the lattice data at low momenta rather well , especially for the ghost propagator .",
    "we therefore conclude that present lattice calculations confirm the existence of an infrared enhanced ghost propagator of the form @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "this is an interesting result for yet another reason : in the calculation of @xcite the landau gauge condition was supplemented by an algorithm to select gauge field configurations from the fundamental modular region which is to avoid gribov copies .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the existence of such copies of gauge configurations might have little effect on the solutions to landau gauge dses .    here",
    "we want to add a remark concerning the comparison of the running coupling obtained in our calculation to lattice results .",
    "recent lattice calculations of the running coupling are reported in refs .",
    "@xcite based on the 3gluon vertex , and ref .",
    "@xcite on the quark ",
    "gluon vertex .",
    "the non  perturbative definitions of these couplings are related but manifestly different from the one adopted here .",
    "one of the most recent results from the 3gluon vertex is shown in the left graph of fig .",
    "[ lat_alpha ] and compared to the three ",
    "loop expression which is for the momenta displayed almost identical to our expression ( 4 ) for the running coupling .",
    "this lattice result is obtained from an asymmetric momentum subtraction scheme .",
    "this corresponds to a definition of the running coupling @xmath29 which can explicitly be related to the present one ( @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 an inessential difference in these two definitions of the running coupling is the last factor in brackets in eq .",
    "( [ comp_rc ] ) which can be easily accounted for in comparing the different schemes . however , the crucial difference is the ratio of ghost renormalization functions @xmath34 .",
    "these considerations show that the asymmetric scheme can be extremely dangerous if infrared divergences occur in vertex functions as our calculation indicates .",
    "clearly , from the infrared enhanced ghost renormalization function this scale dependence could account for the infrared suppressed couplings which seem to be found in the asymmetric schemes .",
    "similarly , the results from the quenched calculation of the quark  gluon vertex of ref .",
    "@xcite which are compared in the right graph of fig .",
    "[ lat_alpha ] to our solution are obtained from an analogous asymmetric scheme .",
    "it is thus expected to have the same problems in taking the possible infrared divergences of the vertices into account which arise in both , the 3gluon and the quark  gluon vertex , as a result of the infrared enhancement of the ghost propagator .",
    "furthermore , definitions of the coupling which lead to extremas at finite values of the scale correspond to double valued @xmath35functions with artificial zeros . if the maxima in the couplings of the asymmetric schemes at finite scales are no lattice artifacts , these results seem to imply that the asymmetric schemes are less suited for a non  perturbative extension of the renormalization group to all scales .",
    "indeed , the results for the running coupling from the 3gluon vertex obtained for the symmetric momentum subtraction scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite differ from those of the asymmetric scheme , in particular , in the infrared .",
    "these results would be better to compare to the dse solution , however , they unfortunately seem to be much noisier thus far ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the ultimate lattice calculation to compare to the present dse coupling",
    "would be obtained from a pure qcd calculation of the ghost ",
    "gluon vertex in landau gauge with a symmetric momentum subtraction scheme .",
    "this is unfortunately not available yet .",
    ".6 cm -.6 cm 1.7 cm -.4 cm",
    "we have solved the quark dse in quenched approximation @xcite . in a first step",
    "we have specified the quark ",
    "gluon vertex from the corresponding slavnov ",
    "taylor identity .",
    "it contains explicitely a ghost renormalization function , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the curtis ",
    "pennington vertex ( for its definition see _ e.g. _",
    "it is obvious that this leads to an effective coupling very different from the one in abelian approximation , especially in the infrared : this effective coupling vanishes in the infrared and is similar to the lattice result of ref .",
    "@xcite shown in the right graph of fig .",
    "[ lat_alpha ] the main difference being that the maximum occurs at lower scale , @xmath38mev .",
    "this leads to a kernel in the quark dse which is only very slightly infrared divergent .",
    "this allows , _",
    "e.g. _ , to use the landshoff ",
    "nachtmann model for the pomeron in our approach .",
    "with our solution we obtain as pomeron intercept 2.7/gev as compared to the value 2/gev deduced from phenomenology , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "we have found dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the quenched approximation . using a current mass , @xmath39mev",
    "we obtain a constituent mass of approximately 170 mev . in the pagels",
    " stokar approximation the calculated value for the pion decay constant is 50 mev .",
    "these numbers are quite encouraging , especially for proceeding with the self  consistent inclusion of the quark dse into the gluon  ghost system .    considering the quark loop in the gluon dse one realizes that the quark loop will produce an infrared divergence which is , however , subleading as compared to the one generated by the ghost loop . in the latter there",
    "appear three ghost renormalization functions in the numerator and one in the denominator leading effectively to an infrared divergence of the order @xmath40 . in the quark loop term",
    "there is only one factor @xmath3 and thus a divergence of type @xmath41 . due to this subleading divergence",
    "the infrared analysis has to be redone completely before one is able to draw conclusions whether or not and how quark confinement is implemented in our set of truncated dses .",
    "in summary , we presented a solution to a truncated set of coupled dyson ",
    "schwinger equations for gluons and ghosts in landau gauge .",
    "the infrared behavior of this solution , obtained analytically , represents a strongly infrared enhanced ghost propagator and an infrared vanishing gluon propagator .",
    "the euclidean gluon correlation function presented here can be shown to violate reflection positivity  @xcite , which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a lehmann representation .",
    "we interpret this as representing confined gluons . in order to understand how these correlations can give rise to confinement of quarks",
    ", it will be necessary to redo the infrared analysis including self ",
    "consistently the quark propagator . nevertheless , we found dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the quenched approximation .",
    "the existence of an infrared fixed point for the coupling is in qualitative disagreement with previous studies of the gluon dse neglecting ghost contributions in landau gauge  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our results for the propagators , in particular for the ghost , compare favorably with recent lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "this shows that ghosts are important , in particular , at low energy scales relevant to hadronic observables .",
