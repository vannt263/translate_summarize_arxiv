    "hence , the quasi - particle mass in cecrge@xmath0 can be roughly estimated as m*@xmath64 45m@xmath65 , where m@xmath65 represents the free electron mass .",
    "although a band structure calculation or de haas - van alphen studies on single crystal of cecrge@xmath0 is required for a better estimate of m * , the effective mass estimated in this way was found to be very close to the experimentally observed value for rrhsi@xmath0 system ( r= la and ce ) where larhsi@xmath0 has @xmath6 = 6  mj / molk@xmath7 [ 25 ] and cerhsi@xmath0 has @xmath6 = 120  mj / molk@xmath7[26 ] .",

    "thus , the observation of a typical kondo lattice behavior in electrical resistivity and an enhanced @xmath6 value suggest that cecrge@xmath0 can be classified as a member of the heavy fermion system . the observation of heavy fermion behavior even in the presence of ferromagnetic order having large ordering temperature is remarkable in this system .    in order to obtain the ce-@xmath14 contribution to the specific heat ( c@xmath54 )",
    ", we have subtracted the heat capacity of lacrge@xmath0 from that of cecrge@xmath0 which is displayed in a plot of c@xmath66 versus @xmath3 , fig 6(b ) .",
    "the first observation is that the @xmath3 dependence of the c@xmath66 value is very flat .",
    "besides the small sharp anomaly at @xmath3 = 2.8  k there is only a weak and broad maximum at 15  k followed by a smooth decrease to higher @xmath3 , which however amount to less than 30% between 15  k and 50  k. the overall c@xmath66 value is enhanced , of the order of 120  mj / molk@xmath7 . for a stable trivalent ce@xmath24 without kondo interaction , one would expect a polarization of the ce - moment in the exchange field produced by fm ordering of cr , possibly followed by ordering of ce on its own at lower temperatures .",
    "this would result in a clear schottky anomaly due to zeeman splitting , possibly followed by a sharp anomaly , and ending in a pronounced decrease to lowest t since the ce system is then in a fully polarized state @xcite .",
    "this scenario does not fit at all to the experimental observations made here , namely , c@xmath66 remains large up to the lowest @xmath3 investigated , 0.4  k ( inset fig .",
    "6(b ) ) , much more similar to the expected behavior of the heavy fermion system .",
    "this large c@xmath66 value at lowest @xmath3 implies strong fluctuations extending down to @xmath3 = 0  k. assuming these fluctuations are due to kondo effect , c@xmath66 allows for an estimate of the kondo temperature @xmath67 using the theoretical expression derived by rajan et al @xcite @xmath68 where r is the gas constant , @xmath69 is the degeneracy of the lowest level concerned and @xmath70 is a scaling temperature which is related to the kondo temperature @xmath71 by @xmath71/@xmath70 = 1.290 .",
    "taking ground state degeneracy @xmath69 = 2 , and ( c@xmath66)@xmath72 = 0.117  j / molk@xmath7 , @xmath71 = 48  k and taking @xmath69 = 4 we get @xmath71 = 143  k.    furthermore , the @xmath14-entropy obtained from the integration of c@xmath66 increases continuously at least up to 50  k where it has reached a value close to rln2 [ fig 6(b ) ] . even above 50  k",
    "the magnetic entropy s@xmath73 continues to increase with t , this implies that the energy splitting to first excited cef level should be smaller than 150  k. however , the absence of saturation behavior towards rln2 implies that this splitting is not well defined ( resolved ) .",
    "the high @xmath71 obtained from the sommerfeld coefficient provides a first simple explanation , since a strong correlation that is responsible for high gamma value would lead to a broadening of the cef level of the same order of magnitude as the splitting .",
    "however , the exchange field due to the fm ordering of cr moments provides a further mechanism , but the exchange field needed is huge , since it has to lead to zeeman splitting of the order of 150  k. inelastic neutron scattering experiments are required to have a clear idea about the cef level scheme in this system .",

    "since we expect a relatively high kondo temperature from our specific heat measurements and additionally do not find clear signatures of the cef levels in the specific heat either , we are far from the conditions mentioned for ( c ) .",
    "indeed , it is known from theoretical calculations describing experiments e.g. on ceru@xmath9ge@xmath9 , that the temperature dependence of the thermopower can vary drastically and can even become monotonic depending on the kondo scale and the cef splitting @xcite . in the lacrge@xmath0 system",
    "we additionally find a broad hump between 30 and 60  k , which is believed to be related to the ordering of the cr moments .",
    "we have provided experimental evidence for the presence of kondo effect / heavy fermion behavior of the trivalent ce compound cecrge@xmath0 in presence of the ferromagnetic order due to itinerant cr - moments . while the conclusive evidence of the trivalent nature was obtained from xas , the presence of kondo behavior was revealed by electrical resistivity , thermoelectric power and heat capacity data .",
