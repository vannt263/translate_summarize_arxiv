    "the method of two - particle intensity interferometry was discovered in the early 1950 s by hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) @xcite who applied it to the measurement of the angular diameter of stars and other astronomical objects .",
    "then several authors  @xcite have proposed hbt studies to probe source structure in heavy ion collision .    the spirit of this method is reviewed and explained by ulrich heinz@xcite : \" two random point sources @xmath0 and @xmath1 on a distant emitter , separated by the distance @xmath2 , emit identical particles with identical energies @xmath3 which , after travelling a distance @xmath4 , are measured by two detectors 1 and 2 , separated by the distance    @xmath5 ( see figure  [ f0]a ) .",
    "@xmath4 should to be much larger than @xmath2 or @xmath6 .",
    "the total amplitude measured at detector 1 is then @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the amplitudes emitted by points @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath9 are their random phases , @xmath10 are their distances to detector 1 . for some time , the two - particle intensity correlation function is thus given by @xmath11 for large @xmath12 , the argument of the second , oscillating term becomes @xmath13 note the symmetry of this expression in @xmath6 and @xmath2 , the separations of the detectors and of the emitters.\"this symmetry is lost in the two practically relevant limits :    1 .   in case of @xmath14,the cosine - term in ( [ b5 ] ) reduces to @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   in case of @xmath17,then ( see figure  [ f0]c ) the cosine - term in ( [ b5 ] ) becomes @xmath18 .",
    "so we can get the intensity correlation function @xmath19    for a continuum of a static sources described by a distribution @xmath20 of their relative distances .",
    "the upper is deduction in theory.now let s see how to get the correlation function in experiment.@xcite``experimentally , the two - particle correlation function is obtained from the ratio @xmath21 ( normalized to unity at large @xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 is the measured two - pion distribution of pair momentum difference @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the mixed background distribution  @xcite , calculated in the same way using pairs of particles taken from different events.''note @xmath26 is the primary momentum of particle , i.e . the momentum of the particle when the particle is nearest to the source.it corresponds to the momentum when the particle leaves the source in theory .",
    "really , the variable used in correlation is a lorentz invariable @xmath27.@xcite``@xmath28''.after transforming ( [ b7 ] ) and @xmath29 into function of @xmath27,it is believed that relationship between experiment and theory is established .",
    "correlation function in ( [ b5 ] ) contains five variables @xmath30,@xmath5,@xmath31,@xmath32 and @xmath4.correlation function in ( [ b7 ] ) contains four variables @xmath5,@xmath31,@xmath32 and @xmath4 .",
    "the diminishing of @xmath30 is caused by the integral over @xmath30.the process using hbt equals the process retrievinng these variables from experiment .    in astronomy",
    ", @xmath5 is known quantity , @xmath4 can be got from other astronomical method.although measuring @xmath31 and @xmath32 is difficult , we can cancel them by integral over them that is recording all particles entering the detector in experiment.so all variables are got from experiment and hbt succeeds in astronomy .    in heavy ion collision , in order to retrieve the correlation function from experiment , these four variables @xmath5,@xmath31,@xmath32 and @xmath4 must be fixed.we can get @xmath31 and @xmath32 from detector easily.the following and last question is to get @xmath5 and @xmath4,in other words , where the position the particles are detected is .",
    "the thought that we can cancel @xmath5 and @xmath4 after the integral over them in experiment is wrong because we ca nt place point detectors throughout the space and even if we place point detectors throughout the space in ideal we still ca nt make this integral in experiment just because that particle entering the second detector after entering the first detector has changed its quantum property by the first detector so ( [ b1 ] ) becomes invalid .",
    "another opinion regarding the first point left in tpc as the position the particle be detected is also wrong because that the reconstructed track of particle is classical and the point is on this classical track , as well as ( [ b1 ] ) becomes invalid .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath4 ca nt be got from experiment , hbt ca nt be used in heavy ion collision.now let s see what we got from experiment in @xcite.the process in experiment is : firstly , determining the momentum and position of particle by the points left in detector;secondly , reversing the particle along the track , by the way the classical concept of orbit are needed , to the nearest point in the track to the source and calculating the momentum at the point;thirdly , obtaining the correlation function @xmath21 ( normalized to unity at large @xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 is the measured two - pion distribution of pair momentum difference @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the mixed background distribution  @xcite , calculated in the same way using pairs of particles taken from different events . from these process",
    "we can know the momentum used in calculating the correlation function is the momentum when particle is in the point that is nearest to the source.this point corresponds to the point in which the particle emits from the source in theory .",
    "now we can reply the question how to get @xmath5 and @xmath4,in other words , where the position the particles are detected is .in",
    "@xcite , the particles are detected on the surface of the source and @xmath4=0 , @xmath33 .",
    "so the deduction in @xcite is disabled here .",
    "now let s see what we have done in data analysis in @xcite .",
    "define @xmath34 is the emitting probability of the source where @xmath35 is polar angle and azimuth angle respectively and @xmath36 is the proper time of the source . for an event with @xmath37 particles considered,@xmath38",
    "is the number of particles whose momentum difference with the i - th particle locates @xmath39 and @xmath40,where @xmath39 is @xmath24 or @xmath41 in different cases .",
    "@xmath42 is the number of particles in other event whose momentum difference with the i - th particle locates @xmath39 and @xmath40 , it is like @xmath38 expect that @xmath42 is for different events whereas @xmath38 for same event .    for a completely random source , such as an artifical source produced by computer obeying the distribution @xmath34 of real data , it is easy to know    @xmath43    in which average is over all events . by now",
    ", it is clear that the correlation function has no direct relation with the emitting probability @xmath34 .    in real data ,",
    "if there are some mechanisms can change @xmath38 to @xmath44,whereas the sum number of particles and the distribution have not changed so @xmath45 have not changed , we can get @xmath46}{\\sum_{i=0}^m\\bar{n}_m,_i(q , q+dq)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath45 can be got from simulation by computer after knowing the distribution @xmath34.@xmath47 is a variable connecting to physical process on the surface of the source i.e. what happens when particle is produced from partons .",
    "let @xmath48,([mechanism ] ) become the result in @xcite .",
    "as what are interesting is the performance of correlation function at @xmath49,i.e .",
    "the difference of momentums is small , only this part is discussed here .",
    "the meaning of @xmath47 is the variance of number of particles whose momentum @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 from completely random distribution.if the i - th particle was produced , the probability of production of particle whose momentum is close to @xmath52 would increase.in this case @xmath53.now if the i - th particle was produced , that probability would decrease.in this case @xmath54 .",
    "let s see some mechanisms making @xmath47 positive or negative . on the surface of the source ,",
    "if a fermion is produced , it will hold a state of specified momentum and prevent particle of this kind produced after it entering this state .",
    "qualitatively,@xmath47 will become negative .",
    "interaction will also affect @xmath47.if there an attractive force between a kind of particles,@xmath47 will become positive , vice versa , attractive force leading negative @xmath47 .",
    "the most important problem in engrafting hbt from astronomy to heavy ion collision is the position where particle is detected can not correspond to corresponding variables in quondam theory.the momentum used in hbt is that when particle leave the source.at this point @xmath4=0 , @xmath33 .",
    "so the deduction is disabled for experiment .",
