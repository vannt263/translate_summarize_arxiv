    "its fibre @xmath160 is called `` a lifted milnor fibre '' .",
    "notice that in general ( and also in most of the concrete examples ) it is rather difficult to find a resolution @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , the codification of its exceptional divisors and the corresponding intersections and normal bundles can be a rather difficult problem .",
    "nevertheless , what we need from this resolution is only a 1dimensional object , the special curve arrangement :      in order to understand the special role @xmath18 plays in the geometry of the series , notice the following ( see also the comments in [ invs][wedgedef ] ) . since @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( for all @xmath164 ) , all the information that we need is in the space above @xmath165 . but @xmath166 contains the 2dimensional exceptional divisor @xmath167 as well ( a fact which is not very encouraging ) .",

    "more generally , the above algorithm contains as a particular case the construction of the resolution graph of surface singularities of type @xmath345 ( cf .",
    "part i , [ 8.1 ] ) , via the construction ( [ planecurve ] ) of @xmath16 .",
    "the interested reader can verify that for arbitrary @xmath2 ( and the same @xmath15 and @xmath16 as above ) , the graph @xmath11 is a cyclic graph as above with one @xmath350 curve and @xmath351 curves with self ",

    "the fundamental fact is that the lift of the singularity @xmath133 in @xmath139 , via the embedded resolution @xmath366 , has a distinguished position .",

    "then for sufficiently large @xmath2 @xmath369 moreover , along an irreducible component of the intersection @xmath370 , the surface @xmath368 is either smooth or forms an equisingular family of plane curve singularities . therefore , if @xmath368 is normalized , the singularities along the intersection @xmath370 are smoothed . the resulting normal surface @xmath371 has singularities only above points of @xmath372",

    "this claim needs some explanation .",
    "the first technical difficulty ( the `` easy one '' ) arises because of the fact that the dual resolution graph includes the self - intersection numbers of the exceptional curves as weights .",
    "these numbers are global invariants ( characteristic classes ) and in general , their computation is difficult .",
    "but if we consider the germ of an analytic function defined on @xmath367 , then in any embedded resolution graph of it , all the self  intersections can be computed from the multiplicities of the germ using ( part i , [ 1.3]2 ) .",

    "on the other hand , if the embedded resolution graph of @xmath8 has some additional properties ( e.g. if it is a tree and @xmath390 for all vertices @xmath391 ) , then the necessary global information can be recovered from the local one .",
    "( for more details , see part i of the paper . )    in the case of the generalized iomdin series we can ask the same question : is the global information ( i.e. the number of irreducible components of @xmath392 in @xmath371 situated above an irreducible component @xmath300 of @xmath18 in @xmath368 , or the global configuration of the intersection of these components ) codified in the local data ?",
    "the answer is _ yes _ !",
    "this follows from the results of section [ sec5 ] , where it is proven that the covering data can be determined from @xmath16",
    ". moreover , proposition ( [ unique ] ) ( cf . also part i , [ theo2 ] ) guarantees that with this covering data there is only one graph  covering . the fact which makes these claims true is that that part of @xmath18 ( namely @xmath393 ) , above which the covering is not trivial , contains only rational curves , and the dual graph of these curves has no cycles .",
    "if @xmath394 denotes the milnor fiber of a hypersurface singularity @xmath395 , and @xmath396 the topological euler  characteristic , then one has the following formula : @xmath397 where @xmath398 denoted the milnor number of the transversal singularity @xmath399 associated with @xmath71 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this formula for the `` classical case '' ( when @xmath20 is a generic linear form ) was proved by iomdin @xcite , for the general case , see @xcite .",
    "notice that both integers @xmath400 and @xmath401 can be determined from the weighted graph @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , @xmath400 is given in ( [ dj ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , theorems ( [ cts1 ] ) and ( [ cts2 ] ) provide the embedded resolution graph of @xmath399 which via a result of acampo s @xcite provides @xmath398 .      * 2 . *",
    "notice that for any vertex @xmath403 the covering data is @xmath404 , and also for any edge @xmath405 one has @xmath329 .",
    "moreover , the type of the inserted string corresponding to @xmath244 is trivial",
    ". therefore , above @xmath406 the covering is trivial , i.e. for any @xmath2 , the graph ( above ) @xmath406 stays as a stable part of the resulting graph @xmath319 or @xmath11 .    on the other hand , the graph above @xmath407 is increasing as @xmath2 becomes larger .",
    "more precisely , the number of vertices above a vertex @xmath408 is a periodical function in @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the 1edges of @xmath407 are replaced by strings which behave periodically when @xmath2 runs over the integers @xmath10 .",
    "but the 2-edges of @xmath407 are replaced by strings whose `` size '' increases infinitely as @xmath409 .",
    "basically , the union of these increasing spots , associated with the subgraphs @xmath410 ( @xmath65 ) , correspond to the `` correction term '' @xmath121 , where @xmath122 denotes the resolution graph ( cf . also with [ invs ] ) .",
    "*  not all the decorations of the weighted graph @xmath16 were used in the above algorithm . nevertheless , we believe that all of them have important geometrical significance ( we will explain this in the forthcoming paper @xcite , where we plan to discuss the relationship of @xmath16 with other invariants ) .",
    "any fault  finder reader can object the following . we constructed our resolution graph @xmath319 from the graph @xmath16 whose construction is based on some properties of the embedded resolution @xmath140 , which is a more complicated object than any resolution of @xmath133 .",
    "this is perfectly true !    but , if we consider our results as qualitative results , then already the existence of a graph @xmath16 which coordinates all the resolutions graphs @xmath411 in a purely combinatorial way ( as it is explained in the algorithm ) , and has all the properties listed in section [ sec5 ] , ( and conjecturally provides all the `` correction terms '' @xmath121 for different invariants @xmath122 such as the zeta function , signature , spectral pairs , etc . ) , is really remarkable .",

    "<S> then we present our main construction which provides the dual resolution graph of the series @xmath5 from the graph @xmath3 and the integer @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is formulated in a purely combinatorial algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a highly non - trivial generalization of the cyclic covering case of @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction .    </S>",
    "<S> the present article ( in the sequel : part ii ) is a natural continuation of @xcite ( called part i ) to such an extent that we use and cite the notations and results of part i without reviewing them . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that the sections are numbered continuously through part i and ii . )    consider an isolated complete intersection singularity ( icis ) @xmath7 such that @xmath8 has an 1dimensional singular locus . </S>",
    "<S> then construct the so called `` generalized iomdin series '' @xmath9 ( for @xmath10 ) ( see section [ sec4 ] , i.e. the first section of part ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to describe the resolution graph @xmath11 of @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the iomdin series is a generalization of the cyclic covering case @xmath13 , where @xmath8 is an isolated plane curve singularity . </S>",
    "<S> but the differences ( both technical and of principle ) are huge . </S>",
    "<S> for example , while in the case of the cyclic coverings , the relevant monodromy representations are easy ( being representations of @xmath14 ) , the monodromy representation of an icis is incomparably more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the cyclic case there is a global galois action , which disappears in the general case .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the construction of @xmath11 will show strong similarities with the case of cyclic coverings : we will construct from the icis @xmath15 a universal graph @xmath16 which will coordinate the whole series of graphs @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> already the existence of such a graph is really remarkable .    </S>",
    "<S> the construction of @xmath16 is rather involved . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that all the geometric information needed for the construction of the graphs @xmath17 is contained in a small neighborhood of a special curve arrangement @xmath18 , situated in the embedded resolution of the local divisor @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is exactly the dual graph of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we will decorate this graph with different weights , which codify the topology of the irreducible components of @xmath18 , and also the local behavior of the functions @xmath8 and @xmath20 near @xmath18 . in section [ sec5 ] </S>",
    "<S> we present this construction , some examples and also some properties of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , we will prove that from @xmath16 one can recover the resolution graph of @xmath21 , and also the equisingular type of the transversal singularities of @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> in section [ sec6 ] we present the algorithm which provides , in a purely combinatorial way , the graph @xmath11 from @xmath16 and the integer @xmath2 ( for @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the algorithm is based on the following important fact . </S>",
    "<S> the graph @xmath11 appears as a cyclic covering graph of @xmath16 ( modified with some hirzebruch  </S>",
    "<S> jung strings ) . </S>",
    "<S> the weights of @xmath16 codify all the local data from a neighborhood of @xmath18 , but a priori it is not clear that from this data one can recover the necessary global information in order to identify the covering @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> but , using the classification results of section [ sec1 ] ( part i ) , and the properties of @xmath16 , we show that the covering data of the covering can be determined from the weights of @xmath16 , and with the determined covering data there is a unique covering graph . </S>",
    "<S> this basically guarantees the vanishing of the global invariants .    </S>",
