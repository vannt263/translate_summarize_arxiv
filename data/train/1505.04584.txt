    "factorization of a large integer @xmath0 is a very difficult problem to solve with our current digital computers .",
    "indeed , divisions of @xmath0 for all its possible trial factors are costly tasks for a digital computer .",
    "algorithm @xcite is the only algorithm which so far would allow an exponential speed - up in the solution of the factoring problem by employing entanglement between quantum systems @xcite .",
    "recently different methods for factorization based on exponential sums @xcite have led to several important publications @xcite . in the first paper @xcite of this series",
    "we have described the physical principle for a generic analogue implementation of a novel factorization algorithm based on the analogue measurement of the periodicity in the maxima of continuous truncated exponential sums ( ctes ) @xcite .",
    "differently from previous factoring methods this algorithm allows the factorization of an exponential number of integers by the analogue implementation of a polynomial number of ctes interferograms where divisions of large numbers are performed by `` nature '' .",
    "is there an example of a physical system able to compute such a factoring algorithm ?",
    "the answer is yes ! divisions occur in a natural way in the wave nature of light .",
    "in fact , a wave of wavelength @xmath1 propagating over a distance @xmath2 acquires a phase @xmath3 and therefore naturally performs the ratio @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to a digital computer , division turns out to be an instantaneous task for such a physical system .",
    "a polychromatic source of light , which contains a continuous broad range of wavelengths , allows us to perform in parallel an exponential number of `` expensive '' divisions to test trial factors simultaneously .    in section ii we",
    "will describe how the ctes algorithm can be physically implemented with an `` optical computer '' based on a polychromatic source , a multi - path michelson interferometer and a spectrometer .",
    "the simultaneous factorization of an exponential number of integers will be demonstrated by suitably rescaling the wavelengths of the output optical ctes interferograms .",
    "section iii will detail the experimental realizations with our optical computer of ctes of orders @xmath5 leading to the factorization of numbers with up to seven digits .",
    "section iv and v will address , respectively , the final remarks as well as possible extensions of our optical algorithm to factoring methods with polynomial scaling .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we have demonstrated the physical computability of the ctes algorithm using an optical computer characterized by a multi - path michelson interferometer , a spectrometer and a polychromatic optical source .",
    "such an optical computer exploits destructive / constructive interference to experimentally compute the ctes optical interferograms @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ cesoptical ] ) recorded over the continuous range of wavelengths @xmath7 of the polychromatic source , with @xmath8 unit of displacement in the optical paths .",
    "the wave nature of light allows us to experimentally compute the divisions @xmath9 for all the possible wavelengths @xmath10 in the ctes optical spectrum .",
    "the information about such divisions can be extracted by measuring the periodicity in the maxima of the recorded interferogram . moreover , rescaling such a periodicity according to the relation @xmath11 allows us to infer information about the divisions @xmath12 and , thereby , about the factors of several numbers @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , for each value of @xmath0 , the factors are the integer values of @xmath11 corresponding to dominant maxima of the recorded ctes interferogram .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that an optical computer can implement prime number decomposition of an exponential number of integers @xmath13 . in particular ,",
    "the ctes factorization algorithm takes advantage of a sequence of optical interferograms @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , where each one is associated with a different value @xmath16 of the unit of displacement in the multi - path interferometer . the number @xmath17 of interferograms increases polynomially with respect to the logarithm in base @xmath18 of the largest number @xmath19 to be factored .",
    "therefore , even by exploiting a source with a wavelength bandwidth only in the visible range such that @xmath20 , it is possible to achieve a logarithmic scaling in base @xmath21 .",
    "finally , we have given a proof of principle demonstration of the physical computability of the ctes algorithm in the visible range .",
    "the factors of numbers with up to seven digits were experimentally found by using optical ctes inteferograms of order @xmath5 with @xmath22 interfering paths .",
    "we have shown , as expected , that by increasing the number @xmath23 of interfering terms and the order @xmath24 of the ctes interferogram the dominant peaks become sharper and sharper .",
    "this property can be exploited in order to better distinguish factors from non factors .",
    "our experimental results demonstrate that the ctes algorithm is not just an abstract mathematical tool but is implementable using an optical computer , which exploits the connection between physical phenomena of light interference and number theory for parallel factorization of an exponential number of integers .",
    "the described optical algorithm , in contrast to shor s method , leads to the factorization of an exponential number of integers by experimentally implementing a single sequence of a polynomial number of interferograms .",
    "however , our scheme does not allow the achievement of polynomial scaling in the number of resources as in the shor s algorithm , which instead takes advantage of entanglement between single - photon qubits in order to achieve such a goal .",
    "indeed , the largest number factorable @xmath19 is upper limited either by the value @xmath25 or @xmath26 , depending on the use of a single interferogram or a sequence of interferograms .",
    "moreover , the accuracy in the variable @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) @xmath28 associated with the trial factors of @xmath0 depends on the experimental uncertainties @xmath29 and @xmath30 associated with the measurement of the wavelengths @xmath1 and the optical path unit @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath31 also has to decrease exponentially @xcite , implying that the unit @xmath8 defining the ctes interferograms in eq .",
    "( [ cesoptical ] ) has to grow exponentially .",
    "interferometric configurations based on multiple path - reflections may be used to achieve larger values of @xmath8 .",
    "an extension of the presented algorithm based on correlation measurements in @xmath32 order interferometers may pave the way towards a new algorithm using a polynomial number of resources , thereby avoiding the requirement of exponentially large values for the optical - path unit @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", multi - photon quantum interference may serve as a powerful tool to distinguish factors from non factors .",
