    "physical oscillation is an important phenomena in physics and engineering .",
    "it is typically modeled as a linear ordinary differential equation considering the non - linear effect is negligibly small . for a system with time - independency of its physical properties ,",
    "the system is known as linear - time invariant ( lti ) system .",
    "typical examples of the lti system are dynamical oscillation in spring and in rlc circuits , both series and parallel",
    ". important properties of the system is the principle of superposition .",
    "when the lti system is given an input signal , @xmath0 as viewed in engineering , or equivalently the system is given an external driving force as viewed in physics , the differential equation of the system becomes inhomogeneous .",
    "general solution of the linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation is a sum of its complementary and particular solutions .",
    "when applying a periodic input signal , particular solution can be obtained with the help of fourier series . for arbitrary form of the input signal , the particular solution can be found with green s function method ( see , e.g. barton @xcite ) of which knowledge of initial condition of the input signal @xmath1 is necessary for solving the system .",
    "green s function of the second - order lti system is well - known and the initial input signal ( initial value of the driving force ) in the rlc system can be setup experimentally .",
    "this enables us to find particular solution for an arbitrary shape of the input signal .    in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , particle with mass @xmath2 scattered from a potential source",
    "can be described by time - independent schrdinger equation written in form of helmholtz equation .",
    "distinct aspect between the lti and the helmholtz equation is that there is a first - order derivative term ( damping term ) in the lti but not in the helmholtz equation .",
    "common aspects are such as they are second - order linear equation with source term .",
    "the source term , @xmath3 in the helmholtz equation is constructed from multiplication of the potential , @xmath4 and the wave function @xmath5 which is a general solution of the system , making @xmath3 non - designable .",
    "this is unlike the source term @xmath0 of the lti system , which could be designed or determined by experimental setup . in solving the helmholtz equation , the general solution",
    ", @xmath5 has its own boundary value embedded in itself , hence can not be solved normally .",
    "typical method of solving the problem is to employ born approximation , that is to say , finding the particular solution perturbatively . under the approximation , we do not need to know exact form of the general solution ( @xmath5 ) before hand , but instead we can approximately use the complementary solution as a general solution at the boundary , assuming the complementary solution is not much altered by the source term at the boundary .",
    "this makes the solution recursive and hence perturbative .    in this work",
    ", we present a direct usage of born approximation in the lti system given some approximation conditions for the born approximation to be valid .",
    "in addition , alternative to directly applying born approximation to the lti system , we transform the lti system into helmholtz equation form and then apply the born approximation to it .",
