    "in @xcite , colding and minicozzi introduced a notion of entropy for mean curvature flow .",
    "they define a notion of entropy stability for solitons mean curvature flow and prove its equivalence to a more computationally tractable notion of @xmath0-stability . in this context , a solution to mean curvature flow which only encounters entropy - stable singularities is said to be generic .",
    "this is in the sense that one can not perturb a stable singularity shortly before the singular time to avoid the singularity .",
    "equipped with the equivalence to @xmath1-stability , in @xcite it is proved that generic singularities to mean curvature flow are round spheres or cylinders",
    ".    inspired by that work , we aim to understand singularities of the harmonic map heat flow by studying the stability of solitons ( see definition [ solitondef ] ) . through rescaling arguments ( @xcite ) , one can produce soliton limits from singularities of the harmonic map flow , and thus understanding them is central to understanding the long time existence behavior of the flow .",
    "first we study a entropy stability condition for the harmonic map heat flow and prove its equivalence to a notion of @xmath1-stability introduced in @xcite .",
    "the relevant definitions for the statement below are found in  [ s : euclrestr ] and  [ s : entropystability ] .",
    "[ thm : main1 ] suppose @xmath2 is a non - cylindrical soliton with polynomial energy density growth",
    ". then @xmath3 is @xmath1-unstable if and only if there is a compactly supported variation @xmath4 such that @xmath5 and for all @xmath6 one has @xmath7    the notion of @xmath0-stability is a more tractable notion involving the spectrum of a certain kind of second variation operator associated to the the entropy functional ( see ( [ lfdef ] ) ) . given this , one would like to simplify the task of testing for stability further by obtaining a characterization in terms of rayleigh quotients .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 in the statement below is the infimum of the relevant rayleigh quotient ( see definition [ mudefn ] ) , which , due to the noncompactness of the domain , may equal @xmath9 .",
    "[ thm : rayleigh ] suppose @xmath10 is a soliton with polynomial energy density growth .",
    "if @xmath11 then @xmath3 is @xmath0-unstable .    given the equivalence between @xmath12-stability and @xmath1-stability , we then consider the problem of classifying @xmath12-stable solutions into various target spaces by studying @xmath1-stability via the rayleigh quotient @xmath8 .",
    "we first note that in principle one should expect a large variety of stable solitons for the harmonic map flow .",
    "in particular , as shown in @xcite , given @xmath13 , for any homotopically non - trivial class in @xmath14 there is an @xmath15 such that any @xmath16 in the class with the energy below @xmath17 is the initial condition for a heat flow which goes singular in finite time , leading to soliton blowup models which should be stable . on the other hand",
    "the entropy of these solutions can not be too small due to the @xmath18-regularity results of struwe @xcite .",
    "our result gives a uniform upper bound for the entropy of stable solitons mapping into the sphere , complementing these results .",
    "[ thm : main2 ] suppose @xmath19 is an entropy stable soliton . then @xmath20    to prove theorem [ thm : main2 ] we first use the equivalence between entropy stability and @xmath0-stability provided by theorem [ thm : main1 ] .",
    "we then construct test variation fields for the @xmath0-stability condition using conformal vector fields on the sphere .",
    "we can not directly show the existence of negative eigenvectors in the space of conformal vector fields and so instead we rely on theorem [ thm : rayleigh ] .",
    "the use of conformal vector fields in understanding stability of harmonic maps into spheres is classical , see @xcite .",
    "lastly , we observe results relating entropy stability and @xmath0-stability to a kind of `` dimensional instability '' for harmonic map heat flow . taking a cue from classical results",
    "we show in proposition [ prop : solitonintospheres ] that any nonconstant soliton whose image is contained in a great sphere is entropy unstable .",
    "the vector field exhibiting instability is the conformal vector field with poles at the vectors orthogonal to the given great sphere .",
    "this suggests that , in studying harmonic maps into spheres , at a singular time one could embed the map into a sphere of one higher dimension as a great sphere , and then perturb the map into the extra dimension to remove the unstable singularity .",
    "as it turns out this strategy is successful , and any map landing strictly in a hemisphere admits a smooth long time solution to harmonic map flow .",
    "a well - known result of gordon @xcite says that any harmonic map into a region admitting a convex function is constant .",
    "we show a related result which says that if a map has image contained in a sublevel set of a boundary - defining convex function , the solution to harmonic map flow with this initial condition exists smoothly for all time and converges to a point .",
    "lin - wang show results of this kind , and indeed our result is effectively a corollary of ( @xcite theorem 5.4.3 ) .",
    "we require a little bit of care , as the results of lin - wang implicitly assume completeness of the target , which is not satisfied in our setting .",
    "indeed , we provide examples in  [ s : dimaug ] that various natural statements about harmonic map flow with convex target are false .",
    "these issues are resolved by observing a parabolic maximum principle which shows that sublevel sets of boundary - defining convex functions are preserved under harmonic map flow .",
    "[ ltethm ] let @xmath21 be a compact riemannian manifold , and suppose @xmath22 is a compact riemannian manifold with boundary which is a sublevel set of a strictly convex boundary - defining function .",
    "given @xmath23 a smooth map , the solution to harmonic map heat flow with initial condition @xmath3 exists for all time and converges to a point .",
    "this theorem in particular implies the result mentioned above that maps into hemispheres admit long time solutions to harmonic map flow which converge to points .",
    "this suggests a different way to move past singularities for maps into spheres , by perturbing into a hemisphere of a sphere of one dimension higher .",
    "moreover , this result motivates some conjectures about the structure of solitons mapping into spheres by perturbing the maps into a hemisphere of one dimension higher and studying the behavior of the flow at infinity .",
    "this is discussed in ",
    "[ ss : conjs ] .    here is an outline of the rest of the paper . in ",
    "[ s : ffunctentropy ] we record some fundamental properties of the @xmath0-functionals and entropy . in  [ s : euclrestr ] refine these results in the case of a euclidean source .",

    "[ s : stabilityrigidity ] we give stability and rigidity results for solitons , focusing on the sphere and leading to theorem [ thm : main2 ] .",

    "there one only considers weighting against gaussian densities with different basepoints in @xmath57 .",
    "this suffices for the purposes of understanding singularity models in both cases .",
    "we have generalized this to a more flexible entropy functional more akin to perelman s ricci flow entropy @xcite , now defined on arbitrary riemannian manifold by allowing weighting against arbitrary probability measures .",

    "moreover , the critical points of @xmath58 are exactly self shrinking solutions .",
    "the primary disadvantage of @xmath58 is that it does not depend smoothly on @xmath59 .",
