    "radiatively driven mass loss plays an important role in determining the properties of the circumstellar environment , and is also expected to have a significant impact on the subsequent evolution of the star itself .",
    "predominantly important in massive stars , the radiatively driven stellar winds are an important factor in determining the course of evolution and final end state of the star . however , many massive stars are known to be rapidly rotating , which produces variation in the flux and effective temperature over the stellar surface .",
    "this variation in turn , will affect the temperature dependent mass loss rates , producing latitudinally dependent stellar winds ( see , for example * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the effects of rotation on stellar mass loss rates can greatly influence the later evolution of a star through angular momentum loss @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important for us to understand how exactly mass loss rates depend on rotation , and the subsequent effects on evolution .",
    "in general , the effects of stellar rotation on wind profiles are not well understood .",
    "research into this problem is still in its infancy , and the results can be highly contested .",
    "several studies have shown that at very high rotation rates , the wind can switch to a slower , denser equatorial outflow @xcite , which may explain the observed disks around b[e ] stars .",
    "however , other groups find that when the effects are modelled in 2d , the opposite is true , and the wind density is higher at the pole than the equator @xcite .",
    "however , in this work , we focus instead on how rotation affects the mass loss rates from the surface of the star , and the implications these mass loss rates have for the structure and evolution of the star , rather than the winds .",
    "early investigations into latitudinally dependent mass loss suggested that the reduction in effective gravity near the equator would produce an enhancement in the equatorial density @xcite .",
    "the increase in mass lost at the equator would carry away more angular momentum , and the star would spin down faster . however , these results assumed the flux to be constant across the surface of the star .",
    "when the effects of gravity darkening are taken into account , ( using , e.g. , von zeipel s law , ) the opposite was found to be true , and the star was found to lose most of it s mass from the polar regions @xcite . in this case , the star will spin down more slowly , which could lead to relatively rapidly rotating stars in later phases of evolution , such as the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) or wolf - rayet ( wr ) phases .",
    "a change in the mass loss rate will change the amount of angular momentum lost from a star , causing it to spin down differently .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , massive stars can lose mass and angular momentum quickly enough to prevent the star reaching its critical rotation velocity on the main sequence . as a result",
    ", lower mass stars with lower mass loss rates would end their main sequence lives as more rapid rotators than higher mass stars . at the end of the main sequence",
    ", low mass rapidly rotating stars may reach the critical velocity as angular momentum is dredged up from the core . at the critical velocity , these stars would lose significant amounts of mass from the equator .",
    "this could explain why extremely rapidly rotating stars , such as be stars are not seen among the more massive o stars @xcite .",
    "the interaction between mass loss and angular momentum would also explain the relative frequency of be stars in the lmc and smc . at lower metallicity ,",
    "the mass loss rates are typically lower , so stars in the lmc and smc may be able to continue to rotate faster , and are hence more likely to form be stars @xcite .",
    "a recent study by @xcite considers the effects of anisotropic winds on the evolution of a rotating star . using the roche approximation to determine the shape of the surface equipotential",
    ", they find that as the rotation rate increases , more mass is lost from the pole . at high rotation rates , the difference in flux between the pole and equator becomes quite large , with the flux at the pole more than twice the flux at the equator when the rotation rate is greater than 0.8 @xmath0 . using a semi - analytical approach , when anisotropic effects are taken into account , the angular momentum loss changes by less than 4 % compared to isotropic winds for rotation rates up to 0.9 @xmath0 , and",
    "the subsequent effects on the stellar evolution are expected to be small . using more realistic mass loss rates",
    "there is basically no change in the angular momentum loss until @xmath1 @xmath2 0.4 . at this point ,",
    "the star becomes sufficiently rapidly rotating to significantly reduce the temperature of the equatorial regions , which produces a strong equatorial mass loss in the anisotropic case @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the latitudinal distribution of mass loss is also important for understanding the structure of the surrounding nebulae .",
    "the shape of the circumstellar nebulae may also have an effect on supernovae light curves @xcite .",
    "early studies suggested that if the mass loss in a rotating star is primarily radial , the material carried away could lead to the formation of a wind compressed disk ( wcd , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , more recent research including the non - radial components of the wind have shown that this flow inhibits the formation of a wcd , and may be more likely to produce a polar nebulae @xcite .",
    "the effects of rotation on stellar winds are still very uncertain , with simulations finding polar density enhancements @xcite or equatorial density enhancements @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms may be important in different stages of stellar evolution , as observations of b[e ] stars are thought to be explained by a dense equatorial wind @xcite , while nebulae around lbvs are often bipolar , as is seen around @xmath3 carinae .",
    "asymmetric mass loss produced by rotation may be able to explain the structure of some of these nebulae .",
    "global effects of rotation on mass loss have been investigated by several authors .",
    "@xcite found that the mass loss rate of a star at a given location in the hr diagram increases with increasing rotation rate .",
    "this effect has been confirmed observationally @xcite , and has also been found in models by @xcite .",
    "this relationship between mass loss and rotation rate can be described by a simple equation ( eg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath4 for a star at constant temperature and luminosity . the exponent @xmath5 is usually taken to be @xmath2 0.43 . according to this equation ,",
    "the enhancement of the mass loss rate due to rotation is modest , only a factor of 2 for @xmath6 = 0.8 .",
    "formally , this formula leads to infinite mass loss rates at critical rotation velocities , so this scaling law breaks down at very high rotation rates .",
    "it is this formula that is used to calculate the effects of rotation on mass loss in many stellar evolution codes ( eg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the rotational enhancement of mass loss described above can be even more important in stars that are already close to the eddington limit . in this case , for a star rotating at a given angular velocity @xmath6 , equation [ eqn:1dscale ] can be rewritten to include the effects of the eddington luminosity as : @xmath7^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}-1}}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the average density inside a given surface , and @xmath9 is one of the force multiplier parameters . in this case , the mass loss rate depends on both the rotation rate and the eddington factor , a situation known as the @xmath10 limit @xcite . in extreme cases , with @xmath11 ,",
    "even moderate rotation can cause the denominator to vanish , leading to infinite mass loss rates .",
    "@xcite show that the ratio @xmath12 can be quite moderate for stars up to 40 m@xmath13 , but can become large for stars above 60 m@xmath13 , and can start to diverge for stars close to the humphreys - davidson limit .",
    "despite recent progress , there is still much to be discovered on the interaction between stellar winds and rotation . scaling laws , such as those used in equations [ eqn:1dscale ] and [ eqn : eddington ] are derived for stars at constant temperature and luminosity , but both of these quantities change as the rotation rate increases .",
    "current 1d and pseudo-2d models do not fully account for the distortion of the surface and variation in temperature , making realistic calculations of the anisotropy in the mass loss and angular momentum loss rates suspect",
    ". a more realistic calculation of these quantities could produce significant discrepancies compared to current stellar evolution models .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the stellar mass loss rates for fully 2d stellar structure calculations , addressing many of the issues discussed above .",
    "we consider two different mass loss prescriptions , and compare the 2d results to 1d calculations and scaling laws . in this way",
    ", we can directly calculate the distribution of mass loss , and its effect on angular momentum loss and the evolution of the star .    in section [ sec :",
    "models ] , we discuss the 2d stellar structure models used in this work . in section [ results ]",
    "we compare our 2d calculations to the mass loss rates and angular momentum loss rates in 1d models . in section [ rates ]",
    "we discuss the effect of rotation on the global mass loss rates of stellar models , and present scaling relations derived at constant mass .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and discuss future work in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the stellar models used here were calculated using the 2d stellar structure code rotorc @xcite .",
    "the code uses the opal opacities @xcite and equation of state @xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider zams models of 20 , 30 and 40 m@xmath13 , with x = 0.7 and z = 0.02 . these models",
    "solve the conservation equations of mass , momentum , energy and hydrogen abundance , along with poisson s equation for the gravitational potential on a two - dimensional finite difference grid with the fractional surface equatorial radius and the colatitude as the independent variables .",
    "this grid contains 581 radial zones and 10 angular zones . simultaneously with the conservation equations , we solve the integral of the density over the model , and set the surface equatorial radius such that the result equals the total mass of the model .",
    "the surface is assumed to be an equipotential determined by the equatorial gravitational potential .",
    "the models , summarized in table [ models ] , are uniformly rotating zams models , with velocities equal to 0 , 0.3 , 0.5 and 0.7 @xmath0 .

    "are curves for models rotating at 550 @xmath14  and 200 @xmath14 . ]    as expected , as the rotation rate of a model increases , the rate of angular momentum loss increases as well , as illustrated in figure [ fig : angrate ] .",
    "however , at higher rotation rates the total angular momentum of the models also increases . for each model and mass loss rate , we calculated the ratio of the local rate of angular momentum loss to the total angular momentum loss ( @xmath15 ) . for a given model",
    ", this quantity is relatively constant as rotation rate increases , as shown in figure [ fig : scaled ] for the 20 m@xmath13  model .",
    "this is true for any given model , but different masses and mass loss prescriptions scale differently , making it difficult to derive a simple scaling law to describe the angular momentum loss . in more rapidly rotating and more massive models ,",
    "there is more variation in mass loss near the equator , so the fractional rate of angular momentum loss does decrease as the rotation rate increases .",
    "this is particularly true for the v01 models , while the k89 models show a more consistent scaling .",
    "rate of angular momentum loss calculated in 2d for a 20 m@xmath13  model using the k89 ( top ) and v01 ( bottom ) mass loss rates .",

    "angular momentum loss was calculated using the k89 ( top ) and v01 ( bottom ) mass loss rates . ]",
    "the current paradigm for stellar mass loss uses equation [ eqn:1dscale ] to scale mass loss rates with stellar rotation for stars at constant luminosity and effective temperature . as discussed in section [ intro ] , this effect has been seen observationally @xcite , although the magnitude of the effect appears to be somewhat uncertain , ranging from a few tens of percent to two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , stellar models use mass as the independent variable , and the luminosity and effective temperature are allowed to vary .    calculations of fully 2d rotating stars indicate that the situation may be more complicated , and equation [ eqn:1dscale ] may be used incorrectly in some situations .",
    "we find that for models at constant mass , the overall mass loss rates _ decrease _ as the rotation rate increases , as shown in figure [ time ] for 20 m@xmath13  models . as the rotation rate increases ,",
    "the effective temperature and luminosity also decrease , as shown in table [ models ] , which leads to lower mass loss rates in all cases .",
    "the decrease is about 0.06 dex for the k89 rates , and about 0.15 dex for the v01 rates . at 30 and 40",
    "m@xmath13 , the decrease is between 0.03 - 0.05 dex for all three rates , although these models do not extend to as rapid rotation as the 20m@xmath13  models .",

    "the mass loss rates predicted by the scaling law given in eqn [ eqn:1dscale ] are shown by the dashed curves . ]    as discussed above , the scaling law in eqn [ eqn:1dscale ] applies to stars at _ constant luminosity and effective temperature _ , but is often applied to models with the same mass at different rotation rates even though the rotation changes t@xmath16 and l. the mass loss rates discussed here are held at constant mass , while the effective temperature and luminosity are allowed to vary .",
    "this makes more sense from a stellar modelling stand point as in most evolution codes , models are made at a given mass , and the effective temperature and luminosity are allowed to vary as the rotation rate changes . for those who wish to implement a mass dependent scaling law ,",
    "we have found linear fits to our 2d calculations . for the v01 models",
    ", the mass loss rate can be fit linearly in the mass and the square of the ratio of the surface equatorial rotation velocity to the critical velocity ( ( @xmath17)@xmath18 ) : @xmath19 the k89 rates are more complicated . at any given mass , the mass loss rate can be fit linearly as a function of @xmath20 , but the slope of the line varies with mass . with only three points ,",
    "it is difficult to produce a reliable fit , although the result is clearly not linear .",
    "we present here fits at each mass individually : @xmath21 where @xmath22 = -0.148 at 20 m@xmath13 , -0.221 at 30 m@xmath13  and -0.123 at 40 m@xmath13 .      as discussed in section [ massresults ] ,",
    "one of the consequences of rotation is to produce a variation in temperature across the surface of the star , which causes the mass loss rates to vary as well .",
    "based on the cak mass loss formalism , the mass loss rate at any given colatitude in a rotating star can be written relative to the polar values , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 : @xmath26^{1/\\alpha}\\left[\\frac{g_{eff}(\\theta)}{g_o}\\right]^{1 - 1/\\alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is taken to be independent of latitude and @xmath27 is the centrifugally reduced surface gravity @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xcite . combining this equation with the @xcite gravity darkening",
    "shows that @xmath30 , and hence the mass loss rate decreases towards the equator @xcite .",
    "this is expected to produce bipolar outflows around rotating stars . using our 2d stellar models ,",
    "we can test the efficacy of this scaling law approximation .",
    "the difference between the 1d predictions and the 2d calculations for mass loss rate across the surface of a rotating star is shown in figure [ fig:20m2d ] for a 20 m@xmath13  model rotating at 200 and 550 @xmath14and in figure [ fig:40m2d ] for a 40 m@xmath13  model .",
    "we have scaled the mass loss rates predicted by equation [ eqn:2dscale ] so that the total mass loss is the same . in all cases ,",
    "the 1d scaling law over predicts the amount of mass loss from the equatorial regions , and under predicts the mass loss from the polar regions .",
    "the differences between the v01 models and the 1d predictions are typically larger than the k89 rates by a factor of 2 . in the most rapidly rotating model ( 20 m@xmath13 , v = 550 @xmath14 ) ,",
    "the v01 mass loss rates are 100 % smaller than the 1d predictions at the equator . for most models , typical variations for all mass loss rates",
    "are between 10 - 20 % larger at the pole and smaller at the equator .    the relative difference between the 2d calculation and the 1d prediction for mass loss rate from a 20 m@xmath13  model rotating at 200 ( top ) and 550 @xmath14  ( bottom panel)as a function of colatitude for the k89 ( solid ) and v01 ( dashed ) mass loss rates .",

    "the 1d prediction is scaled such that the total mass loss is the same in both cases . ]",
    "most of the difference between the 1d and 2d models can be accounted for by differences between the temperatures predicted by von zeipel s law @xcite and the temperatures calculated in our models , which are typically in the range of 10 % @xcite .",
    "the remaining difference arises from the assumptions used in deriving equation [ eqn:2dscaleb ] . in reality , the force multiplier parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are all functions of temperature and luminosity . in equation [ eqn:2dscaleb ] however , @xmath9 is taken to be independent of latitude , and only the effective gravity varies across the surface . in our models , @xmath9 is nearly independent of temperature , and so we also assume @xmath9 to be constant .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath31 , is also approximately constant over the range of temperatures considered here .",
    "however , the third line force parameter , @xmath32 , is strongly dependent on temperature .",
    "this dependence on temperature , which is not accounted for in the 1d scaling relation , will increase the variation between pole and equator in fully 2d mass loss rates .",
    "two different prescriptions for radiatively driven mass loss rates were added to the 2d stellar evolution code rotorc @xcite .",
    "we used ( 1 ) a modification of the original theoretical description which includes the finite disk approximation by @xcite and ( 2 ) mass loss rates based on monte carlo simulations by @xcite .",
    "either of these mass loss prescriptions can be used to calculate the mass loss using the local properties across the surface of a rotating star , or using the global properties to give a pseudo-1d calculation of the mass loss .",
    "we considered the total mass lost from rotating stars using our models .",
    "we found that as the rotation rate increases , the mass loss rate decreases for any given mass .",
    "as rotation increases the effective temperature and luminosity of the star decreases , which decreases the mass loss rate .",
    "this effect goes in the opposite direction of the commonly used scaling relation given in equation [ eqn:1dscale ] .",
    "however , this equation is derived , both theoretically and observationally , for stars held at _ constant temperature and luminosity _ , which is not the case when comparing stars of the same mass and increasing rotation rate . in equations [ eqn : vinkfit ] and [ eqn : cakfit ] , we provide scaling relations for mass loss rates as a function of rotation rate for stars at constant mass .    using our 2d models",
    ", we investigated the variation in mass loss rate across the surface of a rotating star .",
    "a direct comparison of our pseudo-1d and 2d calculations show that the total angle integrated amount of mass lost is not significantly affected , but a full 2d calculation dramatically changes the distribution of mass lost . as our models do not assume von zeipel s law holds , we can provide an independent verification of the scaling relation based on the cak theory and von zeipel s law @xcite commonly used in 1d models .",
    "we have found that the von zeipel models predict a smaller range of mass loss rates from the pole to equator than our 2d models , with typical differences of 10 - 20 % at the pole and equator .",
    "the difference between the 2d and pseudo-1d model can mostly be explained by differences between our surface temperature structure and that predicted by von zeipel s law , with the remaining differences a result of allowing the force multiplier parameters to vary with co - latitude in our 2d models .",
    "the change in distribution of the mass loss also affects the angular momentum loss from these models . in general",
    ", the 2d models predict a lower rate of mass loss at the equator than the pseudo-1d models , for which the mass loss rate is constant across the surface .",
    "although the total rate of angular momentum loss increases as the rotation rate increases , the fraction of the total angular momentum lost is approximately constant for a given mass and mass loss prescription . however , the scaling changes dramatically with mass and mass loss prescription , so it does not seem that a straightforward scaling relation can be derived .",
    "as the 2d models presented here lose less angular momentum , they should be expected to spin down more slowly than 1d models .",
    "this could produce one of two effects .",
    "the first possibility is that these models will lose more mass at the pole and remain rapidly rotating through later stages of evolution .",
    "the second possibility is that these models would maintain a rotation rate high enough to reach the critical velocity sooner in the evolution and lose a significant amount of mass ( and hence angular momentum ) at the equator . in a future paper",
    ", we will investigate how the 2d mass and angular momentum loss affect the evolution of these stars .",
