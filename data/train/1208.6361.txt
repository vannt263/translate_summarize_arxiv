    "searching for new forms of matter is a fundamental quest . in the standard model s strong interaction sector described by the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,",
    "various forms of qcd matter may exist in nature , e.g. , inside the compact stars and in the early universe a few microseconds after the `` big bang '' .",
    "studying the `` condensed matter physics of qcd '' has been essential for advancing our understanding of matter and the qcd dynamics as well . a highly nontrivial prediction based on the salient feature of qcd ,",
    "the asymptotic freedom @xcite , is that we shall expect a new , deconfined , and weakly coupled phase of qcd matter at asymptotically high temperature@xcite .",
    "a deconfinement transition at certain temperature @xmath2 and a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase above @xmath2 @xcite are expected and have been extensively studied using lattice qcd simulations .",
    "experimentally , such hot qcd matter has been created in the heavy ion collisions ( `` little bang '' ) , with its many properties measured in the past decade at rhic @xcite and now also at lhc @xcite .",
    "the era of rhic plus lhc provides unique opportunities for uncovering the underlying structures of the hot deconfined qcd matter and deepening our understanding of how qcd operates in a strongly interacting many - body setting .",
    "various major findings at rhic ( with auau collisions up to @xmath3 ) coherently hint at a strongly coupled qgp ( sqgp ) @xcite above but close to @xmath2 .",
    "this is drastically different from the naively expected `` asymptotically free matter '' ( afm ) . while a full microscopic picture of the sqgp is yet to come ,",
    "there have been important progresses suggesting that the qcd plasma near @xmath2 is an emergent matter dominated by dense and light ( chromo-)magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "these thermal monopoles are peculiar to the region above but close to @xmath2 , and their condensation at @xmath2 marks the onset of confinement . with lhc colliding pbpb at @xmath4 now ( and @xmath5 in the future ) , and thus creating an even hotter qgp with much higher density , it is tempting to ask : if the sqgp at rhic bears peculiar near-@xmath2 nature , is that quickly turned off at lhc with noticeable changes in the qgp properties ( the qgp at lhc is further away from @xmath2 ) , and how much closer is the qgp at lhc to the afm ? this paper attempts to extract insights into these questions by studying the hard probe of the medium geometry and its fluctuations at both collision energies .",
    "just like the x - ray imaging of normal materials , the highly energetic partons produced in the initial binary hard collisions provide natural imaging tools to study the qgp matter .",
    "such a partonic jet , carrying an energy much higher than the medium energy scale , could experience multiple collisions with medium constituents and lose its energy significantly ( i.e. , jet quenching ) @xcite . as a result",
    "the hadron production from the jet will differ from the case without medium effects ( e.g. , in the proton - proton collision at the same energy ) .",
    "measuring such difference is a useful way of learning about the medium s properties and the jet - medium interactions . a conventional observable to quantify the jet quenching is the nuclear modification factor @xmath6 defined as : @xmath7 where in the denominator the nuclear overlap function @xmath8 scales up single nucleon - nucleon(nn ) cross section to the nucleus - nucleus(aa ) one according to the expected binary nn collision number .",
    "thus a value of @xmath6 smaller ( larger ) than unity means suppression ( enhancement ) due to medium effect . for the jet quenching physics , we focus on the @xmath6 measured for detected hadrons with large enough transverse momenta ( e.g. @xmath9 for rhic and @xmath10 for lhc ) and for @xmath11 at mid - rapidity ( as per most detectors )",
    ". the @xmath12 is the azimuthal angle of the measured hadron s transverse momentum .",
    "one may examine the @xmath6 either integrated or differential in @xmath12 .    a significant suppression of high-@xmath13 hadron production",
    "was first observed at rhic , with @xmath6 reaching about @xmath14 in the most central collisions .",
    "measurements of charged particle , identified hadron , heavy flavor production , photon production , triggered di - hadron correlations have coherently pointed to a medium that is extremely opaque to `` colored '' hard probe . for reviews",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "new and extensive lhc data on various hard probe observables have shown similar strong jet quenching @xcite , and the apt question is whether the hotter medium becomes less opaque or not ( in the context that medium density roughly doubles ) .",
    "a very powerful idea in the jet quenching study is the so - called geometric tomography @xcite .",
    "the created hot medium is generally anisotropic in the transverse plane ( perpendicular to the collision beam axis ) , and therefore high energy partons traversing the medium along different azimuthal directions will `` see '' different medium thickness and thus lose different amount of energy . that will lead to a measurable anisotropy in @xmath15 .",
    "it is well - known that the dominant geometric anisotropy is the elliptic component @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 related to matter anisotropy axis ) and the coefficient is the @xmath18 for high @xmath13 hadrons . a lot of studies @xcite have shown that such geometric observable is very sensitive to the underlying jet energy loss dynamics e.g. , its dependence on the in - medium path length .",
    "comprehensive studies in @xcite have also shown its highly constraining power , and used it to rule out a wide class of models , leaving only a few cases with a certain hydrodynamical background that may be consistent with data .",
    "more recently the idea has been extended to systematically quantify the jet response to the geometrical anisotropy arising from the strong fluctuations in the initial condition of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "a number of studies on jet quenching azimuthal anisotropy at rhic ( specified by high-@xmath13 @xmath18 ) , however , have shown a clear discrepancy between various model results and the phenix data with @xmath13 extending to @xmath19 @xcite till around 2008 .",
    "previous jet quenching models , with either linear or the lpm - induced quadratic  @xcite path - length dependence , under - predicted the high-@xmath13 @xmath18 by a significant amount ( often by a factor of 2 ) , although they can reproduce the overall opaqueness in terms of @xmath12-integrated @xmath6 .",
    "efforts toward reconciling @xmath6 and @xmath18 at high @xmath13 fostered a more radical proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite , which breaks the assumption ( taken for granted in all previous considerations ) that the energy loss is simply proportional to plasma constituent density ( e.g. as per entropy density @xmath20 ) . instead , the key insight of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the jet - medium interaction has a non - trivial dependence on matter density and particularly is strongly enhanced in the near-@xmath2 region . such enhancement , in analogy with the well - known `` critical opalescence '' , is well motivated by the aforementioned emergence of magnetic monopoles in the same region @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically this model for the first time achieved a simultaneous description of @xmath6 and @xmath18 at high @xmath13 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the effect of the near-@xmath2 enhancement on the jet quenching anisotropy is robust and generic : similar successes were reported by incorporating this enhancement in a variety of different approaches for jet quenching @xcite .    for a more concrete discussion on the path - length dependence and matter - density dependence of jet quenching ,",
    "let us adopt here the geometric models that have been widely used and successful in describing the gross features of jet quenching @xcite .",
    "in such a model one assumes that the final energy @xmath21 of a jet with initial energy @xmath22 after traveling an in - medium path @xmath23 ( specified by the jet initial spot and momentum direction ) can be parameterized as @xmath24 with the @xmath25 given by @xmath26\\ , s(l)\\ , l^m dl   \\right\\ } \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath27 is the local entropy density along the jet path , while the @xmath28 represents the local jet - medium interaction strength which as a property of underlying matter depends on the local density @xmath27 .",
    "we choose to explicitly separate out the density @xmath20 itself , and the combination @xmath29 approximately corresponds to @xmath30 in many jet quenching models .",
    "different choices of @xmath31 and @xmath28 mean different path - length and matter - density dependences , and here we consider three classes of models . the near-@xmath2 enhancement ( ntce ) model as in refs .",
    "@xcite is implemented by assuming @xmath32 ( i.e. quadratic ) and introducing a strong jet quenching component in the vicinity of @xmath2 ( with density @xmath33 and span of @xmath34 ) via @xmath35 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the details . ) for contrast , we also consider two other classes of models that both assume @xmath39 being a constant independent of density , while have @xmath32 and @xmath40 respectively , referred to as @xmath41 and @xmath42 models hereafter .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 controls the overall opaqueness in each of the three models and will be fixed by @xmath44 in the @xmath45 collisions at rhic @xmath3 .",
    "the fraction energy loss formula employed here gives a @xmath46 independent @xmath6 .",
    "[ raa_comparison ] shows our @xmath6 results for both rhic ( @xmath47 tev ) and lhc ( @xmath48 tev ) .",
    "the data are from both rhic @xcite and lhc @xcite .",
    "see the detailed discussion about this in sec .",
    "[ sec : hp ] .",
    "the @xmath49 model represents the generic feature of most radiative energy loss models with lpm effect , while the @xmath50 model is motivated by certain energy loss calculations for strongly coupled yang - mills plasma based on the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning , though , that at rhic it turns out the @xmath50 model is also able to describe @xmath18 at high @xmath13 @xcite ( also see fig .",
    "[ v2_comparison ] ) .",
    "the reason may be that the @xmath50 dependence effectively enhances the later time quenching which mimics the similar effect from the near-@xmath2 enhancement .",
    "therefore further discrimination between the two models is needed and lhc test is crucial .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as the follows .",
    "the next section will cover first a description of our event - by - event analysis , and then our major results on high-@xmath13 anisotropy for both rhic and lhc energies .",
    "comparisons with available data will also be provided there .",
    "for the details of our calculations and results , please see ref .",
    "this report is then ended with a short summary .",
    "here we report the first event - by - event quantification of the azimuthal anisotropy in jet quenching due to both geometry and fluctuations at both rhic and lhc energies .",
    "in particular we will show results for @xmath18 at high @xmath13 from all three geometric models including the ntce , @xmath41 and @xmath42 models , and compare them with data .    in general for a given event ,",
    "there are strong initial fluctuations in both the participant density profile ( which dominates the soft matter density distribution ) and the collision density profile ( which dominates the jet spot distribution ) .",
    "the jet quenching anisotropy comes from the convolution of both , and the resulting @xmath15 can be evaluated on an event - by - event basis as follows : @xmath51 where @xmath52 means averaging over all jet paths with azimuthal orientation @xmath12 and including all the possible initial jet production spots ( distributed according to the binary collision density in the same event ) .",
    "we notice that there are fluctuations of energy loss even for a given path @xmath53 as demonstrated in e.g.  @xcite : such fluctuations may likely weaken the jet response to geometric anisotropy and will be studied in the future .",
    "the exponent @xmath54 comes from reference p - p spectrum at the same collision energy : @xmath55 for @xmath56 tev ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the second harmonic @xmath18 is the most robust and reflects the hard probe of the anisotropic geometry , while other ( odd ) harmonics are strongly affected by the initial state fluctuations and provide further insights into the initial conditions in addition to what have been learned from the bulk collective expansion dynamics @xcite .    to perform a event - by - event simulation ,",
    "we have used the standard monte - carlo glauber model to generate fluctuating initial conditions @xcite and followed most hydrodynamics literature to set the relevant implementation procedures and parameters @xcite . the nn cross section @xmath61 is set as @xmath62 for @xmath63 . with calculated participant density @xmath64 and binary collision density @xmath65 in the transverse plane , the initial entropy density at equilibrium time @xmath66 ( assumed the same for different energies ) is scaled with @xmath64 at rhic , and @xmath67 at lhc ( @xmath68 for both @xmath48 and @xmath69 tev cases ) .",
    "the proportionality constants are determined from the multiplicities at different energies @xcite .",
    "energy loss in the pre - equilibrium stage is quite possible but quantitatively uncertain , and may be improved in the future with developing understanding of the thermalization process @xcite .",

    "such a difference is visible albeit smallish . with the present accuracy of data and modeling",
    ", it may be difficult to draw firm conclusions solely upon it .",

    ", however , one immediately sees that too strong a path - length dependence ( i.e. the @xmath42 model ) is ruled out , while both the ntce and @xmath41 models agree with data .",

    "we ve found that too strong a path - length dependence ( e.g. cubic ) is ruled out by data at lhc , while the model with strong near-@xmath2 enhancement of jet - medium interaction fully describes data at both collision energies .",

    "while many other factors in modeling jet energy loss @xcite also influence the jet azimuthal anisotropy and its evolution with collision energy , this study demonstrates these two s particular sensitivity to the path - length and matter - density dependences of jet energy loss .",
    "further improvements ( e.g. including energy dependence , integration with realistic hydrodynamic modeling , incorporating the ntce component with other jet quenching schemes , etc ) are underway and will be reported in the future .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again that the near-@xmath2 enhancement model implies a strong decrease of jet - medium interaction at hotter temperature ; it expects a less color - opaque medium at lhc despite only modest temperature increase from rhic @xcite .",
    "consistent messages have been reported recently from a variety of independent jet quenching studies @xcite .",
    "the underlying picture of emergent magnetic plasma near @xmath2 implies a more rapid running of coupling than what would be expected from perturbative picture as demonstrated in @xcite ; this seems to be consistent with the noticeable reduction of jet - medium coupling @xcite resulting from a rather mild @xmath95 increase of the initial fireball temperature .",

    "<S> background : : :    a significant quenching of high energy jets was observed in the heavy    ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) facility ,    and is now confirmed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) facility . the    rhic plus lhc era provides a unique opportunity to study the    jet - medium interaction that leads to the jet quenching , and the medium    itself at different collision energies ( medium temperatures ) . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : : :    we study the azimuthal anisotropy of jet quenching , to seek    constraints on different models featuring distinct path - length and    density dependences for jet energy loss , and to gain a better    understanding of the medium . methods </S>",
    "<S> : : :    the models are fixed by using the rhic data , and then applied to study    the lhc case </S>",
    "<S> . a set of harmonic ( fourier ) coefficients    @xmath0 are extracted from the jet azimuthal anisotropy on    a event - by - event basis . </S>",
    "<S> results : : :    the second harmonics @xmath1 , mostly driven by the    medium s geometry , can be used to differentiate jet quenching models .    </S>",
    "<S> other harmonics are also compared with the lhc ( 2.76 tev ) data . </S>",
    "<S> the    predictions for future lhc ( 5.5 tev ) run are presented . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : : :    we find that a too strong path - length dependence ( e.g. , cubic ) is    ruled out by the lhc @xmath1 data , while the model with a    strong near-@xmath2 enhancement for the jet - medium    interaction describes the data very well </S>",
    "<S> . it is worth pointing out    that the latter model expects a less color - opaque medium at lhc . </S>"
