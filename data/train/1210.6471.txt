    "it is useful to introduce the scaled square of the standard gauss sum @xmath24 the standard gauss sum @xmath25 can be calculated analytically @xcite . due to the division of @xmath25 by @xmath1",
    "we find the result    @xmath26    which gives us three possibilities to find a factor @xmath27 of @xmath1 :    \\(i ) if @xmath28 , that is @xmath2 is an integer multiple of a factor , @xmath29 is larger than @xmath30 , whereas for all other @xmath2 the function @xmath31 is equal to unity .",

    "the gauss sum    @xmath42\\label{eq : trunc_gauss}\\ ] ]    which is most popular in the context of experiments is again defined for integer arguments but uses the fraction @xmath43 , that is the reciprocate of the ratio appearing in @xmath25 .",
    "morover , in @xmath44 the summation extends only over @xmath3 terms , which is not necessarily identical to @xmath1 . for this reason ,",
    "this gauss sum carries the name `` truncated gauss sum '' .",
    "the truncated gauss sum @xmath45 is of special interest , because it needs only a few summands to distinguish between factors and nonfactors .",

    "[ fig : trunc_gauss ] .",

    "fortunately there already exist some proposals for experiments with light , which do not suffer from this problem @xcite . the first proposal @xcite uses a sequence of interfering femto - second laser pulses with identical phases but variable separation between the pulses",
    ". the recent experiment @xcite employs an optical interferometer with variable optical path lengths . in both of the proposals ,",
    "the truncated gauss sum is calculated not only for integer values , but also for non - integers .",
    "this aspect has motivated us , to investigate the truncated gauss sum at rational arguments as discussed in the next section .",

    "we have called these factors ghost factors .",

    "( ii)the second method @xcite uses @xmath3 randomly chosen phases instead of m consecutive phases . with this method",
    "the minimum number @xmath3 of terms necessary to factor a number grows only logarithmically . in this way it was possible to factor a 17-digits number with only 10 pulses .",
    "so far , we have only considered the truncated gauss sum @xmath44 at integer arguments @xmath2 .",
    "this restriction was motivated by the fact , that @xmath4 is equal to unity , if and only if the integer trial factor @xmath2 is a factor of @xmath1 . in the present section",
    "we show that we can also gain information about the factors @xmath52 of @xmath1 from gauss sums at rational numbers .",
    "such an extension of the theory has been made necessary by a recent experiment @xcite where all trial factors are checked simultaneously .",
    "this experiment involves the truncated gauss sum not only for integer but also for rational numbers .",
    "indeed , the generalized truncated gauss sum @xmath53 for the continuous variable @xmath9 assumes the value @xmath54 for rational numbers of the form @xmath55 and @xmath56 with s integer and @xmath52 factor of @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting peaks have the information about the factors encoded either in their location , or in their frequency of appearance , or do not contain any information at all . obviously the maxima at @xmath57 contain information since their locations are proportional to the factors @xmath52 .",
    "since the peaks at @xmath58 are independent of @xmath1 , they can not give any hints about factors of @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis of the peaks at @xmath59 is not that straight forward",
    ". nevertheless , we show in the next section , that it is possible to obtain information about the factors @xmath52 .      the problem with the truncated gauss sum at rational arguments as a tool to factor numbers originates from the existence of additional peaks located at @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "on first sight , these maxima do not seem to give us any information about the factors of @xmath1 .",
    "however , in the present section , we outline two methods , that allow us to extract the factors from these additional peaks .",
    "if the gauss sum would not contain the peaks at @xmath60 or @xmath61 , we could determine the factors immediately from the maxima at @xmath62 .",
    "all we have to do in this case , is to search for a datapoint , where @xmath54 .",
    "the value @xmath63 will then give us a factor @xmath52 of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , we have to develop a strategy how to eliminate unwanted peaks and/or identify those peaks which contain useful information .    from the peaks at @xmath58",
    "we can not learn anything , since @xmath64 does not contain any information about the factors .",
    "fortunately , it is easy to ignore those peaks , since they are all located in the domain @xmath65 . for this reason ,",
    "we restrict our domain of interest to arguments @xmath66 .",
    "we now have to select from the forrest of peaks arising for @xmath66 the ones , which carry information about the factors . for this purpose",
    ", we discretize the curve obtained from the gauss sum @xmath44 with continuous argument @xmath9 by considering values of @xmath9 , which are integer multiples of the minimal step size @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , we confine the measurement range to @xmath68 .",
    "this domain must contain peaks at @xmath63 , but there will be no peaks at @xmath61 .",
    "the following consideration explains this observation .",
    "we assume , that at a given multiple integer @xmath2 of the step size @xmath67,there exists a peak , which can be attributed to the ration @xmath69 , where @xmath1 and @xmath70 do not share a commen factor . as a result , we have the identity @xmath71 since @xmath70 does not share a factor with @xmath1 and @xmath2 is an integer , @xmath70 has to be a divisor of @xmath72 .",
    "however , this fact implies the inequality @xmath73 and from eq.([eq:11 ] ) we find @xmath74 .",
    "this inequality is in contradiction with our assumption of the domain @xmath75 which provides us with the inequality @xmath76 , that is @xmath77 .     at rational arguments @xmath78 , with @xmath79 and @xmath70 integer , illustrated by the example @xmath80 .",
    "here we have confined ourselves to the range @xmath81 and have chosen a step size @xmath82 . despite of the fact that there are no factors in this domain , the gauss sum assumes the value unity at the positions @xmath83 and @xmath84 , corresponding to the maxima at @xmath63 where @xmath52 is a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "this analysis immediately suggests the factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 . due to the reduced domain of interest and the discreteness of the observation points",
    ", we do not observe the peaks from arguments @xmath60 or @xmath61 except the one located at @xmath85.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the reduction of the interval together with the discretization of the arguments of the truncated gauss sum ensure that all peaks appearing in the so - obtained diagram carry the information about the factors of @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : gauss_kont ] illustrates this method .",
    "we conclude this discussion by recalling that in the standard approach of factoring numbers using gauss sums at integer values , we have to search for factors at prime numbers smaller than @xmath5 . in the worst case",
    ", we have to test all prime numbers up to @xmath5 . in the present approach",
    ", we search for factors at integer multiples of @xmath67 in an interval up to @xmath86 . as a result , the present method scales in the same way as the standard one .",
    "however , the interval in which we perform the search is much smaller .",
    "it is in this sense that factorization with gauss sums at rationa arguments might be more efficient than the corresponding one at integers .",
    "moreover , it is appealing to use the full information contained in the gauss sum .",
    "we now propose a second method to take advantage of the additional peaks in the gauss sum at rational numbers .",
    "for this purpose we analyse the series @xmath69 and @xmath56 and note , that @xmath56 is contained in @xmath69 . in other words , because @xmath52 is factor of @xmath1 , some numbers @xmath69 can be expressed by @xmath87 . the number of different representations of the fraction @xmath69 depends of course on the factors of @xmath1 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : haeufigkeit ] we show for the example of @xmath88 the degree @xmath89 of degeneracy of these different representations of the same number , providing information about the factors .",
    "indeed , the periods contained in @xmath89 are the factors .",
    "we conclude by briefly addressing the question of how to implement the degree of degeneracy of ratios in a quantum system .",
    "many ideas offer themselves . in this context",
    "it suffices to name at least one . for this purpose",
    "we recall the phenomenon of quantum carpets @xcite . here",
    "structures appear in the spacetime representation of a schrdinger particle moving between two hard walls .",
    "indeed , the design of a quantum carpet has its origin in the degeneracy of the so - called intermode traces @xcite .",
    "it is only a small additional step to conjecture that the degeneracy of the ratios manifests itself in different steepnesses of the canals .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis goes beyond the scope of the present paper and we refer to a future publication .     with the help of the number @xmath89 of degeneracies of the truncated gauss sum @xmath6 at rational arguments . for @xmath90",
    "this function assumes the value unity at the rational numbers @xmath91 and @xmath69 , marked on the corresponding axes by rhombs , squares and full dots , respectively .",
    "fractions , which are connected with factors allow several representations . indeed ,",
    "the ratios @xmath92 and @xmath93 display the degree @xmath94 of degeneracy as indicated in the top by the full dot in the square .",
    "only the ratio @xmath95 is identical to @xmath96 and @xmath97 , giving rise to @xmath98 .",
    "the degree of degeneracies displays a double periodicity determined by the two factors . for example , the squares with the dots have the period @xmath99 , whereas the rhombs with the dots show the period @xmath36.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "the idea of factoring numbers using truncated gauss sums relies on the fact , that these sums assume the value unity if and only if the test factor is indeed a factor .",
    "however , this one - to - one relation is only true when we restrict the arguments of the truncated gauss sum to integer values .",
    "when we give up this restriction , we loose the possibility of uniquely identifying factors . in this case",
    "the truncated gauss sum takes on the value of unity at many non - integer values , which obviously can not be factors .",
    "however , this additional wealth of maxima also opens up new possibilities of factoring numbers . in the present paper",
    "we have introduced two methods , that allow us to obtain with the help of these on first sight useless peaks additional information about the factors .",
    "we thank m. jakob , m. tefak and m. s.zubairy for many fruitful discussions on this topic .",
