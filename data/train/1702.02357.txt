    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials are promising candidates for future electronics due to their unique characteristics . the pioneering 2d material , graphene , was experimentally isolated in 2004  @xcite .",
    "the bandstructure of @xmath2 electrons in single - layer graphene , modeled as a honeycomb lattice with lattice constant @xmath3 consisting of two triangular bravais sublattices @xmath4 and @xmath5 with nearest - neighbor hopping in the tight - binding formulation , hosts six dirac cones resulting from touching of the valence and conduction bands at the fermi energy @xmath6 .",
    "two of the cones located at diagonally opposite corners of the first brillouin zone can be chosen as inequivalent , for example at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 nm is the lattice constant of graphene .",
    "for the low - energy electronic excitations in the system they represent a new degree of freedom of an electron , in addition to the charge and spin .",
    "this _ valley _ degree of freedom can be exploited in analogy with the spin in spintronics , which gave rise to the field called _ valleytronics _ , where one uses the valley degree of freedom to encode information .",
    "there is a strong motivation to generate , controllably manipulate and read out states of definite valley polarization , and a substantial amount of theoretical and experimental work has been done towards achieving these goals . a recent review of some advances made in the field of valleytronics in 2d materials is provided in ref .  .",
    "to mention some : a gated graphene quantum point contact with zig - zag edges was proposed to function as a valley filter  @xcite .",
    "superconducting contacts were shown to enable the detection of the valley polarization in graphene  @xcite . in 2d honeycomb lattices with broken inversion symmetry ,",
    "e.g. transition metal dichalcogenide ( tmd ) monolayers , a non - zero berry curvature carries opposite signs in the @xmath10 and @xmath8 valleys . in these 2d materials ,",
    "the velocity in the direction perpendicular to an applied in - plane electric field is proportional to this berry curvature  @xcite .",
    "hence the electrons acquire a valley - antisymmetric transverse velocity leading to the valley hall effect , which spatially separates different valley states . in a system where the occupation numbers of the two valleys are different",
    "( valley - polarized system ) , a finite transverse voltage across the sample is developed and the sign of this voltage can be used to measure the valley polarization  @xcite .",
    "the valley hall effect can also be exploited in a biased bilayer graphene , where the out - of - plane electric field breaks the inversion symmetry  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the broken inversion symmetry results in the valley - dependent optical selection rule , which can be used to selectively excite carriers in the @xmath10 or @xmath8 valley via right or left circularly polarized light , respectively  @xcite .",
    "a proposal not exploiting external fields has also been recently given  @xcite .",
    "there strain - induced inhomogeneous pseudomagnetic fields , which act oppositely in the two valleys , are used as a basis for valley filtering and valley splitting devices .    in this paper",
    "we propose a way to generate and controllably manipulate the valley polarization of electrons in a graphene @xmath0-@xmath1 junction in the presence of an out - of - plane magnetic field . applying an out - of - plane magnetic field to the graphene sheet",
    "leads to the formation of low - energy relativistic landau levels ( lls )  @xcite .",
    "these are responsible for the unusual quantum hall conductance quantization @xmath11 , where the integer @xmath1 is the highest occupied landau level index ( for @xmath1-type doping ) for a given chemical potential .",
    "the factor @xmath12 in the formula accounts for the spin degeneracy and the second factor @xmath13 for the valley degeneracy of the landau levels .",
    "the presence of the @xmath6 dirac point and particle - hole symmetry lead to a special @xmath14 ll , which is responsible for the fraction @xmath15 in the conductance .",
    "semiclassically , charged particles propagating in a spatially varying out - of - plane magnetic field in 2d may exhibit snake - like trajectories that are oriented perpendicularly to the field gradient @xcite .",
    "the simplest case occurs along a nodal line of a spatially varying magnetic field @xcite .",
    "another system , a graphene @xmath0-@xmath1 junction in a homogeneous out - of - plane magnetic field , hosts similar states located at the interface between @xmath1- and @xmath0-doped regions .",
    "these interface states are also called snake states due to the shape of their semiclassical trajectories  @xcite .",
    "a correspondence between these two kinds of snake trajectories was pointed out in ref .  .",
    "a mapping between these two systems was found by rewriting both problems in a nambu ( doubled ) formulation  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a graphene @xmath0-@xmath1 junction in a homogeneous out - of - plane magnetic field , a system which has attracted a lot of attention  @xcite . in the limit of a large junction ( where the phase coherence is suppressed due to inelastic scattering or random time - dependent electric fields )",
    ", the conductance is a series conductance of @xmath1- and @xmath0-doped regions  @xcite .",
    "however , for sufficiently small junctions the conductance depends on the microscopic edge termination close to the @xmath0-@xmath1 interface .",
    "when the chemical potential in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 regions is is within the first landau gap , i.e. , is restricted to energy values smaller than the absolute value of the energy difference between the zeroth and the first landau level , an analytical formula for the conductance can be derived  @xcite , see eq .  .",
    "we demonstrate that a three - terminal device like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] can be used as a switchable , i.e. voltage - tunable valley filter . in short ,",
    "it works as follows : valley - unpolarized electrons injected from the upper lead are collected in the lower leads with high valley polarization .",
    "the valley polarization of the collected electrons is controlled by switching the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction on and off , while the partitioning of the electron density between the two lower leads is controlled by the edge termination and the width @xmath16 of the central region close to the @xmath0-@xmath1 interface .",
    "our results are not restricted to graphene .",
    "they apply also to honeycomb lattices with broken inversion symmetry , where the inversion symmetry breaking term is represented by a staggered sublattice potential .",
    "as long as the amplitude of this term is smaller than the built - in potential step in the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction , our results remain valid . in a system with broken inversion symmetry ,",
