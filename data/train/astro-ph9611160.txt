    "in particular , although we tried various procedures , we never obtained statistically fully satisfactory spectral fits for the sis detectors .",
    "this could be partly attributed to uncertainties in some of the models used ( see below ) and/or in detector calibration .",
    "we now give a summary of the tests we performed during the data analysis .",
    "then we will concentrate on the results obtained . in order to estimate the uncertainties on the psf calibration , we extracted sis spectra using two different circle sizes , i.e. with a smaller circle implying a larger psf correction .",
    "we used a radius of 38 original pixels and another of 150 original pixels ( 130 for sis1 ) .",
    "the larger circle is the one suggested by the asca observatory team ( for sis1 we had to use a slightly smaller radius as the source is not centered in the 1ccd detector fov ) .",
    "all fits with different models , detector combinations , and energy ranges ( by ignoring channels ) were performed on both spectra extracted using both circle sizes . as a result",
    ", we found that the best  fit values for the temperatures and abundances are quite similar in the two cases , but they are better constrained for the larger extraction radius , although in this case the fits are statistically less satisfactory ( i.e. the reduced @xmath134 is always larger ) .",
    "the formally better fits obtained with the smaller extraction radius are probably due to the larger statistical errors associated with the energy bins , given that using a smaller circle implies fewer counts per bin .",
    "the higher s / n spectra amplify the uncertainties in the sis calibration and in the spectral models . also , we should point out that two different normalizations for every component are necessary to fit the two sis spectra extracted in the smaller circle ( one for each detector ) , while they are not required for the larger circle sis spectra .",
    "this immediately shows that the psf uncertainties are reduced by using the larger circle . in the following discussion",
    ", we will concentrate only on the larger circle sis spectra .",
    "the low  energy channels contribute most to the @xmath134 .",
    "it is already known that there are particular problems with the calibration of the sis detectors below 0.55 kev . to test the influence of the low  energy channels on the spectral fit results ,",
    "we systematically fitted the sis0 spectrum by gradually increasing the low ",
    "energy cut - off ( sis0 is the better calibrated between the two siss ) .",
    "the lowest energy values considered in the various cases are 0.3 , 0.55 , 0.7 and 0.8 kev .",
    "we found that the reduced @xmath134 significantly improves each time we removed the lowest energy bins .",
    "the elemental abundance value in solar proportion ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) goes from essentially solar to very low value as the low  energy limit goes from 0.3 to 0.55 kev . although any further increase of the low  energy limit does not significantly change the abundance value , it does cause a change in the temperature values .",
    "in fact , the second temperature component is not constrained any longer and , indeed , a single intermediate temperature is sufficient to fit the data .",
    "based on these results , we decided to use 0.55 kev as the lower energy limit .",
    "a similar problem arose for the channels above 4 kev .",
    "in all four detectors , the count rates in the high  energy channels are systematically in excess of the various best  fitted models .",
    "being common to all four detectors , such an excess could be intrinsic to the source spectrum , but it could also be due to uncertainties in the data and/or in the calibration .",
    "as a matter of fact , there are few bins above 4 kev and they have large errors due to the low count rate at high  energy ( we rebinned the spectrum to have at least 25 counts per bin ) .",
    "we then decided to ignore all the energy channels above 4 kev , since they have a limited influence on the fits .",
    "finally , we computed the errors in our model fitting using two different statistical methods . in our spectra , the counts in each bin go from 25 to a few hundred and standard poissonian statistics should be fairly adequate .",
    "however , these counts also include the background contribution .",
    "thus , in the background subtracted spectra , there could be some bins with too low a count rate to properly apply poissonian statistics .",
    "special statistics with @xmath135 is found to be better suited when the number of counts @xmath136 is small ( gehrels 1986 ) .",
    "when n is large , the two are essentially the same .",
    "we performed extensive tests with the xspec package ( version 9.01 ) using statistical errors computed with the two procedures and we found that the best  fit parameters in non ",
    "critical situations ( e.g. when the best  fit parameters are well defined ) are almost identical , although in some special cases they are better constrained using the second statistical method .",
    "in particular , this non  standard way of weighting , as expected , is less sensitive to the channels above @xmath137 kev , which have the lowest number of counts . in addition , @xmath134 is lower , but again this is not surprising since the error bars are larger . in the following ,",
    "we use the second statistical method .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that no difference in the results obtained with the two statistical methods was found after we restricted the sis intervals between 0.554 kev .",
    "for the spectral analysis , we used the optically thin plasma models by raymond & smith ( rs , 1977 ) and mewe et al .",

    "a two - temperature model with solar abundances gives unacceptable fits to the sis spectra .",
    "a clear improvement is obtained either by adding a third temperature component or by allowing the abundances to vary ( in solar proportion ) .",
    "the latter model gives much better fits with subsolar abundances ( @xmath143 ; see table[tab : sis01 ] ) , while the former is still unacceptable . in figure 2 , we plot the sis0 spectrum together with the best  fitted 3 t mk model with abundances fixed at the solar value .",
    "note the structures in the residuals , which immediately show that a solar value for the abundances does not allow a good fit to the data .",
    "however , in no case are our fits to the data fully satisfactory ( see table[tab : sis01 ] ) .",
    "given the statistics of our data , we did not try a 3 t model with variable abundances .",
    "the spectra obtained with the two gis cameras have lower spectral resolution and are also noisier . a good fit to the gis data is obtained both with @xmath144 models with solar abundances or with @xmath145 models with lower  than  solar abundances . in the latter case ,",

    "since the fluxes estimated during the two observations are similar and since the ratios of the three normalizations between the two missions are different with no systematic trend , the need of different normalizations between rosat and asca is probably due to detector calibration uncertainties rather than to source variability .",
    "our main goal was to see if there is a difference in the elemental abundances between very active young stars , as hd35850 should be , and more evolved active stars such as the rs cvn ",
    "type binaries .    in the fits of the sis spectra ,",
    "all models with solar abundance ( 2 t and 3 t rs or mk ) that we considered do not give acceptable fits .",
    "instead , a 2 t model with abundances free to vary in solar proportion gives much better fits , although statistically not fully satisfactory , with most of the @xmath134 contribution arising from the structures between 0.7 and 1.1 kev .",
    "this is probably due to either an inaccurate calibration of the sis detectors or to uncertainties and/or inaccuracies in the current plasma models , which are below the noise in the low  energy resolution gis spectra , but could well affect the higher resolution sis data .",
    "in fact , there is growing evidence that plasma codes fail to some degree to model the cool star spectra obtained with both the euve and asca satellites .",
    "theoretical and/or numerical improvements are thus required in the commonly used thin plasma models ( for a full discussion see brickhouse et al .",
    "1995 ) . in any case",
    ", subsolar abundances on the order of @xmath0 are required to fit our asca  sis data .",
    "not surprisingly , the analysis of the gis data gives less clear results due to the lower spectral resolution and s / n .",
    "statistically , the gis data can equally be fitted by a 1 t plasma with subsolar abundances or by a 2 t plasma with abundances fixed at solar value . on the other hand ,",
    "the rosat pspc data seem to require a 2 t model with subsolar abundances , although from these data alone it is not possible to properly constrain the temperatures , while the abundances are loosely determined to be between 0.20.6 the solar value .",
    "these results have been improved by simultaneous spectral fitting of data from different detector combinations .",
    "analyzing together the best calibrated detectors , i.e. sis0 and gis2 , simply confirms the results obtained with the sis0 fits .",
    "we then widened the energy range by simultaneously fitting sis0 , gis2 and rosat pspc data ( not simultaneous with the asca data ) . in this case , a third temperature is required to fit the data , confirming the results already found for other sources ( e.g. singh et al .",
    "we used 3 t models with fixed solar abundances or abundances variable in solar proportion .",
    "once again , we find that subsolar metal abundances , with values between 0.2 and 0.4 , are required to fit the rosat+asca data .",
    "we can then conclude that all of our asca and rosat data show that the coronal plasma of hd35850 is characterised by metal abundances lower than solar , on the order of @xmath259 .",
    "this is in line with previous asca results . as a matter of fact , the asca data of active cool stars analysed so far point towards abundances typically in the range 0.10.3 of the solar value .",
    "these asca results are valid , in general , for very active and more evolved stars like the rs cvn and algol binaries ( white et al .",
    "1994 , white 1996 ; singh et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; ortolani et al .",
    "nevertheless , low abundances have also been found in flare stars ( gotthelf et al .",
    "1994 , mewe et al .",
    "1996c ) and , to a lesser extent , in single g / k  type stars ( drake et al .",
    "furthermore , there is the case of ab dor , a young star whose photospheric abundances are solar ( vilhu et al .",
    "1987 ) , but for which a metal poor corona , a factor 23 below solar , is required to fit simultaneous asca and euve spectra ( white et al .",
    "1996 , mewe et al .",
    "and now we have the case of hd35850 , a young star whose photospheric abundances are also solar ( tagliaferri et al . 1994 ) , but the corona is subsolar .",
    "so the general trend seems to be that more evolved , very active stars have low coronal metal abundances , while for the solar - type star ek dra probably this is not the case ( gdel et al .",
    "these conclusions are not based on asca data alone , but also on ginga ( tsuru et al .",
    "1989 ; stern et al . 1992 ) and , more recently , on rosat and euve data ( e.g. ottmann & schmitt 1996 ; krster & schmitt 1996 ; singh et al . 1996",
    "; stern et al . 1995 ; rucinski et al . 1995 ; mewe et al .",
    "1996c ; schmitt et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the low spectral resolution of present x - ray detectors is not sufficient to resolve individual spectral lines , particularly in the fe - l complex near 1 kev .",
    "this , combined with incomplete and possibly incorrect model line emissivities , can lead to erroneous abundance determinations ( e.g. liedahl et al .",
    "1995 ) even if the effect is not so large to explain a reduction factor 35 in the abundances",
    ". however , all evidence points towards low metal abundances in very active stars .",
    "this seems to be a robust result , as it can not be fully ascribed to detector calibration problems .",
    "a tentative explanation can be given recalling the well known fact that coronal abundances in very active regions of the sun are quite different from those in the photosphere .",
    "in particular , there is the so - called fip ( first ionization potential ) effect .",
    "elements having fips less than @xmath260 ev are overabundant by typically a factor of four compared to those elements with higher fips ( meyer 1991 ; feldman 1992 ) .",
    "more recently , data obtained with the spacecraft ulysses have shown that the fip effect is much reduced in inactive regions ( e.g. coronal holes ) ( geiss et al .",
    "so already in the sun there is a clear link between activity and metal abundances in the coronal plasma , but the situation is not at all clear and differences between different coronal structures or over time in the same regions have been detected ( see haisch et al .",
    "1995 for a full discussion ) .",
    "however , in the case of active stars , no fip effect has been seen so far ( but see gdel et al .",
    "1996 ; mg overabundant by a factor @xmath261 , while the other elements seem solar ) .",
    "rather a general underabundance of most elements seems to prevail .",
    "this leads us to ask if there is a  saturation effect \" also with respect to coronal elemental abundances .    to check",
    "if a fip effect is present in the sis data of hd35850 , we performed simultaneous sis0+sis1 spectral fits with 2 t plasma models and abundances free to vary in non - solar proportions .",
    "we found quite a good agreement between the rs and mk models , with very low values of n , o and ne .",
    "all other elements are around 0.20.3 , except ni , which has a high value in the rs model while it is more in line with the other elements in the mk model .",
    "so there could be an indication that elements with high fip ( n , o , ne ) are more depleted than the element with low fip .",
    "however , the uncertainties both in the models and in the detector calibrations are such that we can not draw any conclusion at the present stage . in any case we note that , besides activity , age should also play a role , i.e. coronal elemental abundances are probably related both to the age and to the activity level of the star . for instance , the old but active pop ii binary hd89499 presents a virtually metal free corona , i.e. still lower coronal abundances ( fleming & tagliaferri 1996 ) , in line with its very low photospheric metallicity due to its age",
    ". we may conclude by saying that the picture of metal abundance behaviour in the corona of active stars is still far from clear . to improve our understanding",
    ", we probably have to wait for the next generation of x - ray detectors with higher energy resolution and larger effective area , such as the gratings that will be on board the axaf and xmm satellites",
    ".    as expected , two temperatures are necessary to fit the asca spectra and they seem very well constrained .",
    "if we consider the rs and mk results together for the various detectors , the softer component is between t = 0.4  0.7 kev , while the harder one is between t = 0.8  1.1 kev .",
    "these results are confirmed by the analysis of the rosat data , although with less constrained limits .",
    "these temperature values , in particular the hotter ones , are lower with respect to the values found for the rs cvn and algol binaries ( white et al .",
    "1994 ; antunes et al . 1994 ; singh et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) and for ab dor ( white et al . 1996 ; mewe et al .",
    "1996b ) , but higher than other single g / k stars ( drake et al .",
    "not only the plasma temperatures but also the total luminosity of this star is remarkable .",
    "the 0.52.0 kev luminosity is above @xmath262 in all of the three x - ray detections ( exosat , rosat and asca , spanning 9 years in time ) , an extremely high value for a single late f - type star ( e.g. fleming et al .",
    "1989 , 1995 ; gdel et al . 1995",
    "; schmitt 1996 ) .",
    "this is an indirect confirmation that hd35850 is a young , rapidly rotating object .",
    "in the simultaneous fit of the asca+rosat data , a third temperature is required .",
    "however , this is not just an addition of a softer component , but is more a redistribution of the dominant temperatures , with a widening of the temperature range toward both lower and higher values .",
    "the harder component of the three is not very well constrained , with an uncertainty on the upper limit @xmath263 on the best ",
    "fit value . in any case , the range spanned by the three temperatures seems not very large , from 5 to 15 million degrees , compared to the rs cvn and algol binaries case . in our analysis , we also find that the rs model yields lower abundances and temperatures than the mk model .",
    "the differences are not very large , but are consistently present in the analysis of all detectors .    in conclusion ,",
    "our data show that : i ) hd35850 , a single f - type star , is a very active x - ray source ; ii ) its coronal plasma is characterised by low metal abundance values ; iii ) its x - ray emission is dominated by a coronal plasma with temperatures in the range of 515 million degrees .",
