    "i.e. under the assumption that there is asymptotically no excluded volume  @xmath14 , boltzmann introduced an intermediate level of description , referred to as kinetic theory , in which the state of the gas is described by the statistical distribution @xmath15 of the position and velocity of a typical particle . in the boltzmann - grad scaling  @xmath16",

    "fluid equations of hydrodynamics can be recovered directly from the microscopic system or in a two - step limit using boltzmann s kinetic equation as a mesoscopic description .",

    "the best result concerning the low density limit , which is due to lanford in the case of hard - spheres  @xcite and king @xcite for more general potentials ( see also @xcite for a complete proof ) is indeed valid only for short times , i.e. breaks down before any relaxation can be observed .",

    ", the convergence of the markov process associated to the linear boltzmann operator @xmath41 towards the brownian motion is by now a classical result @xcite .",
    "a good notion of fluctuation is obtained by considering the motion of a tagged particle ( or possibly a finite set of tagged particles ) in a gas of @xmath0 particles initially at equilibrium ( or close to equilibrium ) , in the limit @xmath11 .      if the background particles are infinitely heavier than the tagged particle then the dynamics can be approximated by a lorentz gas , i.e. by the motion of the tagged particle in a frozen background .",
    "the linear boltzmann equation has been derived ( globally in time ) from the dynamics of a tagged particle in a low density lorentz gas , meaning that    * the obstacles are distributed randomly according to some poisson distribution ; * the obstacles have no dynamics , in particular they do not feel the effect of collisions with the tagged particle .",
    "this problem , suggested by lorentz @xcite at the beginning of the twentieth century to study the motion of electrons in metals , is the core of a number of works , and the corresponding literature includes a large variety of contributions .",
    "we do not intend to be exhaustive here and refer the reader to the book by spohn ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) for a survey on this topic .",
    "we state one basic result due to gallavotti @xcite in the low density limit and then indicate some of the many important research directions .",

    "a refinement of this result can be found for instance in @xcite in terms of convergence of path measures ( and not only of the mean density ) , as well as in @xcite where the convergence is proven for typical scatterer configurations ( and not only in average ) .",
    "these convergence statements lead naturally to various questions concerning    * the assumptions on the microscopic potential of interaction , * the role of randomness for the distribution of scatterers , * the long time behavior of the system , in particular the relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium and hydrodynamic limits .",
    "the first point was addressed by desvillettes , pulvirenti and ricci @xcite .",
    "their goal was to derive  singular \" kinetic equations such as the linear boltzmann equation without angular cut - off or the fokker - planck equation , from a system of particles with long - range interactions .",
    "they have obtained partial results in this direction , insofar as they can consider only asymptotically long - range interactions . due to the fact that the range of the potential is infinite in the limit , the test particle interacts typically with infinitely many obstacles .",
    "thus the set of bad configurations of the scatterers ( such as the set of configurations yielding recollisions ) preventing the markov property of the limit must be estimated explicitly .",
    "even though the long - range tails add a very small contribution to the total force for each typical scatterer distribution , the non grazing collisions generate an exponential instability making the two trajectories ( with and without cut - off ) very different .",
    "the complete derivation of the linear boltzmann equation for long - range interactions is therefore still open .",
    "it is often appropriate from a physical point of view to consider more general distributions of obstacles than the poisson distribution . in particular , in the original problem of lorentz , the atoms of metal are distributed on a periodic network .",
    "for the two - dimensional periodic lorentz gas with fixed scatterer size , bunimovich and sinai @xcite have shown the convergence , after a suitable time rescaling , of the tagged particle to a brownian motion .",
    "their method relies on techniques from ergodic theory  : it uses the fact that the mapping carrying a phase point on the boundary of a scatterer to the next phase point along its trajectory can be represented by a symbolic dynamics on a countable alphabet which is an ergodic markov chain on a finite state space .",
    "another important research direction , initiated by golse , is to consider the periodic lorentz gas in the boltzmann - grad limit . in this case",
    "there can be infinitely long free flight paths and the linear boltzmann equation is no longer a valid limit  @xcite , but the convergence toward a brownian motion can be recovered after an appropriate superdiffusive rescaling @xcite .    in @xcite , erds , salmhofer and yau obtained the counterpart of the long time behavior for random quantum systems .",
    "our approach is closer to their method than to the ones used for the periodic lorentz gas ( even though the setting of @xcite deals with a fixed random distribution of obstacles and a slightly different regime , known as weak coupling limit ) .",
    "their proof is indeed based on a careful analysis of duhamel s formula in combination with a renormalization of the propagator and stopping rules to control recollisions .",
    "we refer also to  @xcite for further developments on the quantum case .",
    "we adopt here a different point of view , and consider a deterministic system of @xmath0 hard - spheres , meaning that the tagged particle is identical to the particles of the background , interacting according to the same collision laws . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the case @xmath50 ( and refer to  @xcite for results in the case  @xmath51 ) .    on the one hand",
    ", the problem seems more difficult than the lorentz gas insofar as the background has its own dynamics , which is coupled with the tagged particle .",
    "but , on the other hand , pathological situations as described in @xcite are not stable : because of the dynamics of the scatterers , we expect the situation to be better since some ergodicity could be retrieved from the additional degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , there are invariant measures for the whole system , i.e. the system consisting in both the background and the tagged particle .    here",
    "we shall take advantage of the latter property to establish global uniform a priori bounds for the distribution of particles , and more generally for all marginals of the @xmath0-particle distribution ( see proposition [ apriori - est ] ) .",
    "this will be the key to control the collision process , and to prove ( like in kac s model  @xcite for instance ) that dynamics for which a very large number of collisions occur over a short time interval , are of vanishing probability .",
    "note that a similar strategy , based on the existence of the invariant measure , was already used by van beijeren , lanford , lebowitz and spohn @xcite to derive the linear boltzmann equation for long times .",
    "let us now give the precise framework of our study .",
    "as explained above , the idea is to improve lanford s result by considering fluctuations around some global equilibrium .",
    "locally the  @xmath0-particle distribution @xmath52 should therefore look like a conditioned tensorized maxwellian .    in the sequel , we shall focus on the case of hard - sphere dynamics ( with mass @xmath53 ) to avoid technicalities due to artificial boundaries and cluster estimates .",

    "the strategy of perturbating @xmath91 is classical in probability theory ; following this strategy    * we lose asymptotically the nonlinear coupling : we thus expect to get a linear equation for the distribution of the tagged particle ; * we also lose the feedback of the tagged particles on the background : since this background is constituted of @xmath93 indistinguishable particles , the momentum and energy exchange with the tagged particle has a very small effect on each one of these indistinguishable particles and thus does not modify on average the background distribution . as a consequence , the limiting equation for the distribution of the tagged particle should be non conservative .",
