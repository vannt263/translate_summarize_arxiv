    "scalar fields propagating on a fixed ads background reveal several interesting features . as shown during the 80 s , their energy turns out to be positive provided the squared mass is bounded from below by a negative quantity , according to@xmath0this is known as the breitenlohner - freedman bound breitenlohner - freedmann , mezin - townsend , which guarantees the stability of an ads spacetime of radius @xmath1 against scalar field perturbations .",
    "particularly interesting is the case of scalar fields whose mass is within the range@xmath2since they are able to acquire slow fall - off at infinity . in turn , this generates a strong back reaction of the metric in the asymptotic region , such that in certain cases they can not be treated as a probe @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the metric has to be relaxed as compared with the standard one @xcite for a localized distribution of matter .",
    "this has the effect of enlarging the space of physically admissible configurations , bringing in new classes of solutions including hairy black holes and solitons hmtz-2 + 1 , mtz1 , mtz2 , mtz3 , mtz4 , mtz5 , mtz6 .",
    "finding exact analytic solutions that circumvent no hair theorems is not an easy task .",
    "one of the simplest and instructive examples where this can be achieved corresponds to general relativity with a minimally coupled self - interacting scalar field in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the action is given by@xmath3=\\frac{1}{\\pi",
    "[ \\frac{r}{16}-\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\phi ) ^{2}-v(\\phi ) \\right ] \\ ; ,   \\label{action}\\]]with the following self - interaction potential@xmath4having a global maximum at @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 , and a mass term given by @xmath7 , which lies within the range ( [ bounds ] ) .",
    "this potential has a simple interpretation in the conformal ( jordan ) frame ( see appendix [ a1 ] ) .",
    "when the self - interaction parameter fullfills @xmath8 , apart from the btz black hole @xcite , which is a solution of this action in vacuum , i.e. , with a vanishing scalar field , the field equations admit an exact , static and circularly symmetric hairy black hole hmtz-2 + 1 .",
    "the solution possesses a non trivial scalar field given by @xmath9where  @xmath10 , and the metric reads @xmath11with @xmath12 , and the coordinates range as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 . note that the hairy black hole is well - defined for @xmath16 , and it depends on a single non - negative integration constant @xmath17 , such that the scalar field is regular everywhere .",
    "the curvature singularity at the origin is enclosed by an event horizon located at@xmath18where @xmath19is a function of the parameter @xmath20 appearing in the potential . the hawking temperature and the mass ,",
    "are given by@xmath21respectively , and the entropy reads@xmath22    as also shown in @xcite , the hairy black hole describes an asymptotically ads spacetime in a relaxed sense as compared with the standard one of brown and henneaux @xcite .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic behavior of the hairy black hole belongs to the following class:@xmath23@xmath24   g_{tr}=o(r^{-2 } ) &   & g_{\\varphi \\varphi } = r^{2}+o(1 ) \\\\[1 mm ]   g_{\\varphi r}=o(r^{-2 } ) &   & g_{t\\varphi } = o(1)\\end{array } \\label{asympt metric}\\]]where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "remarkably , this set of asymptotic conditions is also left invariant under the conformal group in two dimensions , spanned by two copies of the virasoro algebra .",
    "it was found that the effect of relaxing the asymptotic conditions is such that the generators of the asymptotic symmetries acquire a nontrivial contribution from the scalar field .",
    "following the regge - teitelboim approach @xcite , the canonical generators are given by@xmath27 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{q}\\]]where the massless btz black hole has been chosen as reference background .",
    "the poisson brackets of these generators were shown to span two copies of the virasoro algebra with the standard central charges:@xmath28",
    "the existence of hairy black holes , for @xmath8 , that fit within a set of asymptotic conditions being invariant under the conformal group at the boundary , whose corresponding charge algebra acquires a nontrivial central extension , makes compulsory wondering whether their entropy could be obtained from the asymptotic growth of the number of states by means of cardy formula @xcite , as it is the case for the btz black hole @xcite .",
    "once the hairy black hole entropy ( [ entropy ] ) is expressed in terms of its mass,@xmath29at a first glance , for a reader that is slightly familiarized with the standard form of the cardy formula , @xmath30where @xmath31 are the eigenvalues of the left and right virasoro operators , it does nt seem so obvious how this task could be successfully performed . in order to clarify the picture , some remarks are worth to be pointed out :    @xmath32 for a fixed value of the mass @xmath33 , there are ( at least ) two different static and circularly symmetric black holes ; namely , the btz black hole ( in vacuum ) , and the hairy black hole ( when the nontrivial scalar field is switched on ) .",
    "@xmath32 note that , since the hairy black hole depends on a single integration constant , the scalar field can not be switched off keeping the mass fixed .",
    "this means that the hairy and btz black holes can not be smoothly deformed into each other , which suggests that they belong to different disconnected sectors .",
    "thus , for a fixed value of the mass , despite the fact that there are ( at least ) two different black hole configurations , eq .",
    "( [ cardy simple ] ) only reproduces the entropy of the btz black hole , which corresponds to the vacuum sector .",
    "this raises a puzzle : how can the entropy of the hairy black hole be obtained by means of cardy formula ?    as it is explained in section [ microscopic ] , formula ( [ cardy simple ] ) implicitly assumes that the ground state is ads spacetime .",
    "thus , since the entropy obtained from ( [ cardy simple ] ) does not reproduces ( at least ) the sum of the entropy of the hairy and vacuum black holes , ads spacetime should be regarded as a suitable ground state _ only _ for the vacuum sector .",
    "hence , if holography works , one should expect that the hairy sector possesses a different ground state , disconnected from the vacuum one , so that cardy formula successfully reproduces the entropy of the hairy black hole when this is taken into account .",
    "the resolution of the puzzle comes from the fact that the suitable ground state for the hairy sector indeed exists and it is described by a soliton .",
    "the full picture can then be summarized as follows :    @xmath32 the btz and the hairy black hole belong to disconnected sectors , each with its own ground state .",
    "for the vacuum sector , the ground state corresponds to ads spacetime , while for the hairy sector , the ground state corresponds to the scalar soliton .",
    "@xmath32 the soliton fulfills what is expected for a ground state : it is smooth and regular everywhere , as well as devoid of integration constants .",
    "@xmath32 in analogy with what occurs for the vacuum , the energy spectrum of the hairy sector consists of a continuous part bounded from below by zero ( hairy black holes ) , a gap ( naked singularities ) , and a ground state with negative mass fixed by the fundamental constants of the theory ( soliton ) .",
    "it is then reassuring to verify that cardy formula reproduces the entropy of the hairy black hole in exact agreement with the semiclassical result .",
    "this is performed in section [ microscopic ] . in what follows",
    ", the precise analytic form of the scalar soliton is discussed .",
    "the field equations that correspond to the action ( [ action ] ) with the self - interaction potential ( [ potential ] ) , in the case of @xmath34 admit the following exact solution:@xmath35with@xmath36where the coordinates range according to @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath15 .",
    "note that the solution is devoid of integration constants .",
    "it is also simple to verify that the soliton is smooth everywhere and it fits within the relaxed set of asymptotically ads conditions given by eq .",
    "( [ asympt metric ] ) .",
    "this latter property can be explicitly checked by performing a coordinate transformation defined through@xmath39with @xmath40 , so that the metric and the scalar field read@xmath41@xmath42respectively .",
    "in the case of @xmath43 , the solution generalizes as@xmath44with@xmath45and where is recovered since @xmath46 , and thus  @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for @xmath49 ,",
    "these constants range as @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ( see appendix [ a2]).]@xmath52just depend on the self - interaction parameter @xmath20 , and @xmath53 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ schuster ] ) , so that there are no integration constants .",
    "the soliton is regular and its causal structure coincides with the one of ads spacetime .",
    "applying the following change of coordinates:@xmath54one verifies that the soliton with a nonvanishing value of @xmath20 also fulfills the set of relaxed asymptotically ads conditions defined by ( asympt metric ) .",
    "these coordinates are useful in order to compute the mass of the soliton , which can be readily obtained from the canonical generators defined by the surface integrals in eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "the mass is found to be given by@xmath55and as expected , depends only on the newton constant and the self - interaction parameter .",
    "note that the soliton mass is manifestly negative , and it turns out to be bounded in between zero and the mass of ads spacetime , i.e. for the allowed values of the self - interaction parameter , @xmath56 , the soliton mass ranges according to ( see appendix [ a2])@xmath57",
    "as mentioned in section [ puzzle ] , the entropy of the hairy black hole can be microscopically computed provided the soliton is regarded as the ground state of the hairy sector . in order to achieve this task , the asymptotic growth of the number of states , given by cardy formula , has to be recalled from scratch .",
    "if the spectrum of the virasoro operators @xmath58 , whose eigenvalues are denoted by @xmath59 , is such that the lowest eigenvalues @xmath60 are nonvanishing ( i.e. , for @xmath61 ) , cardy formula reads @xcite@xmath62where it is assumed that the ground state is non degenerate .",
    "we would like pointing out here that , in terms of the shifted virasoro operators@xmath63this formula can be rewritten as follows:@xmath64where ( @xmath65 ) @xmath66 correspond to the ( lowest ) eigenvalues of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , remarkably , the asymptotic growth of the number of states can also obtained if one only knows the spectrum of @xmath67 without making any explicit reference to the central charges .",
    "note that unitarity , and the fact that expression ( [ cardy super reloaded ] ) makes sense only for negative lowest eigenvalues @xmath68 , impose the following bounds ( see e.g. @xcite).]@xmath69    .",
    "then , it is given by @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , where @xmath65 and @xmath72 correspond to the lowest eigenvalues of @xmath67 and their degeneracies , respectively . ]    formula ( [ cardy super reloaded ] ) , or equivalently ( [ carlip reloaded ] ) , provide the suitable ground in order to obtain the black hole entropy for both sectors , namely vacuum and hairy , from the asymptotic number of states in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this is performed assuming that the eigenvalues of @xmath73 are given by their corresponding canonical generators expressed by the surface integrals in eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) , which are related with the mass and the angular momentum according to@xmath74 explicitly , this can be seen as follows :    _ vacuum sector : _ as it was explained in sec .",
    "[ puzzle ] , for the vacuum sector , the ground state corresponds to ads spacetime , whose lowest eigenvalue is given by @xmath75    hence , since in the vacuum sector @xmath76 can be expressed in terms of the central charges , i.e. , @xmath77 , one verifies that formula ( [ cardy super reloaded ] ) reduces to ( [ cardy simple ] ) , which by virtue of ( [ virasoros ] ) exactly reproduces the entropy of the btz black hole @xcite .",
    "_ hairy sector : _ in this case , the ground state is described by the scalar soliton , for which    @xmath78    note that from eq . ( [ m sol range ] ) ,",
    "the lowest eigenvalues of the virasoro operators in ( [ delta0sol ] ) fulfill the bounds given by eq .",
    "( bound delta zero ) , since @xmath79 . ] .",
    "therefore , since for the hairy black hole @xmath80 , formula ( [ cardy super reloaded ] ) , with ( [ delta0sol ] ) gives @xmath81 in exact agreement with its semiclassical entropy ( [ s(m ) hairy ] ) .",
    "thus , for fixed values of the global charges , it is confirmed that the total entropy comes form the contribution of each sector .",
    "scalar solitons have been shown to exist in general relativity with minimally and conformally coupled self - interacting scalar field in three dimensions .",
    "the soliton is regular everywhere , has a finite negative mass and fulfills the same set of asymptotically ads conditions as the hairy black hole which are relaxed as compared with the ones of brown - henneaux .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the soliton and the hairy black hole also obey the same boundary conditions , since the constant @xmath82 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ asympt scalar ] ) takes the same value , @xmath83 , in both cases .",
    "the very existence of the scalar soliton appears to be essential in order to reproduce the hairy black hole entropy from a microscopic counting .",
    "indeed , the soliton turns out to be the suitable nondegenerate ground state that is required to obtain the entropy from the asymptotic growth of the number states given by cardy formula .",
    "these results can also be extended for the ( grand ) canonical ensemble ( see appendix [ a3 ] ) , as well as for the rotating case by applying a boost in the @xmath84  cylinder .",
    "the lack of integration constants for the soliton can also be understood from the fact that the solution ( [ soliton with nu ] ) , ( [ scalar field with nu ] ) can be recovered from the hairy black hole ( scalar bh ) , ( [ metric bh ] ) performing a double wick rotation  of the form @xmath85 , @xmath86 , with suitable rescalings and redefining the radial coordinate also turns out to be useful . ] .",
    "in fact , the euclidean black hole solution is regular provided the euclidean time period is fixed as the inverse of the hawking temperature in eq .",
    "( [ temperature and mass ] ) .",
    "hence , in order to obtain a different lorentzian solution without closed timelike curves , the ( former ) angle has to be unwrapped , and as a consequence the integration constant disappears by a simple rescaling .",
    "analogously , in the vacuum sector , one recovers ads spacetime from the btz black hole .",
    "note that since this construction is purely geometrical , it should apply quite generically to obtain solitons from black holes in three dimensions .",
    "this could also be interpreted as a manifestation of modular invariance of the dual theory at the boundary .    as a final remark",
    ", one can note that , as it occurs for the btz black hole , in the hairy sector there is also a gap between the ground state and the hairy black holes , and thus it is natural to wonder whether the hairy black hole could be obtained from some sort of identifications of the soliton .",
    "their possible local equivalence is suggested by the fact their scalar invariants constructed out from the curvature and its derivatives coincide .",
    "this can be easily seen as follows : since the hairy black hole is static and spherically symmetric , the invariants can only depend on @xmath1 , @xmath87 , and the rescaled radial coordinate @xmath88 ; therefore , since the soliton is obtained from this geometry by a double wick rotation which only interchanges the role of time and the angle , their scalar invariants are necessarily the same .",
    "nonetheless , it is simple to verify that the soliton admits no additional killing vectors apart from the manifest ones , generated by @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and hence the possible identifications can not be along an isometry .",

    "the soliton acquires a simple form . in the case of @xmath34",

    "( alpha and c ) .    note that the map between both frames ( [ map ] ) is invertible along the whole spacetime , since the conformal factor @xmath99 is positive .",

    "conformal symmetry at the boundary is described by two commuting copies of the virasoro algebra , so that left and right movers are decoupled , and hence they can be at equilibrium at different temperatures @xmath110 .",

    "<S> general relativity coupled to a self - interacting scalar field in three dimensions is shown to admit exact analytic soliton solutions , such that the metric and the scalar field are regular everywhere . since the scalar field acquires slow fall - off at infinity , the soliton describes an asymptotically ads spacetime in a relaxed sense as compared with the one of brown and henneaux . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the asymptotic symmetry group remains to be the conformal group , and the algebra of the canonical generators possesses the standard central extension . for this class of asymptotic behavior , the theory also admits hairy black holes which raises some puzzles concerning an holographic derivation of their entropy _ _   la _ _ strominger . since the soliton is devoid of integration constants , it has a fixed ( negative ) mass , and it can be naturally regarded as the ground state of the hairy sector , for which the scalar field is switched on . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption allows to exactly reproduce the semiclassical hairy black hole entropy from the asymptotic growth of the number of states by means of cardy formula . </S>",
    "<S> particularly useful is expressing the asymptotic growth of the number of states only in terms of the spectrum of the virasoro operators without making any explicit reference to the central charges . </S>"
