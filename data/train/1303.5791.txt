    "thermal fluctuations may excite spins at the boundary into the wrong magnetic phase , which still satisfies the in - plane interactions .",
    "if the correlations which form are short - lived , they will lead to quasielastic scattering .",
    "because the in - plane coupling is so much stronger than the out - of - plane coupling , fluctuations at in - plane domain boundaries may not be able to form correlated patches of any significant size , and so would not contribute to the observed quasielastic scattering .",
    "this would also explain the line shape of the quasielastic scattering : the shape of the domain walls would constrain correlations along the _ c _ axis , but correlations could grow to much larger size along the in - plane direction .",
    "the neighboring ordered domains will not only act to limit the size of the out - of - plane correlation length , they may also cause those correlations to decay faster than an exponential .",
    "a lorentzian line shape indicates correlations which decay exponentially with distance , while a gaussian indicates correlations which decay much faster than exponential .",

    "correlations could extend as a decaying exponential along the @xmath40 axis , so their model is still consistent with our hypothesis .",
    "we also hypothesize that the existence of quasielastic scattering in yttrium - rich _ _",
    "r__mno@xmath0  but not pure homno@xmath0  is due to the larger in - plane easy - axis anisotropy in homno@xmath0 .",
    "this in - plane anisotropy for mn@xmath6  moments gives rise to a spin gap which was measured by fabreges _",
    "et al . _ for both yttrium and holmium , who found a significantly larger gap for homno@xmath0  than for ymno@xmath0",
    "this anisotropy acts as an energy barrier to in - plane rotation , and so a large anisotropy may prevent the quasielastic fluctuations at the domain boundaries . further evidence for this interpretation comes from the polarized scattering measurements of roessli _ et al .",
    "_ , who found that the quasielastic scattering is due to spins fluctuating within the plane @xcite .",
    "out - of - plane fluctuations gave rise to inelastic scattering due to the easy - plane anisotropy , which is much larger than the in - plane anisotropy for all _ _ r__mno@xmath0 .",
    "the observation of quasielastic scattering in lumno@xmath0  is consistent with this interpretation , since the spin - wave dispersion measured by lewtas _",
    "_ had a vanishingly small gap indicating very little in - plane anisotropy @xcite .",
    "one possible objection to our interpretation is that the observed quasielastic scattering may simply be the spin - wave dispersion approaching zero energy .",
    "the spin - wave measurements by fabreges _",
    "@xcite do indicate that the dispersion is close to gapless for ymno@xmath0  at the ( 1,0,1 ) position , and in homno@xmath0  it has a minimum at either the ( 1,0,1 ) or the ( 1,0,0 ) , depending on the temperature , in the same place as the observed quasielastic scattering for ymno@xmath0  and ho@xmath4y@xmath5mno@xmath0 .",
    "however , the observation of quasielastic scattering at the ( 1,0,2 ) , where the dispersion should move to higher energy in ymno@xmath0  due to out - of - plane coupling , indicates that the quasielastic scattering is not simply a measurement artifact of a gapless dispersion , but is instead related to correlations matching an ordered magnetic phase , albeit the wrong phase .",
