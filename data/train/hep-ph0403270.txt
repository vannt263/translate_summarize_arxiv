    "while the case for nature to be supersymmetric is very appealing , the understanding of the way in which supersymmetry is broken is far from being established .",
    "the details of this symmetry breaking determine the susy mass spectrum and consequently the way in which susy will exhibit its existence at the lhc .",
    "an attempt to perform a virtually model independent search for a large class of possible susy final states is reported in this note .",
    "the outlines of the proposed wide - scope algorithm are presented in the next section .",
    "the widening of the scope of the search is achieved by dynamic adaptation of the algorithm to the peculiarities of the signal .",
    "such a procedure is likely to result in a reduction of the search sensitivity when compared to sophisticated dedicated analysis techniques like artificial neural networks ( ann ) , which are based on a prior knowledge of the signal characteristics but the deterioration is shown to be marginal and the algorithm performs significantly better than simple cuts .",
    "it is argued that a combination of the traditional model driven searches and the present wide scope procedure will allow atlas to conduct the most effective search for susy ( and probably other ) final states .",
    "these statements are substantiated by the mc studies that are described in the following sections .",
    "the exact nature of the expected susy final states depends on the details of the way susy is broken and is yet unknown . be it as it may",
    ", one has some general hints for the nature of such final states :    * very high mass : since susy particles must be heavy ( tevatron , lep ) ; * large missing energy : at least in all rpc models due to the existence of a neutral practically non - interacting lsp .    an attempt to construct a search procedure in the most general way possible , based on these hints ,",
    "is described in this note .",
    "the k - neighborhood algorithm @xcite was modified in such a way that it can cope with the task of finding small deviations from the simulated expectations , which might result from the presence of an unspecified signal . in the modified algorithm - the lsl ( local spherical likelihood ) @xcite -",
    "each event is described by n parameters and is represented by a point in a corresponding n - dimensional space , where the n axes correspond to the n parameters .",
    "the generic name for such a space is the _event - space_. the choice of parameters ( i.e. axes ) is crucial as it determines to which type of signal the analysis will be sensitive .",
    "this is the place where model dependence is introduced into the procedure .",
    "once the parameters ( i.e. the axes ) have been chosen one normalizes them ( usually the parameters are mapped in such a way that they are centered at zero and distributed between zero and one ) in order to remove the effect of variable scaling .",
    "next , one runs a simulation of all the relevant sm processes and places each of the simulated events in an event - space , which is named the _reference_ space .",
    "one proceeds then by constructing a similar event - space using all data events , this event - space is named the _data_ space .",
    "the essence of the algorithm is to look for local accumulations of events in the _data_ space , which are absent in the _reference_ space . in the lsl , in order to expose the existence of such a local high - density region each of the data events is placed inside the _reference_ space and an n - dimensional sphere is traced around it .",
    "the radius of this sphere is adjusted in such a way that it is the minimum that is required to contain exactly @xmath0 reference events , where @xmath0 is a predefined number .",
    "the radius of this sphere is then recorded .",
    "next a sphere with the same radius is traced around the same data event but this time this is done in the _data_ space and the number of data events that are contained in the sphere @xmath1 is determined .",
    "+ in the absence of signal one expects @xmath2 .",
    "if signal were present one would expect @xmath3 .",
    "+ in order to discern the presence of signal the quantity : @xmath4 is computed . a large value of @xmath5 , which is the parameter that quantifies the local deviation of the density of the data from the density of the background , is therefore , an indication for a possible existence of a signal .",
    "+ the numerical value above which @xmath5 can be considered large enough to constitute an evidence for the presence of a signal in the data is not well defined at this stage . in order to estimate this value",
    "one makes use of additional sm simulated events ( which are not used for the construction of the _",
    "reference _ space ) and construct a _null_ space , namely , data - like event - space in which instead of data one places sm simulated events ( without a signal ) .",
    "one can then repeat the procedure outlined above for the _ null _ space and get the @xmath5 distribution for the no - signal hypothesis .",
    "the actual value of @xmath5 as computed from the data , can now be compared with the null - hypothesis and acquire a meaningful statistical interpretation .",
    "+ figure [ first]b shows the @xmath5 ( for fixed @xmath0 = 21 ) distribution for the signal case ( upper red histogram ) and for a background case ( lower blue histogram ) .",
    "the peak at @xmath6 in the signal case is an artifact of the situation in which the n - dimensional sphere is located at the center of a well separated cluster of signal events .",
    "the sphere contains all the signal in the cluster and the radius is then artificially enlarged to include the required 21 background events .",
    "thus , the spheres around different data points inside this cluster contain the same set of background and , consequently , signal events . as a result",
    "the @xmath5 value of all the events in this cluster is roughly the same .     as a function of the size of the sphere ( @xmath0 ) for a typical background ( black line , lower band ) and signal ( red line , upper band ) events .",
    "b ) @xmath7 distribution for the signal case ( upper red solid histogram ) and for a simulated background , ( lower black histogram ) . note the long tail of high @xmath5 events in the signal plot .",
    "the small peak at large @xmath7 in the upper plot is discussed in the text . , title=\"fig:\",width=604 ] +    the size of the sphere , namely the numerical value of @xmath0 depends on the number of simulated events as well as on the shape that the signal cloud takes inside the event space .",
    "since the second factor is unknown the procedure is repeated for values of @xmath0 ranging from some minimal value @xmath8 ( 21 in the present study ) to some fixed value , say 5% of the number of background events in the reference space .",
    "the maximal attainable @xmath5 in the series of @xmath9 , is denoted by @xmath7 . + as mentioned above a large value of @xmath7 is a strong indication for the existence of a signal in the data .",
    "+ the variation of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath0 is shown in figure  [ first]a for typical background and signal event .",
    "since @xmath9 is strongly correlated with @xmath10 the maximum value of @xmath5 as obtained by this procedure is fairly stable .",
    "it is disadvantageous to evaluate @xmath5 at low values of @xmath0 since for such values the statistical error is large .",
    "it is equally disadvantageous to evaluate @xmath5 at high values of @xmath0 since then the radius of the sphere is large and one looses the locality nature of the analysis . + at that point one can select a fixed @xmath0 for which the attainable @xmath5 are large or continue with @xmath11 at the cost of having a variable @xmath0 .",
    "the results which are presented below have been obtained using the best @xmath12 attainable provided @xmath13 .",
    "the dependence of sensitivity of the analysis on @xmath0 is shown in figure  [ nb ] for the case of gmsb with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and a positive @xmath17 .",
    "one sees , that at small @xmath0 the performance is not very good because of the statistical fluctuations , while for large @xmath0 it decreases because of the limited number of signal events .",
    "the optimal @xmath0 in this case is found to be at about 60 .",
    "the whole sequence of steps is summarized in the following list :    1 .",
    "choose the parameters ( motivated by physics considerations ) ; 2 .",
    "apply a set of soft preliminary cuts ( to remove irrelevant events ) ; 3 .",
    "scale and normalize the events parameters ; 4 .",
    "form a _reference_ space from all relevant sm background processes ; 5 .   form some _null_ space by simulating additional sm simulated events ; 6 .",
    "apply the procedure that was described before , for obtaining the @xmath5 distributions to the _reference_ space and the _null_ space and obtain the distribution for @xmath18",
    ". the number of events in the _null_ space should be as large as possible ; is used . ]",
    "form the _data_ space using preselected data events ; 8 .",
    "apply the procedure that was described before , for obtaining the @xmath5 distributions to the _reference_ space and _data_ space and obtain the distribution of the data @xmath19 ; 9 .",
    "compute @xmath20 ; where n stands for the number of events with @xmath21  , and maximize this value by changing the value of @xmath22 .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=529 ] +",
    "while the algorithm which was described above can be used to search for any conceivable signal we study its performance here by applying it on various rpc susy simulated signals .",
    "this decision determines , as was discussed , the selection of parameters by which each event is described . on one hand one would like to have all the relevant parameters that one can think of , but",
    "on the other hand a large number of parameters will necessitates a huge number of simulated events and will make the procedure either slow or useless .",
    "hence , only 4 input parameters , with the highest separation power , were selected . in order to conform with",
    "existing analyzes two sets are used : one in which no requirement on the presence of leptons in the event is set ; and another one in which one lepton is required and its properties are included in the input parameters . the parameters for the no - lepton case were :    * @xmath23 - where @xmath23 is the missing transverse energy of the event ; + * @xmath24 - where @xmath24 is the transverse momentum of the most energetic ( transverse direction ) jet ; + * @xmath25 - where @xmath25 is the transverse momentum of the second most energetic ( transverse direction ) jet ; + * @xmath26 - where @xmath26 is total transverse energy of the event .    in the case of @xmath27 channel",
    "the 4 input variables are :    * @xmath23 - where @xmath23 is the missing transverse energy of the event ; + * @xmath24 - where @xmath24 is the transverse momentum of the most energetic ( transverse direction ) jet ; + * @xmath28 - where @xmath28 is the transverse mass of the lepton - missing momentum system ; + * @xmath26 - where @xmath26 is total transverse energy of the event .",
    "the sm processes that have been simulated ( using pythia ) for this study consist of the processes : @xmath29 ; @xmath30 ; @xmath31 ; @xmath32 .",
    "the equivalent luminosity was set to 10 @xmath33 and in order to keep the number of events reasonable , a @xmath34 cut of 200 gev ( via _ ckin(3 ) _",
    "@xcite ) was applied .",
    "the effect of this cut was checked later and verified to be of negligible importance .",
    "the signal was simulated using pythia @xcite  ( for mssm ) and isajet @xcite ( for gmsb and amsb ) .",
    "the detector response was simulated using a fast simulation program .",
    "the atlas tdr @xcite as well as some additional points were used in this study .    in order to reduce the number of background events in the various event spaces , a set of preliminary cuts",
    "was applied .    * @xmath35 : which is due to the presence of two lsp in each event ; * @xmath36 : this cut and the two that follow reflect the high mass of the expected susy particles ; * @xmath37 ; * @xmath38 ; * @xmath39 : this cut and the one that follows are based on the fact that susy events are expected to give rise to long cascade decay chains ; * @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the circularity of the event .    for @xmath27 analysis",
    "the presence of a lepton with @xmath42 and @xmath43 allows softening some of the cuts .",
    "the preliminary cuts were therefore :    * @xmath44 ; * @xmath39 ; * @xmath45 ; * @xmath46 ; * @xmath47 ; * @xmath48 : this cut removes most of the @xmath49 background .",
    "since the main goal of the present study is the investigation of the performance of the lsl algorithm no attempt to look for optimal preselection cuts was done .",
    "rather , the quantities that were used in @xcite are used .",
    "the sensitivity of atlas to predicted signals of several rpc susy models was estimated using the lsl algorithm . in the case of mssm and amsb , it was possible to compare the lsl sensitivity to conventional procedure .",
    "recently , a comprehensive evaluation of atlas s sensitivity to a mssm signal was performed @xcite . on top of introducing a new channel ,",
    "namely , the missing energy channel with no requirement on leptons , which proved to be the best search channel , this study also introduced a sophisticated automatic cut optimization procedure which is based on the simplex algorithm .",
    "figure  [ meall ] is a comparison between this technique in which the signal is simulated and cuts are optimized in numerous points and the lsl algorithm in which no simulation of the signal was used at all .",
    "+    figure  [ mssmlt]a is a similar comparison between the two methods when only events with no leptons are considered . a somewhat complementary case , namely the case when events are required to have one isolated energetic lepton is shown in figure  [ mssmlt]b .",
    "an attempt to combine these two searches was also carried out .",
    "such a combination , which is similar to the one applied in higgs boson searches at lep , is expected to lead to an improved sensitivity .",
    "however , the improvement which was obtained was only marginal .",
    "+    generally speaking one may conclude from these plots that the sensitivity of the two methods is comparable .",
    "yet one should bare in mind that * the lsl algorithm did not make any use of simulated signal*. for completeness sake the sensitivity of atlas for a mssm signal as estimated with the lsl algorithm for luminosities of 1 , 10 and 100 @xmath33 is presented in figure [ finalmssm ] .",
    "+     .,title=\"fig:\",width=529 ] +    a study of atlas sensitivity to possible amsb signal was carried out by barr , allanach , lester and parker @xcite . in order to extract a signal a set of quantities were selected and were subjected to various cuts .",
    "10 sets of such cuts were used for the various analyzes that have been done : 0-lepton , 1-lepton , 2-oppositely charged lepton etc .. in order to compare the lsl performance with this analysis while keeping the wide - scope approach , the _",
    "null _ and _ reference _ spaces that were used in the mssm case were used also here .",
    "no modification whatsoever was introduced except for the introduction of a simulated amsb signal into the _ data _ space instead of the mssm one .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath50 analyzes is shown in figure [ amsbcomp ] .",
    "+    the two analyzes are again comparable except for the right side of figure [ amsbcomp ] where the lsl performance is inferior to the conventional technique . this behavior is related to the number of events with large number of jets and the differences in their simulation between herwig ( used by @xcite ) and pythia ( background simulation in lsl case ) . note that the sensitivity region here is estimated by @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "+ for completeness a three - luminosity contour , with 1 , 10 and 100 @xmath33 is also given when the sensitivity is estimated with a more stable estimator , namely requiring @xmath53 where s and b are the number of signal and background events respectively .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=529 ] +    a similar procedure was repeated for the gmsb case .",
    "the lsl inputs were left unchanged and the estimated atlas sensitivity is shown in figure  [ gmsb ] .",
    "it is found again to be comparable to the one which was obtain with a naive set of conventional cuts  @xcite .",
    "+ the lsl is basically looking for deviations of the data from the sm expectation , as predicted by the simulation . as such it might be sensitive to the quality of the simulation .",
    "defects in the simulation can easily be misinterpreted as indication of a signal .",
    "some preliminary studies of the stability of the algorithm under artificial distortion of the simulation are described in appendix a.     +",
    "the lsl sensitivity was shown to be comparable to the one attainable by carefully adjusting the cuts to a signal of well - known characteristics .",
    "it is possible that a more sophisticated analysis , which is based on likelihood or artificial neural networks , will be superior to the lsl algorithm .",
    "yet one should bare in mind that * the lsl algorithm did not make any use of simulated signal*. hence , the lsl will be able to observe signals of unpredicted nature and once such deviation are exposed ; they will be studied using all available analysis tools .",

    "+ 0.5 cm differences between the data and the simulated signals trigger the lsl algorithm .",
    "such differences may indicate the presence of a signal but might result also from bad modelling of the detector and/or from bad modelling of the various sm processes . in order to evaluate the effect of the later sources few preliminary studies have been done .",
    "the first test checked the sensitivity to energy calibration .",
    "the energy of the measured events ( i.e. those in the _ data _ space ) was scaled down by 5% while that of the simulated sm ( the _ reference _ space ) was left untouched .",
    "the efficiency / purity of the signal selection procedure for a mssm signal under these conditions was compared to the one which was obtained under normal conditions .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ systematics]a +      another potential source of fake signal is mismodelling of sm processes . in order to evaluate the importance of this source of trouble the @xmath54 process",
    "was scaled down by 10% in the _ reference _ space , leaving the data richer in @xmath54 by 10% more that predicted .",
    "the efficiency vs purity performance curve of the lsl is shown in figure [ systematics]b .",
