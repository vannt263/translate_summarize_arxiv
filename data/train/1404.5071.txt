    "optimal power flow ( opf ) problem determines an optimal operating point for an electric power system in terms of a specified objective function ( typically generation cost per unit time ) , subject to both network equality constraints ( i.e. , the power flow equations , which model the relationship between voltages and power injections ) and engineering limits ( e.g. , inequality constraints on voltage magnitudes , active and reactive power generations , and line flows ) .",
    "while the opf problem is often augmented with security constraints that ensure robustness to contingencies ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the formulation considered in this research does not consider contingencies .",
    "the opf problem is generally non - convex due to the non - linear power flow equations  @xcite and may have local solutions  @xcite .",
    "non - convexity of the opf problem has made solution techniques an ongoing research topic .",
    "many opf solution techniques have been proposed , including successive quadratic programs , lagrangian relaxation , genetic algorithms , particle swarm optimization , and interior point methods  @xcite .",
    "some of these techniques are quite mature and capable of finding at - least - locally optimal solutions to many large - scale opf problems with reasonable computational burden .",
    "( for instance ,  @xcite and  @xcite report computationally tractable methods for finding at - least - locally - optimal solutions to security - constrained opf problems with approximately 3,000 and 9,000 buses , respectively . )    however , while typical local solution techniques often in fact find globally optimal solutions  @xcite , they may fail to converge or converge to a local optimum .",
    "see , for instance , the example problems and discussion in  @xcite as well as the five - bus system in  @xcite . for many of these problems , matpower s  @xcite default interior point solver with default options and a variety of initialization heuristics either fails to converge or finds locally optimal solutions .",
    "see also  @xcite , which reports on a study by the federal energy regulatory commission of convergence characteristics for a variety of commercial solvers , opf problem formulations , and initialization heuristics .",
    "recently , significant attention has focused on a semidefinite relaxation of the opf problem  @xcite . if the relaxed problem satisfies a rank condition ( i.e.",
    ", the relaxation is said to be `` exact '' or `` tight '' ) , the global solution to the original opf problem can be determined in polynomial time .",
    "prior opf solution methods do not guarantee finding a global solution in polynomial time .",
    "further , infeasibility of a relaxation certifies infeasibility of the opf problem , which is a capability not available with typical existing solution techniques .",
    "additionally , unlike local solution techniques whose convergence characteristics generally depend on a chosen initialization , the semidefinite relaxation provides the global solution regardless of the choice of initialization when the relaxation is exact . while not as mature as existing solution techniques , semidefinite programming approaches thus have substantial advantages over traditional techniques .    however , the rank condition is not satisfied for all practical opf problems  @xcite . for such problems ,",
    "the relaxation provides a lower bound on the optimal objective value but does not provide physically meaningful decision variables ( i.e. , voltage phasors ) .",
    "the bounds obtained from the semidefinite relaxation are often close to the global optimum and are therefore useful for many applications ( e.g. , calculating voltage stability margins  @xcite and determining the potential suboptimality of an opf solution that is only guaranteed to be locally optimal ) . however , determining both the globally optimal objective value and the globally optimal decision variables is important in many contexts .",
    "to address problems for which the rank condition is not satisfied , this paper presents _ _ moment relaxations _ _ that globally solve a broader class of opf problems than existing relaxations .",
    "building on the results of  @xcite ( many of which are independently studied in  @xcite and  @xcite ) , this paper describes a method for globally solving large opf problems by exploiting sparsity and only applying computationally intensive `` higher - order '' moment relaxations to specific buses .",
    "much of the related work in this area focuses on sufficient conditions for which existing convex relaxations are exact  @xcite . while the sufficient conditions developed thus far are promising , they only apply to a limited subset of problems .",
    "for more general cases ,  @xcite proposes a heuristic method for finding a global optimum that is `` hidden '' in a higher - rank subspace of solutions to the semidefinite relaxation .",
    "however , the semidefinite relaxation yields an optimal objective value strictly less than the global minimum of some opf problems  @xcite . for such cases ,",
    "other heuristics may obtain at - least - locally optimal solutions  @xcite with the optimal objective value of the semidefinite relaxation indicating the potential suboptimality .",
    "while deserving of further study , heuristics eliminate the global optimality guarantee that is one of the main advantages of the semidefinite relaxation .",
    "we propose an alternative moment relaxation that , when exact , yields the global optimum . using polynomial optimization theory  @xcite , moment relaxations globally solve a broad class of opf problems , including many problems for which existing relaxations are not exact .",
    "moment relaxations exploit the fact that the opf problem is composed of polynomials in the voltage phasor components and is therefore a polynomial optimization problem .    global solution of a broader class of opf problems has a computational cost . whereas the matrix in the semidefinite relaxation of  @xcite is composed of all second - order combinations of the voltage phasor components ,",
    "the moment relaxation s matrices are composed of higher - degree combinations .",
    "the semidefinite program for the order-@xmath0 moment relaxation of an @xmath1-bus system has a positive semidefinite constraint on a @xmath2 matrix , where @xmath3 ( i.e. , this matrix is composed of all combinations of voltage components up to order @xmath4 ) . for example , the moment matrices for the second- , and third - order moment relaxations of a 10-bus system have size @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively , as compared to @xmath8 for the semidefinite relaxation of  @xcite .",
    "thus , the computational requirements of the moment relaxations can be substantially larger than the semidefinite relaxation of  @xcite , especially for high - order relaxations .",
    "fortunately , experience with small systems suggests that low - order relaxations globally solve a broad class of opf problems , including problems for which the semidefinite relaxation of  @xcite is not exact . as an example of the effectiveness of the moment relaxations ,",
    "consider the 9-bus opf problem in  @xcite .",
    "matpower  @xcite with the default interior point solver and default solver options either fails to converge or converges to one of three local optima depending on the initialization .",
    "( the local optima have objective values that are 10.0% , 37.5% , and 38.1% greater than the global optimum . ) the semidefinite relaxation of  @xcite yields a lower bound that is 11% less than the global optimum .",
    "thus , an existing convex relaxation and a typical interior point technique both perform poorly for this problem while a second - order relaxation finds the global solution  @xcite .",
    "the capabilities of low - order relaxations for small opf problems are further described in  @xcite , which includes an exploration of the feasible spaces of second - order relaxations , and independently in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "however , large opf problems are computationally intractable even for low - order relaxations .",
    "solving existing semidefinite relaxations of large opf problems requires exploiting power system sparsity . using a matrix completion decomposition , existing semidefinite relaxations are computationally tractable for problems with thousands of buses  @xcite .",
    "nave application of related techniques for the moment relaxations  @xcite enables solution of systems with up to approximately forty buses .",
    "solving larger systems requires more judicious use of the higher - order relaxation . exploiting the observation",
    "that power injection `` mismatches '' typically occur only in small regions of realistic large opf problems  @xcite , this paper applies a higher - order relaxation to specific buses .",
    "this enables global solution of large problems . with standard semidefinite programming solvers , the proposed approach is successfully applied to opf problems with up to 300 buses for which the semidefinite relaxation of  @xcite fails to yield the globally optimal decision values .",
    "further improvements in solving larger opf problems may be achieved by combining emerging semidefinite programming solvers with the method proposed in this paper .",
    "selective application of the moment relaxation is independently proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the method described in  @xcite is limited to second - order relaxations of opf problems with less than 40 buses due to a computationally expensive subproblem and lack of concurrent exploitation of sparsity . after introducing the opf problem formulation in section  [ l : opf_formulation ] ,",
    "we describe the moment relaxations in section  [ l : msdp_overview ] .",

    "<S> convex relaxations of non - convex optimal power flow ( opf ) problems have recently attracted significant interest . </S>",
    "<S> while existing relaxations globally solve many opf problems , there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these opf problems . </S>",
    "<S> the moment relaxations are developed from the lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems . increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in `` tighter '' relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs . </S>",
    "<S> low - order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small opf problems for which existing relaxations fail . by exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher - order relaxation to specific buses , global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher - order constraints . with standard semidefinite programming solvers , </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions .    </S>",
