    "recently , mid infrared spectroscopy has been used increasingly as a tool for studies of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath5 , see sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) for a review ) .",
    "the presence of starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in ulirgs ( and coexistence in some of them ) has been known for quite some time , but the question which of the two dominates the luminosity has been difficult to answer because of the large columns of obscuring dust found towards the nuclear regions of these gas- and dust - rich systems .",
    "high sensitivity and complete coverage of the infrared spectrum by esa s infrared space observatory ( iso , kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) have considerably advanced the use of infrared spectroscopy to penetrate this obscuring dust , and to probe for the sources of the huge luminosity of ulirgs .",
    "fine structure line and aromatic emission feature observations with iso - sws and isophot - s of a sample of 15 bright ulirgs suggest that most ulirgs are predominantly starburst - powered @xcite .",
    "the pah method has been extended to a larger sample @xcite , allowing to probe for evolutionary effects expected in a scenario where starburst activity gives way to a quasar - like agn buried inside the ulirg @xcite .",
    "comparison of optical and mid - infrared spectroscopic diagnostics @xcite demonstrated surprisingly good agreement if optical liners are interpreted as starbursts .",
    "this finding also suggests that agn in ulirgs usually make their presence known optically at least in certain directions , instead of being fully embedded by large obscuring columns of dust .",
    "this paper presents the result of a solicited program in iso open time , which addresses two main issues only partly covered by previous work .",
    "first , and most important , at which luminosity does the transition from ` predominantly starburst - powered ' to ` predominantly agn - powered ' occur ?",
    "on one hand , the iso observations of genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and lutz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest that not only luminous infrared galaxies with @xmath6 , but also most ulirgs above this threshold are predominantly starburst powered . on the other hand , optical and mid - infrared observations of hyperluminous infrared galaxies @xcite support a previous consensus that agn dominate these hyperluminous systems ( but note the intriguing possibility that far - infrared peaks in some luminous agn may trace even higher star formation related luminosities , e.g. haas et al .",
    "the luminosity at which _ local _ ulirgs ( @xmath7 )  on average  switch from starburst to agn dominated is a quantity with implications for various fields ranging from the interpretation of sources found in recent submm surveys @xcite to explanation of the hard x - ray background @xcite .",
    "simple arguments based on the free fall time of the gas mass concentrated in the inner region of ulirgs and the nucleosynthesis efficiency suggest a maximum luminosity of a starburst event approaching @xmath8 @xcite , the limit depending on gas mass , spatial scale , and initial mass function properties .",
    "observational evidence is clearly needed . despite its size of @xmath960 sources , the ulirg sample presented by lutz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and rigopoulou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) is not optimal for this task : it is selected basically as flux limited at 60@xmath1 m and dominated by low to moderate luminosity ulirgs , because of the steep ulirg luminosity function @xcite .",
    "the preliminary analysis of lutz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in the mid - infrared and a recent study of veilleux et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the optical / nir infrared showed that the presence of agn in ulirgs increases with the luminosity of the object .",
    "however , these studies clearly call for improved statistics above @xmath10 in order to better determine the transition to agn - dominated systems .    the second issue addressed by this paper",
    "is related to the use of pah features as an agn / starburst diagnostic .",
    "mid - infrared spectra of most galaxies show the 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath1 m features attributed to aromatic carbonaceous material @xcite . among several popular designations for these bands",
    "will be designated hereafter by the terms pah ( polycylic aromatic hydrocarbon ) or uib ( unidentified infrared bands , because of remaining uncertainties on the precise nature of the aromatic carrier ) .",
    "groundbased observations of these features and a companion at 3.3@xmath1 m first demonstrated that their equivalent width is larger in starburst galaxies than in classical agns @xcite .",
    "iso spectroscopy has further strengthened this link by demonstrating the anti - correlation between feature strength relative to the continuum and the ionization state of the gas @xcite .",
    "spatially resolved isocam - cvf observations of nearby agn support this interpretation by showing the pah features contrast to be weak near the central agn but strong in the circumnuclear region likely dominated by star formation ( e.g. cen a , ngc 1068 : @xcite , circinus : @xcite ) . despite this solid empirical basis , special care is required in analyzing pah spectra of ulirgs for agn or starburst dominance .",
    "all components of the spectrum  continuum and emission features , agn or starburst  may be unusually obscured , and the limited wavelength coverage of isophot - sl spectra ( 5.8 - 11.6@xmath1 m observed wavelength ) makes continuum definition difficult . here , the extended wavelength range of isocam - cvf ( 5 - 16.5@xmath1 m ) is beneficial in reaching the long wavelength side of the broad 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption feature .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we discuss sample selection , observations and data analysis in section 2 . section 3 presents the observational results .",
    "section 4 establishes a new quantitative method to determine the contribution of starburst and agn activity to the mid - infrared spectra , and compares it with the method used by genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , lutz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and rigopoulou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss the properties of ulirgs as a function of luminosity , combining our sample with the results of the isophot - s sample and with isocam results on hylirgs .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 6 .",
    "the solicited observing program presented here was defined in the last third of the iso mission when it had become apparent that low resolution spectroscopy of ulirgs was a promising tool , and that studies of ulirgs needed to be extended towards higher luminosities .",
    "the sample selection is strongly driven by the visibility constraints of the iso satellite during the final six months of the mission .",
    "ulirgs were selected from the samples of fisher et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , kim ( 1995 ) , clements et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and the qdot sample ( lawrence et al . 1999 ) .",
    "six sources were chosen from these catalogues with @xmath11 that had reasonable iso visibility during the remaining mission , plus an additional ten slightly lower luminosity sources that could be accommodated within the available observing time .",
    "table  [ tab : sources ] lists basic properties of the sample galaxies . throughout this paper",
    ", we follow the convention reported by sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) to compute the 8 - 1000@xmath1 m luminosity @xmath12 , adopting h@xmath13=75kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 and q@xmath13=0.5 , and iras fsc fluxes ( iras 03521 + 0028 , iras 18030 + 0705 : psc ) .",
    "most of our sources are lacking detections in some of the iras photometric bands . in those cases , we replaced the missing fluxes by estimates based on the 60@xmath1 m fluxes and average colors of the sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ulirgs .",
    "the observations included the source iras 03452 + 2320 taken from the sample of fisher et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which is not listed in table  [ tab : sources ] .",
    "we did not detect a signal at its position .",
    "we believe this reflects an infrared cirrus related misidentification in the fisher et al .",
    "( 1995 ) sample rather than mid - infrared faintness of a true ulirg , since crawford et al .",
    "( 1996 ) failed to detect the same source in radio continuum .",
    "our sample is certainly heterogeneous : it was selected from ulirg surveys of different limiting 60@xmath1 m flux , with a preference for high luminosity targets but not implementing a strict lower cutoff , and strongly driven by iso visibilities .",
    "none of the selection criteria , however , should significantly bias our sample in mid - ir spectral properties or agn content .",
    "in particular , no agn - related iras color criteria like the 25/60@xmath1 m flux ratio were applied @xcite . a slight tendency towards favoring agn at higher redshifts / luminosities",
    "is induced by the 60@xmath1 m selection which is effectively at @xmath945@xmath1 m rest wavelength for the most distant targets .",
    "we have not attempted to correct for this since detailed far - infrared spectral energy distributions are unavailable for these faint iras sources , and since the effect will be negligible for our small and still fairly local sample .",
    "the sample is hence suited to study the agn content of ulirgs , bridging the gap between the lower luminosity ulirgs studied with isophot - s @xcite and the two hyperluminous infrared galaxies ( hylirgs ) observed by iso @xcite .",
    "figure  [ dist_lir ] shows the distribution of infrared luminosities both for our sample and the combined iso database .    the observations presented here used the circular variable filter ( cvf ) mode of the isocam camera @xcite rather than the isophot - s mode with which most other low resolution ulirg spectra were obtained and which is efficient in building a large sample of relatively bright sources .",
    "the ultimate sensitivity achieved in a long cvf integration time is better , and the need for stabilization overheads was no major concern for our moderate number of very faint sources .",
    "in addition , the extended long wavelength coverage is crucial in targeting objects up to z@xmath90.4 , and in probing an extended rest wavelength range .",
    "since our sources are expected to be spatially unresolved , we have chosen the most sensitive setting with 6 pixels and a total fov of about 3 .",
    "the observed wavelength range varies from source to source , the short end being defined by 5@xmath1 m rest wavelength and the long end either by 12@xmath1 m rest wavelength or , for high redshift sources , by 16@xmath1 m observed wavelength where the sensitivity of cvf observations starts to decrease quickly . in order to increase redundancy and to enable correction of the transients of the isocam detector , each cvf scan has been done in up and down direction . to reconcile the need for detector stabilization ( 10 frames of 5sec exposure at each wavelength ) with the total number of wavelength steps and practical limits on observing time , we have executed up- and down - scans with interleaved wavelength steps .",
    "the total observing time per source including overheads was typically 2.5 hours . each final spectrum is composed by about 120 wavelength steps and has an average resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "reductions have been carried out with the cam interactive analysis ( cia ) software .",
    "the dark current has been estimated with the dark model described by biviano & sauvage ( 1999 ) .",
    "this gives better results than using the two offset observations we have taken before and after the cvf observation .",
    "we used the multi - median resolution deglitching method @xcite to remove glitches , and then additionally deglitched manually a square of 3 by 3 pixels centered on the source . to correct the transient effect of the detector the inversion method developed at ias",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "the calibration of the flux was performed using the standard spectral response function of cia .",
    "appendix  [ psf_red ] presents a reduction scheme which allows to quantify the spectrum of a target , with its s / n ratio and the systematic error introduced by the reduction method ( the total uncertainty on the flux is about 5  mjy ) .",
    "it also allows us to determine the position of the fairly faint source with sub - pixel accuracy .",
    "the typical uncertainty of the position is 5 , including s / n and iso pointing uncertainty .",
    "one target ( iras 00406 - 3127 ) of the set had not been acquired by isocam because of a telemetry drop . for iras f02115 + 0226 there was no source detection .",
    "the s / n ratio observed for iras f02455 - 2220 is not high enough to reliably determine the psf correction described in the appendix .",
    "however , the observed spectrum can be taken as a lower limit , using only the signal from the brightest pixel .",
    "for the remaining 13 targets , the data reduction has been applied successfully .",
    "the rest - frame spectra for the 13 sources are shown in figure  [ results_spectrum ] .",
    "the shaded confidence area around the spectrum represents the rms plus the systematic error .",
    "table  [ tab : sources ] lists the position of the sources as obtained by the psf fitting method ( see appendix ) , and the iras fluxes .",
    "all targets were found to be point like sources at isocam resolution .",
    "one target has been found to be significantly offset from the iras psc position : iras 18030 + 0705 .",
    "the offset is about one arcminute .",
    "we checked the original iras data using xscanpi and found a source with fluxes similar to those listed in the psc , but centered on the isocam position .",
    "the origin of this position discrepancy is unknown .",
    "the fsc fluxes were adopted for the ulirgs detected by isocam except for iras 18030 + 0705 and iras 03521 + 0028 for which we used psc fluxes .",
    "> from previous studies , the following components are expected to be present in ulirg spectra , but not necessarily together in _ one _ spectrum :    * uib emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3 microns , mainly originating from star forming regions of the galaxies .",
    "this uib emission can be also coupled with a continuum of hot dust present in the most energetic regions of the starburst . *",
    "an agn continuum from the hot dust present in the vicinity of the agn , e.g. in a dust torus or at larger scale in the narrow line region . * strong absorption , both continuous and in features like the silicate 9.7 @xmath1 m one .",
    "absorption may arise either in the surroundings of the agn or the larger scale ism .",
    "the amount of absorption may be different for agn and for starburst .",
    "the silicate feature at 9.7@xmath1 m that is usually found in absorption may also mimic emission features . in dust configurations as in some torus models",
    "@xcite , self - absorbed silicate emission can create an emission peak near 8@xmath1 m that is superficially similar to a faint uib emission and may be observed in one hylirg @xcite .",
    "discrimination of such a ` fake uib ' peak and real uib emission has to rely on the detailed shape of the 8@xmath1 m peak and presence of the other uib features .",
    "table  [ tab : sources_rk ] summarizes the presence of the uib bands .",
    "about half of the targets exhibit a spectrum with at least the 6.2 , 7.7 and 11.3 @xmath1 m mid infrared bands clearly visible .",
    "the remaining targets do not exhibits all these bands , and two none of them significantly .",
    "it is striking that almost all the observed ulirgs show a strong feature at or near 7.7 @xmath1 m .",
    "iras f23529 - 2919 is an exception . here , the continuum might be so strong that it can dominate the emission of the 7.7 @xmath1 m emission band . also , the shape of the 7.7@xmath1 m feature is very different in two other galaxies from the typical uib band .",
    "iras 22192 - 3211 and iras 00275 - 2859 have a band which is broader than the one observed in a `` normal '' starburst galaxy . the signal to noise for iras 23515 - 2917 is lower",
    "so it is more difficult to draw a definitive conclusion .",
    "a strong continuum has been detected in the two former targets , which supports the presence of an agn in both sources .",
    "the change of the shape of the 7.7 @xmath1 m feature can be explained in two ways .",
    "the carriers of the uib might be processed in the agn environment , changing the shape of the spectral emission of these carriers .",
    "such changes in the shape of the 7.7/8.6@xmath1 m complex have in fact been observed in some ultra - compact regions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a `` fake '' 7.7 @xmath1 m feature could arise when one observes a high optical depth source with self - absorbed silicate emission .",
    "there is no agreement in detail , however , between the broadish 8@xmath1 m features in these ulirgs and the spectral shapes predicted by torus models @xcite .",
    "a further problem of a ` torus ' identification of these 8@xmath1 m features is that they are not observed in the spectra of template seyferts and qsos @xcite .",
    "another source , iras f00183 - 7111 , has a maximum near 8@xmath1 m which we do not ascribe to uibs .",
    "its spectrum is remarkably similar to some deeply obscured objects ( dhendecourt et al .",
    "1996 , ngc 7538 irs1 : d.cesarsky unpublished ) , showing a strong 5 - 8@xmath1 m continuum and an extremely deep silicate absorption .",
    "even an apparent `` 6.5 @xmath1 m emission '' is indicated in this object which is very likely the result of the absorption of water ice at 6 @xmath1 m and an absorption feature at 6.85@xmath1 m which is of unclear origin @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of iras f00183 - 7111 is thus dominated by a heavily absorbed ( agn ) continuum with a possible weak 7.7@xmath1 m emission , which might be either due to a classical uib or self - absorbed silicate emission . in total",
    ", it appears to be the only unambiguous example in our data for a type of source considered typical in the classical sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) scenario : an extremely obscured agn .",
    "the use of the line - to - continuum ratio of the 7.7 @xmath1 m band ( hereafter l / c ) as proposed by genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and lutz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to distinguish in the _ mid - infrared _ between starburst - dominated and agn - dominated ulirgs is based on evidence that a starburst galaxy presents strong uib features while agn presents strong continuum with a low contrast emission features in the nuclear part of the galaxy .",
    "this is suggested by ground based observations @xcite , iso spectroscopy @xcite , and iso spectro - imaging @xcite .",
    "this also implies that the uib luminosity of a galaxy scales with its star formation .",
    "recent studies tend to reinforce this idea : in spiral galaxies , the global h@xmath16 emission of the disk is correlated with the total mir emission of uib @xcite .    when using these features as tracers of the sources of the total ulirg luminosity , a further assumption is that the mid - infrared actually probes the active regions and not just a surface layer .",
    "this is not trivial since the active regions of ulirgs are small @xcite and dusty .",
    "depending on dust configuration , a major part of the luminosity could be hidden from mid - infrared view .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have addressed this problem using the starburst - type mid - infrared nebular spectra of ulirgs .",
    "for ulirgs , the ratio of the inferred starburst ionizing luminosity to the bolometric luminosity approaches that for template starbursts , indicating that more than half of the luminosity has been traced by the mid - infrared observations .",
    "similar analyses can be made using the luminosity of the pah features .",
    "rigopoulou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and genzel & cesarsky ( 2000 ) find that observed pah luminosities of ulirgs are well above those of lower luminosity sources , the ratio to bolometric luminosity being only a factor 1.4 - 2 lower than in starbursts .",
    "this factor is plausibly explained by the higher extinction in ulirgs and perhaps the effect of the more intense radiation field on the pah emission .",
    "we have tentatively repeated this comparison using the extinction correction derived from our fits described below , which however give only fairly uncertain extinction for individual noisy spectra .",
    "the mean discrepancy narrows down to a factor 1.2 .",
    "thus , the mid - infrared diagnostics are probing the major part of the luminosity .    for a narrow line and emission from a single region ,",
    "both line and continuum are obscured by the same amount .",
    "the width of the pah feature and the strong wavelength dependence of extinction at the onset of the silicate feature make the pah l / c less ideal . in some objects",
    "the absorption might be so strong that it can mimic a 7.7 band .",
    "there are , however , differences in shape and the l / c will normally stay below the cutoff of 1 adopted in previous papers .",
    "iras f00183 - 7111 is the only clear example in our sample .",
    "another technical point that has to be verified is the determination of the continuum under the 7.7@xmath1 m feature . in the l / c diagnostic , this continuum is deduced from the linear interpolation of the continuum levels at 5.9 and 10.9@xmath1 m , i.e. the l / c ratio is affected by the flux uncertainties at these wavelengths .",
    "this is also a systematic source of uncertainty since the 10.9@xmath1 m point is still within the silicate feature and does not probe a clean continuum .",
    "we have explored alternative methods in order to verify the robustness of the l / c ratio with respect to the systematic error induced in the 7.7@xmath1 m continuum determination .",
    "first , we constructed the `` narrow band '' ratio between the flux density at 7.7 and 6@xmath1 m .",
    "strong uib emission will create a high ratio which is not reached by a pure continuum unless it is unrealistically steep over this small wavelength interval .",
    "this diagnostic should hence identify strong uib emission easily but will face problems discriminating weak uibs from continuum slope variations .",
    "the strength of this diagnostic is to avoid any assumption on the shape of the spectrum in the region obscured by the silicate feature .",
    "figure  [ lc_nb ] shows the correlation between the l / c and f(7.7)/f(6 ) diagnostics seen for ulirgs and template spectra observed by phot - s @xcite , sws @xcite , and cam - cvf ( this paper ) . the dispersion in this plot",
    "is explained by the variation in continuum slope and the systematic error of the l / c discussed before .",
    "the good correlation of the two diagnostics supports the use of the l / c diagnostic to identify systems that are clearly starburst - like and show strong uibs . by definition of the f7.7/f6 diagnostic , figure  [ lc_nb ] can not test the effect of continuum placement uncertainty in the l / c method on measurements of faint residual uibs in agn - like systems . the line f(7.7@xmath1m)/f(6@xmath1m)=l",
    "/ c+1 is also overplotted in figure  [ lc_nb ] to indicate the asymptotic case where the continuum is flat .",
    "to investigate further how the different spectral components influence the mir spectrum of a galaxy , we created another diagnostic whose basis is a more physical parameterization of the spectrum .",
    "our aim is an empirical fitting procedure using the complete mid - infrared low resolution spectra to derive the contribution of the agn and starburst components to the mid - infrared spectrum . in a second step",
    ", results will be extrapolated to the bolometric luminosities .",
    "the fit is based on template spectra of dusty starbursts and agn , and applied to the whole set of ulirg and template spectra observed by phot - s @xcite , sws @xcite , and cam - cvf ( this paper ) .",
    "since absorption plays an important role for the spectra of dust - rich ulirgs , we incorporate the effects of absorption that is higher than in the templates . in principle , explaining the mid - infrared spectra of ulirgs is a problem of three dimensional radiative transfer requiring a consistent treatment of dust , ices , and pah features .",
    "considerable insight can be gained , however , from a simple superposition of a screen - obscured starburst and a screen - obscured agn .",
    "arguments in favour of this approach are : ( 1 ) the mid - infrared diagnostic reaches most of the active region .",
    "unknown more obscured sources will be minor contributors .",
    "( 2 ) the use of an observed agn template implicitly accounts for warm dust close to the agn .",
    "screen extinction is a reasonable first approximation for the effect of even more dust around the agn , since this dust will mostly just absorb in the mid - infrared consider here , and reemit in the far - infrared .",
    "( 3 ) an aggregate of star forming regions is in principle better represented by a case where emission and absorption are well mixed .",
    "mixed case extinctions are difficult to determine , however , unless there are probes measured at high s / n over a large range of optical depths , a requirement not met by our spectra .",
    "the screen case adopted here will give similar results for optical depths around one , fall short at higher optical depth , but be conservative in the sense of not inferring excessive starburst activity in uncertain cases .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , rigopoulou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and sturm et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that in the range of the 6 - 9@xmath1 m uib bands there is little variation in starburst mir spectra observed by sws and phot - s .",
    "starburst spectra present some variations at longer wavelength , however .",
    "( 1996 ) , noted that in some regions of ngc 4038/4039 the flux at 15 @xmath1 m can rise dramatically and dominate the mid infrared spectrum .",
    "it can be shown that the mir spectrum of starburst galaxies is the superposition of two components : one from photodissociation regions ( pdr ) and one from regions @xcite .",
    "the pdr component is responsible for the uib emission and the region for the hot dust continuum which becomes important at 12 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "this hot dust continuum is probably due to very small grains heated to temperature as high as 200k in some regions .",
    "this continuum is very faint at 7@xmath1 m @xcite , and is not really noticeable in the spectrum of the majority of starburst galaxies where the pdr contribution ( _ i.e. _ the uib contribution ) dominates in this part of the spectrum @xcite . for some dwarf",
    "metal - deficient starburst galaxies like ngc 5253 and iizw40 ( rigopoulou et al . 1999 , s.madden private communication ) , uibs are nearly absent .",
    "in such a case a strong featureless continuum will not be an agn signature .",
    "since ulirg are dust rich and not known to be metal - deficient this effect is likely not relevant , and we still consider a strong ulirg continuum with weak uibs an agn signature .",
    "as the ( rest)-wavelength range investigated in this paper is between 5 and 12 @xmath1 m , the contribution of the hot dust continuum from regions will not change drastically the spectrum of the starburst contribution .",
    "but one _ must _ keep in mind that strictly speaking a significant continuum at short wavelengths ( 5 - 8 @xmath1 m ) is not necessarily a tracer of an agn , but could reveal a higher weight on regions in the ism with respect to photodissociation regions . to break the degeneracy , one has to look at the continuum at 15 @xmath1 m since the continuum of an region is steeper than the continuum of an agn @xcite .    in the present model",
    "we assume that the template spectrum of a starburst does not change in a significant way between 5 and 12 @xmath1 m ( see section 4.2 for the self consistency of this hypothesis ) .",
    "* we have used the m82 sws spectrum as starburst template spectrum * , supposed to represent the standard line to continuum ratio of the uib seen in a dusty starburst .",
    "nuclear agn spectra have low contrast uib features and mainly present a continuum emitted by hot dust .",
    "obviously , when looking at the total spectrum of a galaxy hosting an agn , one naturally observes uib bands from circumnuclear star formation or from the disk of the agn host ( see for instance @xcite ) . *",
    "the agn spectrum itself can be described by an intrinsic continuum which can be well fitted by a power law of variable index * @xcite subject to absorption by dust especially in the region of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption feature .",
    "as discussed in the previous subsection , a continuum seen in the mid - infrared may also be due to regions . in the wavelength range considered ( 5 - 12 @xmath1 m )",
    ", there is a degeneracy between the agn continuum and a continuum coming from an region , although an continuum is usually steeper and fainter .",
    "our fit invokes a single ` continuum component ' including both possibilities of an agn continuum and an unusually strong continuum .",
    "we will come back to the degeneracy between these two types of continua when discussing fit results .",
    "because ulirgs are gas and dust rich galaxies @xcite , the extinction is expected to play a crucial role on shaping the spectrum of these galaxies , even in the mid - infrared ( see for instance arp220 , @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to test how dust obscuration can affect both uib dominated and featureless spectra @xcite .",
    "one can argue that mid - infrared ulirg spectra could be completely dominated by absorption , and that the 7.7@xmath1 m feature , which we identify as an uib , could result from a deep absorption of a flat continuum @xcite",
    ". this could be the case in the strongly absorbed galaxy f00183 - 7111 .",
    "we want to test more generally whether it is possible to produce an emission feature around 8 @xmath1 m by a power law continuum affected by an absorption law or whether a simple uib spectrum affected by absorption is preferred .",

    "the gc extinction law has a higher extinction level between 3 and 7@xmath1 m @xcite .",

    "this procedure is adequate since we cover only a limited wavelength range , and since the dust in front of the galactic center is close to the ideal screen case .",
    "this absorption law has two main peculiarities : a flatter absorption between 3 and 7@xmath1 m , and a narrower silicate feature than what the draine and lee curve predicts ( see figure  [ gc_ext ] ) .",

    "models of this class vary in extinction properties : the dust extinction law is either a `` pure '' draine and lee law , or a `` pure '' gc extinction law or a mixture of the two .",
    "* the second class allows different obscuration of the two components and is clearly more realistic .",
    "the two different contributions ( continuum and starburst ) are not necessarily located in the same physical region and therefore do not suffer the same extinction .",

    "the first conclusion is that the models presented in table  [ tab : mod_descr ] can give a reasonable fit for all ulirg spectra .",

    "a first result can be obtained from a comparison of the two classes of models for the mixed templates circinus and centaurus a. figure  [ comp_visu ] shows the obvious superiority of models where the extinction towards the agn is different from that towards the starburst . fully equivalent good fits",

    "the galactic center has been grouped with the agns since the very center shown here is also a continum source devoid of uibs @xcite .",

    "this better accuracy is not explained trivially by the increasing number of free parameters .",
    "model 2 which has the same number of free parameters as the ` good ' models 3a - c is clearly less successful .",
    "that means , more flexibility in the shape of the extinction does not improve the fit significantly , while invoking different extinction towards the starburst and agn does .",

    "the purpose of the threshold , however , is to identify the component dominating the bolometric luminosity and not just the 5 - 10@xmath1 m flux .",

    "given the modest sample size , it is difficult to assign an accurate value for the luminosity at which half of the sources are starburst and half agn dominated . from figure  [ lc_comp ] , this occurs most likely at luminosities @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "the trend from starburst dominance for most ` normal ' ulirgs to agn dominance at the highest luminosities now consistently emerges from a variety of indicators : mid - infared continuum @xcite , mid - infrared spectroscopy ( lutz et al .",
    "1998 and this paper ) , and optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the good agreement between optical and mid - infrared suggests that agn in ulirgs do not remain fully embedded for long but manage to break the obscuring screen at least in certain directions .",
    "the highest luminosity ` starburst - like ' systems appear well above our cutoff l / c of 1 , but below the l / c@xmath32 typical for starbursts and lower luminosity ulirgs . this can be interpreted in different ways .",

    "[ pres_mod ] ) describes the spectrum of a ulirg in terms of just two components : a uib - dominated starburst component and a continuum component which is either due to an agn or extra region contributions .",
    "if the relative weight of ` pdr - like ' and ` region - like ' components varies for different starburst conditions , as seen e.g. for different regions of the antennae galaxies @xcite , assigning the continuum entirely to an agn may be misleading .",
    "the nature of the continuum has to be investigated in more detail to quantify the fraction of energy radiated by the agn ( agn continuum ) and by star formation activity ( uib - dominated component plus region continuum ) .",
    "it is possible to break the continuum degeneracy by using the slope of the continuum ( laurent _ et al .",
    "the ratio of the fluxes at 6@xmath1 m and 15 @xmath1 m is different for an region and a continuum emitted by the dust ( torus ) surrounding an agn .",
    "dust in the inner parts of regions emits a mid - infrared spectrum that is steep over our wavelength range .",
    "this can be seen both in galactic regions @xcite and in extragalactic regions of particularly concentrated star formation , e.g. the star forming knot a in the antennae galaxies @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the continuum emitted by hot agn dust is much flatter in the mid - infrared , as shown by the examples of cen a @xcite and ngc1068 @xcite .    because of the presence of the uib emission and silicate absorption features ,",
    "the steepness of the continuum can be determined reliably only with sufficient wavelength coverage , ideally from 6@xmath1 m or less to 15 @xmath1 m ( rest wavelength ) .",
    "this condition is not met by the isophot - s spectra which form most of the iso database of low resolution ulirg spectra but cut at less than 11@xmath1 m rest wavelength for most ulirgs .",

    "it is instructive to discuss the case of arp 220 for which a full cvf spectrum is available @xcite .",

    "this suggests a strong but steep continuum as in the star forming knot a of the antennae , subject to even higher extinction ( see figure  [ arp220_knota_comp ] ) .",
    "the case is less clear for our spectra which do not extend to 15@xmath1 m .",
    "some spectra suggest a strong but steep continuum at the long wavelength end of a uib dominated spectrum ( e.g. iras 03521 + 0028 ) while others are fit by a uib dominated spectrum plus a flat continuum ( e.g. iras 18030 + 0705 ) . at the limited wavelength coverage ,",

    "our model can be used to better quantify the contribution of starburst and agn activity independent from the l / c criterion used earlier .",
    "we measured the mid infrared fluxes emitted by starburst and continuum contribution ( not dereddened ) integrated over the wavelength range 5 - 10@xmath1 m ( similar to the filter lw2 of isocam ) .",

    "[ res_mod ] . since we were not able to reliably break the degeneracy of agn and region continuum for our wavelength coverage and signal - to - noise ratio , we explored two extreme cases for the origin of the continuum , reality most likely being in between .",
    "the first scenario assumes that the continuum is coming entirely from an agn .",
    "the examples of region continua discussed above , however , clearly argue for _ some _ star formation contribution to the continuum .",
    "it is unlikely that an almost pure continuum spectrum is produced in this way . the only star - formation powered galaxies approaching this case are low metallicity dwarfs like ngc 5253 , an unlikely match to the ulirg situation .",
    "we hence have adopted the following second extreme scenario : all faint continua , defined as emitting less than 50% of the total 5 - 10@xmath1 m flux , are assumed to be due to star formation , while all stronger ones are due to an agn .",
    "figure  [ lir_mirfrac ] shows the median ratio of the energy emitted by the starburst component to the total energy emitted ( @xmath33/@xmath34 ) of ulirgs presented in table  [ tab : ulirg_ratas_lc ] and two hylirgs @xcite , versus the total infrared luminosity .",
    "a trend towards agn dominance at high luminosity is again clearly seen .",

    "aiming for a good cam - cvf spectrum including a reliable continuum , a main source of uncertainty is due to the point spread function ( psf ) . because the width of the psf changes with the observed wavelength , it is crucial to determine the observed total flux for each wavelength separately .",
    "this is easily done for bright point sources because it is easy to sum the observed flux over a large box ( typically 5 by 5 pixels ) or to fit the psf profile to the observed image . since our sources are point - like at cam spatial resolution , it is not necessary to consider the complex situation for extended sources . even for point sources , however , the psf correction is difficult if they are faint .",
    "then , only a few pixels around the brightest one have a significant s / n ( hereafter the brightest pixel will be called `` central pixel '' ) . in such a case , the s / n of the corrected spectrum obtained by summing over a box or fitting the psf profile is usually very low .",
    "a better s / n can be obtained just using the signal of the central pixel and applying a psf correction factor that varies slowly with wavelength .",
    "the main difficulty in determining this factor is to obtain the position of the source within the central pixel .",
    "this could be done by fitting a model of the psf to the observed images at each wavelength .",
    "but , because the s / n is quite low for the pixels around the central pixel , direct application of this method gives uncertain positions and a final spectrum where the s / n is low , comparable to the s / n obtained by summing over a box . in order to improve the s / n we adopted the following method :    in cia , theoretical psfs are available at every half micron of the isocam - cvf wavelength range , residual variations over such ranges are small .",
    "we divided the observed wavelength range into sub - ranges of one micron centered around the wavelength of a theoretical psf , and summed images corresponding to wavelengths in this range of one micron around the given wavelength ( i.e. about 10 images ) .",

    "this method improves the s / n , and the deduced position of the source in the central pixel is known with a better confidence level .",
    "we used this position and the psf to derive the correction factor from flux in the central pixel to total flux , which was applied for each image in the considered wavelength range .",
    "although this method gives a better position of the source , it is still ncessary to compute the systematic error introduced by this correction .",
    "the formal way is to compute the s / n for each pixel of the summed image , and then to use an inverse monte - carlo method to compute the s / n of the spectrum .",
    "another equivalent way which avoids a monte - carlo simulation is to consider the images used to obtain the summed image _ as guesses of a monte - carlo simulation _ .",

    "<S> we present low resolution mid infrared spectra of 16 ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) obtained with the cvf spectroscopy mode of isocam on board the infrared space observatory iso . </S>",
    "<S> our sample completes previous iso spectroscopy of ultra- and hyperluminous infrared galaxies towards higher luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the combined samples cover an infrared luminosity range of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> to discriminate agn and starburst activity , we use the agn - related mid - infrared continuum and the starburst - related 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3@xmath1 m mid infrared emission bands attributed to aromatic carbonaceous material . </S>",
    "<S> for about half of the high luminosity ulirgs studied here , strong aromatic emission bands suggest starburst dominance . </S>",
    "<S> other spectra are dominated by a strong agn - related continuum with weak superposed emission features of uncertain nature . </S>",
    "<S> our sample contains one unusual example , iras f00183 - 7111 , of an agn that is highly obscured even in the mid - infrared .    </S>",
    "<S> an improved method to quantitatively characterize the relative contribution of star formation and agn activity to the mid - infrared emission of ulirgs is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the ulirg spectra are fitted by a superposition of a starburst and an agn spectrum , both of which may be obscured at different levels . </S>",
    "<S> models in which starburst and agn obscuration differ are significantly more successful than models with a single extinction . </S>",
    "<S> previous results based on a simpler line - to - continuum measure of aromatic emission strength are confirmed , further supporting the robustness of the aromatic emission feature as a diagnostic of ulirg power sources .    as dominant source of the bolometric luminosity , </S>",
    "<S> starbursts prevail at the lower end and agns at the higher end of this range . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between mostly starburst and mostly agn powered occurs at @xmath2 to @xmath3 , and individual luminous starbursts are found up to @xmath4 . </S>"
