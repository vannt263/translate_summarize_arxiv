    "adiabatic potentials , created using a combination of radio - frequency ( rf ) and static magnetic fields , are promising tools for confining ultra - cold atoms in novel geometries and for use as beamsplitters in atom interferometry .",

    "the primary results presented in this paper are measurements of the population in each @xmath3 state for the finite depth and anharmonic potentials and measurements of the displacement of the curved - sheet potential for different frequencies of the rf magnetic field .",
    "an atom moving in the presence of static and rf magnetic fields experiences adiabatic potentials as long as there are no landau - zener transitions .",
    "these adiabatic potentials are provided by a spatially inhomogeneous static magnetic field which gives rise to a spatially varying detuning for the rf magnetic field . in the adiabatic potential ,",
    "the atom exists in a superposition of hyperfine or zeeman states , which is a stationary state in the rotating frame .",

    "a simplification of these equations is possible in our system because the interaction strengths between different @xmath3 states are nearly equal , and spin exchange rates are small compared to the rf rabi rate ( we estimate spin - exchange rates less than 10 hz ) .",

    "sources of atom loss may be landau  zener transitions to untrapped states @xcite ; three body recombination may also play a role because the non - adiabatic loading into this potential can transiently increase the density @xcite . because adiabatic transfer into the the 2d regime is quite slow , due to the low pendular trap frequencies of the @xmath54  potential , we expect obtaining a condensate in the 2d regime to be difficult without significant improvement to the heating rate .",
