    "the conduction mechanism can then be described as schottky ( sch ) , fowler - nordheim ( fn ) or as direct tunneling emission . while in the case of bulk - limited interfaces",
    "the conduction mechanism is determined by the electrical properties of the oxide near the interface as , for example , those imposed by the existence of traps and their energy levels .",
    "two examples of transport mechanisms influenced by the energy distribution and density of traps are the poole - frenkel emission ( p - f ) and the space - charge - limited conduction ( sclc ) . as an example of a device based on an electric - field - trap - controlled sclc mechanism we can mention ag / la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 interfaces  @xcite , while au / yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 interfaces show a pf conduction in a variable - range hopping scenario , with a pulse - controlled - trap energy level that determines their resistance switching properties .",
    "@xcite    in this way , different scenarios can be considered to explain the microscopic origin of the resistance change of the device , related to the particular choice of materials for the metal / oxide interface . as shown previously  @xcite , by using their isothermal iv characteristics that it is possible to distinguish if the conduction of the device is related to an ohmic behavior ( @xmath6 ) , or a space charge limited conduction ( sclc , @xmath7 ) , or a poole - frenkel ( pf ) , fowler - nordheim ( fn ) or schottky ( sch ) emissions [ @xmath8 . a simple way to enlighten the origin of the main conduction mechanism of a device is to plot as a function of @xmath9 the power exponent parameter @xmath10 , defined as @xmath11 , instead of trying to fit by trail and error their iv characteristics .",
    "@xcite this is because the typical conduction mechanisms through metal - oxide interfaces have a simple @xmath10 vs @xmath9 curve ( see fig .",

    "otherwise , the standard way to do it will require to analyze the qualities of the fits to the iv characteristics of multiple expressions to test . it should be noted that a good fit of the iv characteristics , which includes all the participating mechanisms , is essential in order to extract a flawless microscopic description of the physics behind these devices .    by considering previous works  @xcite ,",
