    "last year this method was applied to a determination of the additive mass renormalization for static quarks to third order@xcite . in this paper , we present a preliminary estimate of the mass renormalization for heavy wilson quarks .",

    "the third is finite volume effects , since the physical sizes of space - time used in the simulations are quite small .",
    "all of these effects may be removed or reduced by using twisted boundary conditions@xcite for the fields .",
