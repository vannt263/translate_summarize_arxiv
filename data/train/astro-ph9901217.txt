    "the investigation of coherent radio emission from the pulsar magnetosphere has attracted a great deal of attention ( cordes 1979 ; michel 1982 ; asso et  al . 1990 ) .",
    "a powerful collective emission occurs when relativistic electron beams with density @xmath0 1 per cent of the pair plasma density , scatter off coherently from concentrations of plasma waves ( cavitons ) ( benford 1992 ) .",
    "the role of collective plasma processes in the absorption and spectral modification of the radio waves is well known ( e.g. , beal 1990 ; krishan & wiita 1990 ; benford 1992 ; gangadhara & krishan 1992 , 1993 , 1995 ; gangadhara , krishan & shukla , 1993 ) .",
    "von  hoensbroech , lesch and kunzl ( 1998 ) have demonstrated that degree of linear polarization decreases with increasing frequency while the degree of circular polarization shows the opposite trend .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the role of stimulated raman scattering on the polarization of electromagnetic waves propagating in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we assume that the physical conditions in the pulsar magnetosphere are those of the classical standard model ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) which describes the generation of ultrarelatvistic beams of electrons / positrons and the creation of the pair plasma .",
    "the beams and the pair plasma are in relativistic motion along the bundle of open magnetic field lines that delimit the active region of magnetosphere .",
    "the stimulated raman scattering is considered as a parametric decay of the initial transverse electromagnetic ( pump ) wave into another electromagnetic wave and a longitudinal plasma wave .",
    "the physics of stimulated raman scattering in a plasma has been explained in many papers and books ( e.g. , drake et al . 1974 ; liu & kaw 1976 ; hasegawa 1978 ; kruer 1988 ) . in two ways , stimulated raman scattering may be important in the pulsar environment : first , it may act as an effective damping mechanism for the electromagnetic waves generated by some emission mechanism at the lower altitudes in the pulsar magnetosphere . at those altitudes , the resonant conditions for stimulated raman scattering , i.e.",
    ", the frequency and wave number matching might not be satisfied .",
    "this results in a short time variability which is generally observed in pulsar radio emission .",
    "secondly , it may provide an effective saturation mechanism for the growth of the electromagnetic waves provided that the conditions for the wave excitation by some mechanism are satisfied in the region where an effective stimulated raman scattering can take place .",
    "the first case can be simplified by treating the intensity of the pump is constant in time .",
    "then the nonlinear equations , which describe the wave coupling , become linear in amplitudes of the decaying waves , and the exponentially growing solutions will imply an effective energy transfer from the pump wave .",
    "this approximation breaks down when the amplitudes of the decay waves become comparable to the pump wave or when the amplitudes of the decay waves enter nonlinear stage , and start loosing energy due to some nonlinear processes such as wave - particle trapping and acceleration .",
    "the second case is more complicated , where stimulated raman scattering acts as a nonlinear saturation mechanism and the amplitudes of all waves may be of the same order .",
    "this case can be considerably simplified when damping of the plasma wave is very strong or if it leaves the region of the resonant interaction fast enough .",
    "we neglect the nonlinear stages of stimulated raman scattering and the development of langmuir turbulence , which leads to wave  particle trapping or quasilinear diffusion .",
    "if the pump is monochromatic , the growth rate of stimulated raman scattering can become very high , as in conventional laboratory laser - plasma interaction .",
    "however , in the case of pulsars the pump can be broadband , and in the limit where the bandwidth @xmath1 of the pump wave is much larger than the growth rate of stimulated raman scattering , we can use a random phase approximation for the statistical description of the interacting waves .",
    "tsytovich and shvartsburg ( 1966 ) have given a general expression for the third order nonlinear currents excited in a magnetized plasma .",
    "since the corresponding expressions are very complicated , the general case of raman scattering becomes very difficult to consider .",
    "however , one can make some useful simplifications , when considering stimulated raman scattering in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "first , in superstrong magnetic field , we can expand the currents in @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "second , if the pair plasma has the same distributions for electrons and positrons then some of the nonlinear currents cancel out , as they are proportional to the third power of the electric charge ( this cancellation is exact in the unmagnetized electron - positron plasma ) .",
    "third , all the three interacting waves propagate along magnetic field .",
    "this is an important but less justified approximation .",
    "it allows us to simplify the problem considerably , and to obtain a dispersion relation for stimulated raman scattering .",
    "the polarization of the pulsar signals appear to bear critically on the pulsar radio emission process and the emission beam geometry .",
    "one or more reversals of the sense of circular polarization has been observed in the intergrated profiles of several pulsars .",
    "however , in individual pulses circular polarization changes sense many times across the pulse window .",
    "further , it is important to determine whether the depolarization is a geometric effect or results from radiation  plasma interactions .",
    "there have only been very preliminary attempts to explain depolarization and microvariability using plasma mechanisms ( benford 1992 ) .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to derive the properties of natural plasma modes and to explore some possible implications concerning the interpretation of the observed polarization , notably large and symmetric circular polarization in some pulsars ( e.g. , psr b0628 - 28 , and 1914 + 13 ) . in  2 , we derive the dispersion relation for stimulated raman scattering of an electromagnetic wave , and give an analytical expression for the growth rate of the instability . in  3 , we define the stokes parameters and compute the polarization states of the scattered electromagnetic wave .",
    "the discussion of our findings is given in  4 .",
    "we begin with a model consisting of a pulsar with nonthermal component of radiation interacting with plasma in the emission region at a distance @xmath4  cm , ( neutron star radius @xmath5 km ) from the neutron star surface , where the magnetic field is about @xmath6  g. plasma particles may be all in their lowest landau level with no larmor gyration , however , plasma can have one - dimensional distributions of momenta along the magnetic field ( blandford 1975 ; lominadze , machabelli & usov 1983 ) .",
    "this is because the synchrotron loss time for the decay of the perpendicular component of momentum is always short compared to the transit time at the stellar surface for any velocity .",
    "the simplest model for the plasma is density declining in proportion to @xmath7 with no gradients in the distribution functions across @xmath8    the nonlinear interaction of radiation with plasma causes the modulation instability leading to enhancement of nonresonant density perturbations and the radiation amplification by free - electron - maser , which produces intense electromagnetic waves ( lesch , gil & shukla 1994 ; gangadhara , krishan & shukla 1993 ; gangadhara & krishan 1992 ) .",
    "since the frequency of these electromagnetic waves is close to the plasma frequency , they resonantly couple with the subpulse - associated plasma column in the pulsar magnetosphere and drive the stimulated raman scattering .",
    "consider a large amplitude electromagnetic wave @xmath9 with an electric field : e_i=_xi(k_ir - _it ) _ x+_yi(k_ir - _it+_i)_y interacts with the plasma in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we follow ruderman & sutherland s ( 1975 ) approach to estimate the density and plasma frequency of the plasma moving within the bundle of field lines . for the typical parameters : lorentz factor of primary particles @xmath10 and for pair plasma particles",
    "@xmath11 , magnetic field @xmath12  g , and pulsar period @xmath13  s , we obtain the particle number density n_o= = ^-3 and the plasma frequency _p=2_()^1/2 = ^-1",
    ".    the plasma in the emission region of pulsar magnetosphere may be birefringent ( melrose & stoneham 1977 ; melrose 1979 ; barnard & arons 1986 ; von hoensbroech , lesch and kunzl 1998 ) . in these models ,",
    "two modes of wave propagation is generally allowed in magnetoactive plasma : one mode is polarized in the @xmath14@xmath15 plane and other mode in the direction perpendicular to it . following these models , we resolve @xmath16 into two modes @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that they are polarized in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath14@xmath15 plane , respectively .",
    "it is well known from laser - plasma interactions that large amplitude electromagnetic waves resonantly interact with the plasma when the radiation frequency becomes close to the plasma frequency . since the two modes have different indexes of refraction ( mckinnon 1997 ) , i.e. , the response of plasma is not same for the two radiation modes , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath19 couples with the density perturbation @xmath20 and @xmath21 couples with @xmath22 in the plasma medium .    since the ponderomotive force is proportional to @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the coupling between the radiation and the density perturbations is nonlinear .",
    "hence the density perturbations grow up which lead to currents and mixed electromagnetic  electrostatic side - band modes at ( @xmath25 in turn these side - band modes couple with the incident wave field , producing a much stronger ponderomotive force , which amplifies the original density perturbation . hence a positive feedback system sets in , which leads to an instability .    the electric field @xmath26 of the electromagnetic wave scattered through an angle @xmath27 with respect to @xmath14",
    "can be written as e_s=_xs(k_sr - _st)_x+_ys ( k_sr - _st + _ s)_y .",
    "the propagation directions of incident wave @xmath28 and scattered wave @xmath29 are illustrated in fig .  1",
    ", such that @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 the primed coordinate system is rotated through an angle @xmath27 about the y - axis",

    "the components of equation  ( 7 ) are d_s_xs(_s)(k_s r - _s t ) = - _ xin_1 ( k_s r - _s t ) and d_s _ ys ( k_s r - _s t+_s ) = - _ yin_2 ( k_s r - _s t+_i- ) and d_s _ zs(_s ) ( k_s r - _s t ) = 0 , where @xmath39 and _s = _i -  , k_s = k_i - k . in quantum language these two relations may be interpreted as the conservation of energy and the momentum along the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "when these conditions are satisfied , stimulated raman scattering is exicted resonantly and the expression @xmath40 becomes the dispersion relation of the scattered electromagnetic mode .    if we cancel the instantaneous space and time dependent cosine functions on both sides of equation  ( 8) , we get d_s_xs_s = - _ xin_1 .",

    "it seems rather unlikely that the diverse behaviour of circular polarization can be accounted for by a single mechanism .",
    "both intrinsic emission and propagation effects seem possible .",
    "the strong symmetric type of circular polarization observed in some pulsars is most probably generated by propagation effects , such as the stimulated raman scattering .",
    "further simultaneous observations over a wide frequency range would be valuable in sorting out the importance of propagation effects .",
    "we are grateful to y. gupta and a. von  hoensbroech for discussions and comments .",
