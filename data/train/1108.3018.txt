    "rare decays of beauty mesons ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) are sensitive probes of new particles which arise in models beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the context of supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm ,",
    "the measurements of decays such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 provide important constraints on the masses of new particles which are too heavy to be produced directly .",
    "some recent analyses showing constraints on the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) can be found in @xcite . of much interest for the lhc experiments",
    "is the unobserved decay @xmath0 . due its distinct signature",
    ", this decay can be searched for by three lhc collaborations : lhcb , cms and atlas . as pointed out in @xcite",
    ", @xmath0 is a very effective probe of susy models with large ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 , and its importance has been emphasised in numerous studies .",
    "the upper limit on the branching ratio ( br ) of @xmath0 has been steadily reduced during run ii at the fermilab tevatron . as of the year 2010 , limits of the order of br(@xmath15 ( _ i.e. _ an order of magnitude above the prediction of the sm ) were obtained by both the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration announced a possible first signal @xcite , although with a low significance .",
    "this result has not been confirmed by the recent searches at lhcb @xcite and cms @xcite . these improved limits for br(@xmath0 )",
    "further constrain the susy parameter space , and we show in this paper that such constraints can be superior to those which are obtained from direct searches for squarks and gluinos . using a combination of the individual limits on br(@xmath0 ) from lhcb and cms @xcite , we present an updated study of the constraints in the context of five distinct susy models . our numerical analysis is performed with superiso v3.2 @xcite , and we study the following susy models : the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , non - universal higgs mass ( nuhm ) , anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) and gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) , all in the context of the mssm ; we also study a semi - constrained version of next - to - mssm ( nmssm ) .",
    "moreover , we consider an alternative observable which includes br(@xmath0 ) , namely , a double ratio of leptonic decays @xcite .",
    "the double ratio has no dependence on the absolute value of the decay constant @xmath16 , which is the main source of uncertainty in the sm prediction for br(@xmath17 , and it was shown in @xcite that this observable can provide competitive ( or even superior ) constraints on the susy parameter space . the main uncertainty in the sm prediction for the double ratio arises from the ckm matrix element @xmath18 , for which the prospects of precise measurements at high - luminosity @xmath19 factories are very promising .",
    "the final integrated luminosity of the operation of the lhc at @xmath20 tev is likely to be significantly larger than the amount which was anticipated at the start of the run , which could enable the sm prediction for br(@xmath0 ) to be probed .",
    "we discuss the expected sensitivity to br(@xmath0 ) as a function of the integrated luminosity , as well as the prospects for a measurement of a sm - like br(@xmath0 ) during the 7 tev run , and its potential implications .",
    "our work is organised as follows : in sections 2 and 3 we present a theoretical introduction to the decay @xmath0 and the double ratio respectively ; section 4 contains our numerical analysis of the constraints on various susy models that are obtained from the recent upper limit on br(@xmath0 ) ; in section 5 the experimental prospects for @xmath0 are discussed , and conclusions are contained in section 6 .",
    "it has been emphasised in many works @xcite that the decay @xmath21 is very sensitive to the presence of susy particles . at large @xmath14 ,",
    "the susy contribution to this process is dominated by the exchange of neutral higgs bosons , and very restrictive constraints are obtained on the supersymmetric parameters .",
    "the @xmath22 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath23 where the coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 parametrize different contributions . within the sm , @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "are negligibly small , whereas the main contribution entering through @xmath26 is helicity suppressed . in susy , both @xmath24 and @xmath25 can receive large contributions from scalar exchange , which was first pointed out ( in the context of a different decay , @xmath27 ) in @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions for the different coefficients can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 decay constant , @xmath16 , constitutes the main source of uncertainty in @xmath22 . as of the year 2009",
    "there were two unquenched lattice qcd calculations of @xmath16 , by the hpqcd collaboration @xcite and fnal / milc @xcite respectively , which when averaged gave the value @xmath29 mev @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xcite was updated in @xcite , which gave rise to a higher world average of @xmath30 mev in the year 2010 .",
    "recently , the etm collaboration announced its result of @xmath31 mev @xcite . at the lattice 2011 conference @xcite",
    ", new results by fnal / milc ( @xmath32 mev ) and the hpqcd collaboration ( @xmath33 mev @xcite and @xmath34 mev @xcite ) suggest that an updated world average would be lower than that of the year 2009 . in our numerical analysis",
    "we will use @xmath29 mev @xcite .    to study the constraints on the parameter spaces of susy scenarios",
    ", we use the newly released combined limit from lhcb and cms at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite : @xmath35 more details are given in section  [ sec : prospects ] . in order to take into account the theoretical uncertainties , in our numerical analysis we will use the following limit @xmath36 to constrain the parameter spaces of the susy models under consideration .",
    "the main uncertainty in the theoretical prediction of @xmath37 is @xmath16 . as described in section [ sec : bsmumu ] , @xmath16 is now being evaluated in the unquenched approximation by various lattice collaborations .",
    "the error ( which is currently around @xmath38 or less ) has been reduced over time , and the central values of @xmath16 from the various collaborations are in reasonable agreement .",
    "the prospects for a further reduction of the error are good . however , despite the continuing improvement in the calculations of @xmath16 our view is that it is instructive to consider other observables which involve @xmath37 but do not depend on the decay constants , and to compare the constraints on the susy parameter space with those which are obtained from @xmath39 alone .",
    "one such observable which involves @xmath37 , but has essentially no dependence on the absolute values of the decay constants , is a double ratio involving the leptonic decays @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "one such double ratio is defined by : @xmath42    the quantity @xmath43 deviates from unity by small corrections of the form @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the double ratio would be equal to one in the heavy quark limit of a very large mass for the @xmath46 and @xmath47 quarks , and in the limit of exact su(3 ) flavour symmetry ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "a calculation in @xcite gives @xmath49 , and subsequent works @xcite also give values very close to 1 , with a very small error .",
    "unquenched lattice calculations of the ratios @xmath50 and @xmath51 have a precision of the order of @xmath52 ( e.g. @xcite ) , from which it can be inferred that the numerical value of the double ratio is very close to 1 . in our numerical analysis",
    "we will take @xmath53 .",
    "importantly , the absolute values of the decay constants do not determine the value of the double ratio , in contrast to the case of br(@xmath0 ) alone in eq .",
    "( [ brbsmumu ] ) .",
    "instead , @xmath18 replaces @xmath16 as the only major source of uncertainty , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ doub - rat ] ) .",
    "information on @xmath18 is available from direct measurements of semileptonic decays of @xmath19 mesons , both inclusive ( @xmath54 ) and exclusive ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "moroever , global fits @xcite in the context of the sm give additional experimental information on @xmath18 . due to its different theoretical uncertainties , the double ratio is an alternative observable which includes @xmath0 , and can provide competitive constraints on susy parameters .",
    "a comparison of the constraints on specific susy models from the double ratio and from br(@xmath0 ) alone is of much interest because the theoretical input parameters @xmath18 and @xmath16 for these two observables are independent .",
    "such a comparative study was performed for the first time in @xcite , and it was shown that the double ratio can provide stronger constraints .",
    "in particular , the constraints from the double ratio are maximised ( minimised ) for smaller ( larger ) @xmath18 , while the constraints from br@xmath56 are maximised ( minimised ) for larger ( smaller ) @xmath16 .",
    "we will perform an updated study of these two observables using the recently improved bounds on br(@xmath37 ) from the lhcb @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations . in the previous study of the double ratio @xcite the value @xmath57 @xcite",
    "was used , which is an average of the exclusive and inclusive determinations of @xmath18 .",
    "we note that this world average does not include three recent measurements of @xmath18 , of which two are from the exclusive channel @xcite and one is from the inclusive channel @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of these measurements would only have a small effect on the world average , and so for simplicity we will use @xmath57 , as done in @xcite .",
    "we note that the exclusive determination of @xmath18 suggests values of @xmath18 which are below the central value of the world average .",
    "the exclusive determination of @xmath18 requires a theoretical calculation of one hadronic form factor @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is the momentum of @xmath60 ) . for @xmath61 one can use lattice qcd to calculate @xmath58 , while for @xmath62 non - lattice techniques must be used . in both regions of @xmath63",
    "the extracted value of @xmath18 is below the central value of the world average .",
    "the inclusive determination of @xmath18 , which does not have a dependence on lattice qcd , suggests values which are above the central value of the world average .",
    "prospects for precise measurements of @xmath18 in the inclusive channel are very good at high - luminosity @xmath19 factories .",
    "in particular , the method used in @xcite is a very promising approach because the theoretical errors are greatly reduced by employing a low cut on the momentum of the @xmath60 ( @xmath64 gev ) , which keeps @xmath65 of the phase space of @xmath66 .",
    "this anticipated experimental improvement in the measurement of @xmath18 bodes well for the double ratio as an alternative observable with which to constrain susy .",
    "it is important to emphasise that @xmath16 is currently known with greater precision than @xmath18 , and this may also be the case in the era of a high - luminosity b factory .",
    "however , we note that the central values of these unrelated input parameters plays a major role in determining which observable gives the stronger constraints , as will be discussed in our numerical analysis .",
    "the double ratio also has the attractive feature of using ongoing measurements of br(@xmath41 ) and br(@xmath67 ) .",
    "such decays are not usually discussed when constraining susy parameters ( although see @xcite for a discussion of @xmath41 in this regard ) , but increased precision in their measurements would enhance the capability of the double ratio to probe the susy parameter space .",
    "the decay @xmath68 alone is very sensitive to the presence of a charged higgs boson ( @xmath69 ) and provides a strong constraint on @xmath14 and the mass of @xmath69 in susy models @xcite .",
    "the experimental prospects for precise measurements of all the decays in the double ratio are very promising .",
    "the precision in the measurements of br(@xmath70 ) and br(@xmath71 ) will be improved at the ongoing bes - iii experiment @xcite , and at high - luminosity @xmath19 factories operating at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath72 gev ( and also possibly at energies in the charm threshold region ) .",
    "similar comments apply to the prospects for significantly improved measurements of br(@xmath67 ) and br@xmath73 . for more details about the calculation of these decays we refer the reader to @xcite .    in this analysis",
    "we use @xmath74 where @xmath75    the theoretical evaluation of @xmath76 gives @xmath77 where the main uncertainty comes from @xmath78 . to determine the experimental limit on the ratio @xmath79",

    "this shows that the analysis in the previous subsections does not correspond to a particularly optimistic choice of the input parameters .",
    "the next point we discuss here is the effect of @xmath109 in the double ratio .",
    "the constraints from @xmath109 alone on the parameter space of @xmath110 $ ] have been presented in several works ( e.g. @xcite ) and the excluded region differs from that obtained from @xmath39 alone , as can be seen in fig .",

    "fig : btaunu ] . on the other hand , in the small strip , br(@xmath109 ) is larger than in the sm . in the narrow region in between , a cancellation happens since the charged higgs contribution is roughly twice that of the sm contribution and so @xmath109 can not exclude this parameter space .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , @xmath39 probes larger values of @xmath165 than @xmath109 , although @xmath109 can exclude part of the region @xmath166 and @xmath167 gev which can not be excluded from @xmath39 alone and the double ratio .",
    "the reason why the double ratio is more constraining than @xmath39 alone is mainly due to two reasons : i ) @xmath18 is used as an input parameter in the double ratio , instead of @xmath16 .",
    "although these two parameters have comparable errors , their current central values give rise to stronger constraints from the double ratio , as discussed in the preceding paragraph .",
    "this could not have been expected , and a value of @xmath16 much larger than that preferred by lattice qcd would have ensured that @xmath39 alone had the stronger constraints ; ii ) the experimental value of br(@xmath109 ) , which enters the derivation of @xmath168 in eq .",
    "( [ ratio_eta ] ) , is larger than the sm expectation , and so reduces @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ r_doubrat ] ) , leading to a stronger constraint on the susy parameter space .",

    "when we manually set this scale factor to be equal to 1 ( as in the sm ) , the excluded region of the plane @xmath110 $ ] does not change much .",
    "therefore we conclude that the points i ) and ii ) above are the main reasons why the double ratio gives the superior constraints .",
