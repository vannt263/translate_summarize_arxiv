    "at bolometric luminosities above @xmath6 , infrared galaxies become the most numerous objects in the local universe ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these galaxies further subdivide into luminous ( lirgs ] ) , ultraluminous ( ulirgs ] ) , and hyperluminous ( hylirgs ] ) infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of these ir galaxies are interacting or merger systems , and this fraction seems to increase with luminosity @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the energy radiated by these sources is infrared emission from warm dust grains heated by a central power source or sources .",
    "the critical question concerning these galaxies is whether the dust is heated by a nuclear starburst , or an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , or a combination of both .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopic studies on a sample of ulirgs by @xcite , suggest that 70%80% of these galaxies are predominantly powered by recently formed massive stars , and 20%30% by a central agn .",
    "these authors conclude further that at least half of these ulirgs are probably powered by both an agn and a starburst in a 12  kpc diameter circumnuclear disk or ring .    in this paper , we present vlbi continuum and h  i absorption observations on the type-2 seyfert galaxy ngc  7674 ( mrk  533 , arp  182 , ugc  12608 ) .",
    "this galaxy is a nearby lirg with an infrared luminosity of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "optical observations of ngc  7674 show a nearly face - on spiral with an inclination angle of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this galaxy is classified as sbc pec @xcite .",
    "it is the brightest member of the well isolated hickson  96 compact galaxy group @xcite , which consists of four interacting galaxies with a mean heliocentric velocity of 8760  km  s@xmath10 and a low velocity dispersion ( @xmath11  km  s@xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "the two largest members in this group , ngc  7674 ( h96a ) and ngc  7675 ( h96b ) , are separated by a projected distance of 2.2  arcmin .",
    "the observed features in ngc  7674 , as revealed in optical images , can be accounted for by tidal interactions with its companion galaxies in the group @xcite .",
    "the very large array 15  ghz observations of ngc  7674 by @xcite showed a triple radio source with components defined as eastern , central , and western , but their 1666  mhz evn+merlin observations at 20  mas resolution only revealed the central and the western components .",
    "these authors identified the central component as the radio nucleus and the western component as a radio lobe moving outward through the interstellar medium .",
    "however , their 20  mas vlbi image did not reveal any clear jet structure connecting the central and the western components , which are separated by @xmath00.5  arcsec .",
    "merlin observations by @xcite at @xmath12 and 1.4  ghz also revealed a triple radio source consistent with the 15  ghz vla observations @xcite .",
    "single dish arecibo observations by @xcite at 3.3 arcmin resolution showed two clearly separated h  i absorption features that are blueshifted with respect to a wider emission line .",
    "the absorption lines have full velocity widths at 20% of 63 and 45  km  s@xmath10 , while the emission line has 344  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the two h  i absorption features are at @xmath08600  km  s@xmath10 and @xmath08546  km  s@xmath10 , respectively . however , the neutral hydrogen interferometric observations with merlin at @xmath13 and 32  km  s@xmath10 @xcite revealed a single h  i absorption feature against the central component with an optical depth of 0.21 and a velocity width of 114  km  s@xmath10 at half maximum , centered at 8623  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "no h  i absorption was reported toward the eastern or the western components in these merlin observations .",
    "we adopt a distance of 115.6  mpc to ngc  7674 , assuming @xmath14  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 . at this distance 1",
    "mas corresponds to 0.53  pc .",
    "the observations were carried out at 1380  mhz on september  15 , 2001 using nrao s very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the phased very large array ( vla ) , and naic s 305-m arecibo radio telescope .",
    "these observations constitute the first scientific use of the arecibo radio telescope with the vlba after the installation and the successful testing of the vlba4 recording system .",
    "two adjacent 8  mhz baseband channel pairs were used in these observations , both with right and left - hand circular polarizations , sampled at two bits .",
    "the first baseband channel pair was centered close to the frequency of the neutral hydrogen 21  cm line , which is at a heliocentric redshift of @xmath15 , or @xmath16  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the velocity coverage of each baseband channel was @xmath01738  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro , nm with 512-point spectral resolution per baseband channel , and 5.1  seconds correlator integration time .",
    "the total observing time was 12  hours , with the 305-m arecibo radio telescope participating for 140 minutes .",
    "table  1 summarizes the parameters of these observations .",
    "the inclusion of both the phased vla ( y27 ) and arecibo were essential in these observations in two respects .",
    "one is the overall image sensitivity ( the rms thermal noise level ) , and the other is the short to moderate - length sensitive baselines necessary to image large scale structures . while including the phased vla in the vlba improves the image sensitivity by a factor of @xmath02.4 , the sensitivity improves by a factor of @xmath07.1 when both the phased vla and arecibo are added to the vlba .",
    "this latter sensitivity improvement is achieved only during the time when arecibo is observing . in our observations , where arecibo participated for about @xmath17 of the total observing time ,",
    "the image sensitivity was @xmath04.2 times better than the vlba alone for the whole observing time .",
    "also , the 305-m arecibo radio telescope provided the 3rd sensitive short baseline in our observations , this baseline is arecibo ",
    "saint croix with 238  km length .",
    "the other two sensitive short baselines are the y27pie town ( 52  km ) and y27los alamos ( 226  km ) .",
    "short sensitive baselines are critical to image extended continuum structures as well as the h  i absorption toward these structures .",
    "data reduction and analysis were performed using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and the astronomical information processing system ( aips++ ) .",
    "along with the target source ngc  7674 , the compact source j2329 + 0834 was observed as a phase reference with a cycle time of 150 seconds , 100 seconds on the target source and 50 seconds on the phase calibrator .",
    "the source j2334 + 0736 was used for amplitude calibration , and 3c  454.3 ( j2253 + 1608 ) was observed as a fringe finder and used to determine the initial fringe delays and to calibrate the bandpass .    after applying _ a priori _ flagging and manually excising integrations affected by interference",

    "the delay solutions for 3c  454.3 were applied and a bandpass calibration was performed . to image the continuum of the target source ,",
    "its line - free channels were averaged to a single spectral channel with a total width of 14  mhz . the phase calibrator j2329 + 0834 was self - calibrated in both amplitude and phase and imaged in an iterative cycle .",
    "the self - calibration solutions of j2329 + 0834 were applied on the continuum data of the target source ngc  7674 . due to the high rms noise values obtained after applying the self - calibration solutions of the phase reference source to ngc  7674",
    ", we performed self calibration on the continuum data set of the target source itself .",
    "this resulted in a significant improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the self calibration solutions of both the phase calibrator and the target source were later applied to the line data , in which every two channels were averaged to increase the sensitivity .",
    "the resulting channel separation of the h  i data cube was 31.25  khz ( 6.986  km  s@xmath10 ) .",
    "the continuum emission was subtracted from the spectral - line visibility data using the aips task `` uvlsf '' .",
    "the spectral - line data were then analyzed at various spatial and spectral resolutions .",
    "deconvolution of the images in the continuum and line data sets was performed using the clark `` clean '' algorithm as implemented in the aips task `` imagr '' .",
    "optical - depth @xmath18 cubes were calculated from the h  i absorption image cubes and continuum images with a similar resolution as @xmath19 $ ] .    along with these observations , we also reduced and analyzed archival vla data of ngc  7674 from 1986 .",

    "the optical spectroscopic studies of @xcite indicate the presence of young / intermediate - age ( a few myr to a few 100  myr ) stars in the nuclear region of ngc  7674 , and the question we seek to answer at this stage is whether any of the emission structures we observe in the nuclear region of ngc  7674 could be related to starburst activity . for this purpose , we compare the expected star formation rates from h@xmath56 and ir emissions with the nonthermal radio continuum emission .",
    "the star formation rates will be calculated using a salpeter imf which has the form @xmath57 @xcite with mass limits 0.1 and 100  @xmath58 as given by @xcite , taking into account that the nonthermal radio emission would result from type ii supernova explosions that require stars with masses @xmath59 .",

    "the radio luminosity of these three components is @xmath65  w  hz@xmath10 , and it is all due to nonthermal radiation because of the mere fact that they are detected by our vlbi array .",
    "vlbi arrays , even with the extremes of sensitivity we were able to achieve in these observations , currently lack the sensitivity to detect thermal emission . to derive the sfr from the radio luminosity",
    ", we first calculate the supernova rate using the empirical relation of @xcite that relates the observed galactic non - thermal luminosity ( @xmath66 ) to the supernova rate @xmath67 : @xmath68 we derive @xmath67=0.86  yr@xmath10 .",

    "however , the sfr estimated from the luminosity of the three diffuse radio components in ngc  7674 is still greater than the sfr calculated from the whole ir luminosity of the nuclear region .",
    "thus , we conclude that these continuum components are more likely related to agn activity , with no strong indication for a nuclear or circumnuclear starburst in our vlbi results .",
    "our continuum results at @xmath0100  mas resolution ( figure  3 ) revealed the previously unknown continuum structures ne and sw .",
    "the overall shape of the continuum components in the nuclear region seem to form an s - shaped pattern . a detailed study on galaxies with similarly shaped radio structures",
    "was reported by @xcite .",
    "the authors point out that the orientation of a black hole s spin axis could dramatically change even in a minor merger , leading to a flip in the direction of any associated jet .",
    "thus , following their discussion , it is possible that the components ne and sw are jet structures that formed before a possible black hole merger in ngc  7674 .",
    "however , it is also possible that the interstellar medium could be diverting the outcoming jets from the agn and causing them to form the ne and sw structures and the overall s - shaped pattern we are seeing in ngc  7674 .",
    "the black hole merger scenario would imply that the agn may be located in the central component ( c ) .",
    "however , the few high angular resolution observations available on this source are not enough to identify the agn component in this galaxy .",
    "early 18  cm vlbi observations at 20  mas resolution @xcite tentatively identified the component c to host the agn , because of its brightness and proximity to the optical center of the galaxy . at a few mas resolution , the vlba observations at 2.3 & 8.4  ghz ( j.  f.  gallimore & c.  murray - krezan 2002 , private communication ) detected two of the three compact continuum features seen in the component c at 21  cm .",
    "these components seem to match the c1 and c3 structures seen in our 21  cm observations .",
    "the measured total fluxes at 2.3 & 8.4  ghz were noisy , and the derived spectral indices for the two components were neither flat , nor steep . for @xmath73 , these values were @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether either of these two components is hosting the agn .",
    "also , no information is available on the third structure seen in the central component . while it is possible that any of these compact sources could be hosting the agn , they could also be shock - like features formed because of the interaction between the jet and compact interstellar clouds in the nuclear region of ngc7674 .",
    "our observations reveal the details of the h  i absorption against the radio continuum emission in ngc  7674 both at high angular resolution ( @xmath29  mas , figures  4 to 7 ) , and low resolution ( @xmath76  mas , figures  8 to 11 ) . the h  i absorption at high angular resolution is composed of several features .",
    "the strongest h  i line is the only feature with a measurable velocity gradient ( figure  6-top panel ) .",
    "the p - v diagram in position angle 14@xmath77 ( figure  6-bottom panel ) , shows a velocity gradient of 1647  km  sec@xmath10  kpc@xmath78 . if this measured gradient is arising from h  i gas in a rotating disk or torus , then at a radius of 17.4  mas ( 9.2  pc ) , assuming a keplerian motion , the enclosed dynamical mass would be @xmath79",
    ". however , calculation based on the observed width of the hidden broad h@xmath4 emission line suggests a black hole mass in the range @xmath80 , assuming an optical depth for electron scattering between @xmath81 and 1 @xcite .",
    "this difference could be explained by a rotating h  i disk , with only a small section of it being illuminated by the background radio source .",
    "a similar explanation was put forward by @xcite .",
    "these authors further suggested that the rotating h  i disk should be edge - on , because of the non - detection of h  i absorption toward the western or the eastern components seen on merlin scale .",
    "however , our results clearly show h  i absorption against e and ne , and no absorption against j , w , or sw ( figure  8) . while a possible origin for the h  i absorption toward e and ne could be neutral gas in intervening clouds far from the nuclear region of ngc  7674",
    ", the almost face - on orientation of the galaxy and the velocities of the detected h  i features suggest that these h  i absorption lines also arise within an h  i disk or torus .",
    "thus , this rotating h  i disk around the central black hole should be inclined , i.  e.  should not be an edge - on structure .",
    "following the h  i torus model illustrated by @xcite which suggests the existence of dense neutral hydrogen clumps in the circumnuclear h  i torus associated with a central agn , it is very likely that the absorption features seen at both low and high angular resolution with velocity widths @xmath82  km  s@xmath10 arise from such clumpy structures .",
    "thus , the velocity gradient seen in figure  6 for the h  i feature with a width of 35.4  km  s@xmath10 at half maximum , could be due to turbulent motion or infall of a dense clumpy structure within the h  i torus , and not represent the rotational motion around the black hole .",
    "the absorption seen toward e and ne components could also arise in such h  i clumps within the torus .",
    "an indication for the clumpy h  i torus can be seen from the optical depths and the velocity widths of the various h  i components listed in tables  6 and 7 .",
    "the narrower h  i features ( i.e.  1 , 3 , 4 , i , ii , & iv ) , which also have higher optical depths ( @xmath83 ) , seem to represent the neutral hydrogen clumps in the torus , and the wider h  i components ( i.e.  2 & iii ) , which have lower optical depths , seem to represent the rotating h  i torus itself .",
    "using virial considerations , the enclosed dynamical mass estimated from the widest h  i feature ( @xmath84  km  s@xmath10 ) at a radius of about 10  pc is @xmath85 .",
    "this value is consistent with the dynamical mass derived from the hidden broad h@xmath4 emission by @xcite .",
    "observations of ngc  7674 with the bepposax x - ray observatory by @xcite resulted in an absorption column density of @xmath86 , which is derived from the hard x - ray spectrum . comparing this column density with the values listed in column 5 of tables  5 & 6 would suggest a spin temperature ( @xmath37 ) of at least 1000  k. such a high value could be expected for the h  i spin temperature if the absorption is actually tracing a warmer atomic medium in the agn environment @xcite , where the spin temperature can rise to several 1000  k before the hydrogen atoms are significantly ionized @xcite .    however , the neutral hydrogen absorption studies in seyfert galaxies by @xcite showed that the h  i absorption in these galaxies generally avoids the nucleus , and it is more commonly seen against other radio components .",
    "this suggests that the absorption in the x - ray could be tracing different foreground gas than the absorption at 21  cm , and explains the higher column density in x - ray compared to the 21  cm h  i absorption .",
    "this also suggests that the continuum structures associated with the h  i absorption , namely c , e , and ne , are jet structures .",
    "this possibility is further supported by the steep spectra of these continuum structures seen at low resolutions discussed by @xcite and in section 3.1 of this work .",
    "based on the preceding discussion , we speculate that the agn is located to the west of all the continuum structures that have h  i absorption associated with them",
    ". this picture would exclude the w and sw components as agn hosts , because of their steep spectra .",
    "hence , a possible location for the agn is in the j structure revealed for the first time in these sensitive vlbi observations .",
    "this implies that the two strongest sources , c and w , are possibly radio lobes or hot spots , with the agn located somewhere in between these two structures , but simply free - free absorbed at 1.38  ghz .      using the above model for the location of the agn and the nature of the c and w components , we can estimate the age of the agn in ngc  7674 . for this purpose , we follow the discussion in @xcite for non - relativistic high mach jets .",
    "the standard assumption is that the bulk of the kinetic energy supplied by the jet is l@xmath87=l@xmath88 , where l@xmath89 is the total radio lobe luminosity , and @xmath90 is an efficiency factor for converting bulk kinetic energy into radio luminosity .",
    "the value of @xmath90 is @xmath91 , but it is more likely to be considerably less ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "also , the jet must do work ( @xmath92 ) to expand the ambient medium , where p@xmath93 is the lobe pressure derived using the minimum energy argument and v@xmath93 is the volume of the lobe .",
    "for the central component in ngc  7674 , l@xmath94 , p@xmath95 , and v@xmath96 .",
    "the source lifetime t@xmath97 , which could be indicative of the agn lifetime , would be t@xmath98  myr .",
    "thus , the estimated age of the agn in ngc  7674 is few myr , which is approximately the age of the young stellar population reported by @xcite .",
    "we have presented the results of phase - referenced vlbi observations , using the vlba , the phased vla , and the 305-m arecibo radio telescope , of the 21  cm continuum emission and the h  i absorption in the central @xmath00.75  kpc of the type-2 seyfert galaxy ngc  7674 , which is also classified as a lirg .",
    "the inclusion of both the phased vla and arecibo was a key factor in the success of these observations .",
    "the low resolution continuum images reveal previously unknown structures in the nuclear region of this galaxy .",
    "the total vlbi flux density at 1380  mhz is 138  mjy , and represents only 60% of the total flux seen with the vla at a lower resolutions , suggesting the existence of diffuse emission not detected by our vlbi array .",
    "all the observed structures seem to be related to agn activity with no strong indication of a nuclear or circumnuclear starburst .",
    "the overall s - shaped pattern that the radio structures seem to form could be the result of the interstellar medium diverting the outcoming jets from the central agn .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility of a black hole merger that could result in a similar structural pattern .",
    "the high resolution images show at least seven compact sources in the components defined in the literature as central ( c ) and western ( w ) .",
    "their brightness temperature is @xmath99  k. these compact sources are probably shock - like features formed due to the interaction of the jet with interstellar gas .",
    "however , one of these compact sources may actually be hosting the agn .",
    "the currently available studies are insufficient to confirm such a possibility .",
    "future sensitive multi - frequency vlbi observations will be the most direct way to identify a possible agn component in the nuclear region of ngc  7674 .",
    "both low and high resolution vlbi images show a complex h  i absorption with several peaks .",
    "the detected h  i lines have column densities on the order of @xmath100  @xmath101 , assuming a spin temperature of 100  k. at low resolution , we distinguish at least four h  i absorption peaks detected against the central ( c ) , the eastern ( w ) , and the northeastern ( ne ) components .",
    "no h  i absorption was seen against the jet ( j ) , the western ( w ) , or the southwestern ( sw ) component .",
    "all these absorption features seem to arise in the h  i disk or torus associated with the agn . while the narrow features ( @xmath102  km  s@xmath10 ) could represent clumpy neutral hydrogen structures in the h  i torus , the widest absorption feature ( @xmath84  km  s@xmath10 ) may represent the rotating torus itself .",
    "if the widest h  i feature ( component iii ) is rotationally broadened by a massive central object , the implied mass is about @xmath2  m@xmath103 .",
    "this value of the derived enclosed mass is very consistent with the black hole mass calculated from the width of the hidden broad h@xmath4 emission line .",
    "the detection of h  i absorption toward some of the continuum components , and its absence toward others , suggest that the h  i disk or torus is inclined and not edge - on as previously had been suggested .",
    "the authors thank c. salter and t. ghosh for their contributions to the success of the arecibo part of these vlbi observations and their helpful suggestions for processing the arecibo data .",
