    "control of the tumble probability is based on previously - encountered signals .",
    "a drawback of this run - and - tumble strategy is that occasional runs in the wrong direction are wasteful .",
    "here we show that there is an operating regime within the organism s internal parameter space where run - and - tumble navigation can be extremely efficient .",
    "we characterize how the positive feedback between behavior and sensed signal results in a type of non - equilibrium dynamics , with the organism rapidly tumbling after moving in the wrong direction and extending motion in the right ones . for a distant source , then , the organism can find fast .",
    "navigation up a gradient succeeds by finding those directions in which signals of interest increase .",
    "this can be difficult when the size of the navigator is small compared to the length scale of the gradient because local directional information becomes unreliable . in this case ,",
    "cells  @xcite , worms  @xcite , larvae  @xcite , and even robots  @xcite often adopt a run - and - tumble strategy to navigate . during",
    "runs the organism moves approximately straight , collecting differential sensor information in one direction .",
    "tumbles , or reorientation at zero speed , enable the organism to explore other directions .",
    "signal levels are transduced rapidly to the motility apparatus through an internal state variable , so that increases in attractant transiently raise the probability to run longer ( and tumble less ) before a negative integral feedback adapts it back  @xcite .",
    "classically , averaging over many runs and tumbles results in a net drift up the gradient , although this is usually rather modest because of occasional runs in the wrong direction .",
    "we here focus on the positive feedback inherent to this strategy wherein motion up the gradient lowers the probability to tumble , which further boosts drift up the gradient .",
    "our analysis reveals an unstudied regime in which rapid progress can be achieved . .",
    "past theoretical studies of run - and - tumble navigation have mostly focused on what happens when adaptation dominates the dynamics ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this regime ,",
    "the internal state of the organism exhibits small fluctuations around its mean , and mean field theory ( mft ) can be applied to make predictions .",
    "this approach has been used to describe the motile behavior or populations of _ e. coli _ bacteria in exponential ramps  @xcite and oscillating gradients  @xcite . beyond the well - understood negative feedback - dominated regime",
    "there is a large portion of physiologically relevant parameter space where the positive feedback between movement and sensation dominates the run - and - tumble dynamics .",
    "agent - based simulations have shown that in this case large transient fluctuations can emerge in the internal state of an individual organism climbing a gradient , precluding the use of mean field approaches  @xcite . while systems of partial differential equations ( pdes ) can be integrated numerically to reproduce these dynamics  @xcite , a precise understanding of the role of the positive feedback in generating such large fluctuations and the impact of those on the performance of a biased random walk are fundamental questions that remain largely unanswered because of difficulties in obtaining analytical results .    here",
    "we develop an analytical model of run - and - tumble gradient ascent that preserves the rich nonlinearity of the problem and incorporates the internal state , 3d - direction of motion , and position of the organism as stochastic variables .",
    "we find that large fluctuations in the internal state originate from two key mechanisms : ( i ) the non - normal dynamical structure of the positive feedback that enables small fluctuations to grow , and ( ii ) a quadratic nonlinearity in the speed along gradient that further amplifies such transients asymmetrically .",
    "phase space analysis and stochastic simulations , we show how these two effects combine to generate a highly effective `` ratchet - like '' gradient - climbing mode that strongly mitigates the classic drawback of biased random walks : wasteful runs in wrong directions . in this regime",
    "an organism should be able to achieve drift speeds on the order of the maximum swim speed .",

    "linear deviations from the fixed point simply relax to the fixed point regardless of the initial direction of the run . thus runs up and down the gradient are only marginally different in length , resulting in small net drift ( fig  [ fig : fig2]d ) .",

    "@xmath116 is long near the source in a linear gradient , for example , and decreases linearly with distance from the source .",
    "simulations show that the cell initially climbs the gradient fast but later slows down as the gradient length scale @xmath116 increases and @xmath27 increases ( fig  [ fig : fig3]d - f ) . on the contrary , for a static localized source in three dimensions , @xmath116 is short near the source but increases linearly with distance from it ( methods ) .",

    "a hallmark of _",
    "e. coli _ chemotaxis is that , in absence of a gradient , run - and - tumble behavior adapts back to prestimulus statistics  @xcite .",
    "these robust properties of integral feedback control  @xcite remain in place in our study because the transients originate from non - normal dynamics around the stable fixed point .",
    "the boost from positive feedback described here is independent from other mechanisms that can enhance drift up a gradient    the fact that non - normal dynamics might be exploited to boost runs in the correct direction parallels recent findings in neuroscience  @xcite that suggest neuronal networks use similar strategies to selectively amplify neural activity patterns of interest .",
    "thus , non - normal dynamics could be a feature that is selected for in living dynamical systems .",
    "although we used bacterial chemotaxis as an example , our results do not depend on the specific form of the functions @xmath119 and @xmath120 they are increasing .",
    "therefore our findings should be applicable to a large class of biased random walk strategies exhibited by organisms when local directional information is unreliable .",
    "in essence , any stochastic navigation strategy requires a memory , @xmath2 , to make temporal comparisons , a reorientation mechanism , @xmath25 , to sample new directions , and external information , @xmath121 , relayed to decision - making circuitry through motion and signal amplification .",

    "<S> many organisms navigate gradients by alternating straight motions ( runs ) with random reorientations ( tumbles ) , transiently suppressing tumbles whenever attractant signal increases . </S>",
    "<S> this induces a functional coupling between movement and sensation , since tumbling probability is controlled by the internal state of the organism which , in turn , depends on previous signal levels . </S>",
    "<S> although a negative feedback tends to maintain this internal state close to adapted levels , positive feedback can arise when motion up the gradient reduces tumbling probability , further boosting drift up the gradient . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , such positive feedback can drive large fluctuations in the internal state , complicating analytical approaches . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies focused on what happens when the negative feedback dominates the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , we show here that there is a large portion of physiologically - relevant parameter space where the positive feedback can dominate , even when gradients are relatively shallow . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how large transients emerge because of non - normal dynamics inherent in the positive feedback , and further identify a fundamental nonlinearity that strongly amplifies their effect . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , this amplification is asymmetric , elongating runs in favorable directions and abbreviating others . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a `` ratchet - like '' gradient climbing behavior with drift speeds that can approach half the maximum run speed of the organism . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus show that the classical drawback of run - and - tumble navigation  wasteful runs in the wrong direction  can be mitigated by exploiting the non - normal dynamics implicit in the run - and - tumble strategy . </S>"
