    "<S> in the paper we investigate the continuity properties of the mapping @xmath0 which sends any non - empty compact connected hv - convex planar set @xmath1 to the associated generalized conic function @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath2 measures the average taxicab distance of the points in the plane from the focal set @xmath1 by integration . </S>",
    "<S> the main area of the applications is the geometric tomography because @xmath2 involves the coordinate x - rays information as second order partial derivatives @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the hausdorff - convergence implies the convergence of the conic functions with respect to both the supremum - norm and the @xmath3-norm provided that we restrict the domain to the collection of non - empty compact connected hv - convex planar sets contained in a fixed box ( reference set ) with parallel sides to the coordinate axes . </S>",
    "<S> we also have that @xmath4 is upper semi - continuous as a set - valued mapping . </S>",
    "<S> the upper semi - continuity establishes an approximating process in the sense that if @xmath5 is close to @xmath2 then @xmath6 must be close to an element @xmath7 such that @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath1 and @xmath7 have the same coordinate x - rays almost everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> lower semi - continuity is usually related to the existence of continuous selections . </S>",
    "<S> if a set - valued mapping is both upper and lower semi - continuous at a point of its domain it is called continuous . the last section of the paper is devoted to the case of non - empty compact convex planar sets . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the class of convex bodies that are determined by their coordinate x - rays coincides with the family of convex bodies @xmath1 for which @xmath2 is a point of lower semi - continuity for @xmath4 . </S>"
