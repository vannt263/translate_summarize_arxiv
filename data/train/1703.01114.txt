    "one of the main objectives of the researchers working in the field of laser - plasma interaction ( lpi ) _ is _ to couple more laser energy with the plasma ( or matter ) so as to obtain more energetic end - products , e.g. , energetic charge particles or intense radiations .",
    "therefore , it is of prime importance to know the underlying physical process ( collisional and collisionless ) by which laser energy is coupled to the plasma during the interaction .",
    "earlier experiments @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite have already reported various absorption processes , e.g. , linear resonance @xcite , anharmonic resonance @xcite , brunel heating @xcite , skin layer absorption @xcite , @xmath11 heating @xcite etc . , which often depend on parameters of the laser , and the plasma @xcite .",
    "for example , while passing through under - dense plasma ( where plasma frequency @xmath12 is less than the laser frequency @xmath13 ) an intense @xmath14-polarized short laser pulse can be absorbed by exciting wake - fields and instabilities @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in an overdense plasma with an under - dense pedestal , linear resonance absorption ( lr ) of @xmath14-polarized light may occur by meeting the resonance condition @xmath15 in a specific location of the density gradient .",
    "most often @xmath14-polarized light is used by experimentalists because of its ability to drive the plasma particles more efficiently , and relatively less attention is paid in lpi using @xmath16-polarized light .",
    "however , absorption of both @xmath16- and @xmath14- polarized light in plasma may happen through the electron - ion collision @xcite known as inverse bremsstrahlung ( ib ) if laser intensity is below @xmath17 .",
    "in this work , we concentrate on the absorption of a @xmath16-polarized laser light in a homogeneous , under - dense plasma - slab due to ib , since collisional and collisionless absorption processes are coupled together for a @xmath14-polarized light where it is difficult to know what fraction of the collisional absorption contributes to the total absorption .",
    "we are also motivated by some earlier experimental results @xcite of collisional absorption with @xmath16-polarized light which shows that fractional absorption @xmath1 of light ( i.e. , ratio of absorbed energy to the incident laser energy ) anomalously increases initially with increasing laser intensity @xmath0 up to a maximum value about an intensity @xmath9 , and then it drops nearly obeying the conventional scaling @xcite , i.e. , @xmath18 . although there are numerous analytical models @xcite which directly or indirectly describe conventional ( standard ) collisional absorption ( ca ) without the effect of background plasma , less attempts were made to examine above mentioned anomalous collisional absorption ( aca ) .",
    "recently , aca process has been explained in the low temperature regime ( @xmath7  ev ) by postulating a total velocity dependent coulomb logarithm @xmath4 ( where @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath19 are the thermal and ponderomotive velocity ) in an analytical model of electron - ion collision frequency @xmath20 @xcite and more rigorous kinetic treatment @xcite .",
    "however , to what extent this analytical approach is valid can _ only _ be answered numerically with self - consistent dynamics of plasma background under the laser irradiation .",
    "to this end , we have developed an one - dimensional electromagnetic particle - in - cell code ( henceforth we call it empic1d ) where variation of physical quantities ( charge density , current density , electro - magnetic fields ) depend only on the one spatial coordinate along the laser propagation direction while considering all three velocity components of charge particles . in a particle - in - cell ( pic )",
    "simulation a reduced number of computational particles is used to represent plasma , instead of a large number of actual physical particles @xcite .",
    "this technique reduces the computational load , and enables to study the dynamics of an actual physical system of large number of charge particles .",
    "sizes of these pic particles ( computational particles ) are typically on the order of a numerical grid , they can pass through each other during the interaction , and coulomb collisions do not naturally happen @xcite .",
    "for this reason , coulomb collisions are explicitly added in all pic codes . to include coulomb collision in our empic1d code a monte carlo ( mc ) technique proposed by takizuka and abe @xcite is adopted .",
    "recently , this scheme is used in the parasol electrostatic pic code @xcite to study kinetic effects in tokamak plasmas .",
    "it conserves total energy and total linear momentum before and after a collision event in the velocity space . in this work , with",
    "the monte carlo collision assisted empic1d code , for the first time we show the aforementioned anomalous absorption in an under - dense plasma in the low temperature regime similar to our earlier analytical works @xcite .",
    "thus we bridge the gap between the experimental findings , analytical models , and pic simulations .",
    "plasma is assumed to be pre - ionized .",
    "laser intensity is kept below @xmath21 so that relativistic effects are less important . for convenience , atomic units ( a.u . )",
    "are used unless mentioned explicitly , i.e. , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the electronic charge and mass , @xmath24 is the permittivity of free space , and @xmath25 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "this article is organized in the following manner .",
    "details of the empic1d code is given in sec.[sec2 ] , with appropriate benchmarking in the absence of collision . in sec.[sec3 ] we independently benchmark the monte carlo ( mc ) binary collision scheme .",
    "then we combine the collision module with the empic1d code , and study collisional absorption of a @xmath16-polarized light in an under - dense plasma slab in sec.[sec4 ] where a comparison is also made between simulation and theoretical results .",
    "a summary is given in sec.[sec5 ] .",
    "here we give only necessary details of the pic code . in pic a collection of physical particles",
    "is represented by a computational particle so that the charge to mass ratio @xmath26 of the computational particle remains same as that of a physical particle .",
    "the following maxwell - lorentz system of equations ( in the normalized form ) is solved numerically after the discretization in space and time : @xmath27 here , @xmath28 are the electric and magnetic part of the electromagnetic field , @xmath29 is the particle momentum corresponding to its velocity @xmath30 and position @xmath31 at a time @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the current density vector , @xmath34 is the speed of light in the free space .",
    "the scaling @xmath35 connects actual magnetic field @xmath36 with the scaled magnetic field @xmath37 .",
    "the other equations , namely , @xmath38 and the gauss s law @xmath39 are not explicitly solved in a standard multi - dimensional pic scheme , thus saving a substantial amount of computer time .",
    "however , @xmath38 is ensured by choosing a staggered grid , called yee mesh .",
    "the charge and current conservation follows from @xmath40 , thus ensuring @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath41 are calculated on the grid points .",
    "therefore @xmath42 field are interpolated to obtain corresponding fields @xmath43 at the particle ( particle charge @xmath44 and mass @xmath45 ) position @xmath46 using linear weighting scheme , and the lorentz equation is solved using the standard leap - frog method .",
    "the advantage of the scaling @xmath35 is that , it reduces equations and identical in form in the free space ( i.e. , when @xmath47 ) and the amplitudes of @xmath48 becomes comparable . from now",
    "onward , for convenience , we shall write @xmath49 in stead of @xmath50 unless mentioned explicitly . a typical cycle of the pic simulation is shown in fig.[piccycle ] which clearly depicts where the binary collision module ( the mc part ) should be incorporated .",
    "let us consider a _",
    "s_-polarized light ( propagating in @xmath51-direction ) with transverse field components @xmath52 .",
    "the physical quantities ( e.g. , charge density , current density , electro - magnetic fields ) are assumed to depend only on the space co - ordinate @xmath51 , while retaining all three velocity components ( @xmath53 ) of particles .",
    "components of eqn.- reads @xmath54 equation gives longitudinal component of the electric field @xmath55 in our case .",
    "it is important to mention that , the numerical implementation of our pic code is little different from some of the traditional 1d - pic codes , namely , em1bnd",
    "@xcite , lpic++ @xcite , but closely follow the implementation in pic codes psc @xcite , vlpl @xcite , vpic @xcite , osiris @xcite , and vorpal @xcite . in em1bnd @xcite and lpic++ @xcite , by performing addition and subtraction of eqn .",
    "and , and writing @xmath56 one finds @xmath57 ; where @xmath58 can be recognized as the two propagating solutions of the wave equation .",
    "the advantage in this traditional procedure @xcite is that the partial derivative @xmath59 can be written in terms of the total derivative in time w.r.t .",
    "an observer moving at a speed @xmath60 , leading to @xmath61 for a given @xmath62 , eq . is solved as an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) to obtain transverse fields @xmath63 , @xmath64 on the grid .",
    "it also allows larger time step @xmath65 .",
    "the disadvantage is that , the longitudinal component @xmath55 is obtained by solving the poisson s equation @xmath66 explicitly ( not from eq . ) , and it needs a separate algorithm than solving the transverse components .",
    "moreover , this traditional scheme is hard to extend in multi - dimensional case . in our empic1d code",
    "we use fdtd ( finite difference in time domain ) method for the solution of all field components ( both traverse and longitudinal ) , in stead of the traditional addition - subtraction method mentioned above .",
    "thus we use only one kind of algorithm for @xmath67 which is extendable to pic simulations in higher dimensions as in refs.@xcite . using fdtd procedure on the yee mesh , and assuming @xmath68 , @xmath69 , eqn .",
    ", , can be written as    @xmath70    to ensure numerical stability we take @xmath71 , which decides the time step @xmath72 for a chosen grid size @xmath73 . the dispersion due to the fdtd discretization",
    "is minimized by choosing sufficient number of spatial grids ( minimum 40 is taken ) per wavelength of light .",
    "vlpl like @xcite improvement , namely , dispersion free scheme we plan to include in future .",
    "the current density @xmath74 due to the motion of charge particles is computed using the `` explicit current conserving scheme '' by umeda et al .",
    "@xcite which satisfies @xmath40",
    ". thus we avoid explicit solution of the poisson s equation to obtain @xmath55 .",
    "we use `` perfectly matched layer '' ( pml ) absorbing boundary condition @xcite for the electromagnetic fields . for charge particles , however , depending upon physical situations , absorbing , periodic , and reflecting boundary conditions are used .",
    "the empic1d code is verified for different cases ( where analytical solutions exist ) :",
    "( i ) plasma oscillation and energy conservation ( without external light source ) , ( ii ) reflection of the laser light interacting with an over - dense plasma and corresponding field in the skin layer , ( iii ) transmission and reflection coefficient of laser light in an under - dense plasma , and ( iv ) interaction of light with inhomogeneous plasma and formation of standing waves . as a representative case , for the purpose of benchmarking ,",
    "here we consider only the last case .",
    "consider the interaction of a laser light with an inhomogeneous plasma which consists of an under - dense region and an over - dense region separated by a critical density ( @xmath75 ) surface , illustrated in fig.[airyfig ] .",
    "this problem was investigated analytically in refs.@xcite for time independent case .",
    "however its numerical verification with pic method is still rare in the literature .",
    "benchmarking of this problem _ alone _ can justify the correctness of interaction of laser field with under - dense and over - dense plasma in a single simulation run using empic1d .",
    "we assume that density variation of plasma is linear @xmath76 along the propagation direction @xmath51 of a @xmath16-polarized light described by @xmath77 .",

    ", light is reflected from the critical surface .",

    "desired steady state analytical solution may not be reached during the early time of interaction . the constant @xmath93 depends upon the amplitude and phase of the resultant wave at the vacuum plasma interface at a given instant of time .",
