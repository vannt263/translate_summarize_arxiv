    "epitaxially grown semiconductor nanowires ( nws ) have attracted large interest in recent years as means to fabricate nano - sized devices .",
    "they have been grown using various techniques like e.g.  molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) and metal organic chemical vapor phase epitaxy . often metal catalyst particles are used to initiate the growth .",
    "more recently , catalyst - free processes have been developed .",
    "the nws promise to assist in overcoming many of the limitations of heteroepitaxy .",
    "dislocations formed at the nw / substrate interface do not propagate along the nw axis , but remain at the interface or bend toward the free nw sidewalls.@xcite residual strain is released elastically due to the extreme aspect ratio of typical semiconductor nws.@xcite as a specific example , gan nws on si are virtually free of extended defects despite the very large lattice and thermal mismatch between these materials.@xcite furthermore , the spectral position of the donor - bound exciton [ ( d@xmath2,x@xmath3 ) ] transition in photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of gan nw ensembles is exactly the same as the one observed in strain free , bulk gan.@xcite in apparent contradiction , the linewidth of this transition exceeds values of 1  mev and is thus significantly above the value expected for material free of strain.@xcite recently , this minimum broadening invariably observed in the pl of gan nw ensembles has been proposed to arise from the random position of donor sites and the corresponding energy distribution of excitons bound to these donors.@xcite however , this intrinsic broadening mechanism can not account for the fact that the linewidth observed for different samples may vary significantly , and may also approach values in excess of the energy separation of the donor - bound exciton transition in the bulk and close to the surface .    here",
    ", we investigate the morphological and structural properties of two gan nw ensembles on si(111 ) exhibiting a pl linewidth differing by more than a factor of two . using x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , we determine the orientation distribution of the nw ensembles as well as their strain state . position and shape of the x - ray diffraction peaks contain information about the strains and sizes as well as the orientation distribution of the nw ensemble .",
    "both samples are found to be entirely relaxed on a macroscopic scale , but to possess a non - negligible micro - strain .",
    "gan nws are grown on si(111 ) substrates by plasma - assisted mbe .",
    "atomic n and ga atoms are supplied by a plasma source operating at 500  w and an n@xmath4 flux of 2  sccm .",
    "prior to nw growth , the si substrate is exposed for 5  min to an atomic n flux for nitridation , which results in the formation of a 5  nm thick si@xmath5n@xmath6 film . for sample  1 ( 2 ) ,",
    "gan nws were subsequently grown for 3  h at a substrate temperature of @xmath7c and n rich conditions , resulting in nw arrays with an average length of 1.0 ( 1.6 )  @xmath8m.@xcite high - resolution xrd measurements were performed at a temperature of @xmath9c using a panalytical x - pert pro mrd  system with a ge(220 ) hybrid monochromator ( cuk@xmath10 radiation with a wavelength of @xmath11   ) .",
    "the circles of the diffractometer are explained in ref . .",
    "the program epitaxy  was used for evaluation of the data .",
    "pl spectroscopy was performed using the 325-nm line of a kimmon he - cd laser for excitation .",
    "the pl signal was dispersed by an 80-cm horiba jobin - yvon monochromator .",
    "the spectral resolution of the setup was about 250  @xmath8ev .",
    "the investigations were done at a temperature of 10  k. tem specimens were prepared by mechanical lapping and polishing , followed by argon ion milling .",
    "tem images were acquired with a jeol 3010 microscope operating at 300 kv .",
    "figures  [ fig : sem1](a ) and ( b ) display top - view scanning electron micrographs of samples  1 and  2 , respectively",
    ". the azimuthal orientation of the nws , as seen by the direction of their facets , is quite regular although the interfacial si@xmath5n@xmath6 layer is not expected to grow epitaxially .",
    "the nws of sample  2 are distinctly thinner compared to those of sample  1 .",
    "coalescence of the nws is obvious for both samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : pl ] shows near - bandgap pl spectra of the nw ensembles displayed in fig .  [ fig : sem1 ] . for both samples ,",
    "the dominant line at 3.471  ev is due to the decay of the donor - bound exciton in strain - free gan.@xcite sample  1 exhibits a linewidth of 3.7  mev , more than twice larger than the one observed for sample  2 ( 1.6  mev ) .",
    "broadening of bound exciton transitions by their energy dispersion as a function of the distance to the surface is expected to be more important for thin nws , since the fraction of donors close to the surface increases quadratically with the diameter.@xcite in the present case , we would thus expect a narrower transition for sample  1 and not a broader one as observed experimentally .",
    "consequently , the additional broadening observed for this sample has a different origin .",
    "as hypothesized in the following , a highly probable source of this broadening is microstrain caused by coalescence .",
    "the two samples under investigation were fabricated at different substrate temperatures , which is known to affect both the nucleation density and the lateral growth rate .",
    "lower temperatures as used for sample  1 result in a higher nucleation density as well as a more pronounced tendency towards lateral growth during nucleation , thus resulting in larger nuclei .",
    "this scenario will inevitably lead to an enhanced coalescence in an early stage of nw growth , and significantly larger diameters of the final nws as indeed observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sem1 ] . the misorientation of the nws with respect to each other , as well as the dislocations accommodating this misorientation at the tilt or twist boundary,@xcite will introduce an inhomogeneous elastic distortion of the coalesced aggregate . simultaneously , the strain introduced at the coalescence junction is more difficult to relax in the thicker nws of sample  1.@xcite all these arguments would point towards a larger contribution of inhomogeneous strain to the pl linewidth of sample  1 , as also observed experimentally . in the following ,",
    "we examine this hypothesis using high - resolution xrd .",
    "the out - of - plane orientation distribution of the nws is determined from @xmath12 scans near the gan 00.4 reflection at several azimuthal orientations .",
    "the tilt of @xmath13 [ @xmath14 for sample  1 [ 2 ] are typical for gan nws grown directly on si(111 ) . a pole figure of the gan 00.4 reflection ( sample  1 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pole2 ] displays a nearly isotropic angular distribution of the tilt angles of the gan nws analogous to a fibre texture .",
    "figure  [ fig : twist ] demonstrates the dependence of the full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the peaks of @xmath15-scans ( circles ) performed using different reflections in skew geometry ( sample  1 ) at different tilt angles @xmath16 ( see @xcite for a sketch of the skew geometry ) including in - plane scans for determination of the range of twist of the nws .",
    "the full line shows the fwhms extrapolated by :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the fwhm of a peak in the @xmath15-scan for a reflection @xmath19 with a given tilt angle @xmath16 , and @xmath20 is the fwhm of a peak in an in - plane scan revealing the true range of twist of the nws .",
    "often a @xmath15-scan can be measured in skew geometry more easily than in an in - plane geometry , then @xmath18 is measured and @xmath20 can be obtained from eq .",

    "for both samples , coalescence boundaries will be the source of significant strain due to the broad orientation distribution of the nws .",
    "this is illustrated in figures  [ fig : tem ] and  [ fig : tem2 ] : fig .",
    "[ fig : tem ] shows a tem micrograph of the interface region of sample  1 , the gan nws on the si@xmath24n@xmath25 intermediate film .",

    "[ fig : tem2 ] demonstrates a high - resolution tem micrograph of the coalesced region of two gan nws ( sample 1 ) .",
    "the border acts as a small angle grain boundary and dislocations are formed in the vicinity to accommodate the tilt .",
    "the netplanes are locally curved due to the strain field of the defects .",
    "[ fig : tem3 ] shows as another example a high - resolution tem micrograph of an isolated crystal defect in a gan nw ( sample 1 ) .",

    "the local distribution of strain is visible from the contrasts on the micrograph .",
    "those strain contrasts mainly due to bending of the nws are found near the bottom of the nws and near the coalesced regions .",
    ", width=264 ]            to determine the macroscopic strain state of the nws , we first measured the lattice parameter of our si substrates by triple - crystal diffractometry @xcite . using an analyzer crystal in front of the detector , the angular positions of the incident and the diffracted beams are determined precisely in order to obtain the bragg angle .",
    "the necessary calculations for the substrate are performed in dynamical approximation @xcite .",
    "we thus obtained a value of @xmath26   .",

    ", these values agree with those reported in refs .   and for strain - free and pure gan .",

    "[ fig : rsm ] for sample  1 confirms the fully relaxed state of the gan nws , because the diffraction vector @xmath32 is pointing in radial direction from the gan 10.5 peak towards the origin of reciprocal space .",
    "the mosaic spread of the gan nws can be calculated from the width of the gan peak perpendicular to the radial direction .",

    "[ fig : sem1 ] ) .",
    "the widths of @xmath27 scans across the gan 00.n reflections with n@xmath37 increase linearly with the reflection order n , which is the result expected for broadening governed by micro - strain .",
    "the line shapes are nearly lorentzian , so that we obtain the breadth @xmath38 of the physically broadened profile @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the breadth of the apparatus function and @xmath41 that of the measured curve @xcite .",
    "small asymmetries of the peaks are neglected here .",
    "we assume that each gan nw is a coherently diffracting domain separated by air or a small - angle grain boundary in case of coalescence .",
    "these domains are tilted with respect to the interface and twisted around the surface normal by different angles reflected by broad peaks in the @xmath12 and @xmath15 scans .",
    "the @xmath27 scans , instead , are broadened due to the finite size of the nws and due to the inhomogeneous deformations inside the nws .",

    "the two contributions have to be added @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the strain.@xcite we can interprete this strain as the variation of @xmath35 spacing within the nws .",

    "this length is comparable to the nw length , but for sample  2 it is lower by a factor of five pointing to a smaller domain size inside the wires .",
    "the micro - strain @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) in the gan nws of sample  1 ( 2 ) is obtained from the slopes of the williamson - hall plots .",
    "these values describe the fluctuations of the lattice plane distances in the nws , not their average .",
    "we estimate an error of @xmath58 in the determination of the micro - strain .",
    "the inhomogeneous micro - strain is caused by residual defects in the gan nws like dislocations or even small angle boundaries arising after coalescence of the nws .",
    "@xcite     scan ) of sample 2 fitted with a lorentzian curve.,width=226 ]    the important result obtained here is the fact that the micro - strain for sample  1 is indeed considerably larger than that for sample  2 , just as the pl linewidths .",
    "a quantitative comparison of these values to the linewidth obtained in pl is , however , not straightforward .",
    "coalescence presumably generates a rather complex strain field , including shear strain , while we only measure the @xmath59-component of the complete strain tensor . to give an impression of the range of changes of the bandgap @xmath60 by a general strain with @xmath61",

    "it is clear that only a fraction of the strain measured by xrd manifests itself in the linewidth observed in pl .",
    "we believe that this finding reflects the presence of dislocations in the coalescence junctions .",
