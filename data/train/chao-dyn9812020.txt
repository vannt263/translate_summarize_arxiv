    "the diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) model was introduced in 1981 by t. witten and l. sander @xcite .",
    "the model has been shown to underlie many pattern forming processes including dielectric breakdown @xcite , two - fluid flow @xcite , and electro - chemical deposition @xcite .",
    "the model begins with fixing one particle at the center of coordinates in @xmath3-dimensions , and follows the creation of a cluster by releasing random walkers from infinity , allowing them to walk around until they hit any particle belonging to the cluster . upon hitting they are attached to the growing cluster .",
    "the model was studied on- and off- lattice in several dimensions @xmath4 ; here we are only interested in the off - lattice versions in two dimensions .    dla has attracted enormous interest over the years since it is a remarkable example of the spontaneous creation of fractal objects .",
    "it is believed that asymptotically ( when the number of particles @xmath5 ) the dimension @xmath6 of the cluster is very close to 1.71 @xcite , although there exists to date no accepted proof for this fact in spite of several interesting attempts @xcite . in addition , the model has attracted interest since it was among the first @xcite to offer a true multifractal measure : the harmonic measure ( which determines the probability that a random walker from infinity will hit a point at the boundary ) exhibits singularities that are usefully described using the multifractal formalism @xcite .",
    "nevertheless dla still poses more unsolved problems than answers .",
    "it is obvious that a new language is needed in order to allow fresh attempts to explain the growth patterns , the fractal dimension , and the multifractal properties of the harmonic measure .",
    "such a new language was proposed recently by hastings and levitov @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that dla in two dimensions can be grown by iterating stochastic conformal maps .",
    "we adopt their basic strategy and will see that it provides a new formulation of the problem which may lead to new insights and results .",
    "the basic idea is to follow the evolution of the conformal mapping @xmath7 which maps the exterior of the unit circle in the mathematical @xmath8plane onto the complement of the cluster of @xmath1 particles in the physical @xmath9plane .",

    "@xmath7 is related to the complex electric potential @xmath13 by @xmath14 where @xmath15^{-1 } ( z)$ ] is the inverse mapping .",
    "letting @xmath16 in eq.([eq - boundary ] ) it is easy to verify that eq.([eq - potential ] ) implies @xmath17 as it should be at @xmath18 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath7 is determined recursively .",
    "the choice of the initial map @xmath19 is rather flexible , and in this paper we select ( arbitrarily ) an initial condition @xmath20 .",
    "we expect the asymptotic cluster to be independent of this choice .",
    "then suppose that @xmath21 is given .",
    "the cluster of @xmath1 `` particles '' is created by adding a new `` particle '' of constant shape and linear scale @xmath22 t o the cluster of @xmath23 `` particles '' at a position which is chosen randomly according to the harmonic measure .",
    "we denote points on the boundary of the cluster by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an arc - length parametrization . the probability to add a particle on an infinitesimal arc @xmath26 centered at the point @xmath27 on the cluster boundary is @xmath28 the pre - image of @xmath27 and @xmath26 in the @xmath8-plane",
    "are @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . clearly",
    ", @xmath31 so the harmonic measure on the real cluster translates to a uniform measure on the unit circle in the mathematical plane .",
    "the image of the cluster of @xmath1 particles under @xmath32 is , by definition , just the unit circle . on the other hand ,",
    "the image of the cluster of @xmath1 particles under @xmath33 is the unit circle with a small bump whose linear scale is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the image ( under @xmath36 ) of the point @xmath37 on the real cluster at which the growth occurred .",
    "let us define now a new function @xmath38",
    ". this function maps the unit circle to the unit circle with a bump of linear scale @xmath39 around the point @xmath40 . for @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( with positive real proportionality coefficient ) . using @xmath43 the recursion relation for @xmath7",

    "the recursive dynamics can be represented as iterations of the map @xmath43 , @xmath47 this composition appears as a standard iteration of stochastic maps .",
    "this is not so .",
    "the order of iterations is inverted  the last point of the trajectory is the inner argument in this iteration . as a result",
    "the transition from @xmath7 to @xmath48 is not achieved by one additional iteration , but by composing the @xmath1 former maps eq.([comp ] ) starting from a different seed which is no longer @xmath49 but @xmath50 .",
    "we note that in the physical plane the `` particles '' are roughly of the same size . to achieve this the linear scales @xmath51 vary widely as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath52 .",
    "we will see that the distribution of @xmath51 and their correlations for different values of @xmath1 determine many of the scaling properties of the resulting cluster .",
    "in particular their moments are related to the generalized dimensions of the harmonic measure .",
    "there are many functions @xmath53 which conformally map the unit circle to the unit circle with a bump .",
    "a simple choice is a function which behaves linearly for large @xmath8 and has a simple pole inside the unit circle which will induce a bump in the image .",
    "the pole has to be at @xmath54 in order to localize the bump near @xmath55 and make it of linear size of the order @xmath56 .",
    "the residue has to be @xmath57 , in order for the bump s height to be also of the order @xmath56 .",
    "consider then @xmath58 careful thinking leads to the conclusion that this function and other similar functions are inappropriate : they have long `` tails '' . in other words ,",
    "the unit circle is slightly distorted everywhere .",
    "this small global distortion may result in a loss of conformality or in the growth of non - constant size particles in the physical plane in numerical applications .",
    "it was proposed in ref .",

    "the parameter @xmath60 is confined in the range @xmath61 .",
    "as @xmath60 decreases the bump becomes flatter , with the identity map obtained for @xmath62 .",
    "as @xmath60 increases towards unity the bump becomes elongated normally to the unit circle , with a limit of becoming a line ( `` strike '' in the language of @xcite ) when @xmath63 .",
    "naively one might think that the shape of the individual particle is irrelevant for the large scale fractal statistics ; we will see that this is not the case .",
    "the dependence on @xmath60 is important and needs to be taken into account .",
    "notice that this map has two branch points on the unit circle .",
    "the advantage of this is that the bump is strongly localized . on the other hand repeated iterations of this map",
    "leads to rather complex analytic structure .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore to investigate the scaling and statistical properties of such iterated stochastic conformal maps with a view to discovering the scaling properties induced by the dynamics which any analytic theory must ultimately explain . in section",
    "ii we present the numerical procedure used to generate the fractal clusters , and in section iii give the necessary mathematical background to describe such mappings .",
    "in particular we discuss the laurent expansion of the conformal map from the unit circle to the @xmath1-particle cluster ; the coefficients of the laurent series have interesting scaling behavior with the size of the cluster which is intimately related to the fractal dimension of the cluster and to the generalized dimensions of the harmonic measure . in section",
    "iv we present numerical results regarding the scaling properties of averages of the laurent coefficients and of the size parameter @xmath64 .",
    "the results are accompanied by a theoretical analysis and interpretation . in section",
    "v we conclude with some remarks on the road ahead .",
    "the algorithm simulating the growth of the cluster is based on ref .",
    "@xcite . the @xmath1 `` particle '' cluster",
    "is encoded by the series of pairs @xmath65 .",

    "then compute @xmath64 from eq.([eq - lambda ] ) , where the derivative of the iterated function @xmath70 involves @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 etc , computed respectively at the points @xmath74 , etc .",
    "notice that the evaluation of both @xmath75 and @xmath2 after the addition of one particle involves @xmath76 operations since the seed changes at every @xmath1 .",
    "this translates into @xmath77 time complexity for the growth of an @xmath1-particle cluster .",
    "this is inferior to the best algorithms to grow dla ( using hierarchical maps @xcite , with close to linear efficiency ) , but the present algorithm is not aimed at efficiency . rather , it is used since the laplacian field and the growth probability which is derived from it are readily available at every point of the cluster and away from it . the typical time to grow",
    "a 10,000 particle cluster is 8 minutes on a 300 mhz pentium - ii .",
    "naively one would expect that any choice of @xmath61 would yield dla clusters , since @xmath60 only determines the shape of the particles ( the aspect ratio is @xmath78 for small @xmath79 ) , and the microscopic details of the particles ( except their linear size ) should not affect the global properties .",
    "three typical clusters with particles of various aspect ratios @xmath60 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - clusters ] .",
    "we mark in black the interior of the image of the unit circle under the conformal map @xmath7 .",
    "the objects look very much like typical dla clusters grown by standard off - lattice techniques , and in the next section we demonstrate that they have fractal dimensions in close agreement with the latter . for @xmath60 significantly different from @xmath80 , disadvantages of the algorithm get amplified . since the functional form of @xmath2 is fixed ( only the size and position of the `` bump '' change ) , particles of constant shape and size are obtained only if the magnification factor @xmath81 ( the inverse of the field ) is approximately constant in the @xmath8plane around the `` bump '' of @xmath2 . if the particles are elongated along the cluster , then the variation of the field along the cluster affects the shape : large otherwise deeply invaginated regions , where @xmath82 is large , are filled up with a single particle , and the resulting cluster tends to be more compact .",
    "this effect , slightly noticeable even at @xmath83 , is quite significant at the otherwise natural choice of @xmath84 , where the particles are half circles . in fig .",
    "fig - clusters ] we show such a cluster and point out to the area filling dark regions which represent such unwanted events .",
    "the other extreme , when the particles stick out of the cluster , leads to sensitivity to variations in the field going _ away _ from the cluster .",
    "especially if a bump is grown on a tip of a branch , where the field decreases rapidly as one goes away from the tip ( such that @xmath82 increases significantly ) , then the map of the bump gets magnified , resulting in particles of very unequal sizes .",
    "it is necessary to stress that even for @xmath83 , when this procedure appears to yield nice ramified structures , the problem of fill - ups does not go away : in a few rare cases the particle  if it happens to land on a place where @xmath85 is large  is significantly distorted .",
    "the net effect is that large areas surrounded by the cluster ( where the growth probability is small ) are filled up entirely by one distorted particle . for the value of @xmath84 it appeared that the errors may be unbounded .",
    "our numerics indicates that for @xmath83 the errors were bounded for the cluster sizes that we considered .",
    "we do not have a mathematical proof of boundedness of the errors , and our disregard of this danger is only based on the sensible appearance of our clusters at this value of @xmath60 .",
    "in this section we discuss the laurent expansion of our conformal maps , and introduce the statistical objects that are studied numerically in the next section .",
    "since the functions @xmath7 and @xmath86 are required to be linear in @xmath8 at infinity , they can be expanded in a laurent series in which the highest power is @xmath8 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 the recursion equations for the laurent coefficients of @xmath7 can be obtained by substituting the series of @xmath89 and @xmath2 into the recursion formula ( [ eq - recursion ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath90 we note that the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath91 follows from the dependence on the randomly chosen @xmath68 at the @xmath1th step , from which follows the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath1 .",
    "the latter is however a function of all the previous growth steps , making the iteration ( [ eq - f1-recursion ] ) -([eq - coeff - recursion ] ) rather difficult to analyze .",
    "a general relation between the laurent coefficients is furnished by the so - called area theorem which applies to univalent mappings . since our maps",
    "solve the laplace equations with boundary conditions only at infinity and on the cluster boundary where the potential is zero , they map the @xmath8 plane uniquely ( and with a unique inverse ) to the @xmath9 plane . in other words ,",
    "the pressure lines and the stream lines are non - degenerate .",
    "such mappings have the property @xcite that the area of the image of the unit disc in the @xmath1th step is given by : @xmath92 a second theorem that will be useful in our thinking is a consequence of the so - called one - fourth theorem , see appendix a. there a statement is proven that the interior of the curve @xmath93 is contained in the @xmath9-plane by a circle of radius @xmath94 .",
    "now as the area @xmath95 is obtained simply from the superposition of @xmath1 bumps of roughly the same area @xmath96 , it has to scale like @xmath97 , for large @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand any typical radius of the cluster should scale like @xmath98 where @xmath6 is the dimension of the cluster .",
    "we can thus expect a scaling of @xmath99 that goes like @xmath100 we note in passing that this scaling law offers us a very convenient way to measure the fractal dimension of the growing cluster .",
    "indeed , we measured the dimension d for a range of @xmath60 in this way by averaging @xmath99 over 100 clusters .",
    "we found that for a range of @xmath60 spanning the interval @xmath101 $ ] the dimension is constant , around 1.7 .",
    "we can infer from eq.([eq - scalingrad ] ) that the sum in eq .",
    "( [ area ] ) which subtracts positive contributions from @xmath102 contains terms that cancel the behavior of @xmath103 ( remember that @xmath104 ) , leaving a power of unity for the scaling of @xmath95 . indeed , we will show below both numerical and theoretical evidence for the scaling behavior of the @xmath105 for @xmath106 which is in agreement with @xmath103",
    ".    we can give a direct physical interpretation for the coefficients @xmath107 by comparing them to the coefficients of the series for @xmath108 , cf .",
    "eq.([eq - potential ] ) : @xmath109 the coefficient of @xmath110 is unity so that the electric flux is unity .",
    "this corresponds to the normalization of the probability .",
    "the constant @xmath111 is the laplace radius which is the radius of a charged disk which would give the same field far away .",
    "the rest of the @xmath112 s are conventional multipole moments .",
    "the relations between the laurent coefficients of @xmath108 and @xmath0 are : @xmath113    the first line shows that @xmath114 , the laplace radius , in accordance with the one - fourth theorem .",
    "the second line shows that the dipole moment @xmath115 is @xmath116 .",
    "we can interpret this coefficient as a distance , the wandering of the center of charge due to the random addition of the particles .",
    "we will take the point of view that this quantity is less `` intrinsic '' than the others to the dynamics of the dla growth .",
    "in fact , if we set @xmath117 , ( we could imagine shifting the cluster as we grow it ) we can rewrite the rest of the equations : @xmath118 etc .",
    "this leads to the interpretation of @xmath119 in terms of the multipole expansion of the electric field .",
    "our growth process is stochastic .",
    "accordingly , it is natural to introduce averages over the randomness . in our thinking",
    "there are two important averages , one over histories of the whole random trajectory @xmath120 , and the other only over the random choice of @xmath68 at the @xmath1th step . to distinguish between the two we denote the first by angular brackets and refer to it as `` history - average '' , while the second is denoted by an overbar and referred to as a `` cluster - average '' .",
    "there is a possibility that for very large clusters ( @xmath5 ) the two averages result in the same numbers .",
    "we will refer to such a property as `` self - averaging '' .    the cluster average of moments of @xmath64 offers a relationship to the generalized dimensions of the harmonic measure @xcite .",
    "the latter are defined by dividing the plane into boxes of size @xmath121 , and estimating the probability for a random walker to hit the piece of the boundary of the cluster which is included in the @xmath122th box by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the modulus of the electric field @xmath125 at some point in the @xmath122th box",

    "the sums of powers are not cluster independent .",
    "a clear demonstration of this is a simulation that we performed in which the initial condition was very far from a circle .",
    "the individual sums in eq .",
    "( [ eq - expand ] ) were very different from the average values , but nevertheless @xmath208 converged to the right value .",
    "it is our conclusion that each of the sums in ( [ eq - expand ] ) is not cluster independent , and yet somehow the resummed form is cluster independent .",
    "this remarkable sharpening calls for further discussion ; it appears that its interpretation requires better understanding of the time correlations of the field : an independent choice of random realization of a series of @xmath205 according to their multi - fractal distribution can only generate @xmath99 with the proper scaling exponent but can not trivially yield a highly peaked distribution of @xmath99 .",
    "therefore we consider now some evidence for the existence of temporal correlations .",
    "the first outstanding evidence appears in the context of the scaling behavior of @xmath152 , which was discussed in the first subsection .",
    "we show that if we assume that there exist no correlations between different growth stages , the exponent @xmath159 will be very different from the measured and calculated value .",
    "> from the recursion relations of the laurent coefficients ( eq .  [ eq - coeff - recursion ] ) we can estimate , in the limit of large @xmath1 when @xmath64 is very small on the average , @xmath209 the second line is obtained because @xmath210 is proportional to the radius of the whole cluster and should not be correlated with @xmath211 .",
    "the crucial approximation comes next : if @xmath211 and @xmath212 can be treated as independent for @xmath213 , then ( since @xmath214 and @xmath215 are independent ) eq.([eq - f0 ] ) simplifies to @xmath216 the numerical simulation resulted in an exponent of the order of 0.7 , in serious disagreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq - diag ] ) .",
    "we think that the assumption of independence , eq .",
    "( [ eq - onlydiag ] ) is the culprit .",
    "another fact which illustrates the importance of the time - angle correlation eq .",
    "( [ eq - onlydiag ] ) is the difference between the exponents of @xmath152 and @xmath217 ( @xmath218 whereas @xmath219 ) differ , for small @xmath64 , by two terms only .",
    "the first one is the term @xmath220 in the rhs of the equation for @xmath217 which is absent in the equation for @xmath152 .",
    "we checked numerically that neglecting this term leads to a very small change in the exponent .",
    "the second difference between is that the term @xmath221 in eq.([eq - f0 ] ) is replaced by @xmath222 .",
    "the change in the exponent can therefore be directly attributed to the existence of important time - angle correlations .",
    "we tried to analyze numerically the time - angle correlations @xmath223 .",
    "the results for some @xmath165 s are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - anglecorr ] .",
    "it appears that as we increase the size of the ensemble , @xmath224 with the usual @xmath225 dependence on the ensemble size .",
    "if we believe these numerical results ( doubts may exist due to the relative smallness of the ensembles analyzed ) , then the previous results must be related to more subtle correlation of higher order nature .",
    "lastly we would like to discuss the importance of early stages of the growth .",
    "@xmath226 might be written in the following way @xmath227 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq - f1-recursion ] ) ) . neglecting the correlations in time in the above product",
    "one may approximate @xmath228 numerical evaluation of the two objects in eq.([approx ] ) shows that they differ by a few percent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - differ ] ) .",
    "the numerics indicate the scaling laws @xmath229 where @xmath230 .    to get further intuition we checked also the object @xmath231 for various values of @xmath165 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - differ ] .",
    "as it seems from this graph , time correlations between the initial and late stages of the growth are much more important than local correlations in the late stages .",
    "we checked also two - point time correlations @xmath232 for some @xmath165 s .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - corr ] .",
    "as it turns out from this graph , @xmath233 up to statistical fluctuations .",
    "the language proposed by hastings and levitov appears to offer many appealing features .",
    "it generates dla clusters in such a way that the conformal map @xmath0 from the circle to the boundary of the cluster is known at every instant . in this paper we examined carefully the numerical procedure used to generate the conformal maps , and pointed out the advantages and the shortcoming of the algorithm .",
    "the new results of this paper pertain to the scaling behavior of the laurent coefficients @xmath234 of the conformal map @xmath0 and of the moments of @xmath64 which are related to moments of the field .",
    "we presented a theoretical discussion of the exponents characterizing moments of @xmath234 and @xmath64 .",
    "we pointed out the relations to the multfifractal analysis of the harmonic measure , and derived scaling relations .",
    "of particular interest is the scaling relation @xmath190 that was derived first by halsey and which appears here as a very natural consequence of the formalism .",
    "one important result which is not adequately interpreted in this paper is the sharpness of the distribution of @xmath137 .",
    "this coefficient is proportional to the radius of the cluster , and its sharpness is directly related to the existence of a universal fractal dimension independently of the details of the shape of the cluster . understanding the sharpness appears to be connected to understanding the existence of universal fractal dimension , and we believe that it poses a very worthwhile and focussed question for the immediate future .",

    "in this appendix we prove that every univalent function of the type ( [ eq - laurent - f ] ) is bounded in a circle of radius @xmath235 .",
    "this fact is based on two basic properties of univalent functions",

    "4 we are interested in @xmath255 : @xmath256 } |e(s)|    ( or equivalently , of @xmath257 ) , an examination of eq ( [ estim ] ) shows that for large @xmath165 the fluctuations in the values of the integrands depend more crucially on the phase variations than on the field and radius variations .",
    "the phase varies appreciably when @xmath52 changes an amount @xmath258 and therefore it is useful to split up the integral eq.([a1 ] ) into a sum of essentially independent contributions coming from the electric field singularities with exponents @xmath168 .",
    "this exponent is determined by the scaling law relating the measure ( which is proportional to @xmath259 ) of a box to its size @xmath260 : @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "the integral is split into contributions made of contour sections of different lengths @xmath262 dependent on the singularity but each giving rise to the same change @xmath259 .",
    "if one can estimate both the magnitude of the contribution of a specific multifractal electric field singularity @xmath168 to the integral and the number of such contributions @xmath263 @xcite , then one can write @xmath264 where @xmath265 to estimate @xmath266 we recall that by definition @xmath267 > from eq.([a3 ] ) @xmath268 using eq.([a6 ] ) and the fact that the fractal dimension of singularities of size @xmath168 is @xmath269 , we can now also estimate the number of singularities of size @xmath168 which contribute to the integral as @xmath270 to estimate @xmath271 we note that the major contribution to eq .",
    "( [ ialph ] ) comes from the support of the harmonic measure where @xmath272 .",
    "accordingly @xmath273 where we have made use of eqs.([a2 ] ) , ( [ a3 ] ) . combining eq.([a4 ] ) with the estimates ( [ a7 ] ) and ( [ a9 ] ) then yields @xmath274 we note that the approximation adopted in this appendix differs from the delta - function assumption ( [ delfunc ] ) in asserting that for high values of @xmath165 the variation of the phase dominates the decay of the integrand compared to the rapid decorrelation of the field .",
    "one would guess that for @xmath165 of the order of unity the field decorrelates faster due to the rapid variation over the arc length . for high values of @xmath165",
