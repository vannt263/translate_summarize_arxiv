    "unlike the equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , which are well developed after the pioneering works of boltzmann and gibbs , our understanding of non - equilibrium thermodynamics is restricted to some special models and cases .",

    "these models exhibit a variety of phase transition arising from a diffusive ( collisional ) relaxation .",
    "for some of these models local equilibrium and hydrodynamic equations have been derived rigorously  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , other physical systems for which the approach to final stationary state is through a process of collisionless relaxation  @xcite . gravitational systems and",
    "confined one component plasmas are just two such examples . for these systems",
    "the collision duration time diverges and the relaxation is governed by the collisionless boltzmann ( vlasov ) equation  @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit , the collisionless relaxation process leads to non - maxwell - boltzmann velocity distributions , even for stationary states without macroscopic currents . unlike normal thermodynamic equilibrium , the stationary state which follows",
    "the collisionless relaxation depends explicitly on the initial distribution of particle positions and velocities . in spite of this complication",
    ", it was recently shown that it is possible to construct a statistical theory that quantitatively describes these states  @xcite .",
    "beams of electrons driven by accelerating vacuum devices , like the thermionic valves , diodes , and magnetrons , also do not relax to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution  @xcite . unlike the driven stochastic lattice gases , these systems , however , are intrinsically collisionless . an important practical question concerns the kinetic temperature distribution in thermionic devices in which the directed velocity produced by the electric field is comparable to the thermal velocity  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly the case for the transitional region between child - langmuir and no - cutoff regimes in magnetrons , where the electric potential becomes comparable to the thermal energy  @xcite . even when the final directed velocity is larger than the thermal velocity , there is a region near the emitting cathode where thermal effects are important .",
    "it is of great practical interest to determine the extent of these regions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since in these systems the collision duration time diverges , there is no local equilibrium , and one can not _ a priori _ postulate an equation of state relating the beam density and the beam temperature , as for adiabatic or isothermal processes",
    ". instead , given the properties of thermionic filaments  such as say the velocity distribution of the emitted electrons  one should solve the boundary value problem posed by the vlasov equation .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to develop a theoretical framework which will allow us to study the relaxation dynamics and the stationary states of collisionless driven systems .    as a prototype of a collisionless driven system",
    ", we consider a beam of electrons , accelerated by an external electric field , traveling from an emitting ( planar ) cathode to a collecting ( planar ) anode across the device gap .",
    "the cathode , located at position @xmath0 , is kept at electrostatic potential @xmath1 and is heated to temperature @xmath2 , resulting in the emission of electrons . after traversing the device gap ,",
    "these electrons are collected at the cold anode ( @xmath3 ) located at @xmath4 and kept at potential @xmath5 . during the steady state operation ,",
    "the region between the cathode and anode contains a total of @xmath6 electrons , resulting in a current density @xmath7 .",

    "can be taken to be uniform .",
    "furthermore , the one particle distribution function for a collisionless system in a steady state must satisfy the stationary vlasov equation , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the elementary charge , @xmath13 is the electron mass , and @xmath14 is the static distribution function . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "vlasov equation becomes exact for particles interacting by long range potentials  @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath28 can only be obtained once the full problem has been resolved .",
    "the distribution function over the length of the whole diode is then        integrating the distribution function @xmath31 $ ] over the possible values of velocity , we arrive at a nonlinear integro - differential equation for the electrostatic potential , @xmath32 it is important to note the difference between this equation and the poisson - boltzmann equation obtained for usual collisional plasmas and electrolytes in the mean - field limit  @xcite . equation ( [ equa4 ] ) can be solved numerically , to yield the electrostatic potential and the distribution function for the electron beam in the stationary state .    for systems with long range interactions ,",
    "vlasov equation should become exact in the thermodynamic limit . to confirm this for our system",
    ", we have performed molecular dynamics simulation of an equivalent one dimensional model .",
    "the simulated system consists of @xmath33 mutually interacting charged sheets of area @xmath25  each containing @xmath34 electrons of the same velocity  moving along the @xmath10 axis , under the action of the external electric field produced by the grounded cathode @xmath35 and an anode kept at a fixed potential @xmath36 .",
    "the interaction potential between the two sheets @xmath37 is the green s function  @xcite of the laplace equation , @xmath38 with the boundary conditions @xmath39 . solving this equation",
    "we obtain @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the smaller and the larger of the two particle coordinates @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the sheet dynamics is then @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the charge and mass of each sheet respectively .",

    "when the acceleration vanishes , the associated current is denoted as the _ limiting _ one .",
    "since we wish to describe a hot cathode and a cycling current inside the device , we adopt the following strategy .",
    "we advance the simulation in small time steps , always obeying eq .",

    "it is re - injected at the cathode position . at this point",
    "all the particles in a small region @xmath57 around the cathode are re - thermalized , so as to ensure that the distribution there keeps its original form of a truncated maxwellian .",
    "the width @xmath57 must be sufficiently small , @xmath58 , but apart from this condition its precise value is arbitrary .",
    "the simulations were performed with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in all cases",
    "we start with a uniform distribution of sheets and compute the observables only after the system reaches its final stationary state .",
    "to compare the predictions of the theory with the results of the simulations , we consider the density and the temperature distributions inside the diode .",
    "the kinetic temperature is defined as @xmath61 where the over - bar denotes the velocity average at a given position @xmath10 .",

    "it is convenient to scale space and time with the diode length @xmath9 and the plasma frequency @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "dimensionless coordinate and velocity can then be defined as @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , eqs .",
    "( [ equa5 ] ) and ( [ equa3 ] ) show that adimensional voltage and adimensional temperature can be defined as @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , and serve as the control parameters for the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1.eps](a ) the scaled temperature @xmath68 is plotted against the scaled coordinate @xmath69 .",
    "we consider @xmath70 and also consider a device operating at its limiting current , @xmath71 .",
    "a striking feature of this plot is that the temperature drops rapidly as one moves away from cathode towards anode .",
    "we next study the dependence of scaled density @xmath72 along the length of the diode .",
    "the density is very high near the cathode , where the average velocity is small .",

    "[ fig1.eps](b ) .",
    "agreement between the simulations and the theory for both the kinetic temperature and density is excellent .",
    "we now study the current - voltage phase diagram of the device .",
    "in general , current is a function of the voltage drop , the temperature , the gap length , and the total charge of the device .",
    "however , by measuring the time in units of one over the plasma frequency @xmath73 , and the length in units of the gap length @xmath9 , we can scale away two of these variables . the current density can be calculated using @xmath74 since in the steady state the current does not depend on either time or coordinate , integration along the @xmath10 axis and over the cross sectional area @xmath25 yields @xmath75 furthermore , since the current density is measured in units @xmath76 \\sim [ ne v / a l]$ ] , rescaling it in terms of the gap length and the plasma frequency , we can write the reduced current density as @xmath77 , which then satisfies @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the reduced velocity averaged over _ all _ the particles . the reduced average velocity , in turn , must be a function of the two previously introduced control parameters : the reduced voltage and temperature .",

    "[ fig2.eps ] we plot @xmath80 vs. @xmath81 for various @xmath68 .",
    "the phase diagram provides all the information about the current - voltage characteristics for all possible planar diodes .",
    "the first feature to note is that all the different curves emanate from the limiting current backbone , which traces a temperature dependent path in the @xmath82 plane . to the left of the limiting current border , indicated by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2.eps ] , the distribution function can no longer be described by a unidirectional maxwellian , such as the expression ( [ equa3 ] ) .",
    "the transition resembles bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) . in the case of bec",
    " below the critical temperature  a macroscopically populated ground state appears , and only a fraction of particles remains in the excited states .",
    "similarly , in the case of our diode , to the left of the limiting curve , part of the charge must be expelled from the system before a stationary state can be achieved .",
    "as @xmath83 , the voltage effects become negligible compared to the thermal ones , and the beam density becomes uniform across the gap . in this limit ,",
    "it is possible to show that the dimensionless backbone curve asymptotes to a vertical line , @xmath84 , fig .",

    "differently from the lattice gases whose dynamics is diffusive , the distribution function of collisionless systems satisfies the vlasov equation . for the class of driven systems introduced in this letter",

    ", therefore , be relevant to the design and operation of real electronic devises .",
    "it is important to stress that in the absence of collisions , a charged beam does not relax to an equilibrium with a known equation of state .",
    "in fact , the thermodynamic temperature is defined only in the vicinity of the hot emitting cathode .",
    "away from the cathode , dynamics is controlled by the collisionless vlasov equation , which has to be solved as a boundary value problem .",
    "once the solution is obtained , all the macroscopic quantities can be determined via appropriate averages .",
