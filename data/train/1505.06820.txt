    "quantum discord ( qd ) has received much attention , since it was proposed by ollivier and zurek @xcite .",
    "the quantum discord which measures a more generic kind of quantum correlation , is known to have nonzero values even for separable mixed states @xcite .",
    "qd is made on the fact that two classical equivalent ways of defining the mutual information are not equivalent in the quantum domain . in general , it is to some extent hard to calculate qd and analytical solutions can hardly be found except for some certain cases , such as the so - called x states @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of finding analytical solutions for qd led dakic et al . to introduce a geometric measure of qd @xcite , which determines the amount of quantum correlations of a state in terms of its minimal hilbert - schmidt distance from the set of classical states .",
    "the calculation of this measure needs an easier minimization process , which is obtainable analytically for general two - qubit states @xcite as well as for arbitrary bipartite states @xcite . such a distance is well - known not to contractive under trace - preserving quantum channels @xcite",
    "this naturally leads to a redefinition of the geometric discord in terms of a metric that fulfills the contractivity property .",
    "one such metric is the trace distance @xcite , which uses the schatten one - norm ( or trace norm ) . in this paper",
    ", we refer to this particular geometric measure as trace distance discord ( tdd ) .",
    "+ in last years , with the development of quantum information and quantum computation , spin systems have an extensive application in the field of quantum information @xcite .",
    "heisenberg model , as the simplest spin chain , has been researched in many fields of quantum information and computation .",
    "it can be implemented in many physical systems such as quantum dot system @xcite , nucleus system @xcite , electronic spin system @xcite and optical lattices system @xcite and so on .",
    "quantum correlation in the heisenberg model is like a bridge between quantum information and condensed matter physics . + motivated by real materials like @xmath0 known as azurite , which is an exciting quantum anti - ferromagnetic model characterized by heisenberg model on generalized diamond chain .",
    "honecker et al . investigated the dynamic and thermodynamic properties for this model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the thermodynamics of the ising - heisenberg model on diamond - like chain was also vastly discussed ( see @xcite ) . the motivation to research the ising - xyz diamond chain model",
    "is based in some recent works . lately",
    ", the properties of thermal entanglement have been studied in the ising - xxz model on diamond chain @xcite , and in the ising - xyz model on diamond chain @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite necessary to study the qd of the ising - xyz on diamond chain .",
    "also , only a few studies are directed to the relation between qd and tdd in the quantum channels @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we also compare the qd and tdd and illustrate their different characteristics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we present the ising - xyz model on diamond chain . further , in sec .",
    "3 we review the definition of qd and tdd . in sec .",
    "4 we have discussed qd and tdd of heisenberg reduced density operator of the model . finally , concluding remarks are given in sec.5 .",
    "[ [ qd ] ] qd ~~    in classical information theory , the total correlation between two arbitrary parts can be expressed as two kinds of equivalent expressions of mutual information . in the quantum domain ,",
    "one of quantum extension of mutual information is equal to total correlation .",
    "it can be expressed as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is von neumann entropy and @xmath3 is the reduced density operator of the part @xmath4 .",
    "the other quantum version of mutual information can be written after a complete set of projection measurements @xmath5 .",
    "since the systems have quantum correlation , the quantum correlation will unavoidably cause to another system disturbed when we measure one quantum system .",
    "therefore , the two quantum extensions of mutual information are not equal to each other .",
    "however the maximum of the second extension can be interpreted as a measure of classical correlations @xmath6 .",
    "it can be written as @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the conditional entropy of partition @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the minimum value in eq . ( 2 ) is due to the complete set of projection measurements @xmath5 .",
    "the minimum difference between the two quantum versions of mutual information is equal to qd .",
    "it can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath12      at first , we briefly review the definition and the general formalism for the trace distance discord . for any bipartite system @xmath13 which described by the density operator @xmath14",

    "we will now discuss them with the corresponding plots .",
    "the qd and tdd both are known to vary with the parameters @xmath69 , @xmath36 , @xmath35 , @xmath70 and t. by fixing some of the parameters we can analyze the roles that the others play in qd and tdd . + in fig .",

    "we can see from fig .",
    "2 , both qd and tdd increase from zero to some peak values in the beginning and then decrease with temperature increasing . note that the peak value depend on @xmath71 , so that smaller @xmath71 have higher peak values .",
    "moreover , after reaching to peak values qd and tdd decrease more slowly for larger value of @xmath71 , as temperature goes up , than smaller value of @xmath71 .",
    "the distinct difference between qd and tdd is : tdd has larger value than tdd .",
    "that the qd and tdd do not monotonically decline with increasing temperature shows the more correlated low - lying excited states in some regions @xcite .",
    "in addition , pairwise thermal entanglement of ising - xyz diamond chain model has been considered in ref .",
    "the authors found that thermal entanglement vanishes as for as the temperature increases , while we find from fig .",
    "2 that , qd and tdd do not vanish up to infinite temperature .",
    "it indicates that , both of the qd and tdd are more general quantum correlations than entanglement .",
    "+ we now turn to characterize the dependence of qd and tdd on magnetic field . fig .",
    "3 shows the behavior of qd and tdd versus magnetic field and different temperature at a fixed value of @xmath61 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 . for the qd case ,",
    "as the temperature is low ( @xmath63 ) there are three sharp peaks ( fig .",
    "as we increase temperature , the middle peak gets shorter .",
    "compared with qd , we can see from fig .",
    "3(b ) the behavior of tdd is different from qd to some extent . as the temperature is low ( @xmath63 )",
    ", we can see obviously only one peak .",
    "as we increase temperature ( @xmath64 ) , one can see that the one peak evolve into three peaks .",
    "that is to say , the left and right peaks appear .",
    "when @xmath65 the middle peak get shorter .",
    "as the temperature is further increased , for example @xmath66 , the middle peak disappears and we can see two sharp peaks . also , qd and tdd finally vanish as magnetic field increases , namely strong magnetic field is harmful to quantum correlation . in fig .",
    "4 the behaviors of two quantities versus magnetic field at two certain temperature ( @xmath78 fig .",
    "4(a ) and @xmath79 fig .",
    "4(b ) ) are compared .",
    "we can known that the two quantities are not symmetric with respect to the zero magnetic field , moreover the qd has always lower value than tdd at the temperature both @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "+ we now move to investigate how the quantum correlations behaves as we change the anisotropy parameter at finite temperature . the qd and tdd as a function of @xmath35 and @xmath54 for fixed values of @xmath80 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that qd and tdd are not a symmetric function about zero anisotropy parameter @xmath35",
    ". we can see that qd and tdd evolve similar but not the same which can be seen clearly from fig .",
    "5 . as increasing absolute value of anisotropy parameter @xmath35 , quantum correlations decreases to a minimum value first and then increase to maximum value .",
    "furthermore , the value of qd and tdd are nearly a constant when @xmath35 is large enough as shown in fig .",
    "the constant is not the same for different temperature .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the quantum correlations ( quantum discord and trace distance discord ) of the spin-@xmath81 ising - xyz chain on diamond structure . by changing the magnetic field , anisotropy parameter ,",
    "coupling constant and also temperature we observed that the overall behavior of qd and tdd is alike to a large extent .",
    "we found that , the anisotropy parameter can both decrease and increase quantum correlation .",
    "moreover , we observed regimes where qd and tdd increase by increasing temperature @xmath47 , while concurrence decreases with @xmath47 . finally , we observed strong magnetic field suppresses quantum correlations , while weak magnetic field can increase or decrease qd and tdd . by comparison between qd and tdd",
    "versus magnetic field we showed that tdd is always greater than qd .",
