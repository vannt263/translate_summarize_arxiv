    "<S> stimulated by the new evidence of @xmath0 observed in the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum , we first propose the charmonium - like state @xmath0 as the s - wave @xmath2 molecular state with @xmath3 , which is supported well by dynamics study of the system composed of the pseudoscalar and scalar charmed mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the s - wave @xmath4 molecular charmonium appears as the molecular partner of @xmath0 , which is in accord with the enhancement structure appearing at 4.2 gev in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum from @xmath6 decays . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that the enhancement structures , @xmath7 , the newly observed @xmath0 and the previously announced @xmath8 in the @xmath1 and @xmath5 invariant mass spectra , can be understood well under the uniform framework of the molecular charmonium , which can be tested by future experiments .    very recently the cdf collaboration @xcite studied the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum in the @xmath10 channel based on the sample of @xmath11 collision data with an integrated luminosity of 6 fb@xmath12 . besides confirming the previous @xmath13 state @xcite , cdf also reported the observation of an explicit enhancement structure with @xmath14 significance in the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum , which is of mass @xmath15 mev and width @xmath16 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to this new structure by the name @xmath0 in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of @xmath0 in the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum not only makes the charmonium - like family abundant , but also raises our interest in exploring the origin of enhancement structures in the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum and revealing the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath13 , which will be helpful to improve our knowledge of the underlying properties of charmonium - like state .    </S>",
    "<S> c    the previous observation of @xmath13 has stimulated great interest among theorists , especially when associating it with @xmath17 reported by the belle collaboration @xcite and confirmed by the babar collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath13 and @xmath17 were observed in the mass spectrum of @xmath18 in @xmath6 meson decay @xmath19 generally in the weak decays of @xmath6 meson , the @xmath20 pair creation mainly results from the color - octet mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a color - octet @xmath21 pair is easily popped out by a gluon . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath22 and @xmath23 capture @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively to form a pair of charmed mesons . by this mechanism , </S>",
    "<S> a pair of the charm - strange mesons with the low momentum easily interact with each other and even form the molecular charmonium </S>",
    "<S> . additionally , @xmath13 and @xmath17 are close to the thresholds of @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , and satisfy an almost exact mass relation @xmath28 the mass difference between @xmath13 and @xmath17 is approximately equal to that between @xmath29 and @xmath30 mesons : @xmath31 the peculiarity of @xmath32 and the similarity between @xmath13 and @xmath17 provoke an uniform molecular charmonium picture to reveal the underlying structure of @xmath13 and @xmath17 @xcite . applying @xmath26 and @xmath27 molecular structures to explain @xmath13 and @xmath17 respectively not only solves a long - standing puzzle of the structure of @xmath17 , but also opens a window to investigate the hadron dynamics of exotic state beyond the conventional @xmath21 and @xmath33 states . </S>",
    "<S> a series of research work related with @xmath13 were carried out later @xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bw ] , we present the comparison between the experimental data @xcite and the thresholds of the charmed - strange meson pairs . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is just below the threshold of @xmath34 similar to the situation of @xmath13 , which stimulates us to deduce naturally that @xmath0 enhancement results from an s - wave @xmath35 molecular system @xmath36 with the flavor wave function @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath38 parity of the isoscalar @xmath0 is positive due to the @xmath39 decay mode observed by cdf . </S>",

    "<S> performing dynamical investigations of @xmath36 and @xmath40 can answer whether there exist @xmath36 and @xmath40 molecular systems , which is one of the main tasks of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> what is more important is that understanding the underlying structure of @xmath0 will be helpful for revealing the properties of @xmath13 @xcite taking into account the similarities between @xmath0 and @xmath13 .    using the effective lagrangian in the heavy meson chiral perturbation theory ( hm@xmath43pt ) @xcite and the method developed in literature @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the effective potentials of @xmath36 and @xmath40 states @xcite @xmath44 here , the subscript of the sub - potential denotes the exchanged light meson . </S>",
    "<S> the general expressions of the sub - potentials corresponding to the pseudoscalar , sigma and vector meson exchanges are @xmath45 where @xmath46 mev and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are the parameters in the effective lagrangian , which describe the interaction of the heavy flavor mesons with the light mesons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 is taken as @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath36 and @xmath40 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> and the @xmath55 function is @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 is the cutoff to cure the singularity of the effective potential .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ potential ] , one presents the line shapes of the potentials listed in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ qq ] ) . for @xmath36 , the exchange potential of the @xmath29 meson can be ignored compared with that of the @xmath61 meson . </S>",
    "<S> the total effective potential of @xmath36 is dominated by the @xmath61 exchange potential . for @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath62 meson plays an important role especially in the range of @xmath63 gev@xmath12 since the exchange potentials of @xmath64 , @xmath30 , @xmath65 and @xmath61 decay exponentially with @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the potential depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ potential ] indicates that we only need to consider the @xmath61 meson exchange potential for @xmath36 and the @xmath62 meson exchange potential for @xmath40 when finding the bound state solution by solving schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , whether there exist bound state solutions for @xmath36 and @xmath40 systems is closely related to the corresponding strengths of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> cc    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ess ] , we show the variation of the numerical result of the bound state solutions for @xmath36 with the values of @xmath49 and @xmath60 , which indicates that there indeed exists a @xmath69 molecular charmonium corresponding to newly observed enhancement @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> . our numerical results overlap with the mass difference ( @xmath70 mev ) between @xmath0 and the threshold of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding cutoff @xmath60 lies in a reasonable range which is expected to be around 1 - 3 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the larger @xmath72 values make the corresponding @xmath60 become smaller , @xmath7 , @xmath60 tends to be around @xmath73 gev , which is fully consistent with the expected behavior of the potential of the s - wave @xmath69 system .    besides supporting the assignment of @xmath0 as the s - wave @xmath69 molecular state , our dynamical calculation also provides a novel approach to extract the @xmath49 parameter , which encodes the important information of the @xmath67 interaction and the underlying properties of @xmath74 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling can not be extracted experimentally since the @xmath75 decay is forbidden kinematically . </S>",
    "<S> our result indicates that the @xmath72 value corresponding to the binding energy of the s - wave @xmath69 system consistent with mass difference ( @xmath70 mev ) is in the range @xmath76 associated with reasonable @xmath60 value , which can be confirmed by further theoretical study .    </S>",
    "<S> cc    we extend the same formalism to the @xmath40 system , where input parameter @xmath49 for the @xmath77 coupling is constrained by the decay width of the @xmath78 to be @xmath79 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy of the @xmath40 system is @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 mev corresponding to the typical value of @xmath87 gev , where the bound state solution of the @xmath40 system is insensitive to @xmath60 , which indicates the existence of the molecular cousin of the s - wave @xmath69 molecular state , @xmath7 , an s - wave @xmath88 molecular charmonium . </S>",
    "<S> thus , finding the evidence of s - wave @xmath88 molecular charmonium can provide important support to the assignment of @xmath0 as an s - wave @xmath69 molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> the important hidden - charm decay mode of the s - wave @xmath88 molecular charmonium is @xmath5 , which is the same as in the case of @xmath17 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> cc    from the published experimental data of the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum @xcite , we indeed notice an enhancement structure around 4.2 gev just below the threshold of the @xmath89 pair as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 4202 ] , which is amazingly consistent with our prediction of the s - wave @xmath88 molecular charmonium . </S>",
    "<S> we expect further high - statistics measurement from future experiments to test our prediction of the s - wave @xmath88 molecular charmonium .    the s - wave @xmath90 molecular state with spin - parity @xmath3 does not couple to the @xmath91 channels , which is strictly forbidden by the conservation of the parity and angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the s - wave @xmath90 molecular state may couple to the @xmath92 and @xmath93 via p - wave , which is expected to be suppressed compared to the s - wave mode . due to the above reasons , the coupled - channel effect on the s - wave @xmath90 molecular state may be weak , which is ignored in this work .    as an s - wave @xmath69 molecular charmonium with @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the decay modes of @xmath0 include the hidden - charm decay mode @xmath1 observed by cdf @xcite , the two - body p - wave open - charm decays @xmath94 and @xmath26 , the radiative decay @xmath95 , and the iso - spin violating three - body strong decay @xmath96 via the @xmath97 mixing mechanism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly @xmath40 can decay into @xmath5 , @xmath98 , @xmath27 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 etc .    after figuring out the underlying structure of @xmath0 and predicting its molecular cousin </S>",
    "<S> , we notice that there exist two event clusters around the ranges of @xmath101 gev and @xmath102 gev marked by yellow and pink in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bw ] , if we focus on the remaining cdf s data corresponding to @xmath103 gev . </S>",
    "<S> if these two event clusters are confirmed by future experiments , we might also try to understand them under the same framework of the molecular charmonium . basing on the present low - statistic data @xcite , we speculate that the structure appearing at @xmath101 is related to the @xmath104 or @xmath105 system . </S>",
    "<S> the other one in the range @xmath102 gev may result from the @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 systems since the event cluster in the range @xmath102 gev just overlaps with the corresponding thresholds ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bw ] for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> one may recall the similar situation before finding the evidence of @xmath0 by cdf @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cdf s data with an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb@xmath12 reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite only displayed the event cluster at 4.27 gev besides the evidence of @xmath13 . confirming the above speculation by further experimental study of @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum from @xmath6 decay will not only test the molecular charmonium assignments of @xmath13 and @xmath0 , but also improve our understanding of the line shapes appearing at hidden - charm invariant mass spectra .    in summary , the newly observed structure @xmath0 in the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum </S>",
    "<S> is first interpreted as the s - wave @xmath2 molecular charmonium well from the dynamical study of the system composed of the pseudoscalar and scalar charmed mesons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we predict the s - wave @xmath4 molecular charmonium appearing as the cousin of @xmath0 , which is consistent with the enhancement structure around 4.2 gev in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum from @xmath6 decay @xcite . thus , the enhancement structures including the present @xmath0 , the previous @xmath13 and @xmath17 observed in the @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite invariant mass spectra respectively , can be accommodated well in the uniform framework of the molecular charmonium . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find two possible event clusters in the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum might related to the molecular charmonia , which can be tested by high - statistic experimental data in future experiment . </S>"
