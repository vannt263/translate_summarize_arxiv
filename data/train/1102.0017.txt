    "one of the most prominent discoveries of the heavy ion program at rhic has been the success of hydrodynamics @xcite with a zero @xcite or very small @xcite viscosity .",
    "though the exact value of the viscosity can not yet be extracted due to uncertainties in the initial state and other effects , it is a robust result that the viscosity near the qcd crossover temperature is small , @xmath3 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "perturbative calculations show that the viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath4 at high temperatures @xmath5 gev , where perturbation theory should work , is significantly higher @xcite .",
    "both theoretical @xcite and data - driven @xcite analyses of the pion gas indicate that @xmath4 also rises at low temperatures , suggesting that the relative viscosity bottoms out near the crossover @xcite , similar to the behavior in conventional fluids @xcite .    the bulk viscosity is also expected to be important in the hydrodynamics of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "bulk viscosity vanishes for a conformal system , a good approximation to qcd at high temperatures ; therefore the bulk viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath6 is small at high temperatures @xcite . near the crossover temperature qcd is very far from conformal , as indicated by the peak in @xmath7 @xcite , and it is expected that @xmath6 may display a peak at this scale @xcite . at lower temperatures qcd is well described by a pion gas .",
    "existing studies of pion gases indicate that the bulk viscosity falls away at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the ratio @xmath6 shows the opposite behavior of @xmath4 , peaking near the transition and falling off to either side @xcite .",
    "however , previous analyses of the bulk viscosity of a pion gas have been very incomplete .",
    "in particular , neither standard reference @xcite considers number changing processes .",
    "but such processes are essential to the relaxation of particle number to equilibrium and frequently control the bulk viscosity , as emphasized by jeon @xcite . therefore we believe that what the calculations in the literature we computing was not really the bulk viscosity of a pion gas , but the constant for a relaxation process which treated kinetic but not chemical equilibration . to make a fair comparison with the calculations of @xmath6 at higher temperatures one should compute the true bulk viscosity of a pion gas at low temperatures .",
    "when the bulk viscosity calculated in this way becomes large , it indicates that the pion gas will lose chemical equilibrium , a physically interesting property .",
    "in this paper we will provide a calculation of the bulk viscosity of a pion gas , including the relaxation via number changing reactions to chemical equilibrium .",
    "we will work to lowest nontrivial order in chiral perturbation theory , the effective theory of low energy pions .",
    "that is , we will make an expansion to lowest order in @xmath8 and @xmath9 , treating @xmath10 as a free parameter of order 1 .",
    "( here @xmath11 is the pion decay constant , @xmath0 is the pion mass treating the @xmath12 and @xmath13 as degenerate , and @xmath14 is the temperature as usual . )",
    "our treatment is therefore only valid at temperature scales low enough that there are almost no resonances ( such as @xmath15 mesons ) and few kaons relative to pions ; we will not try to extrapolate close to the crossover temperature .    in the next section of the paper",
    "we will review the physics of bulk viscosity in a gas of relativistic , massive , weakly coupled bosons , emphasizing the role played by number changing processes .",
    "we show that the bulk viscosity is controlled by @xmath16 and by the rate of number changing processes . in section [ sec : chipt ] we present the calculation of the number changing rate within chiral perturbation theory .",
    "our numerical results and conclusions are presented in section [ sec : discussion ] , but can be summarized here .",
    "we find that , as temperature falls , number changing processes become less efficient and the bulk viscosity actually grows , scaling as @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "therefore the behavior of bulk viscosity is not the opposite of the behavior of shear viscosity , and in particular both the bulk viscosity to entropy ratio and the bulk viscosity itself diverge exponentially in the low temperature limit .",
    "by definition , bulk viscosity @xmath21 is a reduction of the pressure in an expanding system , and increase in pressure in a contracting system , proportional to the rate of volume change , for vectors and normal letters @xmath22 for their magnitudes ; @xmath23 is always the pressure . ] [ def_zeta ] p = p_eq - v = p_eq - .",
    "this arises because the volume change induces a departure from equilibrium , which in turn modifies the pressure . to see how this occurs for a pion gas",
    ", we need to describe the system in terms of a calculable approximation scheme .",
    "since physical qcd is near the chiral limit , the pion is a pseudo - goldstone boson of the ( spontaneously but also explicitly broken ) chiral symmetry , and pions are therefore weakly coupled at low momenta and well described by chiral perturbation theory ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "weak coupling means that thermal pions will have well defined quasiparticles which will be well described by boltzmann equations . defining the species sum and integration",
    "_ a _ a , the pressure is related to the occupancy of species @xmath24 at momentum @xmath25 , @xmath26 , via p = _ a 2 p^2 f_a ( ) .",
    "[ eq : pressure ] @xmath26 in turn evolves according to the boltzmann equation [ eq : boltzmann ] 2e _ + 2 = - c[f ] = - c_elastic[f ] - c_inel[f ] , with @xmath27 $ ] the collision operator , which we discuss in more detail below .",
    "the lefthand side of the boltzmann equation drives the system from equilibrium .",
    "since the bulk viscosity involves one spacetime gradient , we can find it by expanding the boltzmann equation to first order in gradients ; since the lefthand side is explicitly first order in gradients , we may substitute @xmath28 with its equilibrium form f_0 = ( - 1 ) ^-1 .",
    "we take the energy to be @xmath29 , meaning that we will neglect interaction self - energy corrections in comparison to the explicit pion mass .",
    "clearly this treatment does not allow us to consider qcd in the strict chiral symmetry limit , where interaction effects are the only thing which lead to modified dispersion .",
    "it would be interesting to return to this case in the future , but we expect it to be rather subtle ; for instance , the lowest order interaction effect actually does not change the dispersion relation @xcite , and the next order only shifts the speed of propagation away from the speed of light @xcite , which we believe also does not lead to nonvanishing bulk viscosity . therefore interaction effects appear to arise at a rather high order in @xmath30 .",
    "therefore interaction effects can be neglected for @xmath31 , which is what we are considering . in this case , explicitly evaluating the lefthand side of the boltzmann equation yields 2e _ + 2 = 2f_0(1+f_0 ) ( + _",
    "we are interested in the case @xmath32 .",
    "the temperature changes with time because expansion causes cooling ; at first order in gradients the time dependence of the temperature has its usual equilibrium relation to @xmath33 , @xmath34 with @xmath35 the squared speed of sound @xcite .",
    "therefore the lefthand side of the boltzmann equation is 2f_0(1+f_0 ) v. [ eq : source ]    this `` source '' for departure from equilibrium has no net energy content . to see this , note that [ eq : pressure2 ] p = _ a f_0 ( ) , & = & _ a 2e_^2 f_0 ( ) , + [ eq : cs ] c_s^2 = = & = & and therefore [ speed_sound ] _ a e f_0(1+f_0 ) = c_s^2 _ a e f_0(1+f_0 ) , which shows that there is no energy content for the `` source '' for departure from equilibrium . that this occurs is just a check that we have correctly identified the time dependence of the temperature",
    "however , the `` source '' _ does _ carry a net particle number , namely .",
    "|_lhs = _ a f_0(1+f_0 ) 2 v0 .",
    "this means that expansion leaves excess pions , relative to the equilibrium number at the given energy density . the relaxation of this excess particle number controls equilibration and bulk viscosity .",
    "next we turn to the collision term . at",
    "lowest ( fourth ) order in @xmath36 , the collision term contains only elastic @xmath37 scattering .",
    "such terms drive @xmath26 towards its equilibrium form _ except _ that they can not change total particle number .",
    "that is , there is no solution to the linearized boltzmann equation with eq .",
    "( [ eq : source ] ) on the lefthand side and only @xmath37 collision processes on the righthand side , since the lefthand side includes a change to the net particle number while the righthand side can not change particle number .",
    "therefore a calculation involving only number - conserving processes is incomplete and inconsistent , as emphasized by jeon @xcite in the context of scalar @xmath38 theory.s other than @xmath39 in the boltzmann equation . ] therefore we must include as well the lowest order number - changing process . since qcd is parity symmetric but the pion is a parity - odd scalar , all interaction terms are even in the pion field and the lowest order kinematically allowed number - changing process is @xmath40 .    at this point there is a simplification . as in the case of scalar @xmath38 theory @xcite ( but unlike the case of weakly coupled qcd @xcite ) , number - changing processes are much less efficient than number - conserving processes in a pion gas .",
    "number conserving processes drive the nonequilibrium distribution function @xmath41 towards an almost - equilibrium form , but with a chemical potential for particle number , f^a _ ( ) ( - 1 ) ^-1 . here",
    "@xmath42 is determined by the condition that the energy content of @xmath43 is the same as the energy content of @xmath44 . but number conserving processes can not lead to the relaxation of @xmath45 towards zero , because the elastic collision term vanishes if @xmath46 : 0 = -c_elastic[f _ ] & = & 12 ! _ b,cd",

    "second , as the temperature gets lower , the typical momentum scale for pions gets lower .",

    "the probability to have _ four _ pions in one place at one time , to participate in a number - changing collision , is therefore _ exponentially _ small , so the rate of number changing processes is exponentially suppressed and the bulk viscosity becomes exponentially large .",

    "factoring it out of the integral , and approximating @xmath124 , the remaining angular integrations can be performed easily .",

    "( [ eq : entropy ] ) , @xmath129 . these low temperature asymptotics are consistent with our numerical results .",
