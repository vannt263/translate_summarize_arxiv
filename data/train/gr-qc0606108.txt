    "_ contribution to ` towards quantum gravity , ' edited by d. oriti , cambridge university press , 2006 .",
    "_      any of us who has used the global positioning system ( gps ) in one of the gadgets of everyday life has also relied on the accuracy of the predictions of einstein s theory of gravity , general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "gps systems accurately provide your position relative to satellites positioned thousands of kilometres from the earth , and their ability to do so requires being able to understand time and position measurements to better than 1 part in @xmath0 .",
    "such an accuracy is comparable to the predicted relativistic effects for such measurements in the earth s gravitational field , which are of order @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is newton s constant , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the earth s mass and mean radius , and @xmath5 is the speed of light .",
    "gr also does well when compared with other precise measurements within the solar system , as well as in some extra - solar settings @xcite .",
    "so we live in an age when engineers must know about general relativity in order to understand why some their instruments work so accurately . and",
    "yet we also are often told there is a crisis in reconciling gr with quantum mechanics , with the size of quantum effects being said to be infinite ( or  what is the same  to be unpredictable ) for gravitating systems .",
    "but since precision agreement with experiment implies agreement within both theoretical and observational errors , and since uncomputable quantum corrections fall into the broad category of ( large ) theoretical error , how can uncontrolled quantum errors be consistent with the fantastic success of classical gr as a precision description of gravity ?    this chapter aims to explain how this puzzle is resolved , by showing why quantum effects in fact _ are _ calculable within gr , at least for systems which are sufficiently weakly curved ( in a sense explained quantitatively below ) .",
    "since all of the extant measurements are performed within such weakly - curved environments , quantum corrections to them can be computed and are predicted to be fantastically small . in this sense we quantitatively understand _ why _ the classical approximation to gr works so well within the solar system , and so why in practical situations quantum corrections to gravity need not be included as an uncontrolled part of the budget of overall theoretical error .",
    "more precisely , the belief that quantum effects are incalculable within gr arises because gr is what is called a non - renormalizable theory .",
    "non - renormalizability means that the short - wavelength divergences  which are ubiquitous within quantum field theory  can not be absorbed into the definitions of a finite number of parameters ( like masses and charges ) , as they are in renormalizable theories like quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) or the standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "although this does preclude making quantum predictions _ of arbitrary accuracy _ , it does not preclude making predictions to any finite order in an appropriate low - energy expansion , and this is what allows the predictivity on which precise comparison with experiment relies .",
    "in fact gravity is not at all special in this regard , as we know of other non - renormalizable theories which describe nature  such as the chiral perturbation theory which describes the low - energy interactions of pions and kaons , or the fermi theory of the weak interactions , or a wide variety of condensed matter models . in many of these other systems",
    "quantum corrections are not only computable , they can be measured , with results which agree remarkably well with observations .    one thing",
    "this chapter is _ not _ intended to do is to argue that it is silly to think about the problems of quantum gravity , or that there are no interesting fundamental issues remaining to be addressed ( such as many of those described elsewhere in these pages ) .",
    "what is intended is instead to identify more precisely where these more fundamental issues become important ( at very short distances ) , and why they do not hopelessly pollute the detailed comparison of gr with observations .",
    "my presentation here follows that of my longer review of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the arguments given here are provided in more detail .",
    "since the perceived difficulties with calculating quantum corrections in weak gravitational fields revolve around the problem of calculating with non - renormalizable theories , the first step is to describe the modern point of view as to how this should be done .",
    "it is convenient to do so first with a simpler toy model , before returning to gr in all of its complicated glory .",
    "consider therefore the theory of a complex scalar field , @xmath6 , described by the lagrangian density @xmath7 with the following scalar potential @xmath8 this theory is renormalizable , so we can compute its quantum implications in some detail .",
    "since we return to it below , it is worth elaborating briefly on the criterion for renormalizability . to this end",
    "we follow standard practice and define the ` engineering ' dimension of a coupling as @xmath9 , where the coupling is written as ( mass)@xmath10 in units where @xmath11 ( which are used throughout ) .",
    "for instance the coupling @xmath12 which pre - multiplies @xmath13 above is dimensionless in these units , and so has @xmath14 , while the coupling @xmath15 pre - multiplying @xmath16 has @xmath17 .",
    "a theory is renormalizable if @xmath18 for all of its couplings , and if for any given dimension all possible couplings have been included consistent with the symmetries of the theory .",
    "both of these are clearly true for the lagrangian of eqs .",
    "( [ abeltoymodel ] ) and ( [ toypotential ] ) , since all possible terms are written consistent with @xmath18 and the @xmath19 symmetry @xmath20 .",
    "we next analyze the spectrum and interactions , within the semiclassical approximation which applies in the limit @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the field takes a nonzero expectation value , @xmath22 , in the vacuum .",
    "the particle spectrum about this vacuum consists of two weakly - interacting particle types , one of which ",
    "@xmath23  is massless and the other ",
    "@xmath24  has mass @xmath25 .",
    "these particles interact with one another through an interaction potential of the form @xmath26",
    "^ 2,\\ ] ] as may be seen by writing @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , these interactions imply the following invariant scattering amplitude for the scattering process",
    "@xmath28 @xmath29 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this amplitude has an interesting property in the limit that the center - of - mass scattering energy , @xmath30 , is much smaller than the mass @xmath31 . as may be explored by expanding @xmath32 in powers of external four - momenta , in this limit the @xmath33 and @xmath34 terms both vanish , leaving a result @xmath35 .",
    "clearly the massless particles interact more weakly than would be expected given a cursory inspection of the scalar potential , eq .",
    "( [ potl ] ) .",
    "the weakness of the scattering of @xmath23 particles at low energy is a consequence of their being nambu - goldstone bosons @xcite for the theory s @xmath19 symmetry : @xmath36 .",
    "this can be seen more explicitly by changing variables to polar coordinates in field space , @xmath37 , rather than the variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in terms of @xmath38 and",
    "@xmath39 the action of the @xmath19 symmetry is simply @xmath40 , and the model s lagrangian becomes : @xmath41 and semiclassical calculations can be performed as before by expanding in terms of canonically - normalized fluctuations : @xmath42 and @xmath43 , revealing that @xmath44 describes the massive particle while @xmath45 describes the massless one . because @xmath45 appears in @xmath46 only explicitly differentiated ( as it must because of the symmetry @xmath47 ) , its scattering is suppressed by powers of @xmath48 at low energies .      properties such as this which arise ( sometimes unexpectedly ) when observables are expanded at low energies in powers of @xmath48 are explored most easily by ` integrating out ' the heavy particle to construct the _ effective field theory _ describing the low - energy dynamics of the massless particle alone .",
    "one way to do so in the case under consideration here would be to define ` light ' degrees of freedom to be those modes ( in momentum space ) of @xmath45 which satisfy @xmath49 ( in euclidean signature ) , for some cutoff @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 .",
    "all other modes are , by definition , ` heavy ' . denoting the heavy and light modes schematically by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , then the effective theory governing the light fields",
    "may be defined by @xmath54 = \\int { \\cal d}h_\\lambda \\ ; \\exp\\left [ i \\int d^4x \\ ; { \\cal l}(\\ell , h ) \\right ] \\,,\\ ] ] where the functional integral is performed over all of the heavy modes ( including the large - momentum components of @xmath45 ) .",
    "@xmath55 defined this way necessarily depends on @xmath50 , but it does so in just the way required in order to have @xmath50 cancel with the explicit @xmath50 s which cut off the loop integrals for the functional integration over the light fields , @xmath53 .",
    "all @xmath50 s must cancel in observables because @xmath50 is just a bookmark which we use to organize the calculation .",
    "because of this cancellation the detailed form of the regularization is largely immaterial and can be chosen for convenience of calculation .    for this reason",
    "it is actually preferable instead to define @xmath56 using dimensional regularization rather than a cutoff .",
    "paradoxically , this is possible even though one keeps both short- and long - wavelength modes of the light fields in the low - energy theory when dimensionally regularizing , which seems to contradict the spirit of what a low - energy effective theory is . in practice",
    "it is possible because the difference between the cutoff- and dimensionally - regularized low - energy theory can itself be parameterized by an appropriate choice for the effective couplings within the low - energy theory .",
    "this is the choice we shall make below when discussing quantum effects within the effective theory .    with this definition , physical observables at low energies",
    "are now computed by performing the remaining path integral over the light degrees of freedom only , weighted by the low - energy effective lagrangian : @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the effects of virtual contributions of heavy states appear within this low - energy theory through the contributions of new effective interactions .",
    "when applied to the toy model to leading order in @xmath58 this leads to the following result for @xmath55 : @xmath59 \\ , ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ellipses in @xmath46 represent terms which are suppressed by more than four inverse powers of @xmath31 .",
    "the inverse powers of @xmath31 which pre - multiply all of the interactions in this lagrangian are a consequence of the virtual @xmath44 exchanges which are required in order to produce them within the full theory .",
    "the explicit numerical factors in each term are an artifact of leading order perturbation theory , and receive corrections order by order in @xmath58 .",
    "computing 2-particle scattering using this effective theory gives a result for which the low - energy suppression by powers of @xmath48 are explicit due to the derivative form of the interactions .",
    "what is interesting about the lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ leffform ] ) , for the present purposes is that the successive effective couplings involve successively more powers of @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , this keeps them from having non - negative engineering dimension and so makes the effective theory manifestly non - renormalizable . if someone were to hand us this theory we might therefore throw up our hands and conclude that we can not predictively compute quantum corrections .",
    "however in this case we know this theory simply expresses the low - energy limit of a full theory which _ is _ renormalizable , and so for which quantum corrections can be explicitly computed .",
    "why ca nt these corrections also be expressed using the effective theory ?",
    "the answer is that they can , and this is by far the most efficient way to compute these corrections to observables in the low - energy limit where @xmath61 .",
    "the key to computing these corrections is to systematically exploit the low - energy expansion in powers of @xmath48 which underlies using the action , eq .",
    "( [ leffform ] ) in the first place .      to explore quantum effects consider evaluating loop graphs using the toy - model effective lagrangian , which we may write in the general form @xmath62 where the sum is over interactions , @xmath63 , involving @xmath64 powers of the dimensionless field @xmath38 and @xmath65 derivatives .",
    "the power of @xmath31 pre - multiplying each term is chosen to ensure that the coefficient @xmath66 is dimensionless , and we have seen that these coefficients are @xmath67 at leading order in @xmath12 . to be completely explicit ,",
    "in the case of the interaction @xmath68 we have @xmath69 and we found earlier that @xmath70 for this term .",
    "notice that lorentz invariance requires @xmath65 must be even , and the @xmath19 symmetry implies every factor of @xmath38 is differentiated at least once , and so @xmath71 . we may ignore all terms with @xmath72 since these are linear in @xmath73 and so must be a total derivative .",
    "furthermore , the only term with @xmath74 is the kinetic term , which we take as the unperturbed lagrangian , and so for the interactions we may restrict the sum to @xmath75 .    with these definitions it is straightforward to track the powers of @xmath76 and @xmath31 that interactions of the form ( [ genformleff ] ) contribute to an @xmath77-loop contribution to a scattering amplitude , @xmath78 , at centre - of - mass energy @xmath30 .",
    "( the steps presented here closely follow the discussion of refs .",
    "imagine using this lagrangian to compute a contribution to the scattering amplitude , @xmath78 , coming from a feynman graph involving @xmath79 external lines ; @xmath80 internal lines and @xmath81 vertices .",
    "( the subscript @xmath64 here counts the number of lines which converge at the vertex , while @xmath82 counts the power of momentum which appears . )",
    "these constants are not all independent , since they are related by the identity @xmath83 .",
    "it is also convenient to trade the number of internal lines , @xmath80 , for the number of loops , @xmath77 , defined by @xmath84 .",
    "we now use dimensional analysis to estimate the result of performing the integration over the internal momenta , using dimensional regularization to regulate the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "if all external momenta and energies are of order @xmath30 then the size of a dimensionally - regularized integral is given on dimensional grounds by the appropriate power of @xmath30 , we find @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "this is the main result , since it shows which graphs contribute to any order in @xmath48 using a nonrenormalizable theory . , which drops out of the final answer for an observable in any case . ]    to see how eqs .",
    "( [ pcresult1 ] ) are used , consider the first few powers of @xmath30 in the toy model . for any @xmath79",
    "the leading contributions for small @xmath30 come from _ tree _ graphs , _",
    "i.e. _  those having @xmath87 .",
    "the tree graphs that dominate are those for which @xmath88 takes the smallest possible value .",
    "for example , for 2-particle scattering @xmath89 and so precisely one tree graph is possible for which @xmath90 , corresponding to @xmath91 and all other @xmath92 .",
    "this identifies the single graph which dominates the 4-point function at low energies , and shows that the resulting leading energy dependence in this case is @xmath93 , as was also found earlier in the full theory .",
    "the numerical coefficient can be obtained in terms of the effective couplings by more explicit evaluation of the appropriate feynman graph .",
    "the next - to - leading behavior is also easily computed using the same arguments .",
    "order @xmath94 contributions are achieved if and only if either : ( _ i _ ) @xmath95 and @xmath96 , with all others zero ; or ( _ ii _ ) @xmath87 and @xmath97 .",
    "since there are no @xmath98 interactions , no one - loop graphs having 4 external lines can be built using precisely one @xmath99 vertex and so only tree graphs can contribute .",
    "of these , the only two choices allowed by @xmath100 at order @xmath94 are therefore the choices : @xmath101 , or @xmath102 .",
    "both of these contribute a result of order @xmath103 .    besides showing how to use the effective theory to compute to any order in @xmath48 , eq .",
    "( [ pcresult2 ] ) also shows the domain of approximation of the effective - theory calculation .",
    "the validity of perturbation theory within the effective theory relies only on the assumptions @xmath104 and @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , it does _ not _ rely on the ratio @xmath105 being small , even though there is a factor of this order appearing for each loop .",
    "this factor does not count loops in the effective theory because it is partially cancelled by another factor , @xmath48 , which also comes with every loop .",
    "@xmath106 _ does _ count loops within the full theory , of course .",
    "this calculation simply shows that the small-@xmath58 approximation is only relevant for predicting the values of the effective couplings , but are irrelevant to the problem of computing the energetics of scattering amplitudes given these couplings .",
    "_ step iii : _ use a calculation like the one above to identify which effective couplings in @xmath107 can contribute to the observable of interest to the desired order in @xmath48 .",
    "this always requires only a finite number ( say : @xmath108 ) of terms in @xmath55 to any finite accuracy .        _ step iv - b : _ if the underlying theory is unknown , or is too complicated to permit the calculation of @xmath56 , then leave the @xmath108 required coefficients as free parameters .",
    "the procedure is nevertheless predictive if more than @xmath108 observables can be identified whose predictions depend only on these parameters .",
    "the effective lagrangian is in this way seen to be predictive even though it is not renormalizable in the usual sense .",
    "renormalizable theories are simply the special case of step _ iv - b _ where one stops at zeroeth order in @xmath48 , and so are the ones which dominate in the limit that the light and heavy scales are very widely separated .",
    "in fact , this is _",
    "why _ renormalizable interactions are so important when describing nature .",
    "the success of the above approach is well - established in many areas outside of gravitational physics , with non - renormalizability being the signal that one is seeing the virtual effects due to some sort of heavier physics . historically , one of earliest examples known was the non - renormalizable interactions of chiral perturbation theory which describe well the low - energy scattering of pions , kaons and nucleons .",
    "it is noteworthy that this success requires the inclusion of the loop corrections within this effective theory .",
    "the heavier physics in this case is the confining physics of the quarks and gluons from which these particles are built , and whose complicated dynamics has so far precluded calculating the effective couplings from first principles .",
    "the effective theory works so long as one restricts to center - of - mass energies smaller than roughly 1 gev .",
    "the fermi ( or @xmath109 ) theory of the weak interactions is a similar example , which describes the effects of virtual @xmath110-boson exchange at energies well below the @xmath110-boson mass , @xmath111 gev .",
    "this theory provides an efficient description of the low - energy experiments , with an effective coupling , @xmath112 which in this case is calculable in terms of the mass and coupling , @xmath113 , of the @xmath110 boson . in this case agreement with the precision of the measurements",
    "again requires the inclusion of loops within the effective theory .",
    "given the previous discussion of of the toy model , it is time to return to the real application of interest for this chapter : general relativity .",
    "the goal is to be able to describe quantitatively quantum processes in gr , and to be able to compute the size of quantum corrections to the classical processes on which the tests of gr are founded .",
    "historically , the main obstacle to this program has been that gr is not renormalizable , as might be expected given that its coupling ( newton s constant ) , @xmath114 , has engineering dimension ( mass)@xmath115 in units where @xmath116 .",
    "but we have seen that non - renormalizable theories can be predictive in much the same way as are renormalizable ones , provided that they are interpreted as being the low - energy limit of some more fundamental microscopic theory . for gravity , this more microscopic theory is as yet unknown , although these pages contain several proposals for what it might be .",
    "happily , as we have seen for the toy model , their effective use at low energies does not require knowledge of whatever this microscopic theory might be .",
    "in this section the goal is to identify more thoroughly what the precise form of the low - energy theory really is for gravity , as well as to identify what the scales are above which the effective theory should not be applied .",
    "for gr the low - energy fields consist of the metric itself , @xmath117 . furthermore , since we do not know what the underlying , more microscopic theory is , we can not hope to compute the effective theory from first principles .",
    "experience with the toy model of the previous section instead suggests we should construct the most general effective lagrangian which is built from the metric and organize it into a derivative expansion , with the terms with the fewest derivatives being expected to dominate at low energies .",
    "furthermore we must keep only those effective interactions which are consistent with the symmetries of the problem , which for gravity we can take to be general covariance .",
    "these considerations lead us to expect that the einstein - hilbert action of gr should be considered to be just one term in an expansion of the action in terms of derivatives of the metric tensor .",
    "general covariance requires this to be written in terms of powers of the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the metric s riemann tensor , @xmath120 is its ricci tensor , and @xmath121 is the ricci scalar , each of which involves precisely two derivatives of the metric .    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ gravaction ] ) is the cosmological constant , which is dropped in what follows since observations imply @xmath58 is ( for some reason ) extremely small .",
    "once this is done the leading term in the derivative expansion is the einstein - hilbert action whose coefficient , @xmath122 gev , has dimensions of squared mass , whose value defines newton s constant .",
    "this is followed by curvature - squared terms having dimensionless effective couplings , @xmath123 , and curvature - cubed terms with couplings inversely proportional to a mass , @xmath124 , ( not all of which are written in eq .",
    "( [ gravaction ] ) ) .",
    "although the numerical value of @xmath125 is known , the mass scale @xmath31 appearing in the curvature - cubed ( and higher ) terms is not .",
    "but since it appears in the denominator it is the lowest mass scale which has been integrated out which should be expected to dominate .",
    "for this reason @xmath31 is unlikely to be @xmath125 , and one might reasonably use the electron mass , @xmath126 gev , or neutrino masses , @xmath127 gev , when considering applications over the distances relevant in astrophysics .    experience with the toy model shows that not all of the interactions in the lagrangian ( [ gravaction ] ) need contribute independently ( or at all ) to physical observables .",
    "for instance , for most applications we may drop total derivatives ( like @xmath128 ) , as well as those terms which can be eliminated by performing judicious field redefinitions @xcite .",
    "since the existence of these terms does not affect the arguments about to be made , we do not bother to identify and drop these terms explicitly here .      of all of the terms in the effective action ,",
    "only the einstein - hilbert term is familiar from applications of classical gr .",
    "although we expect naively that this should dominate at low energies ( since it involves the fewest derivatives ) , we now make this more precise by identifying which interactions contribute to which order in a low - energy expansion .",
    "we do so by considering the low - energy scattering of weak gravitational waves about flat space , and by repeating the power - counting exercise performed above for the toy model to keep track of how different effective couplings contribute . in this way",
    "we can see how the scales @xmath125 and @xmath31 enter into observables .    in order to perform this power counting",
    "we expand the above action flat space , trading the full metric for a canonically normalized fluctuation : @xmath129 .",
    "for the present purposes what is important is that the expansion of the curvature tensor ( and its ricci contractions ) produces terms involving all possible powers of @xmath130 , with each term involving precisely two derivatives .",
    "proceeding as before gives an estimate for the leading energy - dependence of an @xmath77-loop contribution to the a scattering amplitude , @xmath32 , which involves @xmath79 external lines and @xmath131 vertices involving @xmath65 derivatives and @xmath64 attached graviton lines .",
    "( the main difference from the previous section s analysis is the appearance here of interactions involving two derivatives , coming from the einstein - hilbert term . )",
    "this leads to the estimate : @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the prime on both of these sums indicates the omission of the case @xmath98 from the sum over @xmath65 .",
    "grouping instead the terms involving powers of @xmath77 and @xmath81 , eq .",
    "( [ grcount1 ] ) becomes @xmath135^{v_{id } } \\,.\\ ] ] notice that no negative powers of @xmath30 appear here because @xmath65 is even and because of the condition @xmath136 in the product .",
    "this last expression is the result we seek because it is what shows how to make systematic quantum predictions for graviton scattering .",
    "it does so by showing that the predictions of the full gravitational effective lagrangian ( involving all powers of curvatures ) can be organized into powers of @xmath137 and @xmath48 , and so we can hope to make sensible predictions provided that both of these two quantities are small .",
    "furthermore , all of the corrections involve powers of @xmath138 and/or @xmath139 , implying that they may be expected to be _ extremely _ small for any applications for which @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , notice that even if @xmath140 then @xmath141 if @xmath31 is taken to be the electron mass .",
    "( notice that factors of the larger parameter @xmath48 do not arise until curvature - cubed interactions are important , and this first occurs at subleading order in @xmath137 . )",
    "furthermore , it shows in detail what we were in any case inclined to believe : that classical general relativity governs the dominant low - energy dynamics of gravitational waves .",
    "this can be seen by asking which graphs are least suppressed by these small energy ratios , which turns out to be those for which @xmath87 and @xmath142 .",
    "that is , arbitrary tree graphs constructed purely from the einstein - hilbert action  precisely the predictions of classical general relativity .",
    "for instance , for 2-graviton scattering we have @xmath100 , and so the above arguments predict the dominant energy - dependence to be @xmath143 .",
    "this is borne out by explicit tree - level calculations @xcite for graviton scattering , which give : @xmath144 for an appropriate choice of graviton polarizations .",
    "here @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the usual lorentz - invariant mandelstam variables built from the initial and final particle four momenta , all of which are proportional to @xmath148 .",
    "this shows both that @xmath149 to leading order , and that it is the physical , invariant centre - of - mass energy , @xmath30 , which is the relevant energy for the power - counting analysis .",
    "but the real beauty of a result like eq .",
    "( [ grcount1a ] ) is that it also identifies which graphs give the subdominant corrections to classical gr .",
    "the leading such a correction arises in one of two ways : either ( _ i _ ) @xmath95 and @xmath92 for any @xmath150 ; or ( _ ii _ ) @xmath87 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 is arbitrary , and all other @xmath131 vanish .",
    "that is , compute the one - loop corrections using only einstein gravity ; or instead work to tree level and include precisely one vertex from one of the curvature - squared interactions in addition to any number of interactions from the einstein - hilbert term .",
    "both are suppressed compared to the leading term by a factor of @xmath138 , and the one - loop contribution carries an additional factor of @xmath153 .",
    "this ( plus logarithmic complications due to infrared divergences ) are also borne out by explicit one - loop calculations @xcite .",
    "although the use of curvature - squared terms potentially introduces additional effective couplings into the results , useful predictions can nonetheless be made provided more observables are examined than there are free parameters .",
    "although conceptually instructive , calculating graviton scattering is at this point a purely academic exercise , and is likely to remain so until gravitational waves are eventually detected and their properties are measured in detail . in practice it is of more pressing interest to obtain these power - counting estimates for observables which are of more direct interest for precision measurements of gr , such as within the solar system .",
    "it happens that the extension to these kinds of observables is often not straightforward ( and in some cases has not yet been done in a completely systematic way ) , because they involve non - relativistic sources ( like planets and stars ) .",
    "non - relativistic sources considerably complicate the above power - counting arguments because they introduce a new dimensionless small quantity , @xmath154 , whose dependence is not properly captured by the simple dimensional arguments given above @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the leading corrections have been computed for some kinds of non - relativistic sources in asymptotically - flat spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these show that while relativistic corrections to the observables situated a distance @xmath155 away from a gravitating mass @xmath156 are of order @xmath157 , the leading quantum corrections are suppressed by powers of the much smaller quantity @xmath158 . for instance , while on the surface of the sun relativistic corrections are of order @xmath159 , quantum corrections are completely negligible , being of order @xmath160 . clearly the classical approximation to gr is _ extremely _ good for solar - system applications .    another important limitation to the discussion as given above is its restriction to perturbations about flat space .",
    "after all , quantum effects are also of interest for small fluctuations about other spacetimes .",
    "in particular , quantum fluctuations generated during a past epoch of cosmological inflationary expansion appear to provide a good description of the observed properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "similarly , phenomena like hawking radiation rely on quantum effects near black holes , and the many foundational questions these raise have stimulated their extensive theoretical study , even though these studies may not lead in the near term to observational consequences .",
    "both black holes and cosmology provide regimes for which detailed quantum gravitational predictions are of interest , but for which perturbations about flat space need not directly apply .",
    "a proper power - counting of the size of quantum corrections is also possible for these kinds of spacetimes by examining perturbations about the relevant cosmological or black - hole geometry , although in these situations momentum - space techniques are often less useful .",
    "position - space methods , like operator - product expansions , can then provide useful alternatives , although as of this writing comparatively few explicit power - counting calculations have been done using these .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the longer review , @xcite , for more discussion of this , as well as of related questions which arise concerning the use of effective field theories within time - dependent backgrounds and in the presence of event horizons .",
    "general relativity provides a detailed quantitative description of gravitational experiments in terms of a field theory which is not renormalizable .",
    "it is the purpose of the present article to underline the observation that gravity is not the only area of physics for which a non - renormalizable theory is found to provide a good description of experimental observations , and we should use this information to guide our understanding of what the limits to validity might be to its use .    the lesson from other areas of physics is clear : the success of a non - renormalizable theory points to the existence of a new short - distance scale whose physics is partially relevant to the observations of interest .",
    "what makes this problematic for understanding the theory s quantum predictions is that it is often the case that we do often not understand what the relevant new physics is , and so its effects must be parameterized in terms of numerous unknown effective couplings .",
    "how can predictions be made in such a situation ?    what makes predictions possible is the observation that only comparatively few of these unknown couplings are important at low energies ( or long distances ) , and so only a finite number of them enter into predictions at any fixed level of accuracy .",
    "predictions remain possible so long as more observables are computed than there are parameters , but explicit progress relies on being able to identify which of the parameters enter into predictions to any given degree of precision .    in the previous pages",
    "it is shown how this identification can be made for the comparatively simple case of graviton scattering in flat space , for which case the size of the contribution from any given effective coupling can be explicitly estimated .",
    "the central tool is a power - counting estimate which tracks the power of energy which enters into any given feynman graph , and which duplicates for gr the similar estimates which are made in other areas of physics .",
    "the result shows how general relativity emerges is the leading contribution to an effective theory of some more fundamental picture , with its classical contributions being shown to be the dominant ones , but with computable corrections which can be explicitly evaluated in a systematic expansion to any given order in a low - energy expansion .",
    "this shows how a theory s non - renormalizability need not preclude its use for making sensible quantum predictions , provided these are made only for low energies and long distances .",
    "this kind of picture is satisfying because it emphasizes the similarity between many of the problems which are encountered in gr and in other areas of physics .",
    "it is also conceptually important because it provides control over the size of the theoretical errors which quantum effects would introduce into the classical calculations against which precision measurements of general relativity are compared .",
    "these estimates show that the errors associated with ignoring quantum effects is negligible for the systems of practical interest .",
    "there is a sense for which this success is mundane , in that it largely confirms our prejudices as to the expected size of quantum effects for macroscopic systems based purely on dimensional analysis performed by building dimensionless quantities out of the relevant parameters like @xmath2 , @xmath161 , @xmath5 , @xmath156 and @xmath162 .",
    "however the power - counting result is much more powerful : it identifies which feynman graphs contribute at any given power of energy , and so permits the detailed calculation of observables as part of a systematic low - energy expansion .",
    "it is certainly true the small size of quantum contributions in the solar system in no way reduces the fundamental mysteries described elsewhere in these pages that must be resolved in order to properly understand quantum gravity at fundamentally small distances .",
    "however it is important to understand that these problems are associated with small distance scales and not with large ones , since this focusses the discussion as to what is possible and what is not when entertaining modifications to gr . in particular , although it shows that we are comparatively free to modify gravity at short distances without ruining our understanding of gravitational physics within the solar system , it also shows that we are not similarly protected from _",
    "long_-distance modifications to gr .",
    "this observation is consistent with long experience , which shows that it is notoriously difficult to modify gr at long distances in a way which does not introduce unacceptable problems such as various sorts of instabilities to the vacuum .",
    "such vacuum - stability problems are often simply ignored in some circles on the grounds that ` quantum gravity ' is not yet understood , in the hope that once it is it will somehow also fix the stability issues .",
    "however our ability to quantify the size of low - energy quantum effects in gravity shows that we need not await a more complete understanding of gravity at high energies in order to make accurate predictions at low energies . and",
    "since the vacuum is the lowest - energy state there is , we can not expect unknown short - distance physics to be able to save us from long - distance sicknesses .",
    "calculability at low energies is a double - edged sword .",
    "it allows us to understand why precision comparison between gr and experiment is possible in the solar system , but it equally forces us to reject alternative theories which have low - energy problems ( like instabilities ) as being inadequate .",
