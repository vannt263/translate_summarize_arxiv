    "the supernova ( sn ) explosions blow out the various heavy elements generated by the nucleosynthesis process inside the progenitor stars .",
    "meanwhile , the blast wave formed by the sn explosion sweeps up and heats the interstellar matter ( ism ) . in this way , the abundance of the progenitor star or the ism are measured from the observation of the supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "the cygnus loop is one of the brightest snrs in the x - ray sky .",
    "its age is estimated to be @xmath110,000 yr and the distance is comparatively close to us ( 540pc ; @xcite ) . the large apparent size ( @xmath2.5 ; @xcite ) enables us to study the plasma structure of the loop .",
    "although the cygnus loop is an evolved snr , a hot plasma is still confined inside the loop ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite observed the loop with the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( _ asca _ ) , and detected strong highly - ionized si - k , s - k , and fe - l lines near the center of the cygnus loop .",
    "they concluded that a hot plasma , a `` fossil '' of the supernova explosion , is left in the core of the loop .",
    "tsunemi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) observed the cygnus loop along the diameter from the northeast ( ne ) to the southwest ( sw ) with _ xmm - newton _ and studied the radial plasma structure . from the spectral analysis",
    ", they showed that the cygnus loop consists of two components with different temperatures and metal abundances .",
    "they concluded that the low-@xmath0 component originating from the cavity - wall component surrounds the high-@xmath0 ejecta component .",
    "in addition , they measured the metal abundances of the high-@xmath0 component and showed the metal distribution of the ejecta .",
    "the results indicate that the abundances are relatively high ( @xmath15 times solar ) and each element is non - uniformly distributed : si , s and fe are concentrated in the inner region while the other elements such as o , ne and mg are abundant in the outer region .",
    "@xcite and @xcite expanded the observations southward and northward respectively with the _ suzaku _ observatory in 7 and 10 pointings , and examined the plasma structure in their field of view ( fov ) .",
    "@xcite divided their fov into 119 cells and , performed the spectral analysis .",
    "they showed that si and fe are more concentrated in the south part than that in the north part .",
    "this indicates a clear asymmetric structure of the metal abundances .",
    "@xcite divided their fov into 45 rectangular regions from ne to sw and also showed the asymmetric distribution of each heavy element ; the ejecta of o , ne , mg are distributed more in the ne , while those of si , fe are distributed more in the sw .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also calculated the progenitor mass of the cygnus loop and concluded that the cygnus loop is originated from the 12 - 15explosion .",
    "@xcite also estimated the progenitor mass to be 15from the size of the cavity .",
    "these results show that the progenitor star of the cygnus loop was a massive star and caused a core - collapse explosion .",
    "it is striking that an asymmetric explosion is suggested as the origin of the cygnus loop from the metal distributions .",
    "the cygnus loop is a typical shell - like snr ; this structure is thought to be generated by a cavity explosion @xcite .",
    "the morphology is almost circular while we can see the breakout in the south called the `` blow - out '' region @xcite .",
    "the origin of the `` blow - out '' is not well understood .",
    "@xcite have explained this extended structure as a breakout into a lower density ism . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite suggested the existence of a secondary snr ( named g72.9 - 9.0 ) in the south based on radio observation and some other radio observations support this conclusion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite observed the blow - out region with the _ xmm - newton _ observatory and showed that the x - ray spectra of this region consist of a two-@xmath0 plasma component .",
    "judging from the plasma temperatures and the metal distributions , @xcite concluded that the x - ray emission is consistent with a cygnus loop origin and that the high- and low-@xmath3 components derived from the ejecta and the cavity - wall , respectively .",
    "they also showed that the x - ray shell is thin in the blow - out region and concluded that the origin of the blow - out can be explained as a breakout into a lower density ism as proposed by @xcite .    in this paper , we used 14 and 7 pointings observation data obtained by the _ suzaku _ and the _ xmm - newton _ observatories .",
    "we reanalyzed all the data to study the metal distributions inside the cygnus loop .",
    "we summarized the 21 observations in table [ tab : info ] .",
    "all of the suzaku data were analyzed with version 6.5 of the heasoft tools . for the reduction of the _ suzaku _ data",
    ", we used the version 9 of the suzaku software .",
    "the calibration database ( caldb ) used was the one updated in july 2008 .",
    "we used the revision 2.2 of the cleaned event data and combined the 3@xmath43 and 5@xmath45 event files .",
    "the p03 , p04 , p05 , p06 , p07 , p09 , p11 , and p20 data were taken by using the spaced row charge injection ( sci ) method @xcite which reduces the effect of radiation damage of the xis and recovers the energy resolution . in order to exclude the background flare events , we obtained the good time intervals ( gtis ) by including only times at which the count rates are within @xmath5 of the mean count rates .",
    "since the cygnus loop is a large diffuse source and our fov are filled with the snr s emission , we can not obtain the background spectra from our fov .",
    "we also have no background data from the neighborhood of the cygnus loop .",
    "we therefore applied the lockman hole data for the background subtraction .",
    "we reviewed the effect of the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) .",
    "the flux of the grxe at @xmath6 , @xmath7 is @xmath8erg/@xmath9/s / deg@xmath10 ( 0.7 - 2.0kev ) @xcite .",
    "although the cygnus loop ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) is located outside of the fov of @xcite , this value gives us an upper limit of the grxe at the cygnus loop .",
    "meanwhile , the total count rate of the cygnus loop is 1659 counts / s ( 0.8 - 2.01kev ) @xcite , the flux is estimated to be @xmath13erg/@xmath9/s / deg@xmath10 , assuming that the effective area of the _ rosat _ hri is 80@xmath9 and that the cygnus loop is a circle @xmath14 in diameter .",
    "this value is consistent with the results from our fov .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the effect of the grxe on the cygnus loop is vanishingly small .",
    "the solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) is also considered to be one of the correlates of the soft x - ray background below 1kev @xcite . however , in terms of the cygnus loop , we consider that the swcx is negligible because of the prominent surface brightness of the loop .",
    "thus , the lockman hole data obtained in 2006 and 2007 were applied for the background subtraction .",
    "we selected data whose observation dates were close to those of the cygnus loop observations .",
    "since there were no photons above 3.0kev after the background subtraction , the energy ranges of 0.3 - 3.0kev and 0.4 - 3.0kev were used for xis1 ( back - illuminated ccd ; bi ccd ) and xis0,2,3 ( front - illuminated ccd ; fi ccd ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "all of the _ xmm - newton _ data were processed with version 7.1.0 of the _ xmm _ science analysis system ( sas ) .",
    "the current calibration files ( ccfs ) used were the one updated on june 2008 .",
    "we used the data obtained with the epic mos and pn cameras .",
    "these data were taken by using the medium filters and the prime full - window mode .",
    "we selected x - ray events corresponding to patterns 0 - 12 and flag = 0 for mos 1 and 2 , patterns 0 - 4 and flag = 0 for pn , respectively . in order to exclude the background flare events , we determined the gtis in the same way as the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "after filtering the data , they were vignetting - corrected using the sas task * evigweight*. for the background subtraction , we employed a blank - sky observations prepared by @xcite for similar reason with the _ suzaku _ s case .",
    "after the background subtraction , the energy ranges of 0.3 - 3.0kev were used for each instrument .",
    ".summary of the 21 observations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 150mm,0mm)figure3.eps    ( 60mm,0mm)figure4a.eps ( 60mm,0mm)figure4b.eps ( 60mm,0mm)figure4c.eps ( 60mm,0mm)figure4d.eps ( 60mm,0mm)figure4e.eps",
    "we analyzed all the spectra with using a two - component model : the low-@xmath0 component forms a shell - like structure and the high-@xmath0 component fills inside ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fixed abundances of the low-@xmath15 component are depleted compared to the solar values . @xcite",
    "measured the abundance of the interstellar oxygen in the solar neighborhood along 36 sight lines and showed 0.4 times the solar value .",
    "@xcite employed 0.6 of the total interstellar abundances for the ism oxygen abundance .",
    "the abundances we fixed are significantly lower than those results and it needs to be discussed .",
    "the metal deficiency of the ism component of the cygnus loop has been shown by the earlier x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "the other observations in x - ray by using the _ suzaku _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _",
    "chandra _ also showed the metal depletion at the rim ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite found an enhanced abundance region in the very edge of the ne rim .",
    "the abundance there is about half the solar value which is much higher than those other rim regions .",
    "this result is consistent with the observations of the ism abundance in the solar neighborhood ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the metal abundances of the periphery of the loop may be higher than those observed in x - ray .",
    "any line of sight through the remnant almost certainly intersects various emitting regions .",
    "however , the line of sight near the limb can intersect the very limited plasma condition .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the very rim region @xcite observed consists of thermal plasma with ism abundance while other regions may include either thin thermal plasma with low abundance or non - thermal emission .",
    "@xcite tried to fit the spectrum with a combination of thin thermal plasma with ism abundance and the non - thermal emission .",
    "they reached no clear result probably due to the simplicity of the model .",
    "although most of the rim regions show low abundance from the x - ray data analysis point of view , it still remains an open question .",
    "we noticed that the strong em regions concentrate just south of the geometric center .",
    "si and fe concentrate in the inner part while ne and o have strong regions both in the inner part and the outer part within our fov .",
    "mg has strong regions only in the outer part . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the strong regions near the geometric center .",
    "the contours in figure [ fig : em ] show the em level of @xmath16 of the maximum near the geometric center .",
    "the concentration of the inner part of various metals is obviously away from the geometric center .",
    "the spread of the strong regions indicated by the contour is not clear in the se region due to the lack of observation .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to precisely determine the spread .",
    "taking into account the lack of information in the se region , we speculate that the center of the metal distribution is determined by the centroid of the fe distribution at the south of the geometric center .",
    "we call it the `` metal center '' , which is located on @xmath17 ( j2000 ) , as shown by the light blue cross - mark in figure [ fig : em ] .",
    "we found that the metal center is separated from the geometric center by 25 arcmin toward the south .",
    "it is not clear why it is displaced from the geometric center . on the simple assumption that the sn explosion occurred symmetrically in the uniform ism",
    ", the metals should distribute symmetrically and its center should overlap with the geometric center .",
    "the cygnus loop shows a nearly circular shape with an exception of the south blow - out region .",
    "however , the x - ray surface brightness and the optical filamentation suggest that the ambient medium of the cygnus loop is not uniform .",
    "we consider that its non - uniformity is prominent toward the south blow - out region . if the south blow - out is originated from the lower - density cavity wall or the ism , the displacement of the metal distributions to the south could be naturally explained . in general , the non - uniformity produces the asymmetrical reverse shocks . taking into account the estimated age of the loop",
    ", the reverse shocks should have reached the center of the loop .",
    "however , the times for the reverse shocks to return to the center , @xmath18 significantly depend on the ambient density in the direction which the forward shock propagates . from the recent theoretical calculation , @xcite obtained the relation of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents the ambient density .",
    "therefore , in directions where @xmath20 is higher , the forward shock decelerates and the reverse shock propagates toward the center more quickly . from the morphological point of view , it is suggested that the cavity wall must be very thin in the south blow - out region , although the origin of the blow - out is still not clear .",
    "as described in section [ sec : intro ] , from the radio observations , ( 2002 ; 2004 ) and @xcite claim that the extra snr exists in the south and interacts with the cygnus loop .",
    "their main arguments are the difference of the radio morphology and the polarization intensity between the main part of the loop and the south blow - out .",
    "however , based on the x - ray data , @xcite obtained no evidence that a smaller snr exists at the same distance to the cygnus loop .",
    "they showed that the x - ray spectra in the south are interpretable by the cygnus loop origin .",
    "they also found that the emission from the cavity material of the loop is relatively weak .",
    "it suggests that the x - ray shell is very thin in the south . on the other other hand ,",
    "the ambient medium in the north part of the cygnus loop is thought to be denser than that in the south .",
    "the north areas have the strong emission in x - ray and it suggests that the forward shock has decelerated enough to become radiative in places .",
    "then , the reverse shocks in some part other than south should be formed earlier and reaches the center faster than that in the south . in that case , the pressure exerted by the north reverse shock is higher than that exerted by the south one .",
    "if the metal distributions are formed by the imbalance of the pressure surrounding them , they should be created southward from the geometric center .",
    "our result is consistent with the assumption that the south blow - out is originated not from an extra snr but from a non - uniformity of the cavity wall .",
    "although the metal abundance is not uniform within the high-@xmath0 component , the contents in our fov reflect the abundance of the progenitor star .",
    "we calculate the metal abundances around the metal center and in our fov relative to o in order to compare them with the theoretical models .",
    "we defined the `` metal circle '' which is centered in the metal center with radius of 25arcmin .",
    "we added the em of ejecta component of each region weighting each area of the region for the heavy elements , o , ne , mg , si , and fe . these values reflect the total amount of each heavy element in our fov .",
    "then , we obtained the number ratios of each element relative to o. figure [ fig : ratio ] shows the number ratios of ne , mg , si and fe relative to o of the ejecta component .",
    "the vertical bars show the uncertainties of the values .",
    "the black lines represent the results from the metal circle and the entire fov .",
    "we also plotted the core - collapse models @xcite for various progenitor masses and type ia sn models @xcite for comparison .",
    "the result from the metal circle is similar to that from our entire fov , which suggests the mixing of the metal .",
    "we found that the calculated ne / o , mg / o , and si / o are in good agreement with the core - collapse model with the progenitor mass of 12 .",
    "however , the fe / o ratio is 10 times higher than that of the 12model , and it does not fit any other models . this may be partly because our fov does not cover the entire region of the loop . from figure",
    "[ fig : em ] , we found that the em values of o , ne , mg are higher around our fov rather than those near the center of the loop .",
    "by contrast , si and fe decrease toward the outside of the loop .",
    "if these trend continue to the outside of our fov , we expect that the total ems of o , ne , mg will increase considerably more than those of si and fe . in that case , si / o and fe / o estimated by the whole remnant will decrease and approach the values the core - collapse models rather than those of the type ia sn models .",
    "we can conclude that the progenitor star mass of the cygnus loop is 12 - 15 .",
    "we analyzed the metal distribution of the cygnus loop using 14 and 7 pointings observation data obtained by the _ suzaku _ and the _ xmm - newton _ observatories .",
    "we fit all the spectra by the two-@xmath0 non - equilibrium ionization plasma model ( vnei model ) as shown by the earlier observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results indicate that si and fe are more abundant near the center of the loop than those around our fov .",
    "we measured a center of the si and fe distributions from the metal spread and called it as `` metal center '' .",
    "we found that the metal center is located at the southwest of the geometric center toward the blow - out region .    from the best - fit parameters",
    ", we also estimated the progenitor mass of the cygnus loop .",
    "we calculated the number ratios of the heavy elements ( relative to o ) both from the entire fov and inside the metal circle .",
    "the result from the metal circle is not different from that of our entire fov , which suggests mixing of the metals .",
    "the results show that ne / o , mg / o , and si / o are well fitted by the core - collapse models with progenitor masses of 12 , 13 , 15 .",
    "however , fe / o is 10 times higher than those of the models",
    ". this may be partly because our fov does not cover the entire region of the loop .",
    "we can conclude that the progenitor mass of the cygnus loop is 12 - 15 .",
