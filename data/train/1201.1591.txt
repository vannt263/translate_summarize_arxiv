    "topological defects are a subclass of solitons which are static and owe their existence to their non - trivial boundary conditions ( topology ) .",

    "topological defects attract much attention since they can naturally form due to phase transitions and may have played important roles in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "textures are defects that arise when the _ third _ homotopy group is non - trivial  @xcite , @xmath3 . often called non - singular solitons ( due to the phase of the scalar field which is everywhere well - defined ) they are probably best studied in terms of _ non - linear sigma model _",
    "they have been extensively studied in the past due to the possibility of seeding galaxy formation  @xcite .",
    "s theorem  @xcite , however , provides an obstacle for the existence of stable textures . in @xmath4 dimensions textures",
    "are unstable to collapse .",
    "the reason is that under spatial rescaling the only minimum static energy configuration is the trivial vacuum and thus nothing prevents them from shrinking .",
    "one way to evade this no - go theorem is by having higher order kinetic term(s ) , as has been shown by skyrme  @xcite , who , by adding a kinetic term @xmath5 order in the derivative ( called the _ skyrme term _ ) , obtained static solitonic solutions dubbed as _",
    "skyrmions_. this is possible since the term scales differently than the ordinary kinetic term and as a result the defects have a natural scale .",
    "skyrme interpreted these skyrmions as baryons with baryon number coming from the topological winding number .",
    "as the number of spatial dimensions increases derrick s theorem gives more stringent constraint for the defects stability . in the context of textures",
    "the skyrme term can not support solitonic solutions in higher - than @xmath4 dimensions . in",
    "order to have stable _ extended _ textures we have to have generalized higher - order @xmath6 skyrme kinetic terms .",
    "while it is acceptable as an effective field theory the addition of arbitrary non - canonical terms does not look aesthetic as they unavoidably introduce new scale(s ) in the theory which results in new parameters that must be set by hand . a theory with many adjustably - unrelated parameters",
    "will lose its attractiveness .",
    "moreover , there is no motivation from fundamental physics of why they should exist .",
    "they are simply put by hand to fulfill the purpose of having stable defects . on the other hand ,",
    "the skyrme term itself is ad hoc .",
    "there is no underlying fundamental principle dictating such a term should exist , other than to have stable solutions .",
    "this led people to find generalizations of the skyrme term that can generate any possible higher order terms  @xcite .",
    "one attractive proposal is the so - called _ chiral born - infeld theory _  @xcite . in this theory",
    ", the texture appears in the born - infeld - type lagrangian  @xcite and the higher - order terms are generated automatically via taylor expansion for small mass - scale parameter .    in recent years field theories with dbi ( dirac - born - infeld ) kinetic terms have been intensively studied .",
    "they gain interest due to the fact that the appearance of dbi kinetic form can be motivated from fundamental theory ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath7-brane action ) .",
    "they appear in the string - theory - inspired inflationary model  @xcite where the inflaton has dbi kinetic term . in topological defects",
    "there have been proposals of dbi global strings  @xcite or ( gauge ) cosmic strings  @xcite .",
    "gravitational field of dbi global monopoles has also been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "all of the discussions focus on the existence of defects in @xmath4 dimensions . on the other hand , global @xmath8-defects in arbitrary @xmath0 dimensions",
    "have been shown to exist  @xcite .",
    "this gives an evidence of the existence of stable - static defects with non - canonical kinetic terms in higher dimensions .",

    "have extensively been studied in the context of _ braneworld_. the so - called _ braneworld scenario _ suggests that our @xmath4 dimensional universe is a @xmath9-brane living in a higher - dimensional bulk spacetime  @xcite .",
    "vacuum uncharged @xmath1-branes solutions in arbitrary @xmath7 spacetime have been found by gregroy  @xcite .",
    "these solutions are boost - symmetric along the branes and asymptotically - flat far from the cores .",
    "they , however , suffer from naked singularities . since phenomenologically the branes can be modeled by topological defects  @xcite ,",
    "gregory argued that an appropriate choice of defects core might smooth out the singularity and suggested skyrme model as an example .",
    "indeed , it has recently been shown that einstein - skyrme model in @xmath10 has self - gravitating solitonic @xmath9-branes solutions in its spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the solutions are regular at the core and and the energy - momentum tensor falls fast enough outside so that asymptotically approaches the flat vacuum @xmath1-brane metric .",
    "this is an example of codimension-@xmath9 solitonic defects in higher - dimensional theories .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , so far there has not been any discussion of codimension - higher - than-@xmath9 solitonic defects that can cure the singularities of the thin - wall @xmath1-branes .",
    "this is simply because there are no solitonic defects ( with ordinary kinetic term ) in codimension higher than three .",
    "we might think of using global defects , as in  @xcite , but since their static energy is divergent in flat space their coupling to gravity create deficit angle in the metric and thus can not be asymptotically flat  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we attempt to answer the following two questions .",
    "first , can solitonic defects with codimension @xmath11 , which we dub",
    "_ extended_-solitons , exist ?",
    "second , can we smooth out the singular uncharged @xmath1-branes in arbitrary dimensions ? using the generalization of chiral born - infeld theory  @xcite we found that the answer for both questions is positive .",

    "the advantage of this model is that it does not even require the skyrme term to stabilize the defect .",
