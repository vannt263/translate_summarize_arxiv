    "there is a well - known duality between fokker - planck equations ( fpe ) and stochastic differential equations ( sde ) , which goes back as far as einstein s and langevin s theories of brownian motion ( see risken s book @xcite for a detailed discussion of fp equation and related issues ) .",
    "langevin equations or , more generally , stochastic differential equations , have long been a successful computational tool in quantum stochastics @xcite , allowing for the numerical stochastic integration of systems for which analytical solution would be , at best , extremely difficult .",
    "there are long - standing rules , especially in quantum optics , for beginning with a particular system hamiltonian and mapping this onto stochastic equations of motion for the field variables .",
    "however , this process depends on there being an fp equation equivalent to the master equation for the hamiltonian in question ; that is the partial differential equation for the appropriate probability or pseudoprobability distribution must contain derivatives of no higher than second order . this is the content of pawula s theorem @xcite .",
    "it restricts the method to a certain class of problems which , although containing many interesting cases , is not exhaustive .",
    "a generalised fp equation with higher order derivatives has no mapping onto a stochastic differential equation . as descriptions in terms of fp equations proper are the exception rather than the rule , it is of clear interest to extend present methods to allow for at least the numerical modelling of processes involving higher order noises .    for purposes of numerical simulations , time",
    "may always be regarded as discretised , so the development of a stochastic difference equation _ approximating _ a generalised fp will generally be sufficient .",
    "since pawula s theorem only applies in the continuous time limit , this creates the loophole we need .",
    "what we will show here is that discretised stochastic equations may be devised for generalised fpes , which , in a manner reminiscent of the positive - p representation of quantum optics , require a doubled phase - space . in agreement with pawula s theorem",
    ", the method we use to develop these noises has no natural extension to the continuous time limit .",
    "this notwithstanding , any average corresponding to a physical quantity is expected to be correct in this limit ( whereas the rest of the averages diverge ) .",
    "the question whether a stochastic process in a certain generalised mathematical sense can be defined corresponding to our methods is a subject for futher investigation .",
    "this is not , however , a problem for practical computer simulations , as these are necessarily performed on a discrete time grid .    as in the well - known positive - p representation @xcite ,",
    "nonphysical averages in our method determine the sampling noise .",
    "the fact that they are expected to diverge in the continuous time limit means that sampling noise grows as the time - grid spacing descreases .",
    "this is in contrast to the properties of the wiener process , where sampling noise is independent of the grid spacing for a given sample size . in practice , however , this distinction between the gaussian and higher - order noises is quantitative rather than qualitative , because for a given computing time the sample size necessarily decreases with the grid spacing . in either case",
    "the growth of sampling noise prevents the grid being made too fine .    as a specific example , in this paper we consider a quantum oscillator with kerr nonlinearity .",
    "it is well known that the wigner function of this system obeys a generalised fp equation with 3rd order derivatives .",
    "our goal is to show that the latter is ( approximately ) equivalent to a system of stochastic difference equations .",
    "this equivalence is not straighforward but rather bears a lot of similarity to the positive - p representation known in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore call these equations a positive - w representation of the nonlinear quantum oscillator .",
    "the positive - p representation originates with the single - time p - distribution , yet it allows one to calculate a much wider class of quantum averages @xcite , namely , averages of multi - time , time - normally ordered @xcite operator products .",
    "the positive - p representation may thus be regarded as a constructive mapping of a quantum problem to a classical stochastic problem .",
    "its characterictic property is that time - normal averages are mapped directly on classical averages . in a much similar manner ,",
    "the positive - w equations , which originate with the single - time w - distribution , allow one to calculate multi - time , _ time - wigner ordered _ operator averages .",
    "this new type of operator ordering is introduced in this paper ; to the best of our knowledge it has never been discussed before .",
    "it generalises the single - time symmetric operator ordering , in the same way as the time - normal ordering generalises the single - time normal ordering .",
    "the positive - w representation is hence a constructive mapping of a quantum problem onto a classical stochastic problem , with the characterictic property of relating time - wigner averages directly to classical averages .",
    "the question then is if , rather than taking the usual route from q - number to c - number equations based on phase - space techniques @xcite , the positive - p and the positive - w representations may be derived by directly linking q - number heisenberg equations to c - number langevin equations . in this paper , we show that such a derivation is indeed possible , by employing methods @xcite based on the techniques of quantum field theory .",
    "our considerations closely follow the way in which feynman diagram techniques were derived in textbooks dating back to the fifties and sixties @xcite .",
    "we derive keldysh diagram series @xcite for the kerr oscillator , then recast them as a wyld - type series @xcite , otherwise termed _ causal _ series @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "( more precisely speaking , we derive generating expressions @xcite for these series , avoiding diagram notation as such . )",
    "causal series emerge as solutions to c - number stochastic problems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "given a causal series , it is easy to write a stochastic differential ( or difference ) equation for which this series is a solution @xcite .",
    "this yields strikingly simple and powerful techniques for obtaining stochastic representations of quantum problems .",
    "e.g. , section [ genopo ] where positive - p equations are derived for an optical parametric oscillator , the essence of the derivation being a two - line calculation . )",
    "not the least important property of these techniques is that they can be formulated using simple recipes and then used without any reference to the advanced methods employed in their derivation .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ secqft ] ,",
    "we reiterate the standard techniques of quantum field theory as applied to a nonlinear oscillator .",
    "we discuss in detail causal regularisation @xcite of the propagator , which is necessary to order to make our relations unambiguous .",
    "a functional ( hori s ) form of wick s theorem @xcite is introduced for the normal ordering and then generalised to the case of symmetric ordering .",
    "the result of the section is a pair of closed perturbative relations .",
    "one of them applies when the inital state of the field is characterised via a p - distribution ; the other applies if this state is characterised via a w - distribution @xcite . in section [ seccaus ]",
    ", we investigate the causal structure of the perturbative relations derived in section [ secqft ] .",
    "the concept of causality is introduced via the retarded green s function of the free schrdinger equation . following it , we are able to define the _ input and output _ of a quantum system .",
    "we then show that , physically , the input and output thus introduced correspond to a generalisation of kubo s linear reaction approach @xcite to a full nonlinear quantum - stochastic response problem . in section [ secstoch ]",
    ", we develop techniques ( based on the hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite ) which allow for a constructive mapping of the quantum nonlinear response problem onto a classical nonlinear stochastic response problem . for the oscillator , this results in the positive - p and positive - w representations which we are seeking .",
    "we complete the section with results of computer simulations of the kerr oscillator using these representations .",
    "finally , in section [ seccook ] we reformulate our results recipe - style , the way they should be applied in calculations . despite all the tediousness of their derivation , we end up with two simple relations , which allow one to derive positive - p and positive - w representations for an arbitrary nonlinear quantum system .",
    "we illustrate their use by applying them to a number of systems common in quantum optics .",
    "the techniques we introduce in this paper are applicable to any hamiltonians which have a polynomial form in the field operators .",
    "we also assume that the hamiltonian can be divided into a quadratic part , called the free hamiltonian , and the remainder , termed the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "this allows us to introduce , in the usual manner , schrdinger , heisenberg , and interaction - picture field operators .",
    "however , this requirement may always be satisfied by subtracting a suitable quadratic term from the hamiltonian , and declaring the remainder as being the `` interaction '' part ( cf .  the way a higgs - type phase transition in an anharmonic oscillator was treated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this generality notwithstanding , our techniques may be effectively demonstrated for a 1d oscillator ( as is usual in quantum field theory ) .",
    "we therefore consider a nonlinear quantum oscillator with the hamiltonian , @xmath0using units such that @xmath1 . in ( [ eq : h ] ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the usual pair of creation and annihilation operators with commutator @xmath4=1 $ ] .",
    "they play the role of schrdinger - picture field operators for this illustrative system .",
    "the field operators in the interaction picture are simply @xmath5while heisenberg picture operators will be denoted in a slanted font as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "time ordering of operators puts operators from right to left in the order of _ increasing _ time arguments , e.g. , @xmath8for equal times , the time ordering is specified as normal ordering ( which places all creation operators on the left of annihilation operators ) .",
    "further , the reverse time ordering , @xmath9 , places operators in the order of _ decreasing _ time arguments .",
    "formally , it may be defined as a conjugate of @xmath10 : @xmath11% ^{\\dag }   , \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath12 is a product of field operators .",

    "quantities under ordering should be regarded as functions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , whereas ( [ eq : at ] ) may be used only after the time ordering has been completed . so calculating the time integral in ( [ eq : taa ] )",
    "should follow the ordering rather than precede it .",
    "were one to take the integral before the time ordering , it would prevent @xmath10 from acting on the operators comprising the interaction hamiltonian .      for our purposes",
    "we need relations applying to the whole assemblage of time - ordered operator products .",

    "( note that this is also the reason why the scrdinger - picture field operators were denoted @xmath39 , not @xmath40 . )",
    "a common way of dealing with time - ordered expressions is by converting them to normally ordered form .",
