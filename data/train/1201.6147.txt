    "r200pt    a photon linear collider ( plc ) has been considered as a possible option of the international linear collider ( ilc ) . in the plc ,",
    "high energy photons are generated by using inverse compton scattering between electrons and laser photons .",
    "an outline of plc is shown in figure [ fig : plc ] .",
    "details of plc are found in @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we investigated the feasibility of studying the self - coupling of higgs boson .",
    "the higgs self - coupling constant @xmath7 can be represented as @xmath8 which contributes via the diagram shown in figure [ fig : aahh ] to the higgs pair production in photon - photon collision .",
    "@xmath9 is the higgs boson self - coupling constant which is included in the standard model , and @xmath10 is the deviation from the standard model .",
    "theoretical studies have been performed for this process by several authors  @xcite",
    ". however , the cross - section of higgs self - coulping is very small , experimental feasibility against huge backgrounds is yet to be studied . in this study , we investigated feasibility to observe higgs pair production in high energy photon collision by monte - calro simulation using a realistic luminosity spectrum based on a set of plc parameters .",
    "in order to decide the optimum collision energy , we defined the statistical sensitivity for the @xmath10 as ; @xmath11 where , @xmath12 is the expected number of events as a function of @xmath10 , and @xmath13 is the expected number of events from the standard model . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the cross - section of higgs boson production as a function of @xmath10 and for the standard model .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the integrated luminosity , detection efficiency for signal , detection efficiency for background , and the cross - section of background processes , respectively . for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "the sensitivity is written as ; @xmath22    r160pt    figure [ fig : sensitivity ] shows the sensitivity plot as a function of the energy of @xmath0 interaction , @xmath23 , for the higgs boson mass of 120 gev/@xmath1 with integrated luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath24 .",
    "the cross - section of signal was calculated by using the formula given in @xcite for the case of @xmath25 as indicated in figure [ fig : sensitivity ] . from this result",
    ", we set @xmath26 gev for this study .",
    "the parameters for the electron and laser beams are chosen to maximize @xmath0 luminosity around @xmath26 gev based on tesla optimistic parameters  @xcite , where we assumed the same parameters with the tesla except for the electron beam energy ( table [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "the luminosity distribution for the parameters was simulated by cain  @xcite and is shown in figure [ fig : lumi ] .    cc    .luminosity distribution simulated by cain . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     captypefigure",
    "figure [ fig : process ] shows the cross - section for various @xmath0 and @xmath27 processes as a function of the center mass energy .",
    "it indicates that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes will be the main backgrounds at @xmath28 270 gev .",
    "since the main decay mode of the higgs boson of 120 gev/@xmath1 is @xmath29 ( branching ratio @xmath30 0.68 )  @xcite , we consentrated on the case of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 process is also considered as a background source .",
    "then we estimated the number of events by convoluting the luminosity distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ : @xmath32 we caluculated @xmath5 by using the formula in @xcite , @xmath2 by using helas  @xcite , @xmath3 by using gamgamzz - code  @xcite , and @xmath4 by using grace  @xcite .",
    "the numerical integration and event generation was performed by a monte - calro integration and event generation program bases / spring  @xcite .",
    "we expect 16 events / year for @xmath5 , @xmath33 events / year for @xmath2 , @xmath34 events / year for @xmath3 . for @xmath4 , @xmath35 events / year",
    "is expected for events with @xmath36 mass of grater than 15 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "jsf ( jlc study framework )  @xcite was used as the simulation framework in this study .",
    "pythia  @xcite was used for the parton shower and hadronization .",
    "a fast simulator  @xcite was used for the detector simulation instead of full simulation .",
    "we generated @xmath37 monte - calro events for @xmath5 , @xmath38 for @xmath2 , @xmath39 for @xmath3 , and @xmath39 for @xmath4 .",
    "first , we applied the forced 4-jet clustering to reconstruct the jets by using jade clustering algorithm  @xcite . in order to select proper combination of reconstructed jets , @xmath40s ( @xmath41 )",

    "which has the least @xmath40 was considered as the most probable combination .",
    "r170pt    in order to distinguish @xmath50 quarks , we used `` nsig '' method in this study .",
    "figure [ fig : nsig ] shows the outline of `` nsig '' method",
    ". for each charged track in a reconstruct jet , @xmath51 was calculated , where @xmath16 is the closest approach to the `` interaction point '' of the track in the plane perpendicular to the beam , and @xmath52 is its resolution .",
    "then @xmath53 , the number of tracks which have @xmath54 , is calculated for each jet .    before optimizing selection criteria",
    ", we applied the pre - selection :    * @xmath55 , * @xmath56 ,    where @xmath57 is the number of jets in which @xmath58 is greater than or equal to @xmath50 .",

    "jetnet  @xcite was used to train and to evaluate performance of the neural network .",
