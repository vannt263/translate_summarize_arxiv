    "it is now well known that many deterministic worst - case robust analysis and synthesis problems are np hard , which means that the exact analysis and synthesis of the corresponding robust control problems may be computational demanding @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the deterministic worst - case robustness measures may be quite conservative due to overbounding of the system uncertainties . as pointed out in @xcite by khargonekar and tikku ,",
    "the difficulties of deterministic worst - case robust control problems are inherent to the problem formulations and a major change of the paradigm is necessary .",
    "an alternative to the deterministic approach is the probabilistic approach which has been studied extensively by stengel and co - workers , see for example , @xcite , and references therein . aimed at breaking through the np - hardness barrier and reducing the conservativeness of the deterministic robustness measures , the probabilistic approach has recently received a renewed attention in the work by barmish and lagoa @xcite , barmish , lagoa , and tempo @xcite , barmish and polyak @xcite , khargonekar and tikku @xcite , bai , tempo , and fu @xcite , tempo , bai , and dabbene @xcite , yoon and khargonekar @xcite , zhu , huang and doyle @xcite , chen and zhou @xcite and references therein .",
    "in addition to its low computational complexity , the advantages of randomized algorithms can be found in the flexibility and adaptiveness in dealing with control analysis or synthesis problems with complicated constraints or in the situation of handling nonlinearities .",
    "the robust control analysis and synthesis problems under constraints are , in general , very hard to deal with in the deterministic framework . for example",
    ", it is well - known that a multi - objective control problem involving mixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 objectives are very hard to solve even though there are elegant solutions to the pure @xmath0 or @xmath1 problems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we first show that most of the robust control problems can be formulated as constrained optimal synthesis or robust analysis problems .",
    "since the exact robust analysis or synthesis is , in general , impossible , we seek a ` reliable ' solution by using randomized algorithms . roughly speaking , by ` reliability '",
    "we mean how the solution resulted by randomized algorithms approaches the exact one . in this paper , we measure the degree of ` reliability ' in terms of accuracy @xmath2 and confidence level @xmath3 . actually , terminologies like ` accuracy ' and ` confidence level ' have been used in @xcite and @xcite where accuracy @xmath2 is referred as an upper bound of the absolute _ volume _ of a subset of parameter space @xmath4 . however , in this paper , we emphasis that the accuracy @xmath2 is an upper bound for the _ ratio _ of _ volume _ of the _ constrained subset _",
    "@xmath5 with respect to the volume of parameter space @xmath4 .",
    "for example , when estimating the minimum of a quantity @xmath6 over @xmath7 the ratio may be @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an estimate resulted by randomized algorithms for quantity @xmath6 .",
    "we can see that the ratio of volume is a better indicator of the ` reliability ' than the absolute @xmath10 .",
    "based on this measure of ` reliability ' , we propose two different approaches aimed at seeking a solution to the robust analysis or optimal synthesis problem with a certain a priori specified degree of ` reliability ' .",
    "one is the * direct approach*. the key issue is to determine the number of samples needed to be generated from the parameter space @xmath4 for a given reliability measure .",
    "actually , khargonekar and tikku in @xcite have applied similar approach to stability margin problem , though the measure of ` reliability ' is in terms of the absolute volume . in that paper ,",
    "a sufficient condition is derived on the sample size required to come up with a ` reliable ' estimate of the robust stability margin ( see theorem 3.3 in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we also derive the bound of sample size and give the sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of minimum distribution - free samples size .",
    "our result shows that , the bound of sample size necessarily involves @xmath11 .",
    "thus estimating @xmath12 becomes essential .",
    "unfortunately , estimating @xmath12 is time - consuming and the resulted sample size is not accurate . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we propose and strongly advocate another approach  the * indirect approach*. the key issue is to determine the _ constrained sample size _ , which is the number of samples needed that fall into the constrained subset @xmath13 .",
    "we derive bounds of constrained sample size and give the sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of minimum distribution - free constrained samples size .",
    "the bounds do not involve @xmath12 and can be computed exactly .",
    "this result makes it possible to obtain a reliable solution without estimating the volume of the constrained parameter subset @xmath14 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the problem formulation and motivations . in section 3",
    ", we derive the exact distribution of related order statistics without the continuity assumption .",
    "distribution free tolerance interval and estimation of quantity range is discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 gives the minimum sample size under various assumptions .",
    "let @xmath15}^{t}$ ] be a vector of a control system s parameters , bounded in a compact set @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath16 . let @xmath17 be a set of constraints that @xmath18 must satisfy .",
    "define the _ constrained subset _ of @xmath4 by @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a performance index function .",
    "in many applications , we are concerned with a performance index function @xmath6 of the system under the set of constraints @xmath17 .",
    "it is natural to ask the following questions :    * what is @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) ? * what is the value of @xmath18 at which @xmath6 achieves @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) ?",
    "consider , for example , an uncertain system shown in figure  [ fig_a ] .",
    "denote the transfer function from @xmath24 to @xmath25 by @xmath26 and suppose that @xmath26 has the following state space realization @xmath27 .",
    "$ ] we can now consider several robustness problems :    * robust stability : let @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the @xmath31-th eigenvalue of @xmath32 .",
    "then the system is robustly stable if @xmath33 * stability margin : assume that @xmath34 belongs to the class of allowable perturbations @xmath35 which has a certain block structure . for a given real number @xmath36 , let @xmath37 denote the subset of perturbations in @xmath35 with size at most @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath38 the _ robustness measure _ @xmath39 is defined as the smallest allowable perturbation that destabilizes the feedback interconnection .",
    "let @xmath40 be an upper bound for @xmath39 .",
    "define parameter space @xmath4 by @xmath41 and constrained subset @xmath13 by @xmath42 let @xmath43 it follows that the stability margin problem is equivalent to computing @xmath44 * robust performance : suppose @xmath45 is stable for all @xmath16 .",
    "define @xmath46 then the robust performance problem is to determine if @xmath47 is satisfied for some prespecified @xmath48 . * performance range : let @xmath49 be a given set of parameters such that @xmath45 is stable for all @xmath50 . define again @xmath51 .",
    "then the problem of determining the range of the system s @xmath1 performance level can be formulated as finding @xmath52 .",

    "then we can formulate the problem as a constrained optimal synthesis problem by defining a performance index @xmath57 and restricting parameter @xmath18 to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is not too small for a stability margin .",
    "then the @xmath1 design problem is to determine a vector of parameters achieving @xmath60 .",
    "since the exact solution to the analysis or synthesis problem is impossible . measuring how the solution resulted by the randomized algorithm approaches",
