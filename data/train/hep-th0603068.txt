    "retrospecting recent progress in understanding various interesting effects in string theory , we are led to the desire of constructing a complete off - shell formulation of string theory . as will be explained below , at present there are two formulations for light - cone quantization of type iib closed superstring theory .",
    "however , neither of them is considered to be complete .",
    "one of the formulations is the light - cone superstring field theory ( lcsft ) @xcite constructed from supersymmetry algebra .",
    "the starting point is the green - schwarz action for free strings .",
    "we can construct the hamiltonian and the supercharges satisfying the supersymmetry algebra out of it .",
    "the interaction terms are added to these charges by requiring that the total charges satisfy the supersymmetry algebra perturbatively .",
    "the first order interaction term is given as @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the three - string interaction vertex constructed by the overlapping condition and @xmath2 @xmath3 is the holomorphic ( anti - holomorphic ) part of the bosonic momentum at the interaction point , whose divergence is regularized as follows : @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the interaction point .",
    "@xmath7 is the regularization of the fermionic momentum at the interaction point and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are known but intricate functions of @xmath7 .",
    "the program of constructing the interaction terms is successful at the first order , though it is too complicated to proceed to higher orders .",
    "the other formulation is matrix string theory ( mst ) @xcite , which stems from the matrix formulation of light - cone quantization of m - theory @xcite and takes the form of @xmath11-dimensional super yang - mills theory . to relate mst to the perturbative string",
    ", we first note that the yang - mills coupling @xmath12 is related to the string coupling @xmath13 and the string length @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the free string limit corresponds to the ir limit and the first order interaction term to the least irrelevant operator . from the requirement of the dimension counting and the locality of the interaction",
    ", we expect that the first order interaction term is written as dimension three operator constructed essentially out of the twist field .",
    "the interaction term of mst is proposed to be @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the excited twist field defined as @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the @xmath20 twist field and @xmath21 being the spin field for the green - schwarz fermions .",
    "the indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the twist fields denote the string bits where the `` exchange '' interaction takes place .",
    "these indices have to be summed over in calculating the string amplitude .",
    "the expression in mst seems somewhat formal compared with that in lcsft , though it is more promising to go beyond the first order in mst than in lcsft @xcite .",
    "hopefully we can obtain some information in lcsft from mst .",
    "for this purpose , we would like to relate lcsft to mst carefully . we can easily find a close analogy between and and between and , if we regard @xmath19 as @xmath1 and @xmath24 as @xmath25 . following this analogy between lcsft and mst , two supercharges of mst",
    "were written down explicitly in @xcite .",
    "these arguments of supercharges are consistent with the pioneering but primitive argument in @xcite and with the relation between lcsft and mst proposed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to proceed further to investigate the relation between the twist field @xmath19 and the three - string interaction vertex @xmath1 scrupulously .",
    "in particular , in addition to the defining ope of the excited twist field , we would like to realize the ope of two twist fields @xcite ( for each dimension ) @xmath26 in terms of the three - string interaction vertex @xmath1 . to realize the ope",
    ", we identify the interaction point @xmath6 of @xmath1 with the insertion point @xmath27 of the twist field @xmath19 .",
    "we multiply two string interaction vertices with a short intermediate time @xmath28 to see whether the effective interaction vertex reproduces the reflector ( which corresponds to the identity operator in cft ) with the suitable singularity .",
    "a natural question arises here . in lcsft",
    "the three - string interaction vertex @xmath1 is always accompanied by the level - matching projection @xmath29 on each string @xmath30 .",
    "we would like to see which one corresponds to the twist field ; the interaction vertex with projections , @xmath31 , or the vertex without them , @xmath1 .",
    "our answer to this question is as follows . to calculate the amplitude in lcsft",
    ", we need to integrate over the intermediate string length ( @xmath5 ) and perform the level - matching projection at each string .",
    "the level - matching projection is equivalent to integrating over the diagrams by shifting the interaction point by an angle .",
    "these two integrations are combined into a simple summation over string bits @xmath22 and @xmath23 in . since",
    "the twist field by itself is the expression before the summations , the corresponding interaction vertex in lcsft should not contain any summations .",
    "hence , the interaction vertex corresponding to the twist field is the one @xmath1 without the level - matching projection and the intermediate string length integration .",
    "there are two ways to realize because the interaction vertices can be connected in two different ways .",
    "one of them is the four - point tree diagram connecting the long string of two interaction vertices ( fig .  [ fig:4string ] ) and",
    "the other is the two - point 1-loop diagram connecting two short strings ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2string ] ) .",
    "we shall evaluate these two diagrams in the next section to see that both of the results are proportional to the reflector with the same singularity as that in .",
    "note that it is desirable to perform all the computations of the above diagrams in the superstring theory , if we want to relate lcsft to mst .",
    "however , here we shall utilize the bosonic string theory for simplicity @xcite .",
    "it should not be too difficult to generalize our computation to the supersymmetric case . also note that the separation of the two interaction points in the above diagrams is in the worldsheet time direction , while we separate two insertion points in the space direction in . since ope does not depend on in which direction one operator approaches the other , we assume that the results do not depend on the directions .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall first recapitulate some necessary ingredients of lcsft .",
    "the first subsection is devoted to the computation of the tree diagram and in the second and third subsections we compute the 1-loop diagram .",
    "finally , we conclude with some further directions .",
    "a short review of neumann coefficients is given in appendix a. a somewhat related result about free field realization of boundary changing operators is given in appendix b.",
    "in this section , we would like to evaluate the two diagrams mentioned in the introduction to see the correspondence between the twist field @xmath19 and the interaction vertex @xmath1 .",
    "for this purpose , let us briefly review the closed lcsft here .",

    "let us regularize the size of the infinitely - dimensional neumann matrices by truncating it at a finite level .",
    "due to the expression of the mode expansion , the uv cutoff of the worldsheet @xmath49 of string @xmath50 is related to the truncation level @xmath51 by @xmath52 .",
    "if we fix the uv cutoff of the worldsheet to a constant and choose string 3 to be the long string , @xmath53 , the truncation levels of three strings have to be related by @xmath54 . in this sense @xmath55",
    "is a square matrix . ]",
    "@xmath56 which play important roles in our later computation .",
