    "it is well recognized that entanglement entropy is a useful tool to characterize a quantum state  @xcite .",
    "historically , quantum entanglement has been one of the most mysterious and fascinating features of quantum mechanics in that performing a local measurement may instantaneously affect the outcome of local measurements beyond the lightcone .",
    "this apparent violation of causality is known as the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox  @xcite . however , since information does not get transferred in such a measurement , causality remains intact .",
    "there are many phenomena which we are now finding that quantum entanglement may play a role , including bubble nucleation  @xcite .",
    "schwinger pair production in a constant electric field can be considered as an analogue of bubble nucleation in a false vacuum . in the case of pair creation ,",
    "electron - positron pairs are spontaneously created with a certain separation and such particle states should then be quantum correlated .",
    "recent studies of the schwinger effect infer that observer frames will be strongly correlated to each other when they observe the nucleation frame  @xcite .",
    "entanglement entropy has now been established as a suitable measure of the degree of entanglement of a quantum system .",
    "entanglement entropy has since become a useful tool in understanding phenomena in condensed matter physics , quantum information and high energy physics .",
    "for example , entanglement entropy plays the roll of an order parameter in condensed matter systems and thus the phase structure can be examined using this measure of quantum correlation .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the consequences of a measurable entanglement entropy in a cosmological setting , especially in view of the bubble nucleation and the multiverse .",
    "indeed , it may be possible to investigate whether a universe entangled with our own universe exists within the multiverse framework .",
    "such a scenario may be observable through the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .    to calculate the entanglement entropy in quantum field theories explicitly has , until recently , not been an easy task . in @xcite , ryu and takayanagi",
    "proposed a method of calculating the entanglement entropy of a strongly coupled quantum field theory with a gravity dual using holographic techniques .",
    "this has proved extremely powerful and their formula has passed many consistency checks  @xcite . consequently , entanglement entropy , especially within a holographic context has been attracting a great deal of attention of late .    in  @xcite maldacena and pimentel developed a method to explicitly calculate the entanglement entropy in a quantum field theory in the bunch - davies vacuum of de sitter space and discussed the gravitational dual of this theory and its holographic interpretation . in this paper",
    ", we extend the calculation of the entanglement entropy in the bunch - davies vacuum to @xmath0-vacua .",
    "the use of conformal symmetry of the de sitter invariant bunch - davies vacuum as utilized by maldacena and pimental can be also extended to the @xmath0-vacua and this will significantly simplify the calculation .    our interest in @xmath0-vacua is three - fold : firstly , these new examples serve to further develop our understanding of the nature of entanglement entropy in the non - trivial vacua with de sitter invariance .",
    "second , understanding entanglement entropy in this de sitter invariant family of backgrounds will provide a non - trivial check of the holographic methods employed by ryu and takayanagi which even today is the only tool at our disposal to access the entanglement entropy of strongly - coupled quantum field theories .",
    "we would like to clarify here how the change of the vacuum can be implemented into the holographic scheme .",
    "this is related to the issue of how to describe the entanglement entropy of excited states from the holographic point of view .",
    "our final motivation stems from cosmology . in conjunction with cmb observations ,",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that non - bunch - davies vacua are preferable to explain the results of bicep2  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field in the family of @xmath0-vacua in a fixed de sitter background .",
    "note that this is not the entropy of the metric on the de sitter horizon which has already been discussed extensively in the literature  @xcite@xcite .",
    "intuitively , an @xmath0-vacuum can be thought of as a state of pair condensation or , alternatively , as a squeezed state  @xcite .",
    "thus the quantum uncertainty of the state is heavily constrained .",
    "the pair condensation itself has an intrinsic quantum correlation associated with it . when the rate of pair condensation increases , it is expected that the quantum correlation would increase .",
    "hence , we expect an increase of the entanglement entropy with increasing @xmath0 parameter , corresponding to the increased pair condensation .",
    "we are also able to investigate the rnyi entropy using the same mathematical techniques .",
    "this will gives rise to a new measure of quantum correlation in these vacua and we will explore the @xmath0 dependence .",
    "we try to give a holographic interpretation in the discussion , however , we find it difficult to implement the change of the vacuum in a conventional manner .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the method developed by maldacena and pimentel with some comments relevant to the calculation of the entanglement entropy of @xmath0-vacua . in section 3 , we introduce the @xmath0-vacua and calculate the relevant density matrix and the entanglement entropy .",
    "we also evaluate the rnyi entropy .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with some summary remarks and speculation about a possible holographic interpretation of our results .",
    "in @xcite , maldacena and pimentel developed a method to calculate a specific contribution to the entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field in de sitter space explicitly .",
    "they showed that the long range correlations implied by the entanglement entropy are maximal for small masses and decay exponentially as the mass increases . here",
    "we will review the formalism developed in that paper before extending it to @xmath0-vacua in section [ sec : alpha ] .",
    "the entanglement entropy is a quantity which characterizes quantum correlations of a system . in particular",
    "it is the long - range correlations in which we will be interested .",
    "it can be thought of as a measure of how much we can discover about the full state of a system , given only a subsystem of it to measure .",
    "to explain this , let us divide the system into two subsystems @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the hilbert space becomes a direct product @xmath5 . as an illustration",
    ", we choose a special state @xmath6 is the amplitude of finding the @xmath7-th state . in this case , the density matrix is @xmath8 if we trace over the degrees of freedom of @xmath4 , we find that the density matrix of the subsystem @xmath3 is given by @xmath9 and the density matrix is normalized to 1 because of the conservation of probability @xmath10 however , @xmath11 in general .",
    "the entanglement entropy is defined via the density matrix as the von - neumann entropy @xmath12 where we traced over the subsystem @xmath3 . for a pure state such as @xmath13 ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is given by @xmath14 .",
    "for a mixed state such as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the dimensionality of the correlated hilbert space , the entanglement entropy takes the maximum value @xmath17 since the number @xmath16 describes the extent to which the system correlates , the entanglement entropy is certainly a measure of the quantum correlations . in other words ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is related to the relevant degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "for instance , in a two dimensional conformal field theory the entanglement entropy is proportional to the central charge which counts the degrees of freedom in such a system  @xcite .      in order to study entanglement entropy in @xmath18-dimensional de sitter space",
    "we consider a closed surface @xmath19 in a hypersurface at fixed time .",
    "this divides the spacelike hypersurface into an inside region ( @xmath3 ) and an outside region ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the total hilbert space , as in the previous section can then be written as a direct product @xmath20 . from this",
    "we can trace over the outside region to construct the density matrix for the internal region @xmath21 . from this",
    "we can then obtain the entanglement entropy defined in eq .",

    "the uv - finite part contains information about the long - range correlations of the quantum state in de sitter space .",

    "the @xmath0-vacua can be thought of as a state filled with pair of particles from the point of view of the bunch - davies vacuum . in order to obtain the entanglement entropy",

    "this can be done when the density matrix is diagonal . to make the density matrix diagonal , it is essential to transform the original matrix into a special form .",
    "this can be done for the bunch - davies vacuum . in the case of @xmath0-vacua",
    "it is not so straightforward to obtain diagonal density matrix .",
    "however , we found a formula which can be used to obtain the entanglement entropy .",
    "we find that the entanglement entropy in de sitter space takes the minimal value for the bunch - davies vacuum among the @xmath0-vacua .",
    "we argue these features stem from the pair condensation of @xmath0-vacua where the pair has the intrinsic quantum correlation .",
    "we also calculated the rnyi entropy and showed that the asymptotic value of the rnyi entropy increases exponentially as @xmath0 increases .    in terms of future extensions of this work ,",
    "one of the most pressing would be a holographic interpretation along the lines of the work of maldacena and pimentel for the bunch - davies vacuum in @xcite . to summarize their argument ; a free field theory on a curved de sitter space @xmath191\\ , .",
    "\\label{5ads2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be investigated in a holographic context by treating the de sitter space as the boundary of an anti - de sitter ( ads ) bulk which can then be considered as the gravitational dual  @xcite@xcite . here , @xmath45 is the metric of a two - sphere and @xmath192 are a radial , a time , and an angular coordinate , respectively",
    ". then , following ryu and takayanagi @xcite , they match the field theory computation of the entanglement entropy to the area of an appropriate minimal surface in the ads space .",
    "the minimal surface is identified as the surface @xmath193 constant and @xmath194 . starting with",
    "a conformally coupled scalar ( @xmath195 ) , they generalize the model to non - conformal theories in this holographic scheme .",
    "then , the bulk geometry is modified as @xmath196 where @xmath197 is a four - dimensional de sitter metric and the function @xmath198 is determined by solving the einstein equation with the scalar field .",
    "the surface we should take is the one at @xmath194 , @xmath199 which extremizes the area @xmath200 where @xmath201 is two - volume .",
    "it would be of great interest to understand how this line of reasoning is modified for @xmath0-vacua .",
    "the first hurdle to such a holographic computation of the entanglement entropy of the @xmath0-vacua in a strongly coupled phase is the lack of clarity as to what precisely the gravity duals of a field theory on such @xmath0 backgrounds are beyond the fact that they will likely be some one - parameter deformation of ads .",
    "nevertheless , having demonstrated that at @xmath130 the entanglement entropy is @xmath0-independent , we believe that in this case , the maldacena - pimentel argument should go through essentially unchanged since the latter does not require a choice of vacuum .",
    "more generally though , as we saw above , the entanglement entropy of @xmath0-vacua is decidedly different from that of the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "hence , we expect the three - dimensional area at @xmath194 , @xmath199 in the ads bulk must be further deformed to match the entanglement entropy . however , it is not clear how to implement this state dependence in to the holographic scheme . in the conventional case ,",
    "the boundary geometry is minkowski space where we do not have vacuum ambiguity . now that there is a continuum of vacua in de sitter space , we are not sure what surface corresponds to each vacuum .",
    "a naive answer is that because there is a difficulty in defining an interacting field theory on an @xmath0-vacuum  @xcite the holographic principle may not lead to a well - defined gravitational theory .",
    "we leave these considerations for future investigation .",
