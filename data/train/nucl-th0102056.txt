    "the behavior of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature is the subject of the research programs at cern ( sps ) and brookhaven ( ags and rhic ) .",
    "hydrodynamical and thermal models have been used extensively to describe data from these collisions and the following picture has emerged ( see e.g. @xcite ) from a study of collisions at sis , ags , sps energies , with a variety of targets and projectiles ( for a compilation see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is also expected to hold at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the dense and hot fluid expands and cools until chemical freeze - out occurs for some species of particles .",
    "namely these particles stop having inelastic collisions so that their abundances are frozen .",
    "therefore by studying the abundances of these chemically frozen particle species , one learn the conditions at chemical freeze - out .",
    "for example , at cern , @xmath4 mev @xcite .",
    "the fluid goes on cooling until thermal freeze - out happens .",
    "precisely , particles stop having elastic interactions and so the shape of their momentum distribution is fixed .",
    "therefore by studying these spectra , one gets information about the conditions at thermal freeze - out .",
    "for example at cern , using various types of particles @xcite or combining information about the spectrum of a single particle species and its bose - einstein correlations @xcite , one extracts @xmath1 mev .",
    "there are some deviations to this picture .",
    "for example , some particles like the @xmath5 may undergo both freeze - outs almost together and early ( due to their small cross section ) .",
    "though this picture is simple and consistent with data , its theoretical justification needs further scrutiny .",
    "first , in a way , this picture works too well as a statistical description seems to apply even to very elementary systems @xcite .",
    "this has been debated a lot yet remains an open question .",
    "second , in this description , it is assumed that particles make _ sudden _ freeze - outs .",
    "for example , when they cross the 180 mev temperature three - dimensional surface in the fluid they immediately stop interacting inelastically . in reality one",
    "expects that this should happen over a certain length .",
    "a formalism to account for finite freeze - out volumes and the subsequent new data interpretation have been presented in @xcite .",
    "third , in the freeze - out scenario , when computing particle distribution with the usual cooper - frye formula @xcite , there may be particles contributing negatively , corresponding to particles that are in the frozen out region and re - entering the interacting region . physically this should not happen but in the calculation , it may .",
    "ways to deal with this problem and how it affects particle data interpretation can be found in @xcite .",
    "leaving aside these problems for further studies , the objective of this paper is the following . in the past ,",
    "cascade event generators ( fritiof , venus , rqmd , arc , etc ) were employed in particular by experimental groups , to study their data .",
    "recently , simple thermal and hydrodynamics - inspired models have been used increasingly .",
    "it seems useful therefore to start developing more sophisticated hydrodynamical codes @xcite to extract physical information from data .",
    "though data call for separate chemical and thermal freeze outs , no hydrodynamical code so far includes chemical and thermal freeze outs self - consistently .",
    "namely , the effect of the early chemical freeze out on the fluid expansion is never taken into account . in this paper",
    ", we discuss how to incorporate separate chemical and thermal freeze - outs in a hydrodynamical code and show that in certain cases , this will have sizable impact on the predicted values of observables .    finally let us mention that early universe and relativistic heavy ion collisions call for different treatments for the following reason . in the early universe ,",
    "the expansion rate ( @xmath6 ) at the qcd phase transition is many orders of magnitude smaller than for relativistic heavy ion collisions ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "in both cases , a typical reaction rate for hadrons is @xmath8 .",
    "therefore while in the early universe , chemical and thermal equilibrium betweeen hadrons must have prevailed ( @xmath9 ) , this is not the case for relativistic heavy ion collisions ( @xmath10 may be @xmath11 ) . moreover in relativistic heavy ion collisions , we expect separate chemical and thermal freeze - outs ( i.e. at distinct temperatures ) because inelastic collisions ( responsible for chemical equilibrium ) need higher center of mass energy to be operative in general , compared to elastic collisions ( responsible for thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "this distinction needs not be made in the early universe ( both rates @xmath12 and @xmath13 being much larger than the expansion rate ) .",
    "to simplify the discussion , we use a known and simple hydrodynamical model , bjorken one - dimensional boost invariant model@xcite . before chemical freeze - out ,",
    "the fluid evolution is governed by the hydrodynamical equations @xmath14 the last equation can be solved easily @xmath15 the first equation must be completed by the choice of an equation of state @xmath16 , for the pressure as function of the net baryon density and energy density .    also to simplify the discussion , we suppose that chemical or thermal freeze - out occurs at some fixed temperature ( as often assumed in the analysis of experimental data ) .",
    "attempts to incorporate more physical freeze - out conditions have been carried out @xcite and in principle might be incorporated in the scheme described below .    when the fluid temperature has decreased to some temperature @xmath2 , ( which corresponds to a certain time @xmath17 ) ,",
    "some particle species get their abundances frozen . to fix ideas",
    ", we suppose that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are in this situation . then in addition to the above hydrodynamical equations , we introduce separate conservation laws for these two types of particles for time @xmath20 , namely @xmath21 these equations have solutions of the same form as ( 3 ) but with @xmath22 substituted by @xmath23 . therefore what remains to be done is to solve the energy - momentum equation ( 1 ) with a _ modified equation of state _ , to account for the particles who make an early chemical freeze - out .",
    "we suppose that the fluid is a gas of non - interacting resonances",
    ". then for particle species @xmath24 , using an expansion in term of modified bessel functions @xcite to allow the study of their limit more easily in ( 9 - 11 ) , @xmath25 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_i   & = & \\frac{g_i m_i^2 t^2}{2 \\pi^2 } \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } ( \\mp)^{n+1 } \\frac{e^{n \\mu_i / t}}{n^2 } k_2(n m_i / t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the particle mass , @xmath27 , its degeneracy and @xmath28 , its chemical potential , the minus sign holds for fermions and plus for bosons . in principle",
    "each particle species @xmath24 making early chemical freeze - out has a chemical potential associated to it ; this potential controls the conservation of the number of particles of type @xmath24 . for particle species not making early chemical freeze - out ,",
    "the chemical potential is of the usual type , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) ensures the conservation of baryon number ( strangeness ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the baryon ( strangeness ) number of particle of type @xmath24 .",
    "so the modified equation of state depends not only on @xmath34 and @xmath35 but also @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "( the notation `` @xmath38 '' stands for all the other particles making early chemical freeze - out ) @xcite .",
    "this complicates the hydrodynamical problem , however we can note the following .    if @xmath39 ( the density of type @xmath24 particle is low ) and @xmath40 , ( these relations should hold for all particles except pions and we checked them for various times and particle types ) the following approximations can be used @xmath41 we note that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are written in term of @xmath44 and t. therefore we can work with the variables @xmath45 , rather than @xmath46 . the time dependence of @xmath47 is known as discussed already .",
    "so the modified equation of state can be computed from @xmath48 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the scheme presented above can easily be generalized to particles making chemical freeze - out at different times ( using different @xmath17 ) and particles doing chemical and thermal freeze - outs together ( whose contribution drop out of the equation of state ) .",
    "one can show that entropy is conserved even in the presence of an early chemical freeze - out when the hydrodynamical equations are satisfied by a perfect fluid @xcite .    for illustration , we present results using in the equation of state , the basic multiplets of resonances ( pseudoscalar meson octet plus singlet , vector meson octet plus singlet , baryon octet and baryon decuplet ) and supposing that the early chemical freeze - out occurs at 180 mev , a value typical for sps energy more or less independently of the projectile @xcite .",
    "we use for initial conditions @xmath49 mev , @xmath50 fm , so that @xmath51 mev , which is in agreement with results for s or pb at sps @xcite .",
    "in figure 1 , we compare the behavior of @xmath34 and @xmath35 as function of @xmath48 , obtained from the hydrodynamical equations using the modified equation of state and the unmodified one . for the modified equation of state",
    ", we considered two scenarios : ( i ) all strange particle in the basic multiplets , ( ii ) all strange particles except @xmath52 and @xmath53 s , make an early chemical freeze - out .",
    "this is a conservative estimate , it is possible for example that the pions make an early freeze - out @xcite .",
    "comparing scenarios i and ii , we note that if more particles undergo early chemical freeze - out , stronger effects for @xmath54 and @xmath55 are seen .",
    "we concentrate on i thereon .",
    "we see that the deviations between i and the unmodified equation of state case increase with time . in particular from this figure ,",
    "if the thermal freeze - out occurs at 110 mev , the thermal freeze - out time is 13 fm for the modified equation of state and 20 fm for the unmodified one ; the corresponding baryonic potentials are not very different , 405 and 375 mev respectively .",
    "if the thermal freeze - out occurs earlier , say at 140 mev , the difference in the thermal freeze - out times would be much less .",
    "an immediate consequence of this , is that the thermal freeze - out volume ( in our case simply proportional to time ) may be much smaller for the modified equation of state .",
    "we expect this conclusion to hold qualitatively even in the presence of transverse expansion : in this case , expansion is faster and the thermal freeze - out temperature is reached faster , so the thermal freeze - out times for the modified and unmodified equation of state are less different , however there is a competing effect for the thermal freeze - out volumes , they now scale with higher powers of time .",
    "we also expect this conclusion to hold at rhic energies , with @xmath56 still of order 180 mev ( it can not be much higher since a transition to quark - gluon plasma is expected at about this temperature from lattice gauge simulations ) but a lower value of @xmath57 ( less baryon stopping is expected at rhic than sps ) , the value of @xmath58 may be a little smaller than at sps @xcite and @xmath59 will be higher than @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) .",
    "_ we conclude that if the chemical and thermal freeze - out temperatures are very different _ ( in our simplified case , 180 and 110 mev ) _ or if many particle species make an early chemical freeze out _",
    "( e.g. also pions ) , _ it is important to take into account the effect of the early chemical freeze - out on the equation of state _ to make predictions for observables which depend on thermal freeze - out volumes , for example particle abundances and eventually particle correlations .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "if the chemical and thermal freeze - out temperatures are not very different ( say 180 and 140 mev ) , or if few particle species make the early freeze out , one can proceed as follows .",
    "one can use an unmodified equation of state in a hydrodynamical code and to account for early chemical freeze - out of species @xmath24 , when the number of type @xmath24 particles was fixed , use a modified cooper - frye formula @xmath61 the second factor on the right hand side is the usual one and it gives the shape of the spectrum at thermal freeze - out , the first factor is a normalizing term introduced such that upon integration on momentum @xmath62 , the number of particles of type @xmath24 is @xmath63 . for illustration , we show results obtained with the hydrodynamical model , hylander - plus @xcite .",
    "it provides a numerical solution of the relativistic hydrodynamical equations in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions with axial symmetry ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "it gives a good description of single - particle - rapidity data , transverse - momentum spectra of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath62 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and pion correlation data at cern energies , for an appropriate choice of the initial conditions , an equation of state incorporating a first order phase transition and a freeze - out temperature of 139 mev . in figures 2 and 3 , we show results obtained for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 respectively ( neglecting resonance decays ) and data@xcite .",
    "we see that both their shapes and abundances can be reproduced for @xmath71 mev and @xmath72 mev , while simultaneous freeze - outs at @xmath73 mev would yield the correct shapes but too few particles .",
    "therefore , results with hylander - plus and a modified cooper - frye formula ( 12 ) support the separate freeze - outs picture . however in this code , @xmath3 is fixed to 139 mev while as already mentioned , some data seem to imply lower thermal freeze - out temperatures . in the next generation of hydrodynamical codes , it is desirable to consider a wider range of @xmath3 .",
    "in summary , we showed how to incorporate separate chemical and thermal freeze - outs in a hydrodynamical code via a modified equation of state in section ii ( general case ) or via a modified cooper - frye formula in section iii ( particular case of @xmath2 close to @xmath3 or few particle species undergoing early chemical freeze - out ) .",
    "the modified equation of state causes faster cooling and may have sizable impact on the predicted values of observables .",
