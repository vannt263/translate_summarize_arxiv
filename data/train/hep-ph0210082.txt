    "in recent years , significant attention was dedicated to exploring properties of heavy - flavor hadrons produced in lepton - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . on the experimental side ,",
    "the hadron - electron ring accelerator ( hera ) at desy has generated a large amount of data on the production of charmed @xcite and bottom mesons @xcite . at present energies ( of order 300 gev in the @xmath1 center - of - mass frame ) , a substantial charm production cross section is observed in a wide range of bjorken @xmath2 and photon virtualities @xmath3 , and charm quarks contribute up to 30% to the dis structure functions .",
    "on the theory side , perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) provides a natural framework for the description of heavy - flavor production . due to the large masses @xmath4 of the charm and bottom quarks ( @xmath5 )",
    ", the renormalization scale can be always chosen in a region where the effective qcd coupling @xmath6 is small . despite the smallness of @xmath6 , perturbative calculations in the presence of heavy flavors are not without intricacies .",
    "in particular , care in the choice of a factorization scheme is essential for the efficient separation of the short- and long - distance contributions to the heavy - quark cross section .",
    "this choice depends on the value of @xmath0 as compared to the heavy quark mass @xmath4 .",
    "the key issue here is whether , for a given renormalization and factorization scale @xmath7 , the heavy quarks of the @xmath8-th flavor are treated as _",
    "partons _ in the incoming proton , _",
    "i.e. _ , whether one calculates the qcd beta - function using @xmath8 active quark flavors and introduces a parton distribution function ( pdf ) for the @xmath8-th flavor . a related , but separate , issue is whether the mass of the heavy quark can be neglected in the hard cross section without ruining the accuracy of the calculation .    currently , several factorization schemes are available that provide different approaches to the treatment of these issues . among the mass - retaining factorization schemes",
    ", we would like to single out the fixed flavor number factorization scheme ( ffn scheme ) , which includes the heavy - quark contributions exclusively in the hard cross section @xcite ; and massive variable flavor number schemes ( vfn schemes ) , which introduce the pdfs for the heavy quarks and change the number of active flavors by one unit when a heavy quark threshold is crossed @xcite .",
    "further details on these schemes can be found later in the paper .",
    "here we would like to point out that , were the calculation done to all orders of @xmath6 , the ffn and massive vfn schemes would be exactly equivalent .",
    "however , in a finite - order calculation the perturbative series in one scheme may converge faster than that in the other scheme .",
    "in particular , the ffn scheme presents the most economic way to organize the perturbative calculation near the heavy quark threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath9 . at the same time",
    ", it becomes inappropriate at @xmath10 due to powers of large logarithms @xmath11 in the hard cross section . in the vfn schemes",
    ", these logarithms are summed through all orders in the heavy - quark pdf with the help of the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equation @xcite ; hence the perturbative convergence in the high - energy limit is preserved . in their turn",
    ", the vfn schemes may converge slower at @xmath9 , mostly because of the violation of energy conservation in the heavy - quark pdf s in that region .",
    "recently an optimal vfn scheme was proposed that compensates for this effect @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to concentrate on the analysis of semi - inclusive differential distributions ( _ i.e. _ , distributions depending on additional kinematical variables besides @xmath2 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "we will argue that finite - order calculations in any factorization scheme do not satisfactorily describe such distributions due to additional large logarithms besides the logarithms @xmath12 . to obtain stable predictions ,",
    "all - order summation of these extra logarithmic terms is necessary .",
    "the extra logarithms are of the form @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the transverse momentum @xmath16 of the heavy hadron in the @xmath17 center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "reference frame rescaled by the variable @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the momenta of the initial - state proton , virtual photon , and heavy hadron , respectively .",
    "our definitions for the @xmath17 c.m .  frame and hadron momenta",
    "are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : gammap ] .",
    "the resummation of these logarithms is needed when the final - state hadron escapes in the current fragmentation region ( _ i.e. _ , close the direction of the virtual photon in the @xmath17 c.m .",
    "frame , where the rate is the largest ) . in the current fragmentation region ,",
    "the ratio @xmath21 is small ; therefore , the terms @xmath22 compensate for the smallness of @xmath6 at each order of the perturbative expansion .",
    "if hadronic masses are neglected , such logarithms can be summed through all orders in the impact parameter space resummation formalism @xcite , which was originally introduced to describe angular correlations in @xmath23 hadroproduction @xcite and transverse momentum distributions in the drell - yan process @xcite . here",
    "the impact parameter @xmath24 is conjugate to @xmath25 .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite are immediately valid for semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) production of light hadrons ( @xmath26 ) at @xmath0 of a few gev or higher , and for semi - inclusive heavy quark production at @xmath10 . to describe heavy - flavor production at @xmath27",
    ", the massless @xmath25-resummation formalism must be extended to include the dependence on the heavy - quark mass @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    ", we perform such extension in the aivazis - collins - olness - tung ( acot ) massive vfn scheme threshold region @xcite .",
    "we adopt a `` bottom - up '' approach to the development of such mass - dependent resummation ..",
    "such analysis could involve methods similar to those discussed in ref .",
    "] we start by separately reviewing the massive vfn scheme in the inclusive dis and @xmath25 resummation in the massless sidis .",
    "we then discuss a combination of these two frameworks in a joint resummation of the logarithms @xmath12 and @xmath28 ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain a unified description of fully differential heavy - hadron distributions at all @xmath3 above the heavy quark threshold .",
    "it is well known that the finite - order calculation does not satisfactorily treat the current fragmentation region for any choice of the factorization scheme .",
    "in contrast , the proposed massive extension of the @xmath25-resummation accurately describes the current fragmentation region in the whole range @xmath29 .",
    "the present study is interesting for two phenomenological reasons .",
    "firstly , the quality of the differential data will improve greatly within the next few years . by 2006",
    ", the upgraded collider hera will accumulate an integrated luminosity of @xmath30 @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , more than eight times the final integrated luminosity from its previous runs . studies of the heavy quarks in dis are also envisioned at the proposed high - luminosity electron ion collider @xcite and thera @xcite .",
    "eventually these experiments will present detailed distributions both at small ( @xmath9 ) and large ( @xmath10 ) momentum transfers .",
    "secondly , the knowledge of the differential distributions is essential for the accurate reconstruction of inclusive observables , such as the charm component of the structure function @xmath31 . at hera ,    as an example , we apply the developed method to the leading - order flavor - creation and flavor - excitation processes in the production of bottom mesons at hera . we find that the resummed cross section for this process can be described purely by means of perturbation theory due to the large mass of the bottom quark .",
    "our predictions can be tested in the next few years once the integrated luminosity at hera approaches @xmath32 essentially the same method can be applied to charm production . in that case , however , the resummed cross section is sensitive to the nonperturbative large-@xmath24 contributions due to the smaller mass of the charm quarks , and the analysis is more involved . since the goal of this paper is to discuss the basic principles of the massive @xmath25-resummation , we leave the study of the charm production and other phenomenological aspects for future publications .",
    "the paper has the following structure .",
    "section [ sec : acot ] reviews the application of the acot factorization scheme @xcite and its simplified version @xcite to the description of the inclusive dis structure functions .",
    "section [ sec : css ] recaps basic features of the @xmath24-space resummation formalism _ _ _ _ in _ massless _ sidis .",
    "section [ sec : massivecss ] discusses modifications in the resummed cross section to incorporate the dependence on the heavy - quark mass @xmath4 . in section  [ sec : photongluon ] , we present a detailed calculation of the mass - dependent resummed cross sections in the leading - order flavor - creation and flavor - excitation processes .",
    "section [ sec : numericalresults ] presents numerical results for polar angle distributions in the production of bottom quarks at hera .",
    "appendix  [ appendix : chg ] contains details on the calculation of the @xmath33 mass - dependent part of the resummed cross section . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : fo ] , we present explicit expressions for the @xmath33 finite - order contributions from the photon - gluon channel .",
    "finally , appendix  [ appendix : kinematicalcorrection ] discusses in detail the optimization of the acot scheme when it is applied to the differential distributions in the vicinity of the threshold region .",
    "in this section , we discuss the application of the aivazis - collins - olness - tung ( acot ) factorization scheme @xcite to inclusive dis observables , for which this scheme yields accurate predictions both at asymptotically high energies and near the heavy - quark threshold .    in the inclusive dis",
    ", the factorization in the presence of heavy flavors is established by a factorization theorem @xcite , which we review under a simplifying assumption that only one heavy flavor @xmath34 with the mass @xmath4 is present .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the incident hadron . according to the theorem ,",
    "the contribution @xmath36 of @xmath34 to a dis structure function @xmath37 ( where @xmath37 is one of the functions @xmath38 or @xmath31 in parity - conserving dis ) can be written as @xmath39 here the summation over the internal index @xmath40 includes both light partons ( gluons @xmath41 and light quarks ) , as well as the heavy quark @xmath34 .",
    "this representation is accurate up to the non - factorizable terms that do not depend on @xmath4 and can be ignored when @xmath42 . the non - vanishing term on the r.h.s .",
    "is written as a convolution integral of parton distribution functions @xmath43 and coefficient functions @xmath44 .",
    "the convolution is realized over the hadron light - cone momentum fraction @xmath45 carried by the parton @xmath40 .",
    "the coefficient function depends on the flavor - dependent `` scaling variable '' @xmath46 discussed below . the parton distributions and coefficient functions",

    "are included either in @xmath50 or @xmath48 depending on the factorization scheme in use .    in the reference frame where the momentum of the incident hadron @xmath35 in the light - cone coordinates is @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 )",
    ", the quark pdf can be defined in terms of the quark field operators @xmath57 as @xcite @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the path - ordered exponential of the gluon field @xmath60 in the gauge @xmath61 .",
    "the r.h.s .",
    "is averaged over the spin and color of @xmath35 and summed over the spin and color of @xmath62 . a similar definition exists for the gluon pdf .",
    "the dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath47 is induced in the process of renormalization of ultraviolet ( uv ) singularities that appear in the bilocal operator on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) . in general ,",
    "the pdf is a nonperturbative object ; however , it can be calculated in pqcd when @xmath64 , and the incident hadron @xmath35 is replaced by a parton .",
    "this feature opens the door for the calculation of @xmath36 for any hadron @xmath35 through the conventional sequence of calculating @xmath65 in parton - level dis and convolving it with the phenomenological parameterization of the nonperturbative pdf @xmath63 . in the inclusive dis , it is convenient to choose @xmath7 to avoid the appearance of the large logarithm @xmath66 in @xmath65 .",
    "the factorized representation ( [ f ] ) is valid in all factorization schemes .",
    "the specific factorization scheme is determined by ( a ) the procedure for the renormalization of the uv singularities ; and",
    "( b ) the prescription for keeping or discarding terms with positive powers of @xmath67 in the coefficient function @xmath50 .",
    "the choice ( a ) determines if the logarithms @xmath54 are resummed in the heavy - flavor pdf or not . with respect to each of two issues",
    ", the choice can be done independently .",
    "for instance , the @xmath68 factorization scheme uses the dimensional regularization to handle the uv singularities , but does not uniquely determine the choice ( b ) .",
    "hence , it is not necessary in this scheme to always neglect @xmath4 in the coefficient function and expose the heavy - quark mass singularities as poles in the dimensional regularization .",
    "the acot scheme belongs to the class of the variable flavor number ( vfn ) factorization schemes  @xcite that change the renormalization prescription when @xmath47 crosses a threshold value @xmath69 .",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath69 for the flavor @xmath34 to be equal to @xmath4 , since the logarithms @xmath70 vanish at that point .",
    "if @xmath71 , all graphs with internal heavy - quark lines are renormalized by zero - momentum subtraction .",
    "if @xmath72 , these graphs are renormalized in the @xmath68 scheme .",
    "the masses of the light quarks are neglected everywhere , and graphs with only light parton lines are always renormalized in the @xmath68 scheme .",
    "the physical picture behind the acot prescription is simple : the heavy quark is excluded as a constituent of the hadron for sufficiently low energy ( an @xmath73 flavor subscheme ) , but the heavy quark is included as a constituent for sufficiently high energies ( an @xmath8 flavor subscheme ) .",
    "the renormalization by zero - momentum subtraction below the threshold leads to the explicit decoupling of the heavy - quark contributions from light parton lines .",
    "as one consequence of the decoupling , all perturbative components of the heavy - quark pdf vanish at @xmath71 , so that a nonzero heavy - quark pdf may appear only through nonperturbative channels , such as the `` intrinsic heavy quark mechanism '' @xcite . since the size of such nonperturbative contributions remains uncertain , they are not considered in this study . at @xmath72 ,",
    "a non - zero heavy - quark pdf @xmath74 is introduced , which is evolved together with the rest of the pdfs with the help of the mass - independent @xmath68 splitting kernels . the initial condition for @xmath75",
    "is obtained by matching the factorization subschemes at @xmath76 . at order @xmath6 ,",
    "this condition is trivial : @xmath77 at higher orders , the initial value of @xmath75 is given by a superposition of light - flavor pdf s @xcite .",
    "a simple illustration of these issues is given in appendix  [ appendix : chg ] .",
    "the acot scheme possesses another important property : the coefficient function @xmath50 in this scheme has a finite limit as @xmath78 , which coincides with the expression for the coefficient function obtained in the massless @xmath68 scheme with @xmath8 active flavors .",
    "this happens because the mass - dependent terms in @xmath50 contain only positive powers of @xmath67 , while the quasi - collinear logarithms @xmath79 are resummed in @xmath75 . as a consequence of the introduction of @xmath75 ,",
    "the coefficient function @xmath50 includes subprocesses of three classes :    * _ flavor excitation _",
    ", where the parton @xmath40 is a heavy quark ; * gluon _ flavor creation _ , where @xmath40 is a gluon ; * and light - quark _ flavor creation _ , where @xmath40 is a light quark .",
    "in contrast , in the ffn scheme @xcite only the flavor - creation processes are present . the lowest - order diagrams for each class",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "an @xmath84 _ flavor - excitation _ contribution has roughly the same order of magnitude as the @xmath85 _ flavor - creation _ contribution .",
    "we return to this issue in the discussion of numerical results in section  [ sec : numericalresults ] , where we interpret the combination of the @xmath80 _ flavor - excitation _ contribution ( fig .  [ fig : diag2]a ) and @xmath81 _ flavor - creation _ contribution ( fig .",

    "should be retained only in the @xmath88 subprocess ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diag2]b ) .",
    "another important consequence will be discussed in section  [ sec : massivecss ] , where we show that the s - acot scheme leads to a simpler generalization of the @xmath25-resummation to the mass - dependent case .",
