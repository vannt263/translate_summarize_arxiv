    "correct modeling of wave attenuation is an important objective for several branches of acoustics and a vast literature is dedicated to this subject .",
    "we shall be concerned here with modeling of intrinsic attenuation ( i.e. excluding attenuation due to backscatter ) in the context of pressure wave equations used in acoustics . in this context",
    "many attenuation models have been constructed ad hoc to match some aspect of the experimental data without taking into account the physical nature of the wave motion involved .    in many applications the mathematical model of propagation of acoustic pulses ( longitudinal waves ) in bio - tissues and polymers",
    "is based on a linear wave equation for the pressure field .",
    "the pressure wave equation can be derived from the equations of motion of linear elasticity . in order to account for attenuation",
    "some authors included in the wave equation an additional term involving a fractional time derivative or a more general pseudo - differential operator acting on the time variable @xcite .",
    "this method of accounting for attenuation is called the time causal method in @xcite . in this context causality",
    "means that the pseudo - differential operator is the convolution with a causal distribution , which ensures the validity of kramers - kronig relations . in @xcite",
    "the time derivatives have been modified in order to ensure that the attenuation obeys a fixed power law with an exponent @xmath0 in the entire frequency range .",
    "it will be shown that in all these cases the resulting pressure wave equations are inconsistent with the viscoelastic equations of motion .",
    "introducing attenuation by modifying the time derivatives in the equations of motion is justified in the context of poroelasticity @xcite . in poroelasticity and poroacoustics the attenuation due to viscous flow in a porous medium",
    "is represented by the viscodynamic operator , which is a pseudo - differential operator acting on the time variables @xcite . in poroelastic equations of motion",
    "the viscodynamic operator is applied to the inertial terms . in viscoelasticity attenuation",
    "is introduced through a time convolution operator in the constitutive equations .",
    "it will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : derivation ] that in both the viscoelastic equations of motion and in the acoustic wave equation attenuation is represented by a term involving a pseudodifferential operator acting on both the time and spatial variables .",
    "this observation is not new , for example stokes equation has this structure .",
    "the attempts to explain the experimentally observed power law frequency dependence of attenuation in polymers , bio - tissues and some viscous fluids in terms of an oversimplified power law attenuation model @xcite result in unbounded phase speeds .",
    "experiments covering the range 1 250 mhz indicate that the exponent of the power law lies between 1 and 2 . in the oversimplified model",
    "it is assumed that the power law extends to the high frequency range . a power law with an exponent @xmath0 in the high - frequency range entails wave propagation with unbounded phase speed .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that experimental data lie in the low frequency range represented by the low - frequency asymptotics of viscoelastic relaxation models .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that viscoelastic solids ( i.e. viscoelastic media in which strain under constant load does not relax to 0 ) have power law exponents in the range 12 in the low - frequency range .",
    "exponents below one indicate that the material is a viscoelastic fluid - such as some bio - tissues subject to a constant shear load these general results are is corroborated by the analysis of specific relaxation models in @xcite for longitudinal waves .",
    "this indicates that experimental data can be explained in terms of viscoelastic models .",
    "kowar , schertzer and coworkers @xcite constructed lossy wave equations with a bounded propagation speed by applying causal attenuation operators to the elastic pressure wave equation , which ensures bounded phase speed .",
    "they found that superlinear attenuation rates exist only in the low frequency range covered by the experiments . in their model ,",
    "attenuation exhibits sublinear frequency dependence in the high frequency range .",
    "this approach however amounts to a modification of the time derivatives in the pressure wave equation , which is not consistent with viscoelastic equations of motion .",
    "if the pressure wave equation is derived from viscoelastic equations of motion but the attenuation grows at a superlinear rate in the high frequency range then the creep compliance is not concave @xcite .",
    "this contradicted by observations . in the special case of strict power law attenuation with an exponent @xmath0 in the entire frequency range",
    "it is easy to prove that the creep compliance is decreasing and convex .",
    "several researchers have avoided the problem by working directly with the equations of motion of linear viscoelasticity or thermo - viscoelasticity with an appropriate stress relaxation model @xcite .",
    "we shall however present an approximate derivation of a linear pressure wave equation based on the equations of motion of viscoelasticity .",
    "it will be thus demonstrated that viscoelastic attenuation is represented in the pressure wave equation by a _",
