    ", the disk - th2 model may be more compatible with the observational @xmath191 distribution .",
    "we note here that the simulations slightly over - produce the stars with high eccentricities ( @xmath191 close to @xmath177 ) with respect to the observations because the rr for those captured stars with extremely high eccentricities is quenched by the strong relativistic precession @xcite .",
    "for this inconsistency , part of the reason might be the observational bias in detecting the gc s - stars , i.e. , the stars with high eccentricities are less likely to be detected at @xmath262 @xcite ; and part of the reason might be the limitation of the arma model .",
    "but the main reason of the inconsistency does not appear to be due to ignoration of the `` bouncing effect '' demonstrated in figure 7 of @xcite , where the star starting from a low - eccentricity orbit and evolving close to a critical high - eccentricity orbit is then bounced back onto a low - eccentricity orbit due to the suppression of the rr by the fast gr precession at high - eccentricity orbits , as ( 1 ) the stars in our model are captured from tidal breakup of binary stars and they initially have eccentricities even higher than the critical eccentricities ; ( 2 ) during the simulation period , some of the stars have evolved onto low - eccentricity orbits as illustrated by the distribution at the low - eccentricity end in figure  [ fig : f4 ] , and the simulated stars at the high - eccentricity end are those that evolve relatively slowly ; and ( 3 ) the suppression of the rr due to the fast gr precession has been modeled in our work , as mentioned before ( e.g. , see the definition of @xmath221 above ) .",
    "the timescale of the rr process also depends on the mass of the field stars @xcite . to check this dependence ,",
    "we perform additional simulations by setting the mass of field stars to @xmath263 or @xmath264 but with the total mass of the field stars fixed . according to the results of these simulations , we find that the simulated gc s - stars are on orbits with too high eccentricities compared with the observational ones if @xmath263 , or on orbits with too low eccentricities if @xmath264 .    in the above calculations , a bahcall  wolf cusp for the background stellar system in the gc",
    "is adopted .",

    ", we also adopt @xmath265 to mimic the effect of a core - like distribution , and the perturbation on the gc `` s - stars '' is assumed to be dominated by main - sequence stars ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "in such a model , we find that the resulted s - stars on highly eccentric orbits with smaller pericenter distances are relatively more than those obtained from the cuspy model .",
    "the reason is that the rr is less efficient in the core - like stellar distribution , and thus the evolution of the eccentricities of gc `` s - stars '' is slower .",
    "the timescale of the rr process becomes much longer at the distance of the disks .",
    "stars in this region are less affected by the relaxation processes and may well preserve some of their initial orbital configurations .",
    "observations find many b - dwarfs in disk regions , with high eccentricities and more extended spatial distribution than disk stars . the resulted eccentricity  distance distribution of these stars by the rr compared with the observations may provide useful constraints on the formation of the gc s - stars @xcite .",
    "our simulations also produce many b - dwarfs in the disk region and their radial distribution is similar to the initial input ones for the injecting binaries .",

    "a detailed dynamical study for the b - dwarfs in the disk region is complicated and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the ejected stars move away from the gc after the breakup of their progenitor binaries and their velocities are gradually decelerated in the galactic gravitational potential .",
    "some of them are unbound to the galactic potential and can travel to the galactic halo and may appear as the detected hvss if their main - sequence lifetime is long enough compared to the travel time ; while others with lower ejecting velocity may return to the gc . to follow the subsequent motion of the ejected components , we adopt the milky way potential model given by @xcite , which involves four components , including the contributions from the central mbh , the galactic bulge , the galactic disk , and the galactic halo , i.e. , = _ bh+_bulge+_disk+ _ halo , where _ bh = -gm_/r , _",
    "bulge=- , _ disk = - , _ halo = - ( 1 + ) , respectively .",
    "the model parameters for the last three components are @xmath266 , @xmath267 , the core radius @xmath268 , the scale length @xmath269 , and @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the cosmic critical density , @xmath272 , @xmath273 is the cosmic fraction of matter , the virial radius @xmath274 , and the concentration @xmath275 .",
    "the bulge , the disk , and the halo potentials adopted here are all spherical . if adopting non - spherical potentials , i.e. , a triaxial bulge / halo and a flattened disk potential , the bending effect due to the non - spherical component on the trajectories of ejected stars is important only for those with @xmath276 on a timescale of @xmath277  myr , but it is negligible for hvss with relatively high speeds ( see * ? ? ? * ) . note that the radial distribution of the ejected stars surviving to the present time ( and correspondingly the predicted number of the detectable hvss ) may be slightly different if adopting a different galactic potential model .",
    "the total number of detectable hvss depends directly not only on how many stellar binaries can be injected into the immediate vicinity of the mbh , but also on the lifetime of these stars and the detailed settings on the imf , semimajor axis , and periapsis of the injecting stellar binaries ( see section  [ sec : num_simu ] ) .",
    "if the stellar binaries are injected from a far away region , the injection rate can be estimated through the loss - cone theory @xcite ; if the injecting stellar binaries originated from central stellar disks @xcite , the injection rate is difficult to estimate as the mechanism responsible for it is still not clearly understood ( cf .",

    "in this paper , we investigate the link between the gc s - stars and the hvss discovered in the galactic halo under the hypothesis that they are both the products of the tidal breakup processes of stellar binaries in the vicinity of the central mbh .",
