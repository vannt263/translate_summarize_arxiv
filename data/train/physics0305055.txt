    "the earthquake process in seismic faults is a very complex natural phenomenon that present geophysics , in spite of its considerable efforts , has not yet been able to put into a sound and satisfactory status .",
    "however , in the crucial field of earthquake prediction , recent years have witnessed significant advances . for recent thorough reviews dealing with this issue ,",
    "see keilis - borok ( 2002 ) ; keilis - borok and soloviev ( 2002 ) , and references therein , in particular chapter four by kossobokov and shebalin .",
    "see also lomnitz ( 1994 ) .",
    "the introduction of new concepts coming from modern statistical physics seems to add some light and put some order into the intrinsic complexity of the lithosphere and its dynamics .",
    "thus , for example , references to critical phenomena , dynamical systems , hierarchical systems , fractals , self - organized criticality and self - organized complexity are now found very frequently in geophysical literature ( turcotte , 2000 ; sornette , 2000 ; gabrielov et al . , 1999 ;",
    "gabrielov et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "hopefully , this conceptual framework will prove its usefulness sooner better than later .",
    "we have recently presented a simple statistical model of the cellular - automaton type which produces an earthquake spectrum similar to the characteristic earthquake behaviour of some seismic faults ( vzquez - prada et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the largest earthquakes on a fault or fault segment ( the events that break its complete length ) are usually termed characteristic ( schwartz and coppersmith , 1984 ; wesnousky , 1994 ; dahmen et al . , 1998 ) . for this reason , in the minimalist model the event of maximum size is called the characteristic one .",
    "our model is inspired by the concept of asperity , i.e. , by the presence of a particularly strong element in the system which actually controls its relaxation .",
    "this model presents some notable properties , some of which will be reviewed in section [ sec : properties ] . in section [ sec : jordan ] , an algebraic procedure for the exact calculation of the probability distribution of the time of return of the characteristic earthquake is presented .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to quantify the forecasting of the characteristic earthquake occurrence in this model , using seismicity functions , which are observable , but not stress functions ( ben - zion et al . , 2003 ) , which are not . in section [ sec : diagram ] , we construct an error diagram ( molchan , 1997 ; newman and turcotte , 2002 ) based on the time elapsed since the occurrence of the last characteristic event .",
    "this permits a first assessment of the degree of predictability . in section [ sec : improving ] , we propose a general strategy of classification of the seismic cycles which , adequately exploited in this model , allows a refinement of the forecasts .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] we present the conclusions .",
    "in the minimalist model ( vzquez - prada et al . , 2002 ) , a one - dimensional vertical array of length @xmath1 is considered .",
    "the ordered levels of the array are labelled by an integer index @xmath2 that runs upwards from @xmath3 to @xmath1 .",
    "this system performs two basic functions : it is loaded by receiving stress particles in its various levels and unloaded by emitting groups of particles through the first level @xmath4 .",
    "these emissions that relax the system are called earthquakes .    these two functions ( loading and unloading ) proceed using the following four rules :    1 .",
    "in each time unit , one particle arrives at the system .",
    "all the positions in the array , from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , have the same probability of receiving the new particle .",
    "when a position receives a particle we say that it is occupied .",
    "if a new particle comes to a level which is already occupied , this particle has no effect on the system .",
    "thus , a given position @xmath2 can only be either non - occupied when no particle has come to it , or occupied when one or more particles have come to it .",
    "4 .   the level @xmath5 is special .",
    "when a particle goes to this first position a relaxation event occurs .",
    "then , if all the successive levels from @xmath5 up to @xmath7 are occupied , and the position @xmath8 is empty , the effect of the relaxation ( or earthquake ) is to unload all the levels from @xmath5 up to @xmath7 . hence , the size of this relaxation is @xmath9 , and the remaining levels @xmath10 maintain their occupancy intact .",
    "therefore , the size of the earthquakes in this model range from 1 up to @xmath1 , being the event of @xmath11 the characteristic one . note that the three first rules of this model are exactly those of the forest - fires model ( drossel and schwabl , 1992 ) .",
    "our model has no parameter and , at a given time , the state of the system is specified by stating which of the @xmath12 @xmath13 ordered levels are occupied .",
    "each one of these possible occupation states corresponds to a stable configuration of the system , and therefore the total number of configurations is @xmath14 .",
    "these mentioned @xmath14 stable configurations can be considered as the states of a finite , irreducible and aperiodic markov chain with a unique stationary distribution ( durrett , 1999 ) .",
    "the evolution rules of the model produce an earthquake size - frequency relation , @xmath15 , that is shown in fig .",

    ", one easily observes that in this model the system resides often in the configurations of maximum occupancy , i. e. , in @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this last property can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : char]c , where we have represented , for @xmath17 , the time evolution of the level of occupancy , @xmath26 , in an interval long enough to observe the occurrence of several characteristic earthquakes .",
    "the typical pattern after a total depletion is a gradual recovery of @xmath26 up to a new high level of occupancy .",
    "once there , the system typically presents a plateau before the next characteristic earthquake . especially during the ascending recoveries , the level of occupancy @xmath26 suffers small falls corresponding to the occurrence of rather small earthquakes , that in this model are abundant .",
    "of course , one also observes that occasionally @xmath26 falls in a significant way corresponding to the occurrence of a @xmath30 intermediate earthquake .    due to the fact that this model is not critical , it is reasonable to consider it as an example of self - organized complexity ( gabrielov et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the function @xmath21 , for a minimalist system of size @xmath1 , is obtained from the markov matrix of the system , @xmath31 , following the following three steps : i ) the element of the last row and first column of @xmath31 is changed by a 0 . after this",

    "the why s of this recipe are explained in vzquez - prada et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , where @xmath21 for @xmath36 is explicitly obtained by mere inspection .",
    "the result is @xmath37 the explicit form of @xmath21 for larger values of @xmath1 , can be achieved by exploiting the jordan decomposition of @xmath32 , @xmath38 and hence , @xmath39    the matrix @xmath40 is formed by `` jordan blocks '' in the diagonal positions , i.e. , by square matrices whose elements are zero except for those on the principal diagonal , which are all equal , and those on the first superdiagonal , which are equal to unity .",
    "thus , the task of obtaining an arbitrary power of @xmath40 is simple because , as said , each jordan block is the sum of two conmuting matrices : one is a constant times the unity matrix , and the other is nilpotent .",
    "therefore , in the computation of any arbitrary power of @xmath40 , each block is independent and the corresponding newton bynomial formula can be applied . as an example , we now present the calculation of the case @xmath41 . in this case , @xmath42 which is decomposed as    @xmath43    therefore , @xmath44 and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : j3 ] )    @xmath45    thus , finally , @xmath46    one could optimistically guess that @xmath21 , for an arbitrary @xmath1 , can be deduced from the systematics observed in the previous low-@xmath1 cases .",

    "these two functions , in this first one - dimensional strategy of forecasting , are dependent only on the value of @xmath20 , that is , the time elapsed since the last main event , and to which the alarm is connected . using the function @xmath21 previously defined , they read as follows :    @xmath58    @xmath59    these two functions are plotted in fig .",

    "<S> using error diagrams , we quantify the forecasting of characteristic - earthquake occurrence in a recently introduced minimalist model . initially we connect the earthquake alarm at a fixed time after the ocurrence of a characteristic event . </S>",
    "<S> the evaluation of this strategy leads to a one - dimensional numerical exploration of the loss function . </S>",
    "<S> this first strategy is then refined by considering a classification of the seismic cycles of the model according to the presence , or not , of some factors related to the seismicity observed in the cycle . these factors , statistically speaking , enlarge or shorten the length of the cycles . </S>",
    "<S> the independent evaluation of the impact of these factors in the forecast process leads to two - dimensional numerical explorations . finally , and as a third gradual step in the process of refinement , we combine these factors leading to a three - dimensional exploration . </S>",
    "<S> the final improvement in the loss function is about @xmath0 . </S>"
