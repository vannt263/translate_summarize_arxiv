    "quantum mechanics mandates a degree of uncertainty in the properties of a physical system . in many - body systems , this uncertainty is manifest as quantum fluctuations between different , and often classically inspired , states of the system or its subcomponents .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum antiferromagnets provide an excellent example of a situation where the classical state , which would be nel order , is destroyed completely by quantum fluctuations , replaced by gapped or gapless states with complex correlations ( or `` entanglement '' ) but no magnetic order @xcite .",
    "the canonical gapless 1d quantum magnet , the @xmath2 heisenberg chain , has quasi - long - ranged spin correlations and massless , fractionalized `` spinon '' excitations @xcite ; its gapped counterparts , including the two - leg @xmath2 spin ladder @xcite , the @xmath3 `` haldane '' chain @xcite , and the frustrated @xmath2 ( @xmath4@xmath5 , `` majumdar - ghosh '' ) chain @xcite , all show exponentially decaying spin correlations , accompanied in the first two cases by robust triplet excitations and in the third by massive spinons .",
    "these properties are consequences purely of quantum spin fluctuations in the restricted phase space available in one spatial dimension , and significant progress has been made over the last two decades both in their theoretical description and in their experimental observation @xcite .",

    "a triplet excitation of any single dimer experiences complete frustration ( up to sixth order in a perturbative expansion @xcite ) and therefore the excitation band measured at low temperatures is almost completely flat , at an energy of approximately @xmath10  mev ( @xmath11  k ) @xcite .",
    "remarkably , if the temperature is increased to only @xmath12  k , this mode suffers a serious loss of intensity , and by 12 k it is essentially indiscernible , its spectral weight spread over the entire energy spectrum @xcite . some phenomenological proposals @xcite and one numerical study @xcite have tried to account for this anomalously strong decay of the one - triplet excitation , but with limited success .",

    "[ sec : intro ] , recent advances in dmrg techniques @xcite raise the possibility of qualitative improvements in the computation of finite - temperature spectral functions .",

    "( [ edsfah ] ) , are that the change in total spin may be only @xmath93 .    for the fully frustrated ladder ,",

    "the second type of contribution is from the effective number of excited energy levels involved in draining weight away from the one - triplon branch , and this quantity remains difficult to define . a reasonable hypothesis for the rapid loss of spectral weight would be that pairs of triplons scatter strongly , with an effective scattering length significantly larger than the lattice constant @xcite , and the area of this scattering region could be used to deduce a number of states .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that this is not the correct picture , in that the origin of the strong quasiparticle scattering lies in the presence of many multi - triplon bound states rather than in extended two - triplon ones .",

    "one of our primary findings is that this effect is dramatically stronger near the quantum phase transition out of the rung - singlet state , where many multiparticle excitations with anomalously low energies come to dominate the response of the system .",
    "it is known that srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 lies close to this transition in the shastry - sutherland model , which occurs at the ratio @xmath206 @xcite of the square - lattice and rung couplings , and thus we strongly suspect that the emergence of many low - lying multi - triplon bound states is precisely the physics of this material .",
    "we point out that the measured decay rate of the one - triplon band intensity with temperature @xcite , compared with calculations for the shastry - sutherland model exactly analogous to fig .",

    "will require detailed analysis of anisotropic models .",
    "the dynamical response of low - dimensional quantum magnets presents a major challenge both to theoretical understanding and to the most advanced numerical methods .",
    "this is particularly true for highly frustrated spin systems , which are characterized by an almost flat one - triplon excitation band at zero temperature , where little insight is available either into the temperature dependence of this single - particle dispersion or into the multiparticle dynamics developing at finite temperature .",
    "we have investigated these questions using the example of the frustrated two - leg spin ladder and we present systematic numerical results from exact diagonalization for the dynamic structure factor as a function of temperature , coupling ratio , and degree of frustration .",
    "we find that the fully frustrated system has a discrete spectrum of excitations .",
    "as the temperature is increased , spectral weight is transferred out of the one - triplon band to levels at a wide range of energies , including those below the one - particle gap ; these are the energy levels of highly localized bound states involving clusters of multiple neighboring triplons .",
    "close to the quantum phase transition at @xmath209 , the bound states lie very low in energy , they involve very large numbers of triplets , and the weight transfer is anomalously rapid .",
    "these many - particle excitations are extended objects and , as a consequence of the discrete spectrum , they persist as sharp spectral features even to infinite temperatures .",
    "one may ask whether these two remarkable qualitative features , the rapid transfer of spectral weight at temperatures much lower than the one - triplon gap and the persistence of well - defined peaks at very high temperatures , are connected . in principle , the rapid transfer of spectral weight depends on having a large number of low - lying energy levels in the spectrum , whereas the well - defined peaks are a specific consequence of having completely flat ( localized ) bands .",
    "however , it remains an open question whether a truly high density of low - lying states could be achieved in a system with ( weakly ) dispersive bands or lacking an exact convergence of levels at a quantum phase transition , and the rate of spectral - weight transfer in such cases may be limited .",
    "nevertheless , the first of these remarkable features offers an explanation for the qualitative physics underlying the observation by inelastic neutron scattering studies of the low - dimensional frustrated material srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 that the intensity of the one - triplon band is completely dispersed to states at all energies even at temperatures only 1/3 of its gap .",
    "the second of these features , namely the persistence of sharp excitation peaks at high temperatures in a fully frustrated system , remains to be investigated in experiment .",
