    "the knowledge of the abundance of heavy elements ( e.g. o , s , n , ne ) in the gas phase of star - forming regions play a key role in studies of stellar nucleosynthesis , initial mass function of stars and chemical evolution of galaxies .    to derive the total abundance of a given element ( x ) in ionized nebulae ,",
    "after to estimate the electron temperature and electron density of the gas phase , it is necessary to calculate the abundance of all its ionization stages ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , for the majority of the elements present in star - forming regions , only emission - lines of some ionization stages can be measured . in these cases ,",
    "the use of ionization correction factors ( icfs ) is necessary to derive the contribution of unobserved ions , as initially defined by @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the ion whose ionic abundance can be calculated from its observed emission - lines .    in particular , for sulphur , in the most of the cases",
    "the total abundance is calculated by a direct determination of the abundance of the ions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , through the lines [ ] @xmath6@xmath66716,31 and [ ] @xmath6@xmath69069 , 9532 respectively , and by using an icf to correct the unobserved @xmath7 , which produces forbidden lines at 10.51@xmath8 m . in the pioneer work , @xcite proposed an icf for the sulphur based on both @xmath4 and @xmath5 ions and given by @xmath9^{-1/\\alpha}.\\ ] ] along decades , the value of @xmath0 have been largely discussed in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite , using the photoionization models of @xcite , which assume the non local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) stellar atmosphere models of @xcite , suggested @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite , who used a sample of regions and planetary nebulae , derived @xmath11 . @xcite",
    "combined spectroscopic data of regions containing the [ ] @xmath6@xmath69069 , 9532 emission - lines ( not considered by most of previous works ) with photoionization models assuming different stellar atmosphere models in order to estimate an icf for the sulphur . from this analysis , @xcite suggested that an intermediary @xmath0 value between 2 and 3 is correct .",
    "@xcite , using the optical and infrared spectroscopic data of @xcite , were able to derive directly an icf for the sulphur and concluded that @xmath10 is correct for @xmath12 , being their results less clear for higher ionization stages ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "direct estimations for the sulphur icf , such as the one performed by @xcite , require infrared spectroscopic data of regions as well as direct measures of electron temperatures , difficult for objects with low ionization degrees @xcite .",
    "thus , sulphur icfs have been mainly calculated by using photoionization models , in which not comparison with observational data are performed .",
    "other important subject is the relative abundance between sulphur and oxygen , which has a direct impact on studies of stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "these elements arise from the nucleosynthesis in massive stars @xcite , however , there are two fundamental issues ill - defined : ( a ) the knowledge of the mass range of stars that dominates the production of these elements .",
    "( b ) if the initial mass function ( imf ) of stars is universal . for decades",
    ", studies based on optical spectroscopic data of star - forming regions have been used to solve these problems but , not conclusive results were obtained .",
    "for example , @xcite , who derived sulphur abundances for a sample of 13 extragalactic regions , found a constant s / o abundance over a range of o / h ( generally used as metallicity tracer ) , which suggests that either these elements are produced by massive stars within a similar mass range or by stars of different masses but with an universal imf @xcite . this result",
    "is supported by the majority of other works done in this direction ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , evidences of s / o ranges with o / h were found , for example , by @xcite in the galaxy m33 and by @xcite in m51 .",
    "moreover , due to large dispersion in s / o for a fixed value of o / h ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the idea that s / o does not range with the metallicity is somewhat uncertain @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we employ a grid of photoionization models of regions and a large sample of optical and infrared spectroscopic data of star - forming regions with the following goals :    \\1 .",
    "to derive icfs for the sulphur based on a consistent comparison between ionic abundances predicted by photoionization model and calculated from observational data .",
    "\\2 . to compare the discrepancy in s / h abundances computed by using different icfs .",
    "\\3 . to investigate the s / o - o / h relation in star - forming regions considering different icfs for the sulphur .",
    "this paper is the first ( paper i ) of a series of three works , where in the out - coming papers we will present a comparison of @xmath13 abundances obtained from optical and infrared lines and a comparison between s / o and o / h abundances with prediction of chemical evolution models .",
    "similar analysis was performed for the neon by @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ obs ]",
    "the observational data used along the paper are presented . in section",
    "[ mod ] , we describe the photoionization models used to derive icfs for the sulphur , while methodology adopted to derive the ionic abundances is given in section  [ ionic ] .",
    "in section  [ result ] the results containing the icfs obtained by using photoionization models and from observational emission - lines are presented .",
    "discussion and conclusions regarding the outcome are given in sections  [ disc ] and [ conc ] , respectively .",
    "we compiled from the literature emission - line intensities of regions and star - forming galaxies obtained in the optical and infrared spectral ranges .",
    "these measurements were used to obtain sulphur and oxygen ionic abundances in order to verify if our photoionization models are representative of real regions , to check if the theoretical icfs are compatible with the ones derived directly from observations and investigating the s / o - o / h relation .",
    "the selection criterion for the visible - sample was the detection of the intensity lines [ ] @xmath6@xmath63726 + 29 ( hereafter refereed as [ ] @xmath63727 ) , [ ] @xmath6@xmath64363 , 5007 , [ ] @xmath6@xmath66717 , 31 and [ ] @xmath69069 .",
    "in the cases where the [ ] @xmath66717 and @xmath66731 lines were not resolved , the sum of the intensity of these lines were considered .",
    "for some objects ( indicated in table  [ tab1 ] ) the theoretical relation @xmath14[]@xmath69069=@xmath14[]@xmath69532/2.5 was used to estimate the emission line intensity of @xmath69069 , since only the sum of these was available .    since regions and star - forming galaxies",
    "are indistinguishable in diagnostic diagrams ( e.g. @xcite ) , these objects were considered jointly in our analysis . to eliminate objects with a secondary ionizing source",
    ", we use the criterion proposed by @xcite to distinguish objects ionized by massive stars from those containing an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and/or gas shock . hence all objects with @xmath15\\lambda5007/h\\beta \\ : < \\ : \\frac{0.72}{[log([s\\:ii]\\lambda\\lambda6717 + 31/h\\alpha)]-0.32}\\ ] ] were selected . in figure  [ fdia ] the objects in our sample and a curve representing the criterion above are shown .    in the appendix ,",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the object identification , optical emission - line intensities ( relative to h@xmath16=100 ) and bibliographic references of the sample .",
    "we obtained optical data of 118 objects .",
    "all emission - line intensities were reddening corrected by the authors of the original works from which we have taken the data .",
    "@xcite showed that effects of using heterogeneous data sample , such as the one used in this paper , do not yield any bias on the results of abundance estimations in the gas phase of star - forming regions .",
    "we also considered emission - line intensities of 143 galaxies of a sample of 310 galaxies considered by @xcite and selected from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite data release 3 .",
    "we applied a similar selection criterion above but with small changes due to the shorter wavelength spectral coverage of the sloan data ( when [ ] @xmath63727 is observed [ ] @xmath69069 is not , and vice versa , depending on the object redshift ) .",
    "hence we selected the objects that present the [ ] @xmath69069 emission lines and [ ] @xmath67325 instead of [ ] @xmath63727 .",
    "these objects are also represented in fig .",
    "[ fdia ] but are not listed in table  [ tab1 ] .    concerning the ir - sample , the selection criterion was the presence of the flux measurements of the emission - lines 4.05 @xmath8 m , [ ] 10.51@xmath8 m and [ ] 18.71@xmath8 m .",
    "we compiled infrared data of 103 objects classified as being regions and nuclei of galaxies containing star - formation regions .",
    "only nine objects have both optical and ir data . in the appendix , in table  [ tab2 ] , object identification , fluxes of the emission - lines considered and bibliographic references of the sample are listed . in some cases , indicated in table  [ tab2 ] , the 4.05 @xmath8 m emission - line fluxes were computed from 12.37 @xmath8 m or hi2.63 @xmath8 m fluxes , assuming the theoretical ratios 4.051@xmath8m/12.37@xmath8m=8.2 and hi4.051@xmath8m / hi2.63@xmath8m=1.74 taken from @xcite for @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 k.    for the objects with emission - line measurements at different spatial positions , indicated in the table  [ tab2 ] , the adopted fluxes were the sum ( integrated ) of the individual ones .",
    "the purpose of this procedure is to avoid taking exclusive emission - lines from outer parts of regions into account , which the diffuse gas emission ( e.g. @xcite ) component can be important but it is not considered in our photoionization models .    the aperture sizes in which the optical and infrared data were taken for a same object can be different from each other , yielding uncertainties in our results .",
    "in fact , @xcite presented a detailed analysis of the effect of considering different aperture on determinations of physical parameters of galaxies .",
    "they have found that systematic and random errors from aperture effects can arise if fibres capture less than 20 per cent of the galaxy light .",
    "most of the star - forming regions in our sample can be treated as point sources , and almost all the object extensions are observed .",
    "therefore , this effect seems to be negligible for our sample of objects .",
    "we built a grid of photoionization models using the cloudy code version 13.03 @xcite to estimate an icf for the sulphur .",
    "these models are similar to the ones presented by @xcite and in what follows the input parameters are briefly discussed :    * spectral energy distribution  the synthetic spectra of stellar clusters with 1 myr , built with the @xmath20 @xcite assuming the wm - basic stellar atmosphere models by @xcite , and the 1994 geneva tracks with standard mass loss with metallicities @xmath21 , were considered . *",

    "although the relation between n and o presents a high dispersion ( e.g. @xcite ) this does not affect the results of the present study , since we do not use nitrogen emission - lines . since the relation between s / o and metallicity is uncertain @xcite , five grids of models",
