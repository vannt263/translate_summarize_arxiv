    "we shall give an indication of the problem on random matrix theory that led us to the non - commutative cycle lemma .",
    "let @xmath13 be the free group on the @xmath14 generators @xmath15 and let @xmath16 be a word in @xmath17 . by a word we mean a string a letters which may or may not simplify .",
    "the _ length _ of a word is the number of letters in the string . following usual terminology",
    ", we shall say that @xmath18 is reduced , or to be more precise _ linearly reduced _ , if for all @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "we shall say that @xmath21 is _ cyclically reduced _ if in addition @xmath22 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath21 is cyclically reduced if @xmath23 is linearly reduced .",

    "we say that a word @xmath21 is _ reducible to 1 _ if it reduces linearly to the identity in @xmath13 .",
    "one should note that for reductions to 1 there is no difference between linear and cyclic reducibility ; any word that can be reduced cyclically to 1 can also be reduced linearly to 1 .",
    "if the reduced word @xmath24 is not the identity then the situation will be quite different for the two cases @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath25 any cyclic reduction can also be achieved in a linear way , but this is not the case for @xmath26 any more . in particular , whereas the linear reduction of a word is always unique , this is not true any more for the cyclic reduction .",
    "for example , the word @xmath27 , which reduces linearly to @xmath28 , has two different cyclic reductions , namely @xmath29 and @xmath30 . since one can think of the cyclic reduction as acting on the letters arranged on a circle , it is clear that any two cyclic reductions are related by a cyclic permutation .",

    "starting with any word @xmath39 with @xmath40 we let @xmath41 be its @xmath42-th prefix , @xmath43 .",
    "then the dominating property of @xmath44 is equivalent to the fact that no prefix @xmath41 ( @xmath45 ) of @xmath46 is reducible to 1",
    ".    for example let @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; then the only cyclic permutation of @xmath49 that is dominating is the identity permutation .",
    "equivalently , of the five cyclic permutations of @xmath50 , only @xmath50 ( i.e. apply the identity permutation ) has no prefixes which are reducible to 1 .",
    "now let us consider the same problem when the word contains more than one generator .",

    "the linear reduction of @xmath21 is cyclically reduced .",
    "( in the case of only one generator , this condition is always satisfied . )",
    "we can then ask how many cyclic permutations of @xmath21 have good reduction ; and our main result is that this is the same as the number of letters in a cyclic reduction of @xmath21 .",
