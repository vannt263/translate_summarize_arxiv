    "at low values of @xmath0 , qcd evolution , both dglap@xcite and bfkl@xcite , predict a striking increase of the parton densities which violate unitarity constraints @xcite .",
    "therefore , interactions between partons in the parton cascade , omitted in qcd evolution equations , should become essential to slow down the growth of the parton densities .",
    "we expect that these interactions will create an equilibrium -like system of partons with a definite value for the average transverse momentum , which we call a saturation scale ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "in other words , we expect a picture of a hadron as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : sat]@xcite .",
    "this talk is an attempt to review all our knowledge on saturation at low @xmath0 both theoretical and experimental , to stimulate a search for saturation effects at thera . in spite of the fact",
    "that the high density qcd phase was only briefly discussed in the thera contribution to the tesla tdr , everybody knows that * if saturation effects are seen at thera it will be the machine , while if not , it will remain one of many*. the main goals of this presentation are    * to discuss an intuitive picture of the deep inelastic scattering that leads to the saturation of the parton densities ; * to show that the saturation hypothesis has solid theoretical proof ; * to report on the theoretical progress that has been made over the past two years in high parton density qcd , and on the property of the saturation phase that emerges from the theory that has been developed ; * to collect all that we know theoretically and experimentally about the saturation scale @xmath1 .",
    "thera are two different ways to reach a high parton density phase : the first , is dis at low @xmath0 , the second is deep inelastic scattering on a nuclear target in which we have a rather large parton density from the beginning , due to a large number of nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "the best avenue to investigate the high density phase is to use both paths and to measure dis on nuclei at low @xmath0 .",
    "this is one of the thera options and we will also discuss saturation phenomena for such a reaction .",
    "it is well known that deep inelastic scattering is most clearly visualized in a space - time picture in the bjorken frame where the virtual photon has zero energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the bjorken frame the electro - magnetic field is a standing wave with wavelength of the order of @xmath3 for a photon with four momentum @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : bjfr ] ) . in this frame",
    "the fast hadron decays into a system of partons .",
    "each parton has a longitudinal momentum @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a fraction of the energy of incoming hadron carried by the parton , and a transverse momentum @xmath7 . due to the uncertainty principle",
    "each parton is localized in @xmath8 and , therefore , only partons with @xmath9 can interact with the photon , since for all other partons the overlap integral is very small . in other words ,",
    "the parton which interacts with the photon has @xmath10 . using",
    "the energy and momentum conservation for the parton - photon interaction one can easily obtain and the recoiled energy are equal(@xmath11 ) , the conservation of the longitudinal moment leads to @xmath12 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 . ] that @xmath15 which gives @xmath16 at low @xmath0 .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath17-th parton is of the order of @xmath18 where the lifetime in the rest frame of the @xmath17-parton @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the parton that interacts with the photon lives for a short time @xmath21 and because of this the interaction can not change the parton distribution , and destroys only the coherence of the partons in the incoming hadron .    over a long period of time",
    "every parton can decay into a large number of partons .",
    "theoretically we can only control the emission of the partons with large values of the transverse momenta , as the qcd coupling is small for them , and we can safely use the developed methods of perturbative qcd .",
    "[ fig : lev : bjfr ] shows the evolution of the partons with definite transverse momenta ( @xmath22 ) ( with definite size @xmath23 ) in time ( so called the bfkl evolution ) .",
    "@xmath24 is the size of the hadron .",
    "the first stage of the evolution for partons with @xmath25 is not under theoretical control and only non - perturbative qcd will be able to give us information on probability ( @xmath26 ) to find several partons with @xmath27 and @xmath25 in the hadron .",
    "the bfkl evolution takes into account the emission of partons with @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig : lev : bjfr ] shows that it is natural to expect that this emission leads to a considerable increase of the number of partons .",
    "the number of partons that can interact with the target ( virtual photon ) can be written in the form of the convolution @xmath29 .",
    "we can obtain the result of the dis experiment by taking the convolution ( overlapping integral ) with the photon wave function .",
    "in other words , the deep inelastic structure function is equal to @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the wave function of the virtual photon .    recalling that @xmath33",
    "one can see that the unitarity constraint @xmath34 leads to a conclusion that the increase of the parton densities due to the bfkl ( or dglap ) emission should be tamed @xcite .",
    "the simple idea how such taming can occur is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : bjfr ] . indeed , if the parton cascade has been measured at early time ( at rather high @xmath0 ) the density of the partons in the transverse plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lev : bjfr ] ) is not large , and we have to take into account emission , since emission is proportional to the density ( @xmath35 ) of partons ( * emission @xmath36 @xmath37 * ) .",
    "however , the density of partons increase due to emission and at some value of @xmath0 the system becomes so dense that partons cover the hadron disc .",
    "in such a situation the interactions of the partons start to be essential .",
    "these interactions are proportional to the square of the parton density since two partons have to meet in one point for this interaction ( * annihilation * @xmath36 @xmath38 @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the typical cross section of two parton annihilation in the parton cascade ) and they cause the number of particles to diminish .",
    "therefore , we expect there to be an equilibrium between emission and annihilation in the dense system of partons which can be described by simple equation :    @xmath41    the first term of this equation gives the bfkl evolution at low @xmath0 while the second one provides a taming of the density increase .",
    "of course , all coefficients in the equation can not be calculated in framework of such oversimplified approach , including numerical coefficient @xmath42 .",
    "the principle prediction of this equation is the saturation of the parton density , namely , the fact that the parton density stops increasing .",
    "it should be stressed that at any value of @xmath43 , even a very large value , there exists a small value of @xmath0 at which we face saturation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lev : satpic ] ) .",
    "@xmath44 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : satpic ] is a packing factor for the partons and we will discuss its value later .      the bjorken frame is the frame which is best suited for the discussion of dis in the parton ( qcd ) approach , since both pictures fig .  [",

    "[ fig : lev : satpic ] give the parton distributions in a hadron , or , in other words , term @xmath45 in eq .",
    "[ eq : lev : f2 ] . however , it turns out that some properties of the high density parton system are clearer in the laboratory frame where the hadron is at rest . as we will see below , the fact that our partons are colour dipoles is easy to demonstrate in this frame .",
    "the time - space picture of dis in this frame is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : labfr ] .    in the lab .",
    "frame the fast virtual photon decays into a quark - antiquark pair ( two partons in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : labfr ] ) .",
    "quark ( antiquark ) has transverse momentum larger than @xmath46 and exists for a sufficiently long time ( @xmath47 ) we can easily obtain using the uncertainty principle:@xmath48 where @xmath49 is the difference in energy between initial and final states . for the virtual photon decay we have @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the energy of produced quark ( antiquark ) . ] .",
    "if the time @xmath52 is long enough , quarks ( antiquarks ) radiate gluons ( as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lev : labfr ] ) which create a dense parton system in the same way as in the bjorken frame .    at first sight pictures fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : bjfr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : labfr ] look quite different .",
    "of course , the final result of the measurement ( the total photon - hadron cross section ) given by eq .",
    "[ eq : lev : f2 ] , remains the same in both frames , but only part of eq .",
    "[ eq : lev : f2 ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : labfr ] , namely , @xmath53 .    therefore , the main difference between these two figures , fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : bjfr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : labfr ] is the following : fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : bjfr ] shows all partons which can interact with the photon target , while the system of partons that has interacted with the virtual photon is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : labfr ] .",
    "one can see that the bjorken frame is much better for describing the parton densities , we will show in the next section the laboratory frame is very useful in answering the question : what are these partons in qcd .      the advantage of the lab .",
    "frame becomes clear if we want to understand how the produced quark -antiquark pair ( which is a colour dipole ) interacts with the target .",
    "the main observation is that the size ( @xmath54 in fig .  [",
    "fig : lev : mgfor ] ) of the colour dipole or , in other words , the transverse distance between the quark and antiquark , is a good degree of freedom , which is preserved by the high energy qcd interaction @xcite . indeed ,",
    "while the colour dipole is traversing the target , the distance @xmath54 between the quark and antiquark can vary by an amount @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the energy of the dipole in the lab .",
    "frame and @xmath24 is the size of the target ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : mgfor ] ) . due to the uncertainty principle",
    "the quark transverse momentum is @xmath57 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath58    if @xmath59 since @xmath60 , and recalling the definition of the bjorken @xmath0 one can see that @xmath61    a. mueller proved two results@xcite which really showed that the colour dipoles are the correct degrees of freedom in qcd at high energies .",
    "first , he showed that the gluon structure function can be viewed as the interaction of the colour dipole with the target as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : mgfor ] .",
    "secondly , he proved that the bfkl evolution can be rewritten as a decay of one dipole into two dipoles for large @xmath62 , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : dig ] .",
    "therefore , we can discuss the high energy ( low @xmath0 ) dis in terms of colour dipoles which interact with themselves and with the target .",
    "it turns out that for an interaction with the target we can obtain the simple glauber - mueller formula which reads @xcite    @xmath63    with opacity @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the target profile function . in the case of a nucleon target we can use the gaussian form of @xmath66 while for nuclei we use the wood - saxon parameterization for @xmath67 .",
    "[ eq : lev : gmf ] is a solution to the @xmath68-channel unitarity constraint for the dipole - target amplitude @xmath69 the inelastic cross section is equal to @xmath70 opacity @xmath71 describes the interaction of one parton shower with the target as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : mgfor ] .    as has been mentioned",
    "the real breakthrough was the proof by a. mueller that the gluon structure function can be calculated using a similar formula for the colour dipole rescatterings , namely @xcite @xmath72      eqs .",
    "[ eq : lev : gmf ] , [ eq : lev : inx ] and [ eq : lev : mggstr ] allow us to introduce a packing factor for colour dipoles in the parton cascade .",
    "this factor is equal to @xmath73    the physical meaning of @xmath74 is very simple : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 is the size of the parton ( or preferable to say its typical cross section ) multiplied by the density of gluons in the transverse plane .",
    "it should be stressed that all our observables can be calculated if we know the dipole amplitude .",
    "indeed , the main obsevables such as the total photon - hadron cross section , the gluon density and single diffraction production inclusive cross section , have a very simple relation with the dipole amplitude , namely , @xmath78    eq .  [ eq : lev : o1 ] was proven in refs.@xcite , while eq .",
    "[ eq : lev : o2 ] was first written in ref.@xcite and was discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the formula for the total diffractive production in dis was suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "the argument @xmath79 in eq .",
    "[ eq : lev : o2 ] reflects the fact that actually the rescattering of gluon corresponds to rescatterings of two dipoles of the same size , which works effectively as the interaction of one dipole but with a size which is @xmath80 larger ( for @xmath81 ) .",
    "@xmath82 was calculated in refs.@xcite .",
    "using the colour dipole picture of an interaction and , in particular , the fact that the bfkl emission can be viewed as a decay of one colour dipole into two ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lev : dig ] ) we can easily obtain the nonlinear equation for the imaginary part of the elastic dipole - target amplitude @xmath83 .",
    "this equation can be written in the form ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : lev : eq ] : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and we assume that that @xmath86 or / and @xmath87 .",
    "[ eq : lev : glrint ] has a very simple meaning and actually describes the fact that the dipole of the size @xmath88 decays into two dipoles of sizes @xmath89 and @xmath87 with probability @xmath90 as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : dig ] .",
    "these two dipoles then interact with the target .",
    "they can interact separately and this interaction leads to the linear term in eq .",
    "[ eq : lev : glrint ] .",
    "however , two produced dipoles can interact with the target simultaneously generating the non - linear term in the equation . from fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : eq ] one can see that this non - linear term takes into account the glauber correction for the two dipole interaction.the minus sign in front of the non - linear term reflects the well known fact that we overestimate the value of cross section considering it as a sum of two independent collision , since sometimes one dipole happens to be in the shadow of the second one . the linear term in eq .",
    "[ eq : lev : glrint ] is the bfkl evolution , which describes the evolution of the multiplicity of the fixed size colour dipoles with respect to rapidity @xmath91 . at first sight",
    "the linear term sums the leading twist contribution while the non - linear one is related to higher twist contributions .",
    "however , this is not true .",
    "the first term ( the bfkl equation ) has also higher twist contributions but with the same anomalous dimension as the leading twist ones .",
    "on the other hand , as was pointed out by mueller and qiu @xcite the non - linear part contributes mostly to the leading twist .",
    "the beauty of the equation is that it sums both leading and higher twist contributions in a unique fashion and claims that at any fixed @xmath43 ( at any short distance ) , the higher twist contribution will dominate at sufficiently low @xmath0 .",
    "[ eq : lev : glrint ] shows that the problem of high density qcd has been solved from first principles and we think that it is instructive to give a brief review of the theoretical approaches that all converge to this equation .    * 1981 - 1983",
    "* glr pointed out the new phase of qcd - high density qcd , developed picture of parton interaction in the bjorken frame ( see above ) , proposed the hypothesis of parton saturation and suggested first non - linear equation which sums the `` fan '' diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : lev : fan]-a and which is actually eq .",
    "[ eq : lev : glrint ] in momentum space@xcite .",
    "* 1986 * mueller and qiu @xcite proved the glr equation in the double log approximation of perturbative qcd .",

    "[ fig : lev : nsol2 ] shows that the taming of the parton densities growth included in the master equation can easily reduce the value of the gluon density at thera and lhc energies by 2@xmath92 3 times , at different values of @xmath43 .",
    "the main message that i want to deliver in this presentation is very simple : * _ due to the hard work of number of experts , the theory of high parton density qcd has been established _ * , and this theory includes the proof of :    * the nonlinear evolution equation for the dipole - target amplitude at fixed @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) ; * the saturation of the parton densities as @xmath95 which means that @xmath96 at low @xmath0 ; * the new scaling phenomena @xmath97 for @xmath98 ; * the sharp increase of the saturation scale @xmath99 in the region of low @xmath0 ; * the importance of the saturation effects in taming the growth of the gluon density at thera and lhc energies .",
    "we would like to stress that during past two decades we have developed the perturbative qcd methods@xcite , based on the correct degrees of freedom : colour dipoles at high energies@xcite and created new operator methods of tackling this problem , such as the wilson loop operator expansion@xcite and the effective lagrangian approach@xcite .",
    "my personal feeling is that the future is in the operator methods since they provide a possibility to describe the matching of the high density qcd with real non - perturbative qcd with large coupling constant in a unique way .",
    "however , i would like to emphasize the positive aspects of the pqcd approach : a clear physical picture in the pqcd calculations and , because of this picture , the transparent understanding of the meanings of observables which we calculate in pqcd .",
    "the whole development of this new area of theory i consider as a triumph of approach of my teacher , prof .",
    "gribov , to high energy physics , which could be formulated as _ * `` physical picture - first , mathematics - after if ever''*_@xcite .",
    "indeed , i am very certain that the remarkable progress , that we see now , was possible only , because the picture that has been discussed in the first section , was correct from the beginning .        *",
    "the dglap evolution equation is more fundamental and has better proof than non - linear one .",
    "it is not true because * * the glap equation yields the parton densities which violate the unitarity constraints ; * * the next to leading order corrections to the dglap evolution equation have to be included at energies @xmath100 ( see section 3.4.1 ) which are much higher that the energy @xmath101 when the parton rescatterings and recombinations start to be essential ; * * it does not contain any proof of why the higher twist contribution is smaller , than the leading twist one , which has been incorporated in these equations ; * * these equations demand initial conditions which we do not know how to treat theoretically or extract experimentally .",
    "* by choosing the initial value for the dglap evolution @xmath102 to be large enough , we can claim that the higher twists contributions are small .",
    "it was shown that the anomalous dimension of the higher twists is much larger that the leading one @xcite and at any value of @xmath43 at low @xmath0 , the higher twist will exceed the leading twist ( dglap ) contribution .",
    "therefore , the practical procedure of solving the dglap evolution equation , can not be considered to be free of justified criticism ; * the calculation of higher order corrections of pqcd will improve our description of the experimental data .",
    "the pqcd series are the asymptotic series and they have intrinsic accuracy , which can not be improved by calculating additional orders in @xmath103 , and this accuracy is rather poor in the region of low @xmath0 . to evaluate errors we have to use the next order calculation in pqcd as an error , but with the same initial conditions .",
    "[ fig : lev : map ] displays the qcd map which is as the result of this approach .",
    "three separate regions are distinguished by the size of the variables @xmath43 and @xmath0 .",
    "each region corresponds to quit different physics .    *",
    "1 . perturbative qcd domain * where the constituents are of small size and their density is rather small so that we can neglect their interactions ( recombinations ) . the packing factor @xmath104 , and we can view this region as the traditional region for the linear qcd evolution equations ( the dglap and bfkl ones ) . in this region",
    "the parton system appears as a colour dipole gas , since we have here a rather dilute system of colour dipoles .    *",
    "high parton density qcd domain * in which the constituents are still small and we can use weak coupling methods , but their density is so large that the gluon field in this region becomes strong .",
    "we call the parton system in this domain a colour glass condensate@xcite , because gluons have colour , their fields evolve very slowly relative to the natural scale and are disordered . in simple words glass",
    "is a solid on a short time scale and a liquid on long time scale . in lectures by l.",
    "maclerran @xcitethe reader can find the arguments why the parton system in this domain looks like a glass .",
    "we have a condensate because of high parton density and strong gluon fields in this region .    *",
    "non perturbative qcd domain * in which the qcd coupling is large ( @xmath105 ) . in this region",
    "the confinement of quarks and gluons occurs and a real non perturbative approach should be developed here .",
