    "the dominant thermal flux during type i bursts and superbursts offer an ideal opportunity for studying neutron star ( ns ) properties through spectral measurements of their photospheres ( e.g. london , taam & howard 1984 , 1986 ; foster , ross & fabian 1987 ) . though never confirmed , the reports by waki et al .",

    "cottam , paerels & mendez ( 2002 ; hereafter cpm ) observed the accreting ns  using the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) aboard the xmm - newton satellite and claimed detection of hydrogen - like and helium - like fe absorption features from the @xmath6 h@xmath0 transitions during type i bursts .",
    "letter _ is an initial study on the implications of the hydrogen - like feature and predictions for heavy element abundances near the photosphere .",
    "the helium - like feature will be left for future work .",
    "xmm / newton observed  for 335 ks during which 28 type i x - ray bursts were seen .",
    "cpm combined the burst spectra and split them into a high luminosity ( @xmath7 ) part ( from the initial rise and fall ) and a low @xmath7 part , which covers the fading to the baseline @xmath7 . in the high @xmath7 part",
    ", the detected absorption line was identified as the h@xmath0 transition of hydrogenic fe . in the low @xmath7 spectrum , a line identified as the he - like h@xmath0 transition was seen . for these identifications ,",
    "cpm measured the ns s gravitational redshift at @xmath8 , giving @xmath9 from the line centroid ( neglecting the rotational corrections of fujimoto 1985 ; zel & psaltis 2003 ) .",
    "these spectra have photospheric temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 , using the measured color temperatures ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; cpm ) and correcting for the redshift and spectral hardening from comptonization ( london et al . 1986 ; madej 1997 ) .    in   2 , we calculate the fe abundance when accretion is active , showing that proton spallation of fe ( bildsten , salpeter & wasserman 1992 ; hereafter bsw ) naturally yields @xmath14 for accretion of solar metallicity material .",
    "the spallation also produces large columns of elements with @xmath3 , which could be observable via their photoionization edges during the cooling phase of the burst or a radius expansion burst . in   3 ,",
    "we show that stark broadening ( paerels 1997 ) dominates the h@xmath0 line equivalent width and that the measured equivalent width ( properly redshifted to the ns surface ) of @xmath15 ev implies an fe column of @xmath16 depending on line depth . however , these abundance calculations are highly uncertain due to non - lte ( nlte ) effects and resonant line transport which we believe play an important role in the line formation .",
    "we summarize in  4 and note that the radiative flux during the burst can levitate hydrogenic fe .",
    "the continuum photosphere for the 1.276 kev photons of the fe h@xmath0 transition is at an electron column density of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the thomson cross section .",
    "if @xmath19is uniformly abundant at the solar value ( @xmath20 by number ; grevesse & sauval 1999 ) above the continuum photosphere at 1 kev then @xmath21 . joss ( 1977 ) showed that convection during the burst can not bring burning fluid elements to the photosphere as the entropy there exceeds that in the burning layers by large factors .",
    "hence , we look to fe in the accreted material as the likely source of the photospheric elements .",
    "bsw studied the deposition and separation of accreting elements , and we use their results here .",
    "imagine first that accretion halts during the burst . in a pure h atmosphere ,",
    "the upward pointing atmospheric electric field is @xmath22 , so that the force on fe is @xmath23 .",
    "the counter - balancing drag force on the drifting fe nucleus is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron - proton coupling from bsw .",
    "the downward drift speed is @xmath26 so that it takes @xmath27 for fe to fall to a column depth @xmath28 .",
    "hence , if accretion halts , fe would sink beneath the photosphere in much less than the burst duration .    given the sub - eddington peak luminosity , accretion likely remains active during the bursts .",
    "kuulkers et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown this to be the case for gx 17 + 2 . the persistent flux from  when type i bursts occur implies @xmath29 ( gottwald et al . 1986 ; cpm ) .",
    "in order to obtain a lower limit on the accretion rate per unit area we assume that the accretion covers the whole ns , so that @xmath30 .",
    "the measured redshift implies @xmath9 ( cpm ) , so that the ns s surface is inside the last stable orbit regardless of its rotation rate ( kluzniak & wagoner 1985 ; kluzniak , michelson & wagoner 1990 ) .",
    "the resulting accretion gap allows for the accreting beam to strike the atmosphere with a velocity comparable to free - fall ( kluzniak & wilson 1991 ) , realizing the coulomb stopping scenario of zeldovich and shakura ( 1969 ) .",
    "the integration of a free trajectory from the last stable orbit to the surface yields an impact angle @xmath31 and kinetic energy of @xmath32 mev / nucleon .    since some angular momentum and energy can be lost in the accretion gap , we presume that @xmath33 and fix the incident energy at @xmath34 mev / nucleon , resulting in stopping a particle of charge @xmath35 and mass @xmath36 after traversing a vertical column @xmath37 .",
    "bsw showed the repercussions of the @xmath38 scaling : ( i ) the incident electrons stop first , ( ii ) hydrogen and helium penetrate furthest to @xmath39 , and ( iii ) all heavier elements stop prior to the h / he beam .",
    "for example , fe stops at @xmath40 and is spalled by the energetic protons ( of current @xmath41 ) until it has sunk to safety ( i.e. @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is the mechanism shown by bsw to destroy accreted heavy elements .",
    "grazing incidence reduces the distance that must be fallen to reach safety and increases the surviving fraction of the incident cno elements relative to that in bsw .",
    "the infalling fe could have bound electrons as it spirals into the ns surface .",
    "however , the combination of varying doppler shifts and the short flight time compared to the residence time in the atmosphere ( derived below ) means that the inflow is an unlikely environment for narrow line formation .",
    "we thus focus our discussion on the thermalized fe in the atmosphere . at 200 mev per nucleon ,",
    "@xmath43% of the incident fe suffer a charge changing nuclear reaction before traversing @xmath44 and thermalizing .",
    "accretion is thus depositing thermal fe into the ns atmosphere at @xmath45 at a rate @xmath46 .",
    "for the spallation cross section ( i.e. that cross section for @xmath47 to be chipped to lower z ) @xmath48 ( silberberg et al . 1998 ) the fe lifetime to spallation from the proton beam is @xmath49 .",
    "the fe must sink to a depth of @xmath50 for safety , so that when @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) , destruction dominates settling ( i.e. @xmath53 ) .",
    "hence , as long as @xmath54 during the burst exceeds 1% of that occurring prior to the burst , the destruction by the proton beam completely determines the fe residence time in the upper atmosphere .",
    "this seems a condition easily satisfied for many bursters and greatly simplifies the calculation of @xmath55 as well as the stark broadening discussed in   3 , since , in this limit",
    ", the fe is present only near the stopping point . because of the complicated interplay of the currents and forces in the upper atmosphere ( see bsw ) , the local abundance near the stopping point ranges from @xmath56 times the incident abundance .",
    "the proton spallation reduces the fe abundance as it sinks , imprinting an abundance profile @xmath57 , which is an exponential decay with depth .",
    "the fe rich region above the fe poor layer puts a small inverted gradient in the mean molecular weight ( @xmath58 ) that would trigger a rapid overturn in an isothermal layer if @xmath59 .",
    "gradients this large will not be reached as long as the accreting material has an abundance less than ten times solar .",
    "doubly diffusive instabilites might still occur , but those timescales are likely no shorter than @xmath60 .",
    "hence , for finding @xmath55 , we only need to balance the fe destruction rate ( neglecting the @xmath0 beam is less than a 20% effect , as those cross sections are rarely larger than twice those induced by protons ; ferrando et al .",
    "1988 ) @xmath61 , with the fe deposition rate @xmath62 , giving @xmath63 due to neutron knockout reactions , about 10% of those fe nuclei are @xmath64 and 5% are @xmath65 .",
    "the fe column is comparable to the uniform solar abundance calculation because @xmath66 .",
    "since many spallation reactions occur as the nuclei sink , we also found the abundances of all lower @xmath67 and @xmath68 nuclei .",
    "we calculated this nuclear cascade by following the evolution of each isotope under the constraint that production equals destruction .",
    "the cross - sections from silberberg et al .",
    "( 1998 ) were used .",
    "we found that the sum of all nuclei with @xmath69 outnumber fe by a factor of 2.5 - 3.0 ( see table 1 ) . in the absence of the bsw spallation scenario",
    ", these nuclei would not be present .",
    "the single most abundant heavy nucleus is @xmath70 .",
    "the immediate question that comes to mind is whether these spallation products can be detected .",
    "they may be detected via their h@xmath0 lines , but the calculation of their predicted ew is left to future work . in table 1 , we find the @xmath71 at which @xmath72 of these nuclei would be in the hydrogenic state ( for @xmath73 in table 1 ) , allowing for a possible photoionization edge detection once @xmath74 ( presuming lte ) . to fit all @xmath67",
    ", we used the explicit cross - section from rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) and set the bound - free gaunt factor to @xmath75 , giving @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the edge energy ( shown in table 1 , value in parentheses is the redshifted edge energy ) from bethe & salpeter ( 1957 ; hereafter bs ) .",
    "this @xmath78 agreed to within ( 3 - 5)% to verner et al.s ( 1996 ) analytic fits for ar , ca and fe .",
    "for now , we estimate the impact of such an edge on the spectrum by considering the integral over the optical depth above the photoionization edge , @xmath79 , assuming an effectively cold atmosphere ( i.e. no reemission above the edge ) @xmath80 . for @xmath81 , the @xmath82 integral",
    "is simply expanded to obtain @xmath83 integrated from @xmath84 to @xmath85 which is independent of @xmath67 .",
    "table 1 shows @xmath82 assuming the element is present at the level implied by the spallation scenario and finding the amount of it in the hydrogenic ground state from saha equilibrium for @xmath86 .",
    "as the burst cools or during a radius expansion burst , these edges could become prominent , and the entry of @xmath87 in table 1 presumes all of the spallation created elements have at least one bound electron .",
    "it is intriguing to note that these edge energies and @xmath82 are close to those previously reported by waki et .",
    "al . ( 1984 ) , turner & breedon ( 1984 ) , nakamura et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , magnier et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and kuulkers et al .",
    "we now estimate the fe column needed to give the h@xmath0 line observed by cpm . motivated by our accretion scenario , we initially presume that this line forms in a thin isothermal layer of fe in lte at temperature @xmath88 above the hotter continuum photosphere .",
    "the observed redshift implies a surface gravity of @xmath89 .",
    "though rapid rotation ( @xmath90 ) might explain the observed line width ( @xmath91 ) , the line s equivalent width depends most strongly on the intrinsic broadening mechanisms .",
    "the scale for thermal doppler broadening is @xmath92 .",
    "the natural line width , @xmath93 ( bs ) , is given by the spontaneous decay rate for the @xmath94 transitions , which in units of the thermal doppler shift is @xmath95 .",
    "we now show that stark broadening is larger by an order of magnitude than either of these effects for the h@xmath0 transition .",
    "stark broadening results from the shift of line energies due to the electric field from neighboring ions , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the mean ion spacing ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "the energy perturbation from the linear stark effect is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the size of the orbital . using the linear stark effect",
    "is justified since its energy shift at the densities and temperatures considered exceeds that of the degeneracy breaking lamb shift for the relativistic h - like ion ( bs ) . for the @xmath100 state of fe at a thomson depth unity , we find @xmath101 , an order of magnitude larger than thermal doppler .    since the majority of the intrinsic line width is attributed to stark broadening , @xmath55 must be found from the measured ew given by the curve of growth ( mihalas 1978 ) , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the ew in energy units , @xmath104 is the normalized line depth at line center , @xmath105 is the intrinsic energy width ( in our case the stark shift ) , @xmath106 is the ratio of the line opacity to the continuum opacity and @xmath107 .",
    "we use the electric field distribution for a uniform ion sea ( e.g. the holtsmark distribution , @xmath108 ; mihalas 1978 ) , giving @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the ratio of line optical depth to continuum optical depth at line center . depending on density either thermal doppler or stark broadening dominates ,",
    "so we convolve the holtsmark distribution with the voigt profile to cover the complete range of densities .",
    "we also ignore debye screening effects on the electric field distribution since the deviation from the holtsmark distribution is small for the typical @xmath88 and @xmath111 .",
    "because rotational broadening acts to lower the apparent line depth and is likely to be important , the observed value of @xmath112 is a lower limit .",
    "indeed , the true line depth could be significantly larger than 0.3 .",
    "however , such a large value of @xmath104 is difficult to understand for realistic temperature gradients and presuming lte . for a gray atmosphere ( a reasonable approximation for the temperature profile of a type i burst atmosphere )",
    "@xmath104 attains a maximal value of 0.2 when the fe resides at very low column depths .",
    "the resolution of this dilemma may be the role of nlte effects and resonant line transport in the h@xmath0 line .",
    "resonant line transport could generate such an absorption feature with a large line depth without invoking large temperature contrasts as in lte ( jefferies 1968 ) .",
    "nlte effects clearly play a role in determining abundances from the ew measurements .",
    "for instance , an immediate measure of the role of nlte effects is that the radiative ionization rate for the fe ground state exceeds the collisional ionization rate ( london et al .",
    "1986 ) , complicating the ionization balance for fe .    to resolve the role of nlte effects ,",
    "the radiative transfer equation must be solved self - consistently for both the resonant transport of the h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 lines with detailed balanced of the fe ionization and excitation in the strong radiation field of a type i burst . for",
    "now , we simply present results for @xmath113 , which is set by observations and @xmath114 , which is characteristic of a gray atmosphere .",
    "we calculate the @xmath55 required to reach @xmath115 presuming all fe resides at the column depth , @xmath116 .",
    "we assume lte and that the dominant states for fe are either fully ionized , or in the hydrogenic ground state or helium - like ground state to approximate the partition function . for radial infall , with the fe layer between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "this temperature range is consistent with the absence of helium - like fe in the high @xmath7 phase of the burst ( cpm ) .",
    "since the occupation of the @xmath120 state exceeds that in @xmath121 by @xmath122 , we also calculate @xmath123 for the implied @xmath55 values .",
    "for this line , thermal doppler and natural line broadening dominate stark broadening ( madej 1989 ) . when @xmath124 and the fe resides at the pressure implied by radial accretion , @xmath125 .",
    "foster et al .",
    "( 1987 ) also calculated @xmath126 for a uniformly distributed fe abundance at the solar value and found that it would not exceed @xmath127 .",
    "it would require an @xmath128 to give an fe column consistent with that calculated from spallation .",
    "however , such large temperature contrasts ( and hence such large values of @xmath104 ) are not possible in these atmospheres and we need to understand the nlte line transport problem before we can address this apparent inconsistency .    day , fabian & ross ( 1992 ) pointed out that a uniform presence of fe at the solar value would create an observable photo - ionization edge .",
    "the fe column require to produce the observed h@xmath0 line would yield enormous edges . however , nlte effects would weaken the strength of these photoionization features significantly ( london et al .",
    "the reported broad spectral features in the 6 - 9 kev range ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1990 , strohmayer & brown 2002 ) during type i bursts and superbursts need to be re - analysed as possible fe photo - ionization edges .",
    "active accretion in the context of a beam hitting the atmosphere naturally gives @xmath129 which only depends on the physics of proton spallation of fe . in this scenario ,",
    "heavy elements with @xmath3 are produced in quantities comparable to fe and may be observed via their photoionization edges or atomic lines ( see table 1 ) during the cooling phase of type i bursts or superbursts .",
    "our initial lte calculations have found that an fe column of @xmath130 is needed to produce the measured @xmath131 of cpm .",
    "however , until a more complete calculation of the resonant line transport for the h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 line has been undertaken in this strong radiation environment , we can not say whether this factor of twenty discrepency is certain .    throughout this paper",
    ", we have presumed that fe is present because of active accretion during the burst . however , the radiative force on hydrogenic fe in the ground state is @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the flux per photon energy at the ly@xmath0 transition ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "since @xmath133 is nearly constant across the line , @xmath135 in the optically thin limit ( michaud 1970 ) , where @xmath136 is the oscillator strength from bs . if @xmath137 is given by a black - body , then at @xmath138 , the radiative acceleration on fe is @xmath139 , a factor of three larger than @xmath140",
    ". the radiative force will be even larger for realistic type i burst spectra , which are harder than a blackbody at the observed @xmath141 ( london et al .",
    "1986 ; pavlov , et al .",
    "the fe diffusion time is less than the burst duration , so there is adequate time for the accelerated fe to reach a new diffusive equilibrium .",
    "the calculation of the resulting fe column , which could well saturate the line and lower the radiative force , is beyond the scope of this _ letter _ , as it requires a simultaneous solution of the radiative transfer and the fe diffusion equations , like that done for hot white dwarfs ( e.g. chayer , fontaine & wesemael 1995 ) .",
