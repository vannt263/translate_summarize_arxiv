    "based on different observations , models and equations governing deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and related processes , a `` saturation '' regime is expected when certain values of low enough @xmath2 and relevant @xmath3 are reached . according to the dipole model of dis , this regime already has been achieved and it is characterized by the `` saturation radius '' @xcite @xmath4 with @xmath5 gev@xmath6 and @xmath7 found from a fit to the dis data at @xmath8 on more general grounds , saturation could be expected also from unitarity : the rapid ( power - like ) increase with @xmath9 of the structure functions / cross sections may suggest that unitarity corrections will tamper this rise , although formally the froissart bound has never been proven for off - mass - shell particles , thus unitarity does not provide any rigorous limitation for such amplitudes@xcite .",
    "one more argument is physical : the rise of the structure function @xmath1 reflects the increase of the parton density ( parton number in the nucleon ) . since this number increases as a power , and",
    "the nucleon radius is known to increase as @xmath10 ( or , at most @xmath11 ) ( shrinkage of the cone ) , the particle number density within a nucleon increases , inevitably , reaching a critical value where the partons start to coalesce ( overlap , recombine etc ) .",
    "the qualitative picture of this phenomenon in the @xmath12 plane is well known and cited in various contexts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "quantitatively , the dynamics depend on many , poorly known , details , such as the properties of the constituents and their interaction within the nucleon .    below",
    "we propose a novel approach to the saturation phenomenon in dis and related processes based on the collective properties of the excited nucleon .",
    "namely , we suggest that , below the saturation regeon , the nucleon in dis is seen as a gas of almost free partons . with their increasing density ,",
    "the constituent gradually overlap and , starting from a certain value of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the gas of free partons coalesce condensing in a liquid of quarks and gluons .",
    "saturation corresponds to the onset of the new phase .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of such an excited nucleon are characterized by its temperature , pressure etc , and a relevant equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the statistical treatment of partonic distributions is by far not new , see e.g. @xcite . what is new in our approach , is the interpretation of the saturation in dis as a manifestation of the transition from a dilute partonic gas to a liquid . the details ( nature ) of this ( phase ? ) transition are not known .",
    "it can be of the first , of second order , or , moreover , be a smooth cross - over phenomenon .",
    "our main argument is that the volume of the nucleon confining the partons ( quarks and gluons ) in the interior increases slower , at most as @xmath13 ( more likely , as @xmath14 ) , while the volume occupied by the interior , quarks and gluons , increases as a power , thus resulting in a limiting behavior : a gas - to - liquid cross - over or a phase transition .",
    "the present contribution is a first step in understanding this complex processus .    in a related paper , ref .",
    "@xcite , the phase structure of the hadronic matter in terms of its temperature @xmath15 and its baryochemical potential @xmath16 , was studied in the framework of the percolation theory .",
    "the percolation mechanism was used in @xcite to obtain a limiting energy dependence of the hadronic matter at @xmath17 .",
    "we define the saturation line ( in the @xmath18 plane ) as the turning point ( line ) of the derivatives @xmath19 called @xmath20 or @xmath21 slopes , where @xmath1 is a `` reasonable '' model for the structure function , i.e. one satisfying the basic theoretical requirements , yet fitting the data . for example , the model for @xmath1 of ref.@xcite interpolates between regge behavior at small @xmath3 and the solution of the dglap evolution equation at asymptotically large values of @xmath22 practically for all values of @xmath2 . the resulting two - dimensional projection of the @xmath23 slope is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in our interpretation ,",
    "the critical line ( saturation = phase transition ) occurs along the fold line on this figure ( compare with a similar figure , fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , derived from a different model ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is the identification of this line(point ) with the critical line(point ) on the @xmath24 phase diagram of an excited nucleon viewed as a thermodynamical system .",
    "the thermodynamical approach to dis may provide a new insight to this complex phenomenon .",
    "we are aware of the limited time scales in a deep inelastic scattering from the point of view of thermalization , a familiar problem relevant to any thermodynamical description of hadronic systems .",
    "let us only remind that the thermodynamic approach to high - energy scattering and multiple production , originated by fermi and landau s papers , were applied to hadrons , rather than heavy ions .",
    "the statistical model of parton distributions in dis was considered and developed in quite a number of papers @xcite . in its simplest version , one assumes @xcite that inside the nucleon , the valence quarks , as well as the sea quarks and antiquarks and gluons form a noninteracting gas in equilibrium .",
    "this simple picture may be further developed in two directions : 1 .",
    "introduction of the effect of the finite size ( and its energy dependence ! ) of the nucleon on statistical expression for the number of states for the unit energy inerval ; 2 ) account for the @xmath3 evolution , that can be calculated either from the dglap equation or phenomenologically , as e.g. in ref.@xcite .",
    "a likely scenario emerging @xcite for this high quark density @xmath25 system is that quarks form cooper pairs and new condensates develop .",
    "the nucleon of mass @xmath26 consists of a gas of massless particles ( quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) in equilibrium at temperature @xmath15 in a spherical volume @xmath27 with radius @xmath28 increasing with squared c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath29 as @xmath10 ( or @xmath30 ) .",
    "the invariant parton number density in phase space is given by @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the degeneracy ( @xmath33 for gluons and @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 of a given flavor ) , @xmath37 is the parton four - momentum and @xmath38\\pm 1\\bigr)^{-1}$ ] is the fermi or bose distribution function with @xmath39 .",
    "quantities in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) are labeled by the subscript @xmath40 .",
    "the invariant parton density @xmath41 in the imf is related to @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the proton rest frame as follows @xcite @xmath44 and the structure function @xmath45.\\ ] ] without any account for the finite volume of the hadron , this sf disagrees with the data .",
    "finite volume effects can be incorporated , following r.s .",
    "bhalerao from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the result is @xmath46 where @xmath27 and @xmath47 are energy dependent and @xmath48 @xmath49 in front of the surface and curvature terms , are unknown numerical coefficients .",
    "their values are important for the final result , but they can not be calculated from perturbative qcd . a rather general method to calculate these important parameters can be found in ref .",
    "we intend to come back to this point in a subsequent publication .",
    "percolation as a model of phase transition from colourless hadrons to a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) was studied in a number of papers , recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "below we apply the arguments of that paper to the saturation inside a nucleon , where extended ( dressed ) quark and gluons , rather then mesons and baryons considered in ref.@xcite percolate into a uniform new phase of matter .",
    "both objects are coloured particle inside a colourless nucleon .",
    "we start with a short introduction to the subject .",
    "consider @xmath50 spheres of radius @xmath51 and hence volume @xmath52 in a `` box '' of size @xmath27 , with @xmath53    percolation ( _ clustering _ ) of spheres , in three spacial directions , was studied for the case of :    \\a ) arbitrary overlap @xcite and b ) for those with impenetrable hard core , allowing only partial overlap @xcite .",
    "for the case a ) , the first percolation point ( partial percolation ) , with @xmath54 of occupation , occurs for the density @xmath55 , the largest cluster having the density of about @xmath56 a second percolation point occurs at @xmath57 when @xmath58 of space is covered by spheres , i.e. the vacuum disappears as a large - scale entity .",
    "the existence of two percolation thresholds , one for the formation of the first spanning cluster of spheres and the the second one for the disappearing of a spanning vacuum `` cluster '' , is a general feature of the 3-dimensional percolation theory .",
    "\\b ) an impenetrable spherical core , with @xmath59 , and the spheres can only partially overlap . here",
    "again one has two percolation thresholds , at @xmath60 ( close to the case a ) ) , and vacuum percolation , at @xmath61 , requiring a higher density compared to a ) .",
    "the number of constituents in a nucleon can be found by integrating in @xmath63 ( impact parameter ) the general parton distribution , e.g. that of ref .",
    "@xmath64 here , contrary to @xmath65 @xmath66 is dimensional , with a dimension of squared mass @xmath67 interpreted as the transverse size of the extended parton in the hadron , @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the partons number density @xcite . in paper @xcite , @xmath70 was a constant ; here we choose it to depend on the the photon virtuality : @xmath71 where @xmath70 is the mass of the lightest vector meson , @xmath72 .",
    "note the inequality @xmath73 where @xmath74    thus , the nucleon is composed of @xmath75 extended partons with the transverse area @xmath76      one has for mesons @xmath77 on the other hand , mesons percolate whenever @xmath78 where @xmath79 and we use for the probe meson radius @xmath80 which in the limit of a real photon , @xmath81 matches the relevant value @xmath82 fm used in ref .",
    "@xcite . solving @xmath83 yields @xmath84 as the limiting temperature through meson fusion ( cf .",
    "@xmath85 mev of @xcite ) . in a similar analysis of the phase diagram of hadronic matter @xcite ,",
    "the ( @xmath23 independent ) limiting temperature @xmath86 mev was obtained .    _",
    "the parameters appearing below should be rescaled with account for the replacement @xmath87 ! _",

    "@xcite @xmath90 with increasing nucleon density , the empty vacuum disappears for @xmath91 , which , for real photons",
    "@xmath92 corresponds to about @xmath93 times standard nuclear density .",

    "in this talk a new approach to the saturation phenomena in deeply virtual processes - dis , dvcs , vmp - diffractive and non - diffractive - is suggested .",
    "the basic idea is a physical one : bjorken scaling implies that the nucleon in dis and related processes is a system of weekly interacting partonic gas , that can be described by means of bose - einstein or fermi statistics .",
    "as the density increases ( with decreasing @xmath2 and relevant @xmath3 ) , seen as the violation of bjorken scaling , the system reaches a coalescence point where the gas condenses , eventually to a liquid .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of this transition can be only conjectured , and further studies are needed to quantify this phenomenon .    of two models presented in this note , more promising seems be the first one ( sec .",
    "3 ) . further studies will show its viability .",
    "an alternative measure of the onset of saturation and expected change of phase can be related to non - linear evolution equations .",
    "saturation and a phase transition are expected when the non - linear contribution overshoots the linear term .",
    "the phenomenon discussed in the present note may have much in common with the colour glass condensate proposed in the context of heavy ion collisions ( see , e.g. @xcite and earlier references therein ) .",
    "apart from similarities ( condensation of quarks and gluons as @xmath102 there are apparent differences : for example , hydrodynamical flow is not expected in dis . in any case , the dynamics of the strong interaction is the same in lepton - hadron , hadron - hadron and heavy ion collisions .",
