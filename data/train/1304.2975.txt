    "recent progress in implementing controllable multiqubit systems in the laboratory has sparked renewed interest in topological quantum computing schemes .",
    "particular attention has been devolted to the surface code @xcite , which is a planar version of kitaev s toric code @xcite . from a physical implementation viewpoint ,",
    "the surface code has two important advantages in comparison to other schemes : ( i ) all gates are local , and ( ii ) simulations indicate that the topological protection yields very high tolerance for errors .",
    "the latter is based entirely on stochastic models for errors .",
    "these models point to error threshold probabilities per single qubit operation or cycle ranging from 1% @xcite , when only nearest neighbor interactions and no perfect gates are assumed , up to 19% @xcite , when the ability to perfectly measure four - qubit operators is assumed .",
    "the large error threshold comes at the expense of hardware : a vast number of local operations and physical qubits is required to build a useful computing machine @xcite . yet , this tradeoff seems attractive nowadays for a number of physical realizations such as cold atoms @xcite , ion traps @xcite , rydberg atoms @xcite , semiconductor systems @xcite , and superconducting integrated systems @xcite .",
    "most error threshold estimates so far have relied on the assumption of errors being uncorrelated in time and space .",
    "however , given the large - scale integration that will be required to implement a surface code , this assumption seems unwarrantable on physics grounds .",
    "the need to have tens of millions of physical qubits siting on a common substrate and interacting with each other and with the controlling electronics is very likely to introduce environmental modes , which will effectively couple the time evolution of the physical qubits . under these circumstances",
    ", errors will become correlated and it is unclear whether the system will retain its high error threshold .",
    "in fact , previous studies of the impact of correlated errors on standard ( non - topological ) quantum computing codes have shown that error thresholds may be reduced or altogether disappear in some situations @xcite .",
    "investigating the effect of correlations between errors in the surface code is the main goal of this paper .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", two of us showed that the time evolution of the surface code in the presence of a common bosonic bath can be mapped onto a statistical spin model .",
    "this mapping allows for the computation of the surface code fidelity much in the same way that one computes the partition function and expectation values in a spin model . as a result",
    ", the existence of an error threshold was related to the existence of a phase transition in the statistical model . even though the interpretation of the crossing of the error threshold as a classical phase transition is not new @xcite , our formulation takes into account the full quantum mechanical time evolution of the qubits in the presence of a dynamical environment .",
    "in addition , rather than evaluating error probabilities , we compute directly the fidelity of the logical qubit .",
    "our choice of environment , a collection of freely propagating massless bosonic modes , is realistic for systems where decoherence can be related to the coupling to phonons , magnons , and electromagnetic modes .",
    "below , we provide a detailed derivation of the evolution operator of the combined surface code  bosonic bath system .",
    "we focus our attention on a single quantum error correction cycle and assume that , after the syndrome extraction , the bath is reset to its ground state . within this approximation , we find that the fidelity can be written as a function of the expectation value of single - qubit logical operators .",
    "the study of these expectation values can be related to the physics of an ising - like spin model with a complex fictitious temperature . under the assumption of noncyclic and perfect stabilizer measurements",
    ", we use both exact and mean - field finite numerical calculations to argue that the spin model sustains a thermodynamic phase transition in the limit of an infinite number of physical qubits .",
    "system with 25 and 41 qubits are studied numerically .",
    "the critical temperature of the spin model yields a coupling constant threshold value which is found to depend mainly on bath parameters .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : surfacecode ] we give a give a brief introduction to the essential elements of the surface code and set some of the notation used later .",
    "section [ sec : bosonic ] presents a hamiltonian formulation of the problem in terms of bosonic modes coupled to physical qubits which allows us to obtain a compact form for the evolution operator of the combined logical qubit ",
    "bath system .",
    "the evolution operator involves a bath correlation function which is explicitly evaluated for three representative situations .",

    "[ fig : lattice ] ) .",
    "notice that vertices and tiles form dual lattices .     two - dimensional square lattice structure for a surface code .",
    "physical qubits ( circles ) are located at the edges of the lattice , which has open ( vertical ) and closed ( horizontal ) boundaries . in the general case ,",
    "the lattice is @xmath19 in size , with @xmath20 vertical and @xmath21 horizontal edges and @xmath22 physical qubits .",
    "the light colored strips show possible paths for the logical operators @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",

    "the protected code space contains two states , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "both states are eigenstates of all stabilizer operators with eigenvalue @xmath26 .",
    "errors can be inferred by measuring the stabilizer operators and tracking down which stars or plaquettes yielded @xmath27 values .",
    "a decoding procedure is needed to decide which recovering operation to perform @xcite .",
    "the code state can be generated by the action of a product involving all star operators on the @xmath28 ferromagnet state , namely , @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 notice that the product in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gop ] ) can be expanded as @xmath33 the number @xmath34 appearing in the prefactor of @xmath35 is the number of terms appearing in the expansion : @xmath36 .",
    "the most general bath model would allow for both flip and phase errors to occur .",
    "however , only perturbative calculations would be possible in this general case .",
    "since our goal is to obtain nonperturbative results , we focus our discussion on flip errors only ( it is possible to rephrase the model to induce only the pure dephasing by a simple change of basis ) .",
    "we do not explicitly consider correlated errors introduced by the hardware upon measurement , but rather errors induced by the interaction between a bath and the qubits during the time span of a qec cycle .",
    "the hamiltonian we consider is written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a free bosonic hamiltonian , @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the spatial location of a qubit @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a local bosonic operator , @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the bath spatial dimension , @xmath46 is the bosonic mode velocity , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is a characteristic frequency of the bath ( notice that @xmath43 is dimensionless since we adopt units such that @xmath49 ) .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators of the bosonic modes follow the standard commutation relations , namely , @xmath50 = \\delta_{{\\bf k } , { \\bf k}'}$ ] and @xmath51 = [    a_{{\\bf k}}^\\dagger , a_{{\\bf k}'}^{\\dagger}]=0 $ ] .",
    "the choice of @xmath52 depends on the physical nature of the environment and on which bosonic degree of freedom couples to the qubits . when the qubits couple directly to the bosonic displacement field , we choose @xmath53 , whereas when they couple to the bosonic current operator , we choose @xmath54 instead .",
    "notice that these two choices allow us to write the coupling between the qubits and the bosonic environment as a simple function of the free bosonic field .",
    "hence , they render an interaction hamiltonian with commutators that are subluminal , namely , which are equal to zero outside the boson light cone ( see below ) .",
    "but this is not the general rule .",
    "for instance , a model that couples the environment to two different qubit components would render an interaction hamiltonian with non - subluminal commutators ( regardless of our choice for @xmath52 ) .",
    "this apparent problem comes from the fact that we usually think of errors in a dynamical sense : they happen in a point in space - time and create bosons that propagate at the speed of light .",
    "however , this is an incorrect interpretation to the equations we are about to derive",
    ". we will not be considering pulses propagating thought a medium , but rather looking at allowed normal modes of the bath and how they relate to different qubit configurations .",
    "if there is no fundamental symmetry reason for their suppression , long - wave length modes of the bath will in general introduce superluminal effective interactions . a very simple way to highlight this fact is to rewrite the bosonic model in a coherent - state basis , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 also obey standard commutation relations and @xmath58 in a constant .",

    "thus , for this particular case , @xmath97 the environment state is unaffected by the error correction protocol .",
    "if no extra step is taken to dissipate excitations that pile up over time , the environment will keep a memory of events that happened during the qec period . keeping track of such excitations between qec cycles in a fidelity calculation",
    "is a difficult task even for simple , non - topological logical qubit systems @xcite . for topological qubits ,",
    "the task is considerably harder due to the exponential number of terms that enter in the composition of the computational states .",
    "thus , in order to make the formulation amenable to an analytical calculation , we consider an extra step to the qec protocol .",
    "in addition to projecting the quantum computer wave function back to the logical hilbert space , we assume that at the end of the qec step the environment is reset to its ground state .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing at the end of the qec step the projector @xmath98 , for some environment temperature @xmath99 defined with respect to some even larger reservoir .",
    "a consequence of this extra qec hypothesis is that we exclude from the calculation any spatial correlation between qec periods , as well as memory and spatial correlations between the time evolution of bras and kets .",
