    "hermes focuses on spin physics using @xmath2 gev polarized lepton beam with @xmath3 and different polarized targets .",
    "hera - b studies charm and beauty sector of the standard model by utilizing 920 gev proton beam interacting with internal wire target .",
    "first running period , so called hera-1 , was completed in year 2000 and has delivered 120 pb@xmath4 per collider experiment . presently , after the luminosity upgrade , data taking has started at hera-2 with the aim being to collect polarized @xmath5 scattering data of @xmath6 fb@xmath4 . to fully exploit the potential of this unique facility it is proposed to extend its running for another five years available between hera-2 and tesla  @xcite  a major future international hep project .",
    "this third running period , termed here hera-3 , would provide yet deeper insight into fundamental qcd questions , which is not possible in present hera configuration .",
    "before discussing the future of lepton - nucleon scattering let see what did we learn at hera and where will we be by the year 2006/7 , the end of the hera-2 data taking period . in this context",
    "we focus on qcd aspects and the structure of the nucleons .",
    "low @xmath7 physics and related to that diffractive dis constitute a major impact of hera data on qcd in its high energy limit ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the discovery of the strong rise of the proton structure function @xmath9 at low @xmath7 has triggered a discussion about when and how this steep rise should slow down due to parton saturation .",
    "fig  [ fig:1]a shows that nlo qcd using linear dglap evolution equations is able to describe inclusive dis data in whole @xmath7 range down to very low @xmath10gev@xmath11 .",
    "this suggests the saturation regime is not yet reached at hera .",
    "still , since the low-@xmath7 behavior is governed by gluons one may hope first to see a sign of saturation in diffraction whose cross section is proportional to the gluon density squared : @xmath12 . indeed , by comparing the energy rise of the inclusive and diffractive dis cross sections , parametrised as @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively",
    ", one can see some systematic shift between the two ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) .",
    "the error bars for diffractive points are still large , and one of the tasks for hera-2 is to improve precision of @xmath15 measurement and to quantify this so far only qualitative statement .",
    "( 16.7,8)(0.1,0 ) ( 0.0,0.0 ) ( 8.2,-0.4 ) ( 1.0,7.0)(a ) ( 15.0,7.0)(b )    to summarize , there is a controversy about parton saturation at hera , both between theorists and experimentalists .",
    "it is believed that the saturation scale  @xcite , @xmath16 , is too small in hera - ep .",
    "one needs conditions when linear dglap evolution equations break down unambiguously and the parton shadowing effects ( or the processes of gluon recombination ) become apparent yet in perturbative domain ( @xmath17 ) . in order to achieve this",
    ", gluon density should somehow be magnified .",
    "it is possible either by increasing energy , @xmath18 ( thera  @xcite option ) , or by using nuclear target instead of protons , @xmath19 ( hera-3 , eic  @xcite ) . as an example , @xmath20 scattering at hera-3 would be equivalent in terms of gluon density to @xmath21 collider .",
    "another important aspect of qcd is the spin structure of the nucleon . how do the partons conspire to ensure the total spin of the nucleon",
    "is @xmath22 ? as quarks can not account for the total nucleon spin ( the fact known since 1988 as `` spin crisis '' ) it is important to measure other components : gluon polarization @xmath23 and orbital angular momenta @xmath24 . in that",
    "respect first determination of @xmath23 by hermes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a is one of the highlights of hera-1 , in spite of its limited precision .",
    "anticipated quality of @xmath25 extraction by the end of hera-2 in different fixed target experiments is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b .",
    "( 16.7,7.5)(0.1,0 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 7.9,-0.1 ) ( 6.2,6.4)(a ) ( 15.5,6.4)(b )    there are however two intrinsic problems with @xmath23 measurement at fixed target : a ) majority of gluons are concentrated below accessible @xmath7 range and b ) strong model dependence of the result , as higher scales are necessary for the reliable extraction of gluon polarization .",
    "additional advantage of higher energies is that several methods can be used to measure @xmath23 : from scaling violation of @xmath26 , from dijet events and - statistics permitting - from heavy quarks ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this motivates the use of the collider mode for such kind of measurements .",
    "two main possibilities for hera-3 have been investigated at previous workshops : lepton - nuclei collisions  @xcite and physics with polarized colliding beams  @xcite .",
    "they were recently summarized in  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that electron - deuteron scattering appears to be a natural next step following the @xmath28 running .",
    "it is not only a first part of @xmath0 programme , but also enables @xmath29 measurements , which is important on its own .",
    "moreover , due to the small anomalous magnetic moment of the deuteron the polarization is much easier to achieve with deuteron beam than with protons  @xcite .",
    "hence this option can unify `` spin '' and `` nuclear '' physics communities at hera-3 .      to summarize , the physics objective for hera-3 is to shed more light on the partonic structure of the neutron , on the nucleon spin decomposition ( especially at low @xmath7 and at high @xmath30 domains ) and on the problem of gluon saturation and confinement .",
    "in particular , is so called colour glass condensate  @xcite indeed a new form of matter in high energy limit of qcd ?",
    "key measurements in high energy @xmath0 collisions include the ratio @xmath31 , which is predicted to approach the black body limit of @xmath22 for large @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath32-dependence of the vector meson production , @xmath33 , is expected to change the behavior from colour transparency ( @xmath34 ) to colour opacity ( @xmath35 ) with decreasing @xmath7 .",
    "inclusive structure function should violate dglap : @xmath36 .",
    "these measurements at hera-3 will also be valuable to understand more complicated heavy ion collisions and could be important for lhc .    for polarized beams one would measure @xmath37 at low @xmath7 where it is essentially unknown .",
    "structure function @xmath38 can be for the first time determined from charged current asymmetries .",
    "dvcs will give access to the off - diagonal parton distributions at low @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to stress that the study of spin phenomena in this new kinematic domain will be enhanced by the comprehensive reconstruction of the final state possible in colliding beam experiments .",
    "typical measurements listed in previous subsection put definite requirements on the machine parameters . in case of polarized beams scattering most essential are high luminosity , @xmath39 pb@xmath4 , and beam polarization .",
    "this is because one typically measures very small asymmetries at low @xmath7 , or low cross sections at high @xmath30 . in case of proton beam one",
    "would need spin rotators , flattening snakes and at least four siberian snakes to maintain polarization .",
    "hence deuteron option looks very attractive , as there is good hope to use transverse rf dipoles to rotate and stabilize longitudinal polarization  @xcite and thus to avoid complicated siberian snake scheme .",
    "an open question is a high quality source of polarized deuterons .",
    "in contrast , expected effects and measured cross sections are large in @xmath0 collisions . hence moderate luminosity is sufficient : @xmath40 pb@xmath4/ion .",
    "low beam divergence is appreciated to minimize the @xmath41 smearing for elastically scattered and spectator nucleons .",
    "most complicated ingredient for this programme is electron cooling , which is required for @xmath42 nuclei in order to keep an acceptable life time of the ion beam .",
    "another interesting question which deserves additional studies is a possibility to fill and circulate different @xmath32 bunches simultaneously .",
    "this would reduce systematics in all measured @xmath32-dependencies drastically .",
    "( 16.7,7.0)(0.1,0 ) ( 0.0,0.0 ) ( 7.7,-0.5 )    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] hera is compared to other facilities and in particular to the eic  @xcite .",
    "the two projects are complementary both in the covered phase space and in the planned commissioning time .",
    "although the eic is superior in terms of anticipated luminosity it can use earlier hera-3 results to tune its physics programme .",
    "several options are possible of the experimental setup at hera-3 :    * retain existing setup : two colliding and one fixed target experiment ( h1 , zeus , hermes ) . this in addition would allow to continue fixed target spin programme at hera . * only one general purpose collider detector .",
    "this helps saving resources and concentrating efforts , and is also simpler for the machine tuning and stability . * two collider detectors optimized for different physics : low @xmath7 oriented  high acceptance , @xmath43-tagging capabilities , small beam divergence , and spin physics oriented  high @xmath44 , polarization , large statistics ( stronger focusing , no beam - line detectors ) .",
    "current evaluations show that main components of the present h1 and zeus detectors could be reused for hera-3 .",
    "some modifications in central tracking and electronics may be necessary .",
    "for @xmath0 programme an essential requirement is an efficient nucleon tagging capability . to study coherent diffraction @xmath45 large acceptance h1 vfps stations  @xcite at @xmath46 m from interaction region can be used .",
    "the existing forward neutron calorimeter  @xcite at @xmath47 m is important to distinguish central and peripheral @xmath0 collisions by the number of detected wounded and evaporated neutrons . finally , to select @xmath48 events in @xmath49 scattering a proton tagger with good @xmath50 resolution ( to distinguish spectators from elastically scattered protons ) has to be built and installed at around @xmath51 m .",
    "hera is so far a unique @xmath52 collider and its potential must be fully exploited .",
    "it is clear that even with high precision hera-2 data a number of fundamental questions in qcd will remain open .",
    "hera-3 can provide new information for at least three items of prime importance :    * what is the partonic structure of the neutron at low @xmath7 and at large @xmath53 ?",
    "* what is the origin of confinement , and how can qcd describe a regime of high parton density and weak coupling where cross sections ought to saturate ?",
    "* what is spin structure of the nucleon , especially at low @xmath7 ?",
    "since most of the infrastructure and the apparatus are in place such a programme can be realized with relatively moderate investments in three steps : @xmath54 collisions .",
    "the project is complementary to the planned future eic facility and may provide additional valuable information for the latter .",
