    "ternary systems based on iii - v semiconductors ( such as disordered alloys @xcite , heterostructures @xcite or quantum well systems @xcite ) have been the subject of wide scientific interest and of accurate theoretical studies , since they could be used as fundamental components in a large class of important devices ( laser diodes or infrared detectors , to name just a few ) @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we focus our attention on superlattices ( sl ) , whose structural , electronic and transport properties can be opportunely tuned by varying the constituent materials , the strain , the ordering direction or the layers thickness . to this end",
    ", we have examined the properties of interest in ultrathin [ 111 ] ordered sl , specifically in common - anion ( gasb)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 systems and in common - cation ( inas)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 systems , using the self - consistent all - electron flapw method within the density functional formalism .",
    "the systems considered here are now under experimental investigation ( results obtained for strained - layer insb / gasb quantum well @xcite , in@xmath1ga@xmath2sb / gasb heterostructures @xcite and inas@xmath2sb@xmath3 alloys @xcite have already been published ) ; at the present time , however , we are not yet able to compare our predicted results with experimental values regarding the sl .",
    "the appreciable mismatch between the lattice parameters of the binary constituents ( 5.7  @xmath4 in ( gasb)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 and 6.4  @xmath4 in ( inas)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 ) gives the opportunity to study the effects of the strain conditions on the sl electronic properties .",
    "in analogy with the common experimental approach @xcite we have considered various growth conditions for the sl , leading to different strain modes in the structure : ( i ) pseudomorphic growth on a substrate usually constituted by one of the binary constituents ( in which the lattice constant parallel to the growth plane is taken equal to that of the bulk semiconductor composing the substrate ) and ( ii ) a `` free standing mode '' ( fsm ) , in which no constraints are imposed on the bond - lengths , leading to relaxed lattice constants for the binary constituents , both different from their bulk values .",
    "the structural parameters for all of the structures considered have been chosen through total energy minimization or according to the macroscopic theory of elasticity ( mte ) @xcite .",
    "the choice made towards the [ 111 ] direction is encouraged by recent experimental observations @xcite that suggested the spontaneous ordering along this particular axis ( the so called cupt structure ) shown by some iii - v alloys during vapour - phase growth .",
    "the strong influence of the ordering direction on the sl electronic properties is immediately clear if we consider the ternary sl brillouin zones ( bz ) as obtained from the binary zincblende bz through folding operations , which are obviously different for [ 111 ] or [ 001 ] ordered systems ; the immediate consequence of this is a noticeable difference in the electronic properties .    in order to study the dependence of the electronic properties on the ordering direction",
    ", we have studied the common - anion and the common - cation systems in the three different growth conditions both in the cuau - like ( having [ 001 ] direction as growth axis ) and cupt - like structure .    following the model proposed by wei and zunger @xcite",
    ", we consider the sl as obtained first from an ideal virtual crystal ( a common - anion ( common - cation ) system having the cation ( anion ) with intermediate properties between the two cations relative to the binary constituents ) .",
    "we then introduce a perturbative potential , having a structural part ( due to atomic displacements and relaxation due to epitaxial strain ) and a chemical one ( due to the electronegativity difference between the constituent atoms ) .    in order to separate the effects due to the two different terms in the expression of the potential ,",
    "we have studied strained ( ac)@xmath0/(ac)@xmath0-type systems ideally obtained by monolayer deposition of the same binary constituent ( ac ) along the [ 111 ] direction , in which the two different ac bond - lengths are equal to those in the equivalent ( ac)@xmath0/(bc)@xmath0 sl .",
    "we will discuss the results obtained in this work as follows : first of all , we will briefly expose the computational details and parameters used in the calculations ( section ii ) ; in section iii our structural results will be reported for all the different systems considered . in section iv we will discuss the electronic properties of the sl , with particular attention to the quantities of technological interest ( such as energy band - gaps and crystal field splittings ) and their dependence on growth direction , atomic substitution and strain conditions .",
    "we will also discuss the charge density distribution and in particular the localization of the charge carriers in the different constituents sublattices .",
    "section v summarizes our main results and draws some conclusions .",
    "we have determined the properties of the structures considered using the density functional formalism , within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite exchange and correlation potential as parametrized by hedin - lundqvist @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed using the _ ab initio _ all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method ( flapw ) @xcite .",
    "core electrons as well as valence ones are treated using a self - consistent procedure ; the shallow ga @xmath5 and in @xmath6 states are considered as valence states , for which scalar - relativistic effects are included in the self - consistent calculation , whereas spin - orbit effects are treated in a perturbative approach . for",
    "[ 111 ] ordered systems , angular momenta up to @xmath7 = 6 in the muffin tin spheres ( with radius @xmath8 = 2.4 a.u . for all the constituents atoms ) and plane waves with wave vector up to @xmath9 = 3.3 a.u . are used , leading to about 600 basis functions .    to perform integrations in reciprocal space , a set of four special * k",
    "* points is chosen in the trigonal brillouin zone ( bz ) , following the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite .",
    "similar values for these computational parameters have been used for [ 001 ] ordered systems , with the only exceptions represented by @xmath7 = 8 and a set of three special * k * points used for the integration over the tetragonal brillouin zone .",
    "finally , the broyden @xcite method is used to accelerate the convergence in the self - consistent iterations .",
    "the atomic ordering along the [ 111 ] direction of a sl grown on a ( 111 ) substrate gives origin to a trigonal bravais lattice with @xmath10 ( schenflies notation ) space group @xcite .",
    "the unit cell in real space contains 4 atoms and the origin is taken on a cation site @xcite .",
    "the free structural parameters are determined following the macroscopic theory of elasticity ( mte ) @xcite , taking into account the elastic properties of the constituent materials , and then compared with those obtained through total energy minimization .",
    "we observe that in each cell , there are two atoms belonging to the same chemical species ( the two sb anions in the ( gasb)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 systems and the two in cations in the ( inas)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 systems ) , which are not equivalent from the coordination point of view . as an example",
    ", we consider the particular case of ( gasb)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 sl , having the first sb@xmath11 bound with three ga and one in , and the second sb@xmath12 showing a complementary situation .",
    "the total energy minimization procedure that considers all the free parameters in the unit cell as different degrees of freedom is a very onerous computational problem ; this encouraged some simplifications , such as considering equal bond lengths between equal atomic species ( _ i.e. , _ in the common - anion system , we have chosen @xmath13 ) , thus reducing to three the number of degrees of freedom ( in - plane lattice parameter and two different bond - lengths ) .",
    "although this simplification is frequently used in total energy minimization @xcite , one should be aware that this approximation results in considering an average over the two different local environments and therefore that the real elastic structures may slightly differ from our optimized sls .",
    "according to mte , using the same notation as in ref.@xcite , the structural parameters for the epilayer are determined as follows : @xmath14 } \\:\\left(\\frac{a_{\\parallel}}{a^{epi}}-1 \\right)\\right]\\\\                     \\label{d111 } d^{[111 ] } & = & 2\\ : \\left ( \\frac{c_{11}+2\\:c_{12}-2\\:c_{44}}{c_{11}+2\\ : c_{12}+4\\:c_{44 } } \\right)\\\\ \\nonumber \\epsilon^{epi}_{\\parallel } & = & \\frac{a_{\\parallel}}{a^{epi}}-1 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\epsilon^{epi}_{\\perp } & = & \\frac{a_{\\perp}^{epi}}{a^{epi}}-1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are the elastic constants for the bulk epilayer ( we have used the experimental values reported in ref.@xcite ) .    through total energy minimization of the `` ideal '' ( ac)@xmath0/(bc)@xmath0 unrelaxed structures ( in which all the atoms are arranged in a zincblende structure with lattice constant @xmath16 -  our free parameter  - and with bond - lengths @xmath17 ) , we have found an in - plane lattice constant very close to the average of the bulk constituents , according to vegard s rule .",
    "we have thus examined a free standing mode structure ( indicated in the following as elastically relaxed or simply er ) , that has this value for the in - plane lattice constant . in table",
    "[ parstruttan ] and table [ parstruttcat ] we report the calculated structural parameters for the ternary common - anion and common - cation systems : the s1 ( s2 ) system is a common - anion sl grown on a gasb ( insb ) substrate , while the s3 ( s4 ) system is a common - cation sl grown on an inas ( insb ) substrate .    in the case of pseudomorphic growth on a substrate ,",
    "we have found general agreement between the structures obtained through total energy minimization and those given by mte ; this fully justifies our having considered this approximation to determine the five unknown parameters in the free standing mode ( fsm ) structure .",
    "note that deviations from the results predicted by mte occur in the case of insb strained to gasb or to inas ; in both these structures , total energy minimization gives an insb bond - length that is systematically larger ( within 0.6 @xmath4 ) than the one expected according to mte , even though the difference between the total energies for the elastic sl and for the total energy minimal structures is very small ( barely larger than the numerical uncertainty of 1 mry / unit cell ) .",
    "however , this can be justified considering that , due to its elastic properties , this material could easily be out of the linear elastic region .",
    "in fact , the elastic constants for insb are quite smaller than those for gasb and inas @xcite , resulting in a larger effective strain -  due to the mismatch  - in the former case ; this is also confirmed by the non - linear behaviour of the band - gap as a function of the strain , as will be discussed later .",
    "as expected from the similarity of the gasb and inas elastic constants @xcite and bulk moduli ( the experimental values are @xmath18 = 0.579 mb and @xmath19 = 0.578 mb @xcite ) , we obtain similar deformations for these two constituents respectively in the common - anion and common - cation sls .",
    "we also notice that strains ( either parallel or perpendicular ) and percentage deviations from bulk bond - lengths are more pronounced in the common - cation systems , compared to the common - anion systems : this is obviously a consequence of the greater mismatch between the constituent lattice parameters in the ( inas)@xmath0/(insb)@xmath0 structures .    in the case of [ 001 ] ordered systems ( whose",
    "structural parameters are reported in table [ parstruttan ] and table [ parstruttcat ] respectively for common - anion and common - cation sl ) , we obtain a tetragonal bravais lattice with @xmath20 space group @xcite and a unit cell in real space with 4 atoms ( two of which are equivalent ) ; the origin is taken on a cation ( anion ) site for the common - anion ( common - cation ) system .",
    "the mte relations reported in eqs.([d111 ] ) are still valid for [ 001 ] ordered sl , if the parameter @xmath21 is redefined as : @xmath22 } = 2\\ : \\left ( \\frac{c_{12}}{c_{11 } } \\right ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ]    a comparison between the [ 111 ] and [ 001 ] ordered structures ( having the same chemical composition ) shows that in the same growth conditions ( fsm or growth on a substrate ) the structural parameters are not equal .",
    "in particular we notice larger perpendicular strains in the [ 001 ] compared to the [ 111 ] ordered structures , while the parallel strains are obviously equal in considering the same growth conditions ; what we find is thus a smaller deviation from bulk bond - lengths , due to a more effective relaxation .",
    "the determination of the sl electronic energy levels is a fundamental point for most of the properties of interest in the systems considered . in table",
    "[ sllivris ] we report the calculated electronic levels ( with a numerical uncertainty of @xmath23  0.04  ev , equal for all the energies reported in the present work , unless otherwise specified ) at the bz center ( @xmath24 ) , for the different [ 111 ] ordered systems considered ( free standing mode and pseudomorphic growth on the two substrates ) , both for the common - anion and for the common - cation systems .",
    "we also report the zincblende state from which the sl state derives through folding the f.c.c .",
    "brillouin zone back into the smaller ternary trigonal zone .",
    "the splitting , @xmath25 , of the triply degenerate @xmath26 zincblende state is due to the non - cubic crystal field and is conventionally taken positive if the doubly degenerate state @xmath27 has a higher energy compared to the state @xmath28 . as can be seen from table [ sllivris ]",
    ", we obtain a negative @xmath25 in the case of gasb ( inas ) strained to insb for common - anion ( cation ) systems - corresponding to an in - plane extensive strain @xmath29 - whereas the complementary case ( pseudomorphic growth on a gasb - substrate ( inas - substrate ) ) and the free standing mode produce a positive @xmath25 .",
    "the introduction of spin - orbit coupling removes the double degeneracy of the @xmath27 state and yields the electronic energy levels illustrated in fig.[elenlev ] as a function of the substrate lattice constant .",
