    "banados , silk and west ( bsw ) recently pointed out that the kerr black hole can act as a particle accelerator@xcite : two particles dropped in from infinity at rest , traveling along the timelike geodesics can collide with arbitrarily large energy at their center of mass frame , if the kerr black hole is extremely spinning and orbital angular momentum of one of the particles takes a specific fine - tuned value .",
    "then , the possible astrophysical implications of this process around the event horizon of the central supermassive black hole in the context of annihilations of the dark matter particles accreted from the galactic halo were investigated @xcite .",
    "the bsw process of particle acceleration suffers from several drawbacks and limitations pointed out in @xcite : such as for example , a fine - tuning of the orbital angular momenta of the particles , a neglect of the self - gravity of particles in their analysis , and an upper bound on the spin of the kerr black hole formed in our universe@xcite .",
    "there were many investigations of this acceleration mechanism in the background of kerr as well as many other black holes@xcite .",
    "two of the present authors , mp and psj ( pj ) , pointed out the other possibility .",
    "particle collisions with arbitrarily large energy at the center of mass frame may occur in the naked singular kerr spacetime if the total angular momentum of the central naked singularity is very close to the critical value@xcite .",
    "this mechanism is physically rather different from the bsw process . in the case of the bsw process ,",
    "one of the two particles asymptotically approaches the event horizon by virtue of its special value of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "since the event horizon is generated by the outward null geodesics , the world line of the particle asymptotically becomes outward null .",
    "hence , the relative velocity between this particle and another particle falling to the kerr black hole can be very large . as a result",
    ", the center of mass energy of the collision between these particles can be arbitrarily large .",
    "by contrast , in the case of the pj process , one of the two particles falls inward but eventually turns to outward due to the repulsive nature of the naked singularity or due to the centrifugal potential .",
    "then , it can collide with another particle falling inward . in this mechanism , the large relative velocity between these two particles at the collision event can be achieved by virtue of the deep gravitational potential of the almost extreme naked singular geometry .    like the bsw process , the pj process of particle acceleration also would have certain drawbacks and limitations .",
    "as in the case of bsw s analysis , the self - gravities of the particles are neglected in pj s analysis , and it is unclear whether the naked singular kerr geometry appears in our universe@xcite . however , in the case of the pj process , no fine - tuning of the orbital angular momenta of the colliding particles is necessary .",
    "the issue of the self - gravity of the point particles is difficult to deal with in general .",
    "if the effects of self - gravity and gravitational radiation are important in a collision between elementary particles , such a collision process must be described by the quantum gravity : the gravitational interaction between elementary particles is to be necessarily quantum in nature .",
    "hence , even if bsw or pj analysis does not predict accurately the high energy collision of the elementary particles , their result implies that collisions of elementary particles with the center of mass energy high enough to cause quantum gravitational interactions may occur in the kerr spacetime .",
    "however , it is a fascinating primary question what happens when the center of mass energy of a collision becomes comparable to the total mass of the system within the framework of general relativity .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to treat analytically the motion of matter in the kerr spacetime , if we will take into account the effect of their self - gravity .",
    "hence , it is worthwhile to notice that the similar processes to both of the bsw and pj processes may occur in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime@xcite : it is much easier than the case of the kerr spacetime to treat analytically the motion of matter in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime by virtue of its spherical symmetry . in the case of a process similar to the bsw one , a particle with charge of the same sign as that of the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole radially falls toward the black hole from infinity . if the charge of the particle is equal to its mass , the particle",
    "asymptotically approaches the event horizon .",
    "after the charged particle starts to fall , another neutral particle also starts a radial fall toward the black hole from infinity .",
    "then , it eventually overtakes and collides with the charged particle previously falling .",
    "the closer to the event horizon the collision event is , the higher will be its energy at their center of mass frame , and arbitrarily large collision energy is in principle possible .",
    "by contrast , in the case of the process similar to pj s one , two radially moving neutral particles can collide with arbitrarily large energy at their center of mass frame .",
    "one of the two particles falls inward from infinity and eventually turns back outwards due to the repulsive nature of the central naked singularity .",
    "then it collides with another particle which starts to fall towards the naked singularity after the first particle have started .",
    "the very large collision energy is possible due to the deep gravitational potential of almost extreme central naked singularity , like in the case of the naked singular kerr spacetime .",
    "a system of concentric spherical shells with infinitesimal width in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime is very useful to study the effect of the self - gravity in the bsw and pj processes , since their dynamical degrees of freedom are finite and hence the system is tractable analytically .",
    "the stress - energy tensor diverges on the shells , since finite energy and momentum concentrate on the infinitesimally thin domains .",
    "this means that these shells are categorized into the so - called curvature polynomial singularity@xcite through the einstein equations",
    ". since each shell has finite mass and momentum , the volume integral of the stress - energy tensor is finite : the components of the stress - energy tensor are distributional sources of einstein s equations . here",
    "we should note that the distributional source is a technical simplification usually adopted in theoretical study of gravitational physics .",
    "for example , in the framework of newtonian gravity , massive point particles are useful idealization to study the celestial mechanics , although real stars have finite sizes . by this idealization ,",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom of the system become finite , and as a result , the analysis is very easy .",
    "if the size of each star is much smaller than the size of the system , this point - particle approximation will give sufficiently accurate prediction about their orbits .",
    "the divergences of the gravitational potential and the gravitational force just at the point particle are artificial due to this technical idealization , and the gravity of each star is assumed to be so small that the newtonian approximation is valid .",
    "by contrast , in the framework of general relativity , the point - particle approximation is impossible , since the point particle is so seriously singular that the spacetime metric can not be defined on it .",
    "however the thin - shell approximation is possible even in the framework of general relativity , since the metric is defined on the infinitesimally thin shell even though the stress - energy tensor diverges on it .",
    "we can derive the equation of motion for the shell which is consistent with the einstein equations by the so - called israel formalism@xcite .",
    "if the shell is highly symmetric ( e.g. spherically symmetric ) , the degrees of freedom becomes finite , and as a result , the analysis is very easy .",
    "the divergence of the ricci tensor at the shell is artificial due to this technical simplification .",
    "the thin - shell approximation is valid if the width of the shell is much smaller than the size of the system .",
    "two of the present authors , mk , kn , and their collaborator , tagoshi , studied the collision between two concentric spherical dust shells in the reissner - nordstrm black hoke geometry ; one of the two shells has a charge , whereas another is neutral .",
    "this example corresponds to the spherical shell version of the bsw process . by virtue of the spherical symmetry",
    ", they treated this system exactly and showed that the effect of the self - gravity makes the collision energy finite as long as we focus on the collision event observable for distant observers .",
    "then , the present authors investigated the collision between two concentric neutral spherical dust shells in the naked singular reissner - nordstrm geometry@xcite : this example corresponds to the spherical shell version of the pj process .",
    "they showed that the upper bound on the energy of the collision between the shells appears due to the self - gravity of the shells also in this case as long as we focus on the collision event observable for the distant observers .",
    "but , the energy of the collision between two of the constituent particles of these shells can still exceed the planck scale . furthermore , in the case of the naked singular geometry , the timescale to occur",
    "the high - energy collision may be much shorter than the case that corresponds to the bsw process@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a collision between two concentric infinitesimally thin spherical shells made up of dust particles in a situation of no black hole and no naked singularity , taking into account their self - gravity exactly .",
    "the domain inside the inner shell is described by the minkowskian geometry , whereas the outside of it is described by the over - charged reissner - nordstrm geometry .",
    "the outer shell may or may not have charge , but the outside of it is assumed to be also described by the over - charged reissner - nordstrm geometry .",
    "even in this situation , very high energy collision between two of the constituent particles of these shells through a similar mechanism to the pj process may occur , since the domain between these shells is described by the naked singular reissner - nordstrm geometry .",

    "the necessary condition to achieve the high energy is that the collision occurs at @xmath180 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the charge and mass parameters of the reissner - nordstrm geometry between these shells .",
    "it is important fact that the inner over - charged shell can shrink to @xmath181 if the initial inward velocity of the inner shell at infinity exceed a small threshold value .",
    "furthermore , the inner shell can shrink to an arbitrarily small radius : we can see from eq .",
    "( [ t - point ] ) that , in the limit @xmath182 , the radius of the turning point @xmath183 vanishes .",
    "this means that even if no naked singularity forms , a domain described by the over - charged reissner - nordstrm geometry arbitrarily close to the naked singularity may appear as a transient phenomenon .",
    "the physical phenomena similar to the pj process may occur in such a domain , even though no naked singularity forms .",
    "as mentioned , the infinitesimally thin shell is a technical simplification .",
    "although the stress - energy tensor of the shell diverges , this prescription is based on the assumption that the self - gravity of each constituent particle of the thin shells is negligible : the local dynamics of each particle is described in the framework of the special relativity . however ,",
    "if the collision energy of the particles at the center of mass frame exceeds the planck scale , the colliding particles will make the spacetime highly curved , and black holes may form . their motions after ultra - high energy collision can not be described in the framework of the special relativity .",
    "this means that the motion of the shells after the collision is highly non - trivial problem , but this issue is out of the scope of this article .",
