    "a star is weakly charged if the increase in electrostatic energy upon rotating an arm half - way towards any nearest neighbor does not significantly exceed the typical thermal energy @xmath9 at temperature @xmath10 . in stars not satisfying this criterion , electrostatic interactions overwhelm brownian motion and the arms are orientationally frozen .    to model pair interactions ,",

    "the electrostatic interaction between two arms , one oriented along a unit vector @xmath12 in a star centered at the origin , the other oriented along @xmath13 in a star centered at @xmath11 , is then approximated by an effective pair potential @xmath14 is the proton charge , the summation goes over all the charged beads of the two arms , and @xmath15 is the debye screening constant ( inverse debye screening length ) . for a solution with star number density @xmath16 , salt ion pair number density @xmath17 , and salt valence @xmath18 ,",

    "repulsive forces between arms on different stars exert torques that rotate the arms back , creating anisotropy in the arm distribution . opposing this backward rotation , repulsions between arms on the same star exert torques that spread out the arms , favoring isotropy .",
    "likewise , random thermal ( brownian ) rotational motion acts to even out the arm distribution . to calculate the equilibrium arm distribution , and the corresponding star - star interaction energy , we use three independent methods , described in the next section",

    "electrostatic forces between arms generate torques that drive the arms to rotate against the friction of the solvent .",
    "since the terminal angular velocity of an arm is proportional to the torque exerted on that arm , the equation of motion is  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the arm s moment of inertia and rotational friction coefficient , respectively .",

    "the interactions between overlapping stars are attributed largely to entropy of trapped counterions , electrostatics playing only a relatively minor role  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the coarse - grained one - component model , where the microions are integrated out in a first step to obtain effective ( screened - coulomb ) arm - arm interactions , electrostatics is the sole determiner of effective star - star interactions .",
    "thus , the entropy of trapped counterions , which in the molecular model is explicitly associated with the distribution of counterions around the arms of the stars , has its coarse - grained counterpart in the implicit contribution of counterions to the effective star valence and to the effective interactions via the debye screening constant . although the correspondence between the two models has been tested here using the available md data for 10-arm and 30-arm stars [ fig .",
    "[ feff ] ] , it should be tested more extensively in future , especially over a broader range of star functionality .",
    "third , the pe stars considered here belong to a class of macromolecules for which chain entropy is negligible . since we model the arms as charged rigid rods , and ignore excluded - volume interactions between arms , the effective pair interactions vanish in the limit of charge - neutral stars . for stars with flexible arms , witten and pincus  @xcite and likos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that conformational entropy of the arms generates an effective  ultrasoft \" repulsion between neutral stars , which varies logarithmically with distance at small separations and follows a yukawa form at longer separations .",
    "such entropic interactions are here neglected .",
    "in summary , within a coarse - grained model of polyelectrolyte stars , we have analyzed arm orientational anisotropy and effective interactions between an isolated pair of weakly charged ( orientationally molten ) stars .",
    "the arms of the stars were modeled as rigid rods , freely rotating about the star centers , and carrying evenly spaced charged beads .",
    "microions were included implicitly by modeling electrostatic interactions between pairs of charged beads via an effective screened - coulomb ( yukawa ) potential .",
    "arm orientational distribution functions and effective star - star electrostatic interactions were calculated by three independent methods : monte carlo simulation , torque balance analysis , and density - functional theory .    the arm orientational distributions predicted by dft are in good agreement with simulation for nonoverlapping stars of relatively low effective valence . with increasing overlap and increasing valence",
    ", the agreement worsens due to the theory s neglect of arm - arm correlations and interdigitation .",
    "an orientational order parameter , quantifying the extent of anisotropy , increases as two stars approach each other , peaks at strong overlap , and then decreases as the stars near complete overlap .",
    "the simulation and dft results for the effective pair potential between nonoverlapping stars are in excellent agreement with previous predictions of linear response theory applied to a continuum model of pe stars with isotropic @xmath0 charge distribution  @xcite .",
    "this close agreement results not only from the relatively weak anisotropy of separated stars , but also from a fortuitous cancellation between reduced inter - star interactions and enhanced intra - star interactions induced by arm anisotropy .",
    "we conclude that electrostatic interactions between nonoverlapping weakly charged pe stars can be accurately modeled by a simple yukawa effective pair potential .",
    "the effective pair potentials from our monte carlo simulations and dft calculations are in good agreement over the whole range of star separations , including strongly overlapping stars , for the parameters here investigated .",
    "furthermore , treating the effective valence of the stars as a fitting parameter , we achieve a close fit to available data for the effective pair forces and numbers of condensed counterions from md simulations  @xcite of a molecular model with flexible bead - spring chains and explicit counterions .",
    "simulations of many - star systems are a natural next step . for dilute solutions ,",
    "interactions between isolated pairs of nonoverlapping stars can be reliably approximated , as confirmed here , by an isotropic screened - coulomb pair potential  @xcite .",
    "only interactions between overlapping stars must then be computed by explicit summation over pairs of charged beads , pending an analytical fit to our mc data . for concentrated solutions of frequently overlapping stars ,",
    "arm anisotropy and many - body interactions among three or more stars are likely to be important . in this regime ,",
    "explicit pairwise summation over beads is essential .",
