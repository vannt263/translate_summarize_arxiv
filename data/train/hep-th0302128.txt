    "recently there has been growing evidence for the existence of a condensate of mass dimension two in @xmath1 yang - mills theory with @xmath3 colours . an obvious candidate for such",
    "a condensate is @xmath4 .",
    "the phenomenological background of this type of condensate can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , if one first considers simpler models such as massless @xmath5 theory or the gross - neveu model @xcite and the role played by their quartic interaction in the formation of a ( local ) composite quadratic condensate and the consequent _ dynamical mass generation _ for the originally massless fields @xcite , it is clear that the _ possibility _ exists that the quartic gluon interaction gives rise to a quadratic composite operator condensate in yang mills theory and hence a dynamical mass for the gluons .",
    "the formation of such a dynamical mass is strongly correlated to a lower value of the vacuum energy .",
    "in other words the causal perturbative yang mills vacuum is unstable . from this viewpoint , mass generation in connection with gluon pairing",
    "has already been discussed a long time ago in , for example , @xcite . there the analogy with the bcs superconductor and its gap equation was examined .",
    "it was shown that the zero vacuum is tachyonic in nature and the gluons achieve a mass due to a non - trivial solution of the gap equation .",
    "moreover , recent work using lattice regularized yang mills theory has indicated the existence of a non - zero condensate , @xmath6 , @xcite . there",
    "the authors invoked the operator product expansion , ( ope ) , on the gluon propagator as well as on the effective coupling @xmath7 in the landau gauge .",
    "their work was based on the perception that , even in the relatively high energy region ( @xmath8gev ) , a discrepancy existed between the expected perturbative behaviour and the lattice results .",
    "it was shown that , within the momentum range accessible to the ope , that this discrepancy could be solved with a @xmath9 power correction power correction due to the @xmath10 condensate is too weak at such energies to be the cause of the discrepancy . ] .",
    "they concluded that a non - vanishing dimension two condensate must exist .",
    "further , the results of @xcite give some evidence that instantons might be the mechanism behind the low - momentum contribution to condensate .",
    "as has been argued in @xcite , only the low - momentum content of the squared vector potential is accessible with the ope .",
    "moreover , they argue that there are also _ short - distance _ non - perturbative contributions to @xmath11 .",
    "it is no coincidence the landau gauge is used for the search for a dimension two condensate .",
    "naively , the operator @xmath12 is not gauge - invariant .",
    "although this does not prevent the condensate @xmath13 showing up in gauge variant quantities like the gluon propagator , we should instead consider the gauge - invariant operator @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the space - time volume and @xmath16 is an arbitrary gauge transformation in order to assign some physical meaning to the operator .",
    "clearly from its structure this operator is non - local and thus is difficult to handle .",
    "however , when we impose the landau gauge , it reduces can be given a gauge invariant meaning . in another gauge",
    ", the bubbles will no longer correspond to @xmath13 and the correspondence with @xmath17 is more of academic interest . ] to the local operator @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that @xmath18 is ( on - shell ) brst invariant @xcite .",
    "another motivation for studying @xmath13 is the perceived connection between the gluon propagator and confinement .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein . )",
    "more precisely , the gluon propagator exhibits an infrared suppression , as has been reported in many lattice simulations , @xcite and using the schwinger - dyson approach , @xcite . a dynamical gluon mass might serve as an indication for such a suppression .",
    "an attempt has already been made to explain confinement by a dual ginzburg - landau model or an effective string theory , in the landau gauge , with the help of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath18 might be central to confinement , is supported by the observation that it undergoes a phase transition due to the monopole condensation in three dimensional compact qed @xcite .    from these various analyses",
    "the importance of @xmath18 must have become clear .",
    "therefore , the aim of this article is to provide some _ analytical _ evidence that gluons do condense . to our knowledge",
    ", @xcite is the only paper which effectively calculates @xmath19 , without referring to lattice regularization . in @xcite the standard way of calculating the effective potential for a particular quantity",
    "was followed , and all the problems concerning the fact that the considered quantity was a composite operator were elegantly solved .    in a previous paper @xcite , we have discussed the @xmath20 expansion for the gross - neveu model and found results close to the exact values for the gross - neveu mass gap and the vacuum energy .",
    "the @xmath20 expansion does not rely on the effective action formalism of @xcite .",
    "instead it is directly based on the path integral and the topology of its feynman diagrammatical expansion . in this paper",
    "we will discuss how to apply it to @xmath1 yang - mills theories in the landau gauge .",
    "of course , it is not our aim to provide a complete picture of @xmath13 but rather give further evidence for its existence since it lowers the vacuum energy .",
    "the @xmath1 yang mills lagrangian in @xmath21-dimensional euclidean space time is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gluon field strength , @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath25 @xmath27 , @xmath28 implements the landau gauge and its corresponding faddeev - popov part and @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the ghosts and anti - ghost fields respectively .",
    "issues concerning the counterterm part of ( [ 1 ] ) will be discussed later .",
    "first , we consider the diagrammatical expansion for the vacuum energy which we denote by @xmath31 . as is well known , this is a series consisting of one particle irreducible , @xmath32 , diagrams .",
    "these @xmath33 diagrams can be divided into two disjoint classes :    * those diagrams not falling apart into two separate pieces when two lines meeting at the same point @xmath34 are cut , which we call 2-point - particle - irreducible , ( @xmath20 ) ; ( an example is given in fig .",
    "1 ) * those diagrams falling apart into two separate pieces when two lines meeting at the same point @xmath34 are cut which we call 2-point - particle - reducible , ( @xmath35 ) , while @xmath34 is called the @xmath35 insertion point ; ( an example is given in fig .",
    "2 ) .    [ fig1 ]",
    "we may now resum this series of @xmath35 and @xmath20 graphs , where the propagators are the usual massless ones , by retaining only the @xmath20 graphs , whereby the @xmath35 insertions , or bubbles , are resummed into an effective @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "the bubble graph gluon polarization is then given by @xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are the @xmath1 structure constants .",
    "we define the vacuum expectation value of @xmath12 as @xmath40 the global @xmath1 symmetry can then be used to show that @xmath41 substitution of ( [ 4 ] ) in ( [ 2 ] ) yields @xmath42 which results in an effective mass , @xmath43 , running in the @xmath20 propagators , given by @xmath44 if we let @xmath45 be the sum of the @xmath20 vacuum bubbles , calculated with the effective @xmath20 propagator , then this @xmath45 is _ not _ equal to the vacuum energy @xmath31 , because simply removing all @xmath35 insertions is too naive .",
    "for instance , there is a double counting problem which is already visible in the @xmath35 diagram of fig . 2 where each bubble can be seen as a @xmath35 insertion on the other one .",
    "however , we can resolve this ambiguity . a dimensional argument results in @xmath46 where @xmath47 will accomodate the double counting .",
    "to determine the appropriate value of @xmath48 , we use the path integral which gives @xmath49 the first two terms contribute unambiguously to the @xmath20 part . for the last term , we rewrite @xmath50 using ( [ 4 ] ) and the properties of the structure constants @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath51 from ( [ 7 ] ) , we derive @xmath52 combining ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) gives @xmath53 then a simple diagrammatical argument gives @xmath54 which is a local gap equation , summing the bubble graphs into @xmath55 . using this together with ( [ 12 ] )",
    "finally gives @xmath56 it is easy to show that the following equivalence holds @xmath57 to summarize , we have summed the bubble insertions into an effective @xmath36 , @xmath55 .",
    "the vacuum energy is expressed by @xmath58 we stress the fact that ( [ 15 ] ) is _ only meaningful if _ the gap equation ( [ 16 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this means we can not consider @xmath43 or @xmath59 as a real variable on which @xmath31 depends .",
    "it is a quantity which has to obey its gap equation , otherwise the @xmath20 expansion loses its validity .",
    "this also means that @xmath60 , or equivalently @xmath61 , is not a function depending on @xmath43 ( @xmath59 ) , in contrast also makes sense if @xmath62 . ] with the usual concept of an effective potential @xmath63 which is a function of the constant field @xmath64 .    in order to ensure the usefulness of the @xmath20 formalism for actual calculations , we should prove it can be fully renormalized with the counterterms available from the original ( bare ) lagrangian , ( [ 1 ] ) . however , it is sufficient to say that all our derived formulae remain valid and are finite when the counterterms are included .",
    "this also implies the @xmath20 mass @xmath43 is renormalized and gives rise to a finite , physical mass is the pole of the gluon propagator .",
    "] , @xmath65 . furthermore",
    ", no new counterterms are needed to remove the vacuum energy divergences .",
    "the renormalizability of the @xmath20 expansion has been discussed in detail in @xcite in the case of the gross - neveu model .",
    "since the arguments for yang mills theory are completely analogous , we refer to @xcite for technical details concerning the renormalization .",
    "another point worth emphasising here , is the renormalization group equation , ( rge ) , for @xmath31 .",
    "the first diagram of @xmath45 is given by the o - bubble . using the @xmath66 renormalization scheme in dimensional regularization in @xmath21 dimensions , we find @xmath67 since @xmath31 is a physical quantity , it should not depend on the subtraction scale @xmath68 .",
    "this is expressed by the rge @xmath69 where @xmath70 governs the scaling behaviour of the coupling constant @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the anomalous dimension of @xmath55 @xmath73 the coefficients can be found in @xcite for @xmath74 and in @xcite for @xmath75 , @xmath76\\left ( { \\frac}{n}{16\\pi^{2}}\\right)^{3 } ~. \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when we combine all this information and determine @xmath77 up to lowest order in @xmath78 , we find @xmath79 apparently , it seems that @xmath31 does not obey its rge",
    ". however , this is not a contradiction because of the demand that the gap equation ( [ 16 ] ) _ must _ be satisfied .",
    "the gap equation implies that @xmath80 .",
    "the consequence is that all leading logarithms contain terms of order unity .",
    "hence , we can not show that the rge for @xmath31 is obeyed order by order .",
    "the same phenomenon extends to higher orders . in other words ,",
    "knowledge of @xmath81 up to a certain order @xmath82 , would require knowledge of _ all _ leading and subleading log terms to order @xmath82 , to show explicitly that @xmath81  @xmath83  @xmath84 .",
    "we must therefore be careful not to interpret the non - vanishing of the rge as a reason to introduce a `` non - perturbative '' @xmath85-function , as is sometimes done , @xcite .",
    "[ fig3 ]    up to 2-loop order in the @xmath20 expansion ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , we find in the @xmath86 scheme @xmath87\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the riemann zeta function , @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the clausen function .",
    "we have computed the relevant two loop vacuum bubble diagrams to the finite part using the massive gluon and massless ghost propagators which are respectively @xmath91 ~~~~~ \\mbox{and } ~~~~~ \\frac{1}{p^{2}}\\ ] ] in the landau gauge .",
    "the expressions for the general massive and massless two loop bubble integrals were derived from the results of @xcite and implemented in the symbolic manipulation language form , @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that solving the gap equation @xmath92  @xmath83  @xmath84 , with @xmath93 set equal to @xmath94 to kill potentially large logarithms , gives no solution at 1-loop or 2-loop , apart from the trivial one @xmath95  @xmath83  @xmath84 .",
    "this does not imply @xmath13 does not exist but that the @xmath86 scheme might not be the best choice for the @xmath20 expansion . to address this",
    "we first remove the freedom existing in how the mass parameter @xmath59 is renormalized by replacing @xmath59 by a renormalization scheme and scale independent quantity @xmath96 .",
    "this can be accommodated by scheme , otherwise any other massless renormalization scheme is meant . ]",
    "@xmath97 with @xmath98 a change in massless renormalization scheme corresponds to relations of the form @xmath99 with these , it is easily checked that ( [ 24 ] ) is renormalization scheme and scale independent .",
    "the explicit solution of ( [ 25 ] ) reads @xmath100+\\mathcal{o}\\left({\\overline{g}}^{6}\\right)\\right\\ } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the gap equation is still a series expansion in @xmath101 and we hope to find ( at least qualitatively ) acceptable results , @xmath101 should be small .",
    "we will therefore choose to renormalize the coupling constant in such a scheme so that @xmath31 is of the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 otherwise , we remove all the terms of the form @xmath104 , and only keep the terms that contain a power of the logarithm @xmath105 .",
    "this is always possible by calculating the @xmath86 value of @xmath31 as in ( [ 23 ] ) and using ( [ 26a ] ) to change the coupling constant renormalization by a suitable choice for the coefficients @xmath106 . in other words",
    "the 1-loop @xmath86 contribution to @xmath31 allows one to determine @xmath107 .",
    "once @xmath107 is fixed , the 2-loop @xmath86 contribution to @xmath31 can be used to fix @xmath108 , and so on for the higher order contributions .",
    "we note that the gap equation ( [ 16 ] ) is translated into @xmath109  @xmath83  @xmath84 since @xmath110 . in this gap equation",
    ", we will set @xmath93  @xmath83  @xmath111 so that all logarithms vanish .",
    "in other words @xmath105  @xmath83  @xmath84 .",
    "notice that one can not set @xmath93  @xmath83  @xmath111 in the expression ( [ e1 ] ) and use the rge for @xmath31 to sum the logarithms when @xmath112 is solved .",
    "as already explained in the previous section , the rge for @xmath31 is not obeyed order by order , see also @xcite .",
    "once a solution @xmath113 of the gap equation is found , then we will always have @xmath114 if the constructed value for @xmath101 is small enough , then we can trust , at least qualitatively , the results we will obtain .",

    "constant is @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the scale parameter of the corresponding massless renormalization scheme .",
    "we will express everything in terms of the @xmath86 scale parameter @xmath121 . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that @xmath122 we will also derive a value for the @xmath123 condensate from the trace anomaly @xmath124 this anomaly allows us to deduce for @xmath3  @xmath83  @xmath125 the following relation between the vacuum energy and the gluon condensate @xmath126 at 1-loop order , the results for @xmath3  @xmath83  @xmath125 are @xmath127 while the scale parameter @xmath128 .",
    "we have used @xmath121  @xmath129  @xmath130 which was the value reported in @xcite .",
    "we see that the 1-loop expansion parameter is quite large and we conclude that we should go to the next order where the situation is improved .",
    "we find @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "although there is a sizeable difference between 1-loop and 2-loop results , the relative smallness of the 2-loop expansion parameter , indicates that the 2-loop values are qualitatively trustworthy .",
    "it is well known that in order to find reliable perturbative results , one must go beyond 1-loop , and even beyond 2-loop approximations .",
    "therefore , one should not attach a firm quantitative meaning to the numerical values .",
    "let us compare our results with what was found elsewhere with different methods .",
    "a combined lattice fit resulted in @xmath133  @xmath129  @xmath134 , @xcite .",
    "we can not really compare this with our result for @xmath135 , since the lattice value was obtained with the ope at a scale @xmath136  @xmath83  @xmath137 in a specific renormalization scheme ( mom ) .",
    "however , it is satisfactory that ( [ res2b ] ) is at least of the same order of magnitude .",
    "more interesting is the comparison with what was found in @xcite with the local composite operator formalism for @xmath13 . in the @xmath86 scheme at 2-loop order , it was found that @xmath138 while @xmath139  @xmath129  @xmath140 which is in quite good agreement with our results .",
    "an estimate of the tree level gluon mass of @xmath141 was also given in @xcite which compares well with the lattice value of @xmath142 of @xcite .",
    "with the @xmath20 method , one does not really have the concept of a tree level mass .",
    "instead , the determination of @xmath65 would need the calculation of the highly non - trivial 2-loop @xmath20 mass renormalization graphs which is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "in conclusion we note that the perturbative yang - mills vacuum is unstable and lowers its value through a non - perturbative mass dimension two gluon condensate @xmath18 .",
    "we have omitted quark contributions in our analysis but it is straighforward to extend the @xmath20 expansion to qcd with quarks included .",
    "indeed an idea of the effect they have could be gained by an extension of @xcite .",
