    "it is one of the primary aims in cosmology to find the simplest model that best describes the astronomical observations . until now , the best concordance model with minimal number of parameters is currently known as the @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath1 ) model with the cosmological constant @xmath0 as dark energy and cdm as dominant dark matter @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been made to develop a cosmology model that is better than the conventional @xmath1 model .",
    "determining which model is preferred over the other is a problem of model selection . the standard approach used in the model selection",
    "is that one constrains the new model with data using the likelihood method and checks whether or not it is supported over the previous best model based on the statistical criteria . in usual cases ,",
    "the new candidate cosmology model has more free parameters than @xmath1 model while it often gives a better fitting of observational data .",
    "however , simply adding more parameters and getting smaller chi - square ( or larger likelihood ) does not make the relevant model rank as a better model . in order for a new cosmology model to be ranked as a model better than @xmath1 model",
    ", it should pass through at least one of the model selection criteria such as the likelihood ratio test @xcite , akaike information criterion @xcite , bayesian information criterion @xcite , bayesian evidence , and so on ( see also @xcite for applications in cosmology with brief reviews ) .",
    "although many dark energy models have been proposed , most of them give only a small improvement in fitting the observational data compared with the @xmath1 model and do not pass through the model selection criteria with high significance , implying that the @xmath1 model is the final winner in the competition of model selection @xcite .",
    "recently , park et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the observational effect of the early episodically dominating dark energy based on the minimally coupled scalar field with the albrecht - skordis potential , where the dark energy density transiently becomes strong during a short period of time .",
    "they show that the presence of the early epdisodic dark energy can affect the cosmological parameter estimation significantly and conclude that the recent planck data strongly favor the @xmath1 model because only a limited amount of dark energy with episodic nature is allowed . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a fluid version of early transiently dominating dark energy model with the similar episodic nature .",
    "our dark energy model is designed to have a transient spike in energy density during an extremely short period and the early scaling behavior with radiation and matter density .",
    "we show that our dark energy model gives a significant improved fit to the recent observational data with different parameter constraints and thus is preferred over the best - fit @xmath1 model based on some model selection criteria . through the example of dark energy spike model ,",
    "we show that the alternative parameter estimation with even better fitting of the same observational data is allowed in the einstein s gravity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : spike ] describes the fluid - based dark energy spike model with a transient variation in dark energy density and presents numerical calculations of background evolution of this model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , observational effects of the dark energy spike are investigated using the recent observational data such as the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) data from the planck satellite and the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data from the large - scale structure surveys .",
    "the cosmological parameters constrained with observations are compared in the presence of or without the dark energy spike . in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] , we compare our dark energy model with the conventional @xmath1 model based on some statistical criteria used in model selection .",
    "the discussion and conclusion are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] . throughout this paper , we set @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the quintessence - based early episodically dominating dark energy model proposed in @xcite is on a solid theoretical footing , but has its limitations .",
    "first , it is not easy to control the onset , strength , and duration of the transient dark energy because the behavior of dark energy strongly depends on potential parameters and initial conditions .",
    "second , the scalar - field based dark energy model theoretically does not accommodate the crossing of phantom divide ( @xmath6 ) in the dark energy equation of state , and thus it is not allowed to consider a _",
    "spike _ , a transient and abrupt variation of dark energy density , which inevitably induces @xmath6 crossing .",
    "here we introduce a fluid model of early dark energy that allows a dark energy spike and is easy to handle numerically .    in the conventional @xmath1 model , we add a new fluid ( denoted as @xmath7 ) with a transient spike in energy density .",
    "we assume that the dark energy density parameter ( @xmath8 ) is represented as the sum of a gaussian function and a constant in logarithmic scale - factor space , @xmath9 + b , \\label{eq : omega_x}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the energy density of the additional fluid , @xmath11 is the cosmic scale factor normalized to unity at present , @xmath12 is the hubble parameter at epoch @xmath13 with a dot as a time - derivative , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are interpreted as amplitude ( strength ) , temporal position , and duration of the dark energy spike , respectively .",
    "the constant term @xmath17 denotes the level of early dark energy that exists from the beginning of the universe and is responsible for the scaling evolution where the dark energy density follows that of the dominant fluid . in this paper",
    ", we incorporate the @xmath7-fluid and the cosmological constant @xmath0 into the effective fluid of dark energy ( de ) . the behavior of dark energy in our model shows early scaling evolution with radiation and matter densities with a sudden dark energy spike at a particular epoch and the late - time acceleration phase due to the cosmological constant . from here on ,",
    "we call the dark energy model with both scaling and transient behaviors as spike - de model , and the model only with the scaling behavior as scaling - de model .",
    "note that both the @xmath1 model ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and the scaling - de model ( @xmath18 and @xmath20 ) are nested within the spike - de model .    in the presence of the @xmath7-fluid ,",
    "the squared hubble parameter normalized with the present value is given by @xmath21 where the subindices @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 represent the radiation , matter , and spatial curvature , respectively , and the subindex zero indicates the present value .",
    "we assume that the @xmath7-fluid satisfies the continuity equation , @xmath25 .",
    "the pressure of the @xmath7-fluid is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 throughout this paper , we consider the spatially flat universe ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the equation of state of the effective dark energy fluid ( denoted with a subindex @xmath30 ) becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the dark energy density parameter ( @xmath35 ) has three asymptotic values : @xmath36 at the onset of the dark energy spike ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 before and after the onset ( @xmath39 ) and before the late - time acceleration ( @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 during the acceleration phase ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : bg_evol ] shows the evolution of density parameters , energy densities , dark energy equation of state , and hubble parameter in the spike - de model where a strong dark energy spike occurs at @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , together with those in scaling - de and @xmath1 models . as expected , the dark energy densities of spike - de ( green ) and scaling - de ( grey ) models show scaling behaviors following radiation and matter sequentially .",
    "the model parameters have been adopted as the best - fit ones obtained with the recent observational data ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] for details ) . in the spike - de model , the dark energy equation of state experiences a change of about three orders of magnitude with the crossing of phantom divide twice during the occurrence of dark energy spike",
    ". considering 95.4% ( @xmath45 ) confidence limits of the gaussian shape of the spike , it lasts for about 600 years ( @xmath46 ) .",
    ".best - fit cosmological parameters of the spatially flat @xmath1 , scaling - de , and spike - de models . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : chi - square ]    table [ tab : chi - square ] lists the separate chi - square ( @xmath47 ) values for each likelihood data set used in the parameter estimation for the best - fit @xmath1 , scaling - de , and spike - de models ( see table [ tab : best - fit ] for the best - fit values ) .",
    "the negative chi - square values for commander likelihood data appear due to the arbitrary normalization of log - likelihood in the cosmomc software .",
    "we note that the best - fit cosmological parameters in the presence of a dark energy spike near the radiation - matter equality gives a far smaller chi - square value than those of the @xmath1 model by about five times the number of new free parameters of the spike - de model ( @xmath14 , @xmath17 , @xmath48 , @xmath16 ) with a difference @xmath49 , which is a significant improvement of data - fitting .",
    "the three dark energy models considered here are nested in the sense that the @xmath1 and scaling - de models are special cases of the spike - de model . in this case",
    ", we can apply the likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) as a model selection method , where the null model is the @xmath1 model and the alternative model is the scaling - de or spike - de model @xcite .",
    "the test statistics is defined as the twice the natural logarithm of the ratio of likelihoods of the null and alternative hypotheses ( models ) and is equivalent to a difference of chi - square relative to the @xmath1 one , @xmath50 where @xmath51 indicates the maximum likelihood of the alternative model ( @xmath52 ) given the data ( @xmath53 ) , and likewise for the null model ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the lrt statistic is a computationally cheap version of the bayes factor which provides a criterion for penalizing models with more parameters based on the bayesian theory @xcite .",
    "the test statistic @xmath55 can be approximated as the @xmath47-distribution with degrees of freedom ( @xmath56 ) defined as the additional number of parameters of the nesting model ( @xmath57 for spike - de model , and @xmath58 for scaling - de model ) .",
    "the @xmath59-value , the probability that the null hypothesis is supported by the observational data over the alternative one , is calculated from the cumulative @xmath47-distribution and presented in table [ tab : chi - square ] .",
    "we find that the @xmath59-value for the spike - de model as alternative is quite small ( @xmath60 ) , suggesting a strong preference to the spike - de model against the @xmath1 model .",
    "the akaike information criterion ( aic ) is defined as @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of free parameters of the model considered .",
    "if the alternative model gives a smaller aic compared with the null ( @xmath1 ) model , it is ranked as a better model because the discrepancy with the true model is considered to be smaller .",
    "it is generally accepted that the aic difference of 5 or more gives a strong evidence supporting the model with smaller aic value ( see @xcite for the reliability of the aic method in cosmological model selection ) .",
    "the differences of aic relative to the @xmath1 model ( @xmath63 ) are listed in table [ tab : chi - square ] .",
    "the scaling - de model has a positive value of @xmath64 , which means that introducing the scaling dark energy without a spike into the @xmath1 model does not improve the fit much .",
    "on the other hand , the negative value of @xmath65 for the spike - de model suggests that the alternative model of dark energy with early scaling behavior and a dark energy spike ( near the radiation - matter equality ) is strongly favored by the current cosmological observations over the @xmath1 model .    as an alternative to the aic , the bayesian information criterion ( bic )",
    "is often used for model selection , which assigns a conservative penalty for large sample size .",
    "the bic is defined as @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of data points .",
    "we set @xmath68 for planck+bao data sets ( @xmath69 for lowlike [ tt , te , ee , bb ] , commander , camspec , lensing , and bao data , respectively ) to calculate the difference of bic relative to the @xmath1 value ( @xmath70 ) , which are listed in table [ tab : chi - square ] .",
    "contrary to the aic result , the spike - de model has a positive value of @xmath71 .",
    "the strong evidence supporting the presence of dark energy spike by the aic has disappeared , since the bic penalizes complex models by the large number of data points as in the cmb observation . in the context of bic , the scaling - de model with @xmath58",
    "is preferred over the spike - de model ( @xmath57 ) .    in summary , comparison of the maximum likelihoods of spike - de and @xmath1 models according to lrt and",
    "aic suggests that the spike - de model is strongly preferred over the @xmath1 one while the bic still indicates the observational data supports the simple @xmath1 model over others . from the definition of aic and bic",
    "we see that the aic is inclined to select the model that better fits to the data while the bic selects a simpler model with less parameters .",
    "apart from the model selection between @xmath1 and spike - de models , at least we conclude that the spike - de model fits the observational data far better than @xmath1 model with the different cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "according to table [ tab : chi - square ] , the spike - de model improves fitting to the camspec high @xmath72 temperature likelihood data .",
    "figure [ fig : powspec ] verifies that the chi - square decrease is mainly due to the better fitting of planck temperature power spectrum data around the third ( @xmath73 ) and sixth ( @xmath3 ) acoustic peaks where strong residuals relative to the best - fit @xmath1 model are seen . in the middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : powspec ] , we plot the difference of the observed and the model - predicted band power spectra ( @xmath74 ) normalized with the measurement error ( @xmath75 ) for each @xmath72-bin ( here denoted as @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 , and the sum of contribution due to @xmath78 within the bin , @xmath79 , which approximates the chi - square contribution for each bin .",
    "the model band power @xmath80 is the average of the cmb angular power spectrum @xmath81 predicted by a model within a specified bin .",
    "we use the same @xmath72-bins used in the planck team s analysis .",
    "it was originally reported that the strong residuals seen around the third ( @xmath2 ) and fifth ( @xmath82@xmath83 ) acoustic peaks are real features of the primordial cmb sky @xcite .",
    "we note that the best - fit spike - de model significantly alleviates the strong residuals around the third ( @xmath2 ) and sixth ( @xmath3 ) acoustic peaks observed in the best - fit @xmath1 model ( red and black dots ) .",
    "however , the residual around the fifth peak ( @xmath82@xmath83 ) still remains in both models .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the observational effect of the early episodically dominating dark energy which accommodates a dark energy spike , a sudden transient variation in dark energy density , together with early scaling behaviors and late - time acceleration .",
    "the dark energy model with a spike ( spike - de model ) near the radiation - matter equality era improves the fit to the planck cmb temperature power spectrum data around the third ( @xmath2 ) and sixth ( @xmath3 ) acoustic peaks . comparing the likelihood distributions based on the maximum likelihood ratio test and the akaike information criterion as the statistical model selection methods , we find that the spike - de model is strongly favored by observations over the conventional @xmath1 model .",
    "furthermore , the spike - de model provides the different cosmological parameter estimation with tighter constraints on matter density and hubble constant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : like ] and table [ tab : cl ] ) .",
    "however , the strong evidence supporting the presence of the dark energy spike disappears based on the the bayesian information criterion which assigns a conservative penalty to the model with a large number of parameters .    we have checked that including high-@xmath72 cmb data observed by the south pole telescope and the atacama cosmology telescope @xcite or excluding the tensor - type perturbation do not affect our main results . besides , we infer that the foreground and instrumental calibration parameters do not play a major role in improving the fit to the data . if they do , a significant reduction of chi - square should be seen in the case of @xmath1 model , too .    very recently , the planck 2015 data have been publicly available . the main scientific conclusions of planck 2015 data analysis are consistent with the previous results , with cosmological parameters deviating less than @xmath84 @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powspec ] , the strong residuals around @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the planck 2013 temperature power spectrum data are not observed in the planck 2015 data ; the deviation from the best - fit @xmath1 model prediction becomes quite smaller ( see green open circles in the middle and bottom panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : powspec ] ) .",
    "therefore , the success of the spike - de model in improving the fit to the planck 2013 temperature power spectrum at those regions is not expected any more in the recent planck 2015 data",
    ". however , the presence of strong residuals at @xmath85@xmath86 and @xmath87 in the planck 2015 data still leaves open the possibility that the new data are fitted by another candidate model of dark energy far better than @xmath1 model .    through an example of the dark energy spike model",
    ", we emphasize that the alternative cosmological parameter estimation is allowed in the einstein s gravity , with even better fitting of the same observational data than the conventional @xmath1 model .",
