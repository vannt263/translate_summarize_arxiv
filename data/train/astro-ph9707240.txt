    "cosmological models seeded by topological defects such as cosmic strings ( zeldovich 1980 ; vilenkin 1981,1985 ) , global textures ( turok 1989 ) and global monopoles ( barriola & vilenkin 1989 ; bennett & rhie 1990 ) have been proposed as an alternative to inflationary models , under the general gravitational instability paradigm of structure formation .",
    "inflationary models such as the cold dark matter ( cdm ) models are gaussian in the sense that the one - point density probability function is gaussian distributed , generated by random quantum fluctuations in the early universe ( guth & pi 1982 ; albrecht & steinhardt 1982 ; hawking 1982 ; linde 1982 ; starobinsky 1982 ; bardeen , steinhardt & turner 1983 ) .",
    "in contrast , topological defect based models , taking the texture model as an example throughout this paper , are non - gaussian and highly skewed .",
    "more importantly , it is thought that , in the gaussian models , cosmic entities such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies form around high peaks in the initial density field , identifiable after smoothing the density field by a window of the size of the objects of interest .",
    "this structure formation scheme in gaussian models , initially put forth by kaiser ( 1984 ) to explain the enhanced abell cluster correlation and named the  biased \" structure formation mechanism , yields a clustering of clusters of galaxies substantially stronger than matter or galaxies ( e.g. , peacock & heavens 1985 ; barnes 1985 ; bardeen 1986 ; martinez - gonzalez & sanz 1988 ; frenk 1990 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the texture model ( turok 1989 ) predicts that textures , being the sites where galaxies or clusters of galaxies later form , are uncorrelated and randomly distributed _ initially _ on scales larger than their horizon size ( spergel 1991 ) , which in the case of clusters is about @xmath6mpc . in this paper",
    "we relate this initial property of textures to the final spatial correlational properties of clusters of galaxies ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ; klypin & kopylov 1983 ) .",
    "we identify clusters of galaxies as a good tool because they are likely to be less affected than galaxies by non - gravitational processes .",
    "consequently , calculations of their clustering properties under the gravitational instability scenario are likely to be valid .",
    "in addition , the scales where the cluster - cluster correlation function is reliably measured observationally have not yet left the linear regime and therefore some simple linear theory relations may be employed .",
    "we show that the two - point cluster - cluster correlation length in the texture model is in the range @xmath7mpc for an unbiased @xmath8 model , and proportional approximately inversely to @xmath9 . in comparison ,",
    "the observed correlation length is @xmath10mpc ( at an approximately @xmath4 level ) .",
    "since observations of rich cluster abundance independently require that @xmath11 for @xmath0 ( the cosmological mean density in units of the critical density ) inflationary models ( bahcall & cen 1992 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , @xmath12 is necessary for the corresponding non - gaussian ( positively skewed ) models in order not to overproduce the abundance of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "we therefore conclude that the texture model , or any random ( or weakly correlated ) seed cosmological models _ per se _ , is ruled out at a very high confidence level ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "for a related , very comprehensive study of non - gaussian as well gaussian models using a suite of well defined statistical measures , see weinberg & cole ( 1992 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give an analytic technique to compute the evolution of the correlation function for any set of objects and apply it to the specific case of clusters of galaxies in the texture model .",
    "conclusions are given in  3 .",
    "the approach adopted here to calculate the cluster - cluster two - point correlation function in the texture model is conceptually very simple , as follows . barring merging ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the two - point correlation function of any set of objects , @xmath13 , is governed by the pair conservation equation ( equation 71.6 of peebles 1980 ) : @xmath14=0 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is time ; @xmath16 is the expansion parameter ; @xmath17 is the comoving separation ; and @xmath18 is the mean pairwise proper peculiar velocity .",
    "our subsequent results are directly or indirectly based on this equation .",
    "note that equation ( 1 ) is valid for _ any set of objects_. we will first derive a relation between pairwise peculiar velocity and correlation function of the matter in the linear regime , using equation ( 1 ) . following subramanian & padmanahban ( 1994 ) , substituting the conventional two - point matter correlation function @xmath19 with @xmath20 , the volume - averaged two - point correlation of the _ underlying matter _ within a sphere of radius @xmath17 , defined by @xmath21 we may obtain a slightly different form for equation ( 1 ) as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath18 is negative when pairs approach .",
    "equation ( 3 ) is obtained by substituting equation ( 2 ) into equation ( 1 ) and by integrating it once with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "an integration constant on the right hand side of equation ( 3 ) has been set to zero in order to produce the right asymptotic behavior : @xmath19 freezes out in comoving space when @xmath24 . in the linear limit , where the peculiar velocity is much smaller than the hubble velocity ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( for an @xmath0 universe , which is assumed throughout and consistent with the texture model where @xmath0 is usually assumed ; we note that this linear growth rate of matter correlation is in agreement with detailed numerical simulations of cen 1991 and park , spergel , & turok 1991 ) , the only nontrivial solution is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hubble velocity for separation @xmath17 at time @xmath15",
    ".    equation ( 4 ) allows us to obtain the evolution of the total matter pairwise motion , @xmath29 , from @xmath20 , which in turn is constrained by the observed galaxy - galaxy two - point correlation function . for the linear scales which we are interested in , namely @xmath10mpc , where density fluctuations at all epochs are in the linear regime",
    ", we assume the following form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the galaxy - galaxy correlation length at @xmath32 ; @xmath33 is the ( linear ) bias factor ; and we have changed the time variable from @xmath15 to redshift @xmath34 . combining equations ( 2,4,5 )",
    "we obtain the _ mean comoving _ pairwise velocity of total matter ( similar to equation 71.13 of peebles 1980 ) , @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the present hubble constant and we have made use of the relation @xmath38 for the @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "equation ( 6 ) describes the evolution of the _ mean comoving _ pairwise velocity of _ total matter _ in the _ linear regime _ , constrained by the observed galaxy - galaxy correlation function and linear theory .",
    "we now make a critical observation that a subset of objects , for example , cluster - scale textures , can have _ different _ @xmath39 from that of total matter",
    ". it would not be hard to imagine cases where such situations could arise .",
    "for instance , in defect models where density fluctuations are produced by initial density and/or velocity kicks , both decaying and growing modes exist , whereas equation ( 6 ) describes only the growing mode of the overall matter perturbation under the self - gravitational action of the matter itself .",
    "while detailed dynamics of textures and the induced matter perturbations are very complicated and require nonlinear numerical calculations , we argue that there is a maximal @xmath39 for any random set of objects within the gravitational instability framework .",
    "two examples should demonstrate the relevant possible cases .",
    "in the first example , if the perturbation seeds are densely populated in redshift , one may obtain the time - averaged peculiar velocity at any epoch as @xmath40 where the second equality is obtained by inserting @xmath41 and @xmath39 is given by equation ( 6 ) . in the second example , if the perturbation seeds are sparsely created in redshift , one then has the time - averaged peculiar velocity at any epoch as @xmath42 the denominator in equation ( 8) becomes apparent by noting that @xmath43 ( @xmath18 is the proper pairwise velocity ) , indicated by equations ( 4,5 ) . in both cases ( equations 7,8 ) , we have maximized the velocity by assuming that the initial velocity ( kick ) is just let decay as @xmath44 due to the universal expansion .",
    "one may think of @xmath45 or @xmath46 as the envelope wrapping a set of decaying velocity modes in redshift , which are seamed onto the general matter velocity evolution ( growing mode ) when the decaying velocity is just about to fall below the growing velocity .",
    "such decaying modes can be created , for example , by velocity kicks due to the unwinding of ever larger ( when time progresses ) textures in the expanding universe , up to the present ( spergel 1991 ) .",
    "a critical assumption has just been made here and is worth being elaborated more .",
    "that is , the velocity of these considered objects , while allowed to be different from that of the matter for periods of time , is demanded to be synchronized with that of overall matter at some intermittent points .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that , while perturbation seeds ( whose occurrences may not be limited to certain time intervals ) create the initial perturbations , the subsequent evolution of perturbed matter density / velocity fields is determined by the gravitational instability of the matter itself ( i.e. , self - gravity of the matter ) . however",
    ", if perturbation seeds not only initiate the perturbations but also dominate the subsequent evolution , our assumption breaks down .",
    "but such extreme cases would not fit into the gravitational instability picture which we are considering here ; i.e. , such cases are likely to have some other grossly different properties than those encountered in the gravitational instability framework . in any case , it seems that all proposed seed models , including those based on topological defects or other , ( perhaps ) more conventional seeds such as primordial black holes ( e.g. , villumsen , scherrer , & bertschinger 1991 ) , do not have such dominant perturbation seeds , at least on the scales which we are investigating here ( @xmath47mpc ) .",
    "we therefore argue that the pairwise velocity given in equation ( 8) constitutes the upper limit of possible values for any set of selected objects within the general gravitational instability framework . in the specific case of the texture model , the textures are relatively rare , as indicated by the texture evolution results ( spergel 1991 ) , @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 being the number density of textures created per unit comoving volume ( @xmath51 is the conformal time ) .",
    "this implies that the correlation function of clusters in the texture model should be more appropriately upper limited by that derived using the velocity field given by equation ( 8) , as will be shown below .",
    "we note that , while equation ( 1 ) is valid for any set of objects , equation ( 4 ) may not hold for them even at large scales where @xmath18 is small compared to the hubble velocity ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "the reason is that equation ( 4 ) was derived in the limit where both @xmath52 and @xmath25 .",
    "but the correlation of clusters of galaxies under consideration here is supposedly significantly higher than that of matter thus may not be much less unity . as a result , we can not directly convert @xmath18 into @xmath13 using equation ( 4 ) for the objects under our consideration , rather we need to solve equation ( 1 ) directly by providing @xmath29 . although it is straightforward to solve equation ( 1 ) to get @xmath13 given @xmath18 , we find the following method ( basically a lagrangian integral form of equation 1 ) conceptually simple to work with to derive the evolution of @xmath13 .",
    "let us write down the usual form ( definition ) of @xmath13 at any epoch : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of pairs within a shell of width @xmath55 located @xmath17 from an object in question ; @xmath50 is the number density of the objects of interest . in the absence of shell crossing of pairs , which holds for the form of @xmath39 as given in equation ( 6 )",
    ", we can relate the final correlation to the initial correlaton by @xmath56 -1   \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the initial and final separations ( bins ) of pairs under consideration , respectively .",
    "therefore , all that we need to do is to solve the evolution of @xmath17 , which is very simple to follow .",
    "what is yet left to be specified is the initial correlation function of textures , @xmath59 .",
    "spergel ( 1991 ) have shown that textures are initially uncorrelated ( randomly distributed ) on scales larger than their horizon size .",
    "for textures which we are interested in here , their horizon size is about @xmath6mpc , giving a mass of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , there is no clustering of cluster - size textures on scales @xmath10mpc _ initially _ , the range over which we wish to compute the evolution of clustering of these textures ; i.e. , @xmath61 at @xmath62mpc . a related point , the majority of these textures are produced at times slightly before the epoch of matter radiation equality at redshift @xmath63 in the texture model ( gooding , spergel , & turok 1991 ) .    integrating @xmath64 , where @xmath39 is given by equation ( 7 ) or ( 8) , with the initial condition @xmath61 at @xmath65 ( the starting redshift of pairwise movement , presumably the birth redshift of the relevant textures at @xmath66 )",
    "give the correlation function of the clusters at redshift @xmath34 : @xmath67 where @xmath68.\\ ] ] setting @xmath13 to be unity ( and @xmath69 ) we can find the cluster - cluster correlation length at @xmath32 @xmath70^{1/\\gamma } b^{-2/\\gamma } \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath71 is @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , for the two cases indicated by equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) . the results shown in figure 1 , the corrlation length of clusters as a function of bias parameter @xmath9 , are computed using equation ( 13 ) with the canonical observed values for galaxies ( davis & geller 1976 ) of @xmath74 and @xmath75mpc .",
    "three cases are shown for three values of @xmath71 : @xmath76 corresponds to matter correlation ( heavy solid curve ) , @xmath72 corresponds to the upper limit in the case of densely populated seeds in redshift space ( heavy long dashed curve ) , and @xmath73 corresponds to the upper limit in the case of sparsely populated seeds in redshift space ( heavy short dashed curve ) , which we argue is the absolute upper limit .",
    "also shown in figure 1 are the corresponding cases with @xmath77 to illustrate the dependence of the correlation length on @xmath78 , the slope of the correlation function .",
    "we note that , in the derivation of @xmath79 , no assumption about the cluster number density is made , except the very weak dependence of the calculation on @xmath65 due to different birth redshift of seeds for different mass clusters .",
    "this implies that the cluster correlation length in the texture model , or any other seed model of that sort , is richness independent .",
    "we see that the cluster - cluster two - point correlation length should be in the range @xmath80mpc ( between heavy solid and short dashed curves ) for an unbiased @xmath8 model , and decreases with increasing bias parameter .",
    "this correlation length range for the @xmath8 model is consistent with the results obtained from n - body simulations by park , spergel , & turok ( 1991 ) , who find a correlation length of @xmath81mpc ( adapted from figure 3 of park 1991 ) for the @xmath8 model .",
    "this agreement lends support for the validity of this analytic approach , and perhaps explains the origin of cluster - cluster correlation in the texture model . another way to explain the origin is this .",
    "the correlation of clusters of galaxies , whose seeds are produced without any mutual correlation initially at high redshift near matter radiation equality in the textures model , grows gradually with time due to density perturbations on larger scales induced by larger textures which unwind at subsequent times up to the present .",
    "observations of galaxy cluster abundance indicate that the bias parameter @xmath82 for @xmath0 inflationary gaussian models ( bahcall & cen 1992 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the required bias parameter in non - gaussian ( positively skewed ) models is even larger due precisely to the non - gaussianity , which enables collapse of overdense regions easier .",
    "we hence see that , for a viable defect model with @xmath12 and @xmath0 , the cluster - cluster correlation function length should be smaller than @xmath83mpc ( obtained for @xmath1 models ) .",
    "the depedence on @xmath78 is weak at @xmath84 as seen in figure 1 : for the extreme case with @xmath77 , @xmath85mpc for @xmath1 models .",
    "the range in @xmath79 is due to the possible range in @xmath71 .",
    "postman , huchra , & geller ( 1992 ) give @xmath86mpc using a complete sample of 361 abell clusters .",
    "nichol ( 1992 ) present @xmath87mpc for a 90 percent complete sample of 97 clusters from the edinburgh - durham southern galaxy catalogue .",
    "dalton ( 1992 ) yield @xmath88mpc for 173 clusters from apm galaxy survey and @xmath89mpc for the 93 richest clusters in the sample .",
    "dalton ( 1994 ) conclude that @xmath90mpc ( @xmath4 ) for 364 clusters from an extended apm galaxy survey .",
    "romer ( 1994 ) indicate @xmath91mpc for a rosat x - ray selected cluster sample of 128 clusters .",
    "croft ( 1997 ) find @xmath92mpc ( @xmath4 ) for clusters with a mean space density of @xmath93mpc@xmath94 , equivalent to the space density of abell richness @xmath95 clusters , by analysing a new catalogue of very rich clusters selected from apm galaxy survey . while uncertainties remain in the current clustering analyses of observed clusters due to",
    "still limited cluster samples of order of a few hundred clusters at most , it seems that all these studies have consistently given a correlation length @xmath10mpc at approximately @xmath4 level with average errorbar of size of @xmath96mpc .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath84 texture models can be ruled out at a very high confidence level ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "based on simple analytic reasoning within the gravitational instability framework , we are able to set an upper limit on the correlation length of clusters of galaxies in any _ random _ seed cosmological model , regardless of the nature of the seeds , which could be topological defects such as textures or more conventional seeds such as primordial black holes .",
    "it is shown that clusters of galaxies in any biased @xmath1 model has a two - point correlation length of @xmath97mpc ( for a slope of the correlation function of @xmath98 ) .",
    "more likely , one is forced to adopt a bias parameter @xmath99 for such non - gaussian ( positively skewed ) models as not to overproduce the abundance of rich clusters of galaxies observed locally , since it is easier to form overdense structures with non - gaussian positively skewed density perturbations .",
    "all recent observations indicate a correlation length @xmath100mpc at an approximately @xmath4 level for real rich clusters of galaxies ( with a typical errorbar size of @xmath96mpc ) .",
    "it is thus apparent that any topological defect models or any random seed models are ruled out at a very high confidence level ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "while this constraint is completely independent of observations on any other scales including those of the cmb , the requirement of a large @xmath101 in order to fit the observed angular power of cmb on very large scales for the global texture model ( pen 1997 ) , for example , would render the model inviable in terms of matching the observed correlation of rich galaxy clusters",
    ".    an unbiased @xmath8 topological defect model might be able to provide a reasonable match to the observed cluster correlation .",
    "one way to achieve this is to adopt a lower density model with @xmath102 ( with or without a cosmological constant @xmath103 ) .",
    "but such a model might have more difficulty in fitting the large scale cmb observations .",
    "in addition , such a model ( especially in the case with zero @xmath103 ) might run into the opposite of a problem that inflationary cold dark matter models have : too early structure formation .",
    "this deserves more careful calculations , should such a model be put forth .",
    "another exit is to have the perturbations seeds responsible for the formation of clusters of galaxies at later times significantly clustered at birth before any gravitational evolution , somewhat analagous to high density peaks in gaussian models .",
    "this might be an attractive route to search for potentially viable seed models , especially those based on topological defects .",
    "i would like to thank michael strauss for a careful reading of the paper and the referee for a nice report .",
