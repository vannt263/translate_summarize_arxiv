    "entanglement is one of the most amazing phenomena of the quantum mechanics .",
    "it is probably the most studied topic recently due to the fact that it is somehow related to a wide range of research areas from quantum information processing to thermodynamics of the black holes .",
    "it were einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) and schrdinger who first recognized a  spooky \" feature of quantum mechanics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this feature implies the existence of global states of composite systems which can not be written as a product of the states of the individual subsystems @xcite .",
    "this feature shows that quantum mechanics has a non local character . in this respect",
    ", this property seems to contradict the postulates of special relativity .",
    "the main aim of epr was actually to discuss the  completeness \" of quantum mechanics .",
    "the underlying assumption of the paper was the locality condition ; with this assumption the quantum mechanics seemed to be an incomplete theory .",
    "however , j. s. bell showed that this non local property lies at the heart of the quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "due to the contradiction one faces with the postulates of special relativity in discussing the issue of locality , to settle those issues one needs to address the same problem in different inertial frames which move with relativistic speeds .",
    "one of the first articles that discusses the entanglement in different inertial frames was that of p. m. alsing and g. j. milburn @xcite . after this paper",
    ", there were numerous studies discussing the lorentz covariance of the entanglement and bell type inequalities @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this thesis , we study the properties of entangled states and bell inequalities under lorentz transformations . for this purpose",
    "we first introduced the theoretical background for the relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "this part briefly summarizes the quantum mechanics and mainly concentrates on the poincar group and its unitary irreducible representations .",
    "constructing the representation of the poincar group in the hilbert space of the one particle states reduces to that of the little group .",
    "it is shown that wigner rotation plays a crucial role for the entangled states .",
    "moreover in this part , we have discussed the physical requirements of the spin operator in detail due to the fact that there are some ambiguities on what the correct relativistic spin operator is .",
    "then , in the third chapter , we have devoted special attention on the two historical papers @xcite and @xcite for defining entanglement , and then we have given more formal definitions of entanglement and written the bell type inequalities in a more elegant way .",
    "the next chapter forms the main part of the thesis in which we have investigated the lorentz transformation of entangled states and discussed the @xmath0 inequality for the transformed states .",
    "finally , the last chapter is devoted to conclusions .",
    "any physical theory which claims to describe the nature fully at all scales and speeds must obey the rules of both quantum mechanics and the special theory of relativity .",
    "this fundamental unification can be attained via fields or point particles .",
    "although the main stream starts from the field concept , both ways end up with probably the most  beautiful \" theory of physics , that is quantum field theory . due to the our specific problem",
    ", we have preferred the second way by following weinberg s well known book @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have to start with quantum mechanics and poincar algebra which includes all the aspects of the special relativity .",
    "quantum mechanics can be briefly summarized as follows in the generalized version of dirac ;    * physical states are represented by rays in a kind of complex vector space , called hilbert space such that if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are state vectors , then so is @xmath3 for arbitrary complex numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "if we define @xmath6 and @xmath7 , then one can introduce the inner product complex number in this space such that @xmath8 a ray is a set of normalized vectors @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an arbitrary complex number with @xmath12 . as a result , @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 represent the same physical state .",
    "* observables are represented by hermitian operators which are mappings @xmath15 of hilbert space into itself , linear in the sense that @xmath16 and satisfying the reality condition @xmath17 if the state vectors @xmath18 are eigenvectors of an operator @xmath19 , then state has a definite value for this observable @xmath20 for the hermitian operator @xmath19 , @xmath21 are real and @xmath22 .",
    "* measurements are described by a collection of measurement operators @xmath23 where @xmath24 refers to outcomes measurement that may occur in the experiment and satisfying the completeness relation such that @xmath25 just before the measurement , if the state is @xmath18 , then probability of getting the result @xmath24 just after the measurement is @xmath26 where @xmath27 must hold , and initial state collapses to @xmath28 special case of the measurements defined here is the projective measurement .",
    "any observable can be written in the spectral decomposition form @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the eigenvalues and @xmath31 is the eigenstate of the observable @xmath19 such that @xmath32 .",
    "+ for the projective measurement , the result of the measurement is one of the eigenvalues of the observable @xmath19 with the probability @xmath33 and the collapsed state after the measurement is the corresponding eigenvector . *",
    "total hilbert space of multi partite system consisting of @xmath34 subsystems is a tensor product of the subsystem spaces = _ l=1^n _ l .",
    "in addition to these postulates , it must be defined that if a physical system is represented by state vector @xmath35 and @xmath36 in different but equivalent frames , then transformation between these two frames must be performed by either a unitary and linear or anti - unitary and anti - linear transformations due to the conservation of probability , which is proven by wigner @xcite :      according to einstein s principle of relativity if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two sets of coordinates in inertial frames @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then they are related as @xmath41 . the physical requirement relating",
    "these two sets are the invariance of the infinitesimal intervals : @xmath42 where the metric @xmath43 is of signature @xmath44 .",
    "this invariance of the interval imposes the following constraints on the transformation coordinates [ metrictrans ] _",
    ". this transformation is called poincar transformation or inhomogeneous lorentz transformation . when @xmath45 @xmath46 , then this transformation reduces to homogeneous lorentz transformation .",
    "it can be easily shown that these transformations form a group , as briefly summarized below :    * closure : + let @xmath47 and @xmath48 , then x  & = & _ 2 ( _ 1 x + a_1 ) + a_2 + & = & _ 2 _ 1 x + _ 2 a_1 + a_2 = _ 3 x + a_3 . + as a result @xmath49 . *",
    "identity : i = ( i , 0 ) * inverse : ( _ 2,a_2)(_1,a_1 ) & = & ( _ 2 _ 1 , _ 2 a_1 + a_2 ) = ( i , 0 ) + & & _ 2 = _ 1 ^ -1 a_2",
    "= - _ 2 a_1 = - _ 1 ^ -1 a_1 as a result inverse of @xmath50 is @xmath51 .",
    "* associativity : ( _ 2 , a_2)[(_1,a_1)(,a ) ] = [ ( _ 2 , a_2)(_1,a_1 ) ] ( , a )    furthermore , this group can be restricted further by the choice of sign of both the determinant and the  00 \" component of @xmath52 as follows : take the determinant of both sides of ( [ metrictrans ] ) , and get ( det ) ^2 = 1 , which leads to @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "next , considering the  00 \" component of ( [ metrictrans ] ) , ( ^0_0)^2 - ( ^0_i)^2 = 1 which means that @xmath55 . the possible solutions are @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "the lorentz group that satisfies the @xmath53 and @xmath58 is called _ proper orthochronous lorentz group _ and any lorentz transformation that can be obtained from identity must belong to this group .",
    "thus the study of the entire lorentz group reduces to the study of its proper orthochronous subgroup .",
    "hereafter , we will deal only with inhomogeneous or homogenous proper orthochronous lorentz group .",
    "the infinitesimal transformation for the inhomogeneous lorentz group now can be written as _",
    "= ^_+ ^ _ , a^= ^then , one gets from ( [ metrictrans ] ) _ = _ + _ + _ + o(^2 ) which implies that @xmath59 ; note that @xmath60 .",
    "this transformation can be represented by @xmath61 u ( , a ) x^u^-1 ( , a ) = ^_x^+ a^. for an infinitesimal transformation @xmath61 can be parameterized as [ infinitetarnsfor ] u(1 + , ) = 1 + _ m^ - i _",
    "p^+ here , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the generators of the homogeneous lorentz transformations and translations , respectively . since @xmath64 is antisymmetric , @xmath62 can be taken antisymmetric also .",
    "one can easily show that @xmath61 also forms a group .",
    "then , it follows u(,a ) u(1 + , ) u^-1(,a ) & = & u ( ( 1 + ) ^-1 , - ^-1a ) + u(,a ) ( 1 + _ m^ - i _ p^ ) u^-1(,a ) & = & 1 + ( ^-1 ) _ m^ - i ( - ^-1a ) _ p^. we can now read off the transformation rules of the generators of the poincar group , from this equation : @xmath65    for the infinitesimal transformations as @xmath66 , and using ( [ infinitetarnsfor ] ) we get @xmath67 & = & \\eta^{\\nu \\rho}m^{\\mu \\sigma } - \\eta^{\\mu \\rho}m^{\\nu \\sigma } - \\eta^{\\sigma \\mu}m^{\\rho \\nu } + \\eta^{\\sigma \\nu } m^{\\rho \\mu } , \\\\",

    "however the boost generators do not form a group and this is the reason of the famous thomas precession .",
    "poincar group is a connected lie group , which means that each element of the group is connected to the identity by a path within the group , but is not compact since the velocity can not take the @xmath76 value after boost transformations .    a well known theorem states that any non - compact lie group has no finite dimensional unitary representation .",
    "it has unitary representations in the infinite dimensional space .    as a result representations of the poincar group on the state vectors in the infinite dimensional hilbert space",

    "furthermore , if one finds all the independent casimir operators for an algebra , then the representation of this algebra in the space of eigenvectors of these casimir operators will be irreducible . in other words ,",
    "classification of the irreducible representations of a lie group reduces to finding of a complete set of casimir operators and calculating the eigenvalues of these operators .    in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that poincar group has two independent casimir operators which are c_1 & = & p^2 = p^p _ , + c_2 & = & w^2 = w^w_where @xmath79 is the pauli - lubanski vector .",

    "can be given as ,    * first of all , the square of the three - spin operator must be lorentz invariant , i.e , one can not change the spin - statistics by applying poincar transformation . * due to the similar structure to the total angular momentum , @xmath88 must be a pseudovector just like @xmath89 . in other words",

    "bell .",
    "let s briefly review this one of the most cited articles of human history .",
    "this article starts with the discussion and definition of  complete theory \" and  condition of reality \" .",
    "they define a complete theory as any physical theory must include all the elements of physical reality , on the other hand the condition of reality is described as predicting physical quantity in a certain way without disturbing the system . however in quantum mechanics , incompatible observables can not be simultaneously measured . as a result ,",
    "either the quantum mechanical description of physical realty is not complete , or the values of the incompatible observables can not be simultaneously real . if the quantum mechanics is a complete theory then second argument is correct .",
    "consider two particles with a space - like separation .",
    "in quantum mechanics , one can define the wave function of the composite system as ( x_1 , x_2 ) = _ n=1^_n(x_2 ) u_n(x_1 ) where @xmath161 is the wave function of the first particle which is the eigenfunction of some operator @xmath19 with the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath21 , and @xmath162 is wave function of the second one . according to the measurement postulate of quantum mechanics , if the observable @xmath19 is measured on the first particle with the value @xmath163 , then after the measurement the wave function of the first particle collapses to the @xmath164 , and second one collapses to the @xmath165 .",
    "alternatively , this physical function can be expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions of some different operator @xmath141 , such that ( x_1 , x_2 ) = _ s=1^_s(x_2 ) v_s(x_1 ) .",
    "then if the result of the measurement of @xmath141 is @xmath166 and corresponding collapsed function is @xmath167 for the first particle , then second particle automatically collapses to the @xmath168 .",
    "furthermore , this process can be performed with the incompatible observables @xmath19 and @xmath141 .",
    "the strange thing is that one can predict the physical values of @xmath19 and @xmath141 with certainty without disturbing the second particle , via a single measurement on the joint system .    here",
    ", we have started our discussion by accepting quantum mechanics as a complete theory , however we have ended up with the result that contradicts it .",
    "then one can conclude naturally that quantum mechanical description of physical reality can not be considered complete .",
    "one resolution of the problem was based on the hidden variables .",
    "actually one of the most important aspect of that paper was the introduction of the entangled states .",
    "it was shown that this paradox occurs only in entangled states , and this phenomenon is known as  entanglement \" .",
    "it was originally called by schrdinger as  verschrankung \" @xcite .",
    "as one can see , the main assumption that lies in the background of epr s argument is the locality condition .      in his analysis of the epr problem , j.s .",
    "bell uses the version of d. bohm and y. aharonov @xcite .",
    "this entangled state is a well known singlet state which is |singlet = ( | ; | ; - | ; | ; ) where @xmath169 is the spin polarization direction .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the correlation function for the singlet state is given by [ qmbell ] c ( , ) = singlet| _ 1 _ 2 |singlet = - .",
    "to prove this , let us first note that _ 1 |singlet = - _ 2 |singlet then _",

    "1_j + & = & - a_i b_j _",
    "ij + i _ ijk _",
    "1_k = - where we used the fact that the expectation value of @xmath170 is zero in the singlet state .",
    "let s introduce a hidden variable @xmath171 which can be anything such that the complicated measurement processes are determined by this parameter and also measurement direction .",
    "let the result of the measurement of @xmath172 on the first particle and @xmath173 on the second particle be a ( , ) = 1 b ( , ) = 1 respectively .",
    "the crucial point is that result on the first particle does not depend on @xmath174 and vice versa . then the correlation for the singlet state",
    "is given by [ bellcorrel ] c ( , ) = d ( ) a ( , ) b ( , ) where @xmath175 is the probability distribution that depends on @xmath171 .",
    "this result has to match with the quantum mechanical result .",
    "but it is shown that this is impossible .    before showing the contradiction , first it is easy to show how hidden variable theory can work on a single particle state and on a singlet state .",
    "for the single particle state , let the hidden variable be a unit vector with uniform probability distribution over the hemisphere @xmath176 , then the result of the measurement can be defined as sign  where unit vector @xmath177 depends on @xmath178 and @xmath169 .",
    "( this result does not say anything about when @xmath179 , however the probability of getting it is zero , @xmath180 . )",
    "+    the expectation value for a single particle state in the spin polarization direction @xmath169 , is then = 1 p (  > 0 ) - 1 p (  < 0 ) = 1 - where @xmath181 is the angle between @xmath177 and @xmath182 as shown in the figure ( [ bellsingle ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath181 can be adjusted such that 1 - = where @xmath183 is the angle between @xmath178 and @xmath169 .",
    "thus we have reached the desired result as in the quantum mechanics .    for the singlet state",
    ", it can be shown that [ bellcondition ] c ( , ) & = & c ( , - ) = -1 + c ( , ) & = & 0 = 0 . to show this , let @xmath171 be a unit vector @xmath182 , with uniform probability distribution over all directions , and a ( , ) = sign + b ( , ) = - sign .",
    "+    then one gets c ( , ) = 1 p ( ) - 1 p ( ) = - 1 + where @xmath183 is the angle between @xmath178 and @xmath174 as shown in the figure ( [ bellsinglet ] ) .",
    "this equation satisfies ( [ bellcondition ] ) .",
    "furthermore one can reproduce the quantum mechanical value in ( [ qmbell ] ) , by allowing that the result of the measurement on each particle depend also on the measurement direction of the other particle corresponding the replacement of @xmath178 with @xmath177 , which is obtained from @xmath178 by rotating towards @xmath174 until [ bellqm ] c ( , ) = - 1 + = - holds , where @xmath181 is the angle between @xmath177 and @xmath174 .",
    "however we can not permit this since we are looking for a local theory .",
    "next we turn our attention to comparing the hidden variable theory and quantum mechanics . to show the contradictions between the result of local hidden variable theory and the quantum mechanics , we proceed as follows :    since @xmath184 is normalized , we have d ( ) = 1 and for the singlet state a ( , ) = - b ( , ) .",
    "then ( [ bellcorrel ] ) can be written as c ( , ) = - d ( ) a ( , ) a ( , ) .",
    "next , we introduce another unit vector @xmath185 , and consider c ( , ) - c ( , ) & = & - d ( ) ( a ( , ) a ( , ) - a ( , ) a ( , ) ) + & = & d ( ) a ( , ) a ( , ) ( a ( , ) a ( , ) - 1 ) where we have used the fact that @xmath186 ^ 2 = 1 $ ] . since @xmath187 , this equation can be written as |c ( , ) - c ( , ) | d ( ) ( 1 - a ( , ) a ( , ) ) then finally we get [ bellineq ] 1 + c ( , ) |c ( , ) - c ( , ) | this is the original form of famous bell inequality .",
    "+    it is easy to show that for some special directions this inequality can not be satisfied by the quantum mechanical result .",
    "the bell inequality ( [ bellineq ] ) for the quantum mechanics becomes 1 - ( _ bc ) | ( _ ab ) - ( _ ac)| .",
    "one can easily see that this is not satisfied for the angles shown in figure ( [ bellangle ] ) .    as a result , introducing a variable to account for",
    "the measurement process does not correspond to the right statistical behavior of quantum mechanics .",
    "however as in the case of ( [ bellqm ] ) , if the measurement result of one of the entangled pair depends also on the measurement of the other , then it meets the quantum mechanical criteria .",
    "then this hidden variable must propagate instantaneously , but such a theory can not be lorentz invariant .",
    "+ thus , the question asked by epr is solved by j. s. bell and this solution has been verified by a. aspect in a series of experiments @xcite .",
    "after the discussion on the two historically important papers , one can describe the entanglement in terms of the postulates of quantum mechanics . according to postulate 4 , total hilbert space of the composite system",
    "is formed by tensor product of hilbert spaces of subsystems . in that total space ,",
    "there are such states that can not be written as a tensor product of states representing the subsystem .",
    "consider an n - partite composite system , and |_i _",
    "i i=1,2,3,,n then there are states in the @xmath188 such that | _",
    "i=1^n |_i .",
    "these states are called entangled states .",
    "any state that is not entangled is called separable .",
    "in this work , we only concentrate on bipartite states .",
    "consider two quantum systems , the first one is owned by alice , and the second one by bob .",
    "alice s system may be described by states in a hilbert space @xmath189 of dimension n and bob s one @xmath190 of dimension m. the composite system of both parties is then described by the vectors in the tensor - product form of the two spaces @xmath191 .",
    "let @xmath192 be a basis of alice s space and @xmath193 be basis of bob s space .",
    "then in @xmath194 we have the set of all linear combinations of the states @xmath195 to be used as bases .",

    "c_ij |a_i |b_j _ a _ b with a complex @xmath196 matrix @xmath197",
    ".    the measurement of observables can be defined in a similar way , if a is an observable on alice s space and b on bob s space , the expectation value of @xmath198 is defined as | ( a b ) | = _ i , j = 1^n , m _ i,j = 1^n , m c_ij^ * c_ij",
    "a_i| a |a_i b_j| b |b_j.    now we can define separability and entanglement for these states .",
    "a pure state @xmath199 is called a  product state \" or  separable \" if one can find states @xmath200 and @xmath201 such that @xmath202 holds .",
    "otherwise the state @xmath35 is called entangled .",
    "physically , the definition of product state means that the state is uncorrelated .",
    "thus a product state can be prepared in a local way . in other",
    "word alice produces the state @xmath203 and bob does independently @xmath204 .",
    "if alice measures any observable a and bob measures b , the measurement outcomes for alice do not depend on the outcomes on bob s side .",
    "in a pure state , it is easy to decide whether a given pure state is entangled or not . @xmath35 is a product state , if and only if the rank of the matrix @xmath197 in ( [ entanglematrix ] ) equals one .",
    "this is due to the fact that a matrix c is of rank one , if and only if there exist two vectors a and b such that @xmath205 .",
    "so one can write | = ( _ i a_i |a_i ) ( _ j b_j |b_j ) which means that it is the product state .",
    "another important tool for the description of entanglement for bipartite systems only is the schmidt decomposition , we turn our attention next :    let @xmath206 be a vector in the tensor product space of the two hilbert spaces . then there exists an orthonormal basis @xmath207 of @xmath189 and an orthonormal basis @xmath208 of @xmath190 such that | = _ i=1^r _",

    "it is worth pointing out that from schmidt form one can define the von neumann entropy which can be used as a measure of entanglement , as @xmath212 from this definition , one can easily observe that if a given state is a product state which means that the schmidt rank is equal to one in the spectral decomposition , then the von neumann entropy is zero .",
    "however for an entangled state , the von neumann entropy never vanishes .",
    "furthermore , for a maximally entangled state , the von neumann entropy is [ entropymax ] s = _",

    "bell inequality in ( [ bellineq ] ) can be written in a more elegant way . for a bipartite system , consider four dichotomous operators @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath39 , and @xmath216 which can take the values @xmath217 .",

    "this is the verification of the non local character of quantum mechanics .",
    "chsh inequality is valid for the bipartite systems and any bipartite entangled state violates this inequality in certain directions .",

    "finally we get the schmidt decomposition in terms of the creation operators as @xmath246    now we can apply lorentz transformation on our state ket by the unitary transformation @xmath247 @xmath248 using the transformation relations of the creation operators @xmath249 and the lorentz invariance of the vacuum , @xmath250 , we get @xmath251 or @xmath252 next we define @xmath253 then , the transformed state becomes @xmath254 this expression can be re - written as @xmath255 where @xmath256    it is necessary now to check whether @xmath257 forms an orthonormal basis .",
    "for this , consider @xmath258 using ( [ schmidtbasis ] ) , we get @xmath259 .",
    "this means that the transformed state is still in the schmidt decomposition form with exactly the same schmidt coefficients .",
    "this result proves the lorentz covariance of entanglement .    also note that since the schmidt coefficients do not change under lorentz transformation , the von nuemann entropy as a measure of entanglement do not increase or decrease , since @xmath260",
    "therefore , the von neumann entropy is a lorentz invariant quantity . to illustrate the invariance ,",
    "consider the transformed state ( [ firsttransform ] ) , it can be written in the schmidt form as , & & u ( ) |^+ = + & & \\ { ( _ w ) a^ ( , ) + ( _ w ) a^ ( , - ) } a^((- ) , ) + & + & \\ { ( _ w ) a^ ( , - ) - ( _ w ) a^ ( , ) } a^((- ) , - ) where the bases satisfies ( [ schmidtbasis ] ) . then the von neumann entropy is s= - ( _ 2 ( ) + _ 2 ( ) ) = 1 which is agree with ( [ entropy1 ] ) .",
    "now we turn our attention to the calculation of the correlation function c ( , ) = , for the state ( [ transfentangle ] ) .",
    "there is an easy way of calculating this correlation function by using the properties of entangled states , which is _",
    "i |^+ & = & b_ij_2_j |^+ + _ i |^- & = & - _ 2_i |^- , where @xmath261 then , using ( [ spinmult ] ) the correlation function becomes [ correlationcross ] c ( , ) = a_i b_j \\ { ^2(_w)b_ij - ^2(_w ) _ ij - ( _ ijk^+|_k|^",

    "@xmath262 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    now we are ready to test the locality condition by using chsh inequality chsh = | c ( , ) + c ( , ) + c ( , ) - c ( , ) | 2",
    ". one can choose the measurement directions as the following [ directions ] & = & ( 1/,-1/ , 0 ) + & = & ( -1/,-1/,0 ) + & = & ( 0,1,0 ) + & = & ( 1,0,0 ) corresponding to the case that they give maximum violation in the non relativistic limit .",
    "then one obtains the result of the @xmath0 as [ initalchsh ] chsh = ( 1 + ( 2 _ w ) ) . using ( [ wigangle ] )",
    ", this result can be defined in terms of the particle velocity @xmath263 and the velocity of the boosted frame @xmath262 , as chsh = 2 ( ) .",
    "from these two equivalent results , it can be deduced that in the non relativistic domain , @xmath263 and @xmath264 , as shown in the figure ( [ chsh ] ) , we get the maximum violation as expected , however violation of the inequality starts before the ultra relativistic limit contrary to the claim in @xcite , in which they use the spin operator defined in @xcite . also note that if the boost direction is parallel or anti - parallel to the direction of the particle as seen by the zero momentum frame , then there is no wigner rotation , and we get the maximum violation as in @xcite .",
    "in this thesis , we have investigated the entanglement problem in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "entanglement lies at the heart of the quantum mechanics due to its non local character . in this sense",
    ", studying its properties in the framework of special relativity is crucial . for this purpose",
    ", we have first constructed the unitary irreducible representation of poincar group in the infinite dimensional hilbert space . in this framework ,",
    "the issue of finding the unitary irreducible representations of poincar group is reduced to that of the little group .",
    "namely in this formalism poincar group reduces to the three dimensional rotation group for the massive cases , entangled states in different but equivalent frames undergo a wigner rotation which changes its spin polarization direction .    on the other hand ,",
    "since there are some ambiguities on the correct relativistic operator in the literature , we have critically studied physical requirements on it .",
    "spin statistics must be a frame - independent property , and therefore square of the correct three - spin operator should be lorentz invariant as implied by the second casimir operator of poincar group .    specifically , we have analyzed the bell states under lorentz transformations .",
    "although these entangled states can mix , we have shown that the entanglement is a lorentz invariant phenomena .",
    "this invariance has been shown for any entangled bipartite system by starting from the schmidt decomposition .",
    "then we have calculated the correlation function for the transformed states .",
    "using the correlation , we have constructed the @xmath0 inequality . at the first glance",
    ", @xmath0 inequality seems to be satisfied for certain wigner angles that depends on both the velocity of the particle and velocity of the boosted frame relative to the zero momentum frame of the entangled state .",
    "however , it is an illusion since changes in the velocities cause changes in the wigner angle that can affect the superposition of the entangled states which violate the @xmath0 inequality in different directions .",
    "thus , it is natural that the initial dichotomous operators may satisfy the inequality for these entangled states .",
    "this confusing situation can be solved radically by performing the epr experiment with the wigner angle dependent dichotomous operators . as a result ,",
    "lorentz transformed entangled states still violates the bell type inequalities in certain directions that may depend on the wigner angle .",
