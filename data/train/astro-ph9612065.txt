    "the study of spectral absorption features provides a direct test of the possible presence of young stellar population in brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg s ) immersed in cooling flow clusters ( sarazin 1986 ) . cooling flows",
    "have been revealed in x - rays studies , but so far work in the optical has failed to produce substantial _ direct _ evidence for their presence ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "the mechanism(s ) responsible for the connection , if any , between the emission line regions usually found at the centers of many cooling flow galaxies , the blue excess , and the cooling flow phenomenon itself remain unclear ( baum 1992 , fabian 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "line - strength gradients are a powerful tool to investigate the radial distribution of stellar populations in galaxies",
    ". they could be a measurement of the amount of dissipation that occurred during the star formation phase in the galaxies ( see gonzlez & gorgas 1996 for a recent review on spectroscopic gradients in early - type galaxies ) .",
    "typically , metallic line - strengths decrease outwards in elliptical galaxies , which has conventionally been interpreted as a decrement of metallicity with radius ( faber 1977 ) .",
    "however , age effects may also play an important role ( aragn , gorgas & rego 1987 ; gorgas , efstathiou & aragn - salamanca 1990 ; gonzlez 1993 , faber _",
    "et al . _ 1995 ) .",
    "the application of evolutionary population synthesis models can help to disentangle this degeneracy between age and metallicity ( worthey 1994 ) . in this talk",
    ", we highlight results derived from an extension of the work presented in cardiel , gorgas & aragn - salamanca ( 1995 ) after the inclusion of extensive new spectroscopic data , obtained with the wht .",
    "we have measured line - strength gradients in a sample of 18 galaxies ( 13 in clusters with cooling flows and 5 in clusters without ) .",
    "we concentrate here on the study of the mg@xmath0 index and the 4000  break .",
    "both spectral features are good indicators of changes in the stellar populations of early - type galaxies and can be measured in spectra with relatively low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "this last property is important when trying to obtain reliable measurements out to @xmath2 , where the surface brightness of a typical bcg is only a few per cent of the sky brightness . in figure  1",
    "we show 4000  gradients for six galaxies in our sample .",
    "mg@xmath0 has been extensively studied by gorgas _",
    "( 1993 ) and worthey _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , who derived empirical fitting functions to model the behavior of this spectral feature with the stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "d@xmath1 is quite sensitive to the temperature of the main - sequence turn - off ( hamilton 1985 , dressler & shectman 1987 ) , although its dependence on metallicity is not negligible ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "the corresponding fitting functions for this feature are under construction ( gorgas & cardiel 1996 ) .",
    "when these empirical calibrations are incorporated into stellar population models ( worthey 1994 , charlot & bruzual 1996 ) , we will be able to interpret the observed line - strengths in terms of mean age and metallicity of the stellar populations .",
    "it is important to note that the balmer - line indices ( h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 , or h@xmath6 ) , widely used as age discriminators for stellar population in elliptical galaxies ( gonzlez 1993 , rose 1994 , faber _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , jones & worthey 1995 ) , are useless for such purpose here since , in many cases , prominent emission prevents the observation of the underlying absorption features in cooling flow galaxies . moreover , in order to get reliable line indices , emission lines within the mg@xmath0 and d@xmath1 bandpasses ( e.g. [ neiii ] @xmath73869 , [ sii ] @xmath84069,4076 , h@xmath9 , [ oiii ] @xmath74959 , [ ni ] @xmath75200 ) must be carefully removed ( see details in cardiel , gorgas & aragn - salamanca 1996 ) prior to any measurement",
    "full details of the new galaxy sample and measurements will be given in a forthcoming paper ( cardiel , _ et al .",
    "we summarize here the main results which emerge from this study .    * centralkpc for @xmath10km@xmath11s@xmath12mpc@xmath13 . ] mg@xmath0 and d@xmath1 measurements in cooling flow galaxies _ with emission lines _ are well correlated with mass deposition rate , in the sense that both indices decrease suggesting the presence of a young stellar population when the mass flow increases .",
    "similar correlations of central blue colors and spectral features with mass rates have been previously reported by different authors : johnstone , fabian & nulsen ( 1987 ) found a correlation between the d@xmath1 and the mass flow rate @xmath14 within their spectrograph slit ; mcnamara & oconnell ( 1989 ) presented a correlation between their @xmath9ub ( which is well correlated with d@xmath1 ) and the normalized rate of mass drop out in the nucleus per unit luminosity @xmath15 ; finally , mcnamara & oconnell ( 1992 ) showed that the strength and extend of bluer central colors are more prominent for central galaxies in clusters with high mass accretion rates . *",
    "interestingly , nuclear indices in the cooling flow galaxies of our sample _ without _ emission lines ( e.g. a  644 , a  2142 ) _ do not _ follow this correlation with @xmath16 , which is also the case for a  2029 in the @xmath9ub@xmath15 diagram from mcnamara & oconnell ( 1989 )",
    ". the central line - strengths of bcg s in both clusters without cooling flows and cooling flow galaxies without emission lines are consistent with the values observed in giant ellipticals . *",
    "the central line - strengths of elliptical galaxies define a relatively narrow trend in the d@xmath1mg@xmath0 plane ( kimble , davidsen & sandage 1989 ) .",
    "however , central mg@xmath0 and d@xmath1 measurements in cooling flow galaxies exhibit a clear correlation ( see figure  5 in cardiel _",
    "_ 1995 ) which departs from the locus where giant elliptical galaxies are found .",
    "the inclusion of new galaxies in our sample has revealed that there is a clear dichotomy in the way cooling flow galaxies with emission lines populate this plane .",
    "galaxies with central emission - line nebulae of class ii ( following the scheme of heckman _",
    "_ 1989 ) , e.g. pks  9745@xmath17191 , hydra  a , a  1795 , a  2597 , exhibit the largest departures from the elliptical galaxy region in the d@xmath1mg@xmath0 diagram . when compared with stellar population model predictions this provides strong evidence for recent star formation in these galaxies . *",
    "although line - strength gradients are usually found to be linear with @xmath18 in elliptical galaxies ( gonzlez & gorgas 1996 ) , mg@xmath0 and d@xmath1 gradients in some cooling flow galaxies exhibit a clear slope change at intermediate radii ( cardiel _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . with the inclusion of new spectroscopic data",
    ", we find that this change of slope is only evident for galaxies with emission lines ( figure  1 ) .",
    "* cooling flow galaxies _ with emission lines _",
    "exhibit flat and even positive gradients in the region where the emission is detected .",
    "in fact , these inner gradients seem to be correlated with mass deposition rate ( i.e. , more positive with increasing @xmath16 ; see figure  2 ) . in the outer parts of these galaxies , where emission is not observed , the derived mean",
    "line - strength gradients are consistent with those in elliptical galaxies .",
    "* mean gradients in galaxies with cooling flows but _ without emission lines _ are similar to those in galaxies without cooling flows and those in elliptical galaxies ( figure  3 ) .",
    "@xmath19 * blue excess and emission lines . *",
    "previous work has shown that in the central parts of massive cooling flows the emission line luminosity correlates with the blue light excess ( johnstone _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 , allen _",
    "_ 1992 , crawford & fabian 1993 , crawford _ et al .",
    "in addition , the emission line flux is co - spatial with the excess blue light ( e.g. romanishin 1987 , hansen , j@xmath20rgensen & n@xmath20rgaard - nielsen 1995 ) .",
    "our mg@xmath0 and d@xmath1 gradients confirm that the spatial extent of the excess blue light is very similar to the emission line region ( figure  1 ) .",
    "these results indicate that , very likely , both processes are physically related .",
    "however this is a question of open debate ( see discussion in baum 1992 , fabian 1994 , and references therein ) . using blue optical spectra and iue data ,",
    "crawford & fabian ( 1993 ) showed that the spectrum of the excess blue light is consistent with both star formation and a power - law spectrum .",
    "allen ( 1995 ) , using simple stellar population models , suggested that young stars are responsible of the spatially extended excess uv / blue continua .",
    "our analysis of central mg@xmath0 and d@xmath1 measurements in a sample of bcg s with and without cooling flows using bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) stellar population models suggests the observed correlation between both indices can be reproduced with star formation at a constant rate over the last few gyrs ( cardiel _ et al .",
    "however , further work in the stellar population modelling is still needed to definitely rule out a power - law spectrum as the origin of the blue excess .",
    "@xmath19 * the cooling flow connection . *",
    "the presence of emission lines must be in some way related to cooling flows since h@xmath3 ( johnstone _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) and h@xmath21 luminosity ( heckman _ et al . _ 1989 ) are correlated with mass deposition rate . however , considering the high scatter in line luminosities for a given @xmath16 , the relationship does not seem to be a simple one ( baum 1992 ) .",
    "whichever mechanism is responsible for the dilution of the measured line - strength indices ( star formation , scattering of nuclear light , etc . )",
    ", the correlations of the mass deposition rate with central indices and line - strength gradients in the emission line regions add further weight to the idea of a link between the blue excess and the cooling flow phenomenon .",
    "nevertheless , as crawford & fabian ( 1993 ) pointed out , the fact that there are central galaxies ( e.g. a  644 , a  2029 ) in clusters with high @xmath16 but without blue excess suggests that the cooling flow alone can not be responsible for the blue light .",
    "these authors also noted the existence of strong cooling flow galaxies , with ( e.g. a  478 ) and without ( e.g. a  2029 ) emission - line nebulae , which apparently did not exhibit a blue continuum excess .",
    "however , our d@xmath1 gradient in the central galaxy of a  478 ( figure 1 ) does exhibit a clear positive behaviour ( i.e. blue excess ) in the emission line region .",
    "a larger sample is needed to test whether there are any cooling flow galaxies with line - emission nebulae which do not exhibit blue excess , and vice versa .",
    "we thank the organizing committee for making possible this meeting .",
    "the wht is operated on the island of la palma by the royal greenwich observatory at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
