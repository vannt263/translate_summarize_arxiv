    "cataclysmic variables ( cv ) are formed when the wd made during a common envelope event finally comes into contact with its companion as a result of gravitational radiation losses over a few gyr ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the wd will have cooled during this time ; a @xmath2 he wd would have @xmath3 at 4 gyr @xcite , whereas a @xmath4 c / o wd would have @xmath5 in 4 gyr @xcite .",
    "these give effective temperatures @xmath6 k.    a subset of the cvs , called dwarf novae ( dn ) , contain a wd accreting at low time - averaged rates @xmath7 , where the accretion disk is subject to a thermal instability which causes it to rapidly transfer matter onto the wd ( at @xmath8 ) for a week once every month to year .",
    "the @xmath9 onto the wd is often low enough between outbursts that the uv emission is dominated by the internal luminosity of the wd , allowing for a measurement of the wd luminosity , yielding @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the wd is clearly hotter than expected for its age , providing evidence of the thermal impact of prolonged accretion @xcite .",
    "the theoretical illumination of this phenomena will aid our understanding of cv evolution , ejection of material during cn events , and finally allow for theoretical seismology of the one known non - radial pulsator , gw lib @xcite .",
    "we summarize here both our published work @xcite and work in progress .",
    "at low @xmath11 s , the energy from accretion onto the wd surface is radiated away near the photosphere and does not penetrate the interior .",
    "we are thus concerned about energy released deep within the wd , far beneath the photosphere .",
    "compressional heating is the energy released by fluid elements as they are buried by further accretion .",
    "energy is released because the time it takes a fluid element to move inward is much longer than the time for heat transport .",
    "hence , the fluid element loses entropy as it moved inward , adjusting its temperature to the profile needed to carry the exiting flux .",
    "an estimate of the energy released this way is just the gravitational energy liberated as a fluid element moves down in the wd s gravitational field , @xmath12 . in the outer atmosphere ,",
    "a fluid element moves a scale height , @xmath13 , in the time it takes to replace it by accretion , giving @xmath14 .",
    "this has the correct scaling , notably the dependence on @xmath15 which is a contrasting parameter between the accreted h / he envelope and the c / o core .",
    "our previous work @xcite showed that the dominant energy release is in the accreted outer envelope , giving @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean molecular weight of the accreted material .",
    "an additional energy source is slow nuclear `` simmering '' near the base of the accreted layer .",
    "this is significant when the layer becomes thick , eventually becoming thermally unstable to ignite the cn .",
    "the cn energy is assumed to be radiated away in the explosion .",
    "however , the nuclear simmering prior to the cn releases an amount of energy comparable to that from compression . because of unstable nuclear burning and the resulting cn cycle , the h / he envelope mass changes with time .",
    "this allows the core to cool at low accumulated masses and be heated prior to unstable ignition @xcite .",
    "we use cn ignition to determine the maximum mass of the overlying freshly accreted shell , and find the steady - state ( i.e. cooling equals heating throughout the cn cycle ) core temperature , @xmath1 , as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath18 .",
    "the left panel in figure 1 shows the resulting @xmath1 and maximum accumulated mass as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "these masses should be compared to measured ejection masses in order to learn if the wd is losing or gaining mass during cn outburst .",
    "= 2.32 in = 2.32 in",
    "using the compressional heating estimate previously given , we now show why we think there is enough time for a c / o wd to reach @xmath19 .",
    "the specific heat of the liquid wd core is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the ion mean molecular weight for the c / o core .",
    "when the core is colder than @xmath1 , it is heated by the envelope at the rate @xmath22 which we equate to the changing thermal content of a fixed mass core ( presuming all accreted matter is ejected during the cn ) .",
    "this gives the time evolution @xmath23 , where the time coordinate is @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the total mass transferred .",
    "the large prefactor ( due to the contrast in the @xmath15 s ) allows the core temperature to match @xmath1 to within 5 percent when @xmath26 , which is easily satisfied by cv evolution .",
    "disequilibrium can occur if the accreting wd is mostly helium , as then @xmath27 and the specific heat is large .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows our predicted @xmath28 range during the @xmath29 year cn cycle as a function of @xmath11 for wd cores with @xmath1 .",
    "clearly our predictions are in the observed range noted earlier .",
    "we also show on this plot the typical @xmath30 range of the non - radial zz ceti pulsators , making it clear that the discovery of more such systems is expected . comparing our calculations to dn systems below the period gap , @xmath31",
    "imply that the wd masses are in the range @xmath32-@xmath33 .",
    "this agrees with the expectation from @xcite , who find @xmath34 at an orbital period of 2 hours presuming angular momentum losses from gravitational radiation . above the period gap ,",
    "the observed @xmath28 is higher , and we find @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath11 contrast above and below the period gap qualitatively confirms the `` standard '' model of cv evolution with disrupted magnetic braking ( see @xcite for an updated discussion ) .",
    "there remain many unanswered questions that we hope to address .",
    "our current modeling efforts are spherically symmetric and we are often asked if disk accretion can make a difference .",
    "we think not , since the depth of the matter when it ignites is so large that it should have covered the whole star by that time .",
    "detailed comparisons to nearby dn with accurate @xmath30 s need to be undertaken by us in conjunction with the observers .",
    "in addition , the current @xmath28 measurement of gw lib @xcite puts it outside the zz ceti strip for @xmath36 , reminding us that we have alot to learn about non - radial oscillations in these very perturbed wds .",
