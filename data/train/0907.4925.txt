    "it is straightforward to check that the determination of the coefficients associated with the various elements of the two - qubit density matrix resulting from the interaction with the non - gaussian cv resource tracks the steps depicted in sec .",

    "the presence of the square - root factor reflects the effects of de - gaussification process .",
    "this result demonstrates our claim that the entanglement - transfer capabilities of an @xmath0-photon subtracted state , under the model for local hamiltonian addressed within the context of this work , are determined by the knowledge of the gaussian  core \" of the state and , of course , the number of photons being subtracted .",
    "our task now becomes manyfold .",
    "first , we aim at showing that a non - gaussian resource obtained from a two - mode squeezed state , which is a realistic and interesting case to study  @xcite , beats the corresponding gaussian resource only for proper choices of the squeezing parameter @xmath86 . however , the maximum value of entanglement transferred by a de - gaussified state for @xmath145 $ ] , which is a reasonable time to wait , never exceeds the one achieved via a gaussian resource .",
    "this strongly contrasts with the entanglement of the state itself : the negativity of an @xmath0-photon subtracted two - mode squeezed state is larger than the one for @xmath146 , regardless of @xmath147 and @xmath148 . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we indicate with @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) the transferred negativity when a gaussian ( de - gaussified ) cv resource is used . in fig .",
    "[ differenza ] we show the difference between the entanglement @xmath151 transferred upon usage of a gaussian two - mode squeezed state and @xmath150 when a @xmath6-photon subtracted two - mode squeezed state is employed .",
    "such a difference is evaluated at set values of the dimensionless interaction time @xmath66 and the degree of squeezing of the gaussian - core resource .",
    "we notice a rich structure of maxima and minima .",
    "notably , with the exception of the three dark areas in the region of small @xmath86 , witnessing that the use of the non - gaussian resource favors the transfer of entanglement to the remote two - level systems , such a difference remains largely non - negative throughout the entire region determined by @xmath145 $ ] and @xmath152 $ ] .",
    "the results are thus clear : the use of a gaussian cv resource is ( almost always ) much more effective than a non - gaussian state ( belonging to the class of de - gaussified states studied here ) when entanglement transfer processes are addressed .",
    "this qualitative behavior holds for any value of @xmath0 tested by our calculations .",

    "( [ modificati ] ) , which deeply affects the interferences among components associated with fixed numbers of excitations , is the reason for such a considerable change in behavior of the discrete - variable entanglement function .",
    "the squashing towards regions of lower squeezing originates from the modifications induced by photon - subtraction on the photon - number probability distributions of the states being used : as @xmath0 grows , such probability distributions are peaked at smaller @xmath86 and their width shrinks with respect to what occurs for the @xmath146 case , thus explaining the behavior observed in figs .",

    "they have been used in order to evaluate the maximum qubit entanglement ( for @xmath145 $ ] ) that can be achieved by using such fully gaussian resources and the @xmath0-photon subtracted states having the latter as gaussian core ( with @xmath155 ) .",
    "the result is that , quite clearly , gaussian states are able to achieve the largest discrete - variable entanglement , as far as the model for bilocal interaction discussed here is considered . moreover , the successive subtraction of photons reduces the maximum of entanglement being transferrable .",

    "general considerations in the theory of cv entanglement reveal that the gaussian state having , as covariance matrix entries , the moments ( up to the second ) of a general two - mode cv state , provides a lower bound to the entanglement content of the latter . in this sense , gaussian states are said to be `` extremal ''  @xcite . recently",

    "<S> we draw an explicit connection between the statistical properties of an entangled two - mode continuous variable ( cv ) resource and the amount of entanglement that can be dynamically transferred to a pair of non - interacting two - level systems . more specifically , we rigorously reformulate entanglement transfer process by making use of covariance matrix formalism . </S>",
    "<S> when the resource state is gaussian , our method makes the approach to the transfer of quantum correlations much more flexible than in previously considered schemes and allows the straightforward inclusion of the effects of noise affecting the cv system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the proposed method reveals that the use of de - gaussified two - mode states is almost never advantageous for transferring entanglement with respect to the full gaussian picture , despite the entanglement in the non - gaussian resource can be much larger than in its gaussian counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus conclude that the entanglement - transfer map overthrows the  ordering \" relations valid at the level of cv resource states .    </S>",
    "<S> lica.it    </S>",
    "<S> the establishment of a long - haul entangled channel is one of the most important and challenging aims of that part of quantum technology concerned with communication and distributed computation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of experimental and theoretical efforts that have been put into the design and realization of a device allowing such a result with a sufficient degree of reliability is tremendous  @xcite . among the rich plethora of schemes put forward so far , an intellectually stimulating and pragmatically inspiring proposal relies on the possibility to quantum mechanically </S>",
    "<S> correlate two remote systems by _ transferring _ some pre - available entanglement initially carried by a resource  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this stems as a rather natural way of achieving a distributed channel for quantum communication , especially when the entangled resource is embodied by the continuous variable ( cv ) state of a photonic system , which has been proven to be a reliable courier of quantum correlations . in fact , such an idea has been implemented , recently , in a setup involving cold atomic ensembles and light fields  @xcite .    despite the scheme is attracting an increasing attention also in virtue of its versatile nature , which makes it suitable for implementations in various settings , including cavity and circuit quantum - electrodynamics , the formalism itself is largely in need of development . in its basic form , </S>",
    "<S> the protocol requires the arrangement of a bilocal interaction between each remote qubit and one of the modes of the cv photonic resource . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to arrange a situation suitable to the _ pouring _ of quantum correlations from the cv resource to the non - interacting two - level systems in such a way that , upon tracing out the two modes , we are left with an entangled state of the qubits . in this procedure </S>",
    "<S> , it is often the case that the explicit form of the cv resource , decomposed in some basis , is needed . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the computational efforts required for the evaluation of the degree of transferred entanglement quite demanding . and </S>",
    "<S> yet , it is rather sensible to believe that asking for the full cv state decomposition is probably not at all necessary , especially if one considers the class of gaussian entangled two - mode states , which are fully determined by assigning only a few of their statistical properties . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly the main point of the present investigation : we develop a self - consistent formal approach that is able to reconstruct the entries of the two - qubit density matrix resulting from the entanglement transfer process simply by means of statistical properties of the pre - built resource . </S>",
    "<S> this represents the first step of a theoretical investigation directed towards the generalization and extension of the _ panorama _ of situations where entanglement transfer can be conveniently and almost effortlessly studied . </S>",
    "<S> this includes also the experimentally important case of non - gaussian cv resources having the form of @xmath0-photon subtracted two mode states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed formalism allows us to quantitatively study the performance of this class of states in relation to the tasks discussed here .    </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ prelim ] we lay down the notation and recall some basic definitions and tools useful for the treatment of cv systems . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gaussiano ] we attack the case of entanglement transfer from a resource prepared in a general gaussian state . </S>",
    "<S> we give explicit expressions for the elements of the two - qubit reduced density matrix resulting from the transfer process as functions of the statistical moments of the resource . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight their theoretical and computational convenience by addressing a general two - mode squeezed thermal state , which allows us to unveil the spoiling effect , on the degree of transferred entanglement , of the resource s thermal character . </S>",
    "<S> a similar study is then performed with respect to a dissipation - affected two - mode squeezed state : in both cases we demonstrate that the degree of _ poured _ entanglement is set once the resource is assigned . </S>",

    "<S> [ nongaussiano ] tackles the case of experimentally relevant non - gaussian states obtained by subtracting @xmath0 photons symmetrically from a two - mode squeezed state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a series of results are achieved in this case : first , we demonstrate that the gaussian core of the photon - subtracted resource ( _ i.e. _ its statistical moments up to the second ) completely specifies the amount of transferred entanglement . however , the use of such a non - gaussian state is not always advantageous with respect to its gaussian counterpart ( obtained by not subtracting photons ) : despite photon - subtraction works as an entanglement distillation protocol for the cv state , a two - mode gaussian state is almost always a more efficient resource for entanglement transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we also draw some conjectures on the relation between the discrepancy in the performances of gaussian - associated and original non - gaussian states and the degree of non - gaussianity of a resource  @xcite . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ conclusioni ] we summarize our findings and highlight the procedure for adapting our technique to the recently proposed protocol for entanglement reciprocation  @xcite . </S>",
