    "one of the early puzzles in the initial electronic structure calculations of the iron - arsenide based superconductors was the difficulty in reconciling the magnetic moment calculated using density functional theory ( dft ) and the experimental fe - as distance . from these early calculations it was evident that the fe magnetic moment was extremely sensitive to this distance , suggesting remarkably strong magnetoelastic coupling in this family of materials @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it was shown that the hypothetical compound tlfe@xmath1se@xmath1 should also exhibit strong magnetoelastic coupling,@xcite although experimentally the fe layer is never completely filled .",

    "the vacancies in the fe layer can order , as was first discussed by sabrowsky @xcite and hggstrm.@xcite hggstrm et al.@xcite found that in tlfe@xmath0se@xmath1 , vacancies in the fe layer order forming a @xmath11 superstructure with the supercell (  ) related to the subcell by _ * a*_ = 2__*a * _ _ + _ * b * _ , _ * b*_ = -_*a * _ + 2__*b * _ _ , _ * c*_ = _ * c * _ , based on the tetragonal thcr@xmath1si@xmath1 subcell with lattice constant _ * a * _ and _ * c * _ ( see fig .

    "the nominal starting composition was tl:2fe:2se .",

    "the silica ampoule was placed in the furnace to use the small natural temperature gradient of the box furnace .",
    "careful single crystal x - ray and neutron refinements indicate that for as the as - grown crystals , whose properties are discussed in this manuscript , the vacancies are not completely ordered ( see table [ tab : refine ] ) in spite of slow cooling . whether different heat treatments in the 150@xmath16c to 400@xmath16c temperature range can significantly change",
    "the degree of vacancy ordering requires further investigation .",
    "we note , however , that if the crystals are cooled too quickly from 1070@xmath16c to room temperature , the two phase transitions at 140 and 100k are not visible in resistivity data .",
    "single crystal plates with typical dimensions of 5 @xmath12 5 @xmath12 2 mm@xmath17 could be easily cleaved from the solidified boule . because of the potential toxicity of tl compounds , the samples were always handled with gloves , and often under a hood .",

    "if the high temperature susceptibility data is extrapolated to temperatures above 300k , the intersection of a linear extrapolation for each direction occurs near 450k .",

    "although it is difficult to reliably interpret hall data from multiband magnetic materials , the three order of magnitude drop in apparent carrier concentration between 150k and 50k is consistent with the three order of magnitude increase in the resistivity over this same temperature interval .",

    "the crystal structure could be described using the tetragonal thcr@xmath1si@xmath1 structure with an additional superstructure to account for the partial ordering of fe vacancies in the basal plane .",

    "<S> the phase transitions at @xmath6 and @xmath7 result in significant changes in the magnetic moment per iron , with 1.72(6)@xmath8 observed at 300k , 2.07(9)@xmath8 at 140k , 1.90(9)@xmath8 at 115k , and 1.31(8)@xmath8 for 5k if the same `` block checkerboard '' magnetic structure is used at all temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transitions appear to be driven by small changes in the _ * c * _ lattice constant , large magnetoelastic coupling , and the localization of carriers with decreasing temperature . </S>"
