    "the search for new particles and interactions beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been challenging high - energy physics , both theoretical and experimental , over the recent decades.the results from the lhc s atlas- and cms - collaborations may point to the existence of a ( new ) fifth interaction @xcite .",
    "analysing data of @xmath4-collisions at a center - of - mass energy scale of @xmath5 has revealed the masses for the heavy@xmath6- and @xmath7-bosons @xcite , which may be evidence for new physics communicated from very high energies to the @xmath8-scale .",
    "we should keep in mind that the introduction of an extra higgs may be needed to explain the heavy mass of the new bosons at the @xmath8-scale .",
    "these masses are associated to a new range of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of supplementary higgs scalars .    a well - known model in this direction",
    "is based on an @xmath9-gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "the extra @xmath10-subgroup is introduced to account for the new @xmath6- and @xmath7-bosons , besides the already known @xmath11- and @xmath12-weak mediators of the glashow - salam - weinberg ( gsw ) model .",
    "the right - handed sector also introduces fermion doublets with a charged lepton and its associated neutrino of right chirality .",
    "two scalars doublets constitute the higgs content so that the gauge bosons acquire their masses .",
    "the first one is introduced to break the @xmath13-gauge symmetry at the vev scale-@xmath14 , above the electroweak scale @xmath15 . as a consequence",
    ", the hypercharge , @xmath16 , appears as a combination of generators of @xmath13 .",
    "next , the standard model higgs breaks the remaining gauge symmetry to yield the electromagnetic interaction , @xmath17 .",
    "the scheme of these two spontaneous symmetry breaking is represented by @xmath18 where @xmath14 is a vev bringing the @xmath8-scale of the lhc experiments .",
    "more recently , in a particular nuclear physics experiment , anomalies in the decay of the excited state of @xmath19 to its ground state have suggested the existence of a new neutral boson , @xmath20 , through the decay mode @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20-boson immediately decays into an electron - positron pair @xmath22 .",
    "it is a vector - type spin-1 particle , like the photon , with mass around @xmath23 .",
    "its origin could in principle be traced back to an extra gauge symmetry , @xmath24 , in addition to the symmetries of the sm .",
    "the discovery of the x - boson may be pointing to the existence of a fifth fundamental interaction in the nature .",
    "the effective lagrangian proposed to describe this extra boson is @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the current coupled to @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 could be any fermion of the sm .",
    "the @xmath27-boson can also have a chiral interaction with the sm leptons via an axial current @xcite @xmath30 here , the parameter @xmath31 mixes the @xmath27-boson with the usual electromagnetic ( em ) photon , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the field - strength tensor for @xmath27 , and @xmath34 , the corresponding tensor field of the photon .",
    "it is clear that the massive term spoils the @xmath24-symmetry , and the lagrangian exhibits only em gauge symmetry , @xmath35 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we take a different path and we propose a description based on an @xmath0-gauge symmetry .",
    "endowing the model with a spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) mechanism spoils one of abelian factors present in @xmath36 , so that a non - zero mass , @xmath37 , like in ( [ leff ] ) can be generated .",
    "consequently , the experimental value of @xmath38 defines the scale of a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , and we can estimate a range of mass for the extra higgs field that came in .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath39-group allows to include a new charged fermion , in addition to the leptons and quarks of the sm .",
    "the same vev responsible for a non - trivial @xmath37 also gives mass to the new charged fermion .",
    "there is also in the literature a great deal of interest on the activity related to the phenomenology of hidden sector para - photons @xcite .",
    "the para - photon is a neutral vector boson with a sub - ev mass and with the property of electromagnetic interactions with coupling constants referred to as millicharges .",
    "the para - photons are characterized by a mixed mass term with the photon and they appear with an extra gauge factor @xmath40 in the full symmetry group .    based on the model built up to describe the hidden sector para - photon , our attempt in this contribution consists in setting up a gauge model with an @xmath0-symmetry group that is twofold , according to the symmetry - breaking pattern .",
    "there are two higgs scalars and , as we shall see , there can occur two situations : the extra higgs breaks the extra symmetry @xmath40 above or below the @xmath3 electroweak scale .",
    "these two possibilities open up new scenarios that may accommodate the extra higgs an its associated extra gauge boson in different scales : @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath8-scales , according to the choice of the three parameters .",
    "the organization of this paper follows the outline below : in section , ii we present the model based on an @xmath0-symmetry . sectors of fermions and scalar bosons are introduce with quantum numbers consistent with gauge invariance .",
    "section iii is divided in two subsections .",
    "the first one is devoted to introduce the scalars fields as the higgs sector to identify the hypercharge . in the second subsection",
    ", we obtain the masses of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the new particles as well ; we also identify the basis of physical fields .",
    "section iv is also divided in two subsections , where we work out the renormalized propagators and the interactions of @xmath11- , @xmath12- , @xmath43- and @xmath20-bosons with the fermions .",
    "we also present results for the mass of the @xmath20-boson and we estimate the mass of the extra higgs in a scenario of @xmath8-scale .",
    "section vi exhibits the interpretation of the higgs model at a lower scale , the @xmath41-scale , which also is useful to contemplate para - photons . finally , our concluding comments are cast in section vii .",
    "in this section , we introduce the sector of gauge fields and fermions of the model @xmath0-model we shall discuss in the sequel .",
    "the fermion lagrangian reads as follows below : @xmath44 where we have introduced the new @xmath45-fermion associated to the @xmath39-group ; the notation @xmath46 indicates the usual leptons of the sm , _ i. e. _ , @xmath47 .",
    "the slashed notation corresponds to the contraction of the covariant derivatives with the usual dirac s matrices @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath45-fermion can be interpreted as a hidden ( dark matter ) fermion .",
    "the covariant derivatives acting on the fermions of the model are cast below : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the gauge fields of @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the abelian gauge field of @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the similar one to @xmath39 .",
    "here , we have chosen the symbol @xmath55 to represent the generator of @xmath53 , @xmath56 is the generator of @xmath39 , and the pauli matrices @xmath57 satisfy the lie algebra @xmath58=i \\ , \\varepsilon^{abc } \\ , \\frac{\\sigma^{c}}{2 } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ dmupsi ] ) , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are dimensionless gauge couplings .",
    "as usual , @xmath62 describes a doublet with a charged lepton and its neutrino partner ( both left - handed ) .",
    "it transforms under the fundamental representation of @xmath51 as @xmath63 under the abelian factors , @xmath53 and @xmath39 , these fermions transform as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are arbitrary functions of the space - time . defining the following gauge transformations @xmath68 where @xmath69 ; the covariant derivatives undergo the following transformations : @xmath70 in the sector of gauge fields , the corresponding field - strength tensors are defined by @xmath71   \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ b_{\\mu\\nu } \\!&=&\\ !",

    "its currently estimated value is @xmath76 for models that discuss hidden photons as dark matter @xcite . with the field transformations shown above ,",
    "the action is clearly @xmath0-invariant .",
    "the interactions that emerge from ( [ lleptons ] ) reveal how the leptons / neutrinos of the sm and the fermion-@xmath45 of the dark sector interact with the all vector gauge fields of the model .",
    "we can initially write these interactions as @xmath77 where we have defined @xmath78 , for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath29-field stands for any fermion of the model : @xmath79 in which @xmath80 for @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "the previous expression motivates us to define the charged bosons @xmath11 in the usual manner , i.e. , @xmath83 , which defines the interaction between leptons / neutrinos and bosons @xmath11 . in terms of the interaction involving leptons , neutrinos , fermion-@xmath45 and neutral bosons",
    "we can observe the need to define which one is the hypercharge generator of the model .",
    "this task will be done with help of a higgs sector . in the next section",
    ", we shall work out the higgs sector in association with the hypercharge generator ; the higgses are so arranged to break the @xmath36-symmetry in such a way that the abelian boson and the fermion of the hidden sector both acquire mass . here",
    ", we anticipate that this breaking shall be re - assessed in a different scenario , characterized by an energy scale much lower to the usual electroweak breaking scale .",
    "we have , up to now , proposed the general features of an abelian gauge model to describe a possible sector of new particles beyond sm .",
    "this model exhibits an @xmath84-gauge symmetry . in this section ,",
    "we work out the higgs sector , where two independent scalar fields are introduced ; one of them will break the abelian subgroup to give mass to the @xmath20-boson .",
    "furthermore , these scalars justify a fundamental origin of the hypercharge generator . after the first spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb )",
    "takes place , the residual ( unbroken ) symmetry is given by @xmath85 where the @xmath86-group comes out as the mixing of the @xmath53- and @xmath39-subgroups .",
    "we denote this higgs field by @xmath87 .",
    "we next introduce a second higgs field , @xmath88 , to break the residual electroweak @xmath89-symmetry and , consequently , it yields the masses for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we end up with the exact electromagnetic symmetry .",
    "@xmath90    to do that , we start off from the higgs lagrangian below : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are real parameters , and @xmath96 are yukawa ( complex ) coupling parameters needed for the fermions to acquire non - zero masses . the covariant derivative of ( [ lhiggs ] ) acts on the @xmath87-higgs as follows : @xmath97 the @xmath87-field is a scalar singlet with the transformations under @xmath36 given below : @xmath98 using the previous gauge transformations , it can be readily checked that @xmath99 has the same transformation as ( [ transfxi ] ) .",
    "the yukawa interactions are gauge invariant under @xmath100 , once we impose that @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ; then , the lagrangian ( [ lhiggs ] ) is invariant under gauge symmetry ( [ transfxi ] ) .    the second higgs field , @xmath88 , couples to the gauge fields through the covariant derivatives which read as : @xmath103 where the @xmath104 is the generator of @xmath88-higgs corresponding to the @xmath53-subgroup .",
    "the @xmath88-field is a complex scalar doublet that has the gauge transformation under @xmath51 given by @xmath105 and under @xmath53 subgroup , it has the transformation @xmath106 the yukawa interactions of @xmath51 also guarantee the invariance under @xmath53 , whenever the generators satisfy the relations @xmath107 and @xmath108",
    ". then , the higgs potential that has been adopted in ( [ lhiggs ] ) is reproduced below : @xmath109 and all the lagrangian is invariant under the symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "the minimal value of the higgs potential is attained by the non - trivial vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field that keeps the full invariance of the model .",
    "it must be constant over space - time , @xmath110 , where @xmath14 is the non - trivial vev of the scalar field @xmath87 , defined by @xmath111 , with @xmath112 .",
    "we choose the parametrization of the @xmath87-complex field as @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are real functions .",
    "for the @xmath88 higgs , the minimal value of the potential is represented by the non - trivial vev that we call @xmath116 , where @xmath117 which breaks the electroweak symmetry of ( [ lhiggs ] ) .",
    "both scalar fields respect translational space - time symmetry .",

    "we observe the four peaks that represent the vacuum states of the scalars fields .     and",

    "the degenerated vacuum of the higgs fields are illustrated by the four down peaks . ]",
    "we shall initially analyze the sector @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath14-vev defines a scale for the breaking of the residual abelian symmetry , in which one of the abelian gauge fields acquires a mass term .",
    "the abelian sector is given by @xmath132 where , for convenience , we have chosen @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath134-sector suggests us to introduce the orthogonal @xmath135-transformation given in ( [ lgaugemassesxb ] ) to eliminate the mixing terms : @xmath136 where the constant couplings satisfy the relation @xmath137 .",
    "thus , if we redefine @xmath138 and @xmath139 , the lagrangian ( [ lgaugemassesxb ] ) can be brought to the form @xmath140 where the mass of @xmath27 is identified in terms of the @xmath14-vev as @xmath141 the mass term for @xmath27 reveals a massive neutral boson associated to scale of the @xmath14-vev .",
    "we identify the @xmath27-gauge boson as the new heavy particle beyond the observed spectrum of the sm , or , we can interpret it as a hidden photon candidate of the dark matter sector . the initial gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to an abelian symmetry which we shall refer to as @xmath86 , _",

    "thus , the @xmath12-mass with the correction due to the ratio @xmath285 is @xmath286 so that the uncertainty in ( [ massz0exp ] ) fixes the scale @xmath287 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath27 mass is around the value @xmath288 the presently - known experimental result for the @xmath124-higgs mass is by @xmath289 , so the @xmath116-vev scale fixes the coupling constant @xmath290 in the ew higgs sector . using ( [ mfh ] ) , the uncertainty in the higgs mass estimates the mixed coupling constant in order of @xmath291 .",
    "since we hope that the mass of the unknown higgs-@xmath114 must have the order of vev-@xmath14 , we adopt the range of @xmath292 to estimate a range for the mass of @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , the coupling constants of the original symmetry group have the values @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "thereby the mass of higgs-@xmath114 for this scale-@xmath14 , it is in the range @xmath295 and the coupling constant that mixes the fields @xmath124 and @xmath114 is estimated as @xmath296 .",
    "the leptonic sector determines each yukawa coupling constant @xmath297 , where we take the known masses @xmath298 , @xmath299 and @xmath300 , these coupling constants are given by @xmath301 and @xmath302 are coupling constants of yukawa interactions involving the @xmath45-fermion and leptons left or right components , we consider it to be the same order , that is , @xmath303 .",
    "thus if we use a mass of order @xmath304 for the @xmath45-fermion , we obtain @xmath305 , and the new yukawa constants coupling are estimated as @xmath306 with the mass obtained for the boson @xmath27 , for instance .",
    "a range for the mass of @xmath307 , according to atlas and cms experiments , is given by @xcite @xmath308 which means that the result in ( [ massofcu>>v ] ) is of the same order ( tev scale ) , but the x - boson has a mass above the expected @xmath307-mass .",
    "we rely on an abelian factor to get our @xmath27-boson , whereas @xmath307 is associated with an @xmath309 subgroup .",
    "we are actually saying that we expect another neutral gauge boson , which is not to be identified as @xmath307 .",
    "consequently , the new higgs that we have put in , with mass estimated in the range ( [ massh1u8gev ] ) can be heavier too .",
    "since we know that the vev associated with @xmath310 and @xmath307 masses is of order @xmath311 @xcite , the @xmath87-higgs must emerge near the @xmath312 .",
    "if we adopt now @xmath313 , the mass of @xmath114-higgs is estimated to be @xmath314",
    "in contrast with the previous section , with the new higgs and its associated ssb , we here analyze the case of a vev - scale such that @xmath315 .",
    "this corresponds to a ssb at a lower scale , @xmath14 , with respect to @xmath316 of the ew model . to this end ,",
    "we re - start from the original @xmath0-symmetry , but we first couple the higgs of ew model as done in ( [ lhiggs ] ) . after",
    "this ssb occurs , we obtain the remaining symmetry @xmath317 where the @xmath318-group is a result from the mixing of @xmath319 . the generator @xmath320 of @xmath318 is given by @xmath321 .",
    "thus , the free lagrangian for the neutral gauge fields , after this ssb takes place , reads as follows : @xmath322 now , to diagonalize the mixed @xmath323 term in ( [ lgaugeu1xu1 ] ) , we introduce the orthogonal transformation @xmath324 where @xmath171 satisfies the relation @xmath325 here .",
    "@xmath326 is the vector field associated to the @xmath318 subgroup . to reduce the residual @xmath36-symmetry to the electromagnetism @xmath17",
    ", we introduce the second higgs-@xmath87 sector coupled to the fields @xmath27 and @xmath52 , like in section iii .",
    "the @xmath87-(higgs ) field breaks now the symmetry @xmath327 where we have the vev scale-@xmath14 that defines a new massive gauge boson .",
    "this vev gives the neutral sector @xmath328 using the orthogonal transformation @xmath329 the mixing @xmath330 is eliminated in ( [ lgaugezgb ] ) , where we have used this second parametrization @xmath331 but the electric charge generator remains unchanged , that is , @xmath332 .",
    "consequently , all terms of neutral bosons are gathered together in the lagrangian @xmath333 where we have defined @xmath334    to simplify our task , we diagonalize the lagrangian to eliminate the mixed terms @xmath335 and @xmath336 . to achieve this goal ,",
    "we shift the photon-@xmath32 and @xmath12 boson as @xmath337 so the lagrangian is reduced to @xmath338 diagonalization of the mixing @xmath339 @xmath340 where @xmath341 is defined by @xmath342 the lagrangian involving @xmath343 and @xmath27 is so written into the matrix form @xmath344 where @xmath345 , @xmath56 is the matrix @xmath346 the mass matrix @xmath347 is not diagonal @xmath348 so to diagonalize the lagrangian ( [ lgaugematriz ] ) , we perform the orthogonal transformation @xmath349 , where @xmath350 . thus ,",
    "if we define the diagonal matrix as @xmath351 , the eigenvalues of @xmath352 are given by @xmath353 , so we obtain the diagonal matrix @xmath354 finally , the lagrangian in terms of @xmath355 takes over the form @xmath356 where @xmath357 .",
    "it can be readily checked that the solution for @xmath217 is the following @xmath135-matrix @xmath358 so , the matrix mass @xmath359 is given by @xmath360 now , we write the matrix @xmath352 as @xmath361 to adsorb it in the kinetic term redefining @xmath362 .",
    "the solution for the matrix @xmath363 is @xmath364 so that @xmath365 where the mass matrix is now @xmath366 , that is , @xmath367 since @xmath368 is also symmetric , it can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix , @xmath228 ; if we define @xmath369 , we end up with a fully diagonal lagrangian as given below : @xmath370 with @xmath371 is given by @xmath372 here , the @xmath12-mass acquires a correction coming from the mixing parameter , @xmath31 . for @xmath260 , we can write @xmath373 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ m_{x } & \\simeq & m_{x } \\ , \\left [ \\ , 1 - \\frac{4 \\ , u^{2}}{v^{2 } } \\ , \\sin^{4}\\theta_{w } \\left ( \\ , 1 -   \\frac{8 \\ , \\chi}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\ , \\right ) \\ , \\right ] \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath228-matrix also corresponds to an @xmath135-transformation , but with rotation angle of @xmath374 ; so , we have @xmath375 to avoid confusion in notation , the doublet represented by @xmath376 is renamed as the original fields @xmath377 , @xmath27 , and the photon is also renamed as @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the full diagonal lagrangian is more explicitly written as @xmath378 the uncertainty on ( [ massz0exp ] ) can be taken to fix the vev - scale as @xmath379 , and therefore , the mass of the @xmath27-boson becomes @xmath380 whenever @xmath315 , the eigenvalues of ( [ autovaloresmhf ] ) are given by @xmath381 and mass of the corresponding @xmath114-higgs is comes out in the range @xmath382 . under these conditions , if we take @xmath383 , the mass of new fermion turns out to be around @xmath384 .",
    "another possibility , which seems more appealing , is to fix the scale @xmath14 by adopting the value @xmath23 . in so doing ,",
    "we obtain the vev @xmath385 , so that the mass of the @xmath114-higgs is estimated in the range @xmath386 in this range , the hidden @xmath45-fermion has a mass around @xmath387 .",
    "the interactions in the scenario @xmath315 are obtained by replacing the transformations ( [ transfabzg ] ) and ( [ transfcgxa ] ) into the expression ( [ lintay ] ) , and using the parametrization ( [ eggg ] ) ; this yields : @xmath388 where here we have defined the generators @xmath389 and @xmath262 as follows @xmath390 we observe a resulting millicharge given by @xmath391 .",
    "furthermore , we also obtain the correction induced by the @xmath392-parameter to each interaction .",
    "we have made efforts to set up a model with a extra @xmath39-factor that may describe a scenario of a particle physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the model is based on the gauge group @xmath393 , where the extra @xmath39-factor introduces a(new ) massive neutral boson .",
    "the mass of the latter is generated upon a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism that defines an extra vev scale , beyond that vev of @xmath3 associated to the higgs field of the standard model . in our proposal ,",
    "the higgs sector displays two scalars fields and the gauge symmetry allows interactions between them .",
    "this mechanism can be introduced in two ways : in the first case , the ssb occurs through a vev scale-@xmath14 , where @xmath394 , and as consequence , we obtain a heavy neutral boson with a mass around the @xmath395 .",
    "next , the higgs of vev @xmath3 breaks the electroweak symmetry to give the masses for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the sequence of ssb mechanisms is as follows : @xmath200 the result for the mass of @xmath20 is in agreement with the mass values for the boson @xmath307 estimated by the atlas and cms experiment .",
    "the scale @xmath396 estimates the mass of new higgs within the range @xmath397 , that is agreement with the diphoton resonance at @xmath398 .",
    "furthermore , the subgroup @xmath39 also introduces a new fermion in the tev scale that would be a candidate to the dark matter . in the second scenario ,",
    "the ssb mechanism is introduced to break the composite subgroup @xmath319 in the vev scale of @xmath3 to give mass for @xmath12 , and so , a further sbb defines the vev scale-@xmath14 , such that @xmath399 .",
    "if this is the situation , the x - boson acquires a lower mass , that may describe a phenomenology of elementary particle physics at the lower energy scale .",
    "the scheme for the ssbs follows now the pattern below : @xmath400 this proposal may be discussed in connection with the para - photon or hidden photon phenomenology , at @xmath401 scale , which can be related to the composition of dark matter .",
    "other context is in the recent proposal of a new boson needed to explain the excited @xmath402-beryllium decay . in this case",
    ", the mass of boson @xmath20 is fixed at the scale @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the results of ssb lead us to the vev scale of @xmath385 that must be origin of a new higgs within the range mass @xmath403",
    ". the decay of new higgs and the influence on the @xmath20-boson can be the motivation to a forthcoming paper",
    ". a unification scheme including @xmath310- and @xmath307- bosons in the framework of an @xmath404-gauge group may also be the subject of further investigation to be pursued ."
