    "there is no doubt that caf@xmath0 is the key component for establishing 157 nm uv lithography .",
    "its perfect cubic symmetry together with a great homogeneity of large single crystals which are very stable under normal conditions makes it a perfect material for homogeneous optical lens design .",
    "however , there is a severe shortcoming of the material on which the attention was focused within the last year .",
    "this is the so called `` intrinsic birefringence''.@xcite for the first glance it is astonishing .",
    "looking at standard textbooks ( e.g @xcite ) we note that a cubic crystal does not show any birefringence . on the other hand experiments observe a spatial dependence of the dielectric properties .",
    "light propagating along different directions through the crystal shows a deviation between different polarization directions which is of the order of 10@xmath3 nm / cm for uv light with 157 nm .",
    "or with other words the dielectric function depends on the direction in which the light propagates through the crystal and shows a difference which is of the order of 10@xmath3 .",
    "how can this obvious misfit between standard textbooks and recent observations in caf@xmath0 be resolved ?",
    "the answer leads back to a physical phenomenon which is known as spatial dispersion.@xcite    the statement `` a cubic system does never show birefringence '' can be proven exactly , since in a cubic system the ellipsoid corresponding to the dielectric function is always a sphere .",
    "the question remains : what is a `` system '' ?",
    "the crystal of caf@xmath0 has exactly cubic symmetry but the `` system '' of light interacting with this perfectly cubic crystal shows a deviation from cubic symmetry .",
    "this is due to the fact that the light carries a @xmath4 vector pointing in the vacuum in the direction of propagation .",
    "this is a consideration which has been already made more than one century ago @xcite .",
    "however the speed of light is much larger than any speed in a solid state system and therefore one can usually safely neglect the wave - vector dependence of the propagating light .",
    "this statement is identical to the wavelength of light being in the optical window much larger than any length scale in a solid .",
    "there are however two important exceptions where the assumption made above ceases to be valid .",
    "the first ( i ) is when one is by far leaving the optical window .",
    "this is the case at x - ray scattering experiments . here",
    "the wavelength of light is of the order of the lattice constant and this causes a wave - vector ( spatial ) dependence of the resulting scattering signal .",
    "the second case ( ii ) which is valid for caf@xmath0 and many other solids is the case of light in the vicinity of a dispersive absorption occurring also at small wavevectors ( large length scales ) .",
    "since the dielectric function is an analytic function it has to follow causality which is expressed in the kramers - kronig relation between its real and imaginary part .",
    "the vicinity of a band edge can cause spatial dispersion in a semiconductor system ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in a semiconductor ,",
    "the absorption is mainly dominated by the band edge and an exciton , the two particle bound state of the electron ",
    "hole pair only plays a minor role .",
    "the situation changes if we look at ionic crystals like caf@xmath0 . here",
    "screening of the bare coulomb interaction is less effective which expresses itself in deep excitonic bound states .",
    "this is expressed in the exciton intensity being inverse proportional to the third power of the static dielectric function @xmath5.@xcite the connection between a dispersive excitonic bound state and spatial dispersion has been already discussed for ki .",
    "@xcite    when discussing possible alternative material designs to caf@xmath0 it is important to understand the microscopic mechanism beyond the spatial dispersion in great detail and it is in particular important to know and predict the exciton dispersion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ section1 ] we define the system in the case when the approximation of locality breaks down .",
    "in section [ section2 ] we review the connection between the electronic part of the dielectric function and the bare two - particle propagator .",
    "we look at the free two particle propagator in the absence of any screened coulomb attraction and its connection to the band structure .",
    "the connection between the band structure , which can e.g. be based on dft ( density functional theory ) calculations , and the dynamic polarization is investigated in section [ section3 ] . in the following ( section [ section4 ] )",
    "we discuss analyticity based on the resulting pole structure of the dielectric function .",
    "this describes to a large part the situation in a semiconductor where no deep bound state is present .",
    "section ( [ section5 ] ) serves to introduce the two body problem of the electron hole pair which leads to the excitonic bound state when a reasonable assumption for the weakly screened coulomb attraction has been made .",
    "based on the model assumptions made , we discuss the spatial dispersion of caf@xmath0 close to the bound state level in section [ section6 ] and compare our predictions with the experimental work of.@xcite",
    "light has a @xmath4 vector pointing along its propagation direction .",
    "this wave - vector becomes important when the light is interacting with a long wavelength ( @xmath6 ) excitation of the system . in an isotropic medium",
    "this wave vector dependence will only depend on the absolute value of @xmath4 . in liquids and glasses",
    "this leads e.g. to the observation of hydrodynamic modes ( phonon modes ) in light scattering experiments.@xcite in single crystals the situation is different as not only the dependence on the absolute value of the wavevector of the light is important but also the direction of the wave vector with respect to the crystal orientations .",
    "the crystal of caf@xmath0 possesses ideal cubic symmetry .",
    "that means in the static limit that also all response functions have to show this symmetry .",
    "dynamically there are situations especially close to a strong excitation at long wavelengths , when the breaking of cubic symmetry due to the incident light gets important .",
    "therefore not only the dynamic of a dielectric response has to be considered but also the wave - vector dependence . the electric field @xmath7 is connected with the electric induction @xmath8 in a non - local way .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dynamic dielectric function . for the physics of the spatial dispersion in caf@xmath0 we will focus on the part of the dynamic dielectric function which is caused by electronic excitations . in general",
    "the dielectric function is an analytic function defined on the complex @xmath11-plane . along the real axis",
    "it has an real and imaginary part .",
    "@xmath12 only in the static limit @xmath13 one can assign a physical value to the real and imaginary part separately .",
    "the real part is connected with polarizabilities and the imaginary part with mobile charges ( @xmath14 ) which are absent in an insulator . for a general crystal",
    "the dielectric function is a tensor . since we want to keep the equations as transparent as possible we do not write tensor indices .",
    "we assume a coordinate system placed along the main axes of the cubic crystal . for a cubic crystal like caf@xmath0 we can concentrate on specific directions of the @xmath4 vector .",
    "symmetry considerations allow to decompose all tensorial quantities into its symmetry components .",
    "this will provide rules to fill all the components of the tensorial dielectric function .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     in view of the measurements performed by burnett et al .",
    "@xcite we need the refractive index along different directions . in an isotropic medium",
    "this is where the dielectric function is diagonal with three identical diagonal elements this would be simply given by : @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the ( real part of the ) diagonal part of the diagonalized dielectric function .",
    "the concept of a refractive index becomes by far more sophisticated as soon as the medium shows anisotropies .",
    "this is also the case for caf@xmath0 .",
    "here one has to go into a new coordinate system whose z - direction is determined by the @xmath4-direction of the incident light .",
    "two possible directions perpendicular to the z - direction complete this new coordinate system and are denoted with greek letters @xmath17 . within the @xmath18-@xmath19-plane lies the polarization vector @xmath20 pointing in the direction of the electric induction @xmath8 of the light . within this new coordinate system the calculation of the refractive index",
    "is given by the zero of a two dimensional determinant.@xcite @xmath21 in general the eigenvalue problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq : n0 ] ) has two solutions which correspond to the main polarization axes .",
    "there is a further difference to an anisotropic medium .",
    "this is the fact that the wave - vector @xmath4 is not in general parallel to the poynting - vector @xmath22 which points along the direction of the group velocity which is the analogon of the path in classical geometrical optic .",
    "this is expected to be small in a cubic crystal .",
    "so the refractive index is dependent on @xmath4 and can for a given experimental setup be dependent on the polarization direction of the incident light .",
    "@xmath23 in a cubic crystal like caf@xmath0 there are several exceptions for the wave - vector @xmath4 and the poynting vector pointing along the same direction where no dependence on the polarization direction occurs as one can derive from symmetry considerations .",
    "one is for example light propagating along the main axis of the crystal ( e.g. @xmath24 now measured in the coordinate system of the crystal axes ) .",
    "the dielectric function diverges close to the excitonic bound state depending on the wave - vector @xmath4 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : el ] ) with @xmath25 is the wavelength of the exciton for the given @xmath4 vector .",
    "this wavelength must be for caf@xmath0 close to the 112 nm where the exciton is found experimentally @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : el ] ) is quite different to what would result from just a formal taylor expansion of the dielectric function . in this case",
    "the dielectric function should show a @xmath26 behaviour .",
    "we want to look at the quantity measured in @xcite . there",
    "the difference of the refractive index @xmath27 with a wave - vector pointing in the @xmath28 direction and the polarization vector @xmath20 pointing in two different directions ( in @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) is measured .",
    "( [ eq : nsimp ] ) gives @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we have plotted the wavelength dependence of @xmath27 as it would result from the experimentally observed bound state level lying at 112nm.@xcite    it can be seen that describing the experimental observations with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn ] ) ( dotted line ) gives a better agreement with the experimental observation ( crosses ) than just a @xmath26 behaviour ( dashed line ) as it would be expected from a taylor expansion of the dielectric function .",
    "we therefore claim in this work that the anisotropy which is seen in caf@xmath0 at low wavelengths is caused by the exciton dispersion of an excitonic level around 112 nm ( 11.2ev ) . especially measurements in the wavelength range between 112 nm and 157 nm we predict to show a clear @xmath32 behaviour .",
    "we argue that the optical anisotropy observed in caf@xmath0 is caused by exciton dispersion .",
    "the delocalized exciton lies at approximately 112 nm . using this excitonic model",
    "the measured data on the optical anisotropy can be well explained and it is predicted that the dielectric function should diverge for lower wavelengths as @xmath32 . here @xmath25 is the wavelength of the excitonic bound state .",
    "if the connection to the exciton is indeed the dominant mechanism beyond the optical anisotropy all possible compensation approaches have to be reviewed . e.g. forming solid solution crystals , if possible at all , would only lead to an improvement , if the exciton dispersion will be smaller in such a crystal .",
    "further the subtle difference between the spatial dispersion and birefringence has to be taken into account in a very careful way when performing lens design .",
    "thanks d.strauch and k.schmalzl for helpful discussions and for band structure data on caf@xmath0 .",
