    "the ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice have aroused growing interests in recent years . by regulating the various parameters of the standing wave laser fields that create the optical potentials , such as the laser power and wave length ,",
    "many theoretical models in the condensed matter physics can be realized experimentally , especially those for the strongly correlated many body systems.@xcite in particular , bosons in a lattice have been widely studied in theory and experiment .",
    "the investigation of the correlated bosons can be traced back to the study of @xmath3he.@xcite recently d. jaksch has pointed out that the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) eq.([eq:1 ] ) can well describe the ultracold boson atoms in an optical lattice , if one assumes a short - range pseudo potential interaction between the atoms and that the wannier functions are well localized on the lattice site.@xcite    the bhm has been studied using various analytical and numerical methods . in their seminal paper ,",
    "m. p. a. fisher _ et al .",
    "_ used field theoretical approach to investigate the ground state of this model and obtained the superfluid ( sf)-mott insulator ( mi ) transition on the mean field level.@xcite the mott insulator is an incompressible state where integer number of bosons are localized on each site , while the superfluid phase is compressible and has nonlocal boson wave functions . as an interesting phase ,",
    "the ground state of mi is considered as a good candidate to realize the qubits for quantum information processing.@xcite for weakly interacting bosons for which the fluctuations around the mean - field state are small , the bogolubov theory or the gross - pitaevskii equation applies but both fail to predict the sf - mi transition.@xcite beyond the mean field level , methods that can tackle the strong correlations have been applied @xcite , including the gutzwiller approach@xcite , bethe ansatz@xcite , time - dependent variational principle method@xcite , slave boson approach@xcite , the strong coupling expansion@xcite , variational method based on mean field theory@xcite , and the effective action approach@xcite , _",
    "etc_. recently the cavity method based on the bethe lattice is also applied to bhm@xcite .",
    "the numerical tools such as quantum monte carlo@xcite and density matrix renormalization group@xcite are used frequently for the unbiased studies .",
    "the physics of the bhm depends critically on its spatial dimension . for a one dimensional system ,",
    "the mermin - wagner theorem@xcite excludes the possibility of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) at finite temperatures . in the strong interaction regime ,",
    "the bosons behave as the tonks - girardeau gas whose properties are similar to the noninteracting fermions.@xcite the bec in two dimensions can be viewed as a quasi - condensate , and the mott transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless type.@xcite the mi is strictly defined at zero temperature and the mi - bec transition is a quantum transition well defined at zero temperature .",
    "however , there is a finite temperature range where the occupation is fixed at an integer . as temperature increases ,",
    "the system changes from this mott - like regime into the normal phase through a smooth crossover . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the sf phase also transits into the normal phase at a finite critical temperature.@xcite    experimentally , the bhm has been realized in the system of alkali metal atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "the sf to mi transition has been observed in @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , by changing the depth of the optical lattices.@xcite these studies focused on the mi and the sf phase mainly in @xmath6 and @xmath7@xcite at finite temperatures .",
    "the temperature in these studies is a key factor and its effects on the observation can not be ignored .",
    "recent studies show that due to the finite temperature effects , the sharp peaks in the momentum distribution commonly adopted to identify the sf can not be used as a reliable signature.@xcite due to technical difficulties , accurate studies for high dimensional system ( @xmath4 ) at finite temperatures that match the experiments are still highly desirable .    here , we are interested in the strongly correlated bosons on a high dimensional lattice ( @xmath4 ) at finite temperatures , which received less attention in previous theoretical studies . one suitable method for our purpose is the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "dmft is an exact theory in infinite spatial dimensions.@xcite as an approximation for finite dimensional systems , it has been widely used in the study of strongly correlated fermion systems and received much success.@xcite in a recent work , k. byczuk and d. vollhardt extended the idea of dmft to correlated boson systems and applied it to the bosonic falicov - kimball model.@xcite in their theory , instead of the usual way of scaling the hopping amplitude in the fermionic dmft , they used a different scaling ansatz for bosons : scaling @xmath8 for terms containing the anomalous averages @xmath9 or @xmath10 , and scaling @xmath11 for others .",
    "such a new scaling is used to guarantee that the energy density is finite as the spatial dimension goes to infinity , even if anomalous averages are involved in the boson systems .",
    "it should be noted that the derivation of the above b - dmft equations is not unique .",
    "recently , the essentially identical equations are also obtained by using an uniform scaling of @xmath12 and keeping up to the subleading order in the @xmath13 expansion.@xcite in this paper , we apply b - dmft to the bhm .",
    "the resulting effective bosonic impurity model is solved by exact diagonalization ( ed ) method@xcite .",
    "results are presented for various phases at finite temperatures and compared to other theories and the experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the single band bose hubbard model .",
    "we present the b - dmft equations for the bhm , detail the impurity solver that we use , and give tests and benchmarks . in sec .",

    "feshbach resonances can be used to change the interaction strength over a wide range , even from repulsive to attractive.@xcite in this paper we study the repulsive bhm with @xmath22 .",
    "we add the chemical potential @xmath23 which controls the number of bosons in the grand canonical ensemble . for simplicity , we take the density of states of the bethe lattice , which is semicircular in the limit of infinite coordinations , @xmath24      in dmft , a lattice model is mapped into a single impurity problem with the self - consistently determined bath spectra .",
    "it becomes exact when the spatial dimension is infinite and hence ignores the spatial fluctuations from the outset .",
    "however , it fully takes into account the temporal fluctuations ( imaginary time).@xcite the key ingredient to extend the dmft to bosons is a proper scaling of the hopping amplitude of bosons in the limit of infinite dimensions.@xcite    we adopt the ansatz of scaling in ref .   and implement similar derivations for the bhm .",
    "the detail of derivations can be found in ref .  .",

    "this is consistent with the naive picture that strong local repulsion between bosons tends to suppress the particle number fluctuations and act against the bec . also , the quasiparticle states into which the bosons can condense are turned into incoherent states and shifted into the hubbard bands by a large @xmath21 . therefore , our conclusion is that , different from the bosonic falicov - kimball model , the local repulsion in the bhm reduces the transition temperature of bec .",
    "different phases in the system can be distinguished from @xmath125 and @xmath149 .",
    "at zero temperature , the system has two phases : the bec phase and the mi . due to the competition between the on - site repulsion @xmath21 and the hopping @xmath181",
    ", there is a quantum phase transition between them . as temperature increases , the bec phase and",
    "the mi will change into normal phase through a phase transition and a crossover , respectively .",

    ", however , gives @xmath198 for @xmath192 , being consistent with the more accurate values .    for realistic lattices with a finite coordinate @xmath197 ,",
    "the b - dmft is still applicable but should be regarded as an approximation to finite dimensional systems .",

    "the b - dmft calculation for the bhm in 3d cubic lattice and quantitative comparison with the experiments as well as with the previous theoretical results will be an interesting topic . but this is only attainable when an accurate impurity solver is available",

    "finally we note that the ed method used in this work poses limitations to our study . due to",
