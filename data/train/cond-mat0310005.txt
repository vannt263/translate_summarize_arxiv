    "spintronics , the science and technology of manipulating the spin of the electron for building integrated information processing and storage devices , showed great promise @xcite .",
    "spintronics devices also promises to access the intrinsic quantum regime of transport , paving the path towards quantum computing .",
    "however , many challenges remain in this exciting quest . among them ,",
    "purely electric and dissipationless manipulation of the electron spin and its quantum transport is one of the most important goals of quantum spintronics .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we discovered a basic law of spintronics , which relates the spin current and the electric field by the response equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the current of the @xmath3-th component of the spin along the direction @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the totally antisymmetric tensor in three dimensions .",
    "sinova et al .",
    "@xcite found a similar effect in the two - dimensional n - type semiconductors with rashba coupling .",
    "this law is similar to ohm s law in electronics , and the spin conductivity @xmath6 has the dimension of the electric charge @xmath7 divided by the scale of length .",
    "however , unlike the ohm s law , this fundamental response equation describes a purely topological and dissipationless spin current .",
    "it is important to note here that the spin current is even under the time - reversal operation @xmath8 . when the direction of the arrow of time is reversed , both the direction of the current and the spin are reversed and the spin current remains unchanged . since both the spin current and the electric field in eq .",
    "( [ spin_response ] ) are even under time reversal @xmath8 , the transport coefficient @xmath6 is called `` reactive '' and can be purely non - dissipative .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the ohm s law @xmath9 relating the charge current @xmath10 to the electric field . in this case , the charge current @xmath10 changes sign under time - reversal @xmath8 , while the electric field is even under @xmath8 .",
    "since the ohm s law relates quantities of different symmetries under time reversal @xmath8 , the charge conductivity @xmath11 breaks the time - reveral symmetry and describes the inevitable joule heating and dissipation .",
    "quantum hall current , which is transverse to the electric field and dissipationless , has the feature similar to eq .",
    "( [ spin_response ] ) , but the time - reversal symmetry is compensated by the external magnetic field .",
    "dissipationless current without time - reversal symmetry breaking is extremely important and fundamental in solid - state physics , the most celebrated example of which is the superconducting current .",
    "it is described by the london equation , @xmath12 where the current @xmath10 is related to the vector potential @xmath13 instead of the electric field . in the london equation ,",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath13 are odd under time reversal @xmath8 , therefore , the transport coefficient @xmath14 , also called the superfluid density , describes the reversible and dissipationless flow of the supercurrent .    in summary , the dissipationless spin current discovered in ref .",
    "shares some basic features with the superconducting current and the quantum hall edge current , in the sense that , 1 ) the spin hall conductivity @xmath6 is a dissipationless or reactive transport coefficient , even under the time - reversal operation @xmath8 ; 2 ) the spin hall conductivity @xmath6 can be expressed as an integral over all states below the fermi energy , not only over states in the vicinity of the fermi energy as in most dissipative transport coefficients .",
    "furthermore , just like the case of the quantum hall effect@xcite , the contribution of each state to the spin hall conductivity @xmath6 can be expressed entirely in terms of the curvature of a gauge field in momentum space , which in our case is non - abelian .",
    "the dissipationless spin current is induced by the electric field through the spin - orbit coupling , whose characteristic energy scale exceeds the room temperature in many semiconducting materials",
    ".    electronic structure of semiconductors with diamond structure ( e.g.  si , ge ) and zincblende structure ( e.g.  gaas , insb ) are well understood in terms of the @xmath15 perturbation theory .",
    "the top of the valence bands are at @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17-point .",
    "they consist of the three p - orbitals @xmath18 with spin up and down . in the presence of the relativistic spin - orbit coupling , these 6 states",
    "are split into four - fold degenerate @xmath19 states and two - fold degenerate @xmath20 state . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes the total angular momentum of the atomic orbital , obtained through the coupling of the orbital angular momentum @xmath22 and the spin angular momentum @xmath23 . the second order perturbation in the @xmath15 results in the effective hamiltonian near @xmath24 , which is called luttinger hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the explicit form of the matrices @xmath29 @xmath30 is given in appendix [ appendix - matrix ] .",
    "for simplicity , we have put @xmath31 in the original luttinger hamiltonian ; most of subsequent discussions are also applicable to more general cases with @xmath32 .    .",
    "cb means the conduction band , hh the heavy - hole band , lh the light - hole band , and so the split - off band , respectively .",
    "when the small inversion symmetry breaking is neglected , all of them are doubly degenerate .",
    "the fermi energy shown in the figure corresponds to the hole density @xmath33 .",
    "the splitting @xmath34ev at @xmath35 between the lh , hh and so bands are due to the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the hh and lh bands are degenerate at @xmath35 , giving rise to a monopole in the gauge field as discussed in section [ kubo_calculation ] ]    on the other hand , the conduction bands are made out of the s - orbital and hence doubly degenerate .",
    "when we neglect a small effect due to broken inversion symmetry , this degeneracy is not lifted due to the kramers theorem .",
    "therefore the effect of the spin - orbit interaction is small in the conduction band , although the rashba effect @xcite is induced by the electric field near e.g. the interface structure .",
    "the spin hall current in the rashba system has recently been discussed by sinova et al .",
    "these authors showed that dissipationless and intrinsic spin hall current can take an universal value in this system .",
    "the position of the conduction band minima depends on the material .",
    "for example , they are located at general points along the axis between the @xmath17- and the @xmath36-points in si , while they at at the @xmath22-points in ge .",
    "we will focus on the valence bands below because of the intrinsically strong spin - orbit interaction .",
    "although the band structure of semiconductors with spin - orbit coupling has been understood for many years , only recently has it been recognized that the gauge field and its curvature in the momentum space made out of the bloch wavefunction play important roles in the transport properties of electrons in solids .",
    "the gauge field is defined in terms of the bloch state @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a band index .",
    "it represents the inner product of the two bloch wavefunctions infinitesimally separated in @xmath40-space .",
    "this gauge field @xmath41 describes topological structure of bloch wavefunctions in the momentum space @xcite , and plays an important role in transport properties @xcite and in magnetic superconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular , this gauge field is related to the transverse conductivity @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath45-component of the field strength made from @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the fermi distribution of fr the @xmath39-th band with energy @xmath48 .",
    "this formula @xcite is the foundation of the integer quantum hall effect ( qhe ) , and further applied to the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) in ferromagnetic metals @xcite . especially in the magnetic semiconductors ( ga , mn)as @xcite , the calculation @xcite by the formula eq .  ( [ london ] )",
    "well explains the experimental results quantitatively , giving some credit that the ahe is mostly of intrinsic origin rather than extrinsic origins , e.g. , skew scattering and/or side - jump mechanism .",
    "however in the presence of the time - reversal symmetry , the d.c .",
    "transverse conductivity @xmath42 vanishes , and the topological structure of the bloch wavefunctions has not been systematically studied in the context of transport theory . as we will show below ,",
    "an even more beautiful and nontrivial quantum topological structure is hidden in the valence - band structure in the paramagnetic state , which is analogous to the fermionic quasi - particles in the so(5 ) theory@xcite .",
    "this is also motivated by the recent work by one of the present authors on the generalization of the quantum hall effect into four dimensions in terms of the so(5 ) symmetry@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall show that the so(5 ) group structure of the @xmath19 bloch states provides a natural description of the non - abelian @xmath0 holonomy and its curvature in momentum space .",
    "this gauge structure underlies the dissipationless , topological spin current in hole - doped semiconductors .    in the presence of the spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "the conventionally defined total spin operator is not conserved , and it is nontrivial to define the spin current in this case .",
    "our formalism resolves this issue by discovering conserved quantities in the luttinger hamiltonian ( [ luttinger ] ) and by defining associated conserved spin currents .",
    "these quantities have clear physical and geometric meanings .",
    "the exact quantum calculation of the conserved spin hall conductivity @xmath6 is performed in terms of the kubo formula , and the results can be expressed entirely in terms of the non - abelian gauge curvature in momentum space .",
    "our fully quantum mechanical results identify the quantum correction to the previous semiclassical result@xcite in terms of the wave - packet formalism .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ definition ]",
    ", we reformulate the luttinger hamiltonian in terms of the so(5 ) algebra and give the definition of the conserved spin current .",
    "based on this definition , the calculation of the spin hall conductivity in terms of kubo formula is presented in section [ kubo_calculation ] , where the geometrical meaning is stressed , and the comparison with the previous semiclassical result is given .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions . throughout the paper",
    ", we take the unit @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the luttinger hamiltonian ( [ luttinger ] ) has two eigenvalues : @xmath51 corresponding to the light - hole ( lh ) and the heavy - hole ( hh ) bands .",
    "each eigenvalues are doubly degenerate , due to the kramers theorem based on the time - reversal symmetry . for",
    "a fixed value of @xmath40 , let @xmath52 denote a projection onto the two - dimensional subspace of states of the lh band .",
    "we also define @xmath53 similarly .",
    "these operators are written as @xmath54 they obviously satisfy @xmath55 in terms of these projectors , the luttinger hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath56 from this projector form of the hamiltonian , we see that the lh and the hh bands are each two - fold degenerate , and there is an su(2 ) rotation symmetry acting on each band . combining the lh and the hh bands , there is an so(4)@xmath57su(2)@xmath58su(2 ) symmetry at every @xmath40 point . in this section",
    ", we shall develop the mathematical framework in which this so(4 ) symmetry is made manifest , and this symmetry is used to define the conserved spin current . since @xmath59 and @xmath60 depend on @xmath40 , the quantization axis for each su(2 ) varies as a function of @xmath40 . when @xmath40 is adiabatically changed along a closed circuit , the fermionic wave function in general does not return to itself ; in fact , the final wave function is related to the starting wave function by an su(2 ) transformation within each band .",
    "therefore , this problem is a natural generalization of berry s u(1 ) phase@xcite to the case of su(2 ) holonomy@xcite .",
    "in particular , demler and zhang@xcite developed a formalism of the su(2 ) non - abelian holonomy in terms of the so(5 ) clifford algebra , which we shall adopt throughout this paper .",
    "upon expanding the @xmath61 term in the hamiltonian ( [ luttinger ] ) , we obtain a product of two quadratic forms , one of the form @xmath62 and another of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "a 3@xmath583 symmetric matrix can be further decomposed into one trace and five traceless parts .",
    "the trace part has the same form as the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ luttinger ] ) , and cancels the @xmath65 contribution by construction .",
    "the remaining five traceless symmetric ( @xmath66 ) combination of @xmath63 can be identified with the clifford algebra of the dirac @xmath17 matrices , with the identification @xmath67 the explicit forms of @xmath68 and @xmath64 are given in appendix [ appendix - matrix ] . in terms of the @xmath17 matrices ,",
    "the luttinger hamiltonian ( [ luttinger ] ) takes the elegant form @xmath69 where @xmath70 we recognize that the vector components of @xmath71 are nothing but the five d - wave combinations in the @xmath40 space .",
    "the five - dimensional vector @xmath72 provides a mapping from the three - dimensional @xmath40 space to the five - dimensional @xmath72 space ( fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "since the luttinger hamiltonian depends on @xmath40 only through @xmath73 , we can perform all calculations in the 5d @xmath72 space , and finally project back onto the 3d @xmath40 space .",
    "this formalism enables a unified treatment for the anisotropic luttinger hamiltonian , and more importantly , reveals the deep connection to the four - dimensional quantum hall effect ( 4dqhe ) @xcite . here and",
    "henceforth we adopt the convention that indices appearing twice are summed over .",
    "vector space to the five - dimensional @xmath72 vector space .",
    "the gauge structures of the spin current are associated with the magnetic monopoles located at the origins of the @xmath40 and @xmath72 spaces . ]",
    "the eigenvalues of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "they are of course the same as ( [ e - values ] ) . in terms of the @xmath17 matrices , the projection operators ( [ k - projector ] ) can be expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath17 matrices are convenient for subsequent calculations , since a product of any number of @xmath17 matrices can be easily reduced to a linear combination of @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "the five @xmath82 matrices contain the most general quadratic terms of the spin operator @xmath29 , while the ten @xmath83 matrices contain both the three spin operators @xmath29 and the seven cubic , symmetric and traceless combinations of spin operators of the form @xmath84 , as discussed in appendix [ appendix - matrix ] .",
    "these ten spin operators are generated under the heisenberg time evolutions of the single spin operators , and it is natural to group them all into a unified object . for @xmath85 , @xmath83 commutes with the hamiltonian and generates an so(5 ) symmetry group of the hamiltonian .",
    "( in fact , the hamiltonian has a higher , su(4 ) symmetry in this case ) . for a given @xmath40 , a fixed @xmath72 vector singles out a particular direction in the five - dimensional @xmath72 vector space , and the second term in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) breaks the so(5 ) symmetry to an so(4 ) symmetry .",
    "this is nothing but so(4)@xmath57 su(2)@xmath58su(2 ) symmetry which we discussed earlier . in this way",
    ", we see that the so(5 ) formalism gives an elegant geometric interpretation of the su(2)@xmath58su(2 ) symmetry of the lh and the hh bands .",
    "it is in fact a subgroup of so(5 ) rotation which keeps a fixed @xmath72 vector invariant . as we shall see later in the paper , and in appendix [ appendix - gauge ] , the 3d monopole structure in @xmath40 space can be best understood in terms of the monopole structure in the 5d @xmath72 space .    to find the conserved quantities ,",
    "let us define the conserved spin density explicitly as @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "for the conservation of the spin , we require that @xmath88 $ ] is proportional to @xmath89 for small @xmath90 .",
    "this is realized by imposing a condition on @xmath91 as @xmath92 or equivalently , @xmath93 from these relations it follows that @xmath94 there are five such linear equations , but only four of them are linearly independent because of the antisymmetry of @xmath95 .",
    "originally , @xmath95 has 10 degrees of freedom , subtracting 4 constraints gives the remaining 6 degrees of freedom , exactly the same as the number of generators in so(4 ) algebra .",
    "therefore , the projection operator @xmath91 projects the full so(5 ) symmetry generators into the so(4 ) subspace which is orthogonal to a given direction of @xmath72 .    in the limit @xmath96 , ( [ xiabcd - condition ] )",

    "the conserved spin takes the form @xmath107 the subscript @xmath108 denotes the fact that this spin current is conserved . here",
    ", we inserted a factor of @xmath109 , because in the lh and hh bands ( i.e. @xmath19 subspace ) , the expectation value of the spin angular momentum is one - third of that of the total angular momentum @xmath110 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ sk - c ] ) corresponds to neglecting interband matrix elements of the spin angular momentum . in a matrix form ,",
    "the corresponding conserved spin current is @xmath111",
    "in order to calculate the spin current response based on kubo formula , we should first define the `` spin current operator '' .",
    "the conventional definition of the spin current , with spin along the @xmath112 axis flowing along the @xmath3 axis , is given by @xmath113 because the spin @xmath114 is not conserved , @xmath115 does not satisfy the equation of continuity without any source term . before presenting the full calculation based on the conserved spin current discussed in the previous section ,",
    "we first calculate the linear response of this non - conserved spin current to the applied electric field and then comment on its difficulties .",
    "the kubo formula gives @xmath116 where @xmath117 ( @xmath118 : integer ) , @xmath119 ( @xmath39 : integer ) , @xmath120 , @xmath121 in ( [ qijkinul ] ) represents the time - ordering , @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the matsubara green s function , given in ( [ green ] ) .    in the clean case",
    ", the summation over @xmath124 can be calculated by a contour integral . in the trace operation in the above equation , only the terms of products of four or five @xmath17 matrices are nonzero , and",
    "the result is @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are one - particle energies for the two bands , measured form the chemical potential @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , in the static limit the linear response is given by @xmath129 this result @xmath130 in eq .",
    "( [ kubo - nonconserved ] ) does not vanish in the limit of @xmath131 , i.e. , the absence of the spin - orbit coupling .",

    "( [ qijk ] ) , and eq .  ( [ kubo - nonconserved ] ) is the one which is valid in the d.c .",
    "limit , when @xmath134 .",
    "we have learned that hu , bernevig and wu have also obtained a similar result independently @xcite .",
    "we note that this result ( [ kubo - nonconserved ] ) is reproduced by wave - packet dynamics in ref .  .",
    "the conventional definition of the spin current ( [ conventional ] ) is physically admissible , as is usually adopted .",
    "however , its mathematical meaning as a `` current '' is ill - defined .",
    "a `` current '' is always associated with a corresponding conserved quantity .",
    "a `` current '' is then defined by using the noether s theorem , or equivalently , by the equation of continuity .",
    "since the conventionally defined spin current is not conserved for the luttinger hamiltonian due to the spin - orbit coupling , we shall use the the conserved spin current constructed in the previous chapter .",
    "there are also physical reasons to take this conserved spin current . generally speaking",
    ", there must be some reason for a quantity to have slow dynamics and to contribute to the low frequency response .",
    "one is a conservation law and the other is a critical slowing down . in the present context , the latter is irrelevant and we need to look for a conserved current as we have done in the preceding chapter .",
    "when we separate the spin into the conserved and the nonconserved parts , the nonconserved part @xmath135 has an oscillating factor in time @xmath136 in the heisenberg picture .",
    "its frequency is @xmath137 and is nominally 0.1 - 1 ev or 1 - 10 fsec . as we are observing spins averaged over the time - scale much longer than 1 - 10fsec ,",
    "the only remaining part is the conserved part .",
    "thus , in addition to mathematical soundness , the conserved part of the spin current automatically takes into account this averaging over time . in the next section we shall calculate the d.c .",
    "response in terms of the conserved part of the spin current .",
    "in contrast with the previous approach , the approach using conserved spin @xmath138 gives well - defined and conserved spin current ( [ anticommutator ] ) .",
    "this approach is equivalent to neglect interband matrix elements of spin operators @xmath114 , as seen from ( [ sk - c ] ) .",
    "this is justified in calculation of spin current because of the following reason .",
    "let us consider the problem in a semiclassical way .",
    "two wave - packets in different bands are moving with different velocities , and they will move apart inside the sample . meanwhile , in the sample there are sources causing decoherence between wave - packets , e.g. inelastic scattering .",
    "this decoherence effect smears out the interband matrix elements .",
    "therefore , in the measurement of the spin current , what is measured is only an intraband matrix element of spin carried by a hole coming out of the sample .",
    "thus in the measurement of the spin current , we should consider only the intraband matrix element of @xmath114 .",
    "this is in contrast with calculation of susceptibility , where intraband matrix elements of spin gives significant contributions .    by applying the electric field , this ( conserved ) spin current",
    "is induced by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "let us calculate this linear response according to kubo formula .",
    "hence we shall calculate @xmath139 by evaluating the summation over @xmath124 and taking the trace as presented in appendix [ appendix - kubo ] , we get @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a purely geometric tensor . in the static limit we have , @xmath142 where @xmath143 , @xmath144 are the fermi functions of the lh and the hh bands . here",

    "this quantity does not change if we replace @xmath138 defined in ( [ sk - c ] ) by @xmath190 , which follows from the fact that the helicity is a conserved quantum number .    in a semiclassical ( sc ) approximation , one treats the spin @xmath191 as a classical variable , commuting with the current @xmath192 . under this approximation ,",
    "one obtains @xmath193s^{\\prime l}_{\\text{(c)}}e^{-\\beta h } , \\label{sigmaijkapprox}\\ ] ] where we used the fact that @xmath194 commutes with @xmath195 .",

    "the noncommutativity between the quantum spin and current operators contained in ( [ quantum - sigma ] ) leads to a quantum correction @xmath197 to the semiclassical result ( [ science - result ] ) .",
    "we would like to stress that this difference arises from the definition of spin current . in ( [ prb - result ] )",
    ", we defined the spin current as an anticommutator between velocity and the spin as ( [ anticommutator ] ) .",
    "this definition of spin current amounts to taking the spin as a quantum average between the initial state and the intermediate state in the kubo formula , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ qijab ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", the semiclassical result @xcite corresponds to taking the spin as that of the initial state . in this semiclassical formalism ,",
    "the wave - packets with different helicities have the opposite transverse velocities with respect to the external electric field .",
    "in the present paper , we studied the spin hall effect in hole - doped semiconductors such as ge and gaas .",
    "the four valence bands , which are made out of p - orbitals with the spin - orbit interaction , consists of the doubly degenerate heavy - hole band and light - hole band .",
    "( when we assume the inversion symmetry , the kramers theorem requires at least double degeneracy at each @xmath40-point . ) these two bands touch at the @xmath17-point .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing these valence bands , so - called the luttinger hamiltonian , has a beautiful mathematical structure described by the so(5 ) clifford algebra . at a given momentum @xmath40 , the spin - orbit coupling singles out a fixed direction in the five - dimensional space of the @xmath72 vectors , and breaks the symmetry down to so(4)=su(2)@xmath58su(2 ) .",
    "this symmetry property can be used to define conserved spin currents in both the lh and the hh bands .",
    "the quantum response of the conserved spin current can be calculated exactly within the kubo formalism , and the result is summarized in eq .",
    "( [ prb - result ] ) .",
    "this result can be expressed in terms of purely geometric quantities , or equivalently , in terms of the non - abelian yang monopole field strength , defined in the five - dimensional space of the @xmath72 vectors .",
    "this result also establishes the deep connection between the spin current in the luttinger model and the 4dqhe model of zhang and hu@xcite , which also uses the yang monopole as the non - abelian background gauge field . in the former case",
    ", the yang monopole is defined in momentum space over the space of the five - dimensional @xmath72 vectors , while in the latter case , the yang monopole is defined in the real space .",
    "magnetic monopole structure in the five dimensional momentum space has also been discussed by volovik@xcite .",
    "our fully quantum mechanical results are compared with previous semiclassical one ( [ science - result ] ) , and a quantum correction due to the entanglement of spin and velocity is identified .",
    "the quantum correction can be traced to the non - commutativity and entanglement between the spin and the current operator . in physical systems where this entanglement is destoyed by some decoherence mechanisms , the semiclassical result might be realized . in ref .",
    ", culcer et al .  developed a wavepacket formalism , and discussed the difference between our semiclassical result @xcite and the kubo - formula result ( [ kubo - nonconserved ] ) using the conventional definition of the spin current .",
    "they incorporated the nonzero correlation between spin and velocity into a `` spin dipole '' and `` torque moment '' terms in their wavepacket formalism , and reproduced the kubo - formula result eq .",
    "( [ kubo - nonconserved ] ) after also including a first - order field correction to the wavepacket spin .    in the calculations of the spin current presented in this paper , we assumed an absence of impurities .",
    "on the other hand , we have also done a calculation including a scattering by randomly - distributed impurities . by assuming that the scattering potential is isotropic and accompanies no spin - flip , we calculated the spin current within the born approximation and the ladder approximation for the vertex correction .",
    "the self - energy obtains a finite imaginary part @xmath198 as usual , where @xmath199 is a lifetime .",
    "the vertex correction , on the other hand , vanishes due to the parity , namely because the hamiltonian is an even function of @xmath40 .",
    "thus as far as the broadening of the energy @xmath200 is much smaller than the energy difference between two bands @xmath137 , the spin current calculated in ( [ j - kubo ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "the details of the calculation are involved and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the dissipationless spin current discovered in recent theoretical works has many profound consequences both in fundamental science and in technological applications .",
    "however , in models investigated so far , there is still a finite longitudinal charge conductivity and dissipation associated with charge transport .",
    "a key objective along the current line of research is to identify spin - orbit coupled system with a gap in the electronic excitation spectrum , which might lead to quantized spin hall effect , similar to the familiar quantized hall effect .",
    "this exciting possibility is suggested by the fact that @xmath130 is represented as the integral of the gauge curvature over the occupied states , and does not require the fermi surface across which the particle - hole excitation occurs .",
    "with the expressions for the @xmath201 matrices @xmath202 we get @xmath203 @xmath204 where @xmath205 @xmath30 are the pauli matrices .",
    "let us define the @xmath17 matrices as @xmath206    since @xmath207 , these five matrices generate the so(5 ) clifford algebra @xcite .",
    "we shall define the traceless symmetric tensor @xmath208 by ( [ gamma ] ) , i.e. @xmath209 explicitly they are written as @xmath210 and those obtained by @xmath211 .",
    "they form the vector representation of the so(5 ) algebra , and are expressed as @xmath180 hermitian matices .",

    "this product of two spinor representations can be classified into the irreducible representations of so(5 ) , and each irreducible representation is expressed as a product of the elements of the clifford algebra .",
    "thus @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the spinor representation , @xmath217 is a trivial representation , @xmath218 is a vector representation spanned by @xmath80 , and @xmath219 is an adjoint representation spanned by @xmath83 .",
    "these matrices @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath83 , span the space of 4@xmath584 hermitian matrices .",
    "moreover , because @xmath220 , a product of more than two @xmath17 matrices can be written as a linear combination of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath83 .",
