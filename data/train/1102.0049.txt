    "the classical madelung problem @xcite has an important role in atomic and molecular simulations involving electrostatic interactions .",
    "consider an arbitrary lattice with a unit cell that is composed of @xmath0 charges @xmath1 and let linearly independent vectors @xmath2 denote the lattice vectors . we assume the charge neutrality condition for the unit cell , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "then the madelung problem for calculation of the total electrostatic energy of the unit cell located at the origin can be expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 \\in \\mathbb{r}^{3\\times3}$ ] ( the matrix with lattice vectors as its columns ) and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the atomic position within the unit cell .",
    "the prime on the summation emphasizes that we exclude self - energy , i.e. , for @xmath8 the term @xmath9 is omitted . in order to be able to use the well - established theory of multi - dimensional zeta functions @xcite ,",
    "we introduce the following non - standard representation of electrostatic energy of a unit cell in an arbitrary lattice : @xmath10^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 stands for matrix transport and @xmath12 is a positive - definite matrix ( twice the metric tensor ) , @xmath13 with @xmath14 and the prime on the summation denotes the exclusion of the self energy .",
    "for example , for an orthorhombic lattice with lattice parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 we have @xmath18 for a hexagonal lattice with unit cell vectors @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unit cell parameters , we have @xmath22 one method of calculating the above lattice sum is to use direct sums .",
    "however , it is a well known fact that ( [ ecell ] ) is a conditionally convergent series , which means that ( [ ecell ] ) is meaningless unless the order of summation of the terms is specified .",
    "it is interesting to note that summation over regions that may seem to be natural can diverge . as an example , for a @xmath23-dimensional nacl - type ionic crystal , it was shown that this lattice sum does not converge over expanding spheres @xcite , expanding ellipsoids , and some specific expanding polygons @xcite , but it would converge for expanding cubes @xcite .",
    "the direct summation method is not practical due to the slow rate of convergence .",
    "another method for dealing with ( [ ecell ] ) is to find some analytic continuation for this expression over the complex plane and then to find some fast converging series to evaluate this analytic continuation .",
    "the celebrated ewald method @xcite uses this procedure .",
    "one can write @xmath24 as @xmath25 with @xmath26^{-s/2},\\ ] ] where again the prime denotes the exclusion of any infinite summands .",
    "@xmath27 is a special case of the general epstein zeta functions @xcite .",
    "it is known that @xmath27 is uniformly and absolutely convergent for any complex number @xmath28 with @xmath29 and it has a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex s - plane @xcite . from here on , by @xmath27 we mean its analytic continuation .",
    "@xmath27 is analytic everywhere except for the simple pole at @xmath30 with the residue @xcite @xmath31 using some special functions , it is possible to write @xmath27 and thus @xmath24 in terms of a rapid converging series that recovers the standard ewald method @xcite .",
    "determining the relation between the above - mentioned two methods is not a straightforward task .",
    "specifically , in what order one should sum the terms of the series ( [ ecell ] ) to obtain the ewald s result ?",
    "borwein , et al .",
    "@xcite showed that for nacl - type crystals , summing over cubes would yield the ewald result .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath32 is not a convergent series and since all of the summands are positive , partial sums of this series would be unbounded .",
    "thus , it is meaningless to expect to find @xmath33 using direct sums .    as we mentioned earlier , for nacl - type crystals direct summation over expanding cubes converges while summation over expanding spheres diverges .",
    "one may guess that what makes the expanding cubes to converge is that , unlike expanding spheres , each cube is charge neutral , and thus it may be possible to obtain a converging sequence over spheres if one somehow converts the regular spheres to charge neutral ones .",
    "this is the main idea of the wolf method @xcite and the earlier work of buhler and crandall @xcite . in particular , for a general lattice of charges , wolf , et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that putting a mirror charge on the surface of sphere for each charge inside the sphere and neglecting the charges outside the sphere results in a convergent sequence that converges to the result obtained via ewald method .",
    "although they verified their method by considering several numerical examples , they did not present a rigorous proof .    in this paper , we present the missing proof of the convergence of wolf s method for calculating electrostatic energy of an arbitrary lattice of charges .",
    "we should mention that buhler and crandall @xcite presented a proof for nacl lattice with unit charges . here",

    "but this would be irrelevant in our analysis because as we will see in the sequel , we are interested in the behavior of a continues function of @xmath42 as @xmath48 .",
    "this can be expressed in term of @xmath41 if @xmath42 does not take the discrete values @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and so we can exclude those values",
    ".    in the wolf method one considers spheres with radii @xmath42 centered at each charge of the unit cell at the origin and puts a mirror charge on the surface of the sphere for each charge inside the sphere including center charges .",
