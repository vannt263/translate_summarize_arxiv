    "a sizable fraction of ( and possibly all ) stars are formed in stellar clusters ( lada & lada 2003 , de grijd et al .",
    "2003 , fall et al .",
    "investigations of starburst regions in other galaxies reveal that star clusters are predominantly of low mass . for",
    "the small magellanic cloud and the galaxies m33 and m51 , @xcite find that the initial cluster mass function follows a power law distribution with a slope of about -2 .",
    "the minimum mass in their sample ( @xmath1 ) is mainly a result of observational bias .",
    "the mean mass of star clusters in the solar neighbourhood is @xmath2@xcite , suggesting that the mass function found by @xcite should be extended to even lower masses .",
    "the vast majority ( @xmath3% ) of stars of spectral type o do not belong to a known association , and may have formed in small star clusters @xcite and subsequently been ejected by dynamical slingshots @xcite . from this",
    "it has been argued that the majority of stars are born in small clusters @xcite , many of which may disperse within a few tens of myr of their formation @xcite . in this case , the population of galactic field stars originates mainly from low - mass clusters and , as a consequence , the majority of stellar multiples in the galactic field were also born in relatively small star clusters .",
    "the population of binary stars in the solar neighbourhood has been studied extensively for the field @xcite and for some nearby star clusters @xcite .",
    "higher - order multiplicities are much more difficult to find than binaries .",
    "still , the multiple star catalogue ( msc ) contains 728 systems comprising 37 stars .",
    "the catalogue is claimed to be complete to a distance of 10pc from the sun @xcite . the majority of the listed systems are triples , and orbital parameters are provided where they are available @xcite .",
    "the msc contains 558 triples , 138 quadruples , 25 quintuples , and 7 sextuples .",
    "we define the multiplicity fraction as the number of objects with a given multiplicity divided by the total number of single stars and multiples : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the number of objects with multiplicity @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the sum of the number of single stars ( @xmath8 ) , binaries ( @xmath9 ) , triples ( @xmath10 ) , quadruples ( @xmath11 ) , quintuples ( @xmath12 ) and sextuples ( @xmath13 ) . assuming that 1525% of all systems have multiplicity larger than two @xcite",
    ", we arrive at the following multiplicity fractions : @xmath140.19 , @xmath150.05 , @xmath160.009 and @xmath170.002 .",
    "( a summary of the multiplicities found in the msc and their configuration is presented in table[tab : multipletypes ] . )",
    "if most stars are born in relatively small star clusters , then the majority of the field population must originate in small clusters and the proportions in which single stars , binaries , triples and higher order multiples occur in the field should be reproducible by computer simulations of such star clusters .",
    "once these clusters dissolve , the numbers of higher - order multiples are no longer affected by cluster dynamical evolution , although internal stellar evolution may still affect their relative numbers .",
    "for example , a triple can evolve into a binary when two of its components merge in an unstable phase of roche - lobe overflow .",
    "thus , the relative multiplicity fraction is not frozen in when the cluster dissolves .",
    "stellar evolution tends to reduce the multiplicity , although these effects become less important for older populations .",
    "several recent theoretical studies have discussed the formation of multiple systems .",
    "these studies approach the subject from two distinct perspectives : ( 1 ) stellar dynamical models , in which gravitational interactions are computed between point - mass stars , and ( 2 ) hydrodynamical simulations of protocluster evolution .",
    "purely dynamical interactions between single stars are clearly ineffective in producing a sufficiently high fraction of binaries .",
    "in addition , binary orbital periods tend to be too short @xcite . inclusion of hydrodynamical effects can boost the formation rate of binaries , but at the cost of reducing further their orbital periods @xcite . increasing the number of stars in the simulations worsens the problem , in the sense that typically only a few binaries are formed per star cluster , and higher - order multiples are very rare @xcite . simulations which start with a large proportion of binaries can reproduce the observed binary frequency @xcite , but studies of the formation of higher - order multiples in star clusters containing primordial binaries but no primordial triples fail to reproduce either the fraction or the orbital characteristics of triples observed in the field @xcite .",
    "protocluster evolution , in which gas coagulates to form stars or subclusters in the form of hierarchical stellar systems , may be able to account for a high proportion of binary and possibly triple systems in young star clusters @xcite",
    ". the hydrodynamical breakup of protostellar cores could be a dominant mechanism for the formation of binaries , and possibly triples , in this environment .",
    "these methods , however , fail to produce higher - order multiplicities @xcite . from these studies",
    "it would seem that star clusters can form from their parent molecular cloud with a rich population of binaries and triples , but without significant numbers of quadruples , quintuples , etc . in that case , these multiples must form during the early dynamical evolution of the cluster , by gravitational interactions between single stars , binaries and triples .",
    "in this paper we study the formation and reaction rates of multiple systems in clusters initially containing @xmath18 stars , including a sizable fraction of binaries ( up to 18% ) and triples ( up to 32% ) .",
    "the simulations are carried out by directly integrating newton s equations of motion to an age of approximately 55myr , corresponding roughly to the moment of dissolution of these clusters . during the evolution ,",
    "cluster members engage in long - lasting hierarchical interactions involving up to 11 stars .",
    "we present the dominant interaction channels for multiple stellar encounters in these simulations .",
    "the small star clusters with primordial binaries and triples studied here still under - produce quadruple stellar systems compared to the observed fractions of the galactic disc , although the proportions of quadruples , quintuples and sextuples relative to one another are roughly consistent with observations .",
    "the clusters simulated in this study are initialised by selecting positions and velocities for 100 objects distributed according to a king @xcite model with @xmath19 . for each object",
    "we randomly draw a mass between @xmath20m@xmath21 and @xmath22m@xmath21 from a kroupa mass function @xcite , resulting in a total cluster mass of about 45 . after adding binary and triple components , the masses of the simulated clusters average about 67 . finally , we scale the velocities of all stars and multiple centers of mass in the cluster in such a way that the entire system is in virial equilibrium , in standard _ n_body  units @xcite , and scale the cluster to a virial radius @xmath23pc , corresponding to a half - mass radius of about 0.08pc .",
    "given the rapid expansion of the clusters in the first few myr we consider this a reasonable choice .",
    "we call this model s ( see tab.[tab : summary ] ) . for a @xmath24 star cluster in the solar neighbourhood , the jacobi radius in the galactic tidal field is @xmath25pc , which is an order of magnitude larger than the initial tidal radius of the adopted king model . for clarity",
    "we therefore neglect the tidal field in our simulations .",
    "note that later we describe additional simulations with larger initial cluster radii , in which case this assumption may break down .",
    "starting from model s , we generate model b by randomly selecting 50 stars , which are converted into binaries by adding a companion ( secondary ) star and orbital parameters . again , before starting the simulation , the velocities of all single stars and binary centres of mass are rescaled so that the entire system is again in virial equilibrium .",
    "the mass of the secondary is randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between @xmath26 and the mass of the primary .",
    "the orbital parameters are chosen from empirical distributions describing approximately the inner orbits of hierarchical triple systems in the msc @xcite .",
    "the orbital period @xmath27 of the binaries is selected by generating a random variable @xmath28 between 0 and 1 and setting @xmath29 the eccentricity for each binary orbit is generated by selecting another random number @xmath30 uniformly in [ 0,1 ) , and defining @xmath31 if for any binary , the separation at periastron is smaller than five times the maximum stellar radius ( from @xcite ) , new orbital parameters are selected randomly .",
    "these distributions ( eqs.[eq : pbin ] & [ eq : ebin ] ) are presented in figures[fig : periods ] and [ fig : eccentricities ] and compared with the msc data . for clarity , and due to our lack of understanding of selection effects in the discovery of multiple systems",
    ", we decided deliberately to stay close to the observed distributions for the orbital period and eccentricity .",
    "an additional argument for this choice is that our simple prescription for the generation of initial conditions allows our initial conditions to be easily reproduced .",
    "the fact that the binary period distribution does not exactly reproduce the observed distribution is therefore not a major concern .",
    "the other binary parameters ( inclination , orbital phase and ascending node ) are chosen randomly @xcite .     and [ eq : ptrip ] . ]     and [ eq : etrip ] . ]",
    "model t is generated by adding a third ( outer ) star to 32 randomly selected binaries in model b. the faction of triples thus obtained is based on the observed fraction of higher order systems in the solar neighborhood .",
    "no simulations were performed with primordial quadruples or higher - order hierarchies . the mass of the tertiary star is randomly chosen between @xmath26 and the mass of the inner binary .",
    "the orbital period @xmath32 for the outer orbit of the triple is selected from a distribution approximating the observed msc distribution of outer orbital periods in triples : @xmath33 and the eccentricity for the outer orbit is generated with @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "the other parameters for the outer orbit are chosen randomly , as for the binary orbits .",
    "finally , we check the stability of the triple using eq.90 from @xcite , and new parameters for the outer orbit are selected randomly if the triple turns out to be dynamically unstable , or if the separation at pericentre between the outer star and the binary is less than five times the maximum stellar radius . as in model b ,",
    "the entire system is then restored to virial equilibrium by rescaling the velocities of single stars and the centre of mass velocities of binaries and triples .",
    "figure[fig : periods ] compares the observed distributions for the inner and outer orbital period with the distribution generated as initial conditions for our simulations .",
    "figure[fig : eccentricities ] presents a similar comparison for eccentricities .",
    "note that our orbital separations and eccentricities are uncorrelated with one another .",
    ".[tab : summary ] initial parameters and final fraction of higher - order multiples for the various simulations .",
    "each simulation consists of 100 ` particles ' which can be single stars , binaries , or triple systems . with the adopted number of binaries ( @xmath37 ) and triples ( @xmath38 ) the total number of stars @xmath39 then ranges between 100 to 182 .",
    "each simulation was initialised from a king model with @xmath40 and with a virial radius @xmath41pc .",
    "some additional simulations were performed with larger virial radii ( 1pc and 3pc ) . when the simulations are terminated at @xmath42myr ,",

    "we present an overview of the transients and persistent multiples created in simulation model t. the multiples which escape the cluster are included in this table , as well as the multiples which remain bound .",
    "a single star in these tables is identified by the letter",
    "s. we denote a pair of bound objects by putting parentheses around them , with the more massive of the two always to the left . for brevity",
    "we introduce separate notation for a binary ( a pair of stars ) , which we write as b @xmath46 ( s , s ) .",
    "a triple can have two configurations : ( b , s ) if the binary is more massive than the star orbiting it , or ( s , b ) if the outer star is more massive .",
    "table[tab : multipletypes ] draws a distinction between the total number of configurations and those which are persistent .",
    "table[tab : multiplereduced ] compares the simulated hierarchies directly with those observed .",
    "the most long - lived multiple configuration , on average , consists of 4 stars arranged in the classical quartet ( b , b ) , in which two binaries orbit one another . a total of 1171 reactions led to such a configuration . of these , 290 resulted in persistent systems , with an average lifetime of about 20myr .",
    "aarseth @xcite has commented on the formation of such binary  binary systems , and on their longer lifetimes compared to other , less compact , configurations . due to their smaller cross sections , they are less likely to have a fatal encounter with another object than are strictly hierarchical systems",
    ". the ratios of the numbers of the various quadruple configurations to the total number of quadruples in the msc are : 0.50 for ( b , b ) , 0.44 for ( ( b , s),s ) , 0.05 for ( ( s , b),s ) and ( s,(b , s ) ) .",
    "the configuration ( s,(s , b ) ) , in which the inner binary is less massive than the two single stars orbiting it , has not been observed .    to compare these numbers with the results of our simulations of model t",
    ", we multiply the frequencies at which these various configurations are formed by their average lifetimes .",
    "the probability of observing any of the above quadruple configurations during a simulation is then 0.54 for ( b , b ) , 0.23 for ( ( b , s),s ) , 0.14 for ( ( s , b),s ) , 0.07 for ( s,(b , s ) ) , and 0.01 for the unobserved ( s,(s , b ) ) .",
    "these relative ratios are comparable to those actually observed .    in the observations it is often hard to determine the masses of the component stars , so we present in table[tab : multiplereduced ] a reduced version of table[tab : multipletypes ] , in which we list the observed numbers of hierarchies , but group all systems with the same physical hierarchy together .",
    "thus , quadruple systems are reduced to just two types ( b , b ) and ( ( b , s),s ) , the latter category then contains all possible permutations in which a binary is orbited by two single stars : ( ( b , s),s ) , ( ( s , b),s ) , ( s,(b , s ) ) and ( s,(s , b ) ) . among the quintuple configurations ,",
    "the strictly hierarchical systems ( ( b , s),s),s ) are vastly outnumbered by the triple / binary pairs ( ( b , s),b ) in the simulations as well as in the observations . in the observed sample ,",
    "however , permutations of ( ( b , s),b ) are much more abundant than in our simulations .",
    "the differences between the occurrences of observed and simulated multiplicities is quite striking .",

    "we concentrate on the individual formation and destruction reactions for multiplicities of up to 6 stars .",
    "figure[fig : singlereactions ] presents the most common reactions leading to the ` creation ' ( liberation ) of single stars due to the gravitational decay of multiple systems ( left ) , and the corresponding ` destruction ' ( consumption ) reactions resulting in the loss of single stars ( right ) .",
    "each ` ladder ' represents a reaction channel ; the symbols s , b and t on the rungs refer to single , binary and triple stars , respectively .",
    "an arrow is drawn from the originating level to the final state of the system .",
    "dashed arrows indicate the reduction of a higher - order system to one of lower order  a binary being disrupted or a triple being reduced to a single star and a binary .",
    "such a reduction could be caused by an encounter with another cluster member , by stellar evolution ( e.g. a supernova event ) or , in the case of triple reduction , by the internal dynamics of a dynamically unstable system .",
    "these different scenarios are not represented separately in these diagrams because the effect on the multiplicity of the components is the same .",
    "solid arrows indicate capture , as when a single star or small system combines ( typically in the presence of another cluster member ) with another small system to form a higher order multiple .",
    "note that , although this presentation might suggest that interactions occur in isolation , this is usually not the case .",
    "many interactions take place near the core of the cluster , and there may be many other stars nearby which can carry away small amounts of energy and angular momentum .",
    "it is sometimes hard to identify the star(s ) responsible for the binding energy and angular momentum of a post - encounter bound pair .",
    "our simulations include stellar and binary evolution and allow for stellar collisions to take place , but in order not to unnecessarily complicate matters , these processes are not displayed separately here .",
    "the number at the top of each reaction channel indicates its relative frequency in our simulations .",
    "thus the left panel in figure[fig : singlereactions ] presents reactions in which single stars are created by the ionisation of a binary ( 40% ) or by destruction of a hierarchical triple ( 20% ) , whereas the right panel describes the ` destruction ' of single stars by absorption into a higher - order system binary ( 39% ) or triple ( 22% ) .",
    "the sums of the creation and destruction frequencies should each be unity , but for clarity only the most important reactions are shown .",
    "the remaining interactions comprise a wealth of low - probability , sometimes rather arcane reactions contributing to the overall cluster evolution .",
    "figures[fig : binaryreactions][fig : sextuplereactions ] show analogous reaction channels for the formation and destruction of binary through sextuple systems . the symbols qd , qn and sx refer to quadruples , quintuples and sextuples .",
    "note the important role played by triples in the formation of higher - order multiples .",
    "quadruples and quintuples are most commonly formed from a triple that absorbs a single star or a binary , whereas sextuples tend to form from the combination of two triples .",
    "( see also table[tab : multipletypes ] , where sextuples consisting of two triples orbiting one another are relatively common . )",
    "we find similar trends in the destruction of the higher - order multiples .",
    "in particular , the decay of sextuples to form two triples is quite striking .",
    "the reaction frequencies presented in these figures are computed for the entire simulation of model t , even though one might argue that the early phase of rapid multiple creation ( @xmath49myr ) could produce reactions different from those found the later , slower phase of the evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : quad_quin_nrs ] ) .",
    "interestingly , there is no significant difference between the types of reactions seen during the early and late phases .",
    "it is not trivial to compare orbital parameters of the observed multiples with those in the simulations , in part due to the large number of parameters and due to severe selection effects .",
    "complete orbital solutions are not available for any of the multiples listed in the msc , but for four quadruples the msc lists the orbital periods and eccentricities for each of the three orbits and also the masses of the four stars ; those systems are hd08065 + 1757 , hd05569 + 0939 , hd11128 + 3205 and hd11171 - 2414 .",
    "nevertheless we attempt to compare the orbits of the multiples in the msc with those obtained in our simulations . for clarity",
    "we limit ourselves here to the population of quadruple systems .",
    "fig.[fig : orbital_parameters_quads ] ( top panel ) shows the orbital separations and eccentricities for all quadruples in the msc .",
    "the bottom panel shows the same information for persistent quadruples at an age of 55myr for model t. small symbols indicate hierarchical systems ( ( b , s ) , s ) , whereas large symbols show data for the ( b , b ) configuration . for hierarchical quadruples , the outermost , intermediate , and inner orbits",
    "are represented by small bullets , triangles , and circles , respectively . for binary  binary systems , the large bullets represent the outer orbit , while the large triangles and circles indicate , respectively , the inner orbits containing the most massive and least massive stars . many of the ` outer ' orbits in the observed quadruples are missing from the sample in the msc , which reflects the few bullets in fig.[fig : orbital_parameters_quads ] . the outer orbits seem to be cut off at around @xmath50au .",
    "the simulated sample of outer orbits , however , extends all the way to about @xmath51au .",
    "the few known outer orbits in the observed sample of quadruple systems strongly suggests that these orbits are simply not observed , and that the observational selection effect becomes important at around a few hundred au .",
    "there does not seem to be a specific selection effect regarding the orbital parameters of the inner binary orbits in the 69 ( b , b ) quadruples listed in the msc , as for the primary as well as the secondary binary a total of 46 are observed . the inter - binary orbit , however , is quite heavily affected by selection effects , as the msc lists only 10 binaries with known period and eccentricity ( the large bullets in the top panel of fig.[fig : orbital_parameters_quads ] ) .",
    "these different selection effects are best seen in the large number of missing bullets in the top panel of fig.[fig : orbital_parameters_quads ] , which suggests that the outer orbits in hierarchical systems , as well as the inter - binary orbits in ( b , b ) systems , are severely affected by observational selection effects .",
    "the other seem to be rather well represented by the observations , with the possible exception of the larger number of circularized binaries in the observation and some excess of short period eccentric binaries in the simulations .",
    "this suggests that tidal circularisation in our simulations is less effective that in nature .",
    "this should not come as a surprise , as tidal effects are not taken into account in higher order systems in which an inner binary is perturbed by an outer object , as is often the case in these quadruple systems .",
    "we have performed similar analyses comparing the orbital parameters for the quintuples and sextuple systems in the msc with simulation t , and the results of these are quite similar , in the sense that the observational selection effects for determining orbital parameters gradually increase for larger periods . in these cases",
    "we also find that the simulations tend to overproduce short - period systems with high eccentricities relative to the observations , at the expense of short - period circular orbits .",
    "we decided not to show the plots for these higher order multiples , as the quality of the observational data declines with increasing multiplicity .",
    "we have performed simulations of star clusters which initially consisted of single stars , binaries and triples .",
    "the initial conditions were selected to match the young ( @xmath52myr ) star clusters in the solar neighbourhood , consisting of at most a few hundred stars .",
    "the initial conditions for the binaries and triples were selected based on the observed populations , which we transform directly to input parameters . for simplicity ,",
    "observational selection effects are neglected , both in determining the distribution functions from which we generate our initial conditions , and in our final comparison with observations .",
    "after initialisation we run the simulations for about 55myr ( corresponding to about 1000 n - body time units , or about 350 dynamical crossing times of the system ) and compare our results with the observed star clusters and multiples in the field .",
    "our models with initial half - mass radii of about 0.1pc are consistent with several observed young ( @xmath53myr ) star clusters .",
    "the rapid expansion of our simulated clusters is attributed partly to stellar mass loss and partly to dynamical effects .",
    "our simulations fail to explain the small ( @xmath54pc ) star clusters at ages @xmath55myr , although we argue that proper inclusion of tidal effects would mitigate this discrepancy .    the stars in the simulations are initially distributed as single stars , binaries and triples . during the evolution , multiple systems containing more than 4 stars form as a result of strong dynamical interactions among primordial single stars , binaries and triples .",
    "after the first few million years the fraction of higher - order systems remains roughly constant .",
    "our simulation models form significant numbers of hierarchical systems consisting of four or more stars when compared to similar simulations without primordial triples .",
    "we measure the fractions of systems containing up to 6 stars , and find a steady increase in their number . after the start of the simulation",
    "the number of higher - order multiples rapidly increases up to an age of about 2myr , after which their net formation rate drops by about a factor of 20 .",
    "the number of multiples consisting of 4 stars increases at about twice the rate as those containing 5 stars , which again increase at about twice the rate of system with 6 stars .    among the higher - order multiples that form in our simulations ,",
    "the strictly hierarchical systems are the least likely to survive .",
    "this is most easily seen in the quadruples , among which the configuration consisting of two binaries orbiting one another are by far the most common . among the quintuples",
    "the most likely stable configuration is a triple star orbited by a binary .",
    "most sextuple systems consist of two triples orbiting one another .",
    "the relative frequency of stable hierarchies in our simulations is generally comparable to those observed in msc , but with some notable exceptions . in four observed systems , a massive binary",
    "is hierarchically orbited by three single stars . in our simulations",
    "such sextuple systems are extremely rare ( relative frequency @xmath56% ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a sextuple system consisting of three binaries orbiting one another as a hierarchical triple is quite common in our simulations , but none are observed in the population of multiple systems in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "these interesting differences may originate from observational selection effects or from specific choices in our initial conditions .",
    "we also present the principal interactions in which multiple stars are created and destroyed .",
    "reactions in which single stars ( @xmath57% ) or triples ( @xmath58% ) participate are most common , simply because such systems are most abundant .",
    "most sextuple systems are formed from an interaction between two triple systems , and most quadruples form from a triple and a single star .",
    "the actual relative importance of various reactions in the network may be quite different for a different choice of initial conditions .",
    "the initial fractions of stars , binaries and triples may play a crucial role here , and a shallower initial density profile may boost the number of high order multiples and may even allow for systems containing larger numbers of stars .",

    "<S> we simulate open clusters containing up to 182 stars initially in the form of singles , binaries and triples . due to the high interaction rate a large number of stable quadruples , quintuples , sextuples , and higher - order hierarchies form during the course of the simulations . for our choice of initial conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the formation rate of quadruple systems after about 2myr is roughly constant with time at @xmath0 per cluster per myr . </S>",
    "<S> the formation rate of quintuple and sextuple systems are about half and one quarter , respectively , of the quadruple formation rate , and both rates are also approximately constant with time . </S>",
    "<S> we present reaction channels and relative probabilities for the formation of persistent systems containing up to six stars . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction networks for the formation and destruction of quintuple and sextuple systems can become quite complicated , although the branching ratios remain largely unchanged during the course of the cluster evolution . the total number of quadruples is about a factor of three smaller than observed in the solar neighbourhood .    </S>",
