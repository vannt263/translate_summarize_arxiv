    "motivated by the recently discovered superconductivity@xcite in na@xmath1coo@xmath2h@xmath3o ( @xmath8 ) and the unusual electronic properties@xcite of the series , we began a study of he @xmath9 model on a triangular lattice,@xcite focusing primarily on the renormalized fermi liquid regime .",
    "we pointed out that nearest neighbor repulsion can lead to significant renormalization of the effective hopping amplitude , which seems to be the case in these materials .",
    "we also argued that strong repulsion drives this model into a @xmath5 charge ordered state near commensurate dopings @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "we continue this study here and perform a systematic slave boson meanfield analysis of the fermi liquid close to the charge density wave ( cdw ) state for dopings near @xmath0 .",
    "we also consider the residual interaction between the quasiparticles and study which superconductivity channels are favored in the @xmath9 model on the triangular lattice .",
    "of particular interest here is possible enhancement of some channels due to charge fluctuations upon approaching the cdw phase .",
    "such studies of superconductivity due to residual interaction in the models with strong local repulsion are familiar in the high-@xmath11 field .",
    "scalapino@xcite studied the hubbard model on a 3d cubic lattice in a random phase approximation ( rpa ) and found that @xmath12-wave pairing becomes attractive close to the spin density wave transition .",
    "kotliar and liu@xcite studied the infinite-@xmath13 hubbard model on a 2d square lattice in a systematic large-@xmath4 treatment and found that the residual interaction from the no - double - occupancy constraint favors @xmath12-wave superconductivity close to half filling .",
    "more recently , mckenzie@xcite applied the analysis of kotliar and liu to extended hubbard model on the square lattice at quarter filling and found a transition to the @xmath14 cdw , which is driven by the nearest neighbor repulsion .",
    "merino and mckenzie@xcite studied superconducting instabilities of the fermi liquid near this transition .",
    "it is of interest to perform similar studies on the triangular lattice .",
    "rpa treatment in the spirit of scalapino@xcite has been done by tanaka@xcite very recently .",
    "they find that in the regime of interest for na@xmath1coo@xmath2h@xmath3o , a particular @xmath7-wave triplet channel is favored close to the cdw instability .    here",
    ", we report a kotliar - liu type analysis for the triangular lattice , which has not been done so far .",
    "the advantage of our approach over the rpa is that the treatment of the strong on - site repulsion is better controlled .    in our study",

    "the origin of this result can be understood from the following fermi surface nesting argument .    in an rpa - type treatment ,",

    "this can be also written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] is the full susceptibility in rpa .",
    "now , @xmath22 is negative over some portion of the bz , in particular at the @xmath5 ordering wavevectors such as @xmath23 , so for sufficiently large @xmath24 there is an instability at which @xmath25 diverges .",
    "( [ veff ] ) shows that close to the instability the effective interaction becomes strongly attractive at the ordering wavevectors .",
    "if there are sections of the fermi surface that are nearly connected by such wavevectors , then we expect enhanced superconductivity in channels that utilize this nesting .",
    "our calculation using slave boson theory also produces attractive effective interactions due to charge fluctuations .",
    "the difference is that now the effective potential depends on @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the electrons , rather than @xmath28 . near the fermi surface",
    "we write this as @xmath29 and we find that @xmath30 has attractive components when @xmath31 and @xmath32 are connected by an ordering vector @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ nesting ] shows the situation for doping @xmath0 ( drawn to scale ) .",
    "it turns out that at this filling the fermi surface lies fairly close to the reduced bz corresponding to the @xmath5 order .",
    "we also show the gap function @xmath34 of the dominant @xmath7-wave state .",
    "this has large absolute values in the directions of the @xmath16 points of the full bz boundary and signs as shown  positive sign near black diamonds and negative sign for white diamonds . with an attractive @xmath35 , pairing between the black diamonds and also pairing between the white diamonds",
    "are very favorable , since the black diamonds are nearly connected among themselves by ordering wavevectors , and so are the white diamonds .",
    "we should of course consider the near nesting of other fermi surface segments as well .",

    "these points are also nearly connected by an ordering vector and this pairing would favor a spin singlet state . as an example , an @xmath37-wave state gains from all points @xmath38 that are connected by @xmath39 .",
    "the reason why the @xmath37-wave channel is still disfavored is that there remains significant overall repulsion over non - nested @xmath40 that it can not avoid .",

    "the phase diagram is established .",
    "we then study fluctuations over the uniform saddle point in @xmath6 expansion , and focus on the residual quasiparticle interactions from such fluctuations .",
    "this approach can be viewed as a version of rpa that treats the on - site constraint systematically , and provides a more quantitative justification of the above nesting argument .",

    "since @xmath184 , this can have dramatic effect on the calculated @xmath11 .",
    "we now consider in some detail how the above results apply to the original spin-1/2 model . to this end",
    ", we have performed a systematic trial wavefunction study of the @xmath9 model .",
    "specifically , we consider a family of jastrow - gutzwiller wavefunctions@xcite @xmath185 \\det\\left[\\psi_\\alpha(r_j^\\prime ) \\right ] ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath186 and @xmath187 denote the positions of spin - up and spin - down fermions respectively , and the wavefunction is nonzero only when the two sets do not overlap , which is the result of gutzwiller projection .",
    "@xmath188 refer to appropriate single - particle states that are occupied in the `` preprojected '' wavefunction .",
    "each configuration of fermions is also weighted by a jastrow factor defined via two - particle pseudopotentials @xmath189 , which puts additional correlations into the wavefunction .",
    "the fermi liquid state is obtained by occupying appropriate plane wave states @xmath190 , @xmath191 . from our studies of the @xmath9 model , we conclude that already the nearest - neighbor jastrow factor gives good control over local correlations and is sufficient for an accurate energetics distinction between the fermi liquid and competing charge ordered state .    as discussed at length in ref .  , lattice gas system described by the nearest - neighbor @xmath192 undergoes a transition to a @xmath5 state for large @xmath193 .",
    "our direct optimization with such single - parameter wavefunction showed that this state is driven into the charge - ordered regime for sufficiently strong repulsion @xmath24 and dopings in the range @xmath194 .",
    "we also mentioned that once this happens , we are no longer justified in using plane waves for the preprojected orbitals .",
    "we should instead consider more general single - particle states ; for example , we consider orbitals obtained by diagonalizing a `` trial '' hamiltonian @xmath195 where we allow generic hopping amplitudes @xmath196 and site potentials @xmath197 that follow the @xmath5 ordering pattern .",
    "specifically , we select the @xmath124 sublattice and take @xmath198 , @xmath199 ; @xmath200 makes the hopping more dice - lattice - like , while @xmath201 makes it more honeycomb - like .",
    "we also use the convention @xmath202 and vary @xmath133 . observe that this structure of the trial hamiltonian is suggested by the meanfield treatment of the fermi liquid - cdw competition in sec .",
    "[ sec : meanfield ] , and in fact by any such meanfield .",
    "however , our wavefunctions have further local correlations built in by the jastrow factors which allow the liquid to better accommodate the nearest - neighbor repulsion ( also leading to significant renormalization of the bandwidth as discussed in ref .  ) , while this is missing in the meanfield .",
    "we summarize our wavefunction studies for three dopings @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath179 .",
    "we report only the result of the three - parameter @xmath205 optimization . when @xmath206 , we obtain the fermi liquid state .",
    "as discussed earlier , this restricted study should suffice for an accurate determination of the uniform liquid to cdw transition .    for dopings @xmath207 and @xmath179",
    ", we find rather abrupt transitions to the @xmath5 state at @xmath208 and @xmath209 . on the other hand , for the doping @xmath203",
    ", the system shows no ordering till very large @xmath210 to @xmath211 and maybe even higher . comparing with fig .",
    "[ mfphased ] , the behavior at this lowest doping is very different from the meanfield prediction .",
    "this is an extreme manifestation of the fact that the charges are able to effectively avoid each other and remain in the liquid state , which is captured by our jastrow - gutzwiller wavefunction , while the meanfield uniform state can not accommodate this and pays large repulsion energy cost .",
    "finally , having established the dominant local energetics , we also tried adding superconducting correlations on top of the renormalized fermi liquid state .",
    "we tried several superconducting ansatz including extended @xmath37-wave , @xmath212 , @xmath44 , @xmath7-wave , and also their nnn versions .",
    "however , in our studies we were not able to detect any improvement in the energetics upon adding superconductivity . from this we conclude that if some such state appears at low energies , the condensation energy is still very small to be detected by direct numerical studies .",
    "in this situation , we are left to rely on approximate analytical calculations such as discussed in the main body of this paper .",
