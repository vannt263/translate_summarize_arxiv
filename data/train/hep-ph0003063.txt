    "the @xmath1 supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) and the @xmath7 superstring theory are good candidates for unified theories of elementary particle physics .",
    "while such theories manifest themselves at the ultrahigh energy scale ( @xmath8 gev ) , it is natural to expect that they have some effects on physics at the electroweak scale ( @xmath9 gev ) @xcite .",
    "it is , however , difficult to determine precisely what effective theory actually appears at the electroweak scale .",
    "this may be understood by considering the facts that the @xmath1 susy gut has many possible symmetry breaking patterns and that the superstring theory has many possible compactification patterns .",
    "hence , in the present experimental circumstances , it will not be so useful to perform detailed investigations on specific models .",
    "we are rather interested in the general aspects of the low - energy effects of the unified theories .",
    "particularly , in this article we study the effects on lepton physics at the electroweak scale . in the standard model ,",
    "the lepton number and flavor are conserved automatically .",
    "hence , if the processes violating these quantum numbers are observed , including the neutrino masses and oscillations , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and so on , they indeed provide important information of new physics above the electroweak scale .    in the supersymmetric models with supergravity scenario @xcite , which would be derived from the unified theories , the renormalization effects on the soft supersymmetry breaking terms may induce sizable lepton flavor violation .",
    "these lepton flavor violating renormalization effects are actually obtained in the susy gut @xcite and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with heavy right - handed neutrinos @xcite . here , as another intriguing possibility for lepton flavor violation ,",
    "we investigate the supersymmetric standard model incorporating vectorlike @xmath0 doublet leptons @xcite .",
    "especially , the significant slepton mixing may be generated by radiative corrections with the couplings between the ordinary leptons and these exotic leptons .",
    "it is remarkable that this new physics with exotic leptons can be discovered just around the electroweak scale in contrast to the cases of gut and right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the present model is motivated by the @xmath1 type unification .",
    "the @xmath1 * 27 * representation contains one generation of the ordinary quarks and leptons in the standard model , the vectorlike @xmath0 singlet quarks , the vectorlike @xmath0 doublet leptons , the right - handed neutrino , and the @xmath0 singlet higgs field",
    ". the ordinary left - handed neutrinos may acquire majorana masses through the seesaw mechanism with the right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "these ordinary neutrino masses can be very small as required phenomenologically , if the right - handed neutrinos are superheavy or if they have extremely small yukawa couplings with the left - handed lepton doublets .",
    "hence , given the small ordinary neutrino masses , we do not consider further the effects of the right - handed neutrinos in the electroweak physics . in this investigation",
    ", we concentrate on the lepton flavor violating effects of the vectorlike lepton doublets @xmath12 and their scalar superpartners .",
    "specifically , these supersymmetric effects of the exotic leptons may provide the significant br(@xmath10 ) , while the lepton flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) at the tree level are suppressed naturally by the hierarchy of the charged lepton masses .",
    "the down type quark singlets @xmath13 are also present in the @xmath1 unification , which may form the @xmath14 of su(5 ) subgroup with @xmath15 .",
    "the survival of these exotic particles to the electroweak scale depends on the symmetry breakings .",
    "the @xmath16-@xmath17 mass splitting in the * 5 * can be realized with suitable higgs multiplets , e.g. the * 351 * of @xmath1 including the * 24 * of su(5 ) , as usually considered to obtain the light @xmath18 doublet higgs field .",
    "hence , it is possible that @xmath19 survive while @xmath20 become superheavy in the * 27*. it may also be considered in the superstring theory that @xmath19 become light while @xmath20 do not in the @xmath21 . on the other hand , @xmath20 and",

    "then , it should be noted in these cases , whether @xmath20 survive or not , that the simple @xmath1 relations no longer hold for the yukawa couplings after the @xmath1 breaking . in particular ,",
    "the flavor violating couplings with @xmath19 may be described independently of those with @xmath20 .",
    "given this general situation , we concentrate on the lepton flavor violation with @xmath19 in the present article .",
    "a detailed examination of the quark flavor violation with @xmath20 , particularly the supersymmetric effects , is reserved for a separate publication .",
    "( such supersymmetric effects are investigated in ref.@xcite in a context different from the present one . )",
    "of course , if @xmath20 and @xmath19 originate in the same * 27 * , the flavor violating effects of these exotic leptons and quarks will be provided from some common @xmath1 coupling . in this specific case",
    ", the calculations made in the present analysis for the lepton flavor violation such as @xmath22 can be extended readily for the quark flavor violation such as @xmath23-@xmath24 mixing .",
    "simple order estimates , as will be quoted occasionally in the text , indicate that the constraints from the quark flavor violating effects are in fact less stringent than those from the lepton flavor violating effects .",

    "we show that the modification of the gauge interactions provided by this lepton mixing is fairly suppressed even if the relevant flavor violating yukawa couplings take significant values .",

    "if the universal form is assumed for the supersymmetry breaking terms at @xmath41 , this flavor symmetry @xmath198 is still preserved in the limit @xmath194 .",
    "this is the case even if the renormalization group corrections are included .",
    "therefore , we find that in the limit @xmath194 corresponding to @xmath201 , the @xmath22 decay is prevented for the electron number conservation by the @xmath198 .",
    "similarly , the decay amplitudes of @xmath22 depend on @xmath161 as well due to the approximate @xmath202 symmetry .",
    "it should further be remarked that even for the case with several pairs of vectorlike lepton doublets , the @xmath22 decay amplitudes are dominantly given by eq.([46 ] ) in the model ( 1 ) without the bare mass term @xmath203 .",
    "this can be justified by extending readily the above symmetry argument .",
    "in order to confirm the estimate of @xmath5 given in eq.([47 ] ) , we have made numerical calculations by taking reasonable values of the model parameters . in the model ( 1 ) ,",
    "the most important parameters are @xmath6 and @xmath56 for the ordinary - exotic lepton mixing .",
    "the values of @xmath204 are determined so as to reproduce the actual lepton masses @xmath205 .",
    "the exotic leptons @xmath206 and @xmath207 have typically the masses @xmath208 by taking @xmath209 and @xmath210 .    in fig.[l2v1 ] , br(@xmath2 ) is shown as a function of @xmath211 by taking randomly the values of @xmath56 .",
    "we have also taken typically @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "it is clearly observed in fig.[l2v1 ] that br(@xmath2 ) is roughly proportional to @xmath220 , as indicated in eq.([47 ] ) .",
    "the relation between br(@xmath2 ) and @xmath221 is shown in fig.[tanv1 ] . here",
    ", we have taken typically @xmath213 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "this result indicates the strong @xmath221 dependence as @xmath226 .",
    "it is , in particular , interesting that if @xmath6 is larger than 20 , @xmath5 might be comparable to the experimental bound @xmath227 @xcite .    as for the @xmath228 decay ,",
    "the penguin diagrams associated with fig.[meg ] provide dominant contributions in the present model with @xmath229 , as is usually the case @xcite .",
    "the tree - level @xmath134 mediated fcnc s given in eq.([21 ] ) provide only a contribution smaller by a few orders .",
    "we have also the supersymmetric contributions to @xmath230 and @xmath231 , which are estimated in eq.([47 ] ) by replacing the relevant charged lepton masses and the @xmath56 couplings .",
    "in particular , @xmath232 is enhanced as @xmath233 which can be comparable to the experimental bound @xmath234 @xcite",
    ". therefore , in the model ( 1 ) the @xmath231 decay seems to be more promising to observe the lepton flavor violation due to the ordinary - exotic lepton mixing with supersymmetry .",
    "the @xmath127 coupling may also contribute to the flavor violation in the quark sector if the quark singlets @xmath20 survive as well to the electroweak scale in the @xmath1 unification .",
    "then , we have dominantly the right - handed squark mixings such as @xmath235 , which are the same as the right - handed slepton mixings given in eqs.([43 ] ) with ( [ 44 ] ) .",
    "it is clearly found that even for @xmath236 this squark mixing is much smaller than the bound @xmath237 obtained from the @xmath23-@xmath24 system @xcite .      in the model ( 2 ) , we have more significant contributions for the right - handed decay amplitudes .",
    "this is because the @xmath3 considered in the case of model ( 1 ) is substantially violated due to the presence of bare mass term @xmath238 of the vectorlike lepton doublets .",
    "actually , the soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms for the ordinary slepton doublets @xmath239 and the vectorlike slepton doublet @xmath240 acquire the renormalization group corrections in somewhat different way with @xmath65 .",
    "then , we have an extra terms for @xmath241 and @xmath242 as @xmath243 this extra term provides the significant mixing for the left - handed sleptons as @xmath244 where the similarity @xmath245 is considered .",
    "these left - handed slepton mixings can be taken for the one - loop diagrams similar to those considered in the model ( 1 ) with chirality change @xmath246 .",
    "then , we obtain the contributions to the @xmath22 decay amplitude as @xmath247 it is here important that these supersymmetric contributions are no longer suppressed by the very small extra factor @xmath248 as seen in eq.([46 ] ) for the model ( 1 ) .",
    "we roughly estimate the branching ratio as @xmath249 as seen in eq.([51 ] ) , the chirality of the charged leptons is mainly specified as @xmath250 in the model ( 2 ) contrary to the case of model ( 1 ) .",
    "it is also mentioned that this significant supersymmetric contribution to @xmath5 may be obtained even in the model ( 1 ) , if the soft slepton masses squared @xmath251 are different between @xmath252 and @xmath253 already at @xmath41 for some reason .",
    "we have also made numerical calculations to evaluate @xmath5 in the model ( 2 ) with the bare mass term , which is expected to be much larger than in the model ( 1 ) .    in fig.[l2 ] , br(@xmath2 ) is shown as a function of @xmath211 by taking randomly the values of @xmath56 .",
    "we have also taken typically @xmath254 , @xmath213 , @xmath255 , @xmath215 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "it is clearly observed in fig.[l2 ] that br(@xmath2 ) is roughly proportional to @xmath220 , as indicated in eq.([52 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe in fig.[l2 ] that @xmath5 becomes comparable to the experimental bound @xmath260 @xcite for the rather small ordinary - exotic couplings @xmath261 with the moderate value of @xmath262 .",
    "the relation between br(@xmath2 ) and the gravitino mass @xmath263 is shown in fig.[largem0 ] for @xmath264 with somewhat larger @xmath265 , where the other parameters are taken typically as @xmath254 , @xmath213 , @xmath215 , @xmath266 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "it is here noticed that cancellation between the neutralino and chargino contributions occurs for certain values of @xmath263 , where br(@xmath2 ) becomes substantially small .",
    "it is also remarkable in the model ( 2 ) that even for the relatively large soft supersymmetry breaking with @xmath267 , br(@xmath2 ) can be comparable to the experimental bound by taking the relatively large ordinary - exotic lepton couplings @xmath268 .",
    "we have also the supersymmetric contributions to @xmath230 and @xmath231 , which are estimated in eq.([51 ] ) by replacing @xmath161 with @xmath269 and the @xmath56 couplings",
    ". the resultant branching ratios of @xmath230 and @xmath231 are similar to that of @xmath22 , since they are almost independent of @xmath269 in this case .",
    "therefore , by considering the experimental bounds on the branching ratios , the @xmath22 seems to be more promising to observe the lepton flavor violation in the model ( 2 ) with the bare mass term , if the ordinary - exotic lepton couplings @xmath56 are comparable each other .",
    "the possible contributions of the @xmath127 coupling to the flavor violation in the quark sector are estimated in this model ( 2 ) as follows .",
    "we have here the significant left - handed squark mixings such as @xmath270 , which is the same as the left - handed slepton mixings given in eq.([50 ] ) .",
    "then , a constraint @xmath271 is placed from the @xmath23-@xmath24 system @xcite .",
    "this constraint is , however , less stringent than that from the @xmath22 .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the lepton flavor violating processes , especially the @xmath2 decay , which are obtained from the mixing between the ordinary leptons and the vectorlike leptons .",
    "although the lepton fcnc s appear at the tree level , their effects are small naturally because of the hierarchy of the charged lepton masses .",
    "hence , the fine tuning of parameters is not necessary to suppress the fcnc s sufficiently . in the supersymmetric model , significant effects of lepton flavor violation",
    "are obtained from the slepton mixing which is generated by radiative corrections with the ordinary - exotic lepton couplings . in the model ( 1 ) without the bare mass term of the vectorlike lepton doublets , the supersymmetric contributions to the @xmath2 decay are rather suppressed by @xmath160 as well as @xmath161 due to the approximate @xmath3 symmetry , which is similar to the gauge boson mediated contributions .",
    "it is , however , remarkable that these supersymmetric contributions to @xmath5 are substantially enhanced by the factor @xmath4 compared to the gauge boson mediated contributions .",
    "then , if @xmath6 is larger than 20 , @xmath5 might be comparable to the present experimental bound . in the model ( 2 ) with the bare mass term , much larger contributions to @xmath5 are obtained through the slepton mixing . in either case",
    "we have shown that the slepton mixing contributions to the @xmath2 decay can be large enough to be observed in the near future experiments .",
    "it should also be noted that in the model ( 1 ) the @xmath272 decay may be more promising as seen in eq.([48 ] ) .",
    "the discovery of @xmath2 clearly indicates the new physics .",
    "the supersymmetric contributions to the @xmath2 decay have been considered so far in the literature for other supersymmetric models such as the susy gut @xcite and the mssm with right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the predictions of br(@xmath2 ) in these models are within reach of the future experiments . these are , however , the effects of ultra high energy physics much above the electroweak scale . in the supersymmetric model with vectorlike leptons , which may be motivated by the @xmath1 type unification",
    ", the significant contributions to the @xmath2 decay can be obtained due to the exotic leptons and their scalar partners which exist just around the electroweak scale .",
    "therefore , the direct experimental search is feasible for these new particles @xcite .",
    "it is also observed in the model ( 2 ) with the bare mass term of vectorlike leptons that even if the soft supersymmetry breaking scale is around @xmath273 , br(@xmath2 ) can be comparable to the current experimental bound with relatively large ordinary - exotic lepton couplings . these features are salient to the supersymmetric model with vectorlike leptons in contrast to the other supersymmetric models .",
