    "each galaxy has its own peculiarities . nevertheless , even to the untrained eye ,",
    "sufficiently well - resolved galaxies can be separated into three morphological types : disky spirals , bulgy ellipticals , and others which are neither .",
    "the morphological classification of galaxies is a field that is nearly one hundred years old , and sample sizes of a few thousand morphologically classified galaxies are now available ( e.g. fukugita et al .",
    "2007 ; lintott et al . 2008 )",
    ". however , such eyeball classifications are prohibitively expensive in the era of large scale sky surveys , which image upwards of a few million galaxies .",
    "moreover , the morphological classification of even relatively low redshift objects from ground - based data is difficult .",
    "thus , a number of groups have devised automated algorithms for discerning morphologies from such data ( e.g. ball et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .    in parallel",
    ", it has been recognized that relatively simple criteria , using either crude measures of the light profile ( e.g. strateva et al . 2001 ) , the colors ( e.g. baldry et al . 2004 ) , or some combination of photometric and spectroscopic information ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ; bernardi & hyde 2009 ) allow one to separate early - type galaxies from the rest . because they are so simple , these tend to be more widely used .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show how samples based on such crude cuts compare with those which are based on the eyeball morphological classifications of fukugita et al .",
    "we do so by comparing the luminosity , stellar mass , size and velocity dispersion distributions for cuts based on photometric parameters with those based on morphology .",
    "these were chosen because the luminosity function is standard , although it is becoming increasingly common to compare models with @xmath14 rather than @xmath15 ( e.g. cole et al .",
    "2001 ; bell et al . 2003 ; panter et al . 2007 ; li & white 2009 ) ;",
    "the size distribution @xmath16 has also begun to receive considerable attention recently ( shankar et al . 2009b ) ; and the distribution of velocity dispersions @xmath17 ( sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) is useful , amongst other things , to reconstruct the mass distribution of super - massive black holes ( e.g. shankar et al .",
    "2004 ; tundo et al .",
    "2007 ; bernardi et al . 2007",
    "; shankar , weinberg & miralda - escud 2009 ; shankar et al .",
    "2009a ) and in studies of gravitational lensing ( mitchell et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "section  [ data ] describes the dataset , the photometric and spectroscopic parameters derived from it , and the subsample defined by fukugita et al .",
    "this section shows how we use quantities output from the sdss database to define seeing - corrected half - light radii which closely approximate the result of bulge + disk decompositions .",
    "we describe our stellar mass estimator in this section as well ; a detailed comparison of it with stellar mass estimates computed by three different groups is presented in appendix  [ mscomp ] .",
    "the result of classifying objects into two classes , on the basis of color , concentration index , or morphology are compared in section  [ sec : mcba ] .",
    "luminosity , stellar mass , size and velocity dispersion distributions , for the fukugita et al .",
    "morphological types are presented in section  [ dfs ] , where they are compared with those based on the other simpler selection cuts .",
    "this section includes a discussion of the functional form , a generalization of the schechter function , which we use to fit our measurements .",
    "we find more objects with large stellar masses than in previous work ( e.g. cole et al .",
    "2001 ; bell et al . 2003 ; panter et al . 2007 ; li & white 2009 ) ;",
    "this is the subject of section  [ phimass ] , where implications for the match with the integrated star formation rate , and the question of how the most massive galaxies have evolved since @xmath18 are discussed .",
    "while we believe these distributions to be interesting in their own right , we also study a specific example in which correlations between quantities , rather than the distributions themselves , depend on morphology .",
    "this is the correlation between the half - light radius of a galaxy and the luminosity weighted age of its stellar population .",
    "section  [ agere ] shows that the morphological dependence of this relation means it is sensitive to how the ` early - type ' sample was selected , potentially resolving a discrepancy in the recent literature ( shankar & bernardi 2009 ; van der wel et al .",
    "2009 ; shankar et al .",
    "a final section summarizes our results , many of which are provided in tabular form in appendix  [ tables ] .    except when stated otherwise , we assume a spatially flat background cosmology dominated by a cosmological constant , with parameters @xmath19 , and a hubble constant at the present time of @xmath20  km  s@xmath21mpc@xmath21 .",
    "when we assume a different value for @xmath22 , we write it as @xmath23  km  s@xmath21mpc@xmath21 .",
    "in what follows , we will study the luminosities , sizes , velocity dispersions and stellar masses of a magnitude limited sample of @xmath24 sdss galaxies with @xmath25 in the @xmath26band , selected from 4681 deg@xmath27 of sky . in this band ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of the sun is @xmath28 .",
    "the sdss provides a variety of measures of the light profile of a galaxy . of these the petrosian magnitudes and sizes",
    "are the most commonly used , because they do not depend on fits to models . however , for some of what is to follow , the petrosian magnitude is not ideal , since it captures a type - dependent fraction of the total light of a galaxy .",
    "in addition , seeing compromises use of the petrosian sizes for almost all the distant lower luminosity objects , leading to systematic biases ( see hyde & bernardi 2009 for examples ) .",
    "before we discuss the alternatives , we note that there is one petrosian based quantity which will play an important role in what follows .",
    "this is the concentration index @xmath0 , which is the ratio of the scale which contains 90% of the petrosian light in the @xmath1-band , to that which contains 50% .",
    "early - type galaxies , which are more centrally concentrated , are expected to have larger values of @xmath0 , and two values are in common use : a more conservative @xmath0@xmath29 ( e.g. nakamura et al .",
    "2003 ; shen et al .",
    "2003 ) and a more cavalier @xmath0@xmath30 ( e.g. strateva et al . 2001 ; kauffmann et al . 2003 ; bell et al .",
    "we show below that from the first approximately two - thirds of the sample comes from e+s0 types , whereas the second selects a mix in which e+s0+sa s account for about two - thirds of the objects .",
    "the sdss also outputs dev or exp magnitudes and sizes which result from fitting to a devaucouleur or exponential profile , and fracdev , a quantity which takes values between 0 and 1 , which is a measure of how well the devaucouleur profile actually fit the profile ( 1 being an excellent fit ) .",
    "in addition , it outputs cmodel magnitudes ; this is a very crude disk+bulge magnitude which has been seeing - corrected . rather than resulting from the best - fitting linear combination of an exponential disk and a devaucouleur bulge ,",
    "the cmodel magnitude comes from separately fitting exponential and devaucouleur profiles to the image , and then combining these fits by finding that linear combination of them which best - fits the image .",
    "thus , if @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the magnitudes returned by fitting the two models , then @xmath33 later in this paper , we will be interested in seeing - corrected half - light radii .",
    "we use the cmodel fits to define these sizes by finding that scale @xmath34 where @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the surface brightness associated with the two fits .",
    "note that the sdss actually performs a two dimensional fit to the image , and it outputs the half - light radius of the long axis of the image a , and the axis ratio b / a .",
    "the expression above assumes one dimensional profiles , so we use the half - light radius a of the exponential fit , and @xmath37 for the devaucouleur fit .",
    "we describe some tests of these cmodel quantities shortly .",
    "we would also like to study the velocity dispersions of these objects .",
    "one of the important differences between the sdss - dr6 and previous releases is that the low velocity dispersions ( @xmath38  km  s@xmath21 ) were biased high ; this has been corrected in the dr6 release ( see dr6 documentation , or discussion in bernardi 2007 ) .",
    "the sdss - dr6 only reports velocity dispersions if the @xmath39 in the spectrum in the restframe @xmath40    is larger than 10 or with the status flag equal to 4 ( i.e. this tends to exclude galaxies with emission lines ) . to avoid introducing a bias from these cuts , we have also estimated velocity dispersions for all the remaining objects ( see hyde & bernardi 2009 for more discussion ) .",
    "these velocity dispersions are based on spectra measured through a fiber of radius 1.5  arcsec ; they are then corrected to @xmath41 , as is standard practice .",
    "( this is a small correction . )",
    "the velocity dispersion estimate for emission line galaxies can be compromised by rotation .",
    "in addition , the dispersion limit of the sdss spectrograph is @xmath42  km  s@xmath21 , so at small @xmath43 the estimated velocity dispersion may both noisy and biased .",
    "we will see later that this affects the velocity dispersion function .",
    "the size and velocity dispersion can be combined to estimate a dynamical mass ; we do this by setting @xmath44 .",
    "recently , fukugita et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have provided morphological classifications ( hubble type t ) for a subset of 2253 sdss galaxies brighter than @xmath45 in the @xmath26band , selected from 230 deg@xmath27 of sky . of these , 1866 have spectroscopic information . since our goal is to compare these morphological selected subsamples with those selected based on relatively simple criteria ( e.g. concentration index ) , we group galaxies classified with half - integer t into the smaller adjoining integer bin ( except for the e class ; see also huang & gu 2009 and oohama et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the following , we set e ( t = 0 and 0.5 ) , s0 ( t = 1 ) , sa ( t = 1.5 and 2 ) , sb ( t = 2.5 and 3 ) , and scd ( t = 3.5 , 4 , 4.5 , 5 , and 5.5 ) .",
    "this gives a fractional morphological mix of ( e , s0 , sa , sb , scd ) = ( 0.269 , 0.235 , 0.177 , 0.19 , 0.098 ) . note that this is the mix in a magnitude limited catalog  meaning that brighter galaxies ( typically earlier - types ) are over - represented .      as a check of our cmodel sizes",
    ", we have performed devaucouleurs bulge + exponential disk fits to light profiles of a subset of the objects ; see hyde & bernardi ( 2009 ) for a detailed description and tests of the fitting procedure .",
    "if we view these as the correct answer , then the top left panel of figure  [ cmodel ] shows that the cmodel magnitudes are in good agreement with those from the full bulge+disk fit , except at fracdev@xmath46 and fracdev@xmath47 where cmodel is fainter by 0.05  mags ( top left ) .",
    "this is precisely the regime where the agreement should have been best .",
    "as discussed shortly , the discrepancy arises mainly because the sdss reductions suffer from sky subtraction problems ( see , e.g. , sdss dr7 documentation ) , whereas our bulge - disk fits do not ( see hyde & bernardi 2009 for details ) .",
    "comparison with the top right panel shows that cmodel is a significant improvement on either the dev or the exp magnitudes alone ."
