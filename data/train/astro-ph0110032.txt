    "our sample of @xmath0 clusters of galaxies is part of the rosat distant cluster survey ( rdcs ; rosati _ et al .",
    "the rdcs contains 137 clusters of galaxies covering 50 deg@xmath1 to an x - ray flux limit of @xmath2 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "this includes the highest redshift , x - ray selected clusters galaxies known to date , with ten clusters at @xmath3 .",
    "the luminosity and redshift distribution of our high redshift sample is plotted in figure 1 , along with that distribution for the bright sharc sample ( romer _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) and the einstein medium sensitivity sample of clusters of galaxies ( henry _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; gioia & luppino 1995 ) for comparison .",
    "we have targeted this sample for follow - up with the two premier x - ray observatories , chandra and xmm - newton . to date , we have chandra observations for four clusters in that sample , with the details listed in table 1 .",
    "the x - ray data for two of the clusters discussed here , rx j0848 + 4453 and rx j0849 + 4452 , are presented in stanford _",
    "for the rest of this work we will assume @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    ".summary of chandra observations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     two things are striking .",
    "first , two of the models are quite round .",
    "the deviations from a circular model are at less than 5% for both .",
    "this is in contrast with , say , ms 1054 - 0321 or rx j0152.7 - 1357 , which show greatly disturbed , asymmetric morphologies .",
    "second , for these round clusters , the best fitting core radii and values of @xmath7 are normal for low redshift clusters of galaxies .",
    "these two clusters are also have the largest number of net counts . for rx j0910 + 5429 , in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band we measured a total of 500 counts , including the background , within two core radii .",
    "we expected 137.4 counts from the background in the same bandpass . with rx j0849 + 4452 , we found 469 counts in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band within two core radii while expecting 142.8 from the background .",
    "in contrast , rx j0848 + 4453 has only 259 counts with 104.6 background counts expected and rx j1317 + 2911 has 217 events with 54.7 expected .",
    "therefore , we may only be resolving the cores of these systems , and missing a smooth outer region because of the lack of events .",
    "nonetheless , both have strange morphologies not well described with a @xmath7 model . because of the poorer statistics and the strange morphologies for these clusters , we quote no error bars on our measured parameters for the @xmath7 model .",
    "rx j0848 + 4453 is also strongly contaminated by point sources , see figure 2 .",
    "two of these point sources are potential cluster members , based on photometric redshifts , and are likely to be active galactic nuclei based on their hardness ratios . after excluding these sources , the flux we measured for rx j0848 + 4453 was significantly lower than what we measured in the original rdcs .",
    "for the two clusters with well constrained morphologies , rx j0849 + 4452 and rx j0910 + 5429 , we used an aperture of twice the core radius to measure the temperature and flux .",
    "we than use the best fitting @xmath7 model to compute the total flux . in table 1",
    ", we quote the best fitting temperatures and luminosities .",
    "for the two remaining clusters , we used a curve of growth analysis to pick a total flux aperture .",
    "we used that aperture to measure the temperature as well .",
    "these results are also included in table 1 .",
    "we plot , in figure 3 , the luminosities and temperatures for our data and a number of other high redshift clusters . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the relation for low redshift clusters of galaxies as measured by markevitch ( 1998 ) and the low redshift group data of helsdon & ponman ( 2000 ) .",
    "when our data are combined with the other high redshift clusters of galaxies , it appears that there is minimal or no evolution in the luminosity - temperature relation .",
    "= 0.7    as a rough test for evolution , we fit the relation @xmath8 to the high redshift data , including the four clusters in our sample , the two @xmath0 clusters ( rx j1716.6 + 6708 , and rx j0152.7 - 1357 ) from della ceca et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , three clusters ( ms1137.5 + 6625 , 1wgaj1226.9 , & cdfs - cl1 ) summarized in borgani et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the results for ms1054.4 - 0321 from jeltema _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) ( see also these proceedings ) .",
    "we fit the relation using the method of akritas and bershady ( 1996 ) which accounts for errors in both the temperature and luminosity . for our sample of ten clusters and groups",
    ", we found the best fit slope to be @xmath9 ( 90% confidence limits ) at our median redshift of @xmath10 .",
    "our measured slope differs by slightly more than one standard deviation from @xmath11 ( 90% confidence limits ) , the relation of markevitch ( 1998 ) .",
    "our result is in good agreement with the slope of @xmath12 from allen & fabian ( 1998 ) .",
    "we note here that we fit only isothermal models to all of the clusters in our sample .",
    "therefore , we compare our results with the model a from allen & fabian ( 1998 ) , which used similar assumptions .",
    "in figure 4 , we plot a color magnitude diagram for the 4 clusters in our sample . we have shifted the colors and magnitudes to the median redshift for our sample of 1.18 .",
    "we circle in x - ray point sources that are within one standard deviation of the mean color - magnitude relation and within 2  of the cluster center .",
    "so , each of these galaxies are possible cluster members and they appear to have x - ray emission .",
    "the number of these objects in entirely consistent with the results of barger et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who find 4% of @xmath13 or bright galaxies are x - ray emitters and 7% of their entire sample . as the potential sources of the x - ray emission are active galactic nuclei or a very hot interstellar medium , these objects could be important sources of entropy for the intracluster medium ( icm ) , e.g. , bower ( 1997 ) or ponman , cannon & navarro ( 1999 ) . in figure 5",
    ", we show a hard x - ray image of rx j0910 + 5429 along with the same soft image shown in figure 2 .",
    "there is an obvious hard excesses to the south of the core of the cluster .",
    "the hard excess is statistically significant at the 99% confidence limit when compared with both the central region of the cluster ( within an equal area centered slightly to the north of the centroid ) and when compared with the background .",
    "one explanation is we are observing a merger event and the resulting shock .",
    "another is the circled x - ray source in the southeast of the cluster , one of the candidates in figure 4 , is heating the icm .    therefore , if we understand these hard x - ray sources and , most importantly , learn how much energy and over what range redshifts they are adding to the icm , we can directly test the idea of agn heating of the icm ( see valageas & silk 1999 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 ) and answer the question of the origin of the icm pre - heating .",
    "we have observed with the chandra telescope four clusters of galaxies in our sample of ten at @xmath0 .",
    "two of these four are relaxed looking clusters with values for @xmath7 and the core radius entirely consistent with low redshift clusters .",
    "the other two , however , have elongated morphologies and , in one case , an extreme value for @xmath7 and the core radius .    despite the wide range of morphologies ,",
    "all of our clusters agree with the low redshift luminosity temperature relation . including other results",
    ", we can see that the l - t relation has little evolution over almost one order of magnitude in temperature out to a @xmath14 .",
    "finally , we identify a potential source of cluster members for the additional entropy needed to explain the l - t relation .",
    "further investigation into these objects could shed light on the origin and evolution of the intracluster medium ."
