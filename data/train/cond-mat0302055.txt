    "in the last ten years physicists have been interested again in the study of dry granular materials .",
    "granular materials are ubiquitous around us .",
    "they have many properties that are greatly different from those associated with common solids , liquids and gases .",
    "these unique properties lead to many applications .",
    "many new ideas have emerged from this recent development .",
    "these systems have been studied from various different viewpoints experimentally , numerically , and theoretically@xcite .",
    "nesterenko@xcitenoted that the propagation of a perturbation in loaded chain with hertzian contacts possesses soliton - like features .",
    "the soliton - like behavior of the signal in two - dimensional granular beds was studied by sinkovits and sen@xcite .",
    "the soliton - like properties of the signal in the chain of iron balls were examined experimentally by coste et al@xcite .",
    "sen et al @xcite studied the soliton - like pulse in perturbed and driven hertzian chains and their possible applications in detecting buried impurities . for the vertical granular chain under gravity with power - law - type contact force ,",
    "j. hong et al @xcite showed that there are two kinds of propagating modes , quasisolitary and oscillatory , depending on the strength of impulse .",
    "the type of dispersion and the oscillation frequency , wavelength , and period follow power laws in depth ; j. hong and aiguo xu@xcite found that the signal speed follows a power law in depth and the exponent varies smoothly from a saturant value to zero when the strength of the perturbation varies from very weak to very strong .    to explore the prospects for the application of impulse for detecting certain buried objects in granular beds , it is imperative that one must acquire a detailed understanding of the its properties . up to now many problems on this topics are still openning .",
    "in present paper , we study the scattering process of impulse when it encounters some other kind of grains which we name impurities .",
    "the granular chain system can be described by the following motion equations    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the mass of the @xmath3th grain , @xmath4 is the inter - grain interaction between the @xmath3th and the@xmath5th grains . in this paper",
    "we study the impulses in a special case with @xmath6[\\delta _ 0-(x_n - x_{n-1})]^{p+1}$ ] , where @xmath7 is the diameter of the spherical grain , @xmath8 the exponent of the power - law type contact force , and @xmath9 the elastic constant of the grain under consideration .",

    "in our system most of the grains are same and the second kind of grains only occur as impurities . hence",
    "to analytically get some information of the system , we first fix the mass of all the grains to a constant , i.e. , @xmath12 for all @xmath3 . then we introduce a new variable @xmath13 , denoting the displacement of @xmath3th grain from equilibrium , defined by @xmath14 where the last term in the right - hand side is the sum of grain overlaps up to @xmath3th contact and we set @xmath15 .",

    "we drop weak nonlinear terms of the expansion in eq .",

    "thus the vertical granular chain becomes a horizontal chain with varying force constants in which the gravity effect is contained . both left and right side of eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) are linear in @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the scaling analysis tells us that the equation of motion ( [ linear ] ) has nothing to do with the initial impulse @xmath0 . for this case",
    "we@xcite have obtained the following power - law , @xmath20 the reducing of signal amplitude mainly due to the dispersion effect .    in our present studies",
    "two distances are important .",
    "the first one is the depth of the impurities @xmath21 .",
    "the second one is the distance between the impurity center and the grain where we get datas , @xmath22 .",
    "our main objectives are to get some knowledge on the reflection rate and transmission rate of the kinetic energy from the impurities . for fixed @xmath22",
    ", we expect the reflection rate follows a power - law and the exponent is independent of @xmath0 .    for the strongly nonlinear regime , the condition @xmath23 is valid and the expansion under this condition leads eq .",

    "the signal speed is a constant , so the exponent of the depth - dependence is @xmath29 .",
    "our results are based on careful numerical integration of the coupled equations of motion for granular chains with @xmath30 spheres , where @xmath30 varies from @xmath31 to @xmath32 according to our need .",
    "the predictor - corrector method , runge - kutta method , richardson extrapolation and the bulirsch - stoer method@xcite are used .",
    "the program units are just the same as those in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "that is to say , the units of distance , mass , and time are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "this kind of program units gives the gravitational acceleration @xmath36 .",
    "we set the grain diameter @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "figure 1 shows four snapshots for a scattering process , where the impurity depth is @xmath39 , which is described by the grain number ; there are five impurities around the depth @xmath39 ; the mass of the impurity grain is @xmath40 ; the initial perturbation strength is @xmath41 .",

    ". the leading and second leading peaks of the scattered impulse are pointed by an arrow , respectively , in figs . 1 ( c ) and 1 ( d ) .",
    "it is clear that the leading peak of the scattering impulse is upwards , which is a characteristic property of the scattering process from light impurities@xcite .",
    "we use five impurities because that the scattered impulse is too weak if we use only one impurity . to understand the scattering process , we are interested in the variation of the ratios @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44with the depth of the impurities @xmath21 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are maximum values of the leading peaks of the incident and reflected impulses , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are maximum values of the second leading peaks of the incident and reflected impulses .",
    "we obtain these datas from a gain with depth @xmath49 .",
    "the three ratios describe the reflection rate from different sides . during the scattering process",
    "the shape of the impulse is not stable , so an appropriate distance @xmath22 is necessary .",
    "these ratios describe the reflection rate of the kinetic energy in the vertical granular chain . in order to get exact value for the leading and second leading peaks , we use the smooth velocity - time curve of the measured gain , instead of the rough snapshots .",
    "fig.2 shows the variations of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 with the impurity depth @xmath21 .",
    "2 ( a ) is for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",

    "fig.2 ( b ) is for @xmath56 , where @xmath52 , @xmath57 .",
    "the solid squares are for numerical results and the line is the fitting curve .",
    "we use the simplest power - law model , @xmath58 , to fit the numerical results .",
    "the fitting results suggest that the three ratios follow power - laws when @xmath21 is large enough . from refs . @xcite",
    "we know that when the initial perturbation is weak the propagating mode is oscillatory , when the initial perturbation is strong the propagating mode is quasisolitary .",
    "it is interesting to check if the power - law model works for both the weak and strong perturbations .",
    "if it works , we have the following expected result : when @xmath0 is large enough , the behavior of the vertical chain is similar to that of the horizontal chain ; hence there is no power - law .",
    "that means @xmath59 as @xmath27 .",
    "fig.3 shows the variation of the exponent for @xmath60 with the strength of initial perturbation , where the line with squares is for the case of @xmath61 , the line with circles is for the case of @xmath52 .",
    "the two curves show similar behaviors .",
    "it is clear that the exponent is independent of @xmath0 when @xmath0 is very small . for the case of @xmath61 , @xmath62 . for the case of @xmath52 , @xmath63 .",
    "in fact when @xmath0 is too small we can hardly get helpful information from the simulation datas due to numerical errors .",
    "the curve for @xmath61 has a peak around @xmath64 .",
    "the curve for @xmath52 has a peak around @xmath65 .",
    "when @xmath66 , @xmath67 decreases quickly with the increasing of @xmath0 .",
    "we tried to add more points to the figure , but when @xmath68 is larger than @xmath69 we can hardly measure the second leading peak from the incident impulse .",
    "we can know the reason from fig .",
    "4 .    fig .",
    "4 shows a @xmath70 relation , where @xmath71 , @xmath52 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the impulse near @xmath74 is the incident one .",
    "the impulse within @xmath75 is the reflected one ( only part of the reflected impulse is plotted ) .",
    "it is clear that for a strong perturbation the propagating impulse is quasisolitary and it has no evident the second leading peak ; at the same time , the leading peak of the reflected impulse is very small and there exist some oscillations before the leading peak occurs .",
    "when the perturbation is weak , the propagation of the wave is oscillatory ; hence the two ratios @xmath42 and @xmath43 can describe well the reflection rate of the kinetic energy from the impurities .",
    "but with the increasing of @xmath0 , the propagation of the wave is more and more quasisolitary and the ratio @xmath76 describes the reflection rate better .",
    "fig.5 shows the variation of the exponent @xmath77 for @xmath56 with @xmath0 , where @xmath52 .",
    "it shows similar behavior to the exponent @xmath67 for @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath0 is very small , @xmath78 .",
    "although we have found the power - law behavior for @xmath50 for not very large @xmath0 ( see fig . 2 for an example ) , it is hard for us to get a figure which is similar to fig.3 and fig.5 .",
    "the reasons will be given in the following part .",
    "for a fixed distance @xmath22 , when the depth of impurities @xmath21 is large , we find the curve @xmath54 oscillates greatly with @xmath21 .",
    "6 shows two examples , where @xmath52 ; @xmath79 in ( a ) and @xmath80 in ( b ) .",
    "we can understand the reason for this kind of behaviors through fig . 7 .",
    "fig.7 shows several @xmath70 curves from which we can study the scattering process of the impulse , where @xmath81 , @xmath41 , @xmath82 ; @xmath83 in ( a ) , @xmath84 in ( b ) , @xmath85 in ( c ) , and @xmath86 in ( d ) , respectively .",
    "for the reflected impulse , only the leading peak and the second peak are shown . for a fixed value of @xmath22 , when the depth @xmath21 is small ,",
    "the reflected impulse and the incident impulse are separated , i.e. there is a time during which the measured grain is static . for these cases",
    ", we can get exact values for @xmath45 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath48 . when the depth @xmath89 is large enough ,",
    "the tail of the incident impulse and the reflected impulse are connected . for these cases , we can hardly get exact values for @xmath46 and @xmath48 . from fig.7",
    "we also understand the fact these phenomena first influence the measurement of @xmath87 , then @xmath48 .",
    "we name the increasing process of @xmath21 before a power - law occurs a transient process .",
    "the simulation results show that the ratio @xmath50 needs a much longer transient process than @xmath55 .",
    "the initial impulse is stronger , we need a longer transient process . the curves for @xmath51 decreases with the increasing of @xmath90 , while the curves for @xmath54 first increases , then decreases .",
    "the initial impulse is stronger , the curves decrease more slowly .",
    "we also notice that there are more fitting errors when @xmath0 is large .",
    "in present paper we study the scattering process of impulse in vertical granular chain with light impurities .",
    "most of the studies resort on numerical simulations and the analytic treatment helps to understand the behaviors . when the perturbation is weak , the quantities describing the reflection rate exhibit power law behavior with the impuity depth .",
    "the exponent is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "when the perturbation is very strong , the vertical chain shows similar behavior to that of the horizontal chain , so the exponent is zero .",
    "our numerical investigation begins from the weak perturbation region and extend to the nonlinear region and found a peak of the exponent .",
