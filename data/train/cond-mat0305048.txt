    "magnesium diboride mgb@xmath0 is a binary inter - metallic compound @xcite with a simple , layered structure : boron atoms form a honeycomb lattice with hexagonal magnesium layers sandwiched between the b layers ( see fig .",
    "[ struc ] ) .",
    "the material has been known since the 1950 s @xcite , but little attention was paid to this compound .",
    "this changed dramatically in january 2001 , when it was reported that mgb@xmath0 becomes superconducting below @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "particularly the high transition temperature caused a lot of interest in this compound and it s physical properties .",
    "just ten months after the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , a comprehensive review @xcite appeared , covering the first months of research about this `` new '' superconductor .",
    "the review counted 263 studies that between january and july either appeared in journals or were available to the community as e - prints .",
    "the initial excitement was driven by the high transition temperature , thought to be close to the limit of what can be expected for a material exhibiting superconductivity with a conventional , phonon mediated pairing mechanism @xcite .",
    "the high @xmath10 of mgb@xmath0 therefore immediately raised speculations about an unconventional pairing mechanism .",
    "however , studies of the boron isotope effect on @xmath5 @xcite and , e.g. , the @xmath11b nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xcite soon indicated a bcs type s - wave phonon - mediated mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "the rather conventional nature of the superconducting pairing in mgb@xmath0 is also evidenced by the absence of a boron isotope effect on the penetration depth @xcite , in contrast to observations on cuprate superconductors @xcite .    on the other",
    ", mgb@xmath0 is far from being just an `` all ordinary '' conventional superconductor well described by bcs theory , as many other experiments showed .",
    "point contact spectroscopy @xcite indicated , for example , an energy gap to @xmath10 ratio much lower than predicted by bcs theory , the results of specific heat measurements @xcite were also at odds with bcs predictions , and the total ( mg and b ) isotope effect on @xmath5 was found to be substantially lower than expected as well @xcite .",
    "the huge difference between the effects of boron and magnesium isotope substitution @xcite provided an early clue for a highly selective electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) , and the specific heat measurements @xcite even indicated the existence of a second superconducting gap .",
    "calculations of the band - structure and electron - phonon interaction led to the description of mgb@xmath0 as a peculiar `` two band '' superconductor @xcite , whose features show up in almost every conceivable measurement @xcite .    the chapter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ twoband ] , the concept and origin of two band superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 are sketched , as well as its experimental confirmation .",
    "one of the features heavily influenced by the two band nature of superconductivity is the angular and temperature dependence of the upper critical field @xmath3 , related to the coherence length . in sec .",
    "[ hc2 ] , torque measurements of @xmath12 are presented and discussed . section [ hc2 ] also contains a brief discussion of anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory and basic experimental procedures ( see angst @xcite for a more comprehensive discussion ) .",
    "the question of how exactly two band superconductivity shapes the anisotropy of the basic length scales below the ( bulk ) @xmath3 , is still not completely solved . in sec.[mixedstate ] , we review torque ( and selected other ) measurements in the mixed state and compare to recent theoretical concepts and predictions . apart from two band superconductivity , mgb@xmath0 is also interesting in that thermal fluctuations of vortices in this superconductor are of a strength intermediate between the ones of the cuprate and of conventional superconductors . in sec .",
    "[ pe ] , we present and discuss the vortex matter phase diagram , drawn based on torque measurements . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conc ] , we summarize our discussion and present the main conclusions .    .",
    "the structure consists of alternating layers of magnesium ( large spheres ) and boron ( small spheres ) atoms .",
    "figure from ref.@xcite , @xmath13 copyright nature publishing group . ]",
    "a two band scenario leading to two superconducting gaps was already proposed just two years after formulation of the bcs theory @xcite .",
    "two different bands in which superconductivity can exist are the most essential ingredient . without any scattering of electrons by phonons from one band to the other one , there would be two transition temperatures . in the case of weak , but finite , interband phonon scattering , the lower @xmath10 disappears and the temperature dependence of the lower gap becomes strongly non - bcs . with very large phonon interband scattering , there should be still two gaps with temperature dependences now roughly similar to bcs predictions .",
    "the initial two - gap proposal was made in view of applications to @xmath14 metals .",
    "however , while some hints of `` two - gap effects '' were experimentally thought to be detected in form of small deviations from bcs in transitions metals @xcite , no strong effects , unequivocally attributable to two superconducting gaps , were found .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that , in order to observe considerable two - band effects , it was not enough to have two overlapping bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "an additional requirement was that the bands in question have very different physical origins , such as covalent vs metallic - type bonding , which is more likely to occur in compounds .",
    "the most convincing historical demonstration of two - gap superconductivity was made by tunnelling experiments in nb doped srtio@xmath15 @xcite , where clear double peaks in the tunnelling conductance were found .",
    "two- or multi- band models were also proposed for the cuprate h@xmath10sc ( see , e.g. , kresin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , but strong electron - electron correlations and magnetism make those materials quite difficult to tract with first principles calculations @xcite , and unequivocal experimental evidence for any observable effects being due to multi band effects is scarce .",
    "it was only after the discovery of superconductivity in magnesium diboride that strong two - band effects were seen by a large number of different experimental techniques .",
    "what is it that really makes mgb@xmath0 so special ?    answering this question was helped tremendously by the fact that the relatively simple crystal structure ( see fig .  [ struc ] ) and the lack of complications arising from spin - dependent interactions or strong electron - electron correlations made accurate _ ab initio _ calculations of the electronic structure @xcite and of the lattice dynamics @xcite possible . in the remainder of the section we briefly sketch this answer , about which by now a general consensus developed .",
    "magnesium atoms in mgb@xmath0 are effectively ionized @xcite , i.e. , they serve mainly as electron donors , similar to electron doping of graphite by intercalation . like carbon atoms in graphite ,",
    "boron atoms are sp@xmath16 hybridized , with three of the four @xcite valence electrons tied up in strong covalent @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) bonds lying in plane , while the fourth electron is in nonbonding @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) states , which are delocalized ( like the @xmath19 bonds in benzene ) .",
    "apart from doping the boron sublattice with electrons , mg atoms , respectively mg@xmath21 ions , have another crucial impact on the electronic structure of mgb@xmath0 : since the mg@xmath21 attractive potential is felt more strongly by the electrons in the @xmath19 states than by the ones in the @xmath17 states , magnesium induces charge transfer from the @xmath17 to the @xmath19 states , accompanied by the corresponding relative shift of the @xmath17 and @xmath19 band energies .    ,",
    "consisting of four separate sheets : the tubular networks in the center of the figure are the two @xmath19 sheets , the two @xmath22 centered ( approximate ) cylinders the @xmath17 sheets ( see text ) .",
    "the coloring / shading indicates the wave vector dependent energy gap of mgb@xmath0 without any impurity scattering at @xmath23 , with the coding and the distribution of gap values given besides the main figure .",
    "on the nearly - cylindrical @xmath17 sheets , the gap value is @xmath24 , while on the 3d @xmath19 sheets it is @xmath25 .",
    "figure from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath13 copyright nature publishing group . ]",
    "this leads the @xmath17 bands of mgb@xmath0 to be incompletely filled , in contrast to graphite .",
    "the covalent @xmath17 bonds are `` driven metallic '' , i.e. the corresponding carriers become mobile , by mg induced charge transfer . the calculated fermi surface ( fs ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fs ] , consists of four separate sheets .",
    "two sheets , derived from the boron @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) bands , are ( electronlike and holelike ) tubular networks . since the smaller b@xmath26b in plane distance is compensated by a smaller ( @xmath27 vs @xmath28 ) hopping @xcite , they are virtually isotropic and clearly three - dimensional ( 3d ) . the other two sheets , derived from boron @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) bands are holelike ( approximate ) cylinders with axis @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath17 sheets show very little dispersion along @xmath30 and are thus nearly two - dimensional ( 2d ) , which could be expected from the covalent directed nature of the associated intraplanar b@xmath26b bonds . correspondingly , a high anisotropy of the fermi velocity , averaged over the @xmath17 sheets , was calculated @xcite : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the average over the @xmath17 fermi sheets .",
    "the quasi two - dimensionality of the @xmath17 bands also leads to a sizeable contribution to the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level @xmath26 despite the very small hole doping level @xcite .",
    "in fact , the contributions of the 2d @xmath17 bands to the total dos at the fs is almost equal in size to the one of the 3d @xmath19 bands ( 44% vs 56% @xcite ) .",
    "this feature of two sets of bands with different dimensionality , but comparable contribution to the dos at the fermi level , is very peculiar",
    ".    for phonon mediated superconductivity , the phonon `` band structure '' and the epc are just as important as the details of the structure of the electronic subsystem .",
    "the layered structure of mgb@xmath0 is reflected in the phonon dispersion curves as well , by weak dispersion of the optical branches along @xmath33 , and by anisotropic acoustic branches .",
    "of the four distinct branches with non zero energy at the zone center @xmath22 , three were found to have no sizeable coupling to the electronic subsystem .",
    "this is not the case , however , for the doubly degenerate mode with @xmath34 symmetry at @xmath22 , which involves only in - plane ( hexagon distorting ) movement of boron atoms and is strongly anharmonic @xcite : this movement leads to large variations in the overlap of orbitals of neighboring b atoms , obviously modulating bond energies , particularly of the covalent @xmath17 bonds .",
    "detailed zone - center frozen phonon calculations @xcite indeed find a coupling of the @xmath34 phonon mode to the @xmath17 bands , which is not only very large , but also strongly non - linear , suggesting even pairing via two - phonon exchange @xcite .",
    "this anomalously large coupling is evidenced , for example , by an extremely large linewidth of the @xmath34 mode @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the large and nonlinear coupling , the anharmonicity , as well as the small carrier density in the @xmath17 bands @xcite are intimately related and have competing effects on @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "with such an anisotropic ( sheet@xmath26 or , more general , @xmath35dependent ) epc , the superconducting pairing ( and order parameter , gap ) should be anisotropic as well , at least in the clean limit .",
    "an analysis of pairing , decomposed into the four fermi sheet contributions , led liu _",
    "@xcite to propose the two - gap scenario for mgb@xmath0 : similar anisotropic fermi velocities and epc of the two @xmath17 fermi sheets , and of the two @xmath19 fermi sheets , respectively , allow the reduction to an effective two - band model .",
    "allowing for different order parameters for each of these two ( @xmath17 and @xmath19 ) effective bands increases the effective coupling constant relevant for superconductivity and is , together with the extremely strong coupling between one phonon mode and the @xmath17 bands , responsible for the high @xmath5 of mgb@xmath0 @xcite . later",
    "numerical calculations using fully anisotropic eliashberg theory @xcite qualitatively confirmed the simpler effective two band model by liu _",
    "et al._. the gap distribution of gap values over the fermi surface resulting from these calculations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fs ] . note that these results apply for hypothetical mgb@xmath0 without any impurity scattering @xcite . in the 2d @xmath17 band , the superconducting gap - to-@xmath10 ratio is slightly enhanced with respect to bcs theory , while the gap in the 3d @xmath19 band is about two to three times smaller , and the corresponding gap - to-@xmath10 ratio is substantially below bcs predictions .    in order to have two superconducting gaps staying open up to the bulk @xmath5 , it is not only necessary to have a sizeable coupling between the two sets of bands by scattering of carriers by phonons .",
    "in addition , scattering of carriers between the two sets of bands by impurities needs to be very low ; otherwise , any gap differences would be `` washed out '' by impurity scattering , accompanied by a @xmath5 lowering @xcite . in mgb@xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath36 impurity scattering is fortunately very small even in rather dirty samples because @xmath17 and @xmath19 bands are formed from different local orbitals _",
    "orthogonal on an atomic scale _ and therefore @xmath36 hybridization is very small @xcite . on the other hand , the _ intraband _ variation of the gaps as calculated for the clean case @xcite and shown in fig",
    "[ fs ] was argued to be completely washed out in any realistic sample due to intraband impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "the two band two gap scenario is meanwhile well verified experimentally , from a large number of measurements both on polycrystalline material and single crystals : the band structure calculations are in agreement with de  haas - van  alphen @xcite and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite results , and the strong coupling between the @xmath34 phonon mode and the @xmath17 bands is evidenced by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite and raman @xcite measurements : spectroscopic measurements with various techniques , including point contact spectroscopy @xcite , scanning tunnelling spectroscopy @xcite , photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , break junction ( `` s@xmath26i@xmath26s '' ) tunnelling spectroscopy @xcite , and raman scattering @xcite observe directly two gaps . moreover , the two different gaps and their location in @xmath37 space on the @xmath17 and @xmath19 fermi sheets have been directly observed recently by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "the unusual temperature dependence of ( zero field ) thermodynamic properties of the superconducting state , as seen by bulk probes , particularly specific heat @xcite and thermal conductivity @xcite , can also be accounted for quantitatively @xcite with two - gap superconductivity , as can the incomplete isotope effect @xcite . due to the existence of two ,",
    "coupled , superconducting condensates with different energy and length scales as well as very different anisotropies , a variety of interesting and unusual effects can be expected in the vortex state in non zero magnetic field , as will be discussed in the next sections , which focus on results by torque magnetometry .    in summary ,",
    "magnesium diboride is peculiar in that two sets of bands with _ very different average gap values _",
    "contribute to the dos at the fs _ with similar strengths _",
    ", and that they have _ different `` dimensionalities '' _ ( or more accurately very different fermi velocity anisotropies ) and _ different coupling strengths to the phonon subsystem_. for the actual observation of two band superconductivity , it is also crucial that there is some coupling , but at the same time extremely low impurity scattering between the two sets of bands .",
    "two band superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 leads to very peculiar effects showing up in a vast range of experiments .",
    "experimental results in zero field can be well explained quantitatively within the two gap model .",
    "in mgb@xmath0 , as we have seen in sec .  [ twoband ] , the crystal structure as well as the electronic and phononic band structure are all far from isotropic .",
    "this should lead to anisotropic superconducting state properties as well , for example to an anisotropic upper critical field @xmath3 .",
    "early measurements on polycrystalline or thin film mgb@xmath0 @xcite as well as electrical transport measurements on single crystals @xcite indeed found such anisotropy , but with a very wide span of values reported .",
    "the upper critical field is the maximum field for which superconductivity in the mixed state can persist .",
    "the mixed state becomes energetically unfavorable when the vortex cores overlap too strongly , since the order parameter is suppressed in the cores .",
    "considering the isotropic case , the vortex core radius is given by the coherence length @xmath38 , the typical length scale for variations of the order parameter , which ( ignoring the difference between gl and bcs coherence lengths ) at zero temperature is related to the superconducting gap by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an average velocity at the fermi surface .",
    "the upper critical field is given by @xmath41 with the flux quantum @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "anisotropic superconductors are usually treated within the phenomenological _ anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory _ ( aglt ) , which is obtained from the isotropic ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory through replacing the effective mass @xcite @xmath43 in the gl free energy functional @xcite by an effective mass _ tensor _ , with values @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 along the principal axes @xcite . in the most usual case of uniaxial anisotropy",
    ", all anisotropy is incorporated into the anisotropy parameter @xmath47 , a simple constant . from the free energy variation it follows that @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the penetration depth , the typical length scale for variations of the ( local ) magnetic field , given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the superfluid density ( density of superconducting carriers ) , @xmath52 is the ( band averaged ) effective mass tensor @xcite , @xmath53 is the electron charge and @xmath54 the speed of light .",
    "when the field @xmath55 is not applied parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath54-axis or the @xmath56-plane , scaling relations apply , for example the aglt angular dependence of the upper critical field is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the angle between the field and the @xmath54-axis of the sample @xcite . since effective masses @xcite are temperature and field independent , at least as long as polaronic effects and the thermal expansion of the lattice can be neglected , the anisotropy parameter @xmath59 is assumed to be constant as well .    in materials with complex fermi surfaces",
    ", the situation may not be as simple as outlined above .",
    "for example , slight temperature dependences of the @xmath3 anisotropy , which we call @xmath4 hereafter , were observed in some materials , such as nbse@xmath0 @xcite , and explained by microscopic theories taking into account non - local effects @xcite .",
    "these theories show that the temperature dependence of @xmath59 can not be attributed to an anisotropy of the band effective mass tensor , unless it is also wave - vector dependent .",
    "an anisotropic energy gap , caused by an anisotropic attractive electron - electron interaction , however , can lead to variations of @xmath59 with @xmath60 .    in mgb@xmath0 ,",
    "the situation is particularly complex , due to the two sets of bands : the @xmath19 band has a nearly isotropic fermi velocity and a small superconducting gap , which would lead to an isotropic coherence length of the order of @xmath61 .",
    "the highly anisotropic @xmath17 band with a larger gap would have a coherence length anisotropy of about 6 , with @xmath62 .",
    "which set of bands controls the bulk upper critical field and it s anisotropy @xmath4 ?     vs.  angle @xmath58 data of an mgb@xmath0 single crystal ( b ) , under four different conditions .",

    ", we carried out torque measurements in fields up to @xmath65 on several mgb@xmath0 single crystals with volumes between about @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",

    "the small gap and low isotropic upper critical field corresponds a large ( direction - independent ) coherence length @xmath302 , setting also the radius of the vortex cores .",
    "hence , for a pure `` @xmath19 bands superconductor '' , the limitation to the london model given by `` no core overlap '' or @xmath274 translates ( for all field directions ) to @xmath303 .    the coupling between @xmath19 and @xmath17 bands by interband pairing , quasiparticle transfer etc .",
    "transforms @xmath171 from an upper critical field to a mere crossover in the middle of the mixed state of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "however , even as a broad crossover , @xmath171 may be expected to set a new field scale significantly affecting the mixed state properties .",
    "furthermore , the whole vortex structure should be affected , with each vortex having two cores , one in the @xmath17 bands and another one with much larger radius in the @xmath19 bands . for both points",

    "the two superconducting gaps are for example resolved in point contact spectroscopy measurements , as mentioned in sec.[twoband ] .",
    "the feature associated with the smaller ( @xmath19 ) gap was shown to disappear by application of a magnetic field of the order of @xmath263 , independent of the field direction .",
    "the @xmath171 crossover is also evidenced in a abrupt change of the field dependence of the specific heat coefficient @xmath304 ( where @xmath305 is the specific heat ) on single crystals @xcite .",

    "the vortex lattice in the @xmath19 bands was still visible in fields as high as @xmath241 , which proves that superconductivity remains in the @xmath19 bands due to coupling with the @xmath17 bands even above @xmath171 .",

    "koshelev and golubov @xcite pointed out that the behavior of the weak band ( @xmath19 bands ) partial density of states ( as seen by sts and relevant for the field dependent specific heat and thermal conductivity ) can be rather different from the behavior of the weak band order parameter . on the one hand ,",
    "the crossover in the ( spatially maximal ) order parameter field dependence below and above the weak band `` upper critical field '' is much smoother than the one of the ( spatially averaged ) density of states . on the other hand ,",

    "with regard to the applicability of the london model , the order parameter is the more relevant quantity , since it is the order parameter that is coupled to the supercurrent density , and thus to the local field variation around the vortex center and to the interaction between vortices @xcite . from the relatively smooth variation of the maximum order parameter in the weak band",
    "we conclude that there is still a large spatial @xmath19 bands order parameter variation up to the bulk upper critical field , which points against the applicability of the london model in fields larger than @xmath315 .",

    "the effective anisotropy @xmath317 is just a weighted average .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath317 , sensitive to the vortex cores only , does not indicate a field dependence of the coherence length , but rather that phenomenological formulas should take into account that there are two different coherence lengths in mgb@xmath0 , @xmath320 and @xmath321 . whenever this is not taken into account , the anisotropy of the best `` effective coherence length '' needed to describe experimental data _ has _ to be field dependent due to the different `` intrinsic upper critical fields '' of the @xmath17 and @xmath19 bands .",
    "an important anisotropy effect is the distortion of the vortex lattice in fields tilted away from the @xmath54 axis , observed for example in the strongly anisotropic cuprate superconductors by small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) @xcite : the nearest neighbors fall no longer on a circle , but on an ellipse with axis ratio @xmath322 given by @xmath323 in superconductors with a single constant anisotropy parameter . in superconductors with no single anisotropy , we can define a lattice distortion anisotropy @xmath324 : @xmath325 for @xmath326 the distortion is determined by the penetration depth anisotropy in the london limit @xcite : @xmath327 .",

    "these intrinsic anisotropies of the @xmath19 and the @xmath17 bands probably do not depend on field or temperature .",
    "any mixed state property is then determined by the relative contributions from both bands and if described in terms of traditional single band models has to be assigned some effective anisotropy , depending on the contributions of the two sets of bands . at low temperatures and fields ,",
    "both bands contribute roughly equally to the properties , in accordance to their similar contribution to the density of states at the fermi level ( see sec .  [ twoband ] ) .",
    "since the superconductivity is weaker in the @xmath19 bands ( smaller gap ) , it gets depressed faster by perturbations such as an external field or thermal excitations .",

    "the magnitude of the peaks is reduced quickly by increasing the temperature .",
    "the main panel shows the temperature dependence of the characteristic fields .",
    "the abrupt end of @xmath397 and @xmath398 is due to the decreased sensitivity of the magnetometer ( in fact , the peak effect is discernible at temperatures up to @xmath399 in measurements of the torque vs angle , such as shown in fig.[pe1]b ) @xcite ) and due to the smearing of the effective pinning landscape by thermal fluctuations @xcite , as indicated by the drop of the irreversibility line .",
    "in a recent report of low frequency ac susceptibility measurements @xcite , the peak effect was observed for @xmath98 at temperatures up to about @xmath272 , and interpreted in terms of the order - disorder transition as well .",
    "@xcite report the transformation of the pe into a `` step - like '' ac susceptibility for the temperature interval between @xmath400 and @xmath401 , and interpreted this as a signature of thermal melting . in our case ,",
    "no step - like feature in the reversible torque was observed in the continuation of the pe .",
    "it should be emphasized , that thermal melting so far below @xmath3 would be at odds @xcite with theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium order - disorder transition , which corresponds to @xmath386 @xcite , is located in fields of about @xmath8 in crystal b and in about @xmath402 in crystal c. the peak effect observed in other crystals by transport was reported to be located even closer to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these differences are natural for a disorder - induced phase transition in crystals with varying degrees of disorder .",
    "form and location of the pe observed in mgb@xmath0 resembles results obtained on nbse@xmath0 single crystals with varying degrees of disorder @xcite , but are rather different from the order - disorder transition in cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "we have reviewed superconducting state anisotropy effects in magnesium diboride mgb@xmath0 , with the main focus on results obtained by torque magnetometry .",
    "mgb@xmath0 is a `` two band '' or `` two gap '' superconductor : the superconductivity is fermi sheet dependent in an extreme way , with a large gap ( strong superconductivity ) on the @xmath17 fermi sheets and a roughly three times smaller gap on the @xmath19 fermi sheets .",
    "this is possible because of the very different coupling to the lattice vibrations in these two sets of bands and because of there is very low hybridization between them , resulting in a very low impurity scattering rate between them .",
    "pronounced and unusual anisotropy effects originate in this two band superconductivity and in the very different electronic anisotropies of the two sets of bands .",
    "one of the unusual anisotropy effects in the superconducting state is the very pronounced temperature dependence of the upper critical field anisotropy @xmath4 , falling from a value close to ( with some sample dependence ) the electronic anisotropy of the @xmath17 bands ( @xmath403 ) at zero temperature to low values of the order of about @xmath404 for temperatures approaching @xmath405 .",
    "there is a good qualitative agreement between various experiments as well as theoretical studies on this .",
    "the origin of this temperature dependence of @xmath4 is the increased `` mixing '' of the two sets of bands by thermally excited quasiparticles at higher temperatures @xmath26 at low temperatures the upper critical field is mainly determined by the stronger superconducting @xmath17 bands , which has the higher field scale .",
    "the interplay between the different field scales , anisotropies , and interband mixing also leads to the observed deviations of the angular dependence of @xmath3 from conventional behavior .",
    "no general consensus has yet emerged concerning the impact of the different intraband impurity scattering rate on the upper critical field . concerning the lower critical fields ,",
    "the available experimental data is sparse , preventing the drawing of firm conclusions .",
    "the anisotropy effects on the upper critical field , as well as on other quantities , implies a breakdown of the standard ( one band ) anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory , except in a tiny ( less than @xmath406 ) region below @xmath5 .",
    "below this region , microscopic calculations have to be used , or at least a two band formulation of the anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory involving two order parameters and two sets of length scales @xmath38 and @xmath19 , as well as some description of the coupling between these two components .    in the mixed state ,",
    "experimentally deduced anisotropies are different from different quantities , and also often depend on the model used to analyze the data .",
    "however , all experimental results [ at least those spanning an extended field region including ( at low temperatures ) the range of @xmath407 find anisotropies that are monotonically increasing as a function of the magnetic field and that are consistent with reaching @xmath4 for @xmath408 or already in lower fields . in the case of torque magnetometry , describing the data with an equation allowing for different anisotropies of the penetration depth and the coherence length yields anisotropies of these length scales that are rather similar .",
    "the field dependent effective anisotropies of various mixed state quantities are qualitatively well described by a crossover from a low field region , where the quantities are determined by similar contributions from the isotropic @xmath19 and the anisotropic @xmath17 bands , to a high field region , where they are ( almost ) determined by the @xmath17 bands alone .",
    "this crossover is due to the very low `` intrinsic upper critical field of the @xmath19 bands '' @xmath171 , an order of magnitude lower than the one ( in @xmath54 direction ) of the @xmath17 bands , because of the weaker superconductivity ( smaller gap ) in the @xmath19 bands . in decoupled @xmath19 and @xmath17 superconductors",
    ", there would be a sharp transition at @xmath171 , but the coupling between the two sets of band transforms this into a smooth crossover , which in addition may be qualitatively different for the gaps and the quasi - particle excitations in the vortex cores .",
    "this may also explain the qualitatively different forms of the field dependence of the anisotropy as observed for example in torque , small angle neutron scattering , and specific heat experiments .",
    "the existence of different length scales for the two sets of bands , rather directly demonstrated for the coherence length ( for example by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and analysis of field dependent specific heat data ) , but not yet for the penetration depth ( naturally , there is only one local field distribution for the whole of mgb@xmath0 ) , strongly suggests that any phenomenological model should be extended to a two band version before being applied to the analysis of data obtained on mgb@xmath0 @xmath26 otherwise obtained `` best fit '' single band values of basic length scales will be effective values that acquire a field dependence due to the field dependence of the relative contributions of the two sets of bands , although the bands specific length scales likely are not field dependent . in the case of the london model , which was used so successfully for the analysis of torque , small angle neutron scattering , muon spin rotation , magnetization , and many other data measured e.g.  on cuprate superconductors , it is rather unclear whether such an extension can be successful .",
    "this is so because of the large overlap of the @xmath19 bands vortex cores throughout most of the mixed state phase diagram , which violates a basic assumption of the london model .",
    "it is clear , that while the puzzling mixed state anisotropy effects may be understood on a qualitative level , there are still open questions concerning their more quantitative description .    from the study of cuprate superconductors is known that the mixed state can be strongly affected by thermal fluctuations and inevitably present material disorder , leading to phase diagrams containing more transition lines than the upper and lower critical fields .",
    "the material disorder leads for example to a destruction of the ( quasi)ordered vortex lattice in fields lower than the upper critical field .",
    "this happens in an order - disorder transition , which was also observed in conventional superconductors , such as nbse@xmath0 .",
    "this transition , manifested by a peak in the critical current density with peculiar history effects is observed in mgb@xmath0 as well , by torque magnetometry , as well as various other measurements .",
    "mgb@xmath0 is interesting in terms of these additional `` vortex matter '' transitions as well , because of the intermediate importance of thermal fluctuations , compared to cuprate and conventional superconductors .",
    "a melting transition driven predominantly by thermal fluctuations has not been observed clearly in mgb@xmath0 so far though .",
    "we note that there are possible influences of the two band superconductivity on the non - equilibrium properties and these additional transitions of vortex matter as well .",
    "however , a direct influence has not been indicated by any experiment so far , and is thus left for future studies .",
    "we would like to conclude this chapter by briefly commenting on the consequences of the results that were reviewed for applications of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the relatively high @xmath5 and critical current densities ( not affected by `` weak links '' across boundaries ) , coupled with the easy and cheap processing ( as compared to the high @xmath5 cuprate superconductors ) has created also an intense technical interest in mgb@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the relatively large electronic anisotropy of the @xmath17 bands , which inevitable becomes the relevant anisotropy when the magnetic field is increased to values depressing the superconductivity in the isotropic @xmath19 bands , rather degrades the possibility of granular mgb@xmath0 material to carry high critical current densities @xmath409 in high magnetic fields : correspondingly , @xmath409 has been found to be a rapidly decreasing function of the applied magnetic field @xcite . in high quality single crystals ,",
    "magnetization curves are almost reversible in a wide region even at low temperature [ see fig .  [ pe1]a ) ] .",
    "it will be important to maximize the pinning properties by increasing the disordered vortex phase , which is restricted to a small region below @xmath3 in clean material ( see fig .",
    "[ phd775deg ] ) , through the controlled introduction of uncorrelated material defects .",
    "this increases the processing requirements for mgb@xmath0 based materials for high field applications .",
    "however , the potential of strongly affecting also the anisotropy by selectively tuning the intraband impurity scattering rates @xcite may lead to applicability enhancements that can not yet be predicted .",
