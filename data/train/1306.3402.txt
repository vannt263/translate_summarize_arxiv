    "the recently proposed emulation of the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in condensed matter by means of similar but weak ( i.e. , theoretically tractable and experimentally controllable ) interactions in binary bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite has drawn much attention , in the spirit of using dilute bose gases as _ quantum simulators _ @xcite . in this context , bec composed as mixtures of different atomic states may represent _ pseudo - spin _",
    "systems , with the multi - component mean - field wave functions emulating the spinor order parameter . in experiments ,",
    "the artificial so coupling has been implemented in both bosonic so - bose , so - bose2 and fermionic @xcite atomic gases , by means of counterpropagating laser beams which couple two internal hyperfine states of the atom by a stimulated two - photon raman transition . in this connection , it is relevant to mention that the true so coupling ( rather than the emulated one ) is possible too in bec composed of spinor bosons true - so and in magnon condensates @xcite .",
    "the single - particle so hamiltonian which can be implemented in the bec is @xmath0 + { \\frac{\\hbar \\omega } { 2}}\\sigma _ { x}-{\\frac{k_{l}}{m}}\\ { \\hat{p}}% _ { x}\\sigma _ { z } ,   \\label{hsp}\\]]where @xmath1 is the momentum operator , @xmath2 is a trapping potential , @xmath3 is the recoil wavenumber induced by the interaction with the laser beams , @xmath4 is the frequency of the raman coupling , which is responsible for the rabi mixing between the two states , and @xmath5 are the pauli matrices .",
    "recently , considerable attention has been drawn to models combining the so coupling , which is a linear feature , and mean - field nonlinearities , which are induced , as usual @xcite , by inter - atomic collisions .",
    "various dynamical effects have been investigated in the framework of such nonlinear systems , including the self - trapping and formation of solitons @xcite , vortical patterns so - vortices , the interplay of the so coupling and dipole - dipole interactions @xcite , the modulational instability of uniform states in so - coupled bec @xcite , etc .",
    "the objective of the present work is to present an effective 1d model for the so- and rabi - coupled _ relatively dense _ binary bec , and investigate basic properties if trapped modes in the framework of the model .",
    "the _ dimension reduction _ , i.e. , derivation of the 1d system from the underlying set of the 3d gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) with cubic terms , leads to nonpolynomial nonlinearity , as was previously demonstrated in the context of single- @xcite and binary @xcite condensates with the attractive nonlinearity , as well as for the repulsive nonlinearity delgado . in the former case ,",
    "the corresponding nonpolynomial nonlinear schrdinger equations ( npses )  generate solitons , as the usual 1d gpes with the postulated cubic nonlinearity .",
    "however , on the contrary to the 1d cubic equations , the npses predict the _ onset of collapse _ in the effectively 1d solitons at a critical strength of the self - attraction @xcite .",
    "this feature makes the 1d solitons similar to 3d solitons , which are also subject to the collapse above a critical value of the number of atoms , depending on parameters of the bec - trapping potential .",
    "detailed numerical investigations have demonstrated that the near - collapse dynamics of 3d solitons ( although not the collapse itself ) is quite accurately approximated by their 1d counterparts in the framework of the npse @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we derive a system of two npses coupled by linear and nonlinear terms , which include new terms accounting for the emulated so interaction .",
    "the derivation is performed for both the repulsive and attractive signs of the inter - atomic interactions , and is followed by the analysis of trapped modes , for both signs of the nonlinearity . in the case of the self - repulsion , the trapping is imposed by an axial harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential , while the attractive condensates self - traps into solitons .",
    "the analysis concentrates on new features of the externally trapped and self - trapped modes in the presence of the so - emulating interactions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "the derivation of the npse  system for the binary condensate with the so and rabi interactions between the components is reported in section ii .",
    "this section also includes analytical approximations which help to understand characteristic features of the trapped modes in the so - coupled dense condensates .",
    "basic numerical results are reported in section iii . in both cases of the self - repulsion and self - attraction",
    ", the nonpolynomial nonlinearity strongly affects shapes of the trapped modes and solitons .",
    "the most essential result is a _ reduction _ of the collapse threshold for the solitons under the action of the so and rabi interactions .",

    "<S> we consider a binary bose - einstein condensate with linear and nonlinear interactions between its components , which emulate the spinor system with spin - orbit ( so ) and rabi couplings . for a relatively dense condensate , 1d coupled equations with the nonpolynomial nonlinearity of both repulsive and attractive signs </S>",
    "<S> are derived from the 3d gross - pitaevskii equations . </S>",
    "<S> profiles of modes confined in an external potential under the action of the self - repulsion , and self - trapped solitons in the case of the self - attraction , are found in a numerical form and by means of analytical approximations . in the former case , the interplay of the so and rabi couplings with the repulsive nonlinearity strongly distorts shapes of the trapped modes , adding conspicuous side lobes to them . in the case of the attractive nonlinearity , </S>",
    "<S> the most essential result is reduction of the collapse threshold under the action of the so and rabi couplings . </S>"
