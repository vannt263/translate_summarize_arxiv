    "quantum gravity with a non - vanishing cosmological constant formulated in ashtekar s spin - connection variables @xcite has interesting physical states given by the exponential of the chern - simons functional @xcite and appropriate transformations thereof . in order to elucidate the physical meaning of such states",
    "it is interesting to consider their restrictions to spatially homogeneous cosmological models . in a recent paper @xcite , henceforth quoted as [ i ] ,",
    "we considered the diagonal bianchi ix models with positive cosmological constant from this point of view and found that five linearly independent physical states in the metric representation could be derived from the chern - simons functional .",
    "this set of solutions was found to be in one to one correspondence with the set of topologically different integration contours which exist for the generalized fourier - transformation from the ashtekar - representation to the metric representation . due to the positivity of the cosmological constant the quantum states found in [ i ]",
    "describe an expanding ( or collapsing ) classically interpretable lorentzian universe at large scale parameters . on the other hand , at sufficiently small scale parameters",
    "the action defined by the exponent of the wavefunction becomes imaginary and can be associated only with a quantum mechanically allowed euclidean universe .",
    "the two `` phases '' are separated by a caustic surface in minisuperspace .",
    "it was found that only one of the five linearly independent states defines a normalizable probability distribution on this caustic , that this state satisfies the no - boundary condition of hartle and hawking @xcite semi - classically for @xmath2 ( which means on scales large compared to the planck scale ) , and that , again for @xmath2 , it picks out an initial condition which evolves into a classically interpretable lorentzian universe . for details and further literature",
    "we refer to [ i ] .",
    "it is now of interest to consider also what happens for negative cosmological constant , even though it seems very unlikely that our universe has @xmath3 ( the age - problem resulting from recently measured high values of the hubble - parameter @xcite and the measured large age of globular star - clusters and also the observed high density of galaxies with large red - shifts seem to call for @xmath1 ) .",
    "our motivation is rather to try the method of [ i ] for a model - universe which recollapses , i.e. for which quantum - mechanically a classically interpretable lorentzian evolution phase is bounded for small _ and _ large values of the scale parameter by euclidean evolution phases .",
    "therefore , we have to expect the appearance of two caustic surfaces in the minsuperspace of these models , one at small and the other at large scale parameter .",
    "is there still a wavefunction , or are there even several , which give a normalizable probability distribution on these surfaces , and how are these wavefunctions related to the no - boundary state ?    to answer these questions we apply in section ii the method of [ i ] to obtain expressions for again five linearly independent physical states and identify the caustic surfaces in minisuperspace . in section iii",
    "we determine the behavior of the absolute square of the wavefunctions on the caustic and identify a single physical state which gives a normalizable probability distribution in this way . in section iv",
    "we summarize our results . within the narrow class of models we consider here they seem to rule out , with high probability , a classically evolving universe with @xmath3 .",
    "in this section we want to construct solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation for the diagonal bianchi type ix model with a cosmological constant @xmath3 ,    @xmath4    @xmath5     + in this notation @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote derivatives with respect to the variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . by writing the wheeler - dewitt equation in the form ( [ 1.0 ] ) we have assumed a specific factor - ordering , which is suggested by a supersymmetric extension of the model @xcite .",
    "a different factor - ordering is obtained by considering ( [ 1.0 ] ) with @xmath10 replaced by @xmath11 . in the present paper , as in [ i ] , we will restrict ourselves to the factor - ordering as in ( [ 1.0 ] ) , while a brief comment on the solutions in the second case @xmath12 is given in appendix a.    if the expression ( [ 1.0 + ] ) for @xmath10 is inserted into the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 1.0 ] ) , the following more explicit form is obtained    @xmath13     + where we have introduced the mean scale factor @xmath14 . as in the case @xmath15 , solutions of ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be obtained by a transformation to the ashtekar representation , where the chern - simons functional , restricted to the bianchi type ix case , turns out to be an exact solution .",
    "two of the fourier integrals which occur in the transformation back to the metric representation can be carried out analytically without any loss of generality and afterwards the same one dimensional integral representation as in [ i ] is obtained : , the _ total _ action , including the part which effects the similarity transformation between ashtekar and metric variables , has been defined as the exponent of the integrand . ]",
    "@xmath16    @xmath17     + here we have introduced the new variable @xmath18 and parameter @xmath19    @xmath20     + thereby effectively reducing the number of parameters occuring in ( [ 1.2 ] ) , and we shall also make use of the variables @xmath21 defined by    @xmath22     + where the @xmath23 are the entries of the diagonal anisotropy matrix @xmath24 . the integration contour @xmath25 in the integral - representation ( [ 1.2 ] ) can be chosen quite freely , as long as a sufficiently strong fall - off for the integrand and its @xmath26-derivatives at the borders @xmath27 of @xmath25 is guaranteed .",
    "the proportionality factor left open in ( [ 1.2 ] ) may depend on @xmath19 and will be fixed later .    while in the case @xmath15 the curves of steepest _ descent _ of @xmath28 were of interest , now , due to the different sign of @xmath0 , the curves of steepest _ ascent _ lead to suitable integration contours .",
    "moreover , new possibilities for the location of the saddle - points occur , which we classify as follows :    * by choosing @xmath29 sufficiently small at fixed @xmath30 , it is always possible to make all five saddle points of @xmath31 lie on the real axis of the complex @xmath32-plane , defining the _",
    "euclid i_-region of minisuperspace .",
    "note , however , that the corresponding points in the @xmath26-plane of fig.[grcsd- ] ( here @xmath33 ) are real - valued only for @xmath34 , whereas real @xmath32-values with @xmath35 are mapped into complex conjugate pairs of points on the axes @xmath36 and periodic repetitions thereof . * except for the case @xmath37 , where all five saddle - points are on the real @xmath32-axis , there is the possibility for two of the saddle - points to become complex in the @xmath32-plane , which defines the _",
    "lorentzian regime_. * for large values of @xmath38 one always enters the _ euclid ii _",
    "region , where again all five saddle - points of @xmath31 become real - valued .",
    "some typical locations of the saddle - points in these different regimes of minisuperspace and the corresponding curves of steepest ascent are presented in fig.[grcsd- ] .",
    "0 cm    by passing from one of these regions to another , a _",
    "situation occurs , where two of the saddle - points confluate .",
    "we will refer to the corresponding hypersurface in minisuperspace as the _ caustic _ ; it has been calculated and is plotted in fig.[grkaustik- ] .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath15 the caustic obtained here consists of an upper and a lower branch , which are connected just by a single _ point _ at @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , there are _ kinks _ at @xmath40 and also at the other half - rays of the @xmath30-plane , related to the former by the typical @xmath30-symmetries of diagonal bianchi ix .",
    "obviously , an exactly isotropic universe @xmath41 has to stay purely euclidean throughout its evolution .",
    "on the other hand , `` large '' universes with lorentzian geometry must become very anisotropic .",
    "apart from the possibility of a negative cosmological constant very close to zero , which would allow for large scale parameters even at @xmath29-values of order one , it seems impossible for the model under investigation to describe the universe observed today .    0",
    "cm    nevertheless , let us now construct a basis of solutions to the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) by choosing topologically independent integration contours @xmath25 in the representation ( [ 1.2 ] ) .    0 cm    using the curves defined in fig.[grintc ] we introduce the following solutions",
    "@xmath42    @xmath43     + which , by definition , are real - valued and normalized in accordance with    @xmath44     + the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 occuring in ( [ 1.5 ] ) are the usual modified bessel functions with index @xmath47 .",
    "it will be of some advantage to replace the solutions @xmath48 and @xmath49 by    @xmath50     + then saddle - point expansions of the integrals ( [ 1.5 ] ) in the limit @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath30 fixed , reveal    @xmath53     + where the upper index `` @xmath47 '' denotes the solutions of the @xmath54-model given in [ i ] .",
    "without proof we mention that @xmath55 , are three asymmetric solutions which generate each other by cyclic permutations of the @xmath21 , so consequently the sum of these states ,    @xmath56     + besides @xmath57 and @xmath58 , turns out to be symmetric with respect to arbitrary @xmath21-permutations .    up to different normalization factors , the asymptotic behavior in the limit @xmath59 can immediately be extracted from the corresponding expansions in [ i ] by taking account of the negative sign of @xmath0 .",
    "the only difficulty lies in the determination of the saddle - points , which give the dominating contribution to the different solutions in this limit .",
    "a detailed calculation finally yields    @xmath60    @xmath61     + at @xmath41 , i.e. while @xmath57 falls of rapidly for @xmath62 , the wavefunction @xmath58 is strongly divergent in the same limit .",
    "moreover , since @xmath58 _ always _ gets its dominant contribution from the real saddle - point @xmath63 ( corresponding to the points @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the complex @xmath26-plane of fig.[grcsd- ] via @xmath66 ) , just euclidean geometries are described by this state , so we will reject @xmath58 as a physically relevant solution .",
    "note , however , that it is the only state which satisfies the _ no - boundary _ condition in the limit @xmath67 , hence the name of this wavefunction .    to give the asymptotic behavior in the limit @xmath59 for the states @xmath55",
    ", it will be helpful to consider    @xmath68     + instead .",
    "for these solutions the asymptotic expansions    @xmath69     + hold , so they fall off very rapidly for @xmath62 ( remember the negative sign of @xmath19 ! ) .    by considering additional asymptotic expansions for large anisotropy",
    "it is possible to show that the four states @xmath70 , are all normalizable on minisuperspace in the distribution sense ( see [ i ] for a discussion of this point for @xmath1 ) , i.e. so far we are left with a still four dimensional space of physically interesting solutions .",
    "however , while in the lorentzian regime @xmath57 receives saddle - point contributions exclusively from the saddle - points at _ complex _ @xmath32 and thus describes a lorentzian universe in this part of minisuperspace , the states @xmath55 , get additional euclidean contributions of similar order of magnitude from _ real _ saddle - points and are therefore hard to interpret .",
    "the classical trajectories which are generated by @xmath57 in the semi - classical limit @xmath2 _ in the lorentzian regime _ can be computed by solving the equations    @xmath71     + where we have chosen the lapse - function to be @xmath72 . while the complex saddle - point @xmath73 occuring in ( [ 1.13 ] )",
    "is intended to correspond to the point @xmath74 of fig.[grcsd- ] , the complex conjugate saddle - point @xmath75 , which describes the time - reversed classical evolution , can be considered with the same right .",
    "the corresponding second branch of the classical evolution of the universe is actually _ needed _ to define the continuation of a classical trajectory which has reached the caustic : in approaching the caustic the saddle - points @xmath73 and @xmath76 confluate and become real - valued , so that , in accordance with ( [ 1.13 ] ) , the time - derivatives of @xmath77 and @xmath30 vanish .",
    "to continue such a trajectory in time , the time - reversed version of ( [ 1.13 ] ) has to be considered . since the universe is `` reflected '' in this way whenever it meets the caustic , and since in the generic case the classical trajectories have both of their endpoints on the caustic , _ oscillating _ universes are described by @xmath57 .",
    "the numerical results for the classical trajectories which are obtained in the plane @xmath78 of the minisuperspace are presented in fig.[class.traj ] .",
    "0 cm    we should stress one important difference in the pictures which are obtained for the different signs of @xmath8 :    while for @xmath79 all trajectories run to infinite anisotropy ( which is , indeed , a peculiarity of the special @xmath30-direction , corresponding to a kink on the caustic , cf .",
    "fig.[grkaustik- ] ) , in the case @xmath80 the trajectories meet the lower branch of the caustic again at a finite @xmath8-value , representing the general situation .",
    "this feature gives rise to the existence of a special trajectory with coinciding start- and endpoints , hence describing a universe that never really becomes lorentzian .",
    "the corresponding points in minisuperspace can be calculated analytically , requiring the solution of ( [ 1.13 ] ) to be _ tangential _ to the caustic , with the result    @xmath81{2}\\,\\left ( \\frac{2}{5 } \\right ) ^ { \\frac{4}{3}}\\ , \\qquad \\beta_{+}+i\\,\\beta_{-}=\\frac{1}{6 } ( \\ln 5 - 5 \\ln 2 ) \\ , e^{\\mbox{{\\footnotesize $ \\frac{2 \\pi i n}{3}$}}}\\ , \\qquad n\\,\\epsilon\\,\\{-1,0,1\\}\\ .\\ ] ]     + these points will play an important role in the following section .",
    "since the classical lorentzian evolution of the universe described by the wavefunctions @xmath70 , is bounded by the caustic in minisuperspace , the value of @xmath82 _ on the caustic _ predicted by the different solutions is of particular interest .",
    "in fact @xmath82 governs the realization of the different possible histories of the universe and may thus be interpreted as the `` initial '' value distribution for the classical evolution .",
    "however , at this stage a new problem arises due to the different branches of the caustic . since the semi - classical trajectories allways can be passed through in both directions , it is impossible to distinguish between their start- and endpoints .",
    "the distributions of @xmath82 on the upper and lower branch of the caustic may therefore be considered with the same right , and we will always discuss them together in the following .",
    "the numerical results obtained for @xmath83 and @xmath84 on the lower caustic are given in fig.[grkaustl ] , and fig.[grkaustu ] shows the behavior on the upper caustic , which is very similar for the two different solutions . in the following the additional indices `` @xmath26 '' and",
    "`` @xmath85 '' denote the upper and lower branch of the caustic , respectively .",
    "0 cm 1.5 cm    0 cm    while on the upper caustic both distributions fall off rapidly with increasing @xmath30 and may be shown to be integrable over the @xmath30-plane , there are @xmath30-directions on the lower caustic , in which @xmath86 approaches a finite value at infinity . consequently , the wavefunctions on the lower branch are _ not _ square - integrable , and hence difficult to interpret as probability distributions .",
    "nevertheless , as in the case @xmath1 , one may construct a new wavefunction as a linear combination of the two symmetric wavefunctions @xmath57 and @xmath87 : by normalizing @xmath57 and @xmath87 to approach unity in the critical @xmath30-directions , the difference of these new functions is square - integrable on the _ full _ caustic . to give an explicit expression for the quantum state obtained in this way",
    ", we introduce the integrals    @xmath88    @xmath89     + which , as far as we know , have no simple representation in terms of tabulated functions .",
    "defining now    @xmath90     + the new state can be written in the form    @xmath91     + where the overall normalization factor has again been chosen to make @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath94 on the caustic has been computed for fig.[grkausth ] .",
    "taking account of the full distribution , three maxima on the lower branch of the caustic pick out special initial values for the classical evolution of the universe . the general representation ( [ 1.2 ] )",
    "easily reveals that the wavefunction becomes arbitrarily sharply concentrated about these maxima in the limit @xmath95 , i.e. in particular in the limit @xmath2 at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , in the semi - classical limit there are just three histories of the universe which occur with significant probability .",
    "0 cm    in the following we shall be interested in the special points of minisuperspace where the maxima of @xmath96 arise . using the saddle - point method for @xmath95 the asymptotic behavior of the integrals defined in ( [ 2.1 ] ) after some calculation yields    @xmath97     + and with this result the relation    @xmath98     + can be shown to hold at least on the lower caustic . since @xmath94 is a real - valued , non - vanishing wavefunction , the maxima of @xmath99 coincide with the maxima of @xmath94 , and using ( [ 2.5 ] ) they may also be calculated from @xmath57 in the semi - classical limit . by performing again a saddle - point expansion for @xmath95 ,",
    "now in the integral representation ( [ 1.5 ] ) of @xmath57 , the maxima of @xmath57 on the caustic can be calculated analytically with the result given exactly by ( [ 1.14 ] ) .",
    "consequently , within the class of solutions considered here , the _ only _ quantum state that is square - integrable on the full caustic turns out to predict a universe which never becomes lorentzian in the classical limit ( albeit classical lorentzian solutions of the bianchi type ix model with negative cosmological constant actually do exist , cf .",
    "fig.[class.traj ] ) .",
    "in the present paper we constructed exact quantum states for the diagonal bianchi type ix model with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "we found that the method presented in [ i ] for @xmath1 is indeed perfectly applicable to the model with @xmath3 .",
    "as for @xmath1 it gives five linearly independent solutions , which are generated by the chern - simons state using topologically different integration contours in the generalized fourier - transformation to the metric representation .",
    "imposing the condition that the wavefunction be normalizable on the caustic , just one wavefunction remains , that turns out to have some nice additional properties : it is found to be normalizable in minisuperspace in the distribution sense and it respects the symmetries of the bianchi type ix model .",
    "however , this state does _ not _ satisfy the no - boundary condition in the semi - classical limit in contrast to the case @xmath1 , and it turns out to predict a universe that never becomes lorentzian , after all .",
    "hence we obtain the result , that , _ if _ one allows for a non - zero cosmological constant at all , it should be positive , at least as far as the chern - simons functional related states of the quantized bianchi ix model are concerned .",
    "support of this work by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through the sonderforschungsbereich `` unordnung und groe fluktuationen '' is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "for completeness , and in order to obtain an important argument for the factor - ordering chosen for the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) , we shall make some comments on a further class of solutions , which can again be discussed by using the methods of [ i ] .    considering the wheeler - dewitt equation in the form ( [ 1.0 ] )",
    "one may ask , why we have not chosen a different factor - ordering , which is obtained by changing @xmath100 .",
    "this choice , of course , would not have affected the classical hamiltonian , but the quantum correction @xmath101 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) would have changed its sign .- representation introduced by kodama in @xcite , in contrast to the @xmath102-representation , which we have considered up to now .",
    "] since the coordinate transformation @xmath103 has exactly the same effect as the above mentioned change of the factor - ordering , it is possible to discuss the solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation in the new factor - ordering by considering still equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) , but substituting formally @xmath104 in the solutions . in the following",
    "it will be more convenient to use the coordinates @xmath21 and @xmath19 introduced in ( [ 1.4 ] ) and ( [ 1.4 + ] ) , which transform like @xmath105 under this substitution .",
    "it should be clear that the solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) are still of the form ( [ 1.2 ] ) , but while we looked at the cases @xmath106 in [ i ] and @xmath107 in the present paper , now the remaining sectors @xmath108 and @xmath109 are of interest , which , because of the formal substitution @xmath110 just mentioned , describe solutions for _ positive _ and _ negative _ cosmological constant in the _ new _ factor - ordering , respectively .",
    "it is easily checked that the location of the saddle - points , and therefore the caustic , depends only on @xmath111 defined in eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "this means that , irrespective of the sign of @xmath19 , we deal with the caustic of [ i ] in the case @xmath112 , and with the caustic fig.[grkaustik- ] in the case @xmath113 . on the other hand , it is just the sign of @xmath19 which decides whether the integration curves of [ i ] ( for @xmath114 ) or of fig.[grintc ] ( for @xmath115 ) give suitable integration contours .",
    "however , constructing the solutions for the new factor - ordering in this manner and applying the saddle - point method to the integral representation ( [ 1.2 ] ) in the limit of large anisotropy @xmath30 , it finally turns out , that _ any _ solution to the wheeler - dewitt equation in the new factor - ordering _ diverges _ for @xmath116 , at least in some @xmath30-sectors . in other words , in the new factor - ordering there is no solution which is normalizable in minisuperspace , not even in the distribution sense .",
    "furthermore , if the behavior of the wavefunctions on the caustic is considered , actually none of these solutions is found to be square - integrable with respect to @xmath30 .    comparing these results with the nice normalizability properties of the solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation in the factor - ordering of ( [ 1.0 ] ) presented in [ i ] and the present paper ,",
    "we believe to have a compelling argument to rule out the new factor - ordering . it would be interesting if this argument could be extended even to the general , inhomogeneous case of quantum gravity ."
