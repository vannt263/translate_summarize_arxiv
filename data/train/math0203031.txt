    "@xmath5 are infinite dimensional ind - varieties . these moduli spaces may be regarded as algebro - geometric analogues of a meromorphic loop group .",
    "the main results of this paper are :    1 .",
    "@xmath5 admits an algebraic poisson structure ( theorem [ thm - infinite - dimensional - poisson - moduli ] ) .",
    "the algebraic poisson structure coincides with the reduction of the one constructed by etingof and varchenko on a loop groupoid , using solutions of the classical dynamical yang - baxter equations ( theorem [ thm - comparison - with - cdybe - simply - connected - case ] ) .",
    "the symplectic leaves @xmath7 of @xmath5 are finite dimensional ( section [ sec - symplectic - leaves - folliation ] ) .",
    "their dimension is calculated in corollary [ cor - dimension - of - a - symplectic - leaf ] .",
    "the data @xmath8 , parametrizing the symplectic leaves , is a decorated divisor .",
    "it consists of a labeling , of finitely many points of the elliptic curve @xmath1 , by finite - dimensional irreducible representations of the langland s dual group ( i.e. , by orbits of the co - character lattice of @xmath0 , under the action of the weyl group ) .",
    "the symplectic leaves @xmath7 are algebraically completely integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "the generic lagrangian leaf is an abelian variety , which admits a precise modular description in terms of @xmath9-bundles on a branched @xmath10-cover of the elliptic curve @xmath1 ( theorem [ thm - general - complete - integrability ] ) .    en route , we prove that all smooth moduli spaces of simple sheaves , on an algebraic poisson surface , admit a poisson structure ( theorem [ thm - poisson - structure - on - moduli - of - sheaves - on - a - poisson - surface ] ) .",
    "this extends results of 1 ) s. mukai and a. tyurin , who constructed an anti - symmetric tensor on these moduli spaces @xcite , 2 ) s. mukai , and z. ran , who proved the jacobi identity for the mukai - tyurin tensor in the case of locally free sheaves on a symplectic surface @xcite , and 3 ) f. bottacin , who proved the jacobi identity in the case of locally free sheaves on a poisson surface @xcite .",

    "sections [ sec - orbits ] through [ sec - infinitesimal - study - of - m - infinity ] provide an algebro - geometric treatment of the poisson geometry and complete integrability of the moduli spaces @xmath5 . in section [ sec - hecke - correspondences ] we construct a poisson structure on the hecke correspondences over an elliptic curve . these are algebro - geometric analogues of orbits in the loop grassmannian . in section",

    "a particular case leads to a deformation of the elliptic calogero - moser system of type a.    we expect most of the results of the paper to go through in the degenerate case of a nodal or cuspidal rational curve ( a singular elliptic curve ) .",

    "we regard @xmath27 as a torsion sheaf on a projective surface ; the compactification @xmath28 $ ] of the total space of @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath20-action on @xmath26 extends to @xmath18 and @xmath18 has a @xmath20-invariant algebraic poisson structure , which is unique up to a scalar factor .",
    "we expressed the sklyanin poisson structure on the loop group , in terms of the deformation theory of the pairs @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the formula ( [ eq - psi - m - d ] ) , for the poisson structure in this paper , is a direct generalization of the formula in the @xmath22 case of @xcite .",

    "the formula of @xcite is a translation of the mukai - tyurin tensor , via the infinitesimal version of the above dictionary .",
    "we would like to stress the significance of the @xmath20-invariance of the poisson structure @xmath19 on the surface @xmath18 .",

    "the @xmath20-invariance , of the poisson structure induced by @xmath19 on the loop group , is equivalent to its _",
    "this is an analogue of the following simple observation : an algebraic poisson structure on a vector space @xmath30 is @xmath20-invariant , if and only if it has quadratic coefficients . in other words ,",
    "the weight @xmath31 subspace in @xmath32 is @xmath33 . a @xmath20-invariant algebraic poisson structure exists on the surface @xmath34 , with @xmath24 effective , if and only if the genus of @xmath1 is @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , a linear poisson structure exists for curves of arbitrary genus .",
    "consequently , the hitchin systems were constructed for a base curve of arbitrary genus , while the sklyanin systems exist only for a base curve of genus @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "the work presented here is a generalization , to arbitrary complex reductive groups , of the picture presented above in section [ sec - introduction - loop - group ] .",
    "half way through the project , we discovered ( thanks to a. polishchuk ) that our work is related to the classical dynamical yang - baxter equations ( cdybe ) , introduced by g. felder @xcite .",
    "etingof and varchenko interpreted solutions of the cdybe , with spectral parameter , as poisson structures on a loop groupoid @xcite .",
    "we hope to convince the reader , that the algebro - geometric approach to the subject provides new insight to the geometry of the cdybe . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "complete integrability of the etingof - varchenko poisson structures was not known for a general reductive group .",

    "elliptic solutions exist only for type a_. these solutions are related to factorization of the loop group .",
    "such factorizations arise from a rigid principal bundle on an algebraic curve @xcite . on a rational curve ,",
    "every trivial principal bundle is rigid . when the curve is elliptic , the only example of a rigid principal bundle , is the @xmath52 bundle coming from a stable vector bundle with rank and degree co - prime ( see @xcite theorem 5.13 ) .",
