    "symbiotic stars occupy an extreme and relatively poorly understood region of the binary classification scheme .",
    "the name was coined by merril ( 1941 ) to describe stars which appeared to have a combination spectra : that of high excitation lines usually associated with a hot , ionized nebula superimposed on a cool continuum with prominent absorption features consistent with a late  type star . at present",
    "they are understood to be interacting binaries ( with orbital periods of a few to tens of years ) consisting of a cool giant losing material mostly via the stellar wind and a hot , luminous compact object which ionises a portion of the cool component wind ( seaquist et al .",
    ", 1984 , hereafter the stb model ) .",
    "such a state of affairs represents the so  called _ quiescent phase _ , which can be interrupted by periods of activity .",
    "the _ active phases _ start with an eruption of the hot star , an event indicated photometrically by an increase of the star s brightness by 2 - 6mag , and/or spectroscopically by high velocity broad emission features from the central star .",
    "both radio and hst imaging can directly resolve the remnants of such dramatic events ( hack & parsece , 1993 ; eyres et al . 1995 ; kenny et al .",

    "the symbiotic star chcygni displays particularly complex behaviour .",
    "optical spectroscopic studies by mikoajewski et al ( 1987 ) showed that the orbits of the stars within the system are likely to be coplanar and eclipsing , with eclipses separated by around 5700 days .",
    "later studies ( mikoajewski et al , 1990 and references therein ) confirmed this period .    further spectral studies of the system ( hinkle et al .",
    "1993 ) suggested that chcyg is probably a triple - star system consisting of an inner 756-day period binary which is orbited by an unseen g - k dwarf on a 5300  day orbit .",
    "further photometric studies ( skopal et al . ,",
    "1996 ) discovered short , 756 day , period eclipses which show that all three stars in the system are likely to be in coplanar orbits .",

    "the drop in the optical magnitude of chcygni at the times of the long  period eclipses have been marked on this figure .",
    "each outburst was accompanied by high velocity broad emission features consistent with mass outflows . during 1984 - 85",
    "the material was ejected at @xmath2600 - 2500kms@xmath3 ( mikoajewski & tomov 1986 ) , whilst the 1992 - 95 active phase was characterized by sporadic and in part bipolar outflow at @xmath21000 - 1600kms@xmath3 ( leedjrv & mikoajewski , 1996 ; skopal et al . 1996 ; ijima 1996 ) and , finally , during the recent , 1998 - 2000 , outburst mass outflows at about 1000kms@xmath3 were observed ( paper ii ) .",
    "the outflows may be correlated with a significant increase of the radio emission and the radio light curves during these periods correlate well with the optical ones ( kenny et al .",
    "the 1984 mass ejection has been linked to emergence of bipolar emission which could be from either an expanding torus or collimated jets ( taylor et al .",
    "later radio observations revealed a complex morphology , although still exhibiting a bipolar structure ( kenny et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "in this paper we present radio surface brightness and spectral index maps taken from 15 years of observations of ch cygni by the very large array .",
    "ch cygni has been observed in the highest resolution `` a '' configuration several times with the vla since 1984 and multiple frequency observations were made on many of these occasions , four of which are detailed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "data reduction was carried out according to standard procedures using the aips software package ( greisen , 1999 ) .",
    "the flux density of the phase reference source was determined , and the data calibrated to correct phase and amplitude instabilities .",
    "these corrections were applied to the observations of ch cygni and a map produced by deconvolving the instrumental response ( the so - called `` dirty beam '' ) from the map using the well - established clean algorithm ( hgbom , 1974 ) . due to the low radio flux density of the source",
    "no self  calibration was possible .",
    "the maps were convolved with a beam size of 0.5@xmath40.5  arcsec at all observing bands .",
    "this size was the mean of the the major and minor axes of the beam at 5ghz , in order that comparison of the size and shape of features at different epochs would be meaningful .",
    "observations of the same object at different frequencies have a different @xmath5 plane coverage .",
    "this leads to features of different spatial scales being picked out at the different frequencies , causing problems when taking a ratio between two maps . in order to avoid this ,",
    "only the @xmath5 range covered by both sets of data was used to create the maps .",
    "this has the undesirable effect of decreasing the signal - to - noise ratio but does mean that the maps can be compared .",
    "the aips task `` comb '' was then used to produce a third map ( at a resolution of 0.17 arcseconds per pixel ) which traces the pixel  by  pixel spectral index variation .",
    "we use the convention that the radio flux at frequency @xmath6 , @xmath7 so that a positive spectral index ( @xmath8 ) represents an increase in flux with frequency .",

    "the spectral index of the central region had increased to @xmath13 as if @xmath14 , which can be attributed to the photoionised nebula dominating over the wind .",
    "such a value is predicted by the stb model for lower ionisation parameters .",
    "no extended emission is seen at 15ghz .",
    "this observation was made at a time when the optical activity was very low ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ulight ] ) and no outburst had been observed for some time .",
    "the 1995 cross - section has a peak of similar width to the other epochs in conjunction with bright thermal emission ( @xmath15 ) in the extension seen to the se of the central source in the 8.5ghz map in fig .",

    "this feature may be a result of local condensation in the mass flow .    in 1999 ,",
    "almost the entire emitting region has a negative spectral index , with a minimum of @xmath16 .",
    "this observation was made during what may be an eclipse of the inner symbiotic region by the outer giant ( skopal 1997 ) .",
    "this may have reduced the relative intensity of the thermal emission , suggesting that the thermal emission region was very compact at this time , i.e. similar in extent to the angular diameter of the outer red giant .",
    "the extensions detected in the radio surface brightness maps are more likely to be collimated jets rather than a torus .",
    "a torus is unlikely to appear so obviously one  sided , following an initial bipolar morphology .",
    "the non  thermal emission is suggestive of high velocity flow , commonly associated with jets but not with a circumbinary torus .",
    "it may be that the extended emission is due to a large nebula , with a radius of order 100au , which has been photoionised between 1985 and 1986 . from the stb model , for suitable parameters ( @xmath17k , @xmath18yr@xmath3 ( skopal et al . , 1996 ) , @xmath19=20  km  s@xmath3 ( vogel et al . , 1994 ) ) it is clear that the ionised cavity due to the hot component will be density bounded and much smaller than the binary separation .",
    "the hipparcos distance to ch cygni is @xmath20  pc ( viotti et al . 1998 ) , meaning that the maximum extent of the @xmath21 contour of radio emission at 15ghz in 1986 is @xmath22au . the most likely origin of of extended non  thermal emission is synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in a magnetic field .    if ch cygni follows the model proposed for hm sagittae by eyres et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , then what is being observed are regions of shocked material , caused when high velocity ejecta expand into the relatively dense circumtrinary envelope created by the winds of the giant stars in the system .",
    "evidence for this scenario comes from infrared spectroscopy ( taranova & yudin , 1988 ) , carried out around the period of the end of the optical outburst in 19831987 , showing changes in the circumtrinary dust envelope .",
    "they suggested that the dust was disrupted at the time of the radio jet emergence , probably as it was swept up by the expanding matter .",
    "the positions of the nw and se extended knots were measured on the 1986 15ghz radio map .",
    "the angular separations between the peak in each knot and the central bright peak were    @xmath23    and    @xmath24    for the nw and se knots respectively .",
    "the greater uncertainty in the se position is due to the fact that the se component has lower surface brightness than the the nw one . in a 1985 vla 15ghz map ( fig .",
    "[ fig:85 ] ) , these two knots were not visible , and hence the material must have been ejected within 422  days before the 1986 observation .",
    "this places a lower limit on the expansion velocity . assuming a distance to ch cyg of @xmath25  pc the velocities are found to be    @xmath26    for the nw component and    @xmath27    for the se component , with the uncertainties dominated by the uncertainty on the hipparcos distance .",
    "these results correspond well with those derived previously , in particular with the expansion velocity of 1400  km  s@xmath3 derived from two earlier maps ( taylor et al .",
    "1986 ) that were separated by only 75 days .",
    "the upper limit of the surface magnetic field of a typical white dwarf is around @xmath28 g ( bond and chanmugam , 1982 ) . assuming a dipole geometry ,",
    "this will fall off as @xmath29 . for a stellar radius of 0.01r@xmath30",

    "existing cool wind is likely to be much less than the jet speed , as a typical cool giant wind has a velocity of the order of 2040 km  s@xmath3 ( vogel et al .",
    "the non  thermal emission is then caused by particle acceleration at the resulting bow shock , as the local magnetic field is compressed and enhanced and electrons are accelerated to velocities close to @xmath32 . in such an environment , the local azimuthal field ,",
    "@xmath33 is defined by equation 42 of bode & kahn ( 1985 ) the density of the shock , the temperature of the giant wind ( assumed to be constant at @xmath34k ) and the mean particle mass which is taken to be the proton mass . the shock is assumed to be strong and totally ionised , so that the shock density is equal to 4 times the density of the unshocked wind at this distance from the star . it is assumed that the disruptions caused to the giant wind by the hot component prior to mass ejection are negligible at this distance so that a uniform , spherical radial wind exists .",
    "the denisty of the wind is proportional to the mass loss rate of the giant , @xmath35 ( skopal , 1996 ) . if the unshocked wind speed , @xmath36 is taken to be the escape velocity of the red giant , assuming @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( skopal 1997 ) then @xmath39 and @xmath40  mg .",
    "another magnetic field estimate can be derived from the technique used in studying high energy extragalactic sources .",
    "the total energy of a radio source is split between that of the electrons , the protons and the magnetic field . at equipartition ,",
    "the magnetic energy is approximately equal to the particle energy ( pachoczyk , 1970 ) , and the ratio of energy carried by protons to that carried by electrons is @xmath41 . for a radio source of known angular dimensions and depth , assuming an ellipsoidal geometry , the magnetic field under equipartition , @xmath42 , can be found using the method described by miley ( 1980 ) .    to make use of this model",
    ", one needs to determine several parameters that describe the region : filling factor , @xmath43 ; the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight , @xmath44 ; the flux density of the emitting region , @xmath45 , at frequency @xmath6 ( ghz ) and the maximum and minimum frequencies of radio emission ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 repectively , in ghz ) from the source spectrum .",
    "the filling factor would be more useful in extragalactic work when it would be expected that there would be unresolved blobs of emitting material . since the measured sizes of the knots in the extended emission are of a similar angular size to the beam , @xmath48 .",
    "the angle @xmath44 is important due to the fact that the radiation observed is beamed from electrons moving towards the observer .",
    "the fact that eclipses are seen in the system means that the orbital plane of the stars is observed edge  on .",
    "bipolar jets are believed to be aligned with the rotation axes of their parent star ( perpendicular to the orbital plane ) so the jets of ch cygni are believed to lie almost in the plane of the sky ( crocker et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , @xmath49 .",
    "the cutoff frequencies of the radio emission , @xmath50 and @xmath46 are taken to be 0.01ghz and 100ghz respectively ( miley , 1980 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is the main unknown in this equation as the exact details of the mechanism leading to synchrotron emission are not known .",
    "a value of @xmath51 would be appropriate for the electrons being produced following collisions in a circumstellar medium ( pacholczyk 1970 ) , but a value of @xmath52 is more consistent with the minimum energy requirement ( miley 1980 ) .",
    "however , since @xmath53 only depends upon @xmath54 , having @xmath41 100 times larger would only increase @xmath42 by a factor of 3 .    in order to determine the size of the jet bullets",
    ", two dimensional gaussians were fitted to the emitting regions in the nw and se jets .",
    "the depth was then found by assuming that the regions exhibited cylindrical symmetry along the axis of ejection .",
    "for the nw jet , @xmath55 arcsec , @xmath56 arcsec and @xmath57 au .",
    "the se jet had dimensions of @xmath58 arcsec , @xmath59 arcsec and @xmath60 au . using the mean value of the spectral index in the jets of @xmath61 ,    @xmath62    for the nw jet and    @xmath63    in the se .",
    "these values are comparable to that found above from the physics of the shock , so there is sufficient magnetic field in the enhanced regions for synchrotron radiation .      since the total luminosity of this region at all frequencies is not known , determining the lifetime of the emission due to all radiative energy losses is impossible .",
    "in addition to this , synchrotron loss processes may be dominant . under the influence of a magnetic field @xmath53",
    ", an electron rotates at the gyrofrequency ( rybicki & lightman , 1979 ) and the frequency of radiation , @xmath6 , is a factor of @xmath64 higher than the gyrofrequency , so manipulating equation 6.4 of rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) gives @xmath65 .",
    "an electron with this lorentz factor has energy @xmath66 and radiates with power @xmath67 so that the lifetime of the synchrotron radiation is @xmath68 and with the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 from above , @xmath71 seconds , corresponding to just under 1500 years .",
    "such a timescale would imply that synchrotron radiation would be very long - lived in the circumstellar material , assuming that the magnetic field compression is sustained by continuous matter injection .",
    "when there is no matter injection the magnetic field can expand adiabatically and the synchrotron emission will fade within years .",
    "no non - thermal emission is seen in 1988 .",
    "if indeed there is no synchrotron emission at this epoch , some other loss - mechanism must be occurring .",
    "the optical light curve of figure [ fig : ulight ] shows 1988 to be a particularly quiet period , over two years after the last major outburst .",
    "it is therefore likely that there is no matter being ejected into the circumstellar wind , so that no new density enhancements and magnetic field compressions are being formed .    supporting evidence for this scenario comes from optical spectral observations . during this epoch ,",
    "the blue continuum was very faint and the balmer lines were not present ( bode et al .",
    "1991 ) , strongly implying that there were also no fast winds or jets at this time .",
    "hence one would not expect to detect shock phenomena resulting from penetration of high  velocity material into circumbinary material and , by this model , no non  thermal emission from recently ejected material .",
    "previously , unambiguous non  thermal emission in symbiotic stars had only been seen in hm sge ( richards et al .",
    "spatially resolved non  thermal emission is very rare in any stellar source , and is only seen regularly in very high  energy systems such as micro - quasars .",
    "a potential non  thermal feature in r aqr was subject to such large errors ( @xmath72 ) that its status could not be confirmed ( dougherty et al .",
    "other symbiotic stars are believed to exhibit entirely thermal radiation .",
    "ch cyg displays the strongest evidence yet of non  thermal emission due to jet  wind interaction .",
    "ch cyg and hm sge share the property of having undergone outbursts in relatively recent history .",
    "the above arguments suggest that non  thermal emission will decrease rapidly with time after the outburst if the field strength and high energy particles are not continuously replenished as discussed initially in richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . since",
    "the 1984 - 86 ejections in ch cygni two outbursts have been observed which may have injected further high velocity material into the circumstellar environment and hence given rise to the non - thermal emission seen in the 1995 and 1999 observations .",
    "there is definite evidence of non  thermal emission in the ejecta from ch cygni .",
    "this , together with a morphology consistent with high velocity jets , supports the scenario of taylor et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , rather than one where the extension is a result of an expanding circumstellar torus .",
    "the proposed mechanism for the creation of the non - thermal emission involves material ejected in high velocity bullets interacting with a previously expelled lower velocity stellar wind .",
    "the ejected matter creates shocks in the circumstellar medium , leading to locally enhanced magnetic field density , particle acceleration and synchrotron emission .",
    "we suggest that the presence of non  thermal emission in symbiotic stars may be an indicator of outbursts associated with significant ejecta .",
