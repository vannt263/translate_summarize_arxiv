    "broad absorption lines ( bals ) are observed in the uv spectra of about 10 - 20% qsos and taken as an important indicator for the central engine of qsos .",
    "bal carries only information of the bal region along the line of sight to the continuum source while the global information is contained in the scattered polarized light .",
    "bal qsos are the only highly polarized population among radio quiet qsos .",
    "ogle et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied the polarization of 36 bal qsos and found : position angle(pa ) rotation in the bals , blueshifted bals in polarized flux relative to that in total flux spectra and deficit of polarized flux redward of the bals . in order to explain these features we perform a monte - carlo simulation to calculate resonant and electron scattering for radial outflows of two different geometries : equatorial and funnel - shaped outflows with and without rotational velocity",
    "we refer the readers to wang et al.(2005 , 2007 ) for details .",
    "we present our results in fig 1(left ) for rotated outflow with geometry similar to elvis(2000 , his figure 3 ) . in an axisymmetric model , pa rotation in the bals can be produced only when the outflow carries angular momentum .",
    "the pa rotation increases with the angular velocity as well as the subtending angle of the flow . in order to produce a pa rotation @xmath0 10observed in a few bal qsos ,",
    "subtending angle of the outflow should be larger than 25 .",
    "similar requirement is imposed to explain the red deficit of polarized flux observed in some bal qsos .",
    "if the subtending angle of outflow is larger than 25the polarization plane of back - scattered light is perpendicular to that of continuum and the polarization vectors of the light redward of the bal cancel , giving a deficit of polarized flux(wang et al .",
    "2007 ) . assuming the electron scattering region(for example the shielding gas , murray et al .",
    "1995 , proga et al .",
    "2000 ) is cospatial with the outflow , we calculate the effect of electron scattering to the polarization in bals . because of rotation of the outflow and similar size of two scattering regions , the electron scattered light fill the trough at @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the rotational velocity of outflow at the launching radius , and the bal in polarized flux is blueshifted relative to that in the total flux , just as shown in fig .",
    "1(right ) .",
    "we also find resonantly scattered light will contribute a significant part of nv line that is widely used to determine the metal abundance of qsos .",
    "for an equatorial outflow the maximum ratio between the equivalent width(ew ) of the scattering emission to the bal ew increases from 11% to 18.6% if the covering factor of balr increases from 20% to 40% .",
    "the scattering emission of nv is even stronger because of the scattering of the strong ly@xmath3 emission line .",
    "therefore , a strong nv may not indicate a high metal abundance but a large covering factor of the balr(wang et al .",
