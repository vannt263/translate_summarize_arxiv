    "sound production in organ pipes is traditionally described as a generator - resonator coupling . in the last decades",
    ", research has been concerned with the complex aeroacoustic processes which lead to a better understanding of the sound generation in a flue organ pipe .",
    "the process of sounding a flue - type organ pipe employs an airstream directed at an edge , the labium of an organ pipe .",
    "an oscillating `` air sheet '' is used to describe the situation in which the oscillations of the jet exiting from the flue are responsible for the creation of the pipe sound @xcite . using the `` air sheet '' terminology ,",
    "it is pointed out that the oscillation is controlled not by pressure , as in earlier investigations @xcite , but by the air flow @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes more involved if two flue organ pipes are close in sounding frequency and in spatial distance .",
    "then a synchronization of the pipes , a frequency locking , occurs @xcite .",
    "this has a direct importance for the arrangement of organ pipes in a common orgelwerk .",
    "the effect has been known by organ builders for a long time and taken into account intuitively in the design of organs @xcite .",
    "some measurements of the acoustic field or of its dependence on the mutual coupling or on the distance between the pipes have been reported first in the early 20th century @xcite , but no theoretical explanation was given .",
    "in this article , we report acoustic measurements and give a possible explanation by means of modern synchronization theory @xcite . to a certain approximation",
    ", an organ pipe can be considered as a self - sustained oscillator , explained in detail below . in this context , the synchronization of a pipe by an external , acoustical force is important , such that we carried out additional measurements , where a pipe stands aside a loudspeaker whose frequency is tuned around the pipes pitch . as well in this case",
    ", the pipe is found to be synchronized .    as a side result of these measurements",
    ", we can clarify a discussion about the nature of the strong amplitude decrease for two coupled pipes , already observed by lord rayleigh @xcite and later by very detailed measurements of bouasse @xcite . as a possible interpretation",
    ", the so - called oscillation death has been given in @xcite , which means that there is an oscillation breakdown at the the pipe mouth , and all the energy is dissipated . from our results , we rule out such a scenario and suggest an antiphase oscillation which yields destructive interference of the emitted acoustic waves .",
    "this holds for two neighboring pipes , as well as for the pipe standing aside a loudspeaker .",
    "this article is structured as follows : in section [ sec : basics ] we explain briefly the generation of sound in an organ pipe and review basic concepts from synchronization theory . in section [ sec : experiment ] we report on detailed measurements of the synchronization of a loudspeaker positioned directly on the side of a pipe and observe two adjacent pipes .",
    "the results are interpreted within the frame of synchronization theory .",
    "we give an explanation of why a model of two oscillators works out so well , as indicated in @xcite .",
    "further , the dependence of the frequency spectrum on the distance between two detuned pipes is investigated for a fixed amount of detuning .",
    "finally , we conclude with section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "sound generation in organ pipes has been repeatedly investigated @xcite . here ,",
    "the beauty of musical sound generation is paired with complex aerodynamical phenomena ; their coupling to the acoustic field has been understood to a reasonable degree in the last 30 years ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a single organ pipe : the wind system blows with constant pressure producing a jet exiting from the pipe flue .",
    "typical reynolds numbers , corresponding to a free jet are of the order of @xmath0 , depending on the pressure supplied and the pipe dimensions , see @xcite .",
    "the jet exiting from the flue generates a pressure perturbation at the labium of the pipe which travels inside the pipe resonator and is reflected at the end of the resonator .",
    "this pressure wave returns after time @xmath1 to the labium where it in turn triggers a change of the phase of the jet oscillations .",
    "after a few transients , a stable oscillation of an `` air sheet '' at the pipe mouth is established .",
    "this oscillation of the wind field couples to the acoustic modes and a sound wave is emitted .",
    "thus , the system can be considered as a damped linear oscillator ( the resonator ) which controls the periodic energy supply of the air - jet by the air column oscillation .",
    "we want to adapt this idea of an organ pipe as a self - sustained oscillator @xcite to understand the mechanism of mode- or frequency locking @xcite , or synchronization .",
    "one feature of a self sustained oscillator is the occurence of oscillations even for constant driving .",
    "the physical mechanism is the balance of energy losses and energy input .",
    "the classical example is the van der pol oscillator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vdp ] ) , where a triode ( or more modern , a tunnel diode ) acts as `` negative resistance '' whose response is fed back to an electrical oscillator . in the case of an organ pipe ,",
    "energy is supplied by the wind system , losses are due to internal dissipation in the spatially extended resonator , and radiation .",
    "the negative resistance is represented by the air stream at the pipe mouth and the feedback coupling is given by the boundary conditions between the `` air sheet '' wind field and the air - column oscillations in the resonator .",
    "it can be described by impedances @xcite , detailed results for two coupled helmholtz resonators are given in @xcite .",
    "of course , the exact form of the limit cycle and thus the acoustic oscillations depend on the details of energy losses , as the quality factor of the resonators , the radiation of sound , and the understanding of the energy supply by the coupling to the jet .",
    "the general mechanism , however , remains untouched , since only a nonlinear growth of losses and supply is needed for a self - sustained oscillator to work .",
    "here , we do not want to investigate these details , but rather emphasize the general character of our investigations .",
    "+    the sound emitted by this complex system can be evaluated by the coupling of the flow and the acoustic modes in the framework of aeroacoustic modeling on the basis of lighthills analogy . according to howe @xcite ,",
    "the sound generation is dominated by the singularity at the edge of the labium .",
    "numerical approaches still suffer from the very expensive runs needed to resolve the large range of excited scales and the proper choice of boundary conditions @xcite .      in his book , lord rayleigh states",
    "`` when two organ pipes of the same pitch stand side by side ... it may still go so far as to cause the pipes to speak in absolute unison in spite of inevitable small differences '' @xcite .",
    "he describes the so - called `` mitnahme - effekt '' ( loosely the take - along effect ) , known by organ builders @xcite . in @xcite the phenomenon is interpreted in the frame of synchronization theory .",
    "hereafter we will use the terms frequency locking or synchronization to be synonymous with the `` mitnahme - effekt '' . in @xcite ,",
    "the effect has been analyzed heuristically , while stanzial has investigated the dependence of the frequency locking on the detuning or frequency difference of two single pipes in @xcite by acoustic measurement .",
    "he modeled the effect by two coupled oscillators , without giving a physical reason of the coupling .",
    "a treatment of the mode - locking phenomenon , specific for musical instruments is very nicely given in @xcite . in the following",
    "we will rely on synchronization theory to show that _ any _ self - sustained coupled oscillator generically shows synchronization .",
    "probably the most important feature of self - sustainment is the occurrence of an attracting limit cycle .",
    "it appears due to two properties : nonlinearity , and the energy balance between losses and driving . for a linear ,",
    "damped oscillator a limit cycle solution does not exist , the only possible attractor is the trivial solution .",
    "nonlinearity allows for the dependence of frequency on amplitude which constitutes a mechanism to drive the system towards an amplitude at which the regular oscillations are established .",
    "since the amplitude corresponds directly to the mechanical energy of the system , this is right at the point of equality of losses and supply  the limit cycle .",
    "we want to sketch the principles for synchronization of an oscillator with an external driving and then explain the interaction of two oscillators . in the following",
    "we will discuss some equations in terms of the angular frequencies and return later to frequencies when the measurements are concerned .",
    "+ let us consider the equation for a harmonic oscillator with negative , nonlinear resistance : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the angular frequency of the harmonic system and @xmath4 is a nonlinear function with at least one part of positive and another part of negative slope .",
    "now we discuss the basic principles by the concrete example of the van der pol oscillator and give general results without further derivation , for details see @xcite . in the case of the van der pol oscillator @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the energy supply is accounted for by @xmath7 , the losses by @xmath8 .",
    "if the inharmonicity is not too great , the amplitude on the limit cycle differs little from the harmonic oscillator and the phase coincides approximately with the harmonic one . to get rid of fast oscillations ,",
    "one applies the method of averaging @xcite : one inserts for the amplitude @xmath9 and collects terms of the different time scales 1 and @xmath3 .",
    "so , one obtains an equation for the slowly varying amplitude @xmath10 , and for the phase @xmath11 here for the van der pol oscillator . @xmath12",
    "[ eq : sve11 ] describes the slow relaxation of the amplitude towards the steady state .",
    "a limit cycle exists for @xmath13 .",
    "the solution of the phase equation allows for the addition of an arbitrary constant phase .",
    "thus , one can shift the state along the cycle without changing the energy .",
    "this allows for the adjustment of the phase , when the system is driven , or coupled to another oscillator .",
    "this adjustment is exactly what we understand as synchronization , or mode - locking .",
    "+ if the system is driven externally by a harmonic force with angular frequency @xmath14 , two time scales are present in the system , a fast one @xmath15 , and a slow one @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . the corresponding equation @xmath18 we want to investigate now the dependence on the slow time and average over the fast one",
    "to do so , we use the ansatz @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the slow phase ( it is a bit easier working with a complex amplitude , substituting @xmath21 ) . by using again the averaging method one obtains after a few straightforward steps @xcite @xmath22 the second equation",
    "is known as the adler equation @xcite ; the general form for the phase equation depends on the nonlinear function @xmath4 and can be seen as the difference of the equations for the two fast variables @xmath23 , and @xmath3 : @xmath24 with a @xmath25-periodic function @xmath26 , and the two parameters detuning @xmath27 and locking term @xmath28 , which is proportional to the driving strength . to zero order",
    ", one can assume @xmath29and the phase equation effectively decouples from the amplitude equation , which in turn is driven by the phase , similar holds for a first order @xcite .",

    "let us turn to the phase dynamics outside the synchronization region . for @xmath47 , one can formally integrate eq.([eq : adler ] ) to obtain @xmath48 the period @xmath49 results with the integration bound @xmath50 .",
    "the total phase rotates uniformly @xmath51 and one recognizes the typical beat phenomenon , as for the superposition of two harmonic waves ; only that here the beating is strongly nonlinear . for harmonic oscillations",
    "the phase - slip of the beating is distributed over the whole interval .",
    "close to the bifurcation from the synchronized region , one observes long epochs of nearly constant phase @xmath52 broken by relatively short intervals in which the phase rotates by @xmath25 .",
    "we observe this behavior as well for coupled organ pipes , this is illustrated below by a plot of the measured time signal close to the synchronized region .    for a saddle - node bifurcation , one expects a square root dependence of @xmath53 on the detuning @xmath54 .",
    "this indeed by expansion of the denominator in ( [ eq : time ] ) : @xmath55 a very detailed description , including many examples and generalizations is given in @xcite .",

    "as the pipes come closer to each other , the individual , sharp peaks of half width @xmath104 0.1 hz reduce in amplitude and at the same time the spectrum broadens to a `` hump '' with half width @xmath105 hz .",
    "peaks typical of the beating from linear superposition sit on the hump .",
    "coming even closer , full synchronization is observed with one single , very sharp peak of again half width @xmath106 hz .",
    "that means the hump is about ten times broader than either of the peaks for the uncoupled system or the synchronized one .",
    "the basic observations can be explained by synchronization theory . in eq .",
    "[ eq : snbif ] , the square root behavior of the frequency difference at the transition to synchronization ( the bifurcation point ) is derived .",
    "lowering the coupling strength is equivalent to shift the bifurcation point towards zero . at a certain distance",
    "the detuning leaves the synchronization region and one should observe a ( strongly nonlinear ) beat .",
    "the peaks of the beat are observable as small side peaks on top of the broad peak . for a pure beat , only sharp peaks should be observed . here",
    ", the duration of the large time interval -we do not want to call it period- varies slightly such that the sidebands wiggle a bit , altogether this leads to a broad peak . to illustrate this behavior , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : humptime ] three different time signals for the distances ( synchronized ) , ( shortly before synchronization ) , and .",
    "the fast oscillations look very similar for all of the distances , as exemplary given by fig .",
    "[ fig : humptime ] ( bottom , right ) .        a complete understanding why such a broad hump appears could not be achieved .",
    "there are several possible explanations .",
    "according to classical synchronization theory the frequency fluctuation can not be explained but by noise , e.g. in the air supply in the wind system .",
    "another option are the small fluctuations in the vortices at the pipe mouth which can be sufficient to cause the very small variation in the beat frequency .",
    "finally , one can consider the bifurcation to synchronization as a kind of phase transition , where typically large fluctuations occur , including chaotic behavior . by means of our measurement",
    "we can not decide which of these scenarios is true .",
    "finally , we want to mention recent results concerning whistling of two nearby helmholtz resonators show a similar transition in the phase of the acoustical signals emitted by the resonators @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the phase relation is lost at distances of the order of the ones we find ( 25 mm , if the wall thickness of the pipes is included ) .",
    "thus , this observation might be explained by synchronization as well .",
    "we presented measurements on an external driving of an organ pipe by a loudspeaker and on the mutual influence of two organ pipes .",
    "the observed behavior is completely consistent with an explanation in the frame of synchronization theory . for the dependence of the synchronization on the `` coupling strength '' ,",
    "measurements determining the dependence of the frequencies on the inter - pipe distance have been carried out .",
    "they reveal a broadening of the peak at the synchronization frequency with increasing distance .",
    "this broadening can be explained by quick phase slips as predicted by theory close to a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the smearing out of the side peaks of this beat can be either due to inconstant wind supply or due to the fluctuations caused by the oscillating air sheet at the pipe mouth . to clear this question further measurements have to be carried out .    from an acoustic point of view , one can address the question of how to position two organ pipes close in frequency .",
    "this has been intuitively solved by organ builders by trial and error in the last centuries @xcite .",
    "our work might give quantitative hints on how large the inter - pipe distance needs to be to suppress mutual influence , and on details of the coupling mechanism .",
    "for example , avoiding an amplitude minimum for the first harmonic is highly desirable .    from an aerodynamical point of view",
    ", the above scenario requires more detailed investigations to understand the full dynamics of the coupled resonator / jet system , although a model consisting of two mutually coupled oscillators seems to be sufficient for all qualitative questions .",
    "in addition the more involved setup of more than two organ pipes is an interesting subject for further investigations . from our measurements",
    ", one can clearly say that the pipes do not show an oscillation death ; rather , antiphase sound radiation yields the observed weakening of the amplitude .",
