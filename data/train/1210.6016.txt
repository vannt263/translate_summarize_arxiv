    "in contrast , the thomson scattering of photons by free electrons acts within the ionized part of the symbiotic stars environment , and thus can diagnose the symbiotic nebula . in the spectrum",
    ", we can indicate this effect in the form of shallow , wide wings of the strongest emission lines , which photons are scattered by free electrons , and thus are doppler shifted by their thermal motion to both the red and blue side of the line .",
    "the effect of this process is weak and wavelength independent , because of a very small and constant value of the thomson cross - section , @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "nevertheless , the densest portions of symbiotic nebulae with electron concentrations of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 in @xmath1 ) , could be optically thick enough to cause a measurable effect of the electron scattering . from this point of view",
    ", strong emission lines of highly ionized elements that are formed in the densest part of the ionized medium in a vicinity of the hot white dwarf , represent the best candidates .",
    "originally , @xcite suggested that the broad wings of the o  1032 and 1038  resonance lines could be explained by scattering of the o  photons by free electrons .",
    "@xcite successfully compared a model of the electron scattering wings with the o  doublet in the ag  dra spectrum .",

    "thomson scattering represents a special case of the scattering of a photon off a free electron , which is fully elastic ( i.e. the photon energy does not change ) . in the real case",
    ", the photon always transfers some of its energy to the electron , which shifts its wavelength by @xmath27 + 0.024   , the so - called compton wavelength of the electron .",
    "however , the doppler effect arising from the thermal motion of free electrons leads to significantly larger shifts to both sides of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , the elastic thomson scattering is a good approximation in studying scattering of low - energy photons ( @xmath28 ) off non - relativistic electrons ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * in detail ) . to model the effect of the electron scattering we have to know how the scattered photons are redistributed in frequencies and directions .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that it is convenient and sufficiently accurate to regard the radiation field , from which scattering occurs , as isotropic , so that the direction can be averaged out .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity , we consider isotropic scattering with maxwellian distribution of electron velocities . under these assumptions",
    "the redistribution function can be expressed in a form @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are frequencies of radiation before and after the scattering and @xmath32 is the electron doppler width , @xmath33 and the complementary error function @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 to calculate the electron - scattering wings profiles , we adopted a simplified scheme of @xcite , which assumes that a plane - parallel layer of free electrons of the optical thickness @xmath2 and the temperature @xmath3 is irradiated by the line photons , and that the electrons are segregated from the other opacity sources , which implies no change in the equivalent width of the line . in our case , this assumption corresponds to modelling the wings of highly ionized o  and he  lines , which are formed within the o@xmath36 and/or he@xmath37 zone close to the hot white dwarf photosphere , and the layer of free electrons , where the thomson scattering arises , is located above the line formation region .",
    "according to the radiative transfer equation , assuming that the electron scattering is the only process attenuating the original line photons , the observed line flux can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the line flux before scattering , @xmath40 is the electron optical depth and @xmath10 is the column density of free electrons along the line of sight . as the scattered fraction of the original flux",
    "is redistributed into the line wings so that the equivalent width before and after the scattering is constant , @xmath41",
    ". then the line profile after it emerges from the layer of scattering electrons may be approximated by ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the incident line profile , @xmath44 is the redistribution function for thomson scattering ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) and @xmath45 or @xmath46 is a frequency displacement from the line center in units of electron doppler width before and after the scattering , respectively .",
    "so , the first right - side term of eq .   represents the original flux at @xmath45 attenuated by the scattering ( eq .  ) , and its scattered , @xmath47 , fraction is redistributed in the wings ( the second term ) .",
    "note that the scattered profile used previously by e.g. @xcite represents a special case of eq .   for @xmath48 .    to fit the theoretical profile ( [ eq : psi ] ) to observations , means to determine its variables , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and those of the incident profile @xmath43",
    "first , we estimated the continuum level from a large wavelength interval around the o  lines by a linear fit to the noise in the spectrum . in the case of the he  1640  line ,",
    "the continuum level was estimated with the aid of the corresponding low - resolution spectrum .",
    "second , we approximated the incident profile @xmath49 in the model ( [ eq : psi ] ) as follows .",
    "the he  1640  line was possible to fit with a single gauss curve .",
    "the fit of the observed emission core provided the first estimate of its position , width and the height .",
    "the o1032  line is in most cases asymmetric with respect to its reference wavelength .",
    "its blue emission wing is steeper than the red one , being cut by an absorption component ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : in ] ) .",
    "it is probably caused by the scattering in the line at the close vicinity of the white dwarf within the densest part of the wind moving to the observer .",
    "this absorption can be more pronounced during active phases , when a higher mass - loss rate is observed @xcite .",
    "the observation of ag  dra from 2007 may 15 , made during the 2006 - 08 active phase , is consistent with this view ( see the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : in ] ) .",
    "the scattering in the line operates within the line formation region .",
    "therefore , we take the incident profile of the o1032  line as a sum of emission and absorption gaussians .",
    "the incident emission of the o  1038  line was not possible to reconstruct by a direct fitting of its observed remainder , because of a strong influence by the absorption of the interstellar molecular hydrogen , @xmath50 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . therefore , we reconstructed the incident o  1038  profile with the aid of the theoretical ratio of the doublet lines with the assumption that they have the same width ( see below ) .",
    "based on the above mentioned observational properties of the o1032,1038  doublet , we reconstructed its incident profile by a superposition of three gaussians , @xmath51 ,   \\label{eq : fi}\\ ] ] where indices n = 1 and 3 denote the gaussians of the emission cores at @xmath52  and @xmath53 . the second curve ( n = 2 ) represents the absorption component , which cut the blue side of the 1032  emission line ( fig .  [ fig : in ] ) .",
    "however , this rather strong absorption did not reproduce the narrow one seen in the scale of figs .  [",
    "fig : agmod ] and [ fig : zmod ] as a p - cyg component in the 1032  line , but not recognizable in the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : in ] . only for the v1016  cyg spectrum , due to a symmetrical emission core of the 1032line , it was possible to fit this narrow p - cyg absorption by the @xmath54 component ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : zmod ] ) .",
    "irrespectively of its origin , we neglected its influece to the profile .",
    "the effect of the interstellar @xmath50 absorption to the o1038  line profile was significant in the spectra of z  and and v1016  cyg , because of a large amount of interstellar matter on the line of sight to these objects ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "as a result , the observed intensity ratio @xmath56 was @xmath57 for z  and and @xmath58 for v1016  cyg .",
    "therefore , we reconstructed the original o1038   line adopting the theoretical ratio @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 so to fit the emission remainder of the line .",
    "the absorption effect from the @xmath50 molecules was apparently fainter on the ag  dra spectra ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , and thus the estimate of the initial o1038  line profile was more trustworthy .    some spectra show a noticeable additional emission features at the red side of the 1032  and 1038  line cores up to @xmath64% of their height .",
    "we did not investigate the origin of these features and did not take them into account in the fitting procedure .",
    "however , in the ag  dra spectrum from 2007 march , the unknown emission features were rather strong .",
    "therefore , we included them to the incident o  1032,1038  line profiles as an additional gaussians ( see fig .",

    "this increases the electron concentration in the ionized zone by a factor of @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the abundance by number of he relative to h. following derivation of @xcite , but replacing the terminal velocity of the wind , @xmath121 , by its @xmath22-law distribution @xmath122 where @xmath123 is counted from the centre of the cool giant with the radius @xmath124 (= the beginning of the wind ) , we can express the terms of eq .",

    "fig : tfi ] ) .    having",
    "defined the ionization structure in the binary , we can calculate the function @xmath115 by integrating the electron concentration throughout the ionized zone along the line of sight to the hot star , i.e. @xmath142 where the electron concentration @xmath143 and @xmath144 is the density of hydrogen atoms in the wind from the giant .",
    "if the line of sight is not passing through the neutral region , @xmath145 ( in practice we adopted @xmath146 ) .",
    "to calculate correctly @xmath115 for ag  dra , we considered its orbital inclination @xmath147 @xcite . the function @xmath115 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tfi ] .",
    "a maximum value of @xmath2 ( @xmath270.03 ) is around @xmath148 , when the line of sight passes the ionization region as an asymptote to the boundary ( the direction b in the figure ) .",
    "a minimum of @xmath270.007 corresponds to the position with the hot star in front ( @xmath149 ) , because of the lowest densities of the wind from the giant .",
    "figure  [ fig : tfi ] demonstrates that theoretical @xmath115 function is significantly below the values derived from observations during quiescent phases ( crosses in the figure , table  2 ) .",
    "this implies that the ionized fraction of the unperturbed wind from the giant is not capable of producing the observed electron scattering wings .    in a more realistic case the density distribution in a binary with mass - losing giant",
    "is determined mainly by the rotation of the binary and accretion by its compact companion , as was demostrated by several hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these studies",
    ", it was shown that the regions with highly increased density around the accretor , around the mass - losing star and the whole binary , and behind the accretor ( opposite to its orbital motion ) were in the form of a disc , a spiralling arm and an elongated accretion wake , respectively . as a result",
    ", the column density of free electrons in the direction to the accretor can be enriched by the ionized material accumulated at / around the accretion disk at each position of the binary .",
    "additional extremes can be expected for highly inclined orbits , when the line of sight passes throughout a higher density structure ( see e.g. fig .  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "a lower orbital inclination smooths out the density contrasts at different phases ( see fig .  2 of * ?",
    "* ) . accordingly ,",
    "in the real case , the faint electron - scattering wings during quiescent phases with @xmath150 can be caused mainly by free electrons from / around the accretion disk and the ionized wind from the hot star , which corresponds to the total column density , @xmath151@xmath9 .",
    "the presence of the latter was proved by more authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is well known that during active phases the hot stars in symbiotic binaries enhance significantly the mass - loss rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ejected material is ionized by the luminous central hot star , which thus enhances radiation from the symbiotic nebula .",
    "for example , @xcite derived a factor of @xmath15210 stronger nebular emission in the continuum during active phases with respect to values measured during quiescence .",
    "the enhanced mass - loss rate from the hot star thus represents a significant supplement of free electrons into the nebula . as a result , the electron optical depth , @xmath40 ,",
    "will be considerably larger during active phases ( table  2 ) . here ,",
    "this is well documented by the series of the ag  dra spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : agmod ] ) .",
    "the model sed demonstrates that the nebular radiation dominates also the spectral region of the photometric @xmath153 filter ( see top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) . therefore , the level of the ag  dra activity is well mapped with the @xmath153 light curve ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : agmod ] ) , which thus explains the relationship between @xmath2 and the star s brightness in @xmath153 ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "a large scatter around @xmath154 is probably connected with the transition phase , when the nebula can be partially optically thick in the continuum .",
    "we can conclude that during active phases the large values of @xmath155 ( i.e. @xmath156@xmath9 ) are caused by a supplement of free electrons into the binary environment as a result of the enhanced mass - loss rate from the hot star .",
    "we investigated the effect of thomson scattering of the strong emission lines , o1032 , 1038  and he1640 , observed in the spectra of symbiotic stars ag  dra , z  and and v1016  cyg .",
    "our models of their profiles are in good agreement with those observed by _ fuse _ , _ befs _ , _ tues _ and _ iue _ satellites ( figs .  [",
    "fig : agmod ] and [ fig : zmod ] ) .",
    "this supports the idea that the broad wings of these lines result from the scattering of the line photons on free electrons .",
    "their profile is given by two fitting parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( table  2 ) , which characterize the scattering region , i.e. the symbiotic nebula .",
    "particular results of our analysis can be summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   the presence of the electron scattering wings in the line profiles of highly ionized elements locates their origin mostly to the vicinity of the hot star in the binary , with the highest density on the line of sight .",

    "this findings agrees well with quantities derived independently by modelling the sed .",
