    ", we wish to concentrate on item number three and the outstanding question : how can one experimentally determine the neutrino mass hierarchy ?",

    "a positive value of @xmath6 implies @xmath12 and a so - called normal mass hierarchy , while a negative value of @xmath6 implies @xmath13 and a so - called inverted mass hierarchy .",

    "[ normal_inverted ] .",
    "the question of whether the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal or inverted is of considerable theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "for example , one can argue on general grounds that grand unified theories favor a normal neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "this may be understood qualitatively by noting that grand unified models relate leptons to quarks , and the quark mass hierarchies are normal .",
    "an inverted neutrino mass spectrum , on the other hand , would be quite un - quark like , and would probably reflect an underlying global leptonic symmetry ( see @xcite and references therein ) that gives rise to the near degeneracy of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is easy to understand , qualitatively , why the current data are unable to distinguish positive from negative @xmath6 .",
    "almost all information we have on @xmath6 comes from @xmath16 disappearance at atmospheric experiments and k2k .",
    "these provide information on the @xmath16 survival probability @xmath17 , which is given ( in vacuum ) by @xmath18 modulo terms proportional to @xmath19 or @xmath3 .",

    "hence both a normal and an inverted mass hierarchy fit the data equally well .    in this paper , we explore several different oscillation probes of the neutrino mass hierarchy , and discuss under what conditions these can be experimentally accessible .",
    "more specifically , we concentrate our efforts on probes other than `` matter - affected 13 oscillations , '' which have been heavily explored in the literature and are defined and very briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : traditional ] .",
    "to date , all phenomenological studies of how to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy via neutrino oscillations have , to the best of our knowledge , relied on a non - zero value for @xmath3 , and almost all appeal to matter effects in the 13 sector .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to argue that neither matter effects nor a nonzero value of @xmath3 are required in order to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy via neutrino oscillations  at least in principle .",
    "there are many reasons for pursuing novel oscillation probes of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "one is that we would , ultimately , like to compare distinct determinations of the mass hierarchy .",
    "such a comparison provides a test of whether there is new physics in the lepton sector besides three flavor oscillations .",
    "another ( and , perhaps , the most important ) reason for pursuing different hierarchy - exploring channels is that , if @xmath1 turns out to be too small , the traditional approach will not work , so new experimental probes are not only desirable but absolutely necessary !    our presentation is the following . in sec .",

    "our approach is `` theoretical , '' in the sense that we study the behavior of oscillation probabilities as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath26 and the baseline @xmath27 instead of the expected number of observed events for a given neutrino beam , detector type , size , resolution , etc .",
    "nonetheless , our approach allows one to estimate `` how precise '' certain measurements need to be so that the inverted and normal mass hierarchy lead to experimentally distinct results .",
    "one very promising way of revealing the character of the neutrino mass hierarchy is to probe oscillations which are significantly affected by matter effects in the 13 sector @xcite . in this section ,",

    "is often not enough to experimentally determine the mass hierarchy .",
    "this is due to a well known @xmath1mass hierarchy degeneracy , which can be understood in the following way .",

    "the degeneracy described above can be broken by more experimental information .",
    "simple ways of determining the mass hierarchy include comparing @xmath34 and @xmath44 at @xmath54 ( which can be done with one detector and both muon - neutrino and muon - antineutrino beams ) , or comparing measurements of @xmath34 at @xmath54 for different values of @xmath27 ( which requires two different detectors , but only muon - neutrino beams ) .",
    "another way is to independently measure @xmath55 precisely enough such that one can statistically distinguish between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "other probes of the neutrino mass hierarchy that depend on matter effects and a nonzero @xmath3 include precise atmospheric neutrino studies @xcite and measurements of the neutrino flux emitted during a nearby supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "the procedures referred to above do not take advantage of the fact that , in the case of three neutrino flavors , neutrino oscillations are governed by two distinct oscillation frequencies . indeed , extracting the neutrino mass hierarchy via matter affected 13 oscillations works perfectly well even in the limit @xmath58 , when solar effects become utterly unobservable @xcite .",
    "all procedures referred to above , however , rely fundamentally on a nonzero value of @xmath3 and neutrino oscillations in matter . in the next two sections",
