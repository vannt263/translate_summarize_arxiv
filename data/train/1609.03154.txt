    "cataclysmic variables ( cv ) are semi - detached binary systems which consists of a white dwarf ( wd ) primary surrounded by a keplerian disc accreted from a roche lobe - filling late - type secondary star . in systems where the mass transfer is high ( @xmath10  m@xmath6  yr@xmath11 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the disc will become steady and remain bright for longer periods , suppressing the typical outbursts of cvs with lower mass transfer .",
    "these systems are commonly referred as _ nova - like variables _ ( nl ) .",
    "@xcite constructed an initial qualitative description of nl systems which possess v - shaped eclipses , single - peaked lines and lags between the photometric and spectroscopic ephemeris , known as sw sex stars .",
    "recently , this list of properties had been revised in order to account for an increasing variety of systems ( including non - eclipsing ) that share similar traits .",
    "furthermore , sw sex stars seem to be the dominant population of systems with orbital periods around 3 - 4 hr @xcite and their possible connection to nova eruptions may provide information in the general context of cv evolution @xcite .",
    "1rxs j064434.5 + 334451 ( hereinafter j0644 ) is a bright object ( @xmath1213.3 ) , discovered during the northern sky variability survey by @xcite ( nsvs 7178256 ) , was initially identified as a @xmath13 lyrae object by @xcite , but they point out that @xcite ( hereinafter s07 ) have identified the object as a deep - eclipsing cv with an orbital period of nearly 6.5 hr .",
    "the latter authors present the first spectroscopic and photometric study of this object and derive radial velocity semi - amplitudes for the primary and secondary stars , from which they obtained a mass ratio @xmath14 , and individual stellar masses in the range 0.63 - 0.69 @xmath15 for the white dwarf and 0.49 - 0.54 @xmath15 for the late  type star .",
    "they found that this nova  like resembles a ux uma or a sw sex type object .    in this paper",
    ", we present new spectroscopic and simultaneous photometry of j0644 . we revisit the ephemeris of the system based on new observed eclipses , whose shapes are discussed in detail .",
    "we discuss the radial velocity measurements of the balmer h@xmath16 and the high - excitation he@xmath1ii @xmath17 emission line .",
    "we present doppler tomography reconstructions , calibrated with the simultaneous photometry .",
    "finally , a discussion is made on the classification of the object among the cvs , which point out towards the group of the sw sex  type stars .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy was performed at the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir , mexico , on 2008 january 915 .",
    "these were taken using the echelle spectrograph and the site3 ccd detector at the f/7.5 cassegrain focus of the 2.1 m telescope .",
    "exposures of 600s were used to obtain a resolution of @xmath180.025 in orbital phase .",
    "the log of spectroscopic observations is presented in table  [ tab : spectralog ] .",
    "we covered a full orbital period on most nights except on january 12 , 14 & 15 , when we focused the observations around the primary eclipse .",
    "a th - ar calibration lamp was used every ten object images in average .",
    "the range in spectral coverage is @xmath193980  7050  with an average spectral resolution of @xmath20 kms@xmath11 .",
    "standard iraf procedures were used to reduce the data .",
    "no flux standard was observed since we were focused on obtaining radial velocities from the data .",
    "heliocentric corrections have been applied . in figure",
    "[ fig : average ] , we present the spectrum of j0644 which shows strong he@xmath1i , he@xmath1ii and hydrogen balmer lines in emission . *",
    "occasionally , we observe narrow absorption lines similar to those presented by s07 . *",
    ".log of spectroscopic observations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "s07 found the strongest evidence of the donor by performing cross  correlations with several standard stars with spectral types k3k5 .",
    "although we see several weak absorption lines , most of these features are masked by the bright emission arising from the accretion disc during most of the orbit .",
    "thus , we were unable the find a consistent solution to the radial velocities .",
    "we created an average spectra around phase zero , where the absorption lines are most likely to observed ( see figure  [ fig : average ] ) .",
    "the spectrum is consistent with a k0v star .",
    "the usual lines for spectral classification like fe@xmath1i@xmath21 4250 , 4260 , 4271 and cr@xmath1i lines @xmath21 4254 , 4274 , 4290 as well as ca@xmath1i @xmath22 4226 , are too weak to be seen in this heavily masked spectrum due to the presence of the strong blue continuum .",
    "we have therefore resorted to a direct comparison with the k0v star @xmath23 draconis and compared the region 4900 - 5250 , wich is shown in the blow - out segment at the bottom of the figure .",
    "it is well known that secondary stars in cvs tend to have larger radius than main sequence stars for a given mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , obtaining its mass from the spectral type or a mass - radius relation is not straightforward ( the mass of a k0v is @xmath24 , * ? ? ?",
    "using empirically calibrated relations , we can estimate a donor mass m@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , this relationship is uncertain above 0.6 , hence we favour the dynamical measurement of k@xmath26 obtained by s07 in our mass estimate in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "nevertheless , both methods give similar results , within the errors .",
    "doppler tomography provides a method to obtain insight on the structure of the accretion disc , seen through a particular emission and/or absorption line @xcite .",
    "they are created in velocity space and careful interpretation is needed to infer the physical position from where they are emitted .",
    "we used a code developed by @xcite based on the maximum entropy method .",
    "we calibrated the spectra using the @xmath27 johnson simultaneous photometry to account for slit losses .",
    "an average of the simultaneous photometric data , was performed , covering exactly each spectroscopic exposure and then summed all the spectral fluxes centred at 5380  with a width of 98  .",
    "then , we obtained a @xmath27 johnson - like flux ( not convolved with the filter spectral response ) .",
    "the spectra were then calibrated accounting for the difference between photometric and spectroscopy magnitudes and correcting accordingly .",
    "doppler maps were thus obtained for the emission lines h@xmath0 and he@xmath1ii 4686  ( figure [ fig : doppler ] ) .",
    "+    the balmer h@xmath0 tomogram shows an emission region with a maximum at ( @xmath28,@xmath29)@xmath30(+200,-300 ) kms@xmath11   and a bright spot close to the secondary star ( near the l1 point ) . in the higher contrast map ( bottom row of figure  [ fig : doppler ] ) , this spot appears connected with the larger region at negative @xmath29 velocities .",
    "the h@xmath31 tomogram ( _ center panels _ ) presents a more extended emission region , ranging from ( @xmath32,@xmath33)=(-200,-700 ) kms@xmath11   to ( @xmath32,@xmath33)=(500,0 ) kms@xmath11 . the high excitation line he@xmath1ii @xmath17 ( _ right panels _ ) is seen in the tomogram as a single blob of material around or close to the wd centred at ( @xmath28,@xmath29)= ( + 0,-200 ) kms@xmath11 .",
    "these tomograms are consistent with previous studies on nl - type systems @xcite .    at phase @xmath34 ,",
    "the balmer lines are visible even tough the system undergoes deep eclipses .",
    "a minimum is found at phase 0.125 ( consistent with the tomography ) , and in fact show a double peak throughout phase 0.375 as different parts of the large emission is occulted . in general , the balmer lines present a complex but similar behaviour during the full cycle .",
    "the blue - shifted peak in both lines is more intense throughout phase 0.0 to 0.25 , probably due to the strength shown in the tomography at the negative @xmath28 part of the elongated emissions .",
    "there is a clear double speak at h@xmath0 present at phases 0.375 and 0.75 , phases at which we would expect to see the hot spot near the secondary more clearly and separated from the blob in its less elongated position .",
    "we most stress that the high - excitation he@xmath1ii @xmath224686   is always present as a single peak at all phases , although weaker near phase zero .",
    "the he@xmath1ii line shows a minimum at phases 0.0 to 0.125 , but does not disappear completely .",
    "this suggests that the blob we are looking in the tomogram may surround completely the central wd and may arise from outside the orbital plane , but is could also be the results of seeing the extended weaker emission shown in the lower right tomogram of figure  [ fig : doppler ] ) .",
    "accurate masses of cvs are difficult to obtain , even in eclipsing systems , since it is rarely possible to look directly at the wd . instead , we rely on the radial velocity curve of the emission lines arising from the accretion disc , which can posses asymmetries that may lead to inaccurate results .",
    "furthermore , the surface of the secondary star could be irradiated and the measurements from its absorption lines could give an out of center of mass radial velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "these problems have been discussed in full by @xcite , although modern studies with high resolution spectroscopy have proven useful in de - convolving these asymmetries , as in the case of u gem @xcite .    our radial velocity analysis of j0644 clearly indicate that the disc has large asymmetries , as shown in the balmer line .",
    "this is consistent with the findings by s07 , particularly with their results for the he@xmath1i @xmath35 line in absorption ( see their fig .",
    "our doppler tomography shows that the balmer emission comes from a large , but asymmetric region located on the far side of the accretion disc with respect to the secondary .",
    "we must point out , however , that our observations do not show the strong central absorption in the h@xmath1i and he@xmath1i lines observed by s07 .",
    "we must therefore assume that the accretion disc was at a different state .",
    "however , the he@xmath1ii tells us another story . while s07 ascribe the bulk of the he@xmath1ii emission coming from in inner - disc , our doppler tomography results indicate that the he@xmath1ii emission arise from a concentrated region around the white dwarf .",
    "nevertheless , these two interpretations should not affect the @xmath36 value .",
    "the s07 results for the he@xmath1ii line gives @xmath37 kms@xmath11 , compared with our results of @xmath38  kms@xmath11 .",
    "we point out at a strong difference between our figure  [ fig : prim_vel ] and s07 figure 11 . in both cases",
    "the positive radial velocities reach a maximum of about 100 @xmath39 . however , our maximum negative velocities reach about @xmath40  kms@xmath11 , while in s07 they go no further than @xmath41  kms@xmath11 .",
    "s07 measured the centre - of - wavelength , from each line profile to calculate the doppler velocity of h@xmath1i , he@xmath1i and he@xmath1ii lines .",
    "they found , in general that the radial velocity curve from these lines ( in absorption and emission ) present a flat bottom from phases 0.0 - 0.5 , which they attribute to line blending , magnetic effects , non - uniform disc emission or effects from an accretion stream .",
    "they also claim that he@xmath1ii in emission is exempt from this non - sinusoidal behaviour .",
    "this may not be so .",
    "although the solid line in their figure 11 is a sinusoidal , this may be misleading , as the radial velocity measurements do seem to be affected by this flattening behaviour between phases 0.1 to 0.4 .",
    "the cause of this effect may be due simply to the way their individual spectra was measured .",
    "the centre - of - wavelength approach may result in distorted radial velocities .",
    "this method may not be the cause _ per se_.",
    "it is possible that the asymmetric bulk may play a role in this distortion in both h@xmath1i and he@xmath1i lines , when at these phases , the bulk is behind the white dwarf .",
    "but it is also possible that we have observed the system at a different accretion stage and the flattening may be due to a stronger distortion in both h@xmath1i and he@xmath1i lines . this possibility is supported by the fact that we do not observe the strong central absorption in the h@xmath1i line .",
    "we must also point out that our h@xmath1i radial velocity curve does not suffer from this flattening effect .",
    "if anything we observe an excess of negative radial velocities at phase 0.25 . if our arguments are correct , then our he@xmath1ii radial velocity should reflect more accurately the motion of the white dwarf .",
    "this value is also supported by our doppler tomography ( see section [ sec : doppler ] ) , which indicate that the centroid of the velocity he@xmath1ii blob has a velocity around @xmath42  kms@xmath11 .",
    "s07 estimates a semi - amplitude of the secondary of @xmath43 kms@xmath11 .",
    "we will use the latter in our estimates of the orbital parameters .",
    "therefore , we can establish an independent mass ratio of @xmath44 .",
    "we adopted our improved orbital period , @xmath45 d to estimate the mass functions :    @xmath46    @xmath47 and @xmath48    assuming an inclination angle of @xmath49 , the system parameters are :    @xmath50 @xmath51 + @xmath52 @xmath51 + @xmath53 @xmath54 , +    where the errors reflect both the masses and inclination angle uncertainties .",
    "at these high inclination angles , the error produced by its uncertainty is small and the results are dominated largely by the error in the masses and the separation of the binary .",
    "our results yield larger masses for both the primary and secondary stars ( within the uncertainties ) than the upper limits given by s07 .",
    "the separation of the binary is also slightly larger than that estimated by s07 .",
    "however , these purely dynamical measurements provide a mass of the wd in line with the average mass of cvs @xcite .",
    "the mass of the donor is in agreement with the expected value from semi - empirical evolutionary sequences @xcite , as calculated in section  [ sec : donor ] .",
    "although we detected the narrow absorption features mainly in the balmer lines , around phase 0.5 , we were unable to reproduce the results of s07 , due do the lack of the appropriate spectra .",
    "s07 used two spectra taken at phases -0.0788 and -0.0177 and subtracted them with the purpose to find if the spectrum of the wd reveals itself .",
    "what they found is a spectrum ( see their figure 11 ) with strong narrow absorption lines of h i , he@xmath1i , mg@xmath1ii and ca@xmath1i , instead of the broad features expected from a white dwarf .",
    "they concluded that the region producing this spectrum could arise from a region containing the wd and an inner - accretion disc , or could be the result of some newly formed pre - wd .",
    "our doppler tomography of h@xmath0 and he@xmath1ii @xmath224686  , suggest that this absorption spectrum is the result of the accretion stream overflow ( i.e. the disc regions detected through the balmer lines ) seeing at large optical depths against the bright inner regions around the wd ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this supports the explanation by s07 that we are looking at a region with deep h@xmath1i and he@xmath1i absorption lines with a black body temperature of about 25,000 k.      j0644 exhibits most of the characteristics of an sw sex type star , as defined originally by @xcite .",
    "it is a nova - like cv showing deep primary eclipses and a high inclination system .",
    "it displays high excitation lines including he@xmath1ii @xmath22 4686  .",
    "it shows single peak emission lines , instead of the double - peaked emissions expected from near - edge - on discs .",
    "it shows shallower balmer lines during primary eclipse and also transient absorption lines around phase 0.5 .",
    "two characteristics of the sw sex stars do not comply for j0644 .",
    "it has an orbital period way outside the 34 hr criteria and it does not exhibit pronounced radial velocity phase offsets with respect to phase zero , as defined by the eclipses .",
    "there are now several new found cv s with large orbital periods like bt  mon , v363  aur , ac  cnc and ls  peg definitely confirmed as sw  sex systems , plus a number of possible candidates .",
    "therefore , this last criteria might be only a selection effect , as it should be the criteria of having only eclipsing system in order to belong to this group .",
    "our doppler tomography shows that the balmer lines are produced in j0644 by elongated and strong emissions , located opposite the secondary star with respect to the center of mass of the binary .",
    "this is similar to the doppler tomography found in bh  lyn @xcite",
    ". a small phase shift could be produce if the main emitted material is located opposite the secondary star .",
    "another case that shows a concentrated emission at different parts of the disc is the case of bf  eri @xcite shows also a small phase lag .",
    "we have improved the ephemeris of the object through differential photometry .",
    "a slow and short brightening of @xmath55  0.4  mag was observed in 2008 .",
    "our radial velocity analysis allowed us to obtain values for the semi - amplitudes of both components of the system .",
    "doppler tomography revealed the he@xmath1ii emission arises from the wd and is a good indicator of its radial velocity semi - amplitude . from our adopted values for @xmath4 , @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ", we find @xmath50  m@xmath58 ; @xmath59  m@xmath58 and a separation of the binary @xmath53  r@xmath58 .",
    "we found that the general characteristics of j0644 are consistent with a sw sex nova - like cv .",
    "follow  up observations , specially simultaneous spectroscopy and photometry , are needed to better understand the nature of this object .",
