    "the intensity of synchrotron radio emission from shock - heated electrons in star - forming galaxies is known to be correlated tightly with their fir emission from dust grains heated by the interstellar radiation field ( see the review by condon 1992 ) .",
    "this fir  radio correlation arises because both radiation processes are connected with the rate of ongoing high - mass star formation activity in a galaxy .",
    "the correlation links the flux densities of a galaxy in both the 60- and 100-@xmath0 m _ iras _ passbands and at a frequency of 1.4ghz in the radio waveband . a reasonable pair of template spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , which describe dusty galaxies at the relevant frequencies",

    "radio correlation can be combined to predict the faint counts of radio galaxies .",
    "the predicted count of galaxies brighter than 10@xmath0jy at 8.4ghz is 0.8arcmin@xmath1 , in agreement with the observed value of @xmath2arcmin@xmath1 ( partridge et al .",
    "1997 ) .    the slope of the sed changes abruptly at a wavelength of about 3 mm , at which the dominant contribution to the sed changes from synchrotron emission to thermal dust radiation .",
    "because the fir  radio correlation links the flux densities on either side of this spectral break , it could be exploited to indicate the redshift of the galaxy ( carilli & yun 1999 ) .",
    "carilli & yun calculated that the radio  submm flux density ratio of a distant dusty galaxy , which lies on the fir ",
    "radio correlation , should be @xmath3 as a function of redshift @xmath4 . @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 are the spectral indices of the sed , @xmath7 , in the radio and submm wavebands .",

    "@xmath6 is the sum of the rayleigh - jeans spectral index ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 , the spectral index in the dust emissivity function @xmath12 .",
    "carilli & yun ( 1999 ) also derived empirical flux density ratio ",
    "redshift relations from the seds of arp220 and m82 .",
    "the spread of the redshift values that correspond to a fixed flux density ratio across their four models corresponds to an uncertainty @xmath13 .",
    "the sensitive 850-@xmath0 m scuba camera at the jcmt ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) has been used to detect high - redshift dusty galaxies ( see blain et al .",
    "1999a and references within ) .",
    "these are probably the high - redshift counterparts to the low - redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , and so their seds might also be expected to follow the fir  radio correlation . in this case",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the observed radio and submm - wave flux densities of five dusty galaxies are used to predict their redshifts in table1 .",
    "this technique provides a coarse indication of the redshift of these five galaxies , which all lie at spectroscopic redshifts within the bounds of the range of predictions made by carilli & yun s four models .",
    "what are the systematic effects that limit the reliability of the inferred redshifts ?",
    "the fir  radio correlation is based on observations of a range of low - redshift galaxies ; low- and high - luminosity spiral galaxies , irregular star - forming dwarf galaxies and ulirgs .",
    "one factor that could modify the general properties of the seds of high - redshift dusty galaxies is the @xmath17 increase in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from its value at @xmath18 . however , unless the dust temperature @xmath19k this is unlikely to have a significant effect on the sed if @xmath20 .",
    "the details are discussed in more detail by blain ( 1999a ) .",
    "the increasing temperature of the cmb has another effect . above a certain redshift",
    "the energy density in the cmb exceeds that in the magnetic field in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the observed galaxy .",
    "synchrotron radio emission will thus be suppressed due to the cooling of relativistic electrons by inverse compton scattering of cmb photons .",
    "carilli & yun ( 1999 ) estimate that this will typically occur for ulirgs at @xmath21 , and at @xmath22 for the lesser magnetic fields in the ism of the milky way .",
    "this effect is not included in the results presented here ; however , this potential deficit in the radio flux density from high - redshift galaxies should be borne in mind .",
    "galaxies with a range of different dust temperatures @xmath23 lie on the fir  radio correlation .",
    "this is because the fir flux densities involved in the correlation are at wavelengths close to the peak of the sed of a typical dusty galaxy .",
    "hence , shifting the position of the peak of the sed , by changing @xmath23 , makes little difference to the integrated fir luminosity and thus to the fir  radio flux density ratio .",
    "however , in the submm waveband , the effect of modifying either the dust temperature @xmath23 or the emissivity index @xmath11 is much greater , as shown by the five different model seds in fig.2 .",
    "three different dust temperatures @xmath24 , 40 and 60k are included , each with an emissivity index @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , the sed is calculated for a @xmath26k model with @xmath27 and 2.0 .",
    "-5 cm    the predicted forms of the submm  radio flux density ratio as a function of redshift for all five template seds are shown in fig.3(a ) .",
    "the results of carilli & yun ( 1999 ) , calculated using equation ( 1 ) , are also shown for comparison .",
    "carilli & yun s equation provides a good description of the 1.4-ghz:850-@xmath0 m flux density ratio if @xmath28k .",
    "however , because the positions of the curves in fig.3(a ) are quite different if @xmath29k , the redshift that would be assigned to a cooler galaxy using the 1.4-ghz:850-@xmath0 m flux density ratio alone is uncertain .",
    "this is true even if the fir  radio correlation is assumed to be free from any intrinsic scatter , and if any additional contribution to the radio flux density from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is neglected .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the fir ",
    "radio correlation is about 0.2dex , and so because the power - law index of the lines in fig.3(a ) is about @xmath30 at @xmath31 , an additional 0.1dex ( @xmath32per cent ) uncertainty would be expected .",
    "see carilli & yun ( 1999 ) for a discussion of the effects of any agn component , which should lead to a conservatively low redshift estimate .",
    "it is interesting to replot the curves in fig.3(a ) as a function of the combined redshift  dust temperature parameter @xmath33 .",
    "this is the quantity that is constrained by measuring the position of the peak of the thermal dust emission component of the sed by combining observations in the fir and mid - infrared ( mir ) wavebands .",
    "the results are shown in fig.3(b ) . because the radio flux density is produced by a non - thermal emission mechanism , a measurement of the radio  submm flux density ratio might be expected to break the degeneracy between temperature and redshift . however , because the differences between the curves in fig.3(b ) are not much greater than the scatter in the fir ",
    "radio correlation , the degeneracy remains .",
    "the ` redshifted dust temperature ' of a galaxy , @xmath34 , can be determined by measuring the frequency of the peak of the fir dust component of the sed ( see figs1 and 2 ) , but @xmath4 and @xmath23 can not be determined independently .",
    "locating the peak frequency requires both long and short wavelength observations : see blain ( 1999b ) and hines ( 1999 ) elsewhere in this volume .",
    "spectral features produced by emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules and atomic fine - structure lines in the restframe mir waveband ( see fig.1 ) could be exploited to obtain photometric redshifts for distant galaxies ( xu et al .",
    "1998 ) . at shorter wavelengths , the prospects for obtaining photometric redshifts using the 310@xmath0 m _ sirtf",
    "_ irac camera have been discussed recently by simpson & eisenhardt ( 1999 ) .",
    "photometric redshifts deduced from these features will not be subject to the @xmath23@xmath4 degeneracy .",
    "the identification of an optical counterpart to a submm - selected galaxy usually requires a radio observation and a great deal of observing time ( see for example ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) . the optical magnitudes and colours of heavily - obscured submm - luminous galaxies",
    "are expected to extend over wide ranges , and so the derivation of redshift information from broad - band optical photometry will probably require careful individual analysis of each submm - selected galaxy .",
    "photometry and spectroscopy of likely optical counterparts to submm - selected galaxies ( smail et al .  1998 ; barger et al .",
    "1999 ) indicate that the ratios of 850-@xmath0 m and optical @xmath35-band flux densities are scattered by about an order of magnitude across the sample .",
    "radio observations of submm - selected galaxies are crucial in order to make reliable optical identifications .",
    "the ratio of the radio and mm / submm - wave flux densities also provides information about the redshift of the galaxy ( carilli & yun 1999 ) .",
    "however , the temperature and emissivity of dust in distant galaxies has a very significant effect on the ratio of the submm - wave and radio flux densities , and so for reasonable values of the dust emissivity and temperature , this ratio can not be used to break the degeneracy between the dust temperature and redshift of a distant dusty galaxy .",
