    "`` a basic requirement of continuum mechanics is that interpenetration of matter does not occur , i.e. that in any deformed configuration the mapping giving the position @xmath0 of a particle in terms of its position @xmath1 in the reference configuration be invertible '' .",
    "j. m. ball @xcite .",
    "it is then a natural question to ask what systems of equations , among those used as models for elastostatics , give rise to invertible solutions when reasonable boundary conditions are prescribed .    in this note",
    "we shall prove by an example that the lam system of isotropic , linearized elasticity in the plane , with _ constant _ lam coefficients , may lead to physically unacceptable solutions , because interpenetration of matter occurs .",
    "let us recall here that the same phenomenon was previously found by fosdick and royer ",
    "carfagni @xcite for a more involved anisotropic linear system , by elaborating on an example due to lekhnitskii @xcite . in higher dimensions",
    "similar phenomena occur . from the mathematical point of view",
    "a basic example is due to de giorgi @xcite . in all these examples , however , a basic common feature is the presence of some sort of point singularity in the solution itself ( in dimension greater than two ) or at least in the gradient in any dimension .",
    "such a singularity can only be present when the coefficients of the elliptic system are irregular , for instance discontinuous .",
    "our examples are different from those previously known in several ways , but the most crucial difference is that we choose smooth and in fact _ constant _ coefficients in our systems .",
    "therefore our examples , besides bringing a new argument to the many already well known , see for instance ciarlet @xcite and the references therein , about the limitations of linearized elasticity , shed some new light on the tightness of certain classical properties enjoyed by harmonic mapping showing that they can not be easily extended even within the class of constant coefficient systems .",
    "we now recall some fundamental properties of planar harmonic mappings , see the book of duren @xcite for a very broad treatment of this subject .",
    "we begin with the classical theorem of rad , kneser and choquet .",
    "this theorem which was first stated by rad @xcite , proved by kneser @xcite immediately after and then independently rediscovered by choquet @xcite , remains the basic unequalled result of invertibility for mappings solving an elliptic system of equations .",
    "let @xmath2 be an open disk in the plane , let @xmath3 be a homeomorphism of @xmath4 onto a simple closed curve @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the solution to the dirichlet problem @xmath7 let @xmath8 be the bounded region such that @xmath9 .",
    "the rad  kneser ",
    "choquet theorem states the following .    if @xmath8 is convex , then @xmath10 is a homeomorphism of @xmath11 onto @xmath12 .",
    "the main reasons why this theorem remains substantially unequalled are    \\(i ) no analogue of this theorem holds true in dimension three or higher , as it was shown by a striking example by laugesen @xcite , see also melas @xcite ,    \\(ii ) the convexity assumption on the target domain @xmath8 is optimal .",
    "in fact , it is known since choquet @xcite , that if @xmath8 is not convex then there exists homeomorphisms @xmath13 , for which the injectivity of @xmath10 , the solution to ( [ rado ] ) , fails .",
    "see also @xcite for a thorough investigation of this issue .",
    "nevertheless various kinds of generalizations of the rad  kneser  choquet theorem have been obtained .",
    "regarding harmonic mappings between manifolds , see schoen and yau @xcite and jost @xcite . for mappings @xmath10",
    "whose components solve a linear elliptic equation , let us mention bauman , marini and nesi @xcite and also @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , in these last two papers the rad  kneser  choquet theorem has been extended to linear elliptic equations in divergence form with merely bounded measurable coefficients . for quasilinear equations of the @xmath14-laplacian type see @xcite .    as a remarkable special case of our theorem [ generale.th ] , which will be stated here below , we prove that no analogue of the rad ",
    "choquet theorem holds when the diagonal laplacian system is replaced by a lam system with constant moduli of the following form @xmath15 more precisely , we have the following .",
    "[ main.th ] let @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "there exist a disk @xmath19 , a bounded convex domain @xmath20 and a smooth diffeomorphism @xmath21 , so that the unique solution @xmath22 to @xmath23 is _ not _ a homeomorphism of @xmath2 onto @xmath8 .    note that the natural unknown for the lam system , should be the _ displacement _ field @xmath24 , rather than the _ deformation _ field @xmath10 .",
    "however , due to the fact the the identity mapping @xmath25 is also a solution of the lam system , we have trivially that @xmath24 solves the lam system if and only @xmath26 solves the same system .",
    "this is the reason why in theorem [ main.th ] it is understood that the solution @xmath10 is representing a deformation field .    in remark [ more ]",
    ", we shall see that the solution fails to be an homeomorphism in a very strong way , in fact @xmath10 maps @xmath2 onto a domain larger than @xmath8 , moreover it folds itself along a curve , across which the orientation is reversed .",
    "our next theorem is a far reaching generalization of the previous one .",
    "it shows that the rad ",
    "choquet theorem holds only if one deals with elliptic systems _ of diagonal form with the same scalar elliptic operator on both components_. we need some definitions .",
    "consider a constant coefficients second order elliptic system of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath8 are @xmath29 real constant matrices , and the unknowns @xmath30 and @xmath31 are real valued functions .",
    "we say that the system ( [ gen.syst ] ) is elliptic if it satisfies the legendre ",
    "hadamard condition @xmath32 this condition is weaker than the strong convexity condition , namely the positivity of the @xmath33 matrix given in block form as @xmath34 and , as it is well known , ellipticity is the same as rank one convexity of the quadratic form associated to @xmath35 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.3 ) .",
    "we note that there is no loss of generality in assuming that the matrices @xmath36 and @xmath8 are symmetric .",
    "we shall say that the system ( [ gen.syst ] ) is _ equivalent _ to the system @xmath37 if there exists a non - singular @xmath29 matrix @xmath38 such that @xmath39    [ generale.th ] let the ellipticity condition ( [ ell-1 ] ) be satisfied .",
    "the following alternative holds .",
    "either    \\i ) the system ( [ gen.syst ] ) is equivalent to the system @xmath40    or    \\ii ) there exist a disk @xmath19 , a bounded convex domain @xmath20 and a smooth diffeomorphism @xmath21 , so that the unique solution @xmath41 to @xmath42 is _ not _ a homeomorphism of @xmath2 onto @xmath8 .",
    "the above results show that one of the most basic properties enjoyed by planar harmonic mappings can not be extended to other elliptic systems in the plane .",
    "it is then natural to ask similar questions for another fundamental property of injective harmonic mapping .",
    "a benchmark of the theory is a result of h. lewy @xcite proving that harmonic homeomorphisms are , in fact , diffeomorphisms .",
    "more precisely we have the following result .",
    "[ lewy.th](h . lewy . )",
    "lut @xmath43 be a harmonic mapping .",
    "if @xmath10 is invertible , then @xmath44    also in this case the validity is limited to two dimensions .",
    "j. c. wood @xcite found a third degree polynomial harmonic mapping which provides a counterexample in dimension three . on the positive side ,",
    "hans lewy @xcite recognized that , in three dimensions , if @xmath10 is the _ gradient _ of an harmonic function and it is a homeomorphism , then it is a diffeomorphism .",
    "this result was extended to any dimension in the remarkable paper by gleason and wolff @xcite . in a different direction , several generalizations of lewy",
    "s theorem have been achieved in dimension two when the components of @xmath10 satisfy the _",
    "same _ linear elliptic equation of the form @xmath45 . for",
    "the case of sufficiently smooth @xmath46 see @xcite .",
    "when @xmath46 is allowed to be discontinuous , weak forms of lewy s theorem have been obtained in @xcite and @xcite . a version for @xmath14-laplacian type equations can be found in @xcite .    in the next theorem",
    ", we show , by means of examples , that theorem [ lewy.th ] can not be extended to an arbitrary elliptic system with constant coefficients , unless , again , the systems has the special form .",
    "[ no-hl.th ] let the ellipticity condition ( [ ell-1 ] ) be satisfied .",
    "the following alternative holds .",
    "either    \\i ) the system ( [ gen.syst ] ) is equivalent to the system    or    \\ii ) there exists a polynomial solution to @xmath47 which is a homeomorphism of a closed disk @xmath11 onto @xmath48 and such that in the center of the disk , denoted by @xmath49 , we have @xmath50    it may be evident that the rad  kneser ",
    "choquet and the h. lewy theorems continue to hold for any system of the form ( [ diag ] ) , since it can be elementarily reduced to a laplacian diagonal system via a linear change of the independent coordinates .",
    "it is although rather remarkable that theorems [ generale.th ] , [ no-hl.th ] show that the rad ",
    "choquet and the h. lewy theorems do not extend to very slight perturbations of the laplacian diagonal system such as , for instance , the following one @xmath51 where @xmath52 is any positive number .",
    "in what follows , when no ambiguity occurs , we shall identify points @xmath53 with column vectors @xmath54 . also , for @xmath55 , we shall denote @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "for the proofs of theorems [ generale.th ] and [ no-hl.th ] we shall make use of the following two propositions , which we will prove at the end of this section .",
    "[ a.prop ] let the ellipticity condition ( [ ell-1 ] ) be satisfied . if the system ( [ gen.syst ] ) is _ not _ equivalent to ( [ diag ] ) , then there exists @xmath58 $ ] and a quadratic polynomial @xmath59 such that @xmath60 is a solution to ( [ gen.syst ] ) .",
    "[ b.prop ] let the ellipticity condition ( [ ell-1 ] ) be satisfied . if the system ( [ gen.syst ] ) is _ not _ equivalent to ( [ diag ] ) , then there exists @xmath58 $ ] and a cubic polynomial @xmath61 such that @xmath62 is a solution to ( [ gen.syst ] ) .",
    "we assume that ( [ gen.syst ] ) is _ not _ equivalent to ( [ diag ] ) .",
    "we choose @xmath63 according to proposition [ a.prop ] and we write @xmath64 being linear mappings solutions to ( [ gen.syst ] ) , we have that also the following is solution to ( [ gen.syst ] ) @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant to be determined later on .",
    "we choose @xmath67 .",
    "we have @xmath68 we now select @xmath69 .",
    "we set @xmath70 a straightforward calculation shows that when @xmath71 @xmath72 is a homeomorphism of @xmath4 onto a closed convex curve @xmath73 .",
    "consequently @xmath69 is also a homeomorphism of @xmath4 onto the closed convex curve @xmath74 .",
    "[ more ] note that we can compute the the jacobian determinant of @xmath10 in terms of the coefficients of @xmath14 and obtain @xmath79 .",
    "hence the jacobian determinant vanishes at @xmath80 and , in fact , it changes sign across its _ nodal line _",
    "@xmath81 which is always an hyperbola ( unless @xmath82 when it degenerates in a straight line ) .",
    "note that @xmath83 is positive in @xmath84 zero in @xmath80 and negative in @xmath85 because of ( [ k ] ) .",
    "see figures @xmath86 and @xmath87 where the behaviour of @xmath10 and its jacobian determinant are depicted in the specific case of the lam system .",
    "we assume again that ( [ gen.syst ] ) is _ not _ equivalent to ( [ diag ] ) .",
    "we choose @xmath63 and @xmath88 according to proposition [ b.prop ] . being linear mappings solutions to ( [ gen.syst ] ) , we have that also the following is solution to ( [ gen.syst ] ) @xmath89 it is now easy to check that , once we have chosen the polynomial @xmath88 according to proposition [ b.prop ] , the following two properties hold .",
    "first there exists a positive radius @xmath90 such that one has @xmath91 if @xmath92 , where we have set @xmath93 , and second @xmath94 .",
    "choose @xmath95 , and denote by @xmath96 a very simple calculation shows that @xmath69 maps @xmath4 in a one to one way onto a closed curve @xmath5 provided one has @xmath97 let @xmath8 be the bounded domain such that @xmath9 .",
    "we can now apply a topological result of meisters and olech @xcite .",
    "indeed we have a smooth mapping @xmath10 defined on a closed disk @xmath11 and which is a local homeomorphism at each point of @xmath11 , with the possible exception of the point @xmath49 only .",
    "moreover , the restriction of @xmath10 to @xmath4 is a homeomorphism .",
    "therefore the hypotheses of theorem 1 in @xcite ( see also corollary 2 ) are satisfied and we can conclude that @xmath10 is a homeomorphism of @xmath98 onto @xmath12 .",
    "it suffices to verify that the lam system is not equivalent to any elliptic system of the form ( [ diag ] ) .",
    "in fact it can be rewritten in the form ( [ gen.syst ] ) with the following choices @xmath99 now @xmath100 and @xmath8 can be scalar multiples of @xmath101 only if @xmath102 , which contradicts the assumption @xmath18 .      in the following picture",
    "we illustrate our results for the case of the lam system .",
    "we choose @xmath104 . with this choice",
    ", condition takes the form @xmath105 and , for the picture we have chosen the limiting value @xmath106 .",
    "note that , in order to facilitate visibility , the coordinates in the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 directions are scaled differently .",
    "since the hessian matrices of @xmath111 are constant , the system ( [ gen.syst ] ) is equivalent to the following two equations @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 is a vector of known data , possibly depending on @xmath63 .",
    "given @xmath63 , the above system has at least one solution if the rank of @xmath115 is two and consequently we find a solution of the form to .",
    "if this were not the case , then for every @xmath63 there exists @xmath116 such that @xmath117 choosing @xmath118 yields that @xmath2 and @xmath8 are linearly dependent .",
    "similarly , by choosing @xmath119 , we get that @xmath101 and @xmath120 are linearly dependent . recalling that ,",
    "by ellipticity , @xmath101 and @xmath8 are positive definite , and hence nontrivial , we obtain that @xmath121 and @xmath122 for suitable constants @xmath123 . plugging these linear dependencies into and using once more ellipticity",
    ", we obtain that also @xmath8 is a scalar multiple of @xmath101 . in conclusion @xmath100 and @xmath8 are scalar multiples of @xmath101 .",
    "we look for @xmath58 $ ] and a cubic polynomial @xmath124 such that @xmath62 is a solution to ( [ gen.syst ] ) . this time the hessian matrices of @xmath111 are of the form @xmath125 for suitable constant matrices @xmath126 and @xmath127 and thus ( [ gen.syst ] ) imposes the following four conditions .",
    "@xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 is a data vector .",
    "we make use of the following linear algebra fact . given any two @xmath29 symmetric matrices",
    "@xmath131 if we have @xmath132 and either @xmath35 or @xmath133 is positive definite , then @xmath35 and @xmath133 are linearly dependent",
    ". this fact may be verified in many ways , for instance with the aid of gaussian elimination .",
    "assume that @xmath134 is singular for every @xmath63 , then we must have that the matrix @xmath135 is a scalar multiple of @xmath136 at least for all those @xmath63 for which @xmath137 is positive definite .",
    "equivalently , switching the roles of @xmath138 and @xmath139 , if @xmath135 is positive definite , then @xmath136 is a scalar multiple of @xmath135 . recalling that the matrices @xmath140 are positive definite by ellipticity , and choosing @xmath141",
    ", we deduce @xmath121 and @xmath122 for suitable constants @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , it is evident that there exists an open interval @xmath25 containing @xmath142 for which @xmath143 remains positive definite as long as @xmath144 .",
    "thus , for all @xmath145 , there exists @xmath116 such that holds true , and from now we can argue similarly as in the proof of proposition [ a.prop ] ."
