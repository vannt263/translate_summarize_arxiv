    "in the past decade , a series of experiments , in particular the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , have measured the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation with extraordinary precision .",
    "the data from these experiments have helped to usher in the era of precision cosmology .",
    "most of the cosmological results that have been obtained from these experiments have been derived from the microwave anisotropy at relatively large angular scales .",
    "the remarkable agreement between the angular power spectrum of these data and the predictions of the adiabatic inflationary scenario have established the empirical success of inflationary cosmology .",
    "cosmic strings , though ruled out as the origin of cosmological structure , have recently enjoyed a renaissance .",
    "this renewed popularity has been brought about by the recognition that a variety of string theory - motivated and hybrid models for inflation generically predict the formation of cosmic string networks @xcite .",
    "strings are limited to producing less than about 10% of the primordial cmb anisotropy @xcite , though it was shown in @xcite that cmb data can actually favor a contribution from strings if the inflationary spectrum is exactly harrison - zeldovich ( @xmath3 ) ; this corresponds to a string tension ( @xmath4 ) between @xmath5 and @xmath6 for a standard set of string network parameters .",
    "the b ( i.e. , curl ) mode polarization in the cmb caused by the active perturbations of a cosmic string network has a spectrum distinct from those expected either from inflationary gravity waves or the lensing of e ( i.e. , gradient ) mode polarization into b mode by large scale structure . when the above bound is marginally saturated , this b mode polarization should be measurable @xcite , providing a powerful test of the presence of cosmic strings .",
    "another consequence is the power spectrum of perturbations that strings source at large @xmath7 ( small angular size ) .",
    "cosmic string networks continually generate cmb anisotropies , both primordially through active density perturbations and subsequent to recombination through the lensing of the primary cmb light  the kaiser - stebbins effect ( ks ) @xcite .",
    "the cmb anisotropy due to the ks effect alone at large @xmath7 is expected to decrease only as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this rate of decrease is much slower than that expected for inflationary perturbations ( which fall off exponentially as a function of @xmath7 due to silk damping , which is due to radiative diffusion ) .",
    "if @xmath9 is not too small , this large @xmath7 power spectrum may be measurable .",
    "it should appear as an excess above the prediction from inflationary perturbations .",
    "in particular , for @xmath10 , the power created on small angular scales , @xmath2 , by cosmic strings will actually dominate over that created by the primary inflationary perturbations .",
    "this range of angular scales in the cmb is presently being measured by a number of experiments , so that this prediction of cosmic string networks will be tested soon . in this note , we present the large @xmath7 power spectrum due to cosmic strings .",
    "we use cmbact @xcite , a modified version of cmbfast @xcite , to produce the string sourced anisotropy spectra .",
    "the model , described in refs .",
    "@xcite , is based on representing the cosmic string network as a collection of moving straight string segments . in brief , there are two important length scales in this model : @xmath11 , the length of a string segment , which represents the typical length of roughly straight segments in a full network ; and @xmath12 , the typical length between two string segments , which sets the number density of strings in a given volume ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we use the velocity - dependent one - scale model ( vos ) @xcite to evolve the network length - scales and density . in the simplest and most relevant cases , @xmath14 . with these parameters",
    "set , we average over a set of randomized realizations of the network approximated as a set of straight string segments . this model was introduced in @xcite , based on the approach suggested in @xcite , and was developed into its present form in @xcite .",
    "the overall normalization of the spectrum has a simple dependence on the string tension and number density : c_^strings n_s ( g)^2 ( ) ^2 .",
    "lower reconnection probability @xcite for cosmic strings will rescale the amplitude of this spectrum , but will not change its shape . although this model assumes a single tension cosmic string network , the results described here should generally apply for more complex multi - tension string network models of the sort that may be produced in the aftermath of brane inflation @xcite .",
    "[ f1 ] shows our result . the dominance of vector modes ( the blue dashed line in the left panel ) for @xmath15 is an effect that is a distinctive signature of cosmic strings .",
    "as we show with the magenta , dash - dotted line , the string spectrum at @xmath16  where vector - sourced perturbations start to dominate  is well approximated by a @xmath17 fall off .",
    "this can be captured by a simple fitting formula : ( ( + 1)/ 2 ) c_^tt[strings ] 500 ( ) ^1.5 ( ) ^2 for 1000 .",
    "we find that towards the very high @xmath7 end of the considered range , i.e. at @xmath18 , the fall off is better described by @xmath19 , in agreement with the pure ks contribution analytically predicted in @xcite . at smaller @xmath7 ,",
    "the residual fluctuations from the last - scattering surface are non - negligible leading to a @xmath20 fall off in the @xmath21 range .    the right panel in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the high-@xmath7 power sourced by strings relative to the inflationary contribution .",
    "the string spectrum s amplitude is set by saturating the observational bound : it accounts for @xmath22% of power for @xmath0 .    ; average coherence length @xmath23 ( measured in units of the horizon size ) ; rms velocity near @xmath24 ; and average wiggliness parameter @xmath25 .",

    "it corresponds to particular values of string model parameters , such as wiggliness , coherence length , and rms velocity .",
    "it also relies on the  moving segments \" approximation used in cmbact .",
    "this model is designed to describe statistical properties of scaling string networks .",
    "for instance , it can be used to calculate cmb power spectra , but can not make a sky map of string network effects .",
    "real string simulations that capture more of the physics of networks such as their curvature and loops  are too computationally costly to be used over many expansion times . the segments model has been shown to match cmb spectra from full simulations reasonably well over the scales where they can be compared ( for a fuller discussion , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    while varying the string tension , @xmath4 , simply renormalizes the spectrum , changing the other parameters can re - distribute the power between the large and small scales .",
    "generally , smaller velocities and smaller coherence lengths enhance the power in vector modes at high @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "more wiggliness tends to make strings move more slowly .",
    "this suppresses all contributions to the anisotropic stress , including the vector modes @xcite . for this plot",
    ", we used a model with @xmath28 with an average string coherence length of @xmath29 of the horizon size , . ] a rms velocity of @xmath30 , and an average wiggliness parameter @xmath31 of @xmath32 .",
    "these values are fairly close to those seen in numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) , but are slightly different from those used in the default version of cmbact ; the values chosen here are those which slightly enhance the string - sourced power at high @xmath7 .",
    "fractionally greater ( or attenuated ) power at small angular scales can be achieved with different model parameters , but the overall behavior at high @xmath7 is a generic feature of string networks .",
    "all cosmological parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath33 , @xmath34 , etc , are those of the latest wmap best fit @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings produce power on small angular scales because they are _ active _ sources that continue contributing to the anisotropy after the last scattering . for that reason they evade silk damping , _",
    "i.e. _ the erasure of anisotropies on small scales due to the finite thickness of the last scattering surface . a network of cosmic strings with a tension near the present observational bound of @xmath35 can dominate the power spectrum of cmb fluctuations in the strongly silk - damped regime ( @xmath36 ) of the microwave background anisotropy , creating an apparent excess of power over what is expected from an inflationary adiabatic perturbation spectrum .",
    "this high @xmath7 regime is accessible to existing fine scale resolution experiments like the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) @xcite and the arcminute cosmology bolometer array receiver ( acbar ) @xcite now , and will soon be measured very accurately by experiments like the south pole telescope @xcite and the atacama cosmology telescope @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that these experiments published data already show some hints of excess power in the high - multipole range ; see fig .",
    "[ withacbar ] for a rough comparison with the data from acbar .",
    "cmb anisotropy in the acbar range , plotted against the latest data from the acbar experiment .",
    "the dotted blue line is the inflationary prediction alone ( including lensing , from the software package camb @xcite ) ; the dashed black line includes the contribution from a cosmic string network .",
    "the amplitude fitting has been done roughly , by eye , to match the two theoretical curves with the second acbar data point ; the cosmological parameters are all those of the wmap best fit . ,",
    "width=288 ]    although we have not done a statistical analysis , the preliminary results presented here suggest that cosmic strings with @xmath37 could contribute enough power to account for the excess over inflation suggested by the acbar data at @xmath38 without exceeding observational bounds on string contributions at @xmath39 .",
    "excess power in the high-@xmath7 cmb can also be generated by other physical phenomena , including the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite and tangled primordial magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "using the sz effect to account for any substantial excess measurable by today s experiments is problematic , however , because the amount of small - scale gravitational clustering ( measured by the parameter @xmath40 ) required to generate a large excess over the inflationary prediction via the sz effect is in some conflict with values determined by other experiments .",
    "tangled magnetic fields , on the other hand , are not meaningfully constrained by competing experiments , but their existence at the necessary epoch is by no means accounted for .",
    "discovery of significant high @xmath7 excess power in cmb that can not be explained by more conventional means could be taken as evidence for existence of cosmic strings with tensions near the observational bound .",
    "on the other hand , if no excess is seen at large @xmath7 , non - observation of this effect will provide a useful bound on the properties of any cosmic string network .",
    "strings with tensions in this range can be searched for by some other means , such as gravitational lensing and microlensing @xcite , gravitational radiation bursts @xcite , pulsar timing or non - gaussian step - like fluctuations in cmb temperature @xcite .",
    "an especially promising signature of such strings would be a substantial b mode polarization @xcite ; for @xmath4 around @xmath41 , the b mode polarization fluctuations from strings could exceed expected power from e to b conversion by gravitational lensing by factors of a few .",
