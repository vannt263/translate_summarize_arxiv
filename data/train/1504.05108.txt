    "stabilizing single - crystalline euo tunnel barriers on silicon is complicated by the formation of amorphous silicon oxides ( sio@xmath3)@xcite or metallic silicides ( eusi@xmath4),@xcite which readily form during reactive oxide synthesis at elevated substrate temperatures.[see the supplemental information ] both contaminants counteract mo / si heteroepitaxy and may reduce or even completely suppress the spin filter tunnel functionality.[see the supplemental information ]    in order to overcome these challenges , previous studies used an additional metallic@xcite or oxidic buffer layer between silicon and euo as a chemical diffusion barrier , such as sro , bao or mgo , which allow for a successive heteroepitaxial growth of euo.@xcite these additional layers are several nanometers thick and have to be synthesized in a separate process step on top of the silicon substrate . in spin - dependent transport , however , they act as additional tunnel barriers and have the drawback of significantly reducing the electron transfer ratio and spin filter effect .",

    "a clear dependence is observable : both an increase of the substrate temperature @xmath21 as well as applying the h - passivation of si ( 001 ) reduces the silicide fraction at the euo / si interface .",

    "structure only if euo is directly deposited on si ( 001 ) ( inset in fig.[fig : silicides - fits]a ) .",
    "this low crystallinity is explained by the presence of excess eu and silicides from an incomplete eu distillation condition ( fig.[fig : silicides - fits]a , c ) . at elevayed substrate temperature ( @xmath27 ) , in contrast , single - crystalline euo with sharp - defined reciprocal rods in the rheed pattern are observed . in this synthesis regime , the application of a h - passivation to the si surface facilitates an highly ordered euo growth , but , at the same time , introduces a certain roughness in growth direction as reflected by the distinct vertical maxima in the rheed pattern in fig.[fig : silicides - fits]d , which we attribute to different h - si surface reconstructions.@xcite thus , the result is twofold : we find the smoother euo film at high synthesis temperature ( @xmath27 ) which confirms heteroepitaxy of euo directly on flashed si ( 001 ) .",

    "nm euo / h - si synthesized at lower temperature , @xmath30 is dramatically reduced to @xmath31 ( fig.[fig : silicides - magnetic]a ) and the field dependence shows mainly paramagnetic behavior ( fig.[fig : silicides - magnetic]c ) .",
    "consistent with the haxpes analysis , a coverage of paramagnetic europium silicides at the euo / si interface results in this magnetic response .",
    "in contrast , the curie temperature of the high-@xmath18 euo spin contact is bulk - near @xmath32 , which agrees well with results obtained for the reference sample .",
    "hence , the reduction of the curie temperature is explained by a reduced nearest neighbor ( nn ) interaction in laterally expanded ultrathin euo films@xcite rather than to formation of silicides at the interface .",
    "also , the field dependence of the high-@xmath18 euo spin contact ( fig.[fig : silicides - magnetic]b ) agrees well with a successful diminishment of the paramagnetic silicides , with an emergent ferromagnetic switching behavior and a bulk - near specific magnetic moment ( @xmath33 ; @xmath34 ) .      in a last step ,",
    "we ultimately combine the benefits of the two complementary euo / si interface passivations : ( _ i _ ) the hydrogen - passivated si ( 001 ) surface and ( _ ii _ ) the eu monolayer - passivated si interface . by integrating these two _ in situ _ passivation techniques we simultaneously minimize eu silicides as well as sio@xmath3 at the euo / si ( 001 ) interface  but the challenge remains to find the optimal thermodynamic conditions .    as a starting point",
    ", we use the optimum set of passivation parameters of the previous sections for the silicide as well as the silicon oxide minimization : the euo / si ( 001 ) heterointerface is now passivated with two monolayers of eu in addition to a complete _ in situ _ h passivation of the si ( 100 ) wafer .",

    "consistent with the previous optimizations , we quantify the chemical state of the euo / si heterointerface with combined h - si and eu monolayer passivation by interface - sensitive haxpes analyses of the si @xmath5 spectra ( fig.[fig : combined ] ) . as a first result we note that varying @xmath21 for euo synthesis does not show a significant effect on the formation of eu silicides : the eusi@xmath11 interfacial thickness is about @xmath36 for all three samples , in good agreement with the optimum value of the silicide optimization study ( sec._euo / si with hydrogen interface passivation _ ) .",
    "the euo / si interface oxidation , however , exhibits a clear minimum value of @xmath36 for the sample synthesized at @xmath27 , while a maximum oxidation of the si interface is observed for the euo / si interface which was exposed to the highest euo synthesis temperature , @xmath37 .",
    "we attribute the enhanced si oxidation to an increased si mobility and reevaporation of the eu interface passivation at the highest @xmath18 .",

    "all three euo samples in this combind si oxide + eu silicde optimization study confirm a clear cubic heteroepitaxy on passivated si ( 001 ) without signs of strain relaxation .",
    "the ferromagnetism of these optimal euo spin contacts was confirmed up to by squid magnetometry and all resemble the same @xmath39 vs @xmath40 behavior as shown in fig.[fig : silicides - magnetic]a , which agrees well with the silicide diminishment to the same minimum .",

    "we performed a systematic study on the beneficial impact of each passivation step and finally combined the results to gain the optimum set of synthesis conditions for euo / si ( 001 ) spin contacts .",
