    "whispering - gallery mode ( wgm ) microcavities represent one of the most promising candidates for a wide range of fundamental studies and applications , including cavity quantum electrodynamics , cavity optomechanics , microlasers , filters and biological sensors ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to the rotational symmetry , they suffer from inefficient coupling with the outside modes , which limits their applications , especially in microlasers @xcite .",
    "one of the solutions is the tapered fiber coupling method @xcite , which possesses nearly unity efficiency",
    ". nevertheless , convenient free - space coupling without near - field couplers is eagerly required because of the experimental limitations @xcite .",
    "for example , the external couplers are not convenient at low temperature chambers ; for a higher - index - material resonator @xcite , its coupling with the tapered fiber is inefficient due to the phase mismatch . alternatively ,",
    "deformed cavities ( also named as asymmetric resonant cavity , arc ) are proposed @xcite , because they allow high - efficiency free - space excitation and directional emission .",
    "latest developments in arc studies include limacon - shaped cavity @xcite and circular disk cavity with a linear @xcite or point defect in it @xcite , but the emission divergence angles are still too broad .",
    "very recently , highly directional outputs are obtained in an elliptical microdisk with a notch at the boundary @xcite , and by placing a nanoparticle into the evanescent wave region of microcavities @xcite .",
    "these investigations focused on two - dimensional ( 2d ) microcavity systems by resorting to numerical simulations .",
    "however , 2d microcavities exhibit relatively low quality ( @xmath2 ) factors in experiment and there are significant energy losses in the perpendicular dimension .",
    "thus , there is an interest to employ 3d microcavities , whereas it is difficult to perform numerical simulations .",
    "here we present a cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) treatment of 3d microsphere - scatterer coupling system , and derive analytical expression of the free - space excitation and the emission directionality .",
    "our results explicitly reveal the underlying physics and is also suitable for 2d case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we briefly describe the microsphere - scatterer coupling system . in sec .",

    "the quantum treatment of rayleigh scattering is widely used and well demonstrated @xcite .",
    "this quantum treatment is necessary because in such a scatterer - microsphere coupling system there exists a phenomenon similar with the purcell effect , since the high state density of wgms causes the enhanced scattering between the wgms and the free - space reservoir modes @xcite . in the following",
    "we adopt this quantum approach to analyze the free - space excitation of wgms and the free - space collection of scattered lasing modes , respectively .",
    "in this section , we develop the theoretical model to describe the scattering - induced coupling among the surrounding optical modes . by writing down the total hamiltonian , we derive the equations of motion ( quantum langevin equations ) for the free - space excitation process .",
    "then we find analytical expressions for the coupling coefficients and the excitation efficiency .",
