    "given a bounded , polyhedral domain @xmath0 , we consider the convection - diffusion equations    [ cd_eqs ] @xmath1    the data and the right - hand sides in ( [ cd_eqs ] ) satisfy the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "3 .   @xmath7 .",
    "4 .   there is a function @xmath8 and a positive constant @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "assumption ( a1 ) includes the case of the convection - dominated regime .",
    "according to @xcite , assumption ( a4 ) is satisfied if @xmath11 has no closed curves and @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that solutions of ( [ cd_eqs ] ) may develop layers ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the solutions may have singular interior layer of width @xmath13 or outflow layer of width @xmath14 .",
    "standard numerical methods , e.g. , standard finite element method or central finite difference method , are not robust when the quantity @xmath15 is small compared to the mesh size . in order to stabilize the numerical method ,",
    "several remedies are proposed for addressing the issue , for instance , streamline diffusion method @xcite , residual free bubble methods @xcite , local projection schemes @xcite , subgrid scale method @xcite , continuous interior penalty ( cip ) methods @xcite , discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite , and recently discontinuous petrov - galerkin ( dpg ) methods @xcite , hdg method @xcite and the first order least squares method @xcite .",
    "one can refer to @xcite for more other stabilization techniques .",
    "but in order to capture the potential interior or outflow layer of the solutions to the problem ( [ cd_eqs ] ) , the local pclet number @xmath16 near the layers should be small enough , where @xmath17 is the mesh size",
    ". hence it would be quite expensive for the stabilized numerical methods used on the quasi - uniform mesh to capture the layers when @xmath18 is small .",
    "if the mesh in the vicinity of the layers can be locally refined , the cost of numerical computations could be reduced .",
    "therefore the adaptive finite element method is a natural choice for the efficient solution of convection - diffusion equations with dominant convection .",
    "the adaptive finite element method based on a posteriori error estimates have been well established for second - order elliptic problems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in recent years",
    "the a posteriori error estimates are also extended to convection - diffusion equation .",
    "an early attempt was proposed by eriksson and johnson in @xcite , using regularization and duality techniques .",
    "verfrth @xcite proposed semi - robust estimators in the energy norm for the standard galerkin approximation and the streamline upwind petrov - galerkin ( supg ) discretization . in @xcite verfrth improved his results by giving the estimates which are robust with dominant convection in a norm incorporating the standard energy norm and a dual norm of the convective derivative .",
    "very recently , tobiska and verfrth @xcite derived the same robust a posteriori error estimators for a wide range of stabilized finite element methods such as streamline diffusion methods , local projection schemes , subgrid scale technique and cip method .",
    "however , the energy norm of error used in verfrth s estimates is defined through a dual norm which is not easy to compute .",
    "sangalli @xcite proposed different norms for the a posteriori error estimates that allow for robust estimators , but the analysis is only valid in the one dimensional case .",
    "as to other approaches for the robust error estimations , one can refer to @xcite for mixed finite element methods , @xcite for cell - centered finite volume scheme , @xcite for nonconforming finite element method , @xcite for interior penalty discontinuous galerkin method .",
    "discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods have several attractive features compared with conforming finite element methods .",
    "for example , dg methods have elementwise conservation of mass , and they work well on arbitrary meshes .",
    "however , the dimension of the approximation dg space is much larger than the dimension of the corresponding conforming space .",
    "the hdg method @xcite was recently introduced to address this issue .",
    "hdg methods retain the advantages of standard dg methods and result in significant reduced degrees of freedom .",
    "new variables on all interfaces of mesh are introduced such that the numerical solution inside each element can be computed in terms of them , and the resulting algebraic system is only due to the unknowns on the skeleton of the mesh . in @xcite ,",
    "the hdg method was proposed and analyzed for the problem ( [ cd_eqs ] ) on shape - regular mesh .",
    "the stabilization parameter of the hdg method in @xcite can be determined clearly , meanwhile the penalty parameters of the dg schemes @xcite need to be chosen empirically . moreover , the condition number of stiffness matrix of a new way of implementing hdg method in @xcite was proven to be bounded by @xmath19 and independent of the diffusion coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "these properties are important for the efficient solution of the problem ( [ cd_eqs ] ) and encourage us to consider the corresponding hdg method on adaptive meshes .",
    "the a posteriori error analysis for the hdg method for second order elliptic problems has been presented in @xcite , where the error incorporates only the flux and a postprocessed solution used in the estimators . to our best knowledge ,",
    "no a posteriori error estimates for the hdg discretizations of convection - diffusion problems have been studied in the literature so far . in this work ,",
    "our objective is to show that the hdg scheme proposed in @xcite gives rise to robust a posteriori error estimates for the problem ( [ cd_eqs ] ) . in comparison with the postprocessing technique utilized in @xcite",
    ", we establish the estimators without any postprocessed solution since the solution of ( [ cd_eqs ] ) is always not smooth and there is no superconvergence result for the hdg method when @xmath20 .",
    "we notice that the a posteriori error estimators for nonconforming finite element method @xcite and interior penalty dg method @xcite are only semi - robust in the sense that they yield lower and upper bounds of the error which differ by a factor equal at most to @xmath21 . in @xcite ,",
    "the a posteriori error estimator is robust in the sense that the ratio of the constants in the upper and lower bounds of error is independent of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "however , the energy norm of error in @xcite contains the jump term @xmath22 on each interior interface of meshes .",
    "in contrast , the a posteriori error estimator in this paper is robust based on the energy norm in ( [ energy - error ] ) , which contains a jump term @xmath23 instead .",
    "one can refer to ( [ a_gamma ] ) for the definition of paparemeter @xmath24 .",
    "so , our a posteriori error estimator will not enlarge the error estimate too much as the error estimator in @xcite , when the mesh size is not small compared with the diffusion coefficient .    to derive the reliability and efficiency of the estimators for the error measured in an energy norm which incorporates a scaling flux and the scalar solution of the hdg discretization ,",
    "two techniques are utilized .",
    "the first one is to use the oswald interpolation operator to approximate a discontinuous polynomial by a continuous and piecewise polynomial function and to control the approximation by the jumps ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for most of a posteriori error estimates mentioned above ( e.g. @xcite ) , the analysis only gives the estimates for the energy error without @xmath25-error of the scalar solution when @xmath26 .",
    "the second one is to address this issue and to employ a weighted function to derive the estimates for the error which contains @xmath25-error of the scalar solution .",
    "this idea goes back to nvert s work @xcite for convection - diffusion problems and was used to obtain the @xmath25-stability of the original dg method for pure hyperbolic equation @xcite and extended to convection - diffusion equations using the ip - dg method @xcite , the hdg method @xcite and the first order least squares method @xcite .    in the numerical experiments ,",
    "the convection - diffusion problems with interior or outflow layers are tested based on the proposed a posteriori error estimator .",
    "the robustness of the a posteriori error estimator based on the hdg method is observed for the problems with different diffusion coefficient .",
    "we also find that the convergence of the adaptive hdg method is almost optimal , i.e. , the convergence rate is almost @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of elements , @xmath29 depends on the polynomial order @xmath30 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we introduce some notations , the hdg method , a posteriori error estimator and main results in the next section . in section 3 ,",
    "we collect some auxiliary results for analysis .",
    "section 4 and section 5 are devoted to the proofs of reliability and efficiency , respectively . in the final section ,",
    "we give some numerical results to confirm our theoretical analysis .",
    "in this section , we begin with some basic notation and hypotheses of meshes .",
    "secondly , we introduce the hdg method for ( [ cd_eqs ] ) in @xcite .",
