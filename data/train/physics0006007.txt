    "in contrast to polarized high energy electron beams which can become polarized by the emission of spin flip synchrotron radiation , proton beams do not become polarized after acceleration .",
    "high energy polarized protons can only be produced by accelerating a beam from a polarized ion source .",
    "the highest energy reached so far was 25gev in the ags and a lot of care had to be taken during acceleration to preserve this injected polarization @xcite .",
    "to explain depolarization in circular accelerators , some concepts from spin dynamics have to be introduced .",
    "when a particle with charge @xmath0 moves through a magnetic field , the motion of the classical spin vector in the instantaneous rest frame is described by the lorentz force equation and the thomas - bmt equation @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath2 are the magnetic field components perpendicular and parallel to the particle s momentum @xmath3 . at high energy where @xmath4 , the spin motion is independent of energy and a fixed field integral of @xmath5tm leads to a spin rotation of @xmath6 , in contrast to the orbit deflection which varies with @xmath7 . for fixed orbit deflections and thus fixed ratio of @xmath8 , the spin precession rate increases with energy as we now describe .    in purely transverse magnetic fields , the thomas - bmt equation has the same structure as the lorentz force equation up to a factor @xmath9 .",
    "the spin therefore rotates like the momentum but with a magnified rate . at the hera energy of 920gev ,",
    "the magnification factor is @xmath10 so that the spin is rotated by @xmath11 when a proton s direction is altered by 1mrad in a transverse magnetic field and the spin rotates 1756 times around the vertical while a particle makes one turn on the design orbit of a flat circular accelerator , where the fields are vertical .",
    "the number of spin rotations which a particle performs while it travels along the closed orbit once is called the spin tune @xmath12 .",
    "when the spin tune is integer , the spin comes back to a field imperfection with the same direction after one turn and the effect of the field error can add up coherently from turn to turn .",
    "this resonant depolarization at integer spin tunes @xmath13 is called an _ imperfection resonance _ @xcite .    when viewed at a fixed azimuth @xmath14 of the accelerator",
    ", the particles appear to perform harmonic oscillations around the closed orbit with the frequencies @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for horizontal , vertical , and longitudinal motion .",
    "these are called the orbital tunes .",
    "some of the fields through which a particle propagates will therefore oscillate with the orbital tunes .",
    "whenever the non - integer part of the spin tune is equal to plus or minus one of these frequencies , the resulting coherent perturbation can lead to depolarization .",
    "the coherent depolarization at the first order resonance condition @xmath18 is called an _ intrinsic resonance _ @xcite . here",
    "the notation @xmath19=@xmath15 , @xmath20=-@xmath15 , @xmath21=@xmath16 , @xmath22=-@xmath16 , @xmath23=@xmath17 , @xmath24=-@xmath17 is used . since the spin tune changes with energy ( in a flat ring @xmath25 )",
    "resonances will have to be crossed at some energies during acceleration .",
    "after one turn around the accelerator , all spins of particles on the closed orbit have been rotated by @xmath26 around a unit rotation vector @xmath27 .",
    "this vector is determined by the accelerator s main guide fields and small field imperfections only perturb @xmath28 weakly except at energies where the guide fields would produce an integer spin tune . then , when viewed from a fixed azimuth , spins would come back after one turn apparently without a rotation .",
    "close to imperfection resonances the remaining rotation and therefore the direction of @xmath29 will be dominated by the influence of field errors . while the energy changes during acceleration , @xmath29 changes its direction strongly at these resonances . whenever this change is sufficiently slow , spins which are initially parallel to @xmath29",
    "will follow the change of @xmath29 adiabatically .",
    "imperfection resonances can therefore be crossed either by making the field imperfections small enough or by making them so strong that @xmath29 already starts to get influenced by the field errors sufficiently long before the resonance and then changes slowly enough to let all spins follow adiabatically while the resonance is crossed .",
    "special magnets for enhancing this effect without disturbing the orbit are referred to as partial snakes .",
    "so far solenoid magnets have been used @xcite but for the ags a helical dipole partial snake is under construction @xcite .",
    "the motion of spins along phase space trajectories is dominated by the main guide fields on the closed orbit except close to an intrinsic resonance , where the coherent perturbations described above can dominate over the main guide fields .",
    "when the emittance of the beam and therefore the amplitude of the perturbations is sufficiently small , intrinsic resonances can be crossed without loss of polarization .",
    "polarization in the core of the beam will therefore be only weakly influenced when crossing intrinsic resonances . if a strong coherent perturbation is slowly switched on and off , an effect similar to adiabatically following @xmath29 occurs and polarization is conserved .",
    "therefore , while an intrinsic resonance is crossed , perturbations influencing particles in the tails of a beam will slowly increase already before the resonance and this adiabatic conservation of polarization can occur . in intermediate parts of the beam , however , the polarization is lost .",
    "this type of depolarization can be overcome by slowly exciting the whole beam coherently at a frequency close to the orbital tune which causes the perturbation .",
    "all spins then follow the adiabatic change of the polarization direction and the resonance can be crossed with little loss of polarization .",
    "the excitation amplitude is then reduced slowly so that the beam emittance does not change noticeably during the whole process .",
    "this mechanism has recently been tested successfully at the ags @xcite .",
    "an older technique of avoiding depolarization at strong intrinsic resonances utilizes pulsed quadrupoles to move the orbital tune within a few microseconds just before a resonance so that the resonance is crossed so quickly that the spin motion is hardly disturbed @xcite .",
    "so far no polarized beam has been accelerated to more than 25gev @xcite .",
    "but the possibility of polarized proton acceleration has been analyzed for rhic ( 250gev ) , for the tevatron ( 900gev ) , and for hera ( 920gev ) .",
    "when accelerating through approximately 5000 resonances in the case of hera , even very small depolarization in every resonance crossing would add up to a detrimental effect .",
    "it was mentioned below equation ( [ eq : bmt ] ) that in a fixed transverse magnetic field the deflection angle of high energy particles depends on energy , whereas the spin rotation does not depend on energy .",
    "it is therefore possible to devise a fixed field magnetic device which rotates spins by @xmath30 whenever a high energy particle travels through it at the different energies of an acceleration cycle .",
    "such field arrangements which rotate spins by @xmath30 while perturbing the orbit only moderately are called siberian snakes @xcite .",
    "the rotation axis is called the snake axis and the angle of this axis to the beam direction is referred to as the snake angle @xmath31 .",
    "let us consider a siberian snake with snake angle @xmath32 at one point in a flat ring and a second siberian snake with snake angle @xmath33 at the opposite side of the ring where the spin has rotated by @xmath34 .",
    "the spin rotation around the vertical between the siberian snakes is described with pauli matrices by the quaternion @xmath35 .",
    "the rotation by the first siberian snake is described by @xmath36\\;$ ] . the total rotation for one turn around the ring is then described by @xmath37\\cdot   [ \\cos(\\pi g\\gamma/2)+i\\sin(\\pi g\\gamma/2)\\sigma_2 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cdot\\ ; i[\\sin(\\psi_2)\\sigma_1+\\cos(\\psi_2)\\sigma_3]\\cdot   [ \\cos(\\pi g\\gamma/2)+i\\sin(\\pi g\\gamma/2)\\sigma_2 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\phantom{\\cdot}\\ ; i[\\sin(\\psi_1+\\pi g\\gamma/2)\\sigma_1+\\cos(\\psi_1+\\pi g\\gamma/2)\\sigma_3 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cdot\\ ; i[\\sin(\\psi_2+\\pi g\\gamma/2)\\sigma_1+\\cos(\\psi_2+\\pi g\\gamma/2)\\sigma_3 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\cos(\\psi_1-\\psi_2)+i\\sin(\\psi_1-\\psi_2)\\sigma_2\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath38 the spins rotate in total @xmath39 times around the vertical @xmath29 during a complete turn around the ring , giving @xmath40 .",
    "all imperfection resonances and , since the orbital tunes can not be @xmath39 , also all first order intrinsic resonances are avoided by the insertion of these two siberian snakes , and polarized beam acceleration to very high energy could become possible .",
    "siberian snakes can only be used at sufficiently high energies since their fields are not changed during acceleration of the beam and they produce orbit distortions which are too big for energies below approximately 8gev@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "for hera a polarized proton beam would be produced by a polarized h@xmath42 source . then it would be accelerated to 750kev in an rfq and then to 50mev in the linac  iii from where it would be accelerated in the synchrotron desy  iii to 7.5gev / c . in the next ring , petra , 40gev / c",
    "are reached , and hera finally accelerates to 920gev / c .",
    "the four main challenges for obtaining highly polarized beams in hera are : ( 1 ) _ production _ of a 20ma pulsed h@xmath42 beam .",
    "( 2 ) _ polarimetry _ at various stages in the acceleration chain . ( 3 ) _ acceleration _ through the complete accelerator chain with little depolarization . ( 4 ) _ storage _ of a polarized beam at the top energy over many hours with little depolarization .",
    "polarized protons are produced either by a polarized atomic beam source ( abs ) , where a pulsed beam with 87% polarization for 1ma beam current has been achieved , or by an optically pumped polarized ion source ( oppis ) , where pulsed beams with 60% for 5ma have been achieved .",
    "experts claim that 80% polarization and 20ma could be achievable with the second type of source .",
    "the current source at desy produces 60ma but the maximal current of 205ma in desy  iii can already be achieved with a 20ma source .",
    "polarimeters will have to be installed at several crucial places in the accelerator chain .",
    "the source would contain a lyman-@xmath43 polarimeter @xcite .",
    "another polarimeter could be installed after the rfq @xcite .",
    "this could not be operated continuously since it disturbs the beam .",
    "the transfer of polarized particles through the linac  iii could be optimized with a polarimeter similar to that in the ags linac ; and like the ags , desy  iii could contain an internal polarimeter @xcite .",
    "polarization at desy  iii energies has been achieved and measured at several labs already .",
    "it is different with petra and hera energies ; for these high energies there is no established polarimeter .",
    "here one has to wait and see how the novel techniques envisaged and developed for rhic will work @xcite .    since desy  iii has a super period of eight , only 4 strong intrinsic first order resonances have to be crossed .",
    "they are at values for the spin tune @xmath44 of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "depolarization can be avoided by jumping the tune with pulsed quadrupoles in a few microseconds or by excitation of a resonance with an rf dipole .",
    "a solenoid partial snake would be used to cross the one strong imperfection resonance at @xmath49 .",
    "all these methods have been tested successfully at the ags and it is likely that a highly polarized proton beam could be extracted from the desy  iii synchrotron at 7.5gev / c@xmath41 .    in petra",
    "it would be very cumbersome to cross all resonances which can be seen in figure [ fig : res ]  ( middle ) . since siberian snakes can be constructed for the injection energy of petra @xcite it will be best to avoid all first order resonances with two such devices .",
    "there is space for siberian snakes in the east and the west section of petra .",
    "hera is a very complex accelerator and a brief look already indicates four reasons why producing a polarized beam in hera is more difficult than in an ideal ring .",
    "( 1 ) hera has a super periodicity of one and only an approximate mirror symmetry between the north and south halves of the ring .",
    "therefore more resonances appear than in a ring with some higher super periodicity and special schemes for canceling resonances in symmetric lattices @xcite can not be used in such a ring .",
    "( 2 ) the proton ring of hera is on top of the electron ring in the arcs , and the proton beam is bent down to the level of the electron ring on both sides of the three experiments h1 , hermes , and zeus in the north , east , and south straight sections .",
    "the hera proton accelerator is therefore not a flat ring .",
    "the destructive effect of the vertical bends can , however , be eliminated by so called flattening snakes @xcite which let the spin motion in pairs of vertical bends cancel and makes @xmath29 vertical outside the non - flat sections of hera .",
    "( 3 ) there is space for spin rotators which make the polarization parallel to the beam direction inside the collider experiments while keeping it vertical in the arcs , and there is also space for four siberian snakes . but",
    "installing more than four siberian snakes would involve a lot of costly construction work .",
    "simulations have shown that 8 snakes with properly chosen snake angles would be desirable . however",
    ", if one does not choose optimal snake angles , then four - snake - schemes can be better than eight snake schemes @xcite . ( 4 ) the energy is very high and therefore the spin rotates rapidly .",
    "if hera had been designed for polarized proton acceleration , several parts of the ring would probably have been constructed differently .",
    "in the isolated resonance model , the field components which perturb the spin of a particle that oscillates around the closed orbit are fourier expanded .",
    "the perturbation of spin motion is then approximated by dropping all except one of the fourier components .",
    "when @xmath50 describes the phase space coordinates relative to the closed orbit and @xmath14 describes the accelerator s azimuth , the thomas - bmt equation ( [ eq : bmt ] ) has the form @xmath51 .",
    "the precession vector @xmath52 can be written as @xmath53 with a part on the closed orbit and a part which is linear in the phase space coordinates @xmath50 . for spins parallel to the rotation vector on the closed orbit @xmath54 only the components of @xmath55 which are perpendicular to @xmath29 perturb the polarization",
    "we now choose two mutually orthogonal unit vectors @xmath56 and @xmath57 which are perpendicular to @xmath29 and precess around @xmath58 according to the thomas - bmt equation on the closed orbit .",
    "the frequency of their rotation is given by the spin tune @xmath13 .",
    "in this model a depolarizing resonance occures when a fourier component of @xmath59 rotates with the same frequency as @xmath56 and @xmath57 so that there is a coherent perturbation of the spins away from @xmath29 .",
    "the fourier component @xmath60 for this frequency is obtained from the fourier integral along a trajectory @xmath61 , @xmath62 these resonance strengths are shown in the figure [ fig : res ]  ( top ) , ( middle ) , and ( bottom ) for the three proton synchrotrons at desy .",
    "they were all computed for an oscillation amplitude of @xmath63 corresponding to the one sigma vertical emittance of @xmath64mm@xmath41mrad .      already at extraction from petra",
    "the polarized beam would have somewhat more energy than any other polarized proton beam so far obtained and one has to ask whether the isolated resonance model successfully used so far for describing depolarization is still applicable . to understand whether the isolated resonance model describes spin motion at hera accurately , we introduce the invariant spin field of a circular accelerator .",
    "it has been mentioned that a particle on the closed orbit has to be polarized parallel to @xmath28 in order to have the same polarization after every turn .",
    "similarly , one can ask if the whole field of spin directions for particles at different phase space points can be invariant from turn to turn .",
    "each particle can have a different spin direction at its phase space point @xmath65 and each of these spins propagates with a different precession vector @xmath66 in the thomas - bmt equation .",
    "a spin field @xmath67 which is invariant after one turn around the ring is called an invariant spin field or a derbenev  kontratenko @xmath68-axis @xcite . a beam",
    "which is polarized parallel to this invariant spin field at every phase space point does not change its polarization state from turn to turn .",
    "particles change their location in phase space from some initial phase space coordinate @xmath69 in the poincar section at azimuth @xmath14 to some final coordinate after one turn @xmath70 according to the one turn map . and spins change their directions according to the one turn spin transport matrix @xmath71 , but the invariant field of spin directions @xmath72 does not change after one turn .",
    "this requirement is encompassed by the periodicity condition @xmath73 note that the polarization state of a particle beam is in general not invariant from turn to turn when all particles are initially completely polarized parallel to each other , but rather when each particle is polarized parallel to @xmath67 at its phase space point @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the polarization of a particle will be parallel to @xmath74 whenever it comes close to its initial phase space point @xmath69 during later turns around the ring , as long as @xmath67 is sufficiently continuous .",
    "when two particles travel along the same trajectory , the angle between their two spins does not change .",
    "when a particle is initially polarized with an angle @xmath75 to @xmath67 , it will therefore be rotated around @xmath67 every time it comes close to @xmath69 , but it will still have the angle @xmath75 to the invariant spin field .",
    "the time averaged polarization at @xmath69 will therefore be parallel to @xmath74 , but it can only have the magnitude 1 if the spin was initially parallel to the invariant spin field .",
    "however , even if all particles are initially polarized parallel to @xmath67 , the beam polarization is not 1 but @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes an average over the beam .",
    "the maximum average polarization that can be stored in an accelerator at a given fixed energy is therefore @xmath78 .",
    "it was first pointed out in @xcite that this maximum polarization can be small in hera .",
    "since the spin dynamics depends on energy , the invariant spin field @xmath67 will change during the acceleration process .",
    "if this change is slow enough , spins which are parallel to @xmath67 will follow adiabatically . however , if the change is too rapid , polarization will be lost .",
    "it is therefore good to have @xmath76 close to 1 not only at the collider energy but during the complete acceleration cycle .",
    "four problems occur when the different directions of @xmath67 are not close to parallel for all particles in the beam .",
    "( 1 ) sudden changes of @xmath67 reduces the polarization .",
    "( 2 ) the average polarization available to the collider experiment is reduced .",
    "( 3 ) the polarization involved in each collision process depends on the phase space position of the interacting particles .",
    "( 4 ) measuring the polarization in the tail of the beam will not give accurate information on the average polarization of the beam .      at azimuth @xmath14",
    ", a spin can be described by a usually small complex coordinate @xmath43 with @xmath79 .",
    "when the spin coordinates @xmath43 and the phase space coordinates are linearized , one approximates an initial spin by @xmath80 at azimuth @xmath81 and the final spin after one turn around the accelerator by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is determined by the @xmath84 one turn transport matrix @xmath85 , @xmath86 whereby @xmath87 is the @xmath88 dimensional one turn transport matrix for the phase space variables , the exponential describes the rotation of the spin components @xmath43 by the spin tune @xmath13 around @xmath29 , the row vector @xmath89 describes the dependence of spin motion on phase space motion to first order , and the 6 dimensional zero vector @xmath90 shows that the effect of stern gerlach forces on the orbit motion is not considered .",
    "we now write the components perpendicular to @xmath29 of the invariant spin field as a complex function @xmath91 and use a 7 dimensional vector @xmath92 to obtain the first order expansion of @xmath67 .",
    "the linearized periodicity condition for the invariant spin field is @xmath93 this equation can be solved for @xmath92 after the matrices are diagonalized .",
    "let @xmath94 be the column matrix of eigenvectors of the one turn matrix @xmath87 .",
    "the diagonalized matrix of orbit motion @xmath95 has the diagonal elements @xmath96 given by the orbital tunes @xmath97 , @xmath98 , etc .",
    "we now need the @xmath99 dimensional matrix @xmath100 which is the column matrix of the first 6 eigenvectors of @xmath85 and has the form @xmath101 where the 7th components of the eigenvectors form a vector @xmath102 .",
    "if a linear function @xmath103 of the phase space coordinates can be found , which satisfies the periodicity condition ( [ eq : period1 ] ) , then an invariant spin field has been determined .",
    "inserting the form @xmath104 into equation ( [ eq : period1 ] ) and multiplying the resulting condition @xmath105 by @xmath94 from the right leads to @xmath106 .",
    "therefore @xmath107 is the @xmath108 dimensional matrix of eigenvectors @xmath100 satisfying equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) and we conclude that there exists a unique linear invariant spin field given by @xmath109 in the linear approximation of spin motion , the invariant spin field is simply computed via the eigenvectors of the @xmath84 spin orbit transport matrix .",
    "this matrix @xmath110 can be computed in various ways , for example by multiplying the individual spin transport matrixes of all elements @xcite or by concatenating spin transport quaternions of individual elements as done in the program sprint @xcite . in the normal form space belonging to the diagonal matrix @xmath111",
    "the coordinates are given by the actions @xmath112 and the angle variables @xmath113 with @xmath114 the average over all angle variables of a phase space torus then leads to the average opening angle of @xmath115 where the @xmath116 are the 7th components of the eigenvectors in equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) .",
    "these opening angles are shown for desy  iii in figure [ fig : slim ]  ( top ) and it is apparent that at the places where resonant spin perturbations are described by a large resonance strength , the invariant spin field has a large opening angle .",
    "it is obvious when comparing with the resonance strength of figure [ fig : res ]  ( top ) that the influence of different resonances does not overlap in the linearized spin approximation . at petra energies of up to 40gev",
    ", the resonances already come very close to each other as seen when comparing figure [ fig : slim ]  ( middle ) with figure [ fig : res ]  ( middle ) and one can only barely expect an isolated resonance approximation to lead to accurate results",
    ". for high energies between 780 and 820gev / c in hera , figure [ fig : slim ]  ( bottom ) clearly shows that one can not speak of isolated resonances .",
    "often the influences of 4 resonances overlap .",
    "the approximation of linearized spin motion contains all first order orbital frequencies , since it linearized the precession vector @xmath52 with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "however , in contrast to the isolated resonance model , none of these resonances is ignored and the effect of overlapping resonances can be seen .",
    "it is possible to recover the first order isolated resonance strength from the one turn spin orbit transport matrix . in analogy to the complex notation for the spin component perpendicular to @xmath29 , the perturbing precession vector @xmath117 is expressed by a complex function @xmath118 as @xmath119 . inserting this into the thomas - bmt equation , one obtains @xmath120 in the case of spins which are nearly parallel to @xmath29 , one can linearize in @xmath43 and @xmath50 . for a spin which was initially parallel to @xmath29 one obtains @xmath121 .",
    "comparing with equation ( [ eq : res ] ) one can express the resonance strength as @xmath122 .",
    "the resonance strength can therefore be computed from @xmath123 for large @xmath124 .",
    "the computation becomes very efficient if one uses @xmath125 iteratively .",
    "the coordinate vectors @xmath126 and @xmath127 to which @xmath128 refers have rotated by the spin tune @xmath13 , whereas the final spin coordinate @xmath83 computed by @xmath85 refers to the coordinate vectors @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "therefore @xmath131 , and @xmath60 can be computed from powers of the one turn matrix , which can most efficiently be evaluated in diagonal form , @xmath132 \\underline a\\vec z\\\\ & = & ie^{-i2\\pi\\nu_0}g_la^{-1}_{lk}a_{km}z_m \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{2\\pi n}\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}e^{i 2\\pi j(\\nu_k-\\nu_0)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one has to sum over equal indices @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "this formula shows that the resonance strength is always zero , except at a resonance condition @xmath18 .",
    "at such a spin tune , the resonance strength is given by latexmath:[\\[2\\pi|\\epsilon_{\\nu_0=\\nu_k}| =        position @xmath133 . here",
    "@xmath137 is the initial value for a phase space trajectory which has only fourier components with frequencies @xmath138 plus integers and the @xmath133th eigenvector @xmath139 of @xmath87 has been used .",
    "the infinite fourier integral in equation ( [ eq : res ] ) has been reduced to the scalar product between the bottom vector of @xmath85 and an eigenvector of @xmath87 .",
    "this very simple formula is used in the program sprint .",
    "while one does not drop fourier coefficients in the approximation of linearized spin motion , there are other limitations .",
    "the approximation is no longer justified when @xmath140 becomes large , which happens close to resonances in the figures [ fig : slim ] .",
    "therefore the validity of linearized spin motion had to be be checked by computing the invariant spin field non - perturbatively . in the last few years",
    "two iterative higher order and three non - perturbative methods of computing the invariant spin field have been developed @xcite .",
    "all of these methods agree within their ranges of mutual applicability .",
    "the invariant spin field obtained from a non - perturbative method contains the effect of all fourier coefficients in @xmath52 . when comparing this spin field with @xmath92 , it was found that linearized orbit motion describes the opening angle and thus the maximum storeable polarization well in domains where the opening angle is small . at the critical energies , where the maximum polarization is low during the acceleration process , non - perturbative methods become essential for simulation and results obtained with the computationally quick linearization of spin motion",
    "should always be checked with more time consuming non - perturbative methods if possible .",
    "one application of this strategy is the filtering method @xcite .",
    "four or eight siberian snakes are inserted into hera to fix the spin tune to @xmath39 for all energies and to let @xmath29 be vertical in the flat arcs .",
    "these conditions do not fix all snake angles .",
    "currently there is , however , no established formula to determine good snake angles .",
    "since the opening angle of @xmath67 is such a critical quantity for high energy polarized proton acceleration , we have decided to maximize @xmath76 by choosing snake angles .",
    "a computer code was written which tested approximately @xmath141 snake schemes and computational speed was therefore essential . linearized spin motion was used to find the 8-snake - schemes with smallest average value of @xmath140 over the acceleration cycle .",
    "these filtered snake schemes then also had relatively small opening angles when computed non - perturbatively with stroboscopic averaging @xcite .",
    "two other indications showed that this filtering leads to good snake schemes .",
    "( 1 ) tracking simulations of the complete ramp process showed that the snake schemes found by filtering leads to less depolarization @xcite than other schemes which were initially proposed .",
    "( 2 ) computation of the amplitude dependent spin tune , which can only be performed when @xmath67 has been found non - perturbatively , shows that snakes schemes found by filtering have significantly less spin tune spread over orbital amplitudes than other proposed schemes @xcite . with the optimal scheme for four siberian snakes in hera it turned out to be possible to accelerate in computer simulations approximately 65% of the beam to high energy with little loss of polarization as long as no closed orbit distortions were present @xcite . in simulations , the current 1",
    "mm rms closed orbit distortions lead to depolarization @xcite .",
    "therefore either the closed orbit will have to be controlled more accurately or techniques which make the spin motion less sensitive to closed orbit distortion @xcite will have to be utilized ."
