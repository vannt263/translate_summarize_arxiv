    "thermally activated reactions appear in many contexts , including chemical reactions@xcite , cosmological phase transitions@xcite , and sphaleron - mediated baryon number violating transitions in the early universe@xcite .",
    "the physically important quantity in these transitions is the activation rate ; this sets the time scale for the process , and determines whether these reactions can be in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "there is a standard way of computing the activation rate in a field theory at finite temperature .",
    "consider a field theory with a metastable false vacuum state as well as a stable ground state .",
    "the first step in the calculation is to construct a static , extremal configuration , corresponding to a critical bubble , in which the field is near the true vacuum on the inside , and in the false vacuum outside the bubble .",
    "once this configuration is obtained , the activation rate @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the temperature , and @xmath1 is the free energy of the critical bubble .    in most applications , the bubble configuration used in practice is a static extremum of the _ classical _ action@xcite .",
    "however , this leaves open the question of how to incorporate quantum effects into the rate calculation@xcite .",
    "in particular , it is not clear whether the _ full _ theory has a critical bubble . even if it does , the relation between the rate obtained by the using the classical bubble and the rate we would calculate using the exact bubble is not altogether clear , to say the least .    in a general field theory ,",
    "it is usually impossible to construct the exact critical bubble of the theory , so that the questions asked above are moot .",
    "nonetheless , it would be of great interest to have some idea of how the exact and the approximate rates compare .",
    "it is for this reason that we consider the gross - neveu@xcite ( gn ) model in @xmath7 dimensions . in the presence of a chiral symmetry breaking term",
    ", the theory has a metastable ground state .",
    "of greater use to us , however , is the fact that we can obtain the _ exact _ critical bubble of the full quantum theory !",
    "being able to do this allows us to proceed with the program described above .",
    "in particular , there are _ no _ `` missing loops '' , or higher derivative corrections . while this is a theory in @xmath7 dimensions , the fact that it has much of the same richness as @xmath8 theories (  asymptotic freedom , dimensional transmutation , etc . )",
    "leads us to think that some of the results of this paper could be applicable to realistic field theories with metastable vacua in @xmath8 dimensions .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the gross - neveu model in detail .",
    "in particular , we exhibit the phase structure of the theory in the presence of an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term , and construct the exact bubble for this theory .",
    "we then proceed to compare the exponential part of the activation rate obtained from the exact bubble to that found from various commonly used approximations , such as the landau - ginzburg approximation , amongst others .",
    "we next calculate the activation rate in the presence of finite fermion number . here",
    "we find that beyond a critical baryon number , the activation barriers disappear completely .",
    "finally , section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider the lagrangian density for the n - flavor gross - neveu@xcite model in @xmath9 dimensions : @xmath10 with @xmath11 and a summation convention on @xmath12 is used .",
    "introducing an auxiliary ( hubbard - stratonovich ) scalar field @xmath13 , the lagrangian density becomes @xmath14    for @xmath15 the gross - neveu model has a _ discrete _ chiral symmetry : @xmath16 it is this symmetry that will be spontaneously broken ( only discrete symmetries can be spontaneously broken in @xmath7 dimensions ) .",
    "the explicit mass term @xmath17 introduces an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term and will be responsible for a non - degenerate vacuum structure .",
    "we should note that at tree level , the field @xmath18 has _ no _ dynamics ; it is truly an auxiliary field .",
    "however , it acquires dynamical content by dint of quantum effects arising from integrating out the fermions@xcite .",
    "let us first consider homogeneous configurations @xmath19 and the case of zero temperature . in order to understand this case clearly",

    "the ground state is obtained by filling up the negative energy dirac sea , so that the ground state energy density is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spatial length of the system and @xmath25 an upper momentum cutoff .",
    "dropping a term proportional to @xmath26 ( normal ordering ) the energy density becomes @xmath27 while the gap equation @xmath28 becomes @xmath29 clearly both the energy density and the gap equation need non - trivial renormalizations .",
    "we find that the proper renormalization conditions are @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an arbitrary renormalization scale .",
    "the renormalized gap equation now becomes : @xmath32    we see that for @xmath33 the gap equation generates dynamically a scale @xmath34 this solution to the gap equation has the lowest energy ( see below ) , thus spontaneously breaking the discrete chiral symmetry .",
    "it is convenient to absorb this dynamically generated scale as the overall scale in the problem and define all dimensionful quantities in terms of this scale .",
    "we thus introduce the following _ dimensionless _ quantities @xmath35 discarding terms independent of @xmath36 , the _ dimensionless _ energy density becomes @xmath37- \\frac{m m}{\\lambda_r } \\label{etaener}\\ ] ] and the gap equation becomes @xmath38 clearly , for @xmath39 the solution @xmath40 gives the lowest energy , thus the discrete chiral symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken .",

    "the extrema of the free energy are obtained from the gap equation : @xmath51 this equation can either have three solutions ( corresponding to a local minimum [ metastable state ] at @xmath52 , a maximum , and a global minimum [ stable state ] at @xmath53 of the free energy ) , or just one solution ( minimum ) .",
    "the left hand side of ( [ gap ] ) that determines the local minimum at @xmath54 is plotted in fig .  2 for various values of @xmath6 ; we see that solutions only exist for @xmath55 , and for a given @xmath56 only over a certain range of @xmath6 s (  for @xmath39 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "static topological and non - topological semiclassical solutions in the gross - neveu model have been analyzed and systematically constructed by dashen , hasslacher and neveu ( dhn)@xcite and campbell and liao@xcite using inverse scattering techniques .",

    "for the case @xmath39 ( explicit chiral symmetry ) there are two degenerate solutions to the gap equation . in this case there exist semiclassical topological soliton ( kink ) solutions and non - topological bubble ( polaron ) solutions@xcite .",
    "however when @xmath58 , the effective potential ( or free energy density ) has one local and one global minimum , the degeneracy is lifted by the explicit chiral symmetry breaking mass term and no soliton solutions are available . however , by taking the results from the degenerate case , it is straightforward to find that in the @xmath58 case there still exist bubble solutions for which the `` gap '' parameter @xmath18 ( and therefore @xmath36 ) is spatially varying .",

    "the position of the center of mass of the bubble is determined by @xmath65 .",
    "this variable reflects the underlying translational invariance of the system . because of this invariance , the energy ( or free energy ) is independent of this variable .",
    "for notational simplicity we will take it to be zero in the rest of the analysis .",
    "the fermion spectrum in presence of this non - topological semiclassical configuration is also known exactly@xcite : n bound states at energies @xmath66 and positive and negative energy continuum states with energies @xmath67 and phase - shifts @xmath68 with @xmath61 the solution of the integrability equation ( [ integcon ] ) .",
    "the exact fermionic wave - functions may be found in reference@xcite .",
    "a noteworthy feature of these wave - functions is that the bound - state fermionic wave - functions are localized at @xmath69 .",
    "it is known@xcite that in the presence of a topological soliton ( kink ) there are fermionic zero modes whose wave - functions are localized at the position of the kink . since the bubble configuration is reminiscent of a kink - antikink pair separated by a distance @xmath70 , the localized fermion bound - states are the symmetric and antisymmetric combination of the zero - mode wave - functions , split off in energy because of the non - zero overlap of these wave - functions .    the above configuration , being similar to a kink - antikink pair separated by a distance @xmath71 , can clearly be identified with a `` bubble '' .",
    "the value of @xmath47 ( the remaining unspecified parameter ) may be obtained by extremizing the energy of this configuration as a function of this parameter . for the moment",
    "we will leave this parameter free and treat it as a `` collective coordinate '' .    before proceeding to the numerical analysis of the bubble energy",
    ", it proves illuminating to understand some features of this configuration .",
    "asymptotically this solution reaches @xmath60 . for the global minimum @xmath72 and",
    "the integrability condition ( [ integcon ] ) implies that @xmath73 . in this case , in the region @xmath74 , the bubble samples a region where the free energy ( or energy ) density is _ higher _ than that of the global minimum ( for large @xmath47 , probing the metastable state ) .",
    "thus , for large @xmath47 , the energy as a function of @xmath47 will _ grow _ linearly ( because the difference of the tanh s is roughly constant in this region ) . on the other hand , if the bubble solution has its asymptotics in the _ metastable _ minimum for which @xmath75 , then @xmath76 and the bubble configuration is probing a region ( @xmath77 ) in which the free energy ( or energy ) density is _ lower _ , thus _ gaining _ volume energy . in this case for large @xmath47 the energy of the bubble configuration will _ diminish _ ( linearly for large @xmath78 ) .",
    "certainly for small @xmath47 the spatial variations of the bubble configuration will raise the energy , and since for large @xmath47 the energy will diminish , there has to be a maximum of the energy as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "this maximum , the critical bubble , thus corresponds to a `` sphaleron '' in the sense of manton and samols@xcite .",
    "the maximum of the energy as a function of the collective coordinate @xmath47 corresponds to a saddle point in functional space .",
    "the unstable coordinate corresponds to @xmath79 where @xmath80 corresponds to the maximum of the energy .",
    "the collective coordinate @xmath65 corresponding to the center of mass of the bubble is a flat direction in functional space , along which the energy is constant as a consequence of translational invariance .",

    "this is the classical `` volume '' energy contribution and arises primarily from the first ( integral ) term in ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the rest of the bracketed expression is the @xmath91 quantum contribution from the fermionic degrees of freedom , and saturates at a constant value for large @xmath78 .",
    "the remaining terms give the thermal contribution .",
    "we want to use the above results to calculate the activation rate between the metastable and the true vacua . our procedure will be as follows .",
    "we have an _ exact _ solution to the full , quantum equations of motion .",
    "to calculate the activation rate we can use the path integral formalism@xcite ; what we do is to saturate the path integral with the bubble configuration found above and evaluate the rate semiclassically .",
    "this is just the standard procedure that is commonly used .",
    "thus , when we say we are calculating the `` exact '' activation rate , we mean that we are using the exact solution to the full equations of motion to perform the semiclassical calculation of the rate . in the large @xmath92 approximation ,",
    "our calculation would become exact in _ all _ senses of the word .",
    "in the large n limit the gaussian fluctuations around the saddle point configuration yield a contribution of order @xmath93 and to leading order the prefactor is @xmath94 .",
    "however the free energy @xmath95 , with @xmath89 given by equation ( [ f2 ] ) , and the rate formally vanishes in this limit .    for finite",
    "n we should take into account the corrections from the gaussian fluctuations around the saddle point configuration , that is the prefactor , this is an extremely difficult task in this case .",
    "therefore , we only concentrate on the exponential since it gives the leading behavior and in this case it contains the _ quantum corrections _ associated with the fermionic loops , in particular in the case under consideration , the contribution to the exponential is _ solely _ arising from quantum corrections , since at tree level the auxiliary field has no dynamics .",
    "having clarified the nature of the approximations involved , we now set @xmath96 .    given @xmath56 and @xmath6 , then , we can plot @xmath97 as a function of @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and the maximum is @xmath98 .",
    "the superscript `` c '' indicates that this is the `` correct '' method of calculating the critical bubble free energy . up to a prefactor , the ( semiclassical ) activation rate is then @xmath99 . for @xmath100 , @xmath101",
    "is plotted as a solid curve in figs .",
    "now we turn to the main point of this work , which is to compare the _ exact _ critical free energy in the gn model to that obtained by means of various approximations .",
    "there are a variety of ways to approximate the free energy that enters into the activation rate .",
    "the class of schemes we consider involve approximating the kinetic term in various ways ( note that the theory written in terms of the auxiliary field @xmath18 has no canonical kinetic term at tree level ) as well as approximating the potential term .",
    "some of these schemes will have counterparts in the @xmath8 dimensional calculations of activation rates in scalar fields , while others are more specific to the gross - neveu model .      the bcs theory of superconductivity contains a four - fermi interaction which controls the formation of cooper pairs .",
    "a complex auxiliary field @xmath102 can be introduced to rewrite this four fermi interaction as a yukawa type coupling .",
    "this field then serves as an order parameter for the superconducting state .",
    "its dynamics can be determined by integrating out the fermions and constructing the effective action for @xmath102 . to understand the nature of the phase transition in this case , it is useful to perform a derivative expansion of the effective action near the critical temperature .",
    "this is the landau - ginzburg expansion@xcite .",
    "we can perform the same procedure for the gross - neveu model .",
    "the landau - ginzburg effective free energy is obtained as a consistent expansion in small order parameter ( @xmath36 ) and small gradients , and is valid near the critical temperature and for small explicit symmetry breaking fields ( small @xmath56 ) . in this approximation ( method `` l '' ) the effective free energy density is written up to terms of order @xmath103 in the derivative expansion and up to order @xmath104 in the non - derivative ( potential ) terms .",
    "the calculation of the lowest gradient term is obtained via a feynman diagram expansion to one loop using the imaginary time formulation of finite temperature field theory .",
    "it is carried out by writing @xmath105 with @xmath36 the _ homogeneous _ configuration , and @xmath106 ( the small departure from the homogeneous configuration ) taken to be a perturbation . due to the yukawa coupling of @xmath107 to the fermions , @xmath36 will be the mass of the fermions in the loop .",
    "the coefficient of the gradient term is the bracketed expression in : = p^2 v(p ) v(-p ) where @xmath48 was defined in .",
    "the diagram shows a fermion loop attached ( with coupling @xmath108 ) to two ( truncated ) scalar legs carrying spatial momentum @xmath109 .",
    "the field @xmath106 is taken to be independent of the matsubara frequencies , as well as slowly varying in space , in keeping with the philosophy of the derivative expansion . in the @xmath110 limit",
    "the bracketed expression is @xmath111 , while for @xmath112 it is [ using the expansion of ] @xmath113 .",
    "we have verified this calculation by means of chan s method of obtaining the derivative expansion@xcite .    using the quartic approximation ( for @xmath112 ) to the finite @xmath6 effective potential of ( see fig .",
    "4 ) yields the landau - ginzburg free energy density ( per flavor ) : ^lg = 7 ( 3)32 ^3 t^2 ( _ x m)^2 -m  m + m^22 + 7 ( 3 ) 32 ^ 3 m^4 t^2 this free energy density can be extremized with respect to @xmath107 , and it is found that the extremum inhomogeneous configuration is a bubble solution@xcite which is of the same form as the true extremal bubble , , with @xmath61 fulfilling exactly the _ same _ integrability condition as in .",
    "however , in this case , @xmath54 is the local minimum of the landau - ginzburg potential , and for this extremal bubble , k_0 ^ 2 = + 4 ^ 2 t^2 7(3 ) ( t e^- ) with @xmath114 , the total free energy of this inhomogeneous configuration in the landau - ginzburg approximation is f^l_c = 7 ( 3)4 ^3 t^2 k_0 ^ 3 the exponential part of the activation rate , @xmath115 , is plotted as a dashed curve in fig .  5 , along with the correct result @xmath101 ; from this graph we see that",
    "method `` l '' overestimates the rate up until the critical temperature where they both become equal to unity ( the critical temperatures are slightly different ) .",
    "this feature will recur in all the approximation schemes we use here , except for the last ( zero @xmath6 bubble ) .      in method `` g '' , the same landau - ginzburg potential is used , but only the @xmath91 gradient term is taken ,  the coefficient in front of the derivative term is @xmath116 .",
    "the critical bubble free energy is then given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 was given in .",
    "@xmath119 is plotted as a dashed curve in fig .",
    "this method is closer in spirit to the one used in the standard calculations@xcite of finite temperature activation rates for scalar field theories with canonical kinetic terms . in these calculations ,",
    "the canonical kinetic term is combined with the finite-@xmath6 effective potential to give the free energy relevant to the activation rate .      in the effective potential approxmation ( method `` p '' )",
    ", we define = x where @xmath120 was defined in . among configurations of the form [ and satisfying the integrability condition ] , parameterized by the half - width @xmath47 , we choose @xmath47 to extremize @xmath121 , and the resulting @xmath121 is our approximation to the critical free energy @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath123 is plotted as a dashed curve in fig .",
    "7 .    since _ classically _ there is no kinetic term in our lagrangian , , this method is tantamount to _ ignoring derivative corrections _ ( both quantum and thermal ) . in real - world calculations , such as that of the free energy of a critical bubble or the mass of a sphaleron ,",
    "derivative corrections are often ignored @xcite ; the finite-@xmath6 effective potential is combined with the classical ( canonical ) kinetic term , and the resulting approximate action is extremized .",
    "for example , the sphaleron mass at @xmath91 is known to be @xcite m_sp = 4v bg , ( b = 1.5 - 2.7 ) where @xmath108 is the minimum of the higgs potential . the sphaleron mass at finite @xmath6 is then approximated by the same formula but with @xmath124 , the minimum of the higgs effective potential [ and also @xmath125 .",
    "derivative corrections to the action have been ignored .      in the zero - t approximation ( method `` z '' )",
    ", the approximation scheme is as follows .",
    "we start by finding the @xmath91 critical bubble , a configuration of the form and , with @xmath54 the minimum of _ zero temperature _ effective potential , @xmath126 , choosing @xmath47 to extremize the @xmath91 free energy .",
    "then we plug this value of @xmath47 into the _ finite_-@xmath6 formula for the free energy , .",
    "@xmath127 is plotted as a dashed curve in fig .",
    "this is analogous to the method used for critical bubbles in @xcite . there",
    "the bubble configuration used was the extremum of the classical , @xmath91 action .",
    "the ( 1-loop ) finite-@xmath6 free energy of this bubble was then calculated ( exactly , including `` derivative corrections '' ) by numerically evaluating the determinant factor .    the purpose of ref .",
    "@xcite was to measure `` derivative corrections '' by comparing the zero-@xmath6 calculation ( which includes derivative corrections ) to the effective potential calculation ( which does not ) .",
    "this effort was hampered by the fact that the zero-@xmath6 calculation is itself an approximation ( only good at lower temperatures ) . in the gross - neveu model of this paper , we can compare both methods to the true result .",
    "if sphaleron configurations are relevant in baryon number violating processes , an important question to pose is how the presence of a finite baryon number modifies the field profile and the free energy barrier of the sphaleron configuration . within the model under consideration",
    "we can provide some partial answers to these questions .",
    "in this model we identify baryon number with fermion number . in order to consider a finite baryon number _ density _ at zero temperature we would have to allow for the case in which the n positive energy fermion bound states are occupied , and the rest of the baryons to be in the positive energy continuum up to a fermi energy ( or chemical potential ) .",
    "because the phase shifts of the continuum states depend on the bubble `` collective coordinate '' @xmath47 , to obtain the bubble profile for arbitrary @xmath47 , the fermi energy will have to be adjusted such as to provide the constant baryon density ( a constraint on the system ) .    at finite temperature",
    "we would have to introduce a chemical potential and work in the grand canonical ensemble , finally fixing the chemical potential ( as a function of temperature and bubble size ) to give the fixed baryon number density ( on average ) .",
    "both situations are extremely hard to implement and at the present time lie beyond our capabilities .",
    "we will content ourselves with considering the somewhat more restricted scenario in which we have a _",
    "fixed baryon number _ ( b ) , @xmath128 and the case of zero temperature .",
    "the reason that this case is somewhat simpler is that we can accommodate the @xmath129 baryons in the available n positive energy bound states .",
    "this corresponds to the ground state configuration with a finite ( positive ) baryon number @xmath130 ( for a negative baryon number we would have to deplete b _ negative _ energy bound states ) .",
    "following the steps leading to ( [ f2 ] ) at @xmath91 we find that the free energy becomes @xmath131 with @xmath132 given by equation ( [ f2 ] ) with @xmath91 .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize @xmath133 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "0   & \\leq           & \\theta \\leq \\pi /2 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath134 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath135 it proves more convenient to locate the size of the critical bubble by extremizing the free energy with respect to @xmath135 .",
    "the extremum condition leads to @xmath136 as we have analyzed in section two , the metastable minimum is available only for @xmath137 .",
    "thus we find that for @xmath138 there are two _ non - trivial _ extrema of the energy functional .",
    "clearly one corresponds to a minimum and the other to the maximum , i.e. the critical bubble .",
    "the free energy barrier between the minimum and the maximum becomes smaller as @xmath129 is increased , finally disappearing at a maximum baryon number given by @xmath139 where @xmath139 is found using @xmath140 in .",
    "for @xmath141 the barrier disappears altogether and there is no longer a bubble solution .",
    "this is indeed a remarkable result if it persists in three dimensions .",
    "the physics of this phenomenon is clear . by filling up the allowed positive energy bound states the pauli pressure ( a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle ) increases . for the minimum which appears at a _ smaller _ bubble radius",
    "this pressure is larger than that for the maximum , which appears for a larger bubble radius .",
    "although extrapolation to three dimensions is not warranted , we would expect fermionic bound states in the lowest ( @xmath142 ) partial wave , because in this partial wave the problem is essentially one - dimensional ( save for the fact that the wave function must satisfy proper boundary conditions at the origin )",
    ". if the effect of these fermionic bound states localized at the wall of the bubble is consistent with the behavior just found in this @xmath7 dimensional model , it would imply that the current bounds on sphaleron transitions may be a gross _ underestimate _ for the rate .",
    "clearly we can not conclude that this happens in the more realistic three dimensional scenario , but we believe that this observation may be worthy of consideration there as previous estimates did not take into account the fermionic back - reaction onto the sphaleron configuration and their effect on the activation barriers .",
    "the amazing thing about the gn model is that one can calculate the _ exact _ critical bubble configuration of the theory and hence we can deduce the true ( modulo our statements about the semiclassical evaluation of the relevant path integral ) value of the activation rate ( or at least its exponential part , which typically is the most important part of the rate ) .",

    "we see that the landau - ginzburg method ( `` l '' ) and the potential method ( `` p '' ) converge nicely to the correct result ( `` c '' ) at high temperatures .",
    "they both correctly predict @xmath145 , though their respective critical temperatures vary slightly from the correct @xmath146 ; we would only expect exact agreement if the phase transition were second order ( the limit @xmath147 ) .",
    "the zero - t method ( `` z '' ) is a poor approximation at higher temperatures , but is better at lower @xmath6 s .",
    "curiously , all the approximation schemes tend to overestimate the rate .",
    "finally , we have to address the question of what this means for realistic field theories in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "since the gn model was so special in that we could find the exact bubbles , etc .",
    ", one might be tempted to think that our results should only hold for this model .",
    "while we have no evidence that this is not the case , it should be recalled that the gn model serves as a very good testing ground for issues such as asymptotic freedom , which does in fact occur in @xmath8 field theories .",
    "it is also the inspiration for nambu - jona - lasinio low energy effective models for strong interactions .",
    "thus , our results may have a wider range of applicability to theories in higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , if the various sphaleron configurations in higher dimensional theories can sustain fermionic bound states , then we expect that our discussion of the activation rate in the presence of finite fermion number should apply .",
    "this would be of great importance since the reduction of the barrier would have significant consequences for the activation rate .    at any rate ,",
    "what our results _ do _ show is that the standard methods of calculating the activation rate need not be all that close to the exact value ; if nothing else , our calculation can serve as a warning sign to those who might believe their approximations overly much .",
