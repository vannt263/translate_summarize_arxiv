    "the numerical study of the binary black hole problem has recently made significant progress @xcite .",
    "it is now possible to calculate the evolution of a wide variety of astrophysical scenarios . in order to do this ,",
    "appropriate initial data for the einstein equations are necessary , such that they describe the initial conditions of these scenarios .",
    "a natural physical requirement for binary black hole initial data is that in the limit of large separation distance each of the black holes approximates an stationary , isolated , black hole ( in vacuum , this implies that the black hole approximates the kerr black hole ) .",
    "otherwise , the data will contain spurious radiation which can in principle contaminate the final waveform ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the nonlinearity of the constraint equations makes the problem of constructing initial data satisfying such far limit a nontrivial one . in @xcite",
    "such data for two kerr black holes with far limit has been constructed .",
    "the procedure uses the conformal method for solving the constraint equations ( see the review article @xcite and references therein ) . in this construction , one starts by constructing a superposition of two conformal kerr metrics to get a new conformal metric , which is then used as a ` seed ' metric for the conformal method .",
    "then , a conformal factor is calculated such that the corresponding rescaled metric satisfies the constraint equations . the existence and uniqueness of that conformal factor can be proved provided the ` seed ' metric satisfies an important requirement : its yamabe invariant must be positive ( see @xcite for a discussion about the yamabe invariant in the context of the constraint equations ) . in order to ensure this condition in @xcite , it has been assumed that the individual angular momentum parameters of the black holes are small with respect to the masses .",
    "this assumption is , of course , an undesirable restriction . highly spinning black holes are relevant in many astrophysical situations .",
    "a remarkable example of this are the large merger recoil kicks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to overcome this restriction for the axially symmetric case .",
    "we provide an explicit metric , having three ` ends ' , which is constructed as a superposition of two kerr black holes metrics ( with aligned or anti aligned angular momentum ) .",
    "when the mass parameters of one black hole is zero then the metric reduces exactly to the kerr metric . in this sense",
    ", we say that the metric satisfies the far limit .",
    "the important property of this metric is that when the separation distance between the black holes is large enough its ricci scalar is positive .",
    "the parameters of the individual kerr black holes are only restricted by the kerr inequality @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the angular momentum per mass unit and @xmath2 is the mass of the individual black hole .",
    "that is , the angular momentum is not assumed to be small .",
    "instead , we assumed the physical reasonable condition that the separation distance between them is large .",
    "this constitutes the main result of the article .    when the three ` ends ' are asymptotically flat ( the non - extreme cases ) the positivity of the ricci scalar implies the positivity of the corresponding yamabe invariant .",
    "and hence the metric can be used as a seed metric for the construction mentioned above . in this way",
    "axially symmetric initial data can be constructed for two kerr - like black holes with large angular momentum .",
    "however , we emphasize that our result covers also the extreme limit @xmath3 of any of the black holes .",
    "we believe that this can be used to construct ( the still unknown ) initial data for two extreme kerr black holes .",
    "consider the kerr black hole ( i.e. the kerr metric such that @xmath4 ) in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "take any constant @xmath5 slice in these coordinates and denote by @xmath6 the intrinsic 3-dimensional metric of the slice .",
    "there exist spatial coordinates @xmath7 on the slice such that the metric @xmath6 has the following form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( which do not depend on the coordinate @xmath12 ) are explicitly given by equations ( [ eq:51 ] ) in the appendix [ sec : kerr - data ] .",
    "the slice is a 3-dimensional manifold @xmath13 which has the topology @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the origin in the coordinates @xmath7 . for the results presented here a relevant property of the kerr metric",

    "we construct a new manifold @xmath17 by removing two points from @xmath18 denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , namely @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath7 be cylindrical coordinates on @xmath17 such that the two points @xmath19 and @xmath20 are located at the axis @xmath22 , separated by coordinate distance @xmath23 .",
    "this requirement does not completely fix the coordinate system , since there still is a translation freedom in the @xmath24 coordinate @xmath25 where @xmath26 is any arbitrary constant . later on",
    "we will make use off this freedom to simplify the computations .",
    "however , for the formulation of the results there is no loss off generality if we chose the coordinate system such that @xmath19 is located at @xmath27 and @xmath20 at @xmath28 on the @xmath24 coordinate axis .    given the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 of the kerr initial data , with parameters @xmath31 , we define the new functions @xmath32 by @xmath33 in the same way , for functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 we define @xmath36 by @xmath37    with this set of functions constructed from the kerr metric , we define a metric on @xmath17 , depending on the parameters @xmath38 , by @xmath39 where @xmath40 since @xmath41 and @xmath42 are positive functions , @xmath43 is well defined as a metric on @xmath17 for any choice of the parameter @xmath23 .    for",
    "the non - extreme case ( i.e @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) one can check that the metric @xmath43 is asymptotically flat with three asymptotic ends .",

    "the total mass of the metric ( [ brillsuma ] ) at the end @xmath46 is given by @xmath53 .",

    "for @xmath63 we have @xmath64 . in this limit",

    "theorem [ t : main ] implies that @xmath71 ( it is obvious that @xmath72 , to prove that it is strictly positive we use lemma 4.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the main application of theorem [ t : main ] is the construction of a two ( non - extreme ) kerr black holes data .",

    "theorem [ t : main ] allows to generalize these results for any @xmath1 such that @xmath73 , but only for the axially symmetric case ( that is , when the angular momentum of the black holes are aligned or anti aligned ) . using the conformal method and the metric ( [ brillsuma ] ) as a ` seed ' conformal metric",
    "the complete data can be obtained as follows . since",
    "this procedure involves standard applications of known results we only sketch the proof .",
    "first we superpose two extrinsic curvatures from two kerr initial data .",
    "this can be done in general ( see @xcite ) , however in axial symmetry the procedure is much simpler and can be done explicitly ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "then , we use existence theorems for the lichnerowicz equation ( see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to prove that there exists a new conformal factor such that a conformal rescaling of the metric @xmath74 satisfies the vacuum constraint equations with the above constructed second fundamental form ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is in this last step when theorem [ t : main ] plays an important role . in order to apply these existence theorems",
    "we need to ensure that the conformal metric has positive yamabe invariant . using theorem [ t : main ]",
    "we only require that the separation distance between the black holes is large .",
    "we also note that although this procedure is identical to the one proposed in @xcite , the ` seed ' conformal metric is different .",
    "the above construction applies to the non - extreme case .",
    "remarkably , theorem [ t : main ] is valid also for the extreme case @xmath75 .",
    "it is very likely that this theorem can also be used to construct a superposition of two extreme kerr black holes . but this remains to be seen .",
    "the existence results for the lichnerowicz equations proved so far in the literature applies only to asymptotically flat manifolds and not to manifolds with cylindrical ends like extreme kerr .",
    "in this section we establish the three key properties of kerr intrinsic metric which allow us to prove theorem [ t : main ] in the next section .",
