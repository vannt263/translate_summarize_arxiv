    "psr j0218@xmath04232 is a 2.3 ms pulsar in a two day orbit around a low mass ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) white dwarf companion @xcite .",
    "pulsed x - ray emission with a crab - like double pulse profile has been reported from rosat 0.1 - 2.4 kev data @xcite and bepposax mecs 1.6 - 10 kev data @xcite .",
    "the pulsed spectrum as measured by the mecs appeared to be remarkably hard with a power - law photon index @xmath8 , harder than measured for any other radio pulsar .",
    "furthermore , @xcite report the detection with egret of pulsed high - energy ( 0.1 - 1 gev ) @xmath4-ray emission from this ms pulsar .",
    "their argument is based on three lines of evidence : ( 1 ) the 0.1 - 1 gev data show a 3.5@xmath5 pulsation at the radio period ; ( 2 ) the @xmath4-ray light curve resembles the one seen in hard x - rays , namely a phase separation of @xmath9 0.45 between two pulses / maxima ; ( 3 ) the spatial analysis shows that the position of the egret source 3eg j0222 + 4253 moves from the position of the nearby bl lac 3c 66a towards the pulsar position with decreasing gamma - ray energy ( for energies between 100 and 300 mev all source counts could be attributed to psr j0218 + 4232 ) .",
    "they also showed that the two @xmath4-ray pulses / maxima appeared to be aligned in absolute phase with two of the three radio pulses detected at 610 mhz .",
    "unfortunately , the timing accuracies of the rosat and bepposax observations were insufficient to construct x - ray profiles in absolute phase .",
    "none of the current models for pulsed x - ray and @xmath4-ray emission from radio pulsars offers a consistent explanation for the above summarized high - energy results on psr j0218@xmath04232 @xcite .",
    "psr j0218@xmath04232 is also remarkable in that it is the only crab - like ms pulsar with a large dc ( unpulsed ) fraction of @xmath10 in the rosat band below 2.4 kev @xcite , as well as a large dc fraction of @xmath11 in radio , systematically over the range 100 - 1400 mhz @xcite .",
    "the dc components as measured in the rosat and radio observations could be explained by emission from a compact nebula with diameter @xmath12 , but in both cases the indications were at the limit of the imaging capabilities . assuming that the radio dc component is compact , combined with the measured very broad and structured radio pulse profile , @xcite suggested that the magnetic field of psr j0218@xmath04232 is almost aligned with the rotation axis , the observer viewing the system under a small angle with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "@xcite measured the magnetic inclination angle analyzing radio polarization profiles .",
    "their rotation vector model fits indicate that the magnetic inclination angle is indeed consistent with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "unfortunately , in their fits the line - of - sight inclination is unconstrained .",
    "if the dc component in x - rays is also compact , for the suggested geometry of a nearly aligned rotator and a small viewing angle , it can originate in the pulsar magnetosphere as well as from a heated polar cap of the neutron star .",
    "the objectives of our chandra observations were : 1 ) to establish the spatial extent of the x - ray dc component , compact or extended ; 2 ) to construct an x - ray pulse profile which can be compared in absolute phase with radio profiles and the 3.5@xmath5 egret high - energy ( 0.1 - 1 gev ) @xmath4-ray profile .",
    "psr j0218@xmath04232 was observed with the hrc - i and hrc - s instruments on the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) during two observations of @xmath15 ks duration each .",
    "the hrcs are multi - channel plate ( mcp ) detectors sensitive to x - rays in the 0.08 - 10 kev energy range with no spectral information .",
    "the first observation with the hrc - i camera at the focal plane of the telescope mirror took place on 1999 december 22 for an effective exposure of 74.11 ks .",
    "unfortunately , this observation suffered from a non - recoverable timing ( `` wiring '' ) problem assigning incorrectly the event trigger time to that of the next trigger @xcite . on - board",
    "event screening prevents recovering the true event times of all the triggers in the telemetry stream by simple back - shifting .",
    "the timing accuracy in this case is determined by the total event rate , typically 300 - 400 s@xmath16 , and is much worse than the @xmath17s intrinsic timing resolution .",
    "this degradation prevents the construction of high - resolution pulse profiles in case of millisecond pulsars .    in a re - observation of psr j0218@xmath04232 on 2000",
    "october 5 for an effective exposure of 73.21 ks with the hrc - s in imaging mode ( using only the central mcp segment ) all event triggers could be put in the telemetry stream , so that back - shifting recovers the intrinsic timing accuracy .",
    "psr j0218@xmath04232 has clearly been detected near the centre of the @xmath18 field of view in the 74.11 ks hrc - i observation . within @xmath19 from the pulsar",
    "51 x - ray sources have been detected , some of them have counterparts in our previous rosat hri ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) and bepposax mecs ( 1.6 - 10 kev ) observations @xcite .",
    "the central @xmath20 part of the x - ray image containing psr j0218@xmath04232 has also been observed at optical wavelengths by the keck telescope @xcite and it turns out that all central sources except one have optical counterparts .",
    "relative astrometry demonstrates that the chandra positions are accurate to within @xmath21 , better than the celestial localization accuracy determination requirement of @xmath22 . using the standard level 1 event file provided by the cxc pipeline analysis ( this file contains all hrc triggers with the position information corrected for instrumental ( de - gap ) and aspect ( dither ) effects ) , a zoom - in at the pulsar location ( fig .",
    "[ hrcispatial ] left ) shows that the x - ray centroid has a @xmath23 offset from the radio - pulsar position of @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( epoch j2000 ) consistent with our previous findings .",
    "it is also evident from the image shown in fig .",
    "[ hrcispatial ] ( left ) that the source events are concentrated within a circle with a radius of @xmath26 from the x - ray centroid .",
    "a more quantitative estimate involves maximum likelihood fitting of the measured 2d spatial distribution with a model composed of a gaussian and a generalized lorentzian with free shape parameters , normalization and centroid position on top of an ( assumed ) flat background , also with free scale factor .",
    "the optimum x - ray centroid position is @xmath27,@xmath28 ( epoch j2000 ) while the radial profile of the best model fit is compatible with the psf of the hrma / hrc - i combination ( 95% of the source counts are within @xmath29 from the x - ray centroid ) .",
    "[ hrcispatial ] ( right ) shows the best model profile ( dotted line ) superposed on the measured radial profile using the optimum x - ray centroid position as centre .",
    "thus , we have no evidence for extended emission near psr j0218@xmath04232 at @xmath30 scales ( diameter ) , rejecting the indication for a compact nebula found in our analysis of rosat hri data @xcite .",
    "the total number of counts assigned to the pulsar from the maximum likelihood fit is @xmath31 , which translates in a count rate of @xmath32 . assuming absorption in a column with density @xmath33 cm @xmath34 @xcite and a photon power - law index of @xmath35 @xcite the count rate converts to a 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath36 erg cm@xmath34s@xmath16 .",
    "the first error represents the statistical error and the second the systematic error due to uncertainties in the absolute sensitivity of the hrc - i and in the spectral model .",
    "the value is consistent with the bepposax mecs value of @xmath38 erg cm@xmath34s@xmath16 ( the first error represents the statistical uncertainty and the second error the systematic uncertainty of about 10% ) .",
    "in a spatial analysis using the hrc - s level 1 event file the x - ray centroid of the x - ray counterpart of psr j0218@xmath04232 was found to have an offset of @xmath39 from the radio position of the pulsar , larger than the celestial location accuracy determination requirement of @xmath22 ; a systematic difference noticed earlier by e.g. @xcite .",
    "the number of counts assigned to the source , applying a similar likelihood procedure as in the case of the hrc - i image data , is @xmath40 . using the optimized background scale factor and source profile , the optimum radius for event extraction ( s / n optimal ) from the best fit centroid turns out to be @xmath41 .",
    "the first step in the timing analysis is to correct the assigned event times by back - shifting , recovering the intrinsic relative time resolution of @xmath17s .",
    "next , the event extraction radius was set to the optimum radius of @xmath41 .",
    "the final step is the determination of the arrival times at the solar system barycentre using the orbital information of chandra and the position of psr j0218@xmath04232 .",
    "folding the barycentered arrival times with the spin and binary parameters from an updated ephemeris for psr j0218@xmath04232 revealed the well - known doubled peaked profile at high statistics ( fig.[hrcspulseprof ] ) .",
    "the deviation from a flat distribution is @xmath42 according to a @xmath43 - test and the peak separation is @xmath44 consistent with previous estimates @xcite .",
    "the peak widths @xmath45 ( fwhm ) , fitting the profile in terms of two asymmetric lorentzians atop a flat background , are : peak-1 ( at @xmath46 ) @xmath47 ( @xmath48s ) and peak-2 ( at @xmath49 ) @xmath50 ( @xmath51s ) .",
    "fitting two gaussians plus background yielded similar results .    in fig.[hrcspulseprof ] is indicated an estimate for the unpulsed ( dc ) level ( @xmath52 ) using a bootstrap method outlined by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the background level estimated in the maximum likelihood imaging analysis is also shown , giving a number of background counts within the @xmath41 extraction radius of @xmath53 .",
    "the pointlike ( see sect .",
    "3 ) dc ( unpulsed ) component , significantly detected with rosat ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ; @xmath54 ) by @xcite and weakly with bepposax ( 1.6 - 4.0 kev ; @xmath55 ) by @xcite is clearly seen in this 0.08 - 10 kev profile .",
    "the pulsed fraction @xmath56 defined as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 specifies the number of pulsed source counts and @xmath59 the number of dc source counts , turns out to be @xmath60 as measured by cxo hrc - s over the entire 0.08 - 10 kev energy range .",

    "firstly , because we generated an ephemeris valid for all used observation periods and applied a common reference epoch ( see table [ ephemeris ] ) , and secondly , the absolute timing accuracy of cxo is within @xmath68s @xcite which corresponds to a phase inaccuracy smaller than @xmath69 given the pulse period of @xmath70 ms .",
    "[ hepulsprofstack ] shows then for the first time the comparison of a psr j0218@xmath04232 x - ray profile in absolute phase with the radio and @xmath4-ray profiles . within the uncertainties of each of the measurements",
    "the x - ray pulses are aligned with two of the three radio pulses at 610 mhz and with the @xmath4-ray pulses .",
    "the alignment in absolute phase of the very - hard x - ray pulses with the low - significance @xmath4-ray pulses is particularly interesting .",
    "the calculated 3.5@xmath5 significance of the @xmath4-ray profile was derived for _ unbinned _ data giving the statistical evidence ( @xmath71 - test ) for deviations from a flat distribution _ anywhere _ in pulsar phase . when we calculate the significance of detection of the two @xmath4-ray pulses at the _ known _",
    "absolute phases of the x - ray pulses ( e.g. by determining the pulsed excess counts in the narrow pulse phase windows @xmath72  @xmath73 and @xmath74  @xmath75 , considering the remaining phase windows ( 65% ) as background ; we found @xmath76 pulsed excess counts ) then we derive for this single trial an increased total significance of 4.0@xmath5 .    in fact , we performed simulations similar to what we did earlier for psr b1951@xmath032 @xcite : we simulated @xmath77 flat phase distributions with the same number of counts ( @xmath78 ) as contained in the egret 0.1 - 1 gev phase histogram shown in fig .",
    "[ hepulsprofstack]c .",
    "then we applied the @xmath71 - test and verified first that the distribution of the @xmath71 simulations behaved as expected for a random distribution ( with @xmath77 trials we could calibrate well up to @xmath79 ) .",
    "next , we used again the two narrow pulse phase windows @xmath72  @xmath80 and @xmath74  @xmath75 to determine the pulsed excess counts . fig . [ egretlcsim ] shows in a two - dimensional distribution all simulations with a @xmath71 - significance above 3@xmath5 versus the measured pulsed excess counts in the pre - defined pulse windows . as can be seen , only for one simulation out of @xmath77 a significance above 3.5@xmath5 _ and _ pulsed excess counts above 55 was reached .",
    "this corresponds to a statistical significance of @xmath9 4.9@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we take the alignment in absolute phase of the non - thermal x - ray and @xmath4-ray pulses as supporting evidence for our first detection of high - energy @xmath4-rays from a millisecond pulsar .",
    "in the spatial and timing analyses we derived the main results from our chandra data , which contain very limited spectral information . essentially , we measured the integral count rate over the entire 0.08 - 10 kev energy window .",
    "therefore , we can not add significant new information to the well - defined pulsed spectrum as measured by the bepposax mecs instrument @xcite .",
    "however , no meaningful information has been published sofar on the spectral shape of the dc component ( crucial to decide on the origin and production mechanism ) , while the combined rosat hri , bepposax mecs and chandra data can give a first estimate : the rosat hri provides us a dc count rate for 0.1 - 2.4 kev , the mecs for 1.6 - 4 kev and 4 - 10 kev , and chandra for 0.08 - 10 kev .    assuming a spectral model and absorbing column n@xmath81 and using the instrument sensitivity curves over the different energy windows , the hrc - s dc count rate can be used to predict the rosat hri and bepposax mecs dc count rates .    for a black body model the measured rosat",
    "hri / hrc - s rates demand a temperature kt @xmath82 kev ; the measured bepposax mecs / hrc - s rates @xmath83 kt @xmath84 ( @xmath85 limits ) .",
    "therefore , a thermal model with a temperature @xmath83 kt @xmath82 ( 90% confidence interval : 0.33 - 1.1 kev ) is consistent with all the measured dc count rates .",
    "assuming a power - law model , the dc rates of the three instruments are consistent with power - law indices in the range 1.3 - 1.85 ( @xmath85 limits ; 90% confidence interval 0.95 - 2.45 ) , significantly softer than for the pulsed emission ( @xmath8 ) as measured by the mecs @xcite .",
    "the total statistics of the data are insufficient to discriminate between the black body and the power - law spectral shapes .",
    "our first objective of the chandra observations was to determine the spatial extent of the x - ray dc component and to find a likely explanation for its origin . as is shown in fig . 1",
    ", no evidence for extended emission near psr j0218@xmath04232 at @xmath30 scales ( diameter ) is seen , rejecting the indication for a compact nebula found in our analysis of rosat hri data @xcite .",
    "the combined rosat , bepposax mecs and chandra data led us to conclude that the dc spectrum is significantly softer than the pulsed spectrum , the latter being clearly of non - thermal origin . if we adopt the geometry proposed by @xcite , a nearly aligned rotator and a small viewing angle , the soft dc x - ray component can be explained as thermal emission from the polar cap of the neutron star which stays visible to the observer all the time . for old millisecond",
    "pulsars the thermal emission can only originate from reheating of the polar cap area by back - flowing accelerated particles . in fact , for a ms - pulsar the polar - cap half angle @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) extends over a relatively large angle , e.g. @xmath88 for psr j0218@xmath04232 .",
    "this means that the spin - axis is well within the ( magnetic ) polar - cap region , for the measured angle between the spin- and magnetic axes amounts @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , a small observer viewing angle to the system ( angle spin - axis and line of sight ) can keep the observer looking at the heated polar region continuously .",
    "the @xcite radio observations had a vla beam size of @xmath91 , also allowing an interpretation of the radio dc component ( reported dc fraction @xmath11 ) as a compact nebula up to the size of the vla beam .",
    "no new observations have been reported with a smaller beam size , but @xcite and @xcite revisited the pulsed emission .",
    "we fitted the total radio spectrum of @xcite ( five data points ) with a power - law shape , index @xmath92 , and the new total pulsed radio spectrum ( three data points from @xcite , two from @xcite and one from @xcite ) , index @xmath93 .",
    "the spectra appeared identical in shape and the updated dc fraction is @xmath94 , significantly lower than the earlier estimate .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the radio dc component is most likely also compact and has the same magnetospheric origin as the pulsed emission , which has a very structured and remarkably broad profile and is indeed practically never `` off '' .",
    "our second objective was to obtain with chandra a more significant x - ray profile than measured sofar , to study the profile structure in more detail in the x - ray band below 10 kev , and to have for the first time absolute timing , allowing multiwavelengths phase comparisons .",
    "the profile in fig .",
    "[ hrcspulseprof ] with a significance of @xmath42 is indeed much more significant than the mecs profile ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "now we can really see that the two pulses have broad wings and that the profile reaches the dc level only in a very narrow phase interval around phase 0.35 ( phase extent @xmath2 ) .",
    "in fact , fig.[hepulsprofstack ] shows that the radio and the x - ray profiles both reach a minimum level for approximately the same _ absolute _ phase region .",
    "furthermore , fig.[hepulsprofstack ] shows that the x - ray pulses are aligned in absolute phase with two of the three radio pulses and the two @xmath4-ray pulses within the timing uncertainties of the different measurements .",
    "psr j0218@xmath04232 is the first and only millisecond pulsar for which we reported evidence for detection of high - energy gamma - ray emission up to 1 gev @xcite .",
    "we take the alignment in absolute phase of the non - thermal x - ray and @xmath4-ray pulses as important supporting evidence for our first detection of high - energy @xmath4-rays from a millisecond pulsar . in sect .",
    "5 we showed that the probability that a random timing signal reaches a @xmath96 modulation significance _ and _ has its 55 pulsed excess counts in phase with the two x - ray pulses amounts @xmath97 .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of short - term variability in the high - energy @xmath4-ray emission from 3eg j0222 + 4253 ( 3c66a / psr j0218@xmath04232 ) in a systematic search for all 170 unidentified sources in the 3rd egret catalog @xcite .",
    "they noted that if this flaring is due to psr j0218@xmath04232 :  it would be an unusual source in two ways : it would be the only millisecond pulsar seen by egret and the only pulsar to show strong flaring \" .",
    "we argue , however , that in their search the reported evidence for flaring is not significant : for each of the 170 unidentified sources @xcite produced light curves per viewing period ( vp ) with 2 day flux values each time they were in the field - of - view during a vp . for 3eg j0222 + 4253 ( 3c66a / psr j0218@xmath04232 ) they found the most significant evidence for variability , namely in vp15 with a variability index v=2.6 , corresponding to a @xmath98 significance for a random detection in a _",
    "single _ trial assuming gaussian statistics ( although poisson statistics apply ) .",
    "this variability was due to one single high 2 day flux value .",
    "however , this source was viewed in 4 observations ( no indication for variability in the other vps ) which makes the probability ( @xmath99 ) 1% or 2.58@xmath5 to find v=2.6 in 1 out of 4 observations .",
    "furthermore , @xcite analysed 144 vps with duration larger than 3 days producing for the 170 unidentified sources few - hundred light curves , making the probability to find once v=2.6 ( or one single high 2 day flux value ) few times unity !",
    "they correctly noted that their monte carlo probabilities give misleading values ( too optimistic ) as the used averages having no uncertainties assigned .",
    "also in the latter case the very large number of `` trials '' has been ignored .",
    "since there was no _ a priori _ reason to select 3eg j0222 + 4253 for a single trial , we donot regard the indication for short - term variability of this source significant .",
    "the x - ray results on the dc emission and the radio results on the dc and pulsed emission suggest for psr j0218@xmath04232 an emission scenario of a nearly aligned rotator and a small viewing angle .",
    "the latter angle can still be as large as @xmath100 to explain the x - ray dc emission if this originates from a polar - cap heated by particle bombardment .",
    "for explaining the pulse profile with two hard - spectrum x - ray/@xmath4-ray peaks it is more critical to know this viewing angle to get a handle on the geometry . for both competing classes of models , polar cap models ( pc ;",
    "e.g. @xcite ) and outer gap models ( og ; see e.g. @xcite ) production of hard x - ray/@xmath4-ray emission in the magnetospheres of millisecond pulsars has been predicted ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , millisecond pulsars among them psr j0218@xmath04232 were considered for pc models by @xcite . for psr j0218@xmath04232",
    "they did not succeed in reproducing the measured high - energy spectral shape .",
    "more recently , @xcite succeeded in reproducing the high - energy spectrum of psr j0218@xmath04232 , but required non - orthodox assumptions about the electron energy distribution or emission altitude as well as off - beam viewing geometry .",
    "@xcite reproduced the double - peak profile with the measured phase separation for a small inclination angle of @xmath101 and a viewing angle of @xmath102 ( angles approximately consistent with our findings ) .",
    "however , for these angles the spectrum reached its maximum luminosity for too high energies around 100 gev .",
    "the fact that in the case of pc models a double - peak hard x - ray/@xmath4-ray profile can be modelled for a nearly aligned rotator with a @xmath100 viewing angle follows already from @xcite , who showed that the @xmath4-ray beam produced at the polar cap rim is relatively wide , amounting @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) for psr j0218@xmath04232 .",
    "for emission produced at higher altitudes in the magnetosphere ( as is proposed in the more recent versions of pc models ) , the beam will become even wider .",
    "in all these discussions the real viewing angle in combination with the inclination angle determines whether the measured double peak profile can be obtained .",
    "also for og models a double peak profile is in principle possible , depending on the actual viewing angle and which part of the outer gap ( in altitude ) is visible to the observer .",
    "for og models the hard x - ray/@xmath4-ray cone might become too broad for the case of psr j0218@xmath04232 as a nearly aligned rotator if the hard x - ray/@xmath4-ray production takes place only close to the light cylinder .",
    "however , @xcite argued recently that the @xmath4-ray production is not limited to regions in the outer gap above the null - charge surface , but can also originate from altitudes closer to the neutron star .",
    "more detailed model calculations are required to solve the present uncertainties in the overall interpretation of the data .",
    "this underlines the importance of a new attempt to determine the geometry from radio polarization data .",
    "then detailed model calculations starting from this geometry can attempt to reproduce all the remarkable timing and spectral results obtained for this millisecond pulsar .",

    "<S> we report on high - resolution spatial and timing results for binary millisecond pulsar psr j0218@xmath04232 obtained with the chandra hrc - i and hrc - s in imaging mode . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - arcsecond resolution image of the hrc - i ( 0.08 - 10 kev ) showed that the x - ray emission from psr j0218@xmath04232 is consistent with that of a point source excluding the presence of a compact nebula with a size of about @xmath1 for which we had indications in rosat hri data . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a dc component is confirmed . this x - ray dc component has a softer spectrum than the pulsed emission and can be explained by emission from a heated polar cap . with our hrc - s observation </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a 0.08 - 10 kev pulse profile with high statistics showing the well - known double peaked morphology in more detail than before : the two pulses have broad wings and pulsed emission appears only to be absent in a narrow phase window of width @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute timing accuracy of @xmath3s makes it possible to compare for the first time in absolute phase the x - ray pulse profile with the highly structured radio profile and the high - energy @xmath4-ray profile ( 0.1 - 1 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two x - ray pulses are aligned within absolute timing uncertainties with two of the three radio pulses . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the two @xmath4-ray pulses are aligned with the two non - thermal x - ray pulses , corresponding to a probability for a random occurrence of 4.9@xmath5 , strengthening the credibility of the earlier reported first detection of pulsed high - energy @xmath4-ray emission from a ( this ) millisecond pulsar . </S>"
