    "determining the masses of the accreting black holes ( bhs ) in ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) is a key unsolved problem in x - ray astrophysics . in the absence of direct kinematic measurements of their mass functions , indirect methods based on x - ray spectral modelling",
    "have sometimes been used , by analogy with galactic bh x - ray binaries , whose spectra can be approximated , in the `` canonical '' @xmath8@xmath9 kev range , with a thermal component plus a power - law .",
    "the thermal component is consistent with disk - blackbody emission from an optically thick disk , while the power - law is generally attributed to inverse - compton scattering of softer disk photons off high - energy electrons .",
    "the peak temperature and luminosity of the thermal component are good indicators of the size of the x - ray - emitting inner - disk region , which in turn is related to the bh mass .    in the standard disk - blackbody approximation ( makishima et al . , 1986 , 2000 )",
    ", @xmath10 where : @xmath11 is the integrated ( bolometric ) disk luminosity ; @xmath12 is the peak colour temperature , which can be directly inferred from x - ray spectral fitting ; @xmath13 is the peak effective temperature ; @xmath14 is the hardening factor ( @xmath15 ) ; @xmath16 is the true inner - disk radius , assumed to coincide with the innermost stable circular orbit @xmath2 ; @xmath17 is the apparent inner radius obtained from spectral fitting with the disk - blackbody approximation ; @xmath18 depends on the spin of the bh ( @xmath19 for a schwarzschild bh , @xmath20 for an extreme kerr bh ) .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath21 was introduced ( kubota et al . , 1998 ) to obtain a correctly normalized bolometric disk luminosity , taking into account that the fitted peak temperature occurs at @xmath22 because of the no - torque boundary conditions . with this approximation , and with the choice of @xmath23 ( shimura & takahara , 1995 )",
    ", the physical inner - disk radius is related to the fitted value by : @xmath24 an alternative estimate of @xmath25 , which takes into account relativistic corrections , suggests that @xmath26 ( fabian et al . ,  2004 ) , which is equivalent to a choice of @xmath27 for the hardening factor in ( 3 ) .",
    "a hardening factor as high as @xmath28 was empirically estimated for some galactic bhs in the high / soft state ( shrader & titarchuk , 2003 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity can be derived from the observed flux : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the source distance and @xmath31 the viewing angle ( the disk flux being higher in the direction perpendicular to the disk plane ) .",
    "in addition , the disk luminosity can be directly related to the accretion rate , from general energy - conservation priciples .",
    "ignoring relativistic corrections , @xmath32    from ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 6 ) we have : @xmath33 which can also be expressed as @xmath34 .",
    "this is the fundamental evolutionary track of an accretion disk in the thermal - dominant state .",
    "as their accretion rate varies , individual sources are expected to move along tracks of constant @xmath35 and @xmath16 .",
    "this has been observationally verified for galactic bhs ( e.g. , kubota & makishima , 2004 ; miller et al . ,  2004 ) , at least until their disk luminosity approaches the classical eddington limit , @xmath36 erg s@xmath37 . despite the various approximations , ( 7 ) works well ( within a factor of @xmath38 ) when applied to the masses of galactic bhs , assuming radiative efficiencies @xmath39 .",
    "theoretical and observational arguments suggest that stellar - mass bhs are typically found in a thermal - dominant state when their luminosity and corresponding accretion rate are @xmath40@xmath41 times the classical spherical eddington limit .",
    "ulx x - ray spectra can also be modelled with a power - law plus a thermal component , much cooler than that observed from galactic bhs  typically , with colour temperatures @xmath42@xmath43 kev for the brightest sources ( miller et al . ,  2004 ; feng & kaaret , 2005 ; stobbart et al . ,  2006 ) . if ( 7 ) is applied , with total @xmath8@xmath9 kev luminosities",
    "@xmath44@xmath45 erg s@xmath37 , the inferred masses are @xmath46@xmath47 , or a factor of two lower if we consider only the luminosity in the thermal component .",
    "this argument has been used in support of the intermediate - mass bh interpretation of ulxs ( miller et al . ,  2004 ) .    however , it is unclear whether this argument can be directly applied to ulxs .",
    "there is still little direct evidence that the `` soft excess '' in ulxs is due to disk emission , partly because of our limited observing band .",
    "various alternative interpretations have been suggested ( e.g. , gonalves & soria , 2006 ; stobbart et al .",
    ",  2006 ; ebisawa et al . ,",
    "for example , analogous soft - excesses in agn , and particularly in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , can be explained as blurred , ionized absorption ( mostly in the @xmath48@xmath38 kev band ) and reprocessing of the primary power - law - like spectrum in a fast outflow ( gierliski & done , 2004 ; chevallier et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "gonalves & soria ( 2006 ) showed that a similar interpretation can be applied to at least some ulxs , whose x - ray spectra are very similar to those of narrow - line seyferts .",
    "downscattering of harder photons by a cooler outflow is another mechanism proposed to explain the soft excess ( king & pounds , 2003 ; laming & titarchuk , 2004 ) .",
    "even if we accept that the soft excess is indeed thermal emission from a disk ( as we shall do in the rest of this paper ) , we need to keep in mind that some of the disk - blackbody scaling relations summarized in section 1 have been confirmed observationally for the thermal dominant state ( remillard & mcclintock , 2006 ) , but have to be modified when a consistent fraction of the accretion power is not directly radiated by the disk ( section 3 ) .",
    "two key issues need to be addressed by any ulx spectral model .",
    "the first is that the x - ray spectra of most ulxs are dominated by a broad , power - law - like component , at least in the limited energy range covered by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. the thermal component represents only @xmath49@xmath50 per cent of the @xmath8@xmath9 kev emission ( stobbart et al .",
    ",  2006 ; feng & kaaret , 2005 ; winter et al . ,",
    "physically , this suggests that most of the accretion power is not directly radiated by the disk , but is efficiently transferred in other forms ( mechanical , thermal or magnetic energy ) to an upscattering medium , and then partly radiated with a non - thermal ( power - law - like ) spectrum . in galactic stellar - mass bhs , this happens more commonly when the system is in the low / hard state , accreting at less than a few percent of their eddington rate .",
    "but for transient sources , it also happens briefly near the peak of their outbursts , when they are probably accreting above their eddington rate ( very high state ) .",
    "the second issue to be addressed is why the disk appears so cold for its luminosity .",
    "even when we take into account only the luminosity in the fitted thermal component , ulx disks can radiate up to @xmath51 erg s@xmath37 with a much lower peak temperature than that observed from galactic bhs in their high state , even though the latter are an order of magnitude less luminous .",
    "a standard , truncated disk , replaced in the inner region by a radiatively - inefficient flow ( narayan & yi 1994 ) , would produce a power - law - dominated spectrum with a cold disk component ( low / hard state ) .",
    "however , if ulxs are in the low / hard state at luminosities @xmath51 erg s@xmath37 ( and hence , at mass accretion rates @xmath52 yr@xmath37 ) , their bh masses should be @xmath53 .",
    "the formation of such massive remnants in the local universe is difficult to explain with existing models of stellar or star cluster evolution , and the existence of primordial intermediate - mass bhs is not yet supported by independent evidence .",
    "therefore , we need to consider alternative scenarios , in which the accretion rate is high , but the disk is or appears cooler than a standard disk in a thermal dominant state , for the same accretion rate and bh mass .    in the rest of this paper , we will discuss phenomenological corrections to the disk - blackbody equations , to estimate what physical effects may produce more luminous but cooler disks .",
    "we will also illustrate the effects that those corrections have on the bh mass estimates .",
    "the first plausible scenario we consider is that a constant fraction of power @xmath54 is extracted from the disk at each radius ( independent of radius ) ; for example , to power a corona .",
    "the radiative flux from the disk becomes @xmath55 as a result , the peak temperature @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "neither @xmath16 nor @xmath17 changes .",
    "the emitted spectrum is still a disk blackbody .",
    "as @xmath58 increases , the disk becomes cooler and less luminous , for a fixed accretion rate , and its parameters move downwards along the same @xmath34 track .",
    "this scenario is equivalent to changing the effective accretion rate @xmath59 .",
    "it follows from the previous argument that the bh mass is still given by ( 7 ) , independent of @xmath58 .",
    "hence , removal of a constant fraction of accretion power does make the disk cooler but does not explain the high bh masses inferred from ulx spectral fitting .",
    "another simple modification to the standard - disk scenario is to assume that an increasing fraction of the emitted disk photons are upscattered by relativistic electrons at the disk photosphere .",
    "this is equivalent to increasing the hardening factor @xmath14 , typically from @xmath60 to @xmath61 ( davis et al . , 2005 ; 2006 ) .",
    "observationally , this spectral hardening occurs at accretion rates near or just above eddington .    in the @xmath62 plane ,",
    "the effect is to move the source horizontally to the right : higher colour temperature @xmath12 but same effective temperature @xmath13 and same luminosity @xmath11",
    ". the true inner - disk radius @xmath16 does not change , while the apparent disk radius decreases : @xmath63^{2 } r_{\\rm in}$ ] .",
    "this does not affect the mass estimate , if one has properly taken into account its dependence on @xmath13 , as we did in ( 7 ) .",
    "the third effect that needs to be taken into account is a partial covering of the disk surface : a fraction @xmath64 of photons may be absorbed or more generally removed from the disk - blackbody spectrum by clouds or a moderately optically - thick corona .",
    "they are re - emitted in other spectral bands or components ( e.g. , x - ray power - law , or infrared ) . in a self - consistent analysis ,",
    "one must of course account for all upscattering , downscattering and absorption effects , redistributing the total available accretion power into the various components .",
    "but for the purpose of relating the _ disk _ emission parameters to the bh mass , we can simply consider those photons as being lost from the disk spectrum .",
    "the effect is to reduce the observed disk flux and consequently the inferred luminosity : @xmath65 .",
    "the spectral shape is not altered .",
    "the peak colour temperature @xmath12 is not changed .",
    "@xmath16 stays the same but the apparent disk radius decreases : @xmath66 , because @xmath17 is indirectly derived from the flux normalization .",
    "the bh mass inferred from the observed luminosity and temperature via ( 7 ) is a factor @xmath67 less than the true mass .    the combined effect of the modifications described in sections 3.1 , 3.2 and 3.3 is to move the location of the source _ to the right - hand - side of its thermal track _ , in the @xmath62 plane ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the precise displacement depends on the relative importance of the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath64 .",
    "physically , it leads to lower estimates for the radius @xmath17 ( sometimes much lower than the innermost stable orbit ) , and may lead to an underestimate of the bh mass if not properly accounted for . these empirical corrections may be used to explain the _ very high state ( or steep - power - law state ) _ of accreting black holes ( remillard & mcclintock , 2006 ) .",
    "they do not help explain the high masses and large radii inferred for ulxs .",
    "for high accretion rates , it is plausible to speculate that accretion power may not be uniformely removed from the whole disk ( section 3.1 ) and/or disk photons may not be uniformly `` lost '' independent of radius .",
    "more likely , those losses may be strongly concentrated in the inner disk region ( done & kubota , 2006 ; soria & kuncic , 2007b ) .",
    "for example , the inner disk may be disrupted or simply occulted by an optically - thick outflow ( king & pounds , 2003 ) . or",
    ", all of its photons may be comptonized by an optically - thick corona and emerge as a power - law or broken power - law component ( stobbart et al .",
    ",  2006 ) . alternatively , the inner disk may still be present and visible , but most of its accretion power is extracted via non - radiative processes , such as mechanical outflows or poynting flux ( kuncic & bicknell , 2004 ) .",
    "some of the power released through those channels is then converted to non - thermal photons .",
    "hence , a possible phenomenological way to correct the standard disk equations is to assume the presence of a transition radius @xmath69 . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the inflow can be approximated by a standard disk , such that @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the maximum ( observable ) disk temperature . for @xmath3",
    ", we assume that all the accretion power comes out in the power - law - like component , and the standard disk either is not directly visible or gives a negligible direct contribution .",
    "regardless of the details , in this scenario , ( 2 ) no longer holds or is no longer relevant to the observed spectrum .",
    "it is replaced by @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "the visible disk radiates only the accretion power released from the outer radius to @xmath75 .",
    "the effective radiative efficiency of that part of the inflow @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we have ( cf .",
    "( 6),(7 ) ) : @xmath77 where @xmath78 erg s@xmath37 and @xmath79 kev are typical values found in ulxs .",
    "we speculate that the high masses inferred for some of those systems are not evidence of intermediate - mass bhs , but are simply a consequence of a high value @xmath80 not properly taken into account in the disk modelling . defining a dimensionless accretion rate @xmath81 the bolometric disk luminosity integrated for @xmath82",
    "can more usefully be expressed as @xmath83",
    "it was suggested that the disk structure parameterized in section 4 is applicable to sources with very high accretion rates , @xmath84 ( done & kubota , 2006 ; soria , 2007 ; soria & kuncic , 2007b ) . to estimate the bh mass and accretion rate of a source in that state , from the observed disk luminosity and temperature , we need to estimate @xmath85 , either by measuring it directly , or by understanding how it depends on @xmath1 .",
    "the simplest way to estimate @xmath86 , at least as an order of magnitude , is to recall that in this scenario , all of the accretion power released at @xmath70 is radiated by the disk , and some or most of the power released at @xmath3 is eventually radiated as power - law photons , without contributing to the thermal disk component . since the accretion power liberated down to a radius @xmath87 scales @xmath88 , one can estimate that @xmath89 .",
    "the inequality sign takes into account the fact that the radiative efficiency of the non - thermal processes in the inner region is less than the efficiency of blackbody emission in a standard disk . for the most luminous nearby ulxs , extrapolating from the relative fluxes of the power - law and thermal components in the @xmath8@xmath9 kev band , the luminosity ratio @xmath90@xmath7",
    "; in a few other , more distant ulxs , there is only a lower limit @xmath91 for this ratio .",
    "hence , we infer that @xmath80 for typical ulxs .    from the fitted luminosity and temperature of the disk ( 9 ) , typical values of @xmath92 km are found for many ulxs , i.e. , @xmath93 times larger than typical inner - disk radii in stellar - mass bh .",
    "if @xmath80 , it means that bh masses in those ulxs are only required to be @xmath94 times larger than typical bh masses in galactic systems .",
    "this simple argument suggests that ulx masses are @xmath95 .",
    "the location or evolutionary track of a source in the @xmath96 plane provides another observational constraint . to predict the displacement of a source from its thermal track when @xmath97 , we need to understand how @xmath86 and @xmath98 vary as a function of @xmath1 . for a fixed bh mass ,",
    "the radiative flux equation of a standard disk tells us that @xmath99 .",
    "it was suggested ( poutanen et al .",
    ",  2007 ; begelman et al . ,  2007 ; soria & kuncic , 2007b ) that @xmath100 , based on plausible physical processes that may form such a transition radius .",
    "if so , from ( 9 ) we expect that , as the accretion rate @xmath1 increases , a source will move along a track defined by @xmath101 constant , @xmath102 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the luminosity track is very sensitive to the radial temperature distribution on the disk , at @xmath82 .",
    "disk models with a distribution flatter than @xmath103 are sometimes used .",
    "for example , it was found ( kubota et al . ,  2005 ) that @xmath104 may provide a more accurate fit to the x - ray spectral data of galactic bhs . in that case",
    ", we expect @xmath105 , with @xmath106 . for a disk dominated by x - ray irradiation (",
    "as may be the case if @xmath107 ) , @xmath108 . in that case , @xmath109 , with @xmath110 .",
    "see soria & kuncic ( 2007b ) for further discussions and a comparison with observations .",
    "regardless of the precise functional forms of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the significant result is that we expect a source to move _ to the left - hand - side of its thermal track _ , as the accretion rate increases ( soria 2007 ) . along that track",
    ", the luminosity of the disk component stays constant or increases , even if the observed peak temperature decreases .",
    "we speculate that the effects described in sections 3.1 , 3.2 and 3.3 dominate when @xmath113 , and the shift to larger transition radii and lower peak temperatures becomes the dominant term for @xmath114 .",
    "thus , we predict that an accreting bh may initially move up along its thermal track , then slightly down and to the right , then cross the thermal track and move to the left , for increasing accretion rates ( figure 2 ) .",
    "as it does so , we also expect the source to become more and more dominated by non - thermal emission components ( including compton scattering ) .",
    "we also suggest that transient stellar - mass bhs are more likely to proceed in the opposite direction : moving from the low hard state directly to the ultraluminous state on the left - hand - side of the diagram , at the beginning of the outburst , when the accretion rate is highest ; then they may move to the right , spend some time in the very high state and high / soft state as the accretion rate declines , and finally return to the low / hard state .",
    "the fitted x - ray properties of many bright ulxs are qualitatively consistent with this phenomenological scenario .",
    "their disks are very luminous but have a low peak temperature .",
    "the total power output is dominated by a power - law component , perhaps in addition to other non - thermal and non - radiative mechanisms ( e.g. , outflows ) .",
    "their characteristic variability timescales are consistent with large disk radii ( soria & kuncic , 2007b ) . for example",
    ", let us consider an accreting bh with @xmath115 , and a disk luminosity @xmath116 erg s@xmath37 @xmath117 . if @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we expect its spectrum to be dominated by the disk component , with a peak temperature @xmath120 kev and a characteristic size of the x - ray emitting region @xmath121 km .",
    "although the luminosity is consistent with an average ulx , its spectral properties are not .",
    "however , let us allow for @xmath122 , and consequently @xmath123 . in that case , we expect that the source will still have @xmath124 erg s@xmath37 , but a peak temperature @xmath125 kev @xmath126 kev , a characteristic radius @xmath127 km , and a dominant x - ray power - law component with a luminosity @xmath128 erg s@xmath37 .",
    "these are more typical ulx parameters .",
    "if we had observed such a source , determining only its fitted values of @xmath11 and @xmath98 , and inserting those values directly into ( 7 ) instead ( 9 ) , we would have incorrectly interpreted the source as an intermediate - mass bh with @xmath129 .",
    "it is now recognized that it may not be possible to estimate bh masses in ulxs using the standard disk - blackbody model .",
    "if we accept that the soft excess is the disk emission component ( which at this stage is only one possible hypothesis ) , we need to account for the fact that ulx spectra are power - law dominated and their thermal component has a remarkably low peak temperature .",
    "we briefly reviewed simple phenomenological corrections to the standard disk model , which have been used to explain the very high state of galactic bhs .",
    "however , they do not help explaining the ulx spectral properties .",
    "we then discussed the effects of introducing a transition radius @xmath130 , such that for @xmath131 the accretion flow is a standard disk , while for @xmath132 the disk is either drained of all its power via non - thermal processes , or its photons are completely reprocessed by an optically - thick comptonizing medium . in this case , the peak disk emission comes from @xmath133 , while the inner part of the inflow emits with a power - law - like spectrum .",
    "we speculate that @xmath134 , where @xmath1 is the accretion rate in eddington units . with this parameterization , for a fixed bh mass , the peak colour temperature @xmath135 with @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , with @xmath138 .",
    "the predicted effect is to move the source to the left - hand - side of its thermal track in the @xmath96 plane .",
    "this behaviour may be incorrectly read as standard disk emission from a more massive bh .",
    "we argue that this had lead to the flawed intermediate - mass bh interpretation . in our scenario , if the accretion rate @xmath139 , the bh mass can be @xmath4@xmath5 ; hence , perhaps still consistent with their formation via stellar processes , in very special circumstances . on the other hand",
    ", the bh mass may not be much smaller than @xmath140 , if we assume that @xmath141 and @xmath142 a few @xmath143 . in this scenario ,",
    "the peak flux contribution from the disk may come from @xmath93 gravitational radii .",
    "the dependence of the transition radius on the accretion rate needs to be taken into account also when scaling the frequency of x - ray quasi - periodic oscillations between sources of different mass .",
    "lower frequencies may be caused by either an increase of @xmath1 or an increase of @xmath35 .    in summary",
    ", we speculate that ulxs may be defined as accreting bhs with masses a few times higher than galactic bhs , and persistent accretion rates at least an order of magnitude above their eddington limit . none of them has been seen to move along its thermal track , typical of accretion rates @xmath40@xmath41 eddington .",
    "perhaps this is due to the nature of their massive roche - lobe - filling donor stars , which provide a consistently higher mass transfer rate .",
    "a physical interpretation of the transition radius , as well as a more detailed comparison with observed x - ray spectral and timing properties of some galactic bhs and ulxs will be presented elsewhere ( soria & kuncic , 2007b ) .",
