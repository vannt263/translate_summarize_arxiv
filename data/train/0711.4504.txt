    "one of the outstanding problems in molecular processes in living systems has been how they achieve reliable action under the influence of overwhelming thermal and/or statistical fluctuations . in the case of muscle contraction ,",
    "huxley@xcite has already noticed , in his original work , that collective action of many motors produces smooth sliding motion even though action of individual motor is highly stochastic .",
    "recently , imafuku and co - workers have done series of experiments on filament motion driven by many molecular motors ; focusing on the _ fluctuation _ rather than the average motion , they have revealed an intriguing aspect of co - operativity in the collective action@xcite .",
    "they performed the _ in vitro _",
    "motility assay on an unloaded filament of length @xmath2 , measured the displacement @xmath3 over the time interval between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and evaluated the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 in the sliding motion defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the average over initial time @xmath4 and samples .",
    "if each motor exerting the force to the filament is statistically independent , the fluctuation is averaged out as the filament length @xmath2 becomes longer , namely , as the number of motors that interact with the filament becomes larger .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath6 decreases in proportion to @xmath9 for random action of independent motors@xcite . in the experiments , however , they have found that @xmath6 is not proportional to @xmath9 but converges to a constant value for large @xmath2 .",
    "this means that the motors are not interacting with the filament independently but their actions are correlated with each other .    in order to understand these results , sekimoto and tawada have analyzed the motion of a cytoskeletal filament driven by protein motors with random orientation , and demonstrated that the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 of its motion is independent of the filament length due to the randomness quenched in the motor orientation@xcite .",
    "later , however , noda _ et al _ have found similar behavior of @xmath6 even for the case where sekimoto and tawada model is not applicable , i.e. the case where the myosins are not random but aligned@xcite .",
    "no other model has been known to show the constant @xmath6 so far , and origin of the observed fluctuations has not been understood yet .    in this paper",
    ", we study fluctuations of cytoskeletal filament motion in detail for three existing models : sekimoto and tawada model@xcite , prost model@xcite , and duke model@xcite ; these are known to produce some kind of co - operativity@xcite . as a tool to analyze dynamics ,",
    "we examine _ the velocity - correlation function _ of the filament sliding motion obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "nature of dynamics shows up in detailed feature of the velocity correlation function , and the diffusion coefficient can be derived from its integration .    in sec.2 ,",
    "some of the basic formulas are introduced in connection with the diffusion coefficient and the velocity correlation .",
    "detailed description and results for each model are presented with discussions for sekimoto - tawada model in sec.3 , for prost model in sec.4 , and for duke model in sec.5 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec.6 .",
    "imafuku _ et al._@xcite measured the variance of positional fluctuation of the filament defined as @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the displacement over the time interval of length @xmath11 .",
    "the average displacement @xmath12 is linear in time , and the mean velocity @xmath13 of the filament is determined by @xmath14    they found that @xmath15 increases linearly in time .",
    "this is an ordinary diffusion process , and is characterized by the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 defined by @xmath16 in the actual experiments , it has been found that @xmath17 behaves as @xmath18 with a constant @xmath19 , which mainly comes from the finite spatial resolution in experiments@xcite .",
    "the diffusion around the average motion comes from the velocity fluctuations in the sliding motion , and @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath20 in terms of the velocity correlation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the velocity at time @xmath11 and @xmath13 is the average velocity .",
    "the derivation of eq.([eq : fr2cv ] ) is given in appendix .",
    "note that the relation ( [ eq : fr2cv ] ) is modified when the data is only available at discrete times by the step @xmath23 as in the experiments or our monte carlo ( mc ) simulations : in this case , defining of velocity at time @xmath24 as @xmath25/\\tau$ ] , the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 is given by @xmath26\\tau , \\label{eq : discretedm}\\ ] ] in the long - time limit(see appendix ) .",
    "the velocity correlation function @xmath27 goes to zero when @xmath11 becomes large enough compared to any relevant correlation time , therefore , the second term contribution in eq.([eq : fr2cv ] ) becomes negligible in the large @xmath28 limit , consequently , @xmath17 increases linearly in time and @xmath6 in eq.([dmdef ] ) can be expressed by @xmath29 namely , the diffusion coefficient is given by the integral of the velocity correlation function .",
    "actual measurements are always based on finite time observations , thus we define the finite time diffusion coefficient @xmath30 as the slope of @xmath15 at @xmath11 , then we can show @xmath31 namely , only the correlation shorter than @xmath11 contributes to @xmath30 .",
    "experimentally determined diffusion coefficient based on the measurement of variance for the time interval @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath30 .",
    "this should give a good approximation for the diffusion coefficient ( [ eq : dminteg ] ) , if @xmath11 is large enough compared to the correlation times .",
    "we should be careful about the effect of the measurement time @xmath32 when we interpret the results , because we do not know the length of correlation time for the system in advance .",
    "imafuku and coworkers estimated the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 from experimental data by the slope of @xmath17 at around @xmath33 for microtubules driven by kinesin@xcite @xmath34 for microtubules driven by dynein@xcite , and @xmath35 for actin filaments driven by myosin@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we analyze the diffusion constant @xmath6 along with the velocity correlation .",
    "sekimoto and tawada have proposed a simple model to explain dynamical fluctuations in the motion of a cytoskeletal filament driven by protein motors fixed on a substrate surface@xcite ; the motor proteins are assumed to be aligned at regular intervals @xmath36 but in random orientation , and a filament of the length @xmath2 slides over the motors in one direction in the presence of atp .",
    "the sliding motion is generated by the motors , which are assumed to attach to the filament with the rate constant @xmath37 , make a conformational change or `` power stroke '' to generate force , and detach from the filament with the rate constant @xmath38 .",
    "the motors interact with the filament independently . if the linear force law between the filament and the motors is employed , the sliding distance generated by a power stroke of the width @xmath39 by the @xmath40th motor would be @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of the motors that attach to the filament at the time of the stroke . the factor @xmath43 comes from the fact that the motors bound to the filament at the time resist the sliding motion .",
    "the value of stroke width @xmath39 for the @xmath40th motor is always the same , but different at random from that of other motors because of its random orientation .",
    "sekimoto and tawada have demonstrated that the model shows @xmath2 independent diffusion constant .",
    "we simulate sekimoto - tawada model by the following mc procedure with the time @xmath23 for one mc step : ( a ) pick a motor , say @xmath40 , at random out of the motors under the filament .",
    "( b ) if the @xmath40th motor is not attached to the filament , attach it with the probability @xmath44 , and advance the filament by @xmath45 .",
    "if the @xmath40th motor is already attached to the filament , detach it with the probability @xmath46 without any motion of the filament .",
    "one mc step of @xmath23 corresponds to repeating this procedure @xmath47 times , where @xmath47 is the number of motors that are capable of attaching to the filament : @xmath48 .",

    "figure [ fig2](b ) shows the velocity correlation @xmath27 for rather long time ( @xmath66 ) , and the inset shows the short time behaviors for @xmath67 s. we find following characteristic behavior in @xmath27 : ( i ) at @xmath68 , the velocity correlation @xmath69 is the variance of the velocity fluctuation , which takes a certain positive value .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath70 , @xmath27 drops immediately to almost zero , but recovers quickly to reach the maximum . (",

    "( iv ) the value of @xmath27 scales as to @xmath9 for both @xmath68 and the maximum value described at ( ii ) .",
    "note that the actual values of instantaneous velocity variance @xmath69 do not have physical meaning because the model assumes instantaneous displacement by a stroke of molecular motor .",
    "the immediate drop of @xmath27 comes from the fact that the consecutive strokes to the filament is random .",
    "the short time recovery is due to the correlation given by the strokes from the same motors .",
    "the time @xmath71 when the maximum correlation is achieved corresponds to the time interval that each motor gives successive strokes to the filament , namely @xmath72 .",
    "this time does not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "the gradual linear decay after that comes from the loss of correlation due to the fact that new motors come into play as the filament moves .",
    "the correlation is lost completely when the filament proceeds over the distance @xmath2 and resides on a new set of motors , therefore , the time scale for this correlation is @xmath63 .    the variance of displacement @xmath17 is shown in fig.[fig2](c ) by a solid line for @xmath613 , 6 , and 12@xmath73 m .",
    "we see that the slope increases gradually in course of time till @xmath74 .",
    "this comes from the slow decay of the velocity correlation @xmath27 in fig.[fig2](b ) through eq.([eq : fr2cv ] ) , namely , the slope at time @xmath11 is given by the integration of @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the slope of the variance is proportional to @xmath9 for a fixed short time @xmath77 , because @xmath78 for a fixed time @xmath79 .",
    "the slope for long time @xmath80 , however , becomes independent of @xmath2 , because the range that @xmath27 is non - zero is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "fig.[fig2](d ) shows the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 obtained from the slope for long time ( fitted in the range @xmath81 ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath6 tends to a non - zero constant for larger @xmath2 .",
    "as denoted above , however , @xmath6 should be proportional to @xmath9 if one measures at fixed @xmath77 in this model .",
    "the key of this model is that each motor gives strokes of its inherent strength , simulating the experimental situation where motors are fixed to a substrate surface in random orientation and are not aligned to the direction of the filament ; each motor always gives the same stroke , although it varies from motor to motor .",
    "this makes the correlation time in velocity fluctuation proportional to @xmath2 , and results in the @xmath2 independent diffusion constant .",
    "if a stroke @xmath39 by a motor changes randomly every time it gives a stroke , the correlation time is independent of @xmath2 , thus the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 would be proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "this assumption of quenched randomness in stroke in the sekimoto - tawada model is introduced in order to simulate the experimental situations by imafuku _",
    "et al._@xcite , where microtubules are driven by motors scattered randomly on a substrate .",
    "their results that the diffusion coefficient in sliding motion of microtubules is independent of @xmath2 are reproduced by the model .",
    "the present analysis shows , however , that this does not necessarily justify the model because the experimental time scales are not in the range where the model gives @xmath2 independent diffusion coefficient . in these experiments ,",
    "@xmath63 was @xmath82 to @xmath83 in ref.@xcite and @xmath84 to @xmath85 in ref.@xcite , while the time @xmath11 of the measurement was about @xmath83 in ref.@xcite and @xmath82 in ref.@xcite , respectively .",
    "namely , the latter experiment by imafuku _",
    "et al._@xcite were in the range @xmath86 , i.e. , the range where sekimoto - tawada model shows the diffusion coefficient that decreases with @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the results of the model does not correspond to the experimental observation by imafuku _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "relevance of quenched randomness to the anomalous diffusion is also questionable ; kinesin has been demonstrated to swivel almost freely to adjust itself in any direction to give effective strokes@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the anomalous filament length independent diffusion has been observed even in the experiment where myosins are aligned in orientation@xcite .",
    "prost and coworkers introduced a two - state model of brownian motor , which exhibits cooperative behavior@xcite . in their model",
    ", motors are attached to a backbone with a fixed spacing @xmath36 , and each motor can take two states : the bound state and the unbound state . in the bound state , the motor",
    "is strongly bound to a filament to exert the sliding force on it , and the interaction potential between the filament and the motor is periodic with period @xmath87 along the cytoskeletal filament .",
    "a simple saw teeth potential is assumed ; each tooth of the potential height @xmath88 consists of a part with a positive slope of length @xmath89 and a part with a negative slope of length @xmath90 .",
    "the unbound state represents the weakly bound state , where the interaction potential is flat , and the motor does not exert force on the filament .",
    "the transition from the bound to the unbound state takes place with the rate @xmath91 only when a motor is around the potential minima within a detaching region of size @xmath92 .",
    "the transition from the unbound to the bound state , on the other hand , occurs everywhere with a constant rate @xmath93 .",
    "the inertia of the filament is assumed to be negligible , thus the instantaneous velocity of the filament @xmath94 is determined by the balance between the total potential force from the motors @xmath95 and viscous force @xmath96 , where @xmath47 is the number of motors and @xmath97 is the viscous resistance coefficient per motor .",
    "this model has been demonstrated to show a collective motion of smooth sliding when a number of motors are attached to a filament@xcite , in contrast with a brownian motion under a periodic potential for a single motor system .",
    "if the periodic potential is asymmetric , the filament shows unidirectional motion , while bidirectional motion is observed when the potential is symmetric .",
    "the cooperativity of the motors is evident especially in the symmetric case . in this case , there is no reason for the filament to proceed in one direction , but once the filament starts moving to one of the directions by chance , it tends to keep on moving in the same direction .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the transition from the bound to the unbound state occurs only when the motors are around the potential minima ; the motors are kicked out to the unbound state after they go down the potential slope exerting the force to the filament , therefore , there are more motors going down the potential than those going up in the bound state .",
    "this state of directed motion may be regarded as a state with a broken symmetry due to the collective effect@xcite .",
    "the direction of motion flips occasionally when the filament length is finite , and the interval between the flips gets exponentially long with the filament length . a theory analogous to the one for the phase transition in a magnetic system has been developed to describe this state .",
    "one monte carlo step with the time @xmath23 consists of the two procedures : ( a ) the transition trials between the bound and the unbound states of motors , and ( b ) the filament advance . in the procedure ( a ) , each of the @xmath47 motors goes through the following transition trial depending upon its state : if the motor is in the bound state and it is located in one of the detaching regions of size @xmath92 around the potential minima , detach it to the unbound state with the probability @xmath98 .",

    "otherwise , do nothing .",

    "we examine the behavior near the stalling load because cooperative operation of motors has been observed under load@xcite , which could result in fluctuations peculiar to the model . for each case",
    ", we present trajectories , velocity correlations , time developments of displacement variance , and the filament length dependences of diffusion constant .",
    "figures [ fig3](a1 ) and ( b1 ) show trajectories for filaments with @xmath613 , 6 , and 12@xmath113 .",
    "the average velocity @xmath13 is almost independent of @xmath2 : @xmath1112.06 , 2.11 , and 2.14 @xmath112 without load , and @xmath1111.98 , 2.25 , and 2.36 @xmath169 with load .",
    "the insets show detailed structure of trajectories .",
    "one can see larger fluctuations in shorter filaments . for the cases under the load ,",
    "there appear back and forth movements(the inset of fig.[fig3](b1 ) ) ; displacement of the movement is of the order of a stroke size @xmath127 , and its time scale is determined by the reaction rates .",
    "this is a result of cooperative action of motors ; with more motors attached , they produce force collectively to move forward , but detachment of some motors causes backlash , which leads to further detachment .",
    "the velocity correlations are shown in figs.[fig3](a2 ) and ( b2 ) .",
    "for both of the cases , immediately after large positive instantaneous correlation , the correlation is negative for short time and becomes positive around @xmath172 s. the initial negative correlation is due to the backlash caused by detachment after a stroke .",
    "the time scale for correlation is determined by the reaction rates and does not depend on the filament length .",
    "note that the actual value of instantaneous correlation is not meaningful in this model as in sekimoto - tawada model , because filament position is shifted instantaneously during the process of equilibration .",
    "difference between the two cases is in the amplitude of the correlation .",
    "first , the amplitude is much larger for the cases with load than those without load .",
    "the large correlation in the case under load comes from the back and forth movement .",
    "secondly , regarding the @xmath2 dependence , the amplitude is larger for shorter filament for the loadless case as in the previous model , while it is smaller for shorter filament for the case with load .",
    "the larger correlation for shorter filament in the loadless case corresponds to the fact that the fluctuations in trajectories are larger for shorter filaments as has been seen in fig.[fig3](a1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger correlation for longer filament in the case with load corresponds to the fact that the short time back - and - forth movement is more regular in longer filament(the inset of fig.[fig3](b1 ) ) .",
    "the fluctuation in the time scale longer than 1 second seems to be larger in shorter filament for the case with load , but the correlation in such long time scale can not be seen in fig.[fig3](b2 ) because of statistical errors .",
    "the time dependences of displacement variance are shown in figs.[fig3](a3 ) and ( b3 ) , and the diffusion constant estimated from these are presented in figs.[fig3](a4 ) and ( b4 ) with the @xmath9 curves fitted to the data . for both cases ,",
    "the diffusion constant is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "this is natural for the case without load , because the time scales of @xmath27 are independent of @xmath2 while the value of @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath9 . in the case with load",
    ", the large value of the correlation does not give a large value of @xmath6 ; this means that the back and forth movement in short time scale does not give net motion , and the diffusion comes from the fluctuation in longer time scale , where the fluctuation is larger for shorter filament even in the case with load .",
    "the diffusion constant decreases as @xmath9 with the filament length @xmath2 . in the case without load ,",
    "the situation is simple ; the time scale of velocity correlation is independent of @xmath2 and its value is proportional to @xmath9 , which gives @xmath173 .    in the case with load , the motors on a filament operate collectively , which results in back and forth movement in short time scale .",
    "this back and forth movement becomes more regular and gives larger value of correlation for longer filament , but does not results in larger diffusion .",
    "the diffusion in the sliding motion comes from longer time fluctuations , which is larger for shorter filament .",
    "our results of numerical simulations are summarized as follows : ( i ) although the amplitude of velocity correlation function decreases as @xmath9 , sekimoto - tawada model shows the @xmath2 independent diffusion coefficient @xmath6 because the time scale of velocity correlation is given by @xmath63 , thus proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "( ii ) prost model shows @xmath173 because the amplitude of velocity correlation is proportional to @xmath9 and its time scale is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "( iii ) duke model also shows @xmath173 as in prost model .",
    "although the anomalous diffusion in the experiments is observed without load , we examined duke model with load also , because duke model has been denmonstrated to show a synchronous operation under load and we expected that filament motion caused by collective operation of motors was a possible explanation for large diffusion .",
    "however , the collective movement by synchronous operation under load in duke model did not turn out to produce large diffusion for a long filament ; it gives rather regular back and forth movement in short time , but did not give a net motion for longer time .    in connection with the experimental observation that @xmath6 is finite in the large @xmath2 limit ,",
    "the @xmath2 independent @xmath6 in sekimoto - tawada model is not likely to be relevant ; in the experimentally determination of diffusion coefficient , only the time dependences of the variance shorter than a few seconds are used , which means that the velocity correlation shorter than a few seconds is relevant , while the correlation time in sekimoto - tawada model is of order of @xmath63 , which can be much longer than the experimental time scale for a long filament .    in conclusion , by examining the velocity correlation and the diffusion coefficient ,",
    "we have confirmed the existing models can not account for the anomalous fluctuation that the diffusion coefficient remains finite even in the large @xmath2 region .",
    "our analysis shows that the experimental observations of @xmath2-independent diffusion coefficient require a mechanism that makes both the amplitude and the time scale of velocity correlation function independent of @xmath2 .",
    "we briefly summarize the derivation for some formulas which express the variance @xmath17 in terms of the velocity correlation function @xmath27 following ref.@xcite for both the continuous and discrete time data .",
    "the position of the filament @xmath174 at time @xmath11 is given by @xmath175 and the average position becomes @xmath176 thus , the variance ( [ variance ] ) is given by @xmath177 here , we assumed that the velocity correlation @xmath178 is the function of @xmath11 and does not depend on @xmath4 .    if we take new variables @xmath179 and @xmath180 , the integration ( [ frcv0 ] ) becomes @xmath181^{s'= t } _ { s'=0 } -\\int_{0}^ { t } \\mbox{d}s 's ' c_v(s')\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ &",

    "we define the velocity fluctuation as @xmath184 .",
    "the position at time @xmath185 is given by @xmath186 , and its average is given by @xmath187 .",
    "thus we have @xmath188 now , we assume that @xmath189 depends only on @xmath190 , namely , @xmath191 . then , the first term in ( [ eq : ap2 ] ) becomes @xmath192 while we have @xmath193 for the second term in ( [ eq : ap2 ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : discretedm ] ) .",
    "the present procedure is slightly different from that by duke in his original paper ; duke employed only the redistribution of population in the equilibration process , while we include a filament displacement in equilibration in accordance with the assumption that the time to achieve the force balance is fast in comparison with the mc step ."
