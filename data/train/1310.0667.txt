    ", the instability of the filament may lead to two different types of flares , namely , eruptive or confined flares ( see review by ( * ? ? ?",

    "eruptive flares correspond to cases for which the filament erupts , leading to the formation of a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) . on the other hand , confined flares",
    "are sometimes associated with cases for which the eruption of the filament fails ( _ e.g. _ , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* trk & kliem 2005 ) ) .",
    "confined flares also comprise flares induced by magnetic reconnection of different magnetic flux tubes , or magnetic coronal loops , for which no filament is present ( _ e.g. _ , ( * ? ? ?",

    "the cshkp model predicts for both eruptive and confined flares , that the flare will be associated with two flare ribbons , and with the formation of hot post - flare loops _ below _ the erupting filament , regardless of whether it is a successful or failed eruption .    in this study , we present the evolution of two filaments and a confined flare observed in noaa 11589 , which can not be explained by the cshkp model .",
    "we propose an alternative flare scenario which accounts for the observed flare signatures and filaments evolution during the flare .",
    "our study was performed by combining observations from the solar dynamic observatory ( sdo ) satellite , the french tlescope hliographique pour letude du magntisme et des instabilits solaires ( themis ) , and an indian telescope of the aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences ( aries ) .    noaa 11589 appeared on 2012 october 10 at the heliographic coordinates n13 e61 .",
    "the ar quickly developed into two decaying magnetic polarities ( see fig.[fig - bz - aia171]a ) . during its on - disk passage ,",
    "the ar was associated with large - scale magnetic flux cancellation , and a few localized magnetic flux emergence events .",
    "the flux cancellation in the internal part of the ar led to the formation of two filaments of opposite chirality which eventually converged .",
    "however , the filaments did not merge probably due to their axial field being oriented in opposite direction along the pil ( _ e.g. _ , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schmieder  2004 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* devore  2005 ) ) .",
    "the ar also presented some recurring and localized magnetic flux emergence associated with ellerman bombs ( ebs ) in its northern part ( as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pariat  2004 ) ) .    on october 16 , the ar produced a confined c3.3 class flare which started around 16:00 ut and ended around 16:39 ut . a first analysis of the flare signatures with aia 1600  and aia 171  channels seem to be in agreement with the cshkp model : apparently presenting two flare ribbons , and the formation of hot post - flare loops .",
    "however , a careful analysis of the euv data from the aia 171  channel reveals that the flare did not lead to the eruption of any of the filaments",
    ". it also shows a striking result : the post - flare loops were formed _ above _ the filaments contrary to what is expected from the cshkp model , and the filaments were not disturbed by the flare .",
    "to understand and explain the evolution of the filaments during the flare , we study the magnetic topology of the ar by means of an lfff extrapolation ( @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the force - free parameter ) to identify the key sites for the development of magnetic reconnection that led to the flare .",
    "we only considered the global magnetic field of the ar because ( i ) the filaments were in plage regions where the magnetic field is weak , and thus , the currents are not well measured , and ( ii ) the filaments did not seem to play any role in the flare .",
    "the extrapolations were performed using the fast fourier transform method ( ( * ? ? ? * alissandrakis 1981 ) ) with a non - uniform grid of @xmath3 points covering a domain of @xmath4 . within the set of performed extrapolations",
    ", we kept the solution @xmath5 because it gave the best match with the northern loops of the ar ( fig.[fig - bz - aia171]a ) , _ i.e. _ , the region where the flare was initiated .",

    "e.g. _ , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dmoulin  1996 ) ) .",
    "qsls are thin 3d volumes of very sharp gradients of the magnetic field connectivity .",

    "* dmoulin 2006 ) ) . as separatrices ,",
    "qsls are preferential sites for particle acceleration ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aulanier  2006 ) ) .",
    "many observational studies have thus successfully compared and associated the photospheric footprints of qsls to flare ribbons providing indirect evidence of magnetic reconnection as the triggering mechanism of solar eruptive events ( _ e.g. _ , ( * ? ? ?",

    "* mandrini  1997 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "the photospheric mapping of qsls can be obtained by computing the squashing degree , @xmath6 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* titov  2002 ) ) .",
    "qsls are thus identified as 3d regions of strong @xmath6-values ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we computed the squashing degree for our lfff extrapolation using `` method 3 '' of @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig - qsls - aia1600](a ) displays the photospheric mapping of qsls for the same field of view as fig.[fig - bz - aia171](a ) by representing @xmath8 at the photosphere . by plotting magnetic field lines over the photospheric @xmath6-map , we identified two double - c shape qsls , @xmath9 , similar to @xcite , and a circular - like one ( overlaid with a white circle ) , @xmath10 , similar to @xcite .",
    "we find a few discrepancies between the qsls footprints , @xmath11 , and the three flare ribbons of fig.[fig - qsls - aia1600](b ) , @xmath12 .",
    "this is due to the assumptions made by extrapolating the ar s magnetic field in lfff , which do not model the highly - stressed filament magnetic fields , and which results in local modifications of the magnetic connectivity that slightly modifies the location and shape of the qsls in our extrapolation .",
    "nevertheless , there is a good qualitative agreement between the qsls footprints and the flare ribbons ( fig.[fig - qsls - aia1600 ] ) .     displaying the photospheric footprints of qsls at 15:00 ut .",

    "from the previous analysis , it is clear that the magnetic field of ar 11589 presents a complex topology formed by three entangled qsls .",
    "such a complex topology was favorable to the build - up of electric current layers and to the development of magnetic reconnection at any of these qsls .",
    "the flare might thus have been the result of the stress of , at least , one of the qsls eventually triggering magnetic reconnection at all qsls .",
    "analyzing the aia and hmi data prior to , and after the flare , we found signatures of localized , recurring magnetic flux emergence in the northern part of the ar  in the region below @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ , between the western part of @xmath14 and the southern part of @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , we propose that this episodic flux emergence was the driver of the c3.3 class flare : this continuous magnetic flux emergence may have stressed the magnetic field of @xmath13 , resulting in the formation of a strong thin current layer , at least , within this qsl . eventually , this can trigger slipping or slip - running reconnection at @xmath13 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aulanier  2006 ) ) , which , in turn , can trigger magnetic reconnection at all the other intersecting qsls , @xmath16 and @xmath10 .",
    "this would have induced particle acceleration at all qsls ( _ e.g. _ , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* masson  2009 ) ) , and hence , the formation of a complex distribution of flare ribbons ( such as shown by fig.[fig - qsls - aia1600]b ) .",
    "since both filaments were located below the qsls involved in the flare mechanism , our scenario naturally accounts for the development of post - flare loops _ above _ these non - erupting filaments ."
