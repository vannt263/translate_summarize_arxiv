    "an exact expression for the capacity region does exist , again in terms of @xmath1  @xcite .",

    "the difficulties arising from the structure of @xmath1 are not simply an artifact of the way the capacity region and bounds are written .",
    "in fact it has been shown that the problem of determining the capacity region for multi - source network coding is completely equivalent to characterization of @xmath1 @xcite .    one way to resolve",
    "this difficulty is via relaxation of the bound , replacing the set of entropy functions with the set of polymatroids @xmath3 ( which has a finite characterization ) . in practice",
    "however , the number of variables and constraints increase exponentially with the number of links in the network , and this prevents practical computation for any meaningful case of interest .    in this paper",
