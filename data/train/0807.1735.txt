    "over the past several decades , a large number of investigations of the stars and the globular clusters in the galactic halo have concluded that the halo formed chaotically and over a long period of time through the accretion and disruption of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 , norris 1986 ; carney et al .",
    "1990 ; majewski 1992 ; mackey & gilmore 2004 ; see also freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 for a review ) .",
    "there is evidence , however , that the inner and outer parts of the halo have sufficiently different properties that at least two mechanisms are required to explain the halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "accretion appears to have dominated the formation of the outer halo , but the flattening and prograde rotation of the inner halo and the old ages of the globular clusters in the inner halo suggest that its formation involved the dissipative merging of gas clouds at an early epoch ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "while this dual halo picture is supported by substantial evidence , it continues to be important to see what fraction of the halo can be explained by , for example , an accretion - only scenario .",
    "the most direct evidence for accretion comes from the detection of halo substructures consisting of co - moving streams of stars .",
    "the best documented of these are the streams originating in the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy , which cross much of the sky ( * ? ? ?",

    "* among others ) .",
    "several other substructures have been recently detected in the halo of the milky way ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) and in the halo of m31 @xcite .",
    "these streams provide strong evidence in favor of the hierarchical model of the formation of galaxies , in which large galaxies such as the milky way formed through multiple mergers with smaller building blocks .",
    "simulations of the hierarchical picture predict that the milky way has experienced a large number of minor mergers ( see for example * ? ? ? * ) and show that the ones that occurred during the past few gyrs . may be recognizable today as stellar streams .",
    "while these simulations appear to be consistent with the current observations of the outer halo @xcite , the search for more streams and better documentation of the known ones remains important .",
    "we report here an investigation of the halo substructure in the direction of virgo",
    ". the first sign of an overdensity of halo stars in this direction came from the quest rr lyrae star ( rrls ) survey @xcite , which revealed a small overdensity near 13 hr right ascension ( @xmath4 ) , which was the west boundary of the survey as it existed then .",
    "as the survey was extended , it became clear that this feature is considerably larger and is centered near @xmath5 hr @xcite . in the jargon of the quest survey it became known as the _",
    "`` 12.4 hr clump '' _ ( declination ( @xmath6 ) was not specified because of the narrow range of the survey around @xmath7 ) .",
    "the rrls in the clump cover a range of distances from the sun ( @xmath8 ) with the greatest concentration at @xmath9 kpc @xcite .",
    "using photometry from the sdss , newberg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) independently discovered an overdensity in f type main - sequence stars in approximately the same direction and at a similar distance , which they called s297 + 63 - 20.5 .",
    "they suggested that it may be related to the small group of rrls identified earlier by @xcite , and several authors have subsequently suggested that the 12.4 hr clump of rrls and s297 + 63 - 20.5 are the same substructure or at least related . also using the sdss photometric catalogue , juric et al ( 2005 , 2008 ) later identified a very large overdensity of main sequence stars toward virgo ( the _ virgo overdensity _ ( vod ) ) .",
    "on the sky , the vod encompasses both the 12.4 hr clump and s297 + 63 - 20.5 .",
    "but , according to @xcite , the vod is spread along the line of sight from @xmath10 to @xmath11 kpc , which is a larger range than either the 12.4h clump or s297 + 63 - 20.5 .",
    "the spectroscopy of rrls in the 12.4 hr clump by @xcite provided the first evidence of a moving group in the virgo direction , which they called the _",
    "virgo stellar stream _ ( vss ) .",
    "the recent spectroscopy of f type main - sequence stars in s297 + 63 - 20.5 by @xcite revealed a rich structure in velocity space , but with a major peak that nearly coincides with the velocity of the vss .",
    "they tentatively conclude that s297 + 63 - 20.5 , the vss , and the vod are likely associated , if not the same . on the other hand ,",
    "several authors @xcite have argued that the virgo substructures are parts of sgr streams , while others @xcite have rejected this hypothesis and suggested instead that they are due to a separate merger event involving a dwarf galaxy .",
    "we are carrying out a program to observe spectroscopically a large number of quest rrls in order to measure their radial velocities and metallicities .",
    "rrls are arguably the halo tracer that can be most precisely located in space , and with the addition of radial velocities of even modest precision ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) , they become powerful probes of phase space .",
    "this wonderful property of rrls comes with a price , for they are expensive observationally .",
    "complete light curves are necessary to obtain both mean magnitudes ( hence , precise distances ) and ephemerides .",
    "the later are necessary to isolate the motion of the star in the sky from the pulsational velocity of the star by means of the fitting of a radial velocity curve . in this paper",
    ", we present spectroscopic observations of bright rrls ( @xmath14 , equivalent to d @xmath15 kpc ) in the part of the quest survey that overlaps with the vod . after examining these data for halo substructure",
    ", we discuss the relationships between our results and the previous detections of substructures in virgo and also consider the possibility that they are related to streams from the sgr dsph galaxy .",
    "the rrls surveys by @xcite and by @xcite provide important data on parts of the vod that are not covered by the quest survey .",
    "according to @xcite , the vod occupies @xmath16 sq . degrees of the sky , and its rough limits are shown in figure  [ fig - zone ] .",
    "notice that the sdss does not extend south of @xmath17 at @xmath18 ( see figure 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is possible that the vod extends farther in that direction .",
    "the region surveyed by quest is a @xmath19-wide band centered at @xmath20 .",
    "it passes over part of the vod , as shown in the figure  [ fig - zone ] .",
    "the dot - dashed line in figure  [ fig - zone ] shows the southern limit of a second quest catalog ( vivas et al . in preparation ) which is centered at @xmath21 .",
    "eight stars from this second region are included in our sample .",
    "the region in common between the vod and the quest survey is roughly limited by galactic longitude in the range @xmath22 . at the declination of the quest survey , those limits are equivalent to @xmath23 .",
    "we have therefore selected for spectroscopy all rrls in the quest catalog @xcite within these limits in @xmath4 , and with magnitude @xmath24 .",
    "the constraint in magnitude was imposed by the limitations of our major instrument , the smarts 1.5 m telescope ( see   [ sec - observations ] ) .",
    "the magnitudes of this sample correspond to a range of distance from the sun of @xmath25 to @xmath26 kpc ( using @xmath27 , following vivas & zinn 2006 ) , which partly overlaps the range estimated for the vod ( @xmath28 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig - quest ] shows the extinction corrected magnitude @xmath29 ( equivalent to distance ) of part of the quest rrls in the northern galactic hemisphere , as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the box encloses the sample of 44 stars studied in this work . within the box ,",
    "all the stars in the first quest catalog were observed spectroscopically , but only 8 rrls ( out of 38 ) from the second quest catalog were observed . for reference , we have indicated with solid symbols the location of the rrls that probably belong to the vss @xcite . the stars in our sample are located in the same area of the sky as the vss , but are closer to the sun .",
    "most of them ( the ones with @xmath30 kpc ) are located within the same region of the sky and distance range as the vod .",
    "notice also in figure  [ fig - quest ] that part of the tidal stream of the sgr dsph galaxy lies in the background , at @xmath31 kpc .",
    "we obtained a total of 88 spectra of the 44 rrls with 3 different telescopes between 2001 and 2007 .",
    "the instrumental setups of the different observing runs are summarized in table  [ tab - telescopes ] , and the individual observations are detailed in table  [ tab - observations ] .",
    "most of the spectra were obtained with the smarts 1.5 m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory , chile ( denoted as `` smarts '' in table  [ tab - observations ] ) .",
    "we also used observations obtained with the 1.5 m telescope in la silla , chile ( denoted as `` eso '' ) and with the hydra multifiber spectrograph at wiyn in kitt peak national observatory , usa .",
    "most of the spectra were taken at blue wavelengths , covering the balmer lines ( beginning in h@xmath32 ) and the ca ii h and k lines .",
    "however , we took advantage of available time from other projects at the wiyn telescope and obtained spectra using a setup which covered the red part of the spectra , including the ca triplet lines .",
    "the wiyn observations are denoted in table  [ tab - observations ] as `` wiyn - b '' and `` wiyn - r '' for blue and red spectra respectively .    for each target star , we tried to obtain at least two spectra taken at different phases during the pulsation cycle .",
    "thirty five out of the 44 rrls have two or more spectra available .",
    "table  [ tab - observations ] contains i d ( same quest i d as in vivas et al .",
    "2004 ) , julian date , exposure time , telescope , phase of observation ( see   [ sec - ephemerides ] ) , heliocentric radial velocity with its error ( see   [ sec - rv ] ) , and metallicity ( see   [ sec - feh ] ) .",
    "the 8 stars from the unpublished second part of the quest catalog have i d numbers higher than 700 .",
    "the spectrum of star # 254 indicates that is too cool to be a rr_c _ star .",
    "this is not surprising because a small fraction of the quest rr_c _ stars are expected to be misidentifications of other types of variable stars , mainly variable blue stragglers and w uma eclipsing binaries ( see * ? ? ?",
    "star # 254 was excluded from any further analysis .    to avoid excessive broadening in the spectral features due to the changing velocity of the star during the pulsational cycle ,",
    "exposure times were kept short , usually under 30 minutes .",
    "a few stars have exposure times as long as 60 minutes , which is equivalent to @xmath33 of the pulsation cycle of a typical rrls . in all observing runs",
    ", we observed several stars from the list of @xcite which are both radial velocity and pseudo - equivalent width standards .      since",
    "good ephemerides are essential for fitting the radial velocity curves , it is important to improve them as much as possible .",
    "the quest survey has a large number of epochs ( an average 32 for our targets ) , which should yield precise ephemerides . in @xcite ,",
    "the time of maximum light ( hjd@xmath34 ) for the rr_c _ stars was set by the observation with the brightest magnitude , which is not the best procedure because it can be skewed by photometric error and by poor sampling near maximum light . in addition , for some rr_c _ stars , it was necessary to list two possible periods because both produced reasonable light curve shapes to the eye .    to obtain better light curve parameters ,",
    "we have fitted a light curve template to each rr_c _ star in our sample .",
    "a sine curve produced a poor fit because a typical rr_c _ stars has a phase difference between maximum and minimum light of @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , we constructed a light curve template based on 9 of the best observed quest rr_c _ stars , which did not suffer from period aliases or from a poorly measured hjd@xmath34 .",
    "this template was then fitted using @xmath36 minimization , while varying the amplitude , phase at maximum light , magnitude of maximum light , and period around the values listed in the quest catalogue .",
    "we also explored the parameters around the @xmath37 alias periods .",
    "the ephemerides for the rr_ab _ stars in the quest catalogue were more secure because they were already determined from light curve fitting and because period aliases were less of a problem for them .",
    "however , the period was not allowed to vary in the fitting .",
    "this time it was allowed to vary in the fitting , but the resulting light curves are not significantly different from the old ones . only in 5 cases",
    "were the changes in period equal to or slightly larger than @xmath38 days .",
    "the ephemerides that yielded the best fits to the light curves for the rr_c _ and rr_ab _ stars have been adopted here and are listed in table  [ tab - velocities ] .",
    "the metallicities of the rrls have been measured from the spectrograms following the methodology and calibration of @xcite , which is based on freeman & rodgers ( 1975 ) modification of the @xcite @xmath39s method .",
    "the method , which involves plotting the pseudo - equivalent width of the ca ii k line ( w(k ) ) , corrected for interstellar absorption , against the mean pseudo - equivalent widths of the @xmath32 , @xmath40 , and @xmath6 balmer lines ( w(h ) ) , is described in detail in @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the type c rrls are less numerous than the type ab in old stellar populations , e.g. globular clusters , and because they are harder to detect than type ab , their number in rrls surveys of the field suffer more from incompleteness .",
    "@xcite did not produce a [ fe / h ] calibration for type c rrls , which were ignored in his study of the metallicities and kinematics of field rrls .",
    "there is a sufficient number of type c stars in our sample that it is important to measure [ fe / h ] from our spectrograms .",
    "the average type c variable is @xmath41k hotter and has a @xmath42 dex larger surface gravity than the average type ab variable , although the types overlap in both quantities , particularly when the type ab variables are hottest during their pulsations .",
    "the layden calibration may therefore require no modification when measuring type c rrls .",
    "this is supported by kemper s ( 1982 ) demonstration that the @xmath39s method , which was devised for type ab variables , can be applied to type c , and more directly by @xcite , who found that both types of variables in same globular cluster define a tight sequence in a plot of k line strength against hydrogen line strength with some intermingling of the types along the sequence .",
    "however , @xcite defined their k line and h line strengths differently than did @xcite .    to see if layden s calibration can be applied to the type c , we observed both type c and type ab variables in the globular cluster m3 with the hydra multiobject spectrograph on the wiyn telescope .",
    "while the fiber setup targeted a large number of variables of both types in this variable - rich cluster , the combination of partly cloudy weather and variable fiber throughputs limited the number of usable spectra to 8 type c stars and 10 type ab .",
    "analyses of high dispersion spectrograms of red giants @xcite and rrls @xcite and the tightness of the red giant branch in the color - magnitude diagram of m3 indicate that there is very little if any variation in [ fe / h ] among the stars in this cluster . for our purposes",
    ", we assume that there is no real star to star scatter and investigate whether layden s calibration yields the same [ fe / h ] when applied separately to the two types of rrls .    our measurements for the m3 rrls in the layden pseudo - equivalent width system are plotted in figure  [ fig - feh ] , where different symbols are used to depict the type ab and type c stars .",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] obtained from all 10 of the type ab variables is @xmath43 with a standard deviation of 0.27 .",
    "the large scatter is undoubtedly due to the low s / n of some of the spectrograms .",
    "the 5 type ab rrls ( filled squares in figure  [ fig - feh ] ) for which we have the highest s / n spectrograms ( @xmath44 at the caii k line ) yield @xmath45[fe / h]@xmath46 with a more reasonable std . dev . of 0.14 .",
    "the 8 type c variables yield @xmath45[fe / h]@xmath47 ( std .",
    "@xmath48 ) , and the 5 that have spectrograms with @xmath49 yield @xmath45[fe / h]@xmath50 ( std . dev .",
    "@xmath51 ) .",
    "the high s / n samples differ in @xmath45[fe / h]@xmath52 by @xmath53 , which suggests that the offset , if any , between the type ab and c variables is small .",
    "since these mean values agree well with zinn & west s ( 1984 ) result for m3 ( [ fe / h ] = -1.66 with an internal precision of @xmath54 ) , layden s calibration appears to be equally applicable to type c and type ab rrls .",
    "the metallicities that we have derived from the spectrograms of our program stars are listed in the last column of table  [ tab - observations ] .",
    "the majority of the spectrograms have @xmath55 , and from the experiences with the m3 variables , we estimate that the precision obtained from one spectrogram is @xmath56 for the type ab variables and @xmath57 for the type c. the lower precision for the type c rrls is consequence of the convergence of the constant [ fe / h ] lines at large w(h ) ( see figure  [ fig - feh ] ) .",
    "a few spectrograms have @xmath58 , and the [ fe / h ] values derived from them are marked with colons in table  [ tab - observations ] .",
    "layden s calibration breaks down for type ab variables that are observed on the rising branch , where the strength of the k line is reduced by the relatively large effective gravity and shock waves may produce emission in the cores of the h lines that reduce their equivalent widths .",
    "we have discarded measurements [ fe / h ] that were made at phases where these effects are likely to be important .",
    "the surface gravity variations of the type c variables are milder , and the equivalent widths of the h lines are not affected by emission .",
    "none of their measurements have been discarded .",
    "radial velocities for all blue spectra were obtained by fourier cross - correlation ( iraf s _ fxcor _ task ) with radial velocity standard stars of a and f spectral type , in the spectral range @xmath59  .",
    "the radial velocity standards were separated in two groups according to their effective temperature .",
    "each target star was cross - correlated with 6 to 14 different standard spectra of the group with more similar effective temperature . for each spectrum",
    ", we obtained a mean radial velocity , @xmath60 , by weighting the result from each standard by the cross - correlation error returned by _ fxcor_.",
    "this error depends on both the s / n of the spectra and the similarity between the target star and the standard .    in order to estimate the radial velocity errors produced by the different telescope - spectrograph combinations , we cross - correlated each spectrum of the radial velocity standards with the spectra of the other standards , taking care to avoid cross - correlating two spectra of the same star . reassuringly , the differences between the mean velocities from these correlations and the literature values were close to zero for all of the standards with each instrumental setup .",
    "we adopted the standard deviations of these differences as the minimum error in velocity that we can achieve with a particular setup for our target stars ( 16 , 8 , and 12 km / s for the smarts , wiyn blue , and eso 1.5 m spectra , respectively ) . because these errors include the uncertainties in the zero - points of the wavelength calibrations , we believe that these values better reflect the true errors than the means of the cross - correlation errors from _ fxcor _ , which are smaller .    cross - correlation was not used to calculate the radial velocities of the red hydra spectra because the subtraction of the strongest night - sky lines left residuals in some wavelength regions . instead",
    ", gaussian line profiles were fitted to the unblended paschen lines of hydrogen and/or the two strongest lines of ca ii , which however at the resolution of the spectrograms are each blended with a paschen line .",
    "the ca ii lines were only measured in spectra that were taken at the coolest phases of the type ab variables when the paschen lines are much weaker than the ca ii lines . before computing the radial velocities from the ca ii lines",
    ", we made slight adjustments to their wavelengths to take into account the blending .",
    "these were estimated from high s / n spectrograms of bright stars of known velocity whose spectra resemble the type ab variables at minimum light . to test this method , we obtained with the smarts 1.5 m telescope red spectra of 6 bright type ab rrls during cloudy weather .",
    "the velocities obtained from the measurements of the ca ii lines did not systematically deviated from the ones measured from the paschen lines alone , and the systemic velocities ( see below ) obtained for these stars agreed with values in the literature . for the red hydra spectra , the standard deviation of the mean of the velocities given by the individual lines ranged from 4 to 10 @xmath13 , which is consistent with the results obtained from similar spectra of bright stars of known velocity .",
    "the best technique for obtaining the radial velocity of the center of mass ( the systemic velocity , @xmath61 ) of a type ab rrls is to integrate the radial velocity curve given by weak metal lines over the whole pulsational cycle , and the results obtained for rrls in globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are consistent with the radial velocities of the clusters to within the internal velocity dispersions of a few @xmath13 . in our low resolution spectrograms ,",
    "the weak lines produce poorly determined peaks in the cross - correlations , whereas well - defined ones are produced by the balmer lines and other strong features .",
    "furthermore , we could not obtain sufficiently large numbers of spectra to determine the velocity curve for each star .",
    "for the rr_ab _ , we adopted instead the method described by @xcite , which involves measuring the velocities at a few phases ( @xmath62 ) from low resolution spectrograms and then fitting them with the radial velocity curve of the ab variable x arietis that @xcite obtained from measurements of @xmath63 .",
    "observations made near maximum light ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) were not used in these fits because the radial velocity curve undergoes a large discontinuity in this region ( see for example * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the velocity curve that is determined from the h lines has a larger amplitude and differs in other ways from the one given by the metals lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , layden s ( 1994 ) comparisons of his measurements of @xmath61 with literature values for the same stars indicates that this method produces results that are consistent with the errors of the measurements and the fits of the velocity curve . in the case of the template star x ari ,",
    "the systemic velocity is equal to the h line velocity at @xmath66 , but there is some small star to star variation in this value . in our calculation of the errors in @xmath61 , we have included terms to account for this variation and for the variation in the amplitudes of the radial velocity curve ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for rr_c",
    "_ stars , which have much smaller velocity amplitudes than the rr_ab _ , there are at most small offsets between the velocity curves given by the metal lines and the h lines .",
    "to measure @xmath61 , we fitted a template constructed by combining the radial velocity curves of t sex and dh peg ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - lc ] shows the best fit for each star having two or more observations .",
    "these plots include all of the radial velocity measurements for a star , even if they were not used in the fits because they are close to @xmath67 . in each case , these points lie within the expected range , which provides a check that our measurements do not suffer from large systematic errors .",
    "notice also that six of the stars were observed with two different telescopes , and the consistency of the measurements , as seen in figure  [ fig - lc ] , is also an indication that large systematic errors are not present .    in the fitting of the radial velocity curves ,",
    "the data were weighted by their errors .",
    "the mean difference between the data points and the radial velocity curve , @xmath68 , in most cases was of the same size , or smaller , than the typical errors in the individual measurements ( see table  [ tab - velocities ] ) .",
    "for the rr_c _ , we calculated the error in the systemic velocity by combining the individual @xmath69 in the usual manner for calculating the @xmath70 of a weighted mean value .",
    "for both types of stars , if @xmath68 was larger than @xmath71 we adopted the former as our final error in the systemic velocity . the mean error in the systemic velocities of all , but one , rrls range from 7 to 28 @xmath13 , with a mean value of 17 @xmath13 .",
    "one star , the type c # 174 , had an unusually bad fit of the radial velocity curve and its final error is 42 @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we calculated the radial velocity measured by an observer at the sun who is at rest with the galactic center , @xmath72 by    @xmath73    our results are presented in table  [ tab - velocities ] , which lists : i d , coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath6 , the extinction corrected mean v magnitude , the type of rr lyrae star , the period and julian date at maximum light ( see   [ sec - ephemerides ] ) , distance from the sun ( d ) , number of spectra available and number of spectra actually used in the fitting of the radial velocity curve , the error in the fit of the radial velocity curve ( @xmath68 ) , the systemic velocity ( @xmath61 ) and its error ( @xmath71 ) , and the velocity in the galactic rest frame , ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "as noted above , the vod encompasses the entire range in @xmath4 and perhaps a larger range of distance than our sample of rrls . the spatial distribution of our sample of rrls ( see the box in figure  [ fig - quest ] ) does not reveal any regions of exceptionally high density that are strong candidates for halo substructure .",
    "there is a roughly uniform band of stars that crosses the region at distances between 7 and 10 kpc and also a region of relatively high density near @xmath74 kpc within @xmath75 .",
    "this second feature is the near side of the large over - density in rrls that we have referred to as the `` 12.4 hr clump '' @xcite , which at  19 kpc contains the vss @xcite .",
    "figure 12 in @xcite shows the location of the 12.4 hr clump in the first band of the quest survey , but only two of the stars identified there as probable clump members are in our sample .",
    "the addition of rrls from the 2nd quest band makes the clump even more prominent , and there are 9 stars in our sample that now appear to be outliers of the clump .",
    "if the band of stars at @xmath76 kpc and the 12.4 hr clump are real halo substructures , many of the stars should have similar values of @xmath72 .",
    "figure  [ fig - vgsr_histo ] is a histogram of @xmath77 of the whole sample of rrls .",
    "the mean velocity is @xmath78 @xmath13 , and the standard deviation is @xmath79 @xmath13 .",
    "these values disagree with recent measurements of samples of bhb stars in the halo ( see below ) . for a sample of 1170 bhb stars",
    ", @xcite found a line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath80 @xmath81 , and @xmath82 @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite found a similar @xmath83 in their sample of bhb selected from the 2mass survey , although they noted that the velocity dispersion increased to @xmath84 @xmath13 if they selected only the most metal poor stars in their sample to avoid thick disk contamination .",
    "the shapiro - wilk test for normality @xcite indicates that the @xmath72 distribution of our sample does not deviate significantly from a normal distribution .",
    "it seems safe , therefore , to use the student t - test and the f - test , which reject with @xmath85 confidence that our sample has the same mean velocity and velocity dispersion as the bhb sample of @xcite .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion of our sample is not significantly different from the value @xcite obtained for their most metal - poor bhb stars . while these differences may be another sign that rrls and bhb stars in the halo have different kinematics ( see below and *",
    "* ) , the halo substructure in our sample is definitely a major contributor to its relatively large velocity dispersion and its positive mean velocity .    while not statistically different from a normal curve , the histogram in figure  [ fig - vgsr_histo ] is clearly unexpected for a random selection of halo objects , for it has a very prominent peak at @xmath86 @xmath13 . in total",
    ", there are eight rrls , or 19% of our sample that have @xmath87 @xmath81 , which is very unlikely to be random occurrence ( 1 in 10,000 , if @xmath80 @xmath13 and@xmath82 ) .",

    "we conclude on the basis of these comparisons that none of the halo substructures that we have detected are probably due to the leading arm .",
    "moreover , based on the current sgr models , our observations imply that the shape of the galactic potential can be neither oblate nor spherical .",
    "@xcite note that in their oblate model the trailing stream of sgr crosses through the region of the vss and coincides with the vss in @xmath72 ( @xmath189 km / s ) .",

    "kinematical information is crucial to detect substructures in regions where no obvious spatial overdensities are present . taken together , our rrls sample , the bhb star sample of @xcite , and the f star sample of @xcite paint a consistent picture that several separate halo substructures exist at @xmath190 kpc in the part of the vod that is covered by the quest survey .",
    "the rrls sample of @xcite and the same bhb and f star samples show that some of these substructures extend to larger @xmath8 . none of these substructures seem to be related with the sgr leading tail .",
    "the analysis of the sdss photometric data by @xcite make a compelling case that the region of highest stellar density in s297 + 63 - 20.5 lies at @xmath191 kpc .",
    "this is identical to within the errors of the region of highest density in the 12.4 hr clump of quest rrls , which is where @xcite discovered the vss in velocity space .",
    "the near coincidence in @xmath178 between the vss and the largest peak in @xmath72 that @xcite observed in s297 + 63 - 20.5 provides strong evidence that they are the same . as noted by @xcite , the small offset ( @xmath192 @xmath13 )",
    "could be due to measurement error and/or by the small sizes of the samples of spectroscopically observed stars .",
    "it is also possible that it is due to a gradient in @xmath72 with @xmath8 ( see above ) .",
    "@xcite found the same velocity peak in their two spectroscopic fields , which indicates that the s297 + 63 - 20.5/ vss has considerable angular extent on the sky .",
    "other evidence for this is provided by the recent rrls surveys by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite found 2 clumps of rrls south of the vod region ( see figure  [ fig - zone ] ) at coordinates @xmath193 and @xmath194 and distances 16 and 19 kpc respectively .",
    "velocity information is not yet available for these clumps .",
    "@xcite identified an excess of candidate rrls having @xmath195 @xmath13 in the north galactic cap ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "the results presented here indicate that the s297 + 63 - 20.5/vss feature may also extend along the line of sight to distances as close as @xmath197 kpc .",
    "we conclude that the vod contains at least one relatively large structure , s297 + 63 - 20.5 /vss , which is intersperced with smaller halo substructures that are unrelated to s297 + 63 - 20.5/vss or to each other .",
    "while these smaller structures might be peculiar to the vod region , it is more likely that they are common in the outer halo .",
    "they are better documented in the vod direction simply because the presence of s297 + 63 - 20.5/ vss has drawn attention to this region . in the case of our sample of rrls ,",
    "the spatial distribution of the stars provided only very marginal evidence of any substructure @xcite .",
    "the picture changed dramatically when we used spatial and velocity data together .",
    "there is already strong evidence from the spatial distribution of stars in the sdss that much , if not all , of the outer halo was accreted from the destroyed of satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "our investigation of the vod region suggests that the addition of velocity data will make the case even stronger .",
    "this research was supported by the national science foundation under grants ast 00 - 98428 and ast 05 - 07364 .",
    "the availability of the smarts 1.5 m telescope and its service observing mode made this project feasible .",
    "we thank charles bailyn for his efforts to setup the smarts consortium and fred walter and suzanne tourtellotte for their assistance with smarts operations and data handling .",
    "we are indebted to the service mode observers sergio gonzalez , alberto pasten , claudio aguilera and alberto miranda for their fine operation of the telescope and the spectrograph .",
