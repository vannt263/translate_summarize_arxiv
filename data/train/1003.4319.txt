    "until recently , the numerous puzzles in the prediction of quarkonium - production rates at hadron colliders were attributed to non - perturbative effects associated with channels in which the heavy quark and antiquark are produced in a colour - octet state  @xcite .",
    "it is now widely accepted that @xmath7 and @xmath8 corrections to the csm  @xcite are fundamental for understanding the @xmath2 spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath9 produced in high - energy hadron collisions  @xcite .",
    "the effect of qcd corrections is also manifest in the polarisation predictions .",
    "while the @xmath0 and @xmath9 ( commonly denoted @xmath10 hereafter ) produced inclusively or in association with a photon are predicted to be transversally polarised at lo , it has been recently emphasised that their polarisation at nlo is increasingly longitudinal when @xmath2 gets larger @xcite .    in a recent work  @xcite",
    ", we have also shown that hard subprocesses based on colour singlet @xmath11 configurations alone are sufficient to account for the observed magnitude of the @xmath2-integrated cross section .",
    "in particular , the predictions at lo  @xcite ( fig .  [ diagrams ] ( a ) ) and nlo  @xcite ( fig .  [ diagrams ] ( b , c , d ) ) accuracy are both compatible with the measurements by the phenix collaboration at rhic  @xcite within the present uncertainties .",
    "this provided some indications that the computations are carried in a proper perturbative regime .",
    "this agreement is improved when hard subprocesses involving the charm - quark distribution of the colliding protons are taken into consideration .",
    "these constitute part of the lo ( @xmath12 ) rate ( fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ( e ) ) and are responsible for a significant fraction of the observed yield , as we have argued in  @xcite .",
    "+    in this letter , we proceed to the evaluation of the @xmath2 dependence of the polarisation of the  produced at rhic , both in the central and forward rapidity regions . in the section 2 ,",
    "we expose the procedure used to compute the yield and the polarisation at nlo ( up to @xmath13 ) from @xmath14 & @xmath15 fusion and from @xmath16 fusion at lo ( at @xmath12 ) as well as the procedure to obtain a first evaluation of the leading @xmath2 contributions from @xmath14 and @xmath15 fusion at @xmath3 ( nnlo@xmath4 ) . in the section 3",
    ", we present our results .",
    "first , we show the yields differential in the rapidity @xmath17 and @xmath2 along with the polarisation vs @xmath2 from @xmath14 & @xmath15 and from @xmath16 fusion separately .",
    "then we show our results when they are combined .",
    "finally we combine the latter predictions for the direct yield polarisation with an essentially data - driven estimation of the polarisation for @xmath0 from @xmath6 and we compare our results with the phenix data in both rapidity ranges .",
    "the last section gathers our conclusions .",
    "in the csm  @xcite , the matrix element to create a @xmath18 quarkonium @xmath19 of momentum @xmath20 and polarisation @xmath21 accompanied by other partons , noted @xmath22 , is the product of the amplitude to create the corresponding heavy - quark pair , a spin projector @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the radial wave function at the origin in the configuration space , obtained from the leptonic width  @xcite , namely @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28,@xmath29 are the heavy - quark spin and @xmath30 is the projector onto a colour - singlet state . in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath23 can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the polarisation vector of the quarkonium .",
    "the sum over the quark spin yields to traces evaluated in a standard way .    in our evaluation",
    ", we use the partonic matrix elements from campbell , maltoni and tramontano  @xcite to compute the lo and nlo cross sections from gluon - gluon and light - quark gluon fusion .",
    "we guide the reader to  @xcite for details concerning the derivation of the cross section at @xmath13 , the corresponding expressions at @xmath12 can be found in  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath16 fusion ( at lo )",
    ", we use the framework described in  @xcite based on the tree - level matrix element generator madonia  @xcite .    moreover , in order to illustrate the expected impact of nnlo qcd corrections for increasing @xmath2 , we also present the results when the leading-@xmath2 contributions at @xmath3 evaluated along the lines of  @xcite are added to the previous contributions . at this order , the last kinematically - enhanced topologies open up .",
    "these exhibit a @xmath33 fall off of their differential cross section in @xmath34 , typical of a single particle exchange in the @xmath35 channel .",
    "going further in the @xmath36 expansion can not bring any further kinematical enhancement as regards the @xmath2 dependence . as a consequence , above @xmath3",
    ", usual expectations for the impact of qcd corrections would then hold and these should be then well taken into account by a @xmath37 factor multiplying the yield at nnlo accuracy , which would be independent of @xmath2 and of a similar magnitude as those of other qcd processes .",
    "in other words , a further cross - section modification between the nnlo and n@xmath38lo results by an order of magnitude would not be acceptable at any @xmath2 , while it is expected to be so between the cross sections at lo ( @xmath39 ) , nlo ( @xmath40 ) and nnlo ( @xmath33 ) for large enough @xmath2 , simply owing to their different @xmath2 scalings .",
    "the procedure used here to evaluate the leading-@xmath2 nnlo contributions is exactly the same as in  @xcite .",
    "namely , the real - emission contributions at @xmath3 are evaluated using madonia by imposing a lower bound on the invariant - mass of any light partons ( @xmath41 ) . for the new channels opening up at @xmath42 with a leading-@xmath2 behaviour , and which specifically interest us , the dependence on this cut is to get smaller for large @xmath2 since no collinear or soft divergences can appear there .",
    "for other channels , whose born contribution is at @xmath43 or @xmath44 , the cut would produce logarithms of @xmath45 , which are not necessarily small .",
    "nevertheless , they can be factorised over their corresponding born contribution , which scales as @xmath39 or @xmath40 , and are thence suppressed by at least two powers of @xmath2 with respect of the leading-@xmath2 contributions ( @xmath33 ) . the sensitivity on @xmath46",
    "is thus expected to come to nothing at large @xmath2 .",
    "this argument has been checked at @xmath44 ( nlo vs. nlo@xmath4 ) for @xmath9  @xcite and @xmath47  @xcite in the inclusive case as well as in association with a photon  @xcite .    for the parameters entering the cross - section evaluation , we have taken @xmath48 gev@xmath38 .",
    "we also take br@xmath49 . neglecting relativistic corrections ,",
    "one has in the csm , @xmath50 .",
    "the uncertainty bands for the resulting predictions at lo and nlo are obtained from the _ combined _ variations of the heavy - quark mass within the ranges @xmath51 gev , the factorisation @xmath52 and the renormalisation @xmath53 scales chosen in the couples @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the band for the nnlo@xmath4 is obtained for simplicity using a combined variation of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 gev@xmath59 .",
    "the polarisation parameter @xmath60 ( also called @xmath21 ) is computed by analysing the distribution of the polar angle @xmath61 between the @xmath62 direction in the quarkonium rest frame and the quarkonium direction in the laboratory frame .",
    "this definition of @xmath61 is referred to the analysis of the polarisation ( or spin - alignement ) in the helicity frame .",
    "the normalised angular distribution @xmath63 reads @xmath64 from which we can extract @xmath60 bin by bin in @xmath17 or @xmath2 .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath60 is immediate when one relates it to the polarised cross sections : @xmath65     in  collisions at @xmath66 at lo and nlo accuracy compared to the phenix data  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical - error bands for lo and nlo come from combining the uncertainties resulting from the choice of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "we have used the lo set cteq6_l  @xcite for the yield at lo , the nlo set cteq6_m  @xcite for the yield at nlo . ]    for @xmath70 , thus for a yield purely transversally polarised , @xmath71 while for @xmath72 ( a yield purely longitudinally polarised ) , @xmath73 . on the contrary , if no direction is favoured , one expects @xmath74 , which corresponds to @xmath75 , and thus no @xmath61 dependence .",
    "we emphasise here that the relations eq .   and eq .   do not depend on the definition chosen for @xmath61 ( the frame definition ) . yet",
    ", the results obtained do depend on it : a yield transversally polarised in one frame can be longitudinal in another . in particular , the expressions that one would obtain for @xmath76 and @xmath77 change from one frame to another .",
    "we first present the results from the @xmath14 and @xmath15 channels at lo ( @xmath12 ) and nlo ( @xmath12+@xmath13 ) in terms of differential cross sections as function of @xmath17 and @xmath2 , which we compare to the experimental data for prompt @xmath0 multiplied by the expected fraction of direct @xmath0 ( @xmath78 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the experimental data for the @xmath2 integrated cross section from phenix  @xcite are qualitatively well reproduced by the highest value of the theoretical bands , both at lo and nlo ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : dsigdy - gg ] ) .",
    "let us also note that choosing a lower value than 1.4 gev for the charm quark mass  along the same lines as what has been done in studies of charm production at rhic  @xcite would lead to higher cross sections .",
    "however a part of the increase of the cross section could be attributed to the approximation @xmath50 , which would then induce an artificially low bound - state mass in the kinematics .",
    "such an effect is not easily quantifiable without a dedicated study .",
    "therefore , we do not use values lower than 1.4 gev for @xmath56 here .    before discussing the results of the cross section differential in @xmath2 at lo and nlo",
    ", it is important to note that we are working in the low @xmath2 region where the perturbative expansion is not always reliable . while the comparison between the results at lo and nlo integrated in @xmath2 shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdy - gg ] gives some good indication that the perturbative expansion works well , it may not be so when one considers the cross section differential in @xmath2 .",
    "first , the yield at nlo has shown negative thence unphysical values in some bins in @xmath2 and @xmath17 .",
    "when this occurs , this is always for the lowest @xmath2 bin .",
    "this shows that the virtual corrections at @xmath13 ( with a negative relative sign ) are large",
    ". this may also be the case for the virtual corrections at @xmath3 which are currently unknown and possibly with an opposite sign to the ones at @xmath13 .",
    "this is a known issue which can be partly solved by resumming initial state radiation ( isr ) .",
    "such a resummation has been carried out for the @xmath9 production at the tevatron using the colour evaporation model  @xcite .",
    "one of the main outcomes of the latter study is that the @xmath2 dependence of the cross section is significantly affected at low @xmath2 ( up to roughly @xmath79 ) by isr .",
    "a similar impact of isr is expected for the charmonium family , albeit for a narrower range in @xmath2 .    since we have not carried out this resummation , the results that we have obtained for @xmath2 below @xmath80 for @xmath81 shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdpt - gg ] ( as well as later for the polarisation ) are to be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "that being said , one sees on fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdpt - gg ] that the slope for the yield at nlo is milder than for the lo , though too steep to reproduce the data from phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite .",
    "yet , the general effect of isr is to lower the cross section at very low @xmath2 and to rise it a little up to @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , one expects a significant contribution from @xmath3 contributions at larger @xmath2 .",
    "a complete evaluation of nnlo corrections is not yet available . for",
    "now , we can only rely on a study of the leading-@xmath2 nnlo contributions ( nnlo@xmath4 ) as done in  @xcite .",
    "however , for such low values of @xmath2 , the latter method is a priori not reliable and we could not extend its evaluation ( red band ) in  fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdy - gg ] ( a )   band in  fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdpt - gg ] ( b ) since the range in @xmath2 is limited : star measurements are focused on the central region for the time being . ] below @xmath83 gev .",
    "overall , the comparison presented allows us to think that a more complete analysis ( through isr resummation and matching with leading @xmath2 contributions for instance ) could show that the @xmath2 dependence given by the csm agrees with the experimental measurements in the low and mid @xmath2 regions at rhic energies .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the polarisation results vs @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_vs_pt ] ) in the helicity frame . as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_vs_pt ] , the complete modification of the polarisation pattern between the lo and the nlo results observed in previous works  @xcite is confirmed , despite the error band due to the usual mass and scale dependence on top of statistical fluctuations ( see below ) . the lo transverse yield becomes increasingly longitudinal at nlo for increasing @xmath2 . in the forward region ,",
    "the yield at nlo is transverse at low @xmath2 and becomes longitudinal as soon as @xmath84 .    as discussed previously ,",
    "the result obtained in the lowest @xmath2 bin ( below 1 gev ) are likely to be subject to higher qcd corrections and the band should not be extrapolated down to @xmath85 .",
    "second , the extraction of the yield polarisation at nlo at low @xmath2 is highly demanding in terms of computer time .",
    "typically , the evaluation of the yield polarisation in a single @xmath2 bin of 500 mev with statistical fluctuation less than 20 @xmath86 requires @xmath87 numerical evaluations of the integrand .",
    "these fluctuations add up to the usual theoretical uncertainties in the bands shown on  fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_vs_pt ] .",
    "we first present the results from the @xmath16 lo ( @xmath12 ) in terms of differential cross sections as function of @xmath17 and @xmath2 , which we compare to the experimental data for prompt @xmath0 multiplied by the expected fraction of direct @xmath0 .     from @xmath16 fusion in  at @xmath66 using a sealike charm distribution compared to the phenix data  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical - error bands for lo and nlo come from combining the uncertainties resulting from the choice of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 . ]    in  @xcite , we have computed the yield integrated over @xmath2 from @xmath16 channels and used the lo set cteq6.5c  @xcite based on a recent global pdf fit including intrinsic charm ( ic ) .",
    "more precisely , we have compared the results for three choices for the charm distribution : ( i ) without ic [ @xmath88 ( @xmath89 gev ) ] , ( ii ) with bhps ic  @xcite ( @xmath90 dx=}2\\%$ ] ) and ( iii ) with sealike ic ( @xmath91 ) . in the following",
    ", we shall carry on our study of the polarisation with the sealike ic .",
    "the result are qualitatively the same with other choice for @xmath92 .    by comparing the data to our results for the contribution from @xmath16 fusion shown on  fig .  [",
    "fig : plot - dsigdy - cg ] , one sees that it accounts for 5 to 40 @xmath86 of the observed yield depending on the usual theoretical uncertainties .",
    "comparable fractions are obtained for other @xmath92 as discussed in  @xcite .    regarding the @xmath2 dependence shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : plot - dsigdpt - cg ] for both rapidity regions , one observes that the contribution is falling too fast compared to the phenix data .",
    "nevertheless , the appearance of nlo contribution such as @xmath93 ( _ e.g. _  fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ( f ) ) at larger @xmath2 , and to a lesser extent the effect of isr at small @xmath2 , is expected to smear the curve out to larger @xmath2 .    to what concerns the polarisation pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pol - cg ] ) , in the central region , it is similar to the one computed for @xmath94 in  @xcite , namely nearly unpolarised as soon as @xmath95 , although not completely unpolarised with @xmath96 for mid @xmath2 . in the forward region , it becomes somewhat more transversally polarised and shows a dependence on the mass and scale choices as indicated by the widening band .      in order to obtain the polarisation of the direct yield , one has to combine the polarisation from both contributions taking into account their proper weight .",
    "schematically one has : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the differential cross section for one given process integrated in a given bin in @xmath17 and @xmath2 .",
    "beforehand , we present results for the nlo@xmath99 yield , namely the yield at nlo accuracy from @xmath14 and @xmath15 fusion added to the yield from @xmath16 fusion at lo accuracy are not yet known . ] .",

    "the computation being close to the data for @xmath100 gev , it is reasonable to compare them to the phenix measurements  @xcite as done on  fig .",
    "[ fig : pol - nlo_plus ] .    except for the lowest @xmath2 point in the central region ,",
    "the direct nlo@xmath99 yield polarisation is compatible with the ( prompt ) data bin from 2 to 4 gev , the yield is not perfectly described by the nlo@xmath99  the deviation is slightly larger than 1 @xmath101 .",
    "further contributions , such as the @xmath3 ones , may need to be taken into account , in turn altering the results presented here for the polarisation .",
    "] , indicating a small impact of the @xmath102 and @xmath6 feed - downs on the polarisation .",
    "the same conclusion holds from the @xmath103-channel cut analysis  @xcite , where a good agreement with experimental data was also obtained , at least in the central region .",
    "it is worth recalling that the latter analysis was done by neglecting the usual contribution from the csm which are the purpose of this work and are evidently not negligible .",
    "since the results for the polarisation are similar in both analysis , a combined study would follow the same trend .",
    "finally , the disagreement between the data and the present evaluation in the lowest @xmath2 bin is not worrisome in view of the expected impact of higher qcd corrections in this bin .      for the time being , there exists no measurement of the direct @xmath0 polarisation after extraction of both the @xmath104 and @xmath6 feed - downs . while at rhic energy the former contributes less than 5 % of the full yield  @xcite and thence should not affect its polarisation , the @xmath6 feed - down ( up to 30 - 40 % ) may impact strongly on the observed values of @xmath60 .",
    "it is however possible to constrain its effects by using existing data from hera-@xmath104 on @xmath105 for instance , relying on the dominance of the e1 transition between the @xmath6 s and the @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , using e1 dominance  @xcite , one can obtain a first approximation of the yield of longitudinally ( transversally ) polarised @xmath0 , denoted @xmath106 ( resp .",
    "@xmath107 ) from the parent @xmath6 , in terms of simple and that of its decay product ( the @xmath0 here ) .",
    "these effects are expected to vanish for large momenta for the quarkonium .",
    "such an approximation may not be accurate for the smallest @xmath2 s considered here .",
    "] relations involving the polarised @xmath6 yields , these are @xmath108 and @xmath109    let us analyse now the two otherwise extreme cases @xmath110 and @xmath111 :    * @xmath110 is reached when @xmath112 is maximised and @xmath113 minimised .",
    "this happens when the @xmath114 yield is fully @xmath115 and the @xmath116 one is fully @xmath117 .",
    "this indeed gives @xmath118 and thus @xmath119 .",
    "* @xmath111 is reached when @xmath112 is minimised and @xmath113 maximised .",
    "this happens for a @xmath114 yield fully @xmath120 and the @xmath116 one fully @xmath115 .",
    "this gives :    @xmath121    recently , the hera - b  @xcite and cdf  @xcite collaborations have measured the ratio of @xmath122 which we can therefore use in  eq .  .",
    "it is however worth noticing that both results are somewhat different , @xmath123 for hera - b for @xmath124 gev at @xmath125 gev and @xmath126 for cdf for @xmath127 gev at @xmath128 tev .",
    "since we focus here on low @xmath2 data , we prefer to opt for the hera - b value , which gives for the central value @xmath129    supposing that about @xmath130 of the @xmath0 come from @xmath6 decays independent of @xmath2 in the range considered here , we expect a partial contribution to the polarisation ranging from @xmath131 to @xmath132 . regarding the other @xmath133 , one can simply multiply the result obtained above for the direct yields ( section 3.3 ) by @xmath134 , since in a good approximation the polarisation of @xmath0 from @xmath102 is expected to be identical to the direct one .      combining the result",
    "obtained for the direct yield at nlo@xmath99 and the extreme expected polarisations of @xmath0 from @xmath6 , one can compare ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_prompt ] ) our results for the csm prompt @xmath0 yield with the phenix data in the central  @xcite and the forward  @xcite regions . within the present admittedly large theoretical uncertainties , the agreement with the data is good .",

    "i.e. _  for a momentum fraction of the charm quark in the proton approaching the value where @xmath139 peaks .",
    "yet , a dedicated study of these effects is needed to draw more quantitative conclusions . indeed , depending on the relative yield of @xmath14 & @xmath15 fusion at nnlo@xmath4 and @xmath16 fusion at lo ( or nlo@xmath4 ) at large @xmath2",
    ", the polarisation may end up to be strongly longitudinal or slightly transversal .",
    "in any case , as opposed to non - relativistic qcd analyses of including colour octets  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a recent application for rhic energies ) transitions , the csm yield is not expected to become strongly transverse for increasing @xmath2 .",
    "our results for @xmath14 and @xmath140 fusion are in qualitative agreement with the analysis carried out by baranov and szczurek  @xcite using the @xmath141 factorisation approach .",
    "however the latter study predicts a dominance of @xmath142 feed down over the prompt @xmath0 yield which may conflict both with the preliminary upper value  @xcite for the @xmath6 feed down ( @xmath143 at 90% c.l . ) by the phenix collaboration and with the hera - b results for the ratio @xmath105 .",
    "we further note that some contributions appearing at @xmath3 and enhanced by @xmath144  @xcite also produce a yield which is mainly longitudinal .",
    "in conclusion , we have carried out the first nlo analysis in the colour - singlet model of the polarisation of the direct @xmath0 yield at rhic including contributions from @xmath145-quark  gluon fusion .",
    "our result for the yield differential in @xmath2 is in near agreement with the measurement at low and mid @xmath2 both in the central and forward rapidity regions .",
    "as regards the polarisation , our evaluation for the direct yield is in good agreement with the phenix data for _ prompt _ @xmath0 .",
    "this therefore points at a small impact of the feed - downs on this observable in this kinematical region .    using constraints from existing data , namely the fraction of @xmath6 feed - down and the ratio @xmath105 , we have determined likely extreme values of the polarisation of the @xmath0 from @xmath6 by relying on the e1 dominance of the transition @xmath146 .",
    "this has enabled us to extrapolate our polarisation evaluation of the direct yield to the prompt one .",
    "the results obtained are also in good agreement with the phenix data",
    ".    motivated by this agreement , the next step would be to study the cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects on the yield polarisation in the csm framework .",
    "these effects are expected to come mainly from the shadowing of parton distributions and the final - state interactions between the @xmath147 pair and the cnm .",
    "we could for instance take benefit of the glauber framework jin  @xcite used in @xcite to study the cnm effects on the @xmath0 yield in @xmath148 and @xmath149 collisions at rhic ; the latter can indeed deal with the polarisation information",

    "<S> we find a reasonable agreement with the data . regarding the polarisation , as shown for previous studies at larger @xmath5 and @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the polarisation pattern from gluon and light quark fusion in the helicity frame is drastically modified at nlo and is shown to be increasingly longitudinal . the yield from charm - gluon fusion </S>",
    "<S> is found to be slightly transversally polarised . </S>",
    "<S> combining both these contributions with a data - driven range for the polarisation of @xmath0 from @xmath6 , we eventually provide an evaluation of the polarisation of the prompt @xmath0 yield which is in a good agreement with the experimental data from phenix both in the central and forward regions .    </S>",
