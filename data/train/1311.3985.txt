    "then , for a fixed bernoulli function @xmath15 , the condition @xmath34 for @xmath35 implies the existence of a unique critical speed @xmath36 so that the flow can be classified by subsonic - sonic or supersonic by @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the steady euler equations for compressible fluids are of composite - mixed type , which is determined by the mach number @xmath39 .",
    "that is , the system can be reduced to a system such that two of the equations are elliptic - hyperbolic mixed : elliptic when @xmath40 and hyperbolic when @xmath41 , while the other @xmath42 equations are hyperbolic .",
    "for the homentropic case , there are two mixed characteristics and @xmath43 hyperbolic characteristics .    during the 1950s",
    ", the effort on system was focused mainly on the irrotational case , namely when @xmath44 is constrained to satisfy the additional equation @xmath45 .",
    "since the equations of uniform subsonic flow possess ellipticity , solutions have better regularity than those corresponding to transonic or supersonic flow . the airfoil problem for irrotational , two - dimensional subsonic flow was solved ; _ cf . _ frankl - keldysh @xcite , shiffman @xcite , bers @xcite , and finn - gilbarg @xcite .",
    "the first result for three - dimensional subsonic flow past an obstacle was given by finn and gilbarg @xcite under some restrictions on the mach number .",

    ", the global existence of homentropic subsonic flow through two - dimensional infinitely long nozzles was proved in xie - xin @xcite .",

    "duan - luo @xcite recently considered the axisymmetric nozzle problem for the smooth subsonic flow .    on the other hand ,",
    "few results are currently known for the cases of subsonic - sonic flow and transonic flow , since the uniform ellipticity is lost and shocks may be present .",
    "that is , smooth solutions may not exist .",
    "instead , one must consider weak solutions .",
    "morawetz @xcite introduced an approach via compensated compactness to analyze irrotational steady flow of the euler equations .",
    "indeed , morawetz established a compactness framework under the assumption that the solutions are free of stagnation points and cavitation points .",
    "morawetz s result has been improved by chen - slemrod - wang @xcite , who have shown that the approximate solutions away from cavitation are constructed by a viscous perturbation .",
    "the compactness framework for subsonic - sonic irrotational flow allowing for stagnation in two dimensions was due to chen - dafermos - slemrod - wang @xcite by combining the mass conservation , momentum , and irrotational equations .",
    "the key observation in @xcite is that the two - dimensional steady flow can be regarded as a one - dimensional unsteady system of conservation laws , that is , one of the spatial variables can be regarded as the time variable , so that the div - curl lemma can be applied to the two momentum equations .",
    "in fact , the momentum equations are first employed in @xcite to reduce the support of the corresponding young measure to two points , and then the irrotational equation and the mass equation are used to reduce the young measure to a dirac measure . using a similar idea",
    ", xie - xin @xcite investigated the subsonic - sonic limit of the two - dimensional irrotational , infinitely long nozzle problem .",
    "later , in @xcite , they extended the result to the three - dimensional axisymmetric flow through an axisymmetric nozzle .",
    "the compactness framework in the multidimensional irrotational case was established in huang - wang - wang @xcite .",
    "the compactness framework established for irrotational flow no longer applies directly for the steady full euler equations in @xmath0 with @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath48 , the equations can not be reduced to a one - dimensional system of conservation laws . more importantly , the div - curl lemma is no longer valid for the momentum equations , due to the presence of linear characteristics .",
    "one of our main observations is that it is still possible to achieve the same compactness result , _",
    "i.e. _ , to reduce the young measure to a dirac measure , by using only natural weak estimates for the mass balance and the vorticity , along with the bernoulli law and entropy relation , through a more delicate analysis on the phase space .",
    "in particular , the bernoulli function and entropy function play a key role in our proof . we then establish a compactness framework for approximate solutions for steady full euler flows in arbitrary dimension .",
