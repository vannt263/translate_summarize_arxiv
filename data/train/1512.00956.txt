    "energy is fundamental to science in general and the life sciences in particular @xcite . for this reason , the energy - based bond graph modelling method , originally developed in the context of engineering @xcite ,",
    "has been applied to modelling biomolecular systems @xcite .",
    "bond graphs represent the energy consumption per unit time , or power flow , for each component of a given system .",
    "power flows are calculated as the product of appropriately chosen ` signal quantities ' named ` efforts ' and ` flows ' .",
    "examples of effort include force , voltage , pressure and chemical potential . corresponding examples of flow are velocity , current , fluid flow rate and molar flow rate . by describing systems under the unifying principle of energy flows and due to the abstract representation of these flows in terms of generalised effort and flow quantities , the bond graph approach is particularly appropriate for modelling systems with multiple energy domains .",
    "a comprehensive account of the use of bond graphs to model engineering systems is given in the textbooks of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and a tutorial introduction for control engineers is given by @xcite .",
    "chemical reactions are considered by @xcite and @xcite . in particular , as an engineering example , @xcite has looked at chemoelectrical energy flows in hybrid vehicles .",
    "chemoelectrical energy transduction is fundamental to living systems and occurs in a number of contexts including oxidative phosphorylation and chemiosmosis , synaptic transmission and action potentials in excitable membranes .",
    "for this reason , this paper extends the energy - based bond graph modelling of biomolecular systems to biological systems which involve chemoelectrical energy transduction .",
    "a simple model of the action potential in excitable membranes is used as an illustrative example of the general approach .",
    "although such simple models could easily be derived by other means , our general approach could be used to build thermodynamically compliant models of large hierarchical systems such as those describing metabolism , signalling and neural transmission .",
    "understanding the biophysical processes which underlie the generation of the action potential in excitable cells is of considerable interest , and has been the subject of intensive mathematical and computational modelling . since the early work of @xcite on modelling the ionic mechanisms which give rise to the action potential in neurons , mathematical models of the action potential",
    "have incorporated ever - increasing biophysical and ionic detail @xcite , and have been formulated to describe both normal and pathophysiological mechanisms .",
    "generation of the action potential comes at a metabolic cost .",
    "energy is required to maintain the imbalance of ionic species across the membrane , such that when ion channels open there is a flux of ions ( current ) across the membrane  initially carried by sodium ions  generating rapid membrane depolarisation ( the upstroke of the action potential ) .",
    "each action potential reduces the ionic imbalance and each ionic species needs to be transported across the membrane against an adverse electrochemical gradient to restore the imbalance  this requires energy .",
    "the role of energy in neural systems has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite and it has been suggested that metabolic cost is a unifying principle underlying the functional organisation and biophysical properties of neurons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite posed the question `` does impairment of energy metabolism result in excitotoxic neuronal death in neurodegenerative illnesses ? '' more recently , it has been suggested @xcite that an energy - based approach is required to elucidate neuro - degenerative diseases such as parkinson s disease .    in such studies , the flow of @xmath0 across the membrane",
    "is taken as a proxy for energy consumption associated with action potential generation , as @xmath0 has to be pumped back across the membrane by an energy - consuming atpase reaction .",
    "this energetic cost is often quoted as an equivalent number of atp molecules required to restore the ionic concentration gradient through activity of the sodium - potassium atpase ( the na pump ) , as calculated via stoichiometric arguments . while this provides a useful indication of energetic cost , this is however an imprecise approach , which can not produce reliable estimates of energy flows under all conditions ( physiological and pathophysiological ) .",
    "what is required instead is a way of simulating and calculating the actual energy flows associated with these ionic movements through a physically - based modelling approach .    here",
    "we develop a general bond graph based modelling framework that enables explicit calculation of the energy flows involved in moving ions across the cell membrane .",
    "our model can be applied to the regulation of the membrane potential via ion channels in any cell type ",
    "obvious examples include , for example , cardiac and skeletal muscle cells  but in order to give a specific application we investigate the energy cost for generating a neural action potential . because ions carry electrical charge , differences in the concentration of a particular ionic species on either side of a membrane generate both a chemical potential difference due to the concentration gradient as well as an electrical potential difference due to charge imbalance .",
    "we derive a bond graph formulation for the voltage - dependent ionic flow across a membrane that comprises both the classical hodgkin - huxley model and its more detailed variants focussing on the associated flow of energy . one component of this formulation accounts for the behaviour of the ion channel as an electrical resistor that can be investigated experimentally via current - voltage relationships , also known as @xmath1-@xmath2 curves .",
    "popular models for  @xmath1-@xmath2 curves are , for example , the linear  @xmath1-@xmath2 dependency that corresponds to ohm s law and the non - linear goldman - hodgkin - katz ( ghk ) equations .",
    "hodgkin - huxley - like models assume a linear  @xmath1-@xmath2 relationship .",
    "@xcite represented the voltage - dependent opening and closing of ion channels by an empirical model , their gating variables , which led to excellent agreement with experimental data .",
    "this paper replaces this empirical model of gating by an physically - based voltage - dependent markov model with one open and one closed state .",
    "whereas this model accounts for the energy needed for moving the ion channel between conformations where the channel is in an open or a closed state , respectively , the empirical gating variables of the hodgkin - huxley model do not have a similar interpretation .    as our models are formulated using bond graphs , important physical quantities such as mass and energy",
    "are conserved ( in the sense that any dissipative processes are directly accounted for , and any inputs to or losses from the system are quantified ) .",
    "this theoretical approach is then applied to analyse energy consumption in retinal ganglion cells based on _ in vitro _ experimental data collected and analysed from retinal ganglion cells ( rgcs ) of wild - type ( wt ) and degenerative ( rd1 ) mice .",
    "our use of the rd1 degenerate retina mouse model ensures that the outcomes of this project are directly relevant to human patients since rd1 mice have a degenerate retina that has distinct similarities to that observed in human patients with _",
