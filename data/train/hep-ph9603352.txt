    "let us consider a process with unstable but long  living particle(s ) in the initial state .",

    "the appearance of such singularities leads to a divergent cross section . to perform calculations in this case a careful analyses of the physical set ",
    "up is needed .",
    "such situation takes place for a number of processes at muon colliders , for instance , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , ... which have been recently discussed in refs . @xcite . to be concrete ,",
    "below we consider the process @xmath2 one of the feynman diagrams of this process which contains the abovementioned singularity ( the so ",
    "called @xmath3-channel singularity in the physical region ) is presented in the fig.1 .",
    "this diagram can be viewed as a sequence of two processes : @xmath4 and @xmath5 both of which can occur for the _ real _ muonic neutrino .",
    "therefore , there exists a region of the final phase space corresponding to the reaction ( [ 1 ] ) where denominator of the propagator of the muonic neutrino @xmath6 can be equal to zero . , [ 2.5 ] ) have a possibility to occur . ]    in the paper @xcite it has been shown that accounting for the finite sizes of the colliding beams gives a finite cross section for the processes with the @xmath3-channel singularity in the physical region .",
    "this result has been obtained on the base of the results of the paper @xcite where a general technique for taking into account the finite sizes of the colliding beams has been worked out ( for the review see @xcite ) . the effective cross section obtained in @xcite @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the number of events and",
    "@xmath9 is the luminosity of the @xmath10 collisions ) can be written in the form @xmath11 the cross section @xmath12 by definition corresponds to the wide region of the phase space defined by the inequality @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the muon mass .",
    "this part of the cross section can be calculated by means of the standard rules of the relativistic scattering theory . for the discussed process",
    "the result of this calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the cross section @xmath15 corresponds to the narrow region of the final phase space where @xmath16 which includes the point @xmath17 .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the main contribution to this cross section is given by the pole of the @xmath18 propagator and that this contribution is proportional to the transverse size of the colliding beams @xmath19 : @xmath20 it is _ the linear beam ",

    "such interpretation of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite leads , in particular , to a more clear understanding of its region of applicability .    in view of the realistic situation at future muon colliders",
    ", we assume that longitudinal @xmath21 and transverse @xmath19 sizes of the colliding beams satisfy the inequalities : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the muon life time in its rest frame , @xmath25 m. due to the condition ( [ 8 ] ) the number of muons can be thought to be a constant during the time which is required for the colliding beams to cross each other .",
    "note , that conditions ( [ 8])([9 ] ) are perfectly fulfilled for the projects of muon colliders which are discussed in the literature @xcite . using the beam parameters from ref . @xcite and",
    "the total energy @xmath26 gev one gets : @xmath27    subsequent part of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we give a simple qualitative description of the linear beam  size effect ; section 3 is devoted to the direct calculation of the number of events corresponding to the @xmath28 collisions ; in section 4 we transform the result derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath29 to the rest frame of the @xmath30 beam and compare it with the results of section 3 ; in section 5 we discuss a case when conditions ( [ 8])([9 ] ) are not satisfied ; our conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we consider a collision of a single muon @xmath31 with the beam of muons of the positive charge @xmath32 . in this analysis",
    "it is convenient to use the rest frame of the @xmath31 .",
    "being unstable , this muon is surrounded by a `` cloud '' of @xmath18 s which appear in the @xmath31 decay ( certainly , there are also @xmath33 and @xmath34 `` clouds '' , but they are not interesting for us at the moment ) .",
    "the density of neutrinos in this cloud decreases as @xmath35 with the growth of the distance @xmath36 from the @xmath31 , its time dependence corresponds to the exponential decay law and the angular distribution is isotropic .",
    "therefore , one finds @xmath37 this density is normalized by the condition @xmath38 which means that the total number of @xmath18 s which cross a sphere of radius @xmath36 is equal to unity .",
    "we shall see below that the main contribution to the @xmath39 comes from the distance @xmath40 .",
    "the typical time of collision is therefore @xmath41 .",
    "if the collision occurs at the time @xmath3 which satisfies the inequality @xmath42 , the neutrino density can be taken to be time independent in the collision region ( these assumptions are justified by the obtained result ) : @xmath43    the distribution of the neutrinos over impact parameters @xmath44 of the @xmath10 collisions - axis is antiparallel to the momentum @xmath45 of the @xmath32 . ]",
    "is given by @xmath46 we note that the main contribution to this integral is given by the longitudinal distances of the order of @xmath47 the number of muonic neutrinos which collide with the @xmath48 beam of the radius @xmath19 is therefore : @xmath49 the non  standard piece of the cross section of the process ( [ 1 ] ) is proportional to the number of neutrinos ( [ 14 ] ) and can be estimated as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 corresponds to the cross section of the process ( [ 2.5 ] ) averaged over effective @xmath18 spectrum .",
    "the estimate ( [ 15 ] ) corresponds to the @xmath29 obtained in @xcite .",

    "we perform it in the rest frame of the @xmath31 beam in which neutrino density @xmath52 has the simple form ( [ 12 ] ) . for simplicity , we neglect energy and angular spread of the particles in the muon beams .    the number of events for the @xmath53 process can be written in the form @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the spectral luminosity of @xmath28 collisions .",

    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the energy and the escape angles of @xmath18 , and @xmath61 is the energy of @xmath32 .    for unpolarized muons the energy distribution of the @xmath18 does not depend on the neutrino escape angles and has the well  known form @xcite @xmath62    let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be the particle densities of @xmath31 and @xmath32 beams respectively . in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) the density of the neutrinos in the point @xmath65 is defined by the muons @xmath30 decaying at the point @xmath66 by the following equation : @xmath67 therefore , the spectral luminosity of @xmath28 collisions is equal to ( see , for example , @xcite  12 ) @xmath68 where @xmath69    note that the vector @xmath70 is parallel to the neutrino momentum @xmath71 : @xmath72    in the next section we shall show that the result for @xmath73 obtained in @xcite completely coincides with eqs .",
    "( [ 16])([20 ] ) .",
    "in this section we follow the line of reasoning of ref . @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that we switch to the rest frame of the @xmath30 beam .",
    "it turns out that this reference frame is quite helpful for the physical interpretation of the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use the following notations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath75 is the square of the total energy in the center of mass frame , @xmath76 is the muon width , @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the 4-momentum of the final @xmath79 system , @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the momentum transfer in the @xmath3-channel and @xmath82 .",
    "the square of the momentum transfer in the @xmath3-channel is equal to @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the component of the momentum @xmath85 which is transverse to the momenta of the initial muons and @xmath86 is the maximal value of @xmath6 @xmath87 note , that @xmath88    as is explained in the introduction , usual approximations in the scattering theory ( based on the collisions of the plane waves ) result in the divergent cross section in this case .",
    "in contrast to this approximation , we use the formalism of the colliding wave packets ( beams of particles ) of macroscopic , but finite sizes which has been developed in ref . @xcite . in the overwhelming majority of experiments",
    "both descriptions provide the same result .",
    "however , in a number of cases the usual approximation is insufficient and consideration of the colliding wave packets is mandatory  see description of the experiments on a single bremsstrahlung at vepp-4 @xcite and at hera @xcite and the review @xcite .",
    "the same can be stated about discussed processes with the singularities caused by real particles in the intermediate states ( @xmath3channel singularities in the physical region ) .",
    "the breakdown of the standard calculations clearly indicates inapplicability of the standard approximations in the scattering theory for these cases .",
    "let us remind that in the standard approach the number of events @xmath8 is the product of the cross section @xmath89 and the luminosity @xmath9 : @xmath90 where @xmath91 for the head  on collision of the ultra ",
    "relativistic beams .",
    "the quantities @xmath92 are the particle densities of the beams .",
    "the transformation from the plane waves to the wave packets results in the following changes .",
    "the squared matrix element @xmath93 with the initial state in the form of the plane waves with the momenta @xmath94 and @xmath95 transforms to the product of the matrix elements @xmath96 and @xmath97 with different initial states : @xmath98 here the initial state @xmath99 is the direct product of the plane waves with the momenta @xmath100 and @xmath101 , while the initial state @xmath102 is the direct product of the plane waves with the momenta @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "instead of the luminosity @xmath9 the number of events starts to depend on the quantity @xmath105 through the following formula @xmath106 note that in this formula the densities @xmath107 and @xmath108 are taken in different points  it corresponds to the nonlocal interaction of colliding muons ( contrary , in eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) these densities are taken in one and the same point ) .",
    "the characteristic values of @xmath109 are of the order of the inverse beam sizes , i.e. @xmath110 usually this quantity is much smaller than the typical scale for the variation of the matrix element with respect to the initial momenta .",
    "this is the case for @xmath111 which is determined by the region of large values of @xmath112 .",
    "here we can put @xmath113 in @xmath114 which immediately results in the standard expression for the number of events ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "however , for the quantity @xmath74 determined by the region ( [ 5 ] ) , the variable @xmath6 can go through zero . therefore in this region @xmath6 changes considerably if initial momenta are varied on a quantity of the order of @xmath115 .",
    "consequently , transformations ( [ 26])([28 ] ) reduce to the following modification : @xmath116 where @xmath117 let us expand @xmath3 and @xmath118 up to the terms linear in @xmath119 .",
    "this gives @xmath120 where @xmath121    as the result , the divergent quantity @xmath122 transforms to @xmath123~[q^2 + \\lambda ( q^2 ) -i\\epsilon]}. \\label { 33}\\ ] ] as has been shown in @xcite the main contribution to the integral over @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ 33 ] ) is given by the pole @xmath124 in the upper half plane .    in the rest frame of the @xmath30 ,",
    "the vector @xmath125 is equal to @xmath126 where @xmath59 is the energy of the real ( @xmath17 ) neutrino and @xmath127 is the unit vector which defines direction of motion of the neutrino .",
    "taking this pole and performing subsequent integrations over @xmath119 and @xmath128 , we obtain @xmath129    as a result , @xmath130 for unpolarized muon beams @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the azimuthal angle of the vector @xmath133 .    in the rest frame of the @xmath30 we have @xmath134 here",
    "@xmath135 is the angle between momentum @xmath71 of the muonic neutrino and the momentum @xmath45 of the positively charged muon .    using these equations",
    "we express differential width of the @xmath30 as @xmath136 now adding all pieces together and using ( see also eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) ) @xmath137 we finally get the following expression @xmath138 @xmath139 it is easy to see that after redefinition @xmath140 expression ( [ 38 ] ) completely coincides with eqs .",
    "( [ 16])([20 ] ) .",
    "what happens if conditions ( [ 8])-([9 ] ) are not satisfied ? though this question is purely academic one for muon colliders , it can have a certain principal interest .",
    "there is no general answer in this situation and every such case should be considered separately . in this situation",
    "the method of preparation of colliding beams as well as decrease in the numbers of muons and neutrinos during the collision are of great importance",
    ". the true consideration in this case would require the modelling of how really unstable particle travels in the collider  it is clear that some characteristics of the collider are likely to enter the final result at this point .",
    "in this section we consider a particular case related to the paper @xcite . in this paper",
    "the divergent cross section of the process ( [ 1 ] ) has been regularized by introducing a complex mass for initial unstable particles : @xmath141 solving the energy ",
    "momentum conservation conditions it is possible to show then that the square of the momentum transfer in the @xmath3-channel gets small imaginary part : @xmath142 therefore , the singularity is regularized and the calculation of the cross section starts to be possible .",
    "below we explain the physical meaning of the result obtained in this way in ref . @xcite .. ]    let us assume that @xmath31 beam has been prepared much earlier than the collision takes place .",
    "this means that almost all muons have managed to decay . in this case",
    "every @xmath31 produces a single @xmath18 with definite distribution over the energy ( [ 17 ] ) and with the isotropic angular distribution in the rest frame of the @xmath31 . to obtain the results of ref .",
    "@xcite we also have to assume that the @xmath32 beam is so large that all neutrinos produced in the @xmath30 decay are still inside this beam having a possibility to collide with the muons of the positive charge .",
    "this situation is similar to the fast decay of the @xmath30 in a medium of the muons of the positive charge .",
    "in such situation the number of events is defined by the cross section @xmath143 which corresponds to the cross section of the process ( [ 2.5 ] ) averaged over the spectrum of neutrinos and their escape angles : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is defined in ( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "( [ 37 ] ) and integrating over @xmath146 and @xmath132 we obtain @xmath147 this result is identical to the one which has been presented in ref . @xcite",
    "\\1 . comparing the results of sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "we conclude that _ the linear beam  size effect obtained in _ @xcite _ corresponds to the scattering of the @xmath32 beam on the `` cloud '' of real neutrinos @xmath18 produced in the @xmath148 decay_. such interpretation assumes that the colliding beams have finite sizes and that decays of the negative muons on their way to the interaction point produce a @xmath18 cloud which fills the region occupied by @xmath32 beam .",
    "really amazing is the fact that within perturbative calculations these effects can be found only if one considers a collision of two wave packets which correspond to the beams of the colliding particles .",
    "standard approximations in the scattering theory do not work in this case .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the `` formation length '' @xmath149 of this @xmath150 cloud . in the center of mass frame",
    "the angular spread of the muonic neutrinos @xmath151 is of the order of @xmath152 .",
    "hence one obtains @xmath153 for the discussed parameters of the beams @xcite and the total energy @xmath154 gev one finds @xmath155 cm .    from this",
    "we obtain the number of the neutrinos @xmath18 which participate in the collision .",
    "it can be estimated as @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",
    "this number shows the level of statistical fluctuations which one expects for the @xmath158 collisions .",
    "it is interesting to compare the process ( [ 1 ] ) which has been discussed in this paper and the processes with large impact parameters considered in the review @xcite , for example , the process @xmath159 it is not difficult to show that the impact parameters @xmath44 , which give essential contribution to the cross section of the process ( [ 43 ] ) in the standard calculations , are of the order of @xmath160 note that the quantity @xmath161 can be macroscopically large : for instance , for the collider hera @xmath162 cm already for @xmath163 gev . in this case there is a cloud of equivalent photons ( ep ) around every proton , these ep scatter on the electrons of the opposite beam . as a result ,",
    "the interaction of electrons with protons becomes _ macroscopically _ nonlocal . in the discussed process ( [ 1 ] ) similar macroscopically nonlocal interaction between @xmath32 and @xmath31 is due to the cloud of real @xmath18 s which appears as a result of the muon decay .",
    "certainly , the nature of these clouds is quite different , however , one can describe both processes by means of the same technique .",
    "distributions of ep and @xmath18 s in @xmath44 are absolutely different for both of these processes . the @xmath18 cloud in the process ( [ 1 ] ) is distributed in the impact parameter space according to eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , i.e. @xmath164 this distribution leads ( after integration over @xmath44 in the beam region , @xmath165 ) to the linear beam  size effect : @xmath166 the distribution of ep has another form @xmath167 from which the known logarithmic beam  size effect immediately follows : @xmath168 let us emphasize that the logarithmic beam ",
    "size effect has been already established in experiments @xcite .",
    "let us finally compare the contribution of real and virtual @xmath18 s to the total cross section .",
    "first , we remind that because of the fixing of the region of the final phase space , the cross section @xmath169 ( see eq . ( [ 4 ] ) and the discussion after it ) is completely determined by virtual @xmath18 s with @xmath13 .",
    "contrary , the contribution of real @xmath18 s in the intermediate state absolutely dominates in @xmath29  the relative contribution of virtual neutrinos to this piece of the cross section can be estimated as @xmath170 .",
    "let us stress , however , that the approach described in @xcite allows to calculate the contribution of virtual neutrinos to @xmath171 as well as the contribution which appears due to the interference of real and virtual neutrinos .",
