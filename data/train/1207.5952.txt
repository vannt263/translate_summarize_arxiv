    "understanding quantum transport in simple systems is of obvious relevance for understanding nano and mesoscopic devices as well as transport in real materials .",
    "one such model system is a tight - binding chain in the presence of disorder and dephasing , that has been studied already more than 30 years ago  @xcite .",
    "the goal is to understand the interplay of disorder , incoherent processes and possibly interactions , on the transport properties .",
    "if the system is coherent procedure is , at least in principle , straightforward ",
    "one has to calculate the transmission by one of various approaches , see e.g. book  @xcite for an overview .",
    "non - coherent processes due to interaction with external degrees of freedom , for instance due to electron - phonon scattering , are more difficult to account for .",
    "correspondingly , they are also less understood . in the present work we study the influence of the environment , in particular its dephasing effects , on the bulk quantum transport in a disordered system .",
    "there are several approaches how to study incoherent transport .",
    "a rigorous one in terms of nonequilibrium green s function is difficult to analytically evaluate for all but the simplest systems , while its numerical calculation is very time - consuming and limited to small systems . with that in mind ,",
    "alternative , more phenomenological approaches to incoherent transport are actively investigated .",
    "one of the earliest suggestions accounts for the dephasing by introducing fictitious reservoirs that break phase coherence  @xcite .",
    "this so - called b \" uttiker probe has been applied to the disordered tight - binding model  @xcite and is successfully used for the calculation of transmission through molecules , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . a phenomenological model of dephasing can also be constructed by using an appropriate self - energy in a nonequilibrium green s function  @xcite .",
    "another approach consists of treating the system as being composed of statistically distributed coherent and incoherent parts ( having an imaginary self - energy )  @xcite .",
    "dephasing can also be accounted for by simulating vibrational motion of individual sites  @xcite , thereby modulating inter - site couplings , as is for instance done using molecular dynamics simulations in carbon nanotubes  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use different approach by writing quantum master equation of the lindblad type  @xcite describing time evolution of the reduced density matrix of a tight - binding model without environment .",
    "environmental dephasing is described in an effective way by dissipative operators that cause the decay of off - diagonal coherences ( i.e. , also of the current ) .",
    "coupling the system in addition to reservoirs a true nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) , reached after long time , is studied .",
    "description with the lindblad equation has its advantages and disadvantages .",
    "compared to other approaches , once one finds the ness one has access to all many - body observables , i.e. to a complete state .",
    "of course , this advantage can be harnessed only if one is able to solve for the ness .",
    "fortunately , a tight - binding model with dephasing is solvable  @xcite in its lindblad formulation . while a study of nesss of lindblad equations is a well - defined and important mathematical problem it has its down sides also . a number of approximations , like weak coupling and fast - decaying bath correlations , is needed in standard derivations of the lindblad equation  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that lindblad master equation is expected to provide good description on timescales that are much larger than the timescale of bath correlations .",
    "it namely provides the most general description for quantum processes that preserve positivity and trace and form a dynamical semigroup .",
    "memory effects , not accounted for by the lindblad equation , are expected to be smaller at higher temperatures , which is the regime that we study .",
    "in addition , we are interested in the bulk transport properties in the thermodynamic limit for which finite - size boundary effects are expected to play no role . compared to small systems , where more complicated master equations might be necessary for the correct description of transport ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , we can use simpler lindblad equation to calculate bulk conductivity at high temperature .    tight - binding model with dephasing and disorder has recently become of interest also in the context of excitation transfer in biomolecules , in particular in photosynthetic complexes .",
    "there a coupling with the environment , i.e. , dephasing , increases the efficiency of excitation transfer because it counteracts localization due to disorder  @xcite .",
    "this , so - called environmentally assisted transport , can be in long homogeneous chains explained by analytical results that we present .",
    "our study proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , using the method introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and extending it to an inhomogeneous system , we transform the problem from the state space of many - body density matrices , that is exponentially large in the chain length , to the one of two - point correlation functions , whose size is only quadratic in the chain length .",
    "we manage to analytically solve the resulting equations for some parameter regimes , while for other we resort to numerical solution .",
    "in addition to explaining the dependence of conductivity , i.e. , of diffusion constant , on disorder and dephasing strength we also identify an interesting resonance phenomenon for periodically placed disorder .",
    "we shall first present the model in the framework of pauli matrices and show later a well - known fact that the model is equivalent to a nonequilibrium tight - binding model with an on - site disorder and experiencing dephasing due to environment .",
    "the hamiltonian of the xx spin chain in an inhomogeneous magnetic field is given by @xmath0 with standard pauli matrices and @xmath1 being the chain length .",
    "we use units in which @xmath2 and nearest - neighbor hopping is @xmath3 .",
    "we shall describe evolution of the system , described by a many - body density matrix @xmath4 of size @xmath5 , in the presence of environment by lindblad equation  @xcite , @xmath6 + { \\cal l}^{\\rm dis}(\\rho)\\equiv{\\cal l}(\\rho ) , \\label{eq : lin}\\ ] ] in which dissipative influence of the environment is described by the so - called dissipator @xmath7 .",
    "action of a dissipator on an arbitrary operator @xmath4 is expressed in terms of lindblad operators @xmath8 as , @xmath9 + [ l_k,\\rho l_k^{\\dagger } ] \\right).\\ ] ] dissipator will in our case consist of two parts , @xmath10 .",
    "the first @xmath11 describes the action of two baths , one at each chain end , and will induce a nonequilibrium situation with current flowing through the system .",
    "the bath is written as a sum of a part acting only at the left end ( site index @xmath12 and label `` l '' ) and a part acting only at the right end ( site index @xmath13 and label `` r '' ) , @xmath14 .",
    "two lindblad operators at the left end are @xmath15 while at the right end we have @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "bath therefore flips the boundary spin up or down with certain probability .",
    "parameter @xmath18 plays the role of the forcing , trying to induce magnetization @xmath19 at the left end and @xmath20 at the right end  @xcite .",
    "the other dissipative part , @xmath21 , represents the influence of environment at each site , being for instance due to scattering on phonons .",
    "the dephasing part @xmath22 is a sum of @xmath23 , each of which acts only at the @xmath24-th site and is described by a single lindblad operator , @xmath25 due to dissipation the system s density matrix @xmath26 will after long time converge to a time - independent state @xmath27 that is called a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) . for our model",
    "the ness @xmath28 is unique and can be formally expressed via the solution of lindblad equation ( [ eq : lin ] ) as @xmath29 . in this work",
    "we shall be interested in the nesss bulk transport properties in the presence of disorder and dephasing .",
    "conductivity is expected to be insensitive to details of bath lindblad operators in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "all expectation values reported in the paper are with respect to the ness state , e.g. @xmath30 .    because we are interested in transport properties the central object we shall consider is the spin ( i.e. , magnetization ) current @xmath31 , defined at site @xmath32 through a continuity relation , resulting in expression @xmath33 $ ] , giving @xmath34 dephasing alone causes an exponential decay of off - diagonal matrix elements ( in the standard basis in which @xmath35 is diagonal ) .",
    "therefore , due to @xmath36 , if there would be no @xmath37 and no @xmath11 in the lindblad equation , dephasing would cause an exponential decay of current with time , @xmath38 . in the presence of hamiltonian and driving",
    "the evolution is more complicated , resulting in a nontrivial ness . evaluating the action ( [ eq : lin ] ) of dephasing ( [ eq : ldeph ] ) on the identity and @xmath35 operators",
    ", we see that @xmath39 hold .",
    "to find the ness @xmath28 we have to find stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) , i.e. , solve @xmath40 .",
    "expanding @xmath28 in an operator basis the stationary equation can be written as a set of coupled linear equations for unknown expansion coefficients .",
    "because the number of unknown coefficients is @xmath41 , and therefore grows exponentially with the system size @xmath1 , it is for a generic system impossible to analytically obtain @xmath28 .",
    "xx model with dephasing though has a nice property that these exponentially many equations split into smaller sets of equations that are uncoupled  @xcite .",
    "namely , there is a hierarchy of observables according to the number of fermionic operators they contain .",
    "for instance , all two - point observables decouple from the rest , meaning that one can write a closed set of equations for observables involving two fermionic operators .",
    "once these are known , they can be used as a `` source '' term in equations for three - point observables , and so on for higher order correlations . for general consideration when such a hierarchy appears see ref .",
    "@xcite .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one consequence of such structure is that the ness can be written as @xmath42 \\nonumber \\\\ h & = & \\sum_{r=1}^{l}\\sum_{j=1}^{l+1-r } h_j^{(r ) } h^{(r)}_j \\nonumber \\\\ b & = & \\sum_{r=2}^{l}\\sum_{j=1}^{l+1-r } b_j^{(r ) } b^{(r)}_j , \\label{eq : ansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath43 and @xmath44 , both for @xmath45 and with @xmath46 being a string of @xmath32 consecutive @xmath35 s .",
    "@xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 .",
    "let us stress that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) is not just a perturbative expansion in @xmath18 as it might seem at a first glance  it is an exact ansatz  @xcite holding for any driving @xmath18 . or , in other words , terms proportional to @xmath49 ( and of higher order ) not written explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) are all orthogonal ( using hilbert - schmidt inner product @xmath50 ) to operators in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "writing now @xmath40 using the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , we get the aforementioned closed set of linear equations for unknown coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "there are @xmath62 equations for exactly as many unknown coefficients .",
    "solving eqs.([eq : eqs ] ) therefore gives exact expectation values of observables @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "we see that the conductivity is finite and nonzero , i.e. , we have a diffusive transport , provided the current scales as @xmath94 .",
    "let us finally briefly discuss the energy range to which the studied ness states correspond .",
    "we prefer to use energy instead of temperature because thermalization in integrable systems , of which the xx chain is an instance , can depend on the choice of lindblad reservoirs  @xcite .",
