    "deep colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) from images taken with the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) and the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) revealed that several intermediate - age ( @xmath0 12 gyr ) star clusters in the magellanic clouds host extended main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) regions @xcite , in some cases accompanied by composite red clumps @xcite .",
    "the presence of these extended mstos ( hereafter emstos ) has been interpreted as due to stars that formed at different times within the parent cluster , with age spreads of 150500 myr @xcite .",
    "if so , these objects might be the younger counterparts of the old galactic globular clusters with multiple stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative scenario to explain the emsto phenomenon was originally proposed by @xcite , who suggested that this is due to the presence of a spread in rotation velocity among turn - off stars ( for a detailed discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "finally , @xcite suggested that the emstos and the dual clumps can be photometric features produced by merged binary systems and interacting binaries with mass transfer .",
    "recently , emstos have been detected also in young ( @xmath0 100300 myr ) massive star clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . in particular , @xcite and (",
    "* hereafter c15 ) discovered the presence of an emsto in the star cluster ngc1856 , consistent with the presence of an age spread of @xmath0 80 myr .",
    "interestingly , the cmd of ngc1856 also shows a split in the ms @xcite , which has been interpreted as an indication that the cluster might host two coeval stellar populations with different rotational velocities @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the cmd of the young ( @xmath0 100 myr ) star cluster ngc1755 shows a similar morphology , including an emsto and a ms split .",
    "they demonstrated that the bimodal ms is well reproduced by a single stellar population with different rotation velocities , whereas the fit between the observed emsto and models with different rotation is not fully satisfactory . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed that the @xmath0 300 myr cluster ngc1844 presents only a split in the ms and not an emsto .",
    "it is evident that these new discoveries in young clusters give us a new opportunity to study the nature of the emsto phenomenon and to provide additional constraints to discriminate among the different scenarios .        in this context , another interesting object is the young ( @xmath0 100 myr ) star cluster ngc1850 in the lmc .",
    "@xcite used _ hst _",
    "wfc3 observations with the _ f336w _ and _ f438w _ filters to show that the cluster hosts an emsto which can be reproduced by an age spread of @xmath0 40 myr . however , they suggest that this is the age range expected when the effect of rotation in msto stars is interpreted in terms of an age spread , and thus concluded that no age spread is present in the cluster .",
    "they also suggest that the presence of an age spread should cause a `` bimodal '' distribution in the msto region , whereas the observed distribution can be approximated by a single ( possibly skewed ) gaussian distribution .    here , we present an analysis of new _ hst _",
    "wfc3 photometry of ngc1850 , exploiting a different set of filters with respect to that used by @xcite . our data , thanks to a significantly larger colour baseline , allow us to study thoroughly the cmd morphology and to perform a detailed analysis of the msto region .",
    "we compare the cluster cmd with theoretical models , using isochrones with different ages and different rotation rates and with monte carlo simulations in order to quantify to what extent the cmd can be reproduced by a simple stellar population ( ssp ) with a distribution of rotation rates .",
    "we derive the cluster mass and escape velocity to test whether the cluster has ( or has had ) the right properties to retain mass - loss material that can be ( or could have been ) used to form a second generation of stars .",
    "this study allows us to have a clearer picture of the cluster s star formation history and in particular on the nature of the observed emsto region .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : observations and data reduction are presented in section2 . in section3 , we discuss the observed cmd , whereas in section4 we compare the observed cmd with theoretical models , using isochrones with different ages and different rotation rates . in section5",
    ", we compare the observed cmd with monte carlo simulations , both using one ssp with different rotation rates and a combination of four ssps with different ages and different rotation rates ; we obtain the pseudo - colour distributions for the observed and simulated cmds and compare them . in section6 , we present the analysis of narrow - band h@xmath1 imaging . in section7 , we investigate how the cmd morphology changes as a function of the distance from the cluster center , while the physical and dynamical properties of the cluster are presented in section8 .",
    "finally , in section9 , we discuss our results and their implications on the interpretation of the emsto phenomenon .",
    "ngc1850 was observed with _ hst _ on 2015 october 22 using the uvis channel of the wfc3 as part of the _ hst _ program 14174 ( pi : p. goudfrooij ) .",
    "the cluster was centered on one of the two ccd chips of the wfc3/uvis camera , to avoid the loss of its central region due to the ccd chip gap and to minimize the impact of different photometric zeropoints for the two chips .",
    "the cluster was observed using three filters , namely _",
    "f275w _ , _ f656n _ , and _ f814w_. two long exposures were taken in the _ f275w _ and _ f814w _ filters , and three in the _ f656n",
    "the total exposure times for each filter are 1570 s ( _ f275w _ ) , 2875 s ( _ f656n _ ) , and 790 s ( _ f814w _ ) . in addition , we took two short exposures in the _ f275w _ and _ f814w _ filters ( 150 s and 10 s , respectively ) , to avoid saturation of the brightest stars .",
    "the two or three long exposures were spatially offset from each other by 018 and -2401 in a direction + 8576 with respect to the positive x- and y - axis of the detector .",
    "this was done to move across the gap between the two wfc3/uvis ccd chips , as well to simplify the identification and removal of hot pixels . to investigate the h@xmath1-emitting stars in the cluster",
    ", we complemented our dataset with archival observations with the filter _",
    "( go-11925 , pi : s. e. deustua ) . the main purpose of this filter in this context is to define the continuum level at the wavelength of h@xmath1 along with the _ f814w _ filter .",
    "program go-11925 is a calibration program to test the linearity of wfc3/uvis , hence images in this filter were taken with various exposure times ; for our purpose , only the two long exposures were useful ( 300 s and 500 s , respectively ) .",
    "in addition to the wfc3/uvis observations , we used the wide field camera ( wfc ) of acs in parallel to obtain images @xmath0 6from the cluster center using the _ f555w _ , _ f658n _ , and _",
    "f814w _ filters .",
    "these observations provide a clean picture of the stellar content , star formation history , and h@xmath1-emitting stars in the underlying lmc field .    to reduce the images , we use the following method . briefly , we start from the _ flt _ files provided by the _ hst _ pipeline , which constitute the bias - corrected , dark - subtracted , and flat - fielded images .",
    "the _ flt _",
    "files are first corrected for charge transfer inefficiency effects using the dedicated cte correction software .",
    "star positions and fluxes are measured on the cte - corrected _ flc _ files using the publicly - available fortran program _",
    "img2xym_wfc3uv _ with the available library of spatially variable point - spread functions ( psfs , in an array of @xmath2 psfs ) for each filter .",
    "we derive an additional @xmath3 array of perturbation psfs for each exposure , to account for telescope breathing effects @xcite , and we combine it with the library psfs to fit stellar profiles .",
    "stellar positions are corrected for geometric distortion using the solution provided by @xcite .",
    "then , we create a master - frame list using one of the _ f814w _ exposures and we transform and average the exposures for the other filters into the reference system defined by the master frame by means of a six - parameter linear transformation . to obtain the final catalog we use the fortran software package ks2 ( j.  anderson , in preparation ) .",
    "this program allows us to find and measure stars in all the individual exposures simultaneously and in particular to measure faint objects that can not be detected in individual exposures .",
    "photometry of saturated stars is measured following the method developed by @xcite for the acs camera and subsequently demonstrated to be valid also for the wfc3/uvis detector @xcite , which allows one to recover the electrons that have bled into neighbouring pixels .    to obtain the photometric calibration",
    ", we compare psf - based instrumental magnitudes measured on the _ flc _ exposures with aperture - photometry magnitudes measured on the _ drc _ exposures ( i.e. , the distortion - corrected and resampled _ flc _ files ) using a fixed aperture of 10 pixels .",
    "we then transform the magnitudes into the vegamag system by adopting the relevant synthetic zero - points . finally ,",
    "for our analysis we select only those sources that are recovered in both exposures for the filters _",
    "f275w _ , _ f467 m _ , and _ f814w _ , and in two out of three exposures for the filter _",
    "f656n _ , and we clean the obtained catalog using the quality - of - fit ( qfit ) parameter , provided by ks2 , which identifies how well a source has been fit with the psf model @xcite .",
    "completeness as well as the photometric - error distribution of the final photometry are characterized by performing artificial star tests .",
    "we use the standard technique of adding artificial stars to the images and running them through the photometric routines applied in the reduction process . the method adopted to perform the artificial star tests",
    "is described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we generate a list of @xmath4 artificial stars and we distribute them in magnitude in order to reproduce a luminosity function similar to the observed one and with a colour distribution that span the full colour ranges found in the cmds .",
    "the overall distribution of the inserted artificial stars follows that of the stars in the image .",
    "each star in the list is inserted one at a time in the images with the appropriate flux and position and it is measured using the same procedure and psf adopted for real stars .",
    "we consider the inserted stars recovered if the input and output magnitudes agree to within 0.75 mag in every filter and if the input and output position agree to within 0.5 pixel .",
    "finally , a completeness fraction is assigned to each individual star in a given cmd as a function of its magnitude and distance from the cluster center .",
    "the left panel of fig.[f : fov ] shows a trichromatic stacked image of the wfc3/uvis field of view ( red channel : _",
    "f814w _ filter ; green channel : _",
    "f656n _ filter ; blue channel : _",
    "f275w _ filter ) . the white circle has a radius of @xmath5 20  which corresponds to the effective radius @xmath6 of the cluster , as derived in sect.[s : king ] . on the left side of ngc1850 ,",
    "the much younger cluster ngc1850b is clearly visible .",
    "the stacked image nicely outlines the gas filaments which cover a large portion of the uvis field of view .",
    "however , as derived in sect.[s : reddening ] , these filaments seem to lie behind the cluster and therefore do not affect our analysis . in the following , we define the region enclosed within a radius of @xmath7 as `` the cluster field '' . in order to minimize the contamination from the stars belonging to ngc1850b , we excluded from the final `` ngc1850 field '' catalog objects in the annular segment in the direction of ngc1850b ( i.e. , the stars that have a position angle between 138  and 217  in the detector frame and for which the distance from the cluster center is larger than @xmath6 ) . in the right panel of fig.[f",
    ": fov ] , we show the spatial positions of the selected stars in the field of view . the objects that satisfy the aforementioned criteria and represent the ngc1850 cluster field are reported as red dots .",
    "fig.[f : cmdobs ] shows the _ f814w _ vs.  _ f275w  f814w _ cmd of the ngc1850 field , derived as described in sect.[s : data ] and reported in the right panel of fig.[f : fov ] .",
    "the observed cmd presents two interesting features : ( 1 ) a msto region that is wider than what is expected from a single stellar population and ( 2 ) the presence of two mses : a blue and poorly - populated ms , and a red ms , which contains the majority of the stars . the two sequences run parallel from _ f814w",
    "_ @xmath0 18.5 mag to _ f814w _ @xmath0 21.25 mag , where they seem to merge together .",
    "the presence of a small colour difference between the two sequences at fainter luminosity , not detectable due to photometric errors , can however not be excluded .",
    "we calculate the ratio of stars in the blue and the red mses by carefully selecting stars in the two mses in a fixed magnitude interval ( 19.5 mag @xmath8 _ f814w _ @xmath8 21.0 ) .",
    "we derive that the less - populated blue ms contains around 25% of stars , with the remaining 75% belonging to the red ms ( see sect.[s : radial ] for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "this ratio is very similar to the one found by @xcite for ngc1755 .    to verify that the observed broadening of the msto and the double ms are `` real '' features in the cluster cmd , we checked for the following potential causes : contamination by field stars , photometric errors , and differential reddening .",
    "we assess the level of contamination by the field population by selecting a region near the top - right corner of the image which has the same surface area as the cluster field .",
    "the stars in this region are shown in fig.[f : cmdobs ] as red open squares .",
    "note that these stars mainly contaminate the lower ms , at fainter magnitudes than the observed splitting , and they do not affect the msto at all .",
    "we therefore conclude that field stars are not the cause of the observed split in the ms and the broadening in the msto region .     and shown in the right panel of fig.[f : fov ] .",
    "we determine the contamination from the underlying lmc field population from a region , with the same surface area adopted for the cluster star , near the top - right corner of the image .",
    "stars located in this region are superposed on the cluster cmd ( red squares ) .",
    "magnitude and colour errors are shown in the left side of the cmd .",
    "the reddening vector is also shown for @xmath9 . ]",
    "photometric uncertainties are derived during the reduction process .",
    "magnitude and colour errors are shown in the left panel of fig.[f : cmdobs ] ; photometric errors at the msto level are @xmath10 0.005 mag , whereas they are of the order of 0.015 mag at a magnitude _ f814w _ @xmath0 21.5 mag , where the mses are clearly separated .",
    "these errors are far too small to account for the observed broadening of the msto .",
    "to check whether differential reddening is present in our wfc3/uvis field of view and , in particular , in the cluster region , we adopt the same approach as in @xcite and described in detail in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we first rotate the cmd to a photometric reference frame in which the x - axis is parallel to the reddening line .",
    "this reference system makes it easier to estimate reddening differences than in the original colour - magnitude plane , where the reddening vector is inclined .",
    "then , we generate a fiducial line along the most - populated red ms and , among the stars in the red ms , we select a sample of reference stars with high - precision photometry . for each star in the field of view",
    ", we select a sample of 50 neighbour reference stars and we calculate the residual colours with respect to the fiducial line .",
    "the median of these residuals , calculated along the reddening direction , is assumed as the differential reddening corresponding to each star .",
    "each reference star is excluded in the computation of its own differential reddening .",
    "the results of the differential reddening correction are shown in fig.[f : redmap ] , where we compare a zoom - in portion of the ms for the original cmd ( left panel ) of ngc1850 and the cmd corrected for differential reddening ( middle panel ) .",
    "the two cmds are almost identical , suggesting that the impact of differential reddening is negligible and that the ms split is real .",
    "as a further proof , we show in the right panel of fig.[f : redmap ] the spatial distribution of the differential reddening in our field of view .",
    "each star is reported with a different colour , depending on the final @xmath11 that we applied . in order to better visualize how the differential reddening impacts the area of the cluster field",
    ", we report in fig.[f : redmap ] a circular region , with a radius @xmath12 .",
    "fig.[f : redmap ] clearly shows that the reddening variations in the ngc1850 field are very small , of the order of @xmath13 mag in @xmath14 .",
    "the technique that we applied is able to minimize the amount of differential reddening in the foreground of the cluster .",
    "we find a very small reddening variation across the field of view , and with a very specific spatial pattern that is completely uncorrelated to the h@xmath1 filaments we see in fig.[f : fov ] .",
    "this implies that these filaments are located behind the cluster .",
    "finally , since the reddening variation is negligible , we use the original photometry in the analysis for simplicity .",
    "to understand the nature of the double ms and extended msto in ngc1850 , we compare the cmd with model isochrones .",
    "we investigate the possibility that these features are caused by the two main scenarios presented in the literature : the presence of an age spread in the cluster or of a range of rotation velocities among the cluster stars .",
    "isochrone fitting is performed following the method described in detail in @xcite , and adopted also in c15 , for the case of star clusters that do not yet have a developed rgb .    in the following sections , we show the results of the isochrone fitting for the two aforementioned scenarios .      to test whether an age spread can reproduce the observed cmd morphology , we superpose two isochrones from parsec @xcite of different age ( @xmath0 90 myr and @xmath0 60 myr ) on the _ f814w _ vs.  _ f275w",
    " f814w _ cmd shown in the left panel of fig.[f : cmdage1 ] ( red and blue lines , respectively ) .",
    "the age of the isochrones are chosen to match the maximum and minimum age that can be accounted for by the position and width of the msto .",
    "note ( a ) that the morphology of the msto is not very well reproduced by a ssp and that an age spread of the order of 30 myr may constitute a better fit to the data in this region of the cmd and ( b ) that the observed double ms can not be reproduced at all using a combination of different ages .",
    "interestingly , we note that if we adopt the same parameters in terms of age , metallicity , distance , and reddening and we superpose the isochrones in the _",
    "f467 m _ vs.   _ f467m  f814w _ cmd ( shown in the right panel of fig.[f : cmdage1 ] ) we see that the selected isochrones do not fit the cmd ms , the isochrones being too red with respect to the observed ms ( note that due to the shorter colour baseline , the split is not observable in this cmd ) .    to verify that this discrepancy is not due to systematic uncertainties in the isochrone colour transformations , we also perform the inverse approach .",
    "we use the _",
    "f467 m _ vs.  _ f467m  f814w _ cmd ( left panel of fig.[f : cmdage2 ] ) to derive the isochrone parameters and then we overplot them onto the _ f814w _ vs.  _ f275w  f814w _ cmd ( right panel of fig.[f : cmdage2 ] ) .",
    "the latter cmd shows that also in this case a combination of isochrones with different ages provides a satisfactory fit of the msto . and , importantly , _",
    "both isochrones match the less - populated blue ms of the cluster very well_. this is a clear indication that the red ms , containing the majority of stars , can not be reproduced using non - rotating isochrones with different ages and thus _ must be constituted by rotating stars_.     60 and @xmath0 90 myr , respectively ) that can be accounted for by the data are superposed on the cluster cmd , along with the derived metallicity , distance modulus @xmath15 and reddening @xmath14 .",

    "isochrones with the same parameters as in the left panel are overplotted on the cluster cmd . ]      as mentioned above , the alternative scenario proposed to explain the emsto phenomenon suggests that it is caused by a spread in rotation velocity among to stars . to test this scenario , we use the isochrones from the geneva syclist database @xcite for which different rotation rates are available .",
    "the left panel of fig.[f : cmdrot ] shows the _ f814w _ vs. cmd with superimposed the isochrones for different rotation rates . in detail",
    ", the red isochrone has no rotation , i.e. @xmath16 = 0.0 , where @xmath17 represents the critical ( break - up ) rotation rate , whereas isochrones with @xmath16 = 0.30 , 0.50 , 0.80 , 0.90 , and 0.95 are reported in magenta , yellow , green , cyan , and blue , respectively .",
    "the non - rotating isochrone has been extended to masses m @xmath8 1.7 m@xmath18 by using the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reported in the cmd as a red dashed line ) . due to slightly different input physics in the two models ,",
    "a small color mismatch is present between the two non - rotating isochrones . to account for it , we shifted the @xcite non - rotating isochrone toward the blue by 0.06 mag . rotating isochrones with m @xmath8 1.7 m@xmath18 are not ( yet ) available . the adopted age , distance modulus , and reddening are also reported in the left panel of fig.[f : cmdrot ] . for what concerns metallicity ,",
    "only three options are provided by the geneva database for the rotating isochrones and we choose the value most appropriate for our case ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) .    . in this case , best - fitting isochrones are derived from the _",
    "f467 m _ vs.  _ f467m  f814w _ cmd ( left panel ) . the adopted age , metallicity , distance , and reddening are also reported .",
    "isochrones with these values are superimposed on the _ f814w _ vs.  _ f275w  f814w _ cmd ( right panel ) . ]",
    "a combination of different rotation rates seems to reproduce the ms split and the distribution of stars in the blue loop quite well .",
    "in particular , fast - rotating stars ( @xmath16@xmath20 0.80 ) constitute the more populated red ms , whereas non - rotating / slow rotating stars ( @xmath16@xmath8 0.50 ) constitute the blue ms .",
    "the presence of a clear gap between the two mses and thus the absence of intermediate - velocity rotators ( 0.50 @xmath8@xmath16@xmath8 0.80 ) indicates that the distribution of rotation velocities is somewhat bimodal , rather than continuous .",
    "fig.[f : cmdrot ] also shows that the fit in the msto is not satisfactory .",
    "this can be better appreciated in the right panels of fig.[f : cmdrot ] , in which we show zoom - in views of the msto ( top panel ) and the ms in the surroundings of the split ( bottom panel ) . in particular , in the msto region ,",
    "while the `` spread '' in _ f814w _ magnitude is reproduced by a combination of isochrones of different rotation rates , the spread in _ colour _ is larger in the observed cmd with respect to the one produced by the isochrones .",
    "this is further addressed below .",
    "to further determine to what extent a range in rotation velocities can reproduce the observed cmd , and in particular the observed msto morphology , we conduct monte carlo simulations of synthetic clusters with a single age and different stellar rotation velocities ( the method adopted to produce these simulations is described in detail in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "briefly , we simulate a ssp with a given age and chemical composition populating the non - rotating and rotating isochrones .",
    "stars are randomly drawn using a salpeter mass function and normalized to the observed ( completeness - corrected ) number of stars . as a first guess",
    ", we arbitrarily populated the different isochrones , in terms of @xmath16 , such that the relative numbers of stars reflect the distribution of @xmath16  for a - type stars in the solar neighbourhood from @xcite .",
    "after inspection of the results , we modified the relative numbers of stars so as to better reproduce the observed cmd morphology , that is to match the observed ratio between the blue and the red ms ( i.e. , we increased the relative numbers of stars for the fast - rotating populations with @xmath16 @xmath21 0.80 ) .",
    "the adopted final values are the following : @xmath10 10% for @xmath16 = 0.00 , @xmath10 5% for @xmath16 = 0.30 , @xmath10 10% for @xmath16 = 0.50 , @xmath10 35% for @xmath16 = 0.80 , @xmath10 30% for @xmath16 = 0.90 , and @xmath10 10% for @xmath16 = 0.95 .",
    "a component of unresolved binary stars , derived from the same mass function , is added to a fraction of the sample stars .",
    "we use a flat distribution of primary - to - secondary mass ratios and we adopt a binary fraction of @xmath10 40% . for the purposes of this work , the results do not change significantly within @xmath22 20% of the binary fraction . finally , we add photometric errors with a distribution derived during the photometric reduction process .",
    "we also obtained syclist cluster simulations from their website for comparison purposes .",
    "simulations include gravity and limb darkening effects @xcite as well as a random distribution of inclination angles ( rotation velocity distribution from * ? ? ?",
    "we found that the msto morphologies of the two sets of simulations are fully consistent with one another ( see sect.[s : pseudo ] below and right panel of fig.[f : cmdsim1 ] ) .",
    "we derive four different sets of synthetic cmds , with the only difference being the adopted age .",
    "in particular , we simulate four ssps with log(age ) values of 7.95 , 8.00 , 8.05 , and 8.10 .            to compare in detail the observed msto region with the simulated ones , we create pseudo - colour distributions .",
    "briefly , we construct a parallelogram across the msto ( shown in the left panel of fig.[f : cmdsim1 ] ) and we select the stars within it . we define the distributions with the term `` pseudo - colour '' because it reflects the star distribution along the major axis of the parallelogram , rather than the _ f275w ",
    "f814w _ colour .",
    "then , we calculate the pseudo - colour distributions using the non - parametric epanechnikov - kernel density function @xcite .",
    "this is done to avoid possible biases that can arise if fixed bin widths are used .",
    "we apply the procedure to both the observed and the simulated cmd .",
    "the results obtained from the comparison of the observed and simulated pseudo - colour distributions are described in the following sections .",
    "the left panel of fig.[f : cmdsim1 ] compares the observed and simulated cmd , the latter obtained as described above , adopting a single ssp with an age of @xmath0 90 myr ( log(age ) = 7.95 ) and a distribution of rotation rates that fits the morphology of the ms split .",
    "as expected from the isochrone comparison described in the previous section , this simulation reproduces the ms split quite well .",
    "conversely , the msto region of the simulation does not reproduce the observed msto region well , the latter being wider than the former .",
    "this is highlighted in the right panel of fig.[f : cmdsim1 ] , in which we compare the observed and simulated pseudo - colour distributions . indeed , the observed distribution ( shown as a black line ) is wider than the simulated one ( red line ) ; in particular , while the distributions are similar in the left half ( i.e. , blue side ) of their respective profiles , the observed one extends towards a significantly redder colour than the simulated ones .",
    "the same results are obtained comparing the observed distribution with that obtained from the syclist simulation ( reported as a blue line in the right panel of fig.[f : cmdsim1 ] ) .",
    "hence , fig.[f : cmdsim1 ] suggests that the inclusion of gravity and limb darkening effects , as well as the inclusion of a random viewing angle , can not account for the observed msto morphology , since the width and shape of the two simulated pseudo - colour distributions are almost identical .        to verify that the obtained results do not depend on the adopted age , in the top panels of fig.[f : cmdsim2 ] , we compare the observed cmd with the other three ssp simulations which have older ages .",
    "the comparison between the observed and simulated pseudo - colour distributions for these ssps is shown in the bottom panels .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that , as expected for older ages , the peak of the simulated distribution moves towards the right ( i.e. , towards redder colours ) , but , independently of the adopted age , the observed distribution is always wider than the simulated ones .",
    "thus , it seems that a range of rotation velocities , which can reproduce the ms split , can not explain the observed msto morphology .      in this context , we test the possibility that the emsto can be caused by a combination of the two effects , that is the presence of an age spread _ and _ a range of stellar rotation velocities for the cluster stars . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we derive the combined pseudo - colour distribution of the 4 ssps . at this stage",
    ", we are only interested in verifying whether the combination of a range of ssp ages provide a pseudo - colour distribution width that can match the observed one , and not in a detailed comparison of their global profiles .",
    "hence , we assume that the four ssps have the same number of stars in the cmd , without tailoring the relative weights based on the observed profile .",
    "the left panel of fig.[f : cmdsim3 ] shows the comparison between the observed and simulated cmd , whereas in the right panel we plot the corresponding pseudo - colour distributions .",
    "the right panel clearly shows that the two distributions are similar and that their widths are comparable ( see sect.[s : halpha ] below for a possible explanation of the discrepancy between the two distributions at the red end ) .",
    "it is also worth to note that the obtained distribution is not obviously bimodal and is well approximated by a single gaussian .",
    "this indicates that the profile of the distribution itself can not be used to exclude the presence of an age spread , in contradiction with the claims of @xcite .",
    "hence , the results presented in these sections show that a single ssp with different rotation rates fails in reproducing the observed pseudo - colour distribution of the msto whereas a combination of four ssps with different ages and different rotation rates can provide a better fit .",
    "this suggests that both effects are necessary to reproduce the observed msto region morphology .",
    "one of the original goals of this work was to determine whether ngc1850 hosts _ ongoing _ star formation .",
    "although the results from the analysis of the msto region presented in sect.[s : iso ] and [ s : mc_sim ] seem to exclude such presence , a definitive answer can be provided by performing a search for pre - main sequence stars exploiting narrow - band imaging of the h@xmath1   emission line .    to do this",

    "we suggest that this may be due to the presence of a dusty circumstellar disk that is oriented in a close to edge - on configuration , thus providing a `` local '' source of reddening that can not be corrected using the differential dereddening technique adopted in this work .    to test whether these objects may be responsible for the discrepancy between the observed pseudo - colour distribution and the simulated one ( cf .",
    "sect.[s : pseudo2 ] ) , we adopt the following empirical approach .",

    "we also show in fig.[f : psha ] the pseudo - colour distribution obtained from the combination of four simulated ssps ( represented by the red dashed line ) . in this case",
    ", the simulated distribution provides a good match to the observed one , better in fact than the original observed one that included the be stars ( cf .",
    "sect.[s : pseudo2 ] ) . however , we note that a small discrepancy still persists at the red end of the distribution",
    ". this seems to indicate that an even older population can be present in the cluster and that the derived age spread of @xmath0 35 myr can be considered as a lower limit .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the population of h@xmath1-emitting stars in the msto region can not account alone for the difference between the observed pseudo - colour distributions and those of the single - age simulations , confirming that rotation alone can not produce the observed morphology of the emsto .",

    "to investigate whether the population ratio between the two mses ( i.e. , between non - rotating or slow - rotating and fast - rotating stars ) changes as a function of cluster - centric radius we use the following method .",
    "first , we compute a fiducial line for the blue and red ms and we derive the verticalized cmd in such a way that the blue and the red fiducial translate into vertical line with abscissa 0 and 1 , respectively @xcite . to do this",

    "in particular , the lower magnitude limit has been chosen to exclude the faint part of the two mses , where they seem to merge together and thus the separation is not clear .",
    "finally , we derive the distribution of stars perpendicular to the ms in five cluster - centric annuli , chosen in such a way that they contain the same number of stars . in the inset of fig.[f : rad ] we show an example of the observed histogram distribution for the third radial interval .",
    "we applied a smoothed nave estimator @xcite to be insensitive to a particular binning starting point . to determine the fraction of blue ms stars with respect to the total number of stars in each region , we adopt a @xmath37 cut in the observed histogram distribution : stars with @xmath38 0.35 mag are associated to the blue ms , whereas stars with 0.35 @xmath39 1.5 mag are associated to the red ms (",
    "the two limits are reported in fig.[f : rad ] as dashed lines ) .",
    "the latter @xmath40 limit has been chosen to avoid the contamination from binary stars .    in fig.[f :",
    "rad ] , we show the fraction of blue ms stars with respect to the total number of ms stars as a function of the radial distance from the cluster center .",
    "fig.[f : rad ] shows that this ratio is constant with radius to within the poisson uncertainties . to test the robustness of this result",
    ", we also adopt a different method to derive the fraction of blue and red ms stars in the different cluster - centric annuli .",

    "]    taken these results at face value , it seems that the non - rotating / slow - rotating and fast - rotating stars share the same radial distribution .",
    "recently , similar studies have been carried out for other two young star clusters : @xcite studied ngc1856 and found similar results to ours for ngc1850 , that is the two populations share the same radial distribution , whereas in the cluster ngc1866 , @xcite did find a difference in the radial distribution , with the fraction of non - rotating / slow - rotating stars ( blue ms ) increasing slowly outward beyond its effective radius .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite determined the radial distribution of emsto stars in several intermediate - age ( 12 gyr ) massive star clusters .",
    "they find that , for the clusters with the highest escape velocities and longest relaxation times , the stars in the brightest half of the msto region are significantly more centrally concentrated than the stars in the faintest half .",
    "this has been interpreted in terms of an age spread ; the indication that the inner region of the cluster are preferentially populated by second - generation stars is in agreement with the prediction of the _ in situ _",
    "scenario @xcite .",
    "hence , if we assume that the results obtained here are valid also for intermediate - age star clusters ( i.e. , non - rotating and fast - rotating stars have the same radial distributions ) , it seems highly unlikely that the observed different central concentration can be explained in terms of a range of rotation velocities in the massive intermediate - age clusters .",
    "this suggests that the emsto phenomenon in intermediate - age star clusters may be due , at least in part , by a spread in age .",
    "unfortunately , a direct comparison with the radial distribution of msto stars in ngc1850 is hampered by the low number of objects in the cluster msto region .",
    "limits adopted to associate stars to the red and blue ms are reported as dashed lines . ]",
    "one of the important features of the emsto phenomenon in intermediate - age star clusters in the magellanic clouds is that they do not occur in _ all _ such clusters .",
    "a possible explanation of this in the context of multiple populations was provided by @xcite , who suggested that emsto are only hosted by clusters whose escape velocities were higher than the wind velocities of first - generation `` polluters '' stars that are thought to provide the seed material for secondary star formation , during the era when the cluster contained such stars ( this is referred to as the `` early escape velocity threshold '' scenario ) .",
    "the most popular types of such polluter stars are _",
    "( i ) _ agb stars with @xmath41 @xcite , _ ( ii ) _ massive rotating stars (  frms  , * ? ? ? * ) . and _ ( iii ) _ massive binary stars @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the studies of @xcite and @xcite suggested that the critical escape velocity for a star cluster to be able to retain the material ejected by first - generation polluter stars seem to be in the range of 1215 kms@xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the calculations of @xcite show that massive clusters should be able to sweep up significant fractions of their mass from the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) at young ages if their environment is sufficiently conducive . under the assumptions",
    "that ( 1 ) the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the lmc ( @xmath43 kms@xmath42 , @xcite ) is a typical relative velocity between a star cluster and the ambient ism in the lmc , and ( 2 ) a typical young cluster in the lmc has a half - mass radius of @xmath44 pc ( @xcite ; c15 ) , equations 58 of @xcite suggest that this can occur in the present - day lmc if the cluster is massive enough ( @xmath45 m@xmath18 ) and the local ism is dense enough but not so dense that it would strip any gas accreted by the cluster by ram pressure in its orbit ( 1 @xmath46 ( n/@xmath47 ) @xmath46 100 for a @xmath48 m@xmath18  cluster ) .    with this in mind ,",
    "we determine the structural and dynamical parameters of the cluster as described below .",
    "to determine the radial surface number density distribution of stars , we follow the procedure described by @xcite and adopted in c15 .",
