    "with this paper , we launch a project to classify integrable classes of surfaces .",
    "these are classes of surfaces whose gauss  mainardi  codazzi equations are integrable in the sense of soliton theory .",
    "our long - term goals include obtaining lists of integrable classes as complete as computing resources permit , clarifying their mutual relations , and identifying known subcases .",
    "our immediate goal is to demonstrate that the task is feasible and worth doing .",
    "the classical geometry of immersed surfaces in the euclidean space is well known to be closely connected with the modern theory of integrable systems  @xcite .",
    "the gauss ",
    "weingarten equations of a moving frame @xmath2 always take the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 are appropriate matrix functions .",
    "integrability conditions of   are called the gauss  mainardi  codazzi equations and take the form of a _ zero curvature representation _ @xmath5 = 0.\\ ] ] equation   is invariant under a huge group of _ gauge transformations _ @xmath6 induced by linear transformations @xmath7 of the frame . here",
    "@xmath8 is an invertible functional matrix , which can be restricted to take values in the lie group @xmath9 associated with the lie algebra @xmath10 matrices @xmath4 belong to  typically @xmath11 .",
    "the zero curvature representation   is the key ingredient in the soliton theory  @xcite , where matrices @xmath4 are additionally assumed to depend on what is called the _",
    "spectral parameter_. the essential requirement for solitonic integrability is that the spectral parameter can not be removed by means of the gauge transformation  .",
    "consequently , if the matrices @xmath4 can be modified so that they depend on a nonremovable parameter and still satisfy  , then the corresponding gauss  mainardi ",
    "codazzi equations are considered to be integrable in the sense of soliton theory , and their solutions are known as _",
    "integrable _ or _ soliton surfaces _  @xcite .",
    "solitonic integrability can appear only when surfaces are subject to a constraint ( such as being pseudospherical etc . ) . for numerous classical and recent examples",
    "see , e.g. , the references  @xcite ( or  @xcite in the projective setting ) .",
    "workable tools to classify such constraints include all the general integrability criteria  @xcite , which are , however , not immediately applicable to non - evolutionary systems  @xcite .",
    "other methods take advantage of the already known non - parametric zero curvature representation  , e.g. , the method of extended symmetries by cieliski et al .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we employ a recent method due to one of us  @xcite .",
    "its essence can be summarized as follows : we attempt to extend the given non - parametric zero curvature representation ( a seed ) to a power series in terms of the spectral parameter . in the work  @xcite , the relevant computable cohomological obstructions are identified .",
    "two obstacles make this procedure not entirely algorithmic : the parameter - dependent zero curvature representation can exist only in an extension of the lie algebra @xmath10 and its jet order ( the order of derivatives ) can exceed that of the seed . if no obstructions are found , various ways exist to incorporate the true nonremovable parameter .",
    "to be of genuine interest in geometry , the determining constraint on integrable surfaces must be invariant with respect to coordinate changes .",
    "the general non - differential invariant constraint is a functional relation @xmath12 between the principal curvatures @xmath13 .",
    "such a functional relation is characteristic of weingarten surfaces , which have been a topic of continuous interest , especially in global differential geometry  @xcite and computer graphics  @xcite .",
    "well known to be integrable is the class of _ linear weingarten surfaces _",
    "@xcite , characterized by a linear relation @xmath14 between the gauss curvature @xmath15 and the mean curvature @xmath16 ( not to be mixed with a linear relation between the principal curvatures  @xcite ) .",
    "other integrable classes of weingarten surfaces that sporadically occur in the literature all have a differential defining relation ( e.g. , the hazzidakis equation of the bonnet surfaces  @xcite ; a harmonicity condition of schief s  @xcite generalized linear weingarten surfaces ) or the class is not determined by the functional relation @xmath12 alone ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "so far , nothing contradicts the conjecture of finkel  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture  3.4 ) and wu  @xcite that the only functional relation @xmath12 to determine an integrable class of weingarten surfaces is the linear relation  .",
    "supporting arguments include wu s  @xcite proof of non - existence of an @xmath11-valued zero - curvature representation depending only on @xmath17-derivatives .",
    "finkel s",
    "@xcite argument roots in an unsuccessful search for higher - order symmetries and a ( disputable , see  @xcite ) conjecture that integrability implies the existence of a local higher - order symmetry ( actually the infinite hierarchy can be nonlocal , see also  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the main result of the present paper asserts that the simple relation @xmath18 between the main curvatures @xmath13 , determines an integrable class of weingarten surfaces .",
    "the associated nonlinear partial differential equation   has a parameter - dependent zero curvature representation   ( outside the class considered in  @xcite ) , a third - order symmetry   ( missed in  @xcite ) , and a recursion operator  .",
    "paradoxically enough , surfaces satisfying relation   were not unknown to nineteenth century geometers . in view of their knowledge ,",
    "our integrability result is not an entirely unexpected one .",
    "in fact , ribaucour  @xcite established that the corresponding focal surfaces ( evolutes ) have a constant gaussian curvature @xmath19 ( are pseudospherical ) .",
    "conversely , surfaces satisfying equation   are involutes of pseudospherical surfaces . moreover , the classical bianchi transformation  @xcite is nothing but the induced correspondence between the two focal pseudospherical surfaces .",
    "ribaucour s theorems are covered in darboux  @xcite and early twentieth - century monographs , such as  @xcite .",
    "later they became obsolete and forgotten as the induced bianchi relation between pseudospherical surfaces became superseded by the classical bcklund transformation ( the history is nicely reviewed by prus and sym in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect .  4 ) ) .",
    "the first examples of surfaces satisfying relation   also date to the nineteenth century .",
    "lipschitz  @xcite derived a four - parametric family in terms of elliptic integrals .",
    "a particular subcase , the rotation surface of von lilienthal  @xcite , is the involute surface of the pseudosphere .",
    "the left - hand side of equation   is equal to the difference of the principal radii of curvature at a point .",
    "this geometric quantity has a definite physical meaning , being associated with the _ interval of sturm _",
    "@xcite , also known as the _ astigmatic interval _ or the _ amplitude of astigmatism _ or simply the _ astigmatism _  @xcite . a mirror or a refracting surface satisfying relation   will feature a constant amplitude of astigmatism in the normal directions . in the sequel , surfaces satisfying condition   will be called _ surfaces of constant astigmatism . _",
    "accordingly , the equation   to determine the surfaces of constant astigmatism will be called the _ constant astigmatism equation_.",
    "we shall consider surfaces @xmath20 parametrized by curvature lines .",
    "as is well known , the fundamental forms can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath13 are the principal curvatures .",
    "coordinates @xmath22 are unique up to arbitrary changes @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the orthonormal frame , given by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 . the gauss ",
    "weingarten equations @xmath29 are easily established .",
    "their integrability conditions are the gauss equation @xmath30 and the mainardi ",
    "codazzi equations @xmath31 consequently , the two  @xmath11 matrices occurring in formulas   constitute a nonparametric zero curvature representation of the gauss  mainardi  codazzi system  ,  .",
    "because of the isomorphism @xmath32 , the same zero curvature representation can be alternatively written in terms of @xmath33 matrices @xmath34    let us impose a constraint  @xmath12 . if nontrivial , it can be resolved with respect to one of the curvatures , say @xmath35 which we assume henceforth .",
    "then the gauss  mainardi ",
    "codazzi system reduces substantially  @xcite . in particular , the mainardi ",
    "codazzi equations   have a general solution @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary nonconstant function , @xmath38 , and and @xmath39 are functions of @xmath17 and @xmath40 , respectively , removable by transformation @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we can put @xmath43 without loss of generality , i.e. , @xmath44 the gauss equation   then becomes @xmath45 summarizing , the gauss  mainardi ",
    "codazzi system of weingarten surfaces reduces to the single equation  .",
    "the classification problem considered in this paper is `` for which choices of the function @xmath46 is the equation   integrable ? ''    by substituting   into , we easily obtain a nonparametric zero curvature representation of equation  , @xmath47 which will be the starting point of the calculations to follow .",
    "readers not interested in details of the classification method can skip this section and continue to investigation of surfaces of constant astigmatism in section  [ z : sect ] .",
    "we use the formal theory of partial differential equations , which treats coordinates , unknown functions , and their derivatives as independent quantities .",
    "equations can be conveniently represented as submanifolds in appropriate jet spaces  @xcite .",
    "all our considerations being local , we let @xmath48 denote the space of @xmath49-jets of smooth functions @xmath50 .",
    "the base @xmath51 being equipped with coordinates @xmath22 , the natural coordinates along fibres of @xmath52 correspond to @xmath53 and its derivatives .",
    "these will be denoted @xmath54 , where @xmath55 stands for a symmetric multiindex in @xmath22 ( including the `` empty '' multiindex @xmath56 such that @xmath57 ) .",
    "the usual total derivatives @xmath58 can be viewed as acting on smooth functions defined on @xmath59 ( by definition , a smooth function locally depends on a finite number of coordinates ) .    in @xmath59 , we consider a submanifold @xmath60 determined by equation   and all its differential consequences obtained by taking successive total derivatives of both sides of  . on @xmath60 ,",
    "all derivatives of the form @xmath61 become expressible in terms of the others .",
    "therefore , derivatives @xmath54 with @xmath40 occurring no more than twice in @xmath55 serve as natural coordinates along the fibres of @xmath62 .",
    "being tangent to  , the total derivatives admit a restriction to @xmath60 .",
    "we retain the same notation @xmath63 for the restricted total derivatives .",
    "the essence of the adopted point of view can be summarized as follows : a function @xmath64 on @xmath59 satisfies @xmath65 if and only if @xmath64 is zero as a consequence of equation  . from now on we assume that all objects ( like the matrices @xmath4 ) are defined on @xmath60 .",
    "when writing @xmath66)\\right|_{\\mathcal g } = 0\\ ] ] we mean that the zero curvature condition   holds as a consequence of equation  .    in what follows , characteristic elements  @xcite play a crucial role",
    "these are nonabelian analogues of characteristics of conservation laws  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the characteristic element of the initial zero curvature representation   is the @xmath67-matrix @xmath68 this immediately follows from the fact that @xmath69 = c_0 f,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 so that the gauss equation   can be written as @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 , @xmath73 be the parametric zero curvature representation sought , @xmath74 the corresponding characteristic element .",
    "besides  , they will also satisfy the formula  @xcite @xmath75 with @xmath55 running over all symmetric multiindices , including the empty one . here",
    "@xmath76 $ ] , @xmath77 $ ] , the other values being obtained by composition , which can be taken in any order since   implies that @xmath78 commute .",
    "characteristic elements of gauge equivalent zero curvature representations are conjugate ( similar ) .",
    "this allows us to transform characteristic elements into the normal form with respect to conjugation , namely , the jordan normal form .",
    "since the matrix @xmath79 above is diagonal , it follows that for @xmath80 sufficiently close to zero the characteristic element @xmath81 will be also diagonalizable .",
    "however , diagonal matrices have a nontrivial stabilizer @xmath82 with respect to conjugation , which consists of diagonal matrices @xmath83 gauge transformations from the group @xmath84 ( henceforth @xmath84-transformations ) preserve the characteristic elements @xmath81 .",
    "their gauge action on a general @xmath85-valued zero curvature representation @xmath4 is sufficiently simple : @xmath86 and similarly for @xmath87 . using @xmath84-transformations",
    ", one can achieve a unique normal form of matrices @xmath4 as follows : if @xmath88 , then by setting @xmath89 we turn @xmath90 into a symmetric matrix , while in the remaining case @xmath91 the zero curvature representation degenerates to a pair of conservation laws  @xcite .",
    "in other words , being symmetric is a normal form of nondegenerate zero curvature representations with respect to @xmath84-transformations .    turning back to our original problem",
    ", we see that @xmath92 is symmetric , and therefore the nearby matrices @xmath93 can also be symmetrized by an @xmath84-transformation .",
    "a simple calculation shows that , by assuming diagonality of @xmath81 and symmetricity of @xmath93 , we make the system   determined , hence solvable ( actually , we fix the gauge ) .    summarizing , the computation of zero curvature representation has been reduced to solution of the determined system  , under a suitable choice of normal forms for @xmath94 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , this nonlinear system is still quite difficult to solve even with the help of computer algebra . to linearize the system",

    "when incrementing @xmath110 to @xmath120 , nontrivial conditions started to appear , but we also reached the boundaries of our available computing resources .",
    "consequently , our present classification results are still incomplete .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to obtain a passive system of differential equations in several cases .",
    "moreover , in two cases we were able to find @xmath121 explicitly .",
    "one of them were the linear weingarten surfaces  .",
    "their integrability is a well established fact  @xcite , the associated sine - gordon equation @xmath122 being a textbook example of integrability .",

    ", the operator generates only nonlocal symmetries .",
    "we leave as an open problem to find a recursion operator that would generate the third - order symmetry  .",
    "let us conclude this section with some easy geometric observations .",
    "first of all , we can put @xmath144 without loss of generality .",
    "this can be always achieved by rescaling the ambient euclidean metric and , if necessary , changing the orientation .",
    "now , the symmetries of the constant astigmatism equation   have the following geometric interpretation .",
    "translation symmetries are simply reparametrizations of the surface .",
    "the scaling symmetry @xmath145 : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 takes a given surface @xmath20 to the parallel surface @xmath149 .",
    "this is not surprising since parallel surfaces obviously have equal astigmatism in the corresponding points .",
    "finally , swapping the orientation is another symmetry , which can be identified with a composition of the discrete symmetry   and the rescaling @xmath150 .",
    "hence , the discrete symmetry   corresponds to the change of the orientation followed by taking the parallel surface at the unit distance .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , nineteenth century geometers knew of a simple relation between pseudospheric surfaces and surfaces of constant astigmatism , even though they did not find the latter important enough to be named . in this section",
    "we reproduce some of their findings and derive a nonlocal transformation between the constant astigmatism equation   and the famous sine - gordon equation . again , we put @xmath144 for simplicity , meaning that the associated focal surfaces will be of gaussian curvature  @xmath151 .",

    "obviously , a generic surface @xmath157 has two evolutes .",
    "they interchange positions under the change of the orientation .    [",
