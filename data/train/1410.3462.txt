    "searching for the ever growing amounts of varied and dynamically changing images on the social web is important for a number of applications .",
    "the applications include landmark visualization @xcite , visual query suggestion @xcite , training data acquisition @xcite , photo - based question answering @xcite , and photo - based advertisements @xcite , to name a few .",
    "as users often assign tags when posting their images on social media , one might expect tag - based retrieval to be a natural and good starting point for social image retrieval .",
    "compared to content - based search @xcite , tag - based search potentially bypasses the semantic gap problem , and its scalability has been verified by decades of text retrieval research @xcite . however , due to varied reasons , such as diversity in user knowledge , levels of expertise , and tagging intentions , social tagging is known to be ambiguous , subjective , and inaccurate @xcite . moreover , since individual tags are used only once per image in the social tagging paradigm , relevant and irrelevant tags for a specific image are not separable by tag statistics alone . measuring social tag relevance with respect to the visual content they are describing is essential .    for tag relevance estimation ,",
    "quite a few methods have been proposed .",
    "for example , liu _",
    "et al_. propose a nonparametric method to rank tags for a given image by kernel density estimation in a specific visual feature space @xcite .",
    "et al_. train a support vector machine classifier per tag @xcite . given an image and its social tags , zhu _",
    "_ propose to measure the relevance of a specific tag in terms of its semantic similarity to the other tags @xcite . in our earlier work @xcite ,",
    "a neighbor voting algorithm is introduced which exploits tagging redundancies among multiple users . by using learned tag relevance value as a new ranking criterion ,",
    "better image search results are obtained , when compared to image search using original tags .",
    "positioned in a deluge of social data , however , tag relevance estimation is challenging .",
    "visual concepts for example  boat or ` garden ' vary significantly in terms of their visual appearance and visual context .",
    "a single measurement of tag relevance as proposed in previous work is limited to tackle such large variations , resulting in suboptimal image search . at the feature level",
    ", it is now evident that no single feature can represent the visual content completely @xcite .",
    "global features are suited for capturing the gist of scenes @xcite , while local features better depict properties of objects @xcite . as shown previously in content - based image search @xcite , image annotation @xcite , and video concept detection @xcite , fusing multiple visual features",
    "is beneficial .",
    "so it is safe for us to envisage that tag relevance estimation will also benefit from the joint use of diverse features .",
    "the question is _ what is the best strategy _ to maximize such benefit ?    concerning fusion strategies , snoek _ et al .",
    "_ propose the taxonomy of early fusion and late fusion @xcite , which combine multiple sources of information at different stages .",
    "_ are early and late fusion schemes equally effective _ for exploiting diverse features for measuring social tag relevance ?",
    "moreover , for both schemes , supervised learning techniques have been developed to optimize fusion weights , see for instance @xcite . in principle , the learned weights , obtained at the cost of learning from many manually labeled examples , should be better than uniform weights which simply treats individual features ( in early fusion ) and individual tag relevance estimators ( in late fusion ) equally . however , this `` common sense '' is not necessarily valid for social media , which is large - scale , miscellaneous , and dynamically changes . towards coping with the many tags and many images in social media , it is worthy to ask : _",
    "is supervised fusion a must ? _    towards answering the above questions , we make the following contributions :    1 .",
    "we propose visual tag relevance fusion as an extension of tag relevance estimation for social image retrieval . using the neighbor voting algorithm as a base tag relevance estimator @xcite ,",
    "we present a systematic study on early and late tag relevance fusion .",
    "we extend the base estimator for both early and late fusion .",
    "our previous work @xcite , which discusses late tag relevance fusion only , is a special case of this work .",
    "2 .   experiments on a large benchmark @xcite show that tag relevance fusion leads to better image search .",
    "in particular , late fusion which combines both content - based @xcite and semantic - based @xcite tag relevance estimators yields the best performance .",
    "tag relevance fusion is also found to be helpful for acquiring better training examples from socially tagged data for visual concept learning .",
    "3 .   this study offers a practical solution to exploit diverse visual features in estimating image tag relevance .",
    "the problem we study lies at the crossroads of social tag relevance estimation and visual fusion .",
    "so next we present a short review of both areas .",
    "a number of methods have been proposed to attack the tag relevance estimation problem @xcite .",
    "we structure them in terms of the main rationale they use , which is expressed in the following three forms , i.e. , visual consistency @xcite , semantic consistency @xcite , and visual - semantic consistency @xcite . given two images labeled with the same tag ,",
    "the visual consistency based methods conjecture that if one image is visually closer to images labeled with the tag than the other image , then the former image is more relevant to the tag . liu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite employ kernel density estimation in a visual feature space to find such visually close images , while sun _",
    "et al . _",
    "exploit visual consistency to quantify the representativeness of an image with respect to a given tag @xcite .",
    "we introduce a neighbor voting algorithm which infers the relevance of a tag with respect to an image by counting its visual neighbors labeled with that tag @xcite .",
    "et al_. first identify tags which are suited for describing the visual content by a dictionary lookup @xcite .",
    "later , they apply the neighbor voting algorithm to the identified tags . to take into account negative examples of a tag which are ignored in the above works , chen _ et al_. train svm models for individual tags @xcite .",
    "li and snoek take one step further by training svm models with relevant positive and negative examples @xcite .",
    "et al_. investigate semantic consistency @xcite , measuring the relevance of a tag to an image in terms of its semantic similarity to the other tags assigned to the image , ignoring the visual content of the image itself .",
    "et al_. propose to use the position information of the tags , and tags appear top in the list are considered more relevant @xcite .",
    "to jointly exploit visual and semantic consistency , liu _",
    "et al . _",
    "perceive tag relevance estimation as a semi - supervised multi - label learning problem @xcite , while zhu _ et al .",
    "_  formulate the problem as decomposing an image tag co - occurrence matrix @xcite .",
    "_ present a joint image tagging framework which simultaneously refines the noisy tags and learns image classifiers @xcite .",
    "_  propose to improve tag - based image search by visual - text joint hypergraph learning @xcite .",
    "given initial image search results , the authors view the top ranked images as positive instances , and re - rank the search results by hypergraph label propagation . in all the above methods ,",
    "only a single feature is considered .",
    "how to effectively exploit diverse features for tag relevance estimation remains open .",
    "it is also unclear whether fusing the individual and heterogeneous measurements of tag relevance is beneficial .",
    "snoek _ et al_. classify methods for visual fusion into two groups : early fusion and late fusion @xcite .",
    "we follow their taxonomy to organize our literature review on visual fusion . in early fusion ,",
    "a straightforward method is to concatenate individual features to form a new single feature @xcite . as feature dimensionality increases ,",
    "the method suffers from the curse of dimensionality @xcite .",
    "another disadvantage of the method is the difficulty to combine features into a common representation @xcite . instead of feature concatenation ,",
    "another method is to combine visual similarities of the individual features @xcite . in these works , multiple visual ( dis)similarities are linearly combined , with the combination weights optimized by distance metric learning techniques . in the context of video concept detection ,",
    "wang _ et al .",
    "_  also chooses linear fusion to combine similarity graphs defined by different features @xcite . in a recent work for fine - grained image categorization @xcite ,",
    "an image is divided into multi - level hierarchical cells , and spatially adjacent cells are employed to describe the discriminative object components in a coarse - to - fine manner .",
    "graphlets are introduced in @xcite to describe multiple aspects of an image including spatial relationships between pixels and their color / texture distribution . in late fusion , models are obtained separately on the individual features and their output is later combined @xcite . in the work by wu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , base classifiers are trained using distinct features , and the output of the base classifiers forms a new feature vector for obtaining a final classifier .",
    "et al . _",
    "the base classifiers are combined in a boosting framework @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , visual fusion in the tag relevance estimation context",
    "has not been well explored in the literature .",
    "for a valid comparison between early and late fusion , we shall choose the same base tag relevance estimators for both fusion schemes .",
    "thus , before delving into the discussion about tag relevance fusion and its solutions , we first make our choice of base estimators . for the ease of consistent description",
    ", we use @xmath0 to denote an image , and @xmath1 for a social tag .",
    "let @xmath2 be a base tag relevance function whose output is a confidence score of a tag being relevant to an image .",
    "further , let @xmath3 be a source set of social - tagged images , and @xmath4 the set of images labeled with @xmath1 , @xmath5",
    ".    a base estimator should be data - driven and favorably exploit the large amount of social data .",
    "moreover , it should be generic enough to adapt to both early and late fusion . in that regard ,",
    "we choose the neighbor voting algorithm proposed in our previous work @xcite . despite its simplicity , recent studies @xcite report that this algorithm remains the state of the art for tag relevance estimation . in order to find visual neighbors from @xmath6 for a given image @xmath0",
    ", we use @xmath7 to represent a specific visual feature vector .",
    "we also have to specify a distance function for the given feature .",
    "the optimal distance varies in terms of tasks @xcite . as the visual features used in this work , e.g. , color correlogram and bag of visual words , are histogram based , we choose the @xmath8 distance .",
    "we use @xmath9 to represent the @xmath10 nearest visual neighbors of @xmath0 , retrieved by the @xmath8 distance on @xmath11 .",
    "the neighbor voting version of @xmath2 is computed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the cardinality of a set .",
    "the term @xmath14 is the number of neighbor images labeled with @xmath1 .",
    "( [ eq : neighbor - voting ] ) shows that more neighbor images labeled with the tag induces larger tag relevance scores , and in the meantime , common tags with high frequency and thus less descriptive are suppressed by the second term .    in what follows ,",
    "we develop early and late fusion variants of the neighbor voting algorithm , with a conceptual diagram illustrated fig .",
    "[ fig : framework ] .",
    "from an information fusion perspective @xcite , diversity in base tag relevance estimators is important for effective fusion . we generate multiple tag relevance estimators by varying the visual feature @xmath11 , the number of neighbors @xmath10 , or both . for a given feature , as",
    "a larger set of visual neighbors always include a smaller set of visual neighbors , the parameter @xmath10 has a relatively limited impact on the diversity .",
    "hence , we fix @xmath10 and diversify the base estimators by using diverse visual features .",
    "let @xmath15 be a set of such features , and @xmath16 as a base estimator specified by feature @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we adapt the notion of early and late fusion , defining    _ early tag relevance fusion : _ fusion schemes that integrate individual features before estimating social tag relevance scores .    _ late tag relevance fusion : _ fusion schemes that first use individual features to estimate social tag relevance scores separately , and then integrate the scores .",
    "we use @xmath19 to denote a fused tag relevance estimator obtained by early fusion , and @xmath20 to denote a late fused estimator .",
    "the goal of tag relevance fusion is to construct a @xmath21 , let it be @xmath19 in early fusion and @xmath20 in late fusion , so that when @xmath21 is used as an image ranking criterion , better image retrieval is obtained compared to image retrieval using a single - feature estimator .",
    "since linear fusion is a well accepted choice for visual fusion as discussed in section [ ssec : related - work - mmfusion ] , we follow this convention for tag relevance fusion . for early fusion , we aim for a better neighbor set by combining visual similarities defined by the @xmath22 features . concretely , given two images @xmath0 and @xmath23 ,",
    "let @xmath24 be their visual distance computed in terms of feature @xmath17 .",
    "we define the combined distance as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a weight indicating the importance of @xmath17 .",
    "the subscript @xmath27 is to make the dependence of the fused distance on @xmath28 explicit .",
    "we choose features which are intellectually devised , so we assume that they are better than random guess , meaning adding them is helpful for measuring the visual similarity .",
    "hence , we constrain our solution with @xmath29 . since normalizing weights by dividing by their sum does not affect image ranking , any linear fusion with nonnegative weights can be transformed to a convex combination .",
    "so we enforce @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the @xmath10 nearest neighbors retrieved by @xmath32 .",
    "substituting it for @xmath9 in ( [ eq : neighbor - voting ] ) leads to the early fused tag relevance function : @xmath33    in a similar fashion , we define the linear late fused tag relevance function : @xmath34      as distinct features are of varied dimensions and scales , the resultant visual distance scores ( and tag relevance scores ) often reside at varied scales .",
    "score normalization is thus necessary before fusion .",
    "we employ two popular strategies , i.e. , minmax and rankmax . using a specific tag relevance estimator @xmath16 as an example",
    ", its minmax normalized version is defined as : @xmath35 where the min ( max ) function returns the minimum ( maximum ) possible score .",
    "the rankmax normalized @xmath36 is defined as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 returns the rank of image @xmath0 when sorting images by @xmath16 in descending order .",
    "compared to minmax , rankmax quantizes scores into discrete ranks , making it more robust to outliers .",
    "intuitively , for early ( late ) tag relevance fusion , better features ( estimators ) should have larger weights . compared to the simplest solution that treats individual features and base estimators equally , it is not surprising that when we have access to many well - labeled examples , a better solution can be learned .",
    "however , for many tags , well - labeled examples are often of limited availability , making the study of unsupervised fusion necessary .",
    "therefore , we study tag relevance fusion in both unsupervised and supervised settings .      in an unsupervised setting , we have no prior knowledge of which feature or its resultant estimator is most appropriate for a given tag .",
    "according to the principle of maximum entropy @xcite , one shall make the least assumption about things we do not know .",
    "hence , when no prior information concerning @xmath28 is available , we shall use uniform weights . following this thought , we consider fusion by averaging .",
    "* unsupervised early fusion*. the fused distance @xmath32 is the averaged value of @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40    * unsupervised late fusion*. the corresponding @xmath41 is simply the average of @xmath42 : @xmath43 notice that fusing the rankmax normalized functions with the uniform weights is equal to borda count , a common algorithm for combining rankings generated by multiple sources of evidence @xcite .      in an supervised setting , we aim to learn optimal fusion weights from many labeled examples .",
    "for early tag relevance fusion , this is to optimize the combined distance so that the percentage of relevant neighbors will increase , and consequently better tag relevance estimation is achieved . for late tag relevance fusion , this is to optimize the combined tag relevance estimator . in the following ,",
    "we describe two learning algorithms for the two fusion schemes , respectively .",
    "* supervised early fusion*. optimizing fusion weights at the distance level is essentially distance metric learning .",
    "we opt to use the distance learning algorithm introduced by wang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , for its effectiveness for multi - feature neighbor search .",
    "the basic idea is to find a combined distance to force images from the same class to be close , whilst images from different classes to be distant .",
    "this is achieved by solving the following objective function : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a pair of images randomly sampled from the training data , @xmath46 if the two images have labels in common , and @xmath47 otherwise .",
    "* supervised late fusion*. viewing the based estimators @xmath42 as individual ranking criteria for image retrieval , we tackle supervised late tag relevance fusion as a learning - to - rank problem .",
    "let @xmath48 be a performance metric function which measures the effectiveness of @xmath49 on a training set .",
    "we seek @xmath27 that maximizes @xmath50 : @xmath51    among many learning - to - rank algorithms , the coordinate ascent algorithm , developed by metzler and croft in the domain of document retrieval @xcite , can directly optimize ( non - differentiable ) rank - based performance metrics , e.g. , average precision and ndcg . in the context of image auto - annotation @xcite",
    ", we observe that weights learned by coordinate ascent consistently outperforms uniform weights for combining multiple meta classifiers .",
    "we therefore employ coordinate ascent for supervised late tag relevance fusion .    as a variant of hill climbing ,",
    "coordinate ascent attempts to find @xmath27 that maximizes @xmath50 in an iterative manner . in each iteration , a better solution is found by changing a single element of the solution , i.e. , the weight corresponding to a specific base estimator . in particular , let @xmath26 be the parameter being optimized .",
    "we conduct a bi - direction line search with increasing steps to find the optimal value @xmath52 .",
    "if the search succeeds , i.e. , @xmath52 yields a larger @xmath50 , we update @xmath26 with @xmath52 .",
    "then , the next parameter @xmath53 is activated , and the same procedure applies .",
    "the optimization process continues until the objective function no longer increases .",
    "the two fusion schemes , combined with specific normalization and weighting methods , result in the following 12 solutions :    1 .",
    "early - minmax - average : early fusion with minmax normalization and uniform weights ; 2 .",
    "early - rankmax - average : early fusion with rankmax normalization and uniform weights ; 3 .",

    "late - rankmax - learning^+^ : late fusion with rankmax normalization and fusion weights optimized per concept by coordinate ascent .      as discussed in section [ ssec : problem - formalization ] , the parameter @xmath10 does not contribute significantly for diversifying the base estimators .",
    "we empirically fix @xmath10 to be 500 .",
    "concerning the features @xmath54 , we choose the following four visual features which describe image content in different aspects : color , cslbp , gist , and dsift .",
    "color is a 64-dimensional global feature @xcite , combining a 44-d color correlogram , a 14-d texture moments , and a 6-d rgb color moments .",
    "cslbp is a 80-d center - symmetric local binary pattern histogram @xcite , capturing local texture distributions .",
    "gist is a 960-d feature describing dominant spatial structures of a scene by a set of perceptual measures such as naturalness , openness , and roughness @xcite .",
    "dsift is a 1024-d bag of visual words depicting local information of the visual content , obtained by quantizing densely sampled sift descriptors using a precomputed codebook of size 1,024 @xcite .",
    "we will refer to the four base estimators using the corresponding feature names .",
    "_ source set for constructing base estimators_. to instantiate @xmath3 , we use a public set of 3.5 million images collected from flickr in our previous work @xcite .",
    "since batch - tagged images tend to be visually redundant , we remove such images .",
    "also , we remove images having no tags corresponding to wordnet . after this preprocessing step , we obtain a compact set of 815k images .    _",
    "benchmark data_. we choose nus - wide @xcite , a widely used benchmark set for social image retrieval .",
    "this set contains over 250k flickr images , with manually verified annotations for 81 tags which correspond to an array of objects , scenes , and event .",
    "as given in table [ tab : data ] , the nus - wide set consists of two predefined subsets , one training set with 155,545 images and one testing set of 103,688 images .",
    "we evaluate the effectiveness of tag relevance fusion in context of tag - based image retrieval .",
    "that is , for each of the 81 test tags , we sort images labeled with that tag in descending order by ( fused ) tag relevance scores .",
    "_ baselines_. as our goal is to study whether tag relevance fusion helps , the single - feature neighbor voting @xcite is a natural baseline . for a more comprehensive comparison , we implement the following three present - day methods : tag position @xcite , tag ranking @xcite , and semantic field @xcite .",
    "as tag ranking requires a specific visual feature for kernel density estimation in the feature space , we try tag ranking with each of the four features .    _",
    "evaluation criteria_. we use average precision ( ap ) , which is in wide use for evaluating visual search engines .",
    "we also report normalized discounted cumulative gain ( ndcg ) , commonly used to assess the top few ranked results of web search engines @xcite .",
    "we compute ndcg for the top 100 ranked results . for overall comparisons , we average ap and ndcg scores over concepts , reporting map and mndcg .    _ test of statistical significance_. we conduct significance tests , with the null hypothesis that there is no difference in map ( or mndcg ) of two image retrieval systems .",
    "in particular , we use the randomization test as recommended by smucker _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .      in this experiment",
    ", we apply tag relevance fusion to select better training examples for visual concept learning .",
    "the resultant concept classifiers will enable us to search images that are totally unlabeled . concretely , for each test tag , we select its positive training examples from the nus - wide training set , by sorting images in descending order by late - minmax - average , and preserve the top 100 ranked images .",
    "we consider semanticfield and tagrel@xmath55 as two baselines , applying them separately to acquire another two sets of 100 positive training examples . as",
    "the focus is to compare which positive set is better , the same negative training data shall be used .",
    "we take a random subset of 1,000 images from the nus - wide training set as the common negative set , albeit more advanced methods for negative sampling exist @xcite .",

    "all the other fusion solutions are significantly better than tagrel@xmath56 , at the significance level of 0.01 . for a better understanding of the results",
    ", we make a per - concept comparison , see fig .",
    "[ fig : per - concept ] . compared to the best base estimator",
    ", tag relevance fusion improves ap scores for the majority of the concepts .",
    "this can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : per - concept ] that the blue markers , representing early fusion , and the red markers , representing late fusion , are mostly on the right side .",
    "further , for each concept we check the best performer among the four base estimators .",
    "we find that for 21 concepts tagrel@xmath55 is the best , 2 concepts for tagrel@xmath57 , 25 concepts for tagrel@xmath58 , and 34 concepts for tagrel@xmath56 .",
    "then , for every concept we compare early - rankmax - average and late - minmax - average with the concept s best performer , which are concept dependent . for 30 concepts ,",
    "early - rankmax - average outperforms the best performers , while late - minmax - average beats the best performers for 46 concepts .",
    "these results justify the effectiveness of visual fusion for improving tag relevance estimation .    [",
    "tb ! ]    * early tag relevance fusion _ versus _ late tag relevance fusion*. there is no significant difference between early and late fusion in unsupervised settings .",
    "nevertheless , we observe the power of early fusion for addressing concepts that are rarely tagged .",
    "consider ` earthquake ' for instance .",
    "there are only 113 images labeled with the concept in @xmath3 .",
    "the rare occurrence makes the base estimators mostly produce zero score for the concept .",
    "late fusion , with learning or not , does not add much in this case .",
    "in contrast , by directly manipulating the neighbor sets , early - rankmax - learning yields the best result for ` earthquake ' . notice that early fusion needs to combine tens of thousands of visual neighbors , making it computationally more expensive than late fusion . taking into account both effectiveness and efficiency , we recommend late fusion for tag relevance fusion .    for late fusion , late - minmax - average , with map of 0.660 and mndcg of 0.749 , is slightly better than late - rankmax - average , with map of 0.652 and 0.739 . for 54 concepts , late - minmax - average outperforms late - rankmax - average .",
    "this result is mainly due to the fact that the base estimators already include an effect of smoothing by quantizing the visual neighborhood via neighbor voting .",
    "extra quantization by rankmax makes tag relevance estimates less discriminative . only when some base estimators yield large yet inaccurate values such as tagrel@xmath55 for ` rainbow ' , late - rankmax - average is preferred .",
    "* supervised fusion _ versus _",
    "unsupervised fusion*. the supervised methods achieve the best performance for both early and late fusion , see table [ tab : overall - comparison ] .",
    "supervised methods work particularly well for those concepts where there is large variance in the performance of the base estimators .",
    "for early fusion , however , the difference between early - rankmax - learning and early - rankmax - average is not statistically significant . for late fusion ,",
    "the difference in mndcg of late - minmax - learning and late - minmax - average is not statistically significant .",
    "we also look into individual concepts .",
    "although for 49 concepts late - minmax - learning improves over late - minmax - average , there are only 8 concepts having a relative improvement of more than 5% .",
    "learning weights per concept is beneficial . for 65 concepts late - minmax - learning^+^ is better than late - minmax - average , and the number of concepts that have more than 5% relative improvement increases from 8 to 17",
    "nevertheless , because the weights are concept dependent , they are inapplicable to unseen concepts .",
    "overall , the performance of unsupervised fusion is close to supervised fusion .",
    "the result seems counter - intuitive as one would expect a larger improvement from supervised learning .",
    "we attribute this to the following two reasons .",
    "first , due to vagaries of social data , for a number of concepts the models learned from the training data do not generalize well to unseen test data .",
    "second , different from traditional learning - to - rank scenarios where features or rankers might be just better than random guess @xcite , the features employed in this study were intellectually designed and shown to be effective . as shown in table [ tab : overall - comparison ] , the base estimators already provide a strong starting point .",
    "moreover , distinct features result in complementary neighbor sets for early fusion and complementary tag relevance estimates for late fusion .",
    "all this makes fusion with uniform weights a decent choice .    * fusing heterogeneous tag relevance estimators*. to study the effect of fusing heterogeneous tag relevance estimators ,",
    "we include semantic field and the four variants of tag ranking . comparing table [ tab : overall - comparison ] and table [ tab : fuse - all ]",
    ", we find that fusing the varied estimators is helpful .",
    "again , late - minmax - average is comparable to late - minmax - learning in terms of ndcg . with map of 0.700 and mndcg of 0.796",
    ", late - minmax - learning^+^ performs best .",
    "note that the performance difference between late - minmax - learning^+^ and late - minmax - average becomes larger .",
    "the result shows that concept - dependent weights are more needed for fusing tag relevance estimators driven by varied modalities .",
    "we present some image search results in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] . by exploiting diverse features ,",
    "tag relevance fusion is helpful for concepts having larger inter - concept visual ambiguity such as rainbow versus colorful things like balloons .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : top15-car ] that the annotation of nus - wide is incomplete : a number of car images are not labeled as positive examples of ` car ' .",
