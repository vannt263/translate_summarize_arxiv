    "the galaxy populations of clusters are dominated by galaxies of early morphological type , ellipticals and s0s , which form a tight color  magnitude relation ( cmr ) or ` red sequence ' . for decades",
    ", this relation was interpreted as evidence that the stars in early type galaxies in clusters are uniformly old , being formed at redshift @xmath15 , with the slope of the relation being primarily due to a mass - metallicity relation @xcite .",
    "the alternative interpretation of the cmr as being predominantly an age sequence was conclusively ruled out by observations of clusters at @xmath16 , which showed that the slope of the cmr evolves little with redshift @xcite .",
    "a number of studies of clusters conducted with the _ hubble space telescope _ have shown that the cmr of elliptical galaxies remains well established at progressively higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at least up to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the only study to date of the cmr in a cluster at @xmath18 is consistent with this picture @xcite .",
    "measurements of the intrinsic scatter about the cmr can be used to constrain the ages of the constituent stellar populations of cluster early type galaxies , and indicate that major epoch of star formation in clusters was completed at @xmath19 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies up to high redshift similarly indicate that the bulk of stellar populations in elliptical galaxies were formed at @xmath19 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations are consistent with a simple formation scenario for elliptical galaxies , in which they formed the bulk of their stellar mass in a single event at high redshift , and evolved passively thereafter .",
    "however , the latest semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , constructed within the hierarchical formation paradigm , are also able to successfully reproduce the old ages of stellar populations in elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent observations over a wide range in redshift in both clusters and the field have revealed that star formation appears to be completed earlier in higher mass galaxies than in low mass galaxies , a phenomenon dubbed ` downsizing ' @xcite . in color - magnitude diagrams of high redshift clusters ,",
    "this effect manifests itself as a deficit of faint galaxies on the red sequence in comparison to clusters observed at lower redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and may have an environmental dependence in the sense that the faint end of the cmr is populated at earlier times in denser regions , such as in the cluster cores , compared to low density regions such as groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this could be explained qualitatively by a scenario in which the faint end of the red sequence is being built up by the transformation of star forming , spiral galaxies into passively evolving s0s as redshift increases .",
    "up to @xmath20 , studies of magnitude - limited samples of cluster galaxies have revealed that the elliptical galaxy fraction within clusters is found to remain roughly constant , while the fraction of s0 galaxies decreases , with a corresponding increase in the fraction of spiral and irregular galaxies @xcite . when considering stellar mass - limited samples , it has been found that the fraction of massive , early type galaxies as a whole remains roughly constant , at least up to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the much stronger evolution seen in magnitude - limited samples is dominated by fainter , lower mass ( sub-@xmath22 in the galaxy stellar mass function ) galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that at the current time the evidence for downsizing within the centers of rich clusters is still somewhat contentious ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper , we present a study of the galaxy morphologies and color  magnitude relation in xmmxcs j@xmath0 at @xmath1 @xcite , the most distant x - ray selected galaxy cluster currently known . to date , only five other spectroscopically confirmed clusters are known at @xmath23 , xmmu j@xmath24 at @xmath25 , discovered serendipitously with _ xmm - newton _ @xcite ; three clusters at @xmath26 from the irac shallow cluster survey ( iscs ; * ? ? ?",

    "there is mild evidence that the cluster velocity distribution is bimodal , which , if confirmed by further spectroscopic observations , would indicate that the cluster is undergoing a merger close to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin by describing the observations and data reduction in  [ s_observationsdatareduction ] . in  [ s_analysis ] , we describe our photometric measurements , morphological classification , and photometric redshift selection of the cluster members .",
    "we present the morphological fractions , fits to the color  magnitude relation , and inferred ages for the stellar populations of the early type galaxies in  [ s_results ] .",

    "we assume a concordance cosmology of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 throughout , where @xmath36 is the energy density associated with a cosmological constant .",
    "for our study of the galaxy populations of j2215.9@xmath371738 , we use a combination of optical data in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 bands obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; * ? ? ?",

    "similarly , the galaxy distribution is much less compact in j@xmath0 than in j@xmath24 .",

    "unfortunately , one of the detector arrays was inoperable at the time our observations were carried out .",
    "our observations were designed to place the target cluster at the center of the second , working detector array .",
    "we performed imaging in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands , using a 9-point circular dither pattern of radius 25@xmath49 to ensure good sky subtraction .",
    "we obtained a total of 1485 sec of integration in @xmath40 , for an individual frame time of 165 seconds at each dither position . in the @xmath41 band ,",

    "the observations were obtained at airmass @xmath51 .",
    "the seeing was excellent , at @xmath52 in both @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the data were reduced using the ` mcsred ` package for the ` iraf`environment in the standard manner : the individual dither frames were flat fielded , sky subtracted , corrected for distortion caused by the optical design of moircs , and registered to a common pixel coordinate system .",
    "the final science images were created from the @xmath53-clipped mean of the dither frames .",
    "as most of our acs data were obtained before ut 2006 july 04 , we adopted ab photometric zeropoints in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 acs bands of 25.678 and 24.867 respectively .",
    "after this date , the acs photometric zeropoints changed due to a change in the temperature of ccds : frames obtained after this change occurred were adjusted to match the above zeropoints . during the moircs observations , we obtained imaging of several photometric standards from the ukirt faint standards list .",
    "the zeropoints we determined in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands are 26.435@xmath540.007 and 25.900@xmath540.010 on the vega system respectively . for the near infrared data we adopt conversions to the ab magnitude system @xcite of @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes quoted throughout the rest of this paper are on the ab system , unless stated otherwise .    to measure accurate colors for the galaxies in j2215.9@xmath371738 , we need to perform measurements through a consistent set of photometric apertures .",
    "we used the ` sextractor ` package @xcite in dual image mode to achieve this , where objects are detected and apertures are defined using the first image , while photometry is performed on the second image .",
    "we chose to use the moircs @xmath41 image as the detection image .",
    "as the acs and moircs imaging data have different angular and pixel resolution , some additional processing was required prior to performing the photometry .",
    "firstly , we trimmed the acs and moircs images to cover a common area of dimensions @xmath57 , centered on the cluster x - ray position .",
    "this area encloses the overlapping acs coverage from the individual dither frames , rejecting higher noise regions at the edges covered by fewer acs pointings .",
    "we then scaled the moircs images from their native pixel scale of 0.117@xmath49 per pixel to the acs pixel scale of 0.05@xmath49 per pixel , interpolating using a 3rd order spline polynomial .",
    "the moircs images were then registered to the acs images to pixel accuracy .",
    "finally , the acs images were matched to the 0.5@xmath49 angular resolution of the moircs images by convolution with a gaussian filter with @xmath58 pixels .    to estimate the photometric errors in each band",
    ", we constructed rms images for use as weight images by ` sextractor ` .",
    "for the moircs images , we used the rms images produced by the ` mcsred ` data reduction package - these are simply the standard deviation at each pixel derived from the 9 individual dither frames . for the acs images ,",
    "the rms images were constructed from the drizzled science images and the exposure time maps output by the ` multidrizzle ` task , taking into account the photon statistics and the detector read noise .",
    "the drizzling process used to make the final acs science images correlates the pixel - to - pixel noise , which , if ignored , would lead to underestimated photometric errors .",
    "we corrected for this effect following the methodology outlined in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the effect of the interpolation operations on the photometry from the moircs images was tested by cross matching catalogs constructed at the native moircs pixel scale , with catalogs made from the images resampled to match the acs pixel scale .",
    "objects were matched between each catalog within a 0.5@xmath49 radius and the @xmath59 aperture magnitudes were compared .",
    "we found that the median magnitude difference between the two catalogs was @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "we decided to treat the scatter between the catalogs as an additional source of uncertainty : we fitted an exponential model to the scatter as a function of magnitude , applied this model to the @xmath62 aperture magnitudes in the catalog constructed at the acs pixel resolution , and added the results in quadrature to the photometric errors output by ` sextractor ` .",
    "the increase in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 aperture magnitude uncertainties resulting from this procedure is small , @xmath63 mag . at @xmath64 .    to classify objects as stars and galaxies",
    ", we constructed a second set of catalogs in the manner described above , with the exception that the acs images were not matched to the 0.5@xmath49 resolution of the moircs images , and instead were read into ` sextractor ` at their native @xmath65 angular resolution .",
    "we used the neural - network based star - galaxy classification provided by ` sextractor ` ( ` class_star ` ) to determine the object types .",
    "we classify all objects with ` class_star`@xmath66 as measured in the @xmath39 image as galaxies ; all other objects are assumed to be stars .",
    "we chose to carry out the classification in the @xmath39 band , because the @xmath39 image is significantly deeper than the @xmath38 image , reaching an approximate @xmath67 limiting magnitude of @xmath68 for galaxies , compared to @xmath69 for the @xmath38 image ( estimated from the photometric uncertainties ) .",
    "we corrected the photometry for the effect of galactic extinction using the dust maps and software of @xcite . in all that follows , ` sextractor ` ` mag_auto ` magnitudes were adopted as measurements of total galaxy magnitudes , and colors were measured in 1.0@xmath49 diameter circular apertures , equal to twice the seeing of the moircs images .",
    "this is comparable to the typical diameter of the cluster member galaxies .",
    "note that we do not attempt to correct the photometry of objects blended as a consequence of performing the object detection in the @xmath41-band .",
    "only a small number of such objects are seen , perhaps due to the galaxy distribution in j@xmath0 being less compact than other similarly high redshift clusters , as noted in  [ s_observationsdatareduction ] above . as shown in  [ s_resultsmorphologies ] , this has a negligible effect on our results .",
    "morphological classification was performed on all 201 galaxies with magnitudes brighter than @xmath70 , by visual inspection of the @xmath39-band imaging data .",
    "this is @xmath71 magnitudes brighter than the approximate @xmath67 magnitude limit of the @xmath39-band image . due to the high redshift of j@xmath0 ,",
    "the morphological classification was carried out in the rest frame @xmath72-band , rather than the traditional @xmath73-band ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the typical diameter of the cluster member galaxies in the acs imaging is @xmath74 pixels , making detailed morphological classification on the traditional hubble system difficult .",
    "for these reasons , we chose to place the galaxies into four broad morphological bins : elliptical ( e ; corresponding to e1@xmath37e9 on the traditional hubble system ) , lenticular ( s0 ) , spiral ( sp ; sa@xmath37sd , sba@xmath37sbd on the traditional hubble system ) or irregular ( irr ) .",
    "the classification was carried out on the complete sample by a team of five classifiers ( cac , mh , bh , sas , jps ) .",
    "each galaxy in the sample was examined by means of a 150 pixel on a side postage stamp image , centered on the galaxy in question .",
    "no further information on the galaxy to be classified ( e.g. , position , redshift , color or magnitude ) was provided during the classification process , in order to ensure that the classification was determined strictly on the evidence of the imaging data alone , guarding against potential biases .",
    "the same training set of galaxy images , constructed from the @xcite study of galaxy morphologies in @xmath75 clusters , was provided to each classifier .",
    "we found there was generally good agreement on the morphological classification of the individual galaxies among the five classifiers : majority agreement ( i.e. @xmath76% of the votes cast by the classifiers were for a particular morphology ) was reached for 85% of the sample .",
    "agreement by @xmath77 of the classifiers was reached for 67% of the sample .",
    "we estimated the rms scatter between the morphological fractions determined by each classifier and adopted this as our estimate of the morphological classification error , used in  [ s_resultsmorphologies ] below .",
    "for the elliptical galaxy fraction , we measure a scatter of @xmath78 ; for the s0 galaxy fraction , we obtain @xmath79 ; and for the late type galaxy fraction ( sp+irr ) , we obtain @xmath80 .",
    "the uncertainty in the early type galaxy fraction ( e+s0 ) is @xmath81 .",
    "these uncertainties are comparable in size to those obtained by @xcite .",
    "note that in this study we have not taken into account the potential impact of surface brightness dimming , the effect of which can impair the ability to distinguish between , e.g. ellipticals / s0s , and s0/sa galaxies .",
    "@xcite conducted simulations in order to quantify the size of this effect in their acs study of the morphology  density relation in @xmath20 clusters , and found that the effect of surface brightness dimming was successfully mitigated by their chosen exposure times ( typically @xmath82 sec in @xmath39 ) .",
    "we therefore expect that the impact of surface brightness dimming on our results is alleviated to some extent by our long exposure time , @xmath83% longer than the typical exposure time used by @xcite , and by the broad morphological bins we have adopted .",
    "secure spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for a total of 58 galaxies within the @xmath84 field covered by the acs and moircs observations .",
    "the majority of these redshifts come from observations of j@xmath0 using the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 10 m keck ii telescope , and the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ( fors2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 8 m very large telescope ( vlt ) , and are described in @xcite .",
    "observations through a further three deimos slit masks have been obtained subsequent to this work ; one being observed in september 2007 , and two in september 2008 .",
    "details of the 2007 and 2008 keck observations will be presented in s. a. stanford et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) . of the 58 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts , 24 are cluster members , and so we chose to use the available four band ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) photometry to determine cluster membership using photometric redshifts , for all galaxies in the @xmath41-selected catalog described in  [ s_analysisphotometry ] above .",
    "we used the spectral template fitting code ` eazy ` @xcite to estimate photometric redshifts . `",
    "eazy ` has been designed to be especially useful in cases where spectroscopic redshifts are only available for a biased subset of galaxies .",
    "this is the case for our dataset , as color , magnitude criteria were used to preferentially select likely cluster members as spectroscopic targets .",
    "furthermore , the limited size of our spectroscopic subsample makes the use of ` training set'-type techniques inappropriate , such as , e.g. neural - network based redshift estimates @xcite , or iterative correction of empirical spectral templates @xcite .",
    "we used the default set of five spectral templates included with ` eazy ` , which is constructed by applying the non - negative matrix factorization technique of @xcite to a set of 3,000 stellar population models from the pegase library @xcite , and a catalog of synthetic galaxy photometry derived from the semi - analytic simulation of @xcite .",
    "we chose to use the option within ` eazy ` to fit a linear combination of all of the templates to our galaxy catalog , over a redshift range of @xmath85 , using the @xmath59 aperture magnitudes as the input photometry .",
    "finally , we chose to use the @xmath86magnitude based bayesian redshift prior included with ` eazy ` , which is derived from the synthetic , semi - analytic model galaxy photometry used to define the template set , and adopted the maximum likelihood redshift estimate after the application of this prior as the redshift estimate @xmath87 for each galaxy .",
    "we checked the accuracy of the photometric redshift estimates produced by ` eazy ` by comparison with the spectroscopic subsample .",
    "given the wavelength coverage of our available photometric bands , we would not expect to obtain reliable photometric redshifts for galaxies with redshifts below @xmath13 , as photometric redshift techniques rely on identifying strong spectral breaks in order to assign redshift estimates , and the @xmath38-band only drops below 4000  in the rest frame at @xmath88 .",
    "we therefore performed the check on the photometric redshift accuracy on the 36 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath89 .",
    "we found that the typical scatter @xmath90 in the photometric redshift residuals @xmath91 was @xmath92 , where @xmath90 was estimated using a biweight scale estimator ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is robust to outliers .",
    "the photometric redshifts appear to be almost unbiased in this redshift range , as the median @xmath93 ; however , a small number of objects have overestimated photometric redshifts , as can be seen from the negative tail of the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ f_zpzshistogram ] .",
    "a cut of @xmath94 was used to define cluster membership , where @xmath95 is the cluster redshift of @xmath1 - i.e. galaxies with @xmath96 were considered to be members of the cluster .",
    "we used the spectroscopic subsample to assess the amount of contamination from galaxies with spurious photometric redshifts ( i.e. with @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) ; contamination from interlopers , defined as galaxies with velocities outside of the range @xmath99 around the cluster redshift , where @xmath100 is the line of sight velocity dispersion measured in @xcite ( i.e. @xmath101 or @xmath102 , but @xmath103 ) ; and missing spectroscopically identified members ( i.e. with @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .    initially , using only the cut in @xmath87 to define membership , a total of 13 galaxies ( 22% of the spectroscopic subsample ) were identified as having spurious photometric redshifts , all with @xmath107 .",
    "however , galaxies with unreliable photometric redshift estimates have flat or multi - modal posterior redshift probability distributions , and can be easily identified by their @xmath108 value ( introduced by * ? ? ? * and labelled ` odds ` in the output from ` eazy ` ) , which is the fraction of the integrated probability that lies within @xmath109 of the photometric redshift estimate @xmath87 ( in the case of ` eazy ` , @xmath110 ) .",
    "galaxies with lower @xmath108 values have broader redshift probability distributions , and correspondingly less reliable photometric redshift estimates . applying a cut of @xmath111",
    "reduces the number of spurious photometric redshifts in the spectroscopic subsample to two galaxies ( 3.4% of the spectroscopic subsample ) .",
    "we therefore chose to use this cut in @xmath108 in all that follows .",
    "a more conservative cut of @xmath112 reduces the number of galaxies with spurious photometric redshifts to just a single galaxy , but this comes at the cost of a smaller sample size and increased error bars on the derived color  magnitude relation parameters ( see  [ s_resultscmrs ] ) .",
    "the number of spectroscopically confirmed non cluster members contaminating the photometrically selected sample was found to be three ( 10.3% of the sample ) .",
    "however , four spectroscopically confirmed cluster members were missed by the photometric redshift selection ( 16.7% of the sample of 24 confirmed cluster members ) .",
    "using a broader cut in @xmath87 than we have applied naturally reduces the fraction of missed spectroscopic members , but at the cost of significantly increasing the contamination from spectroscopically confirmed interlopers .",
    "we show in  [ s_resultsmorphologies ] and  [ s_resultscmrs ] that our measurements are robust to reasonable changes of the parameters governing the photometric redshift selection .",
    "we further refined our photometric membership selection by excluding from the sample all galaxies with @xmath41-band magnitudes brighter than the bcg , i.e. @xmath113 . although j@xmath0 lacks an obvious bcg , it possesses several candidates that are of similar brightness ( see * ? ? ? * ) , and this additional cut helps by removing seven bright , blue ( @xmath114 ) , lower redshift galaxies from the sample .",
    "these objects are probably at @xmath115 , as indicated from their photometric redshifts , and one of these objects is a known interloper with spectroscopic redshift @xmath116 . finally , we removed from the sample all known interlopers with spectroscopic redshifts , and added back in the four spectroscopically confirmed members missed by the photometric redshift selection .    the final sample of photometrically selected members within the acs / moircs imaging area contains 64 galaxies .",

    "however , it is known that the cluster - to - cluster scatter of the dgr is considerable @xcite , and study of a larger sample of clusters , ideally with large numbers of spectroscopically confirmed members , at similar redshift to j@xmath0 is required in order to confirm whether or not this holds for the general population at this epoch .",
    "we have conducted a study of the morphological fractions and color  magnitude relation in the galaxy cluster xmmxcs j@xmath0 at @xmath1 .",
    "this is the first such study of an x - ray selected cluster at @xmath268 .",
    "we found :    1 .",
    "the brightest members of j@xmath0 have @xmath41 magnitudes corresponding to the expected value of @xmath269 in the galaxy luminosity function .",

    "the morphological fractions are @xmath270 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , similar to other clusters at @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the dominant component of the galaxy population observed in clusters at low redshift was already in place @xmath5 gyr after the big bang .",
    "3 .   after transformation from @xmath6 to @xmath249 , the slope of the color  magnitude relation is consistent with that of the coma cluster , implying little evolution over the last @xmath7 gyr , though the measurement uncertainty is large .",
    "in contrast , the intrinsic scatter about the color  magnitude relation is more than three times the value measured in the coma cluster , after conversion from @xmath6 to @xmath249 .",
    "4 .   from comparison with stellar population models , the intrinsic scatter about the color ",
    "magnitude relation implies mean luminosity weighted ages for the stellar populations of the early type galaxies in j@xmath0 of @xmath9 gyr , corresponding to the main epoch of star formation in these galaxies coming to an end at @xmath10 .",
    "comparison of the intercept of the color ",
    "magnitude relation with passive evolution of the same stellar population models , calibrated relative to the coma cluster , yields consistent results . 5 .",
    "j@xmath0 shows evidence of the ` downsizing ' phenomenon : the red sequence dwarf - to - giant ratio for the cluster is @xmath11 within a radius of @xmath12 , although this is likely to be underestimated slightly in comparison to other studies due to the depth of our photometry .",
