    "the first observation of high-@xmath0 superconductivity in cuprates ( copper oxide la - ba - cu - o compound ) was reported almost quarter century ago @xcite . since then",
    "an intensive both theoretical and experimental research studies have been carried out on revealing the microscopic origin of the high-@xmath0 superconductivity . in despite of decades of investigations at present there is no consent about the microscopic mechanism that bounds electrons ( holes ) into pairs , and consequently leads to high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "normal state of cuprates also exhibit a variety of phase states .",
    "the early and subsequent studies show that an electronic subsystem in the cuprates is strongly correlated and role of the electron - lattice interactions are significant @xcite .",
    "it has been understood that a number of physical parameters of the cuprates as well as the critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) strongly depend on a variety of factors as oxygen content , doping level , applied pressure or strain for films , and etc .",
    "similar to some low-@xmath0 superconductors an applied external pressure increases the value of @xmath0 of copper based oxides .",
    "the highest critical temperature @xmath2 k was obtained for hgba@xmath3ca@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 under hydrostatic pressure @xcite ( @xmath6 k at ambient pressure @xcite ) .",
    "so far an external pressure remains as powerful tool that affects all physical parameters of a sample simultaneously and influences the value of critical temperature .",
    "however , the influence of an external pressure to the cuprates is not a straightforward . in particular , it is the case when considering the dependence of a critical temperature on applied external pressure .",
    "the same is true for the films grown on various substrates . in the latter case pressure",
    "originates from lattice mismatch between substrate and film .",
    "the lattice mismatch causes a microscopic strain which in its turn , on the analogy of pressure , vary the critical temperature . due to quasi two dimensional ( 2d ) lattice structure and strong anisotropy of the properties of cuprates",
    "the dependence of the critical temperature on uniaxial strain ( pressure ) is not simple . for many cuprate compounds compressive uniaxial strain ( pressure ) in the cuo@xmath3 plane ( along @xmath7- or @xmath8- axes )",
    "enhances @xmath0 , while compressive uniaxial strain ( pressure ) along @xmath9- axis reduces @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there are contradictorily reports in the cases of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath10 and gdba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath10 where compressive strain ( pressure ) in the cuo@xmath3 plane gives rise to increase @xcite or decrease @xcite of the critical temperature . moreover , the sign of the pressure derivatives of @xmath0 along @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes are different for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "uniaxial pressure study of electron - doped cuprate nd@xmath11ce@xmath12cuo@xmath13 has shown that dependence of the critical temperature of the electron doped compound are the same with those of hole doped counterparts @xcite .",
    "there are a few theoretical studies of the effect of an uniaxial strain ( pressure ) on the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "goddard estimated the effect of the pressure on the critical temperature of the optimally doped la@xmath3cuo@xmath13 within the magnon pairing model @xcite .",
    "the analytical formula for @xmath0 was obtained in the weak coupling bcs approach .",
    "the coupling parameters of the model enter to the formula of @xmath0 and depend on the orbital overlaps .",
    "an applied pressure decreases the distance between the centers of orbits , and this in its turn leads to the exponential increase of coupling parameters . in this way @xmath0",
    "is affected by the pressure ( strain ) .",
    "the uniaxial pressure results of goddard along @xmath7- and @xmath8- axes are in good agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . meanwhile , the prediction of the model with regard to the effect of the pressure along @xmath9 axis is smaller than those results of ref .",
    "@xcite by order .",
    "the effect of the uniaxial stress to the critical temperature @xmath0 of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath14 cuprate was studied by li in ref.@xcite in terms of the anisotropy of the density of states at the fermi energy . using a simple picture of van hove singularity of high-@xmath0 superconductors",
    "li was able satisfactorily reproduce the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and qualitatively explain the anisotropy of strain derivatives of the critical temperature .",
    "the main features of the work @xcite are : ( i ) consideration is pure two dimensional ; ( ii ) weak coupling bcs formula for @xmath0 or spin fluctuation induced superconductivity formula of pines is applied to study the dependence of @xmath0 on uniaxial stress . in reality",
    "the cuprates have quasi two dimensional structure and it is believed that bcs approach hardly applicable to the cuprates . in addition , ref .",

    "klein and simanovsky studied in ref .",
    "@xcite anisotropic pressure dependence of @xmath0 of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath14 within the framework of tunneling unit model .",
    "it was assumed that the conduction electrons scatter in so called tunneling units ( double - well potentials ) that are oriented along @xmath7 axis.the uniaxial strain along @xmath7 axis was associated with the change of microscopic width of the tunneling unit ( the distance between the two wells ) . within the model",
    "it is appears that the change of @xmath0 in direct proportion to the relative change of microscopic width of tunneling unit .",
    "the pressure derivatives of @xmath0 along both @xmath15 and @xmath8 axes was calculated in close agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the strain derivative of @xmath0 along @xmath8 axis was interrelated with those of along @xmath7 axis .",
    "according ref.@xcite uniaxial compressive pressure in the @xmath8 direction decreases the distances in the @xmath8 direction , while the those increases the distances in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "however , the effect of the uniaxial pressure ( strain ) along @xmath7 or @xmath8 axis to the expansion of the distances along @xmath9 axis and contribution arising from this interrelation to @xmath0 was not discussed .",

    "though the theoretical results of ref .",
    "@xcite are in good agreement with experiments , the reduction of @xmath0 under uniaxial pressure along @xmath9-axis was mainly attributed due to the pressure - induced increase of holes density in cuo@xmath3- plane ( so - called pressure induced charge transfer model ( pictm ) @xcite ) . in the meanwhile , the same pictm fails to explain the uniaxial pressure effects in the @xmath17- plane of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the cumulative effect of the strains in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes to @xmath0 of bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath18 , the strains in both @xmath7 and @xmath9 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) to @xmath0 of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath19 were discussed in ref . @xcite .",
    "such type of consideration is necessarily when one studying the dependence of @xmath0 of cuprate films grown in various substrates .",
    "indeed , due to mismatch of the lattice parameters ( periods ) of film and substrate the grown film is exposed to stress along all axes simultaneously . if lattice period of a substrate is smaller ( lager ) than those of a film then the grown film experiences compressive ( tensile ) stress in the plane parallel to the boundary plane of film and substrate .",
    "the compressive ( tensile ) stress of the film along @xmath17 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 planes gives rise to lengthening ( shortening ) of the distances along @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes , respectively .",
    "the importance of account of the stress along @xmath9 axis was emphasized in ref .",
    "moreover , the highest @xmath22 k was achieved for la@xmath23sr@xmath24cuo@xmath13 film mainly due to cumulative effect of all axes stresses @xcite .",
    "the experimental data obtained so far and tested models for different cuprate compounds suggest that the phenomenon is complex and differ for various compounds .",
    "nevertheless there are common features too . as a consequence at present one",
    "experiences a need of a model that able to explain all experimental data from universal points of view or to point out , at least , the most relevant contributions . from theoretical point of view",
    "the works @xcite study the effect of uniaxial strain on @xmath0 totally ignoring quasi two dimensionality of the structure of cuprates .",
    "in addition , they ignore the most relevant electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the crucial role of electron - phonon interaction in cuprates comes from different experiments @xcite .",
    "it is well established that electron - phonon interaction in cuprates is strong and ( bi)polaron is formed in the cuprates @xcite .",

    "we will try to fill this blank .",
    "we study an effect of uniaxial strain to @xmath0 within the framework of the extended holstein - hubbard model ( ehhm ) .",
    "ehhm is believed appropriate model for study strongly correlated electron - phonon systems .",
    "an estimation of @xmath0 within the model will be given for a chain model of cuprates at strong coupling limit and nonadiabatic regime , and discussion of the obtained results with regard to la - based high-@xmath0 films will be done . here",
    "we associate @xmath0 with the bose - einstein condensation temperature of intersite bipolarons which form due to strong electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the systems that have strongly correlated electron and strongly coupled electron - phonon subsystems can be described by means of extended holstein - hubbard model which proved to be a more realistic model for cuprates .",
    "hamiltonian of the system is given by @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 describes hopping of electrons between adjacent sites , @xmath27 is hamiltonain of phonon system , @xmath28 is hamiltonian of interacting particles on sites @xmath29 and @xmath30 via coulomb forces , @xmath31 is hamiltonian of electron - phonon interaction . here",

    "ehhm enables one to take into account electron correlations and long range feature of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "many physical properties of cuprates were satisfactorily explained within the ehhm ( see for example @xcite ) as well as the possibility of formation of intersite bipolarons with @xmath48- , @xmath49- and @xmath50- type wave functions @xcite .",
    "the possibility of formation of magnetic bipolaron with @xmath50- type wave function is also shown in ref .",

    "though model hamiltonian eq.(1 ) enables one to study polaron and bipolaron formation in a discrete lattice , here for the sake of simplicity estimation of polaron s mass will be done without the term eq.(4 ) ( i.e. within extended holstein model ) and for the dispersionless phonons . in strong electron - phonon coupling limit and nonadiabatic regime use of the standard procedures such as",
    "lang - firsov transformation @xcite eliminates electron - phonon interaction term ( 5 ) .",

    "convincing evidence for a such coupling of in - plane holes with the @xmath57- axis polarized vibrations of apical ions comes from many experiments ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "therefore from here we will omit index @xmath36 and consider only that component of the electron - lattice force which represents an interaction of a hole on cuo@xmath3 plane with the @xmath57- axis polarized apical oxygen vibrations .",

    "for the sake of simplicity we suppose that intersite bipolarons form an ideal gas of charged carriers and mass of bipolaron is @xmath66 ( this point does not lead to loose of generality ) .",
    "then the temperature of bose - einstein condensation of the intersite bipolarons defines as @xmath67 here @xmath68 is boltzmann constant and @xmath69 is density of intersite bipolarons .",

    "in contrast with other cuprates la@xmath71sr@xmath18cuo@xmath13 has somewhat a simplest crystal structure and serves as a test material for a variety of theoretical models .",
    "in addition , it is commonly believed that pressure induced charge transfer model ( pictm ) @xcite does not work in la@xmath71sr@xmath18cuo@xmath13 compound due to lack of chain structures . in these circumstances",

    "the results are visualized in fig.2 . as one",

    "let us now turn our attention to the results of two particular experiments of refs .",
    "the experiments report about the growth of thin la - based high-@xmath0 films on various substrates and an influence of lattice mismatch between film and substrate to the @xmath0 .    as reported in @xcite sato and naito have grown of ( 001 ) oriented la@xmath103sr@xmath104cuo@xmath13 ( lsco ) thin films on lasralo@xmath13 ( lsao ) and srtio@xmath4 ( sto ) substrates by reactive co - evaporation method .",
    "unstrained in - plane lattice parameters of these lsco , lsao and sto are 3.777  , 3.756  and 3.905  , respectively .",
    "they were able to obtain lsco film on lsao substrate with @xmath0 as high as 44 k , which is approximately 7 k higher than that for single lsco crystal under ambient pressure .",
    "for the films on sto substrates they obtained @xmath105 k. x - ray diffraction measurements of lsco thin films grown on lsao ( sto ) substrate clearly showed that the lattice parameter of cuo@xmath3- plane is compressed by 0.4@xmath106 ( expanded by 1.6@xmath106 ) , while @xmath107-axis is expanded by 0.5@xmath106 ( compressed by 0.4@xmath106 ) . as a matter of recorded results from structural analysis sato and naito concluded that increase ( decrease ) of @xmath0",
    "is directly related to both the compression ( tension ) of cuo@xmath3- plane by the strain generated by lattice mismatch and the expansion ( shortening ) of the @xmath9- axis due to the poisson effect .",
    "the ratio of the strain along @xmath9- axis to the strain of cuo@xmath3-plane lattice parameter were : @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the films grown on lsao and sto substrates , respectively .",
    "we have performed calculation of @xmath1 according to the eqs.(6)-(8 ) taking into account the above relations @xmath110 .",
    "the results are presented graphically in fig.3(a ) .",
    "for the compressive strain @xmath111 our model yields @xmath112 k which is very close to the observed value of @xmath113 k for lsco film grown on lsao substrate . in the meantime for the tensile strain @xmath114 our model yields @xmath115 k which is also very close to the observed value of @xmath105 k for lsco film grown on sto substrate .",
    "one should notice that there is an excellent agreement between our results and the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "locquet et al reported growth of la@xmath23sr@xmath24cuo@xmath13 ( lsco ) thin films on lasralo@xmath13 ( lsao ) and srtio@xmath4 ( sto ) substrates by the block - by - block molecular epitaxial method in ref .",
    "the @xmath116 x - ray measurements revealed that the grown films strongly strained both in cuo@xmath3-plane and out of the plane .",
    "the film grown on lsao substrate was found strained with parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the same parameters for the film grown on sto substrate were found as @xmath119 and @xmath120 . the ratio of the strains @xmath110 for the films grown on lsao and sto substrates are 1.2 and 0.65 , respectively .",

    "for the compressive lattice strain @xmath124 and the relation @xmath122 our model yields the value of @xmath125 k , while for the tensile strain @xmath126 and the relation @xmath123 one obtains @xmath127 k. as one can see our result @xmath125 k is in reasonable agreement with the value of @xmath22 k for the film on lsao substrate .",
    "however , there is some discrepancy of the value of @xmath128 k from observed value of @xmath129 k for the film on sto substrate .",
    "let s now briefly discuss some aspects of our model and its results .",
    "as pointed out above our model takes into account the most relevant interaction in cuprates which is electron - phonon interaction .",
    "we were able satisfactorily explain the @xmath0 of la - based high-@xmath0 films within the framework of ehhm and in the assumption of formation of ideal bose - gas of intersite bipolarons .",
    "some discrepancies of our results from the experimental results might be as result of several factors : ( i ) the simplest of our model lattice under study .",
    "in reality one should consider more complex structures ; ( ii ) the choice of the analytical formula for the density - displacement type electron - lattice force ; ( iii ) an assumption that intersite bipolarons form an ideal bose - gas .",
    "in reality due to other factors there are may be deviation from an ideality thus forming nonideal bose - gas or bose - liquid ; ( iv ) superconductivity of the la - based films may be due to not the only electron - phonon interaction , but has contributions from other interactions as well . these factors suggest performance of more comprehensive research on the studied problem .",
    "even though we have considered a very simple lattice model its common features are consistent qualitatively with many experimental observations .",
    "indeed , in our model compressive strain in @xmath17-plane of high-@xmath0 cuprates gives rise an increase of @xmath0 , while that of along @xmath57-axis acts contrary .",
    "such a type variations of @xmath0 with respect to the strains were observed in many la - based cuprates @xcite .",
    "this feature is common both to films @xcite and bulk samples @xcite .",
    "though our model allows one estimate @xmath1 at any @xmath130 there are might be technological limits in obtaining of films with a large value of strains induced by lattice mismatch .",
    "it is also worthwhile to notice that our consideration are limited to the films of optimal thickness . because of generality of our approach one might want to extend the model to other cuprates .",
    "in general , there is no restrictions for that .",
    "however , in each case specific features of a compound ( film or bulk sample ) must be taken into an account .",
    "in this paper we have considered an effect of uniaxial strain ( pressure or stress ) to the superconducting critical temperature of cuprates . a brief survey of both experimental and theoretical works on the effect of the uniaxial pressure ( strain or stress ) to @xmath0 of cuprates ( bulk and film samples ) reveal that the phenomenon is complex and there are contradictory reports too .",
