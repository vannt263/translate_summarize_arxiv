    "in the past few years , the developments in the nonlinear optics of photorefractive materials @xcite and of bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices @xcite have stimulated an enormous amount of theoretical , numerical and experimental activity in the area of discrete nonlinear hamiltonian systems . a particular focus in this effort has been drawn to the prototypical lattice model of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite .",
    "the latter , either as a tight binding limit @xcite , or as a generic discrete nonlinear envelope wave equation @xcite plays a key role in unveiling the relevant dynamics within the appropriate length and time scales .",
    "one of the principal directions of interest in these lattice systems consists of the effort to analyze the main features of their localized solutions . in the particular case of two spatial dimensions",
    ", such structures can be regular discrete solitons @xcite or discrete vortices ( i.e. , structures that have topological charge over a discrete contour ) @xcite .",
    "the study of these types of coherent structures has made substantial leaps of progress in the past two years with the numerical and experimental observation of regular discrete solitons @xcite , dipole solitons @xcite , soliton - trains @xcite , soliton - necklaces @xcite and vector solitons @xcite in photorefractive crystals and experimental discovery of robust discrete vortex states @xcite , based on earlier theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the recent years were marked by the experimental developments in soft condensed - matter physics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . among the important recent observations one can single out the experimental illustration of the dark @xcite , bright @xcite and gap @xcite solitons in quasi - one dimensional becs .",
    "the experimental capabilities seem to be on the verge of producing similar structures in a two - dimensional context @xcite .    in both of the above contexts ( nonlinear optics and atomic physics ) ,",
    "multi - component systems were recently studied due to their relevance to applications . in particular ,",
    "the first observations of discrete vector solitons in nonlinear waveguide arrays were reported in @xcite , while numerous experiments with becs were directed towards studies of mixtures of different spin states of @xmath0rb @xcite or @xmath1na @xcite and even ones of different atomic species such as @xmath2k@xmath0rb @xcite and @xmath3li@xmath4cs @xcite .",
    "while the above bec experiments did not include the presence of an optical lattice , the addition of an external optical potential could be manufactured within the present experimental capabilities @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to address these recent features of the physical experiments , namely discrete systems with multiple components .",
    "in particular , we aim at addressing the fundamental issue of how localized excitations are affected by the presence of _ two _ components which are coupled ( nonlinearly ) to each other .",
    "while our results will be presented for the specific example of two coupled dnls equations with cubic nonlinearities , we believe that similar features persist in a variety of other models .",
    "we should note here that rather few studies have focused on the two - dimensional vector generalization of the dnls equation @xcite . among others ,",
    "we mention the work @xcite which was motivated by the experimental system of the nonlinear waveguide arrays proposed in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", these earlier studies did not address vortices in coupled discrete systems .    for vortices in coupled systems",
    ", a number of interesting questions emerges concerning the stability of particular vortex configurations ( e.g. the so - called vortex cross @xcite ) including the case of equal charges in both components and the case of opposite charges between the two components .",
    "the former state has a double vortex charge , while the latter has a hidden vortex charge .",
    "it has been shown for the continuous nls equation with cubic - quintic @xcite and saturable @xcite nonlinearities that these two states have different stability windows .    in the present setting",
    ", we examine the stability of such vortex structures in the discrete case both analytically and numerically .",
    "we use the method of lyapunov - schmidt reductions developed earlier in @xcite .",
    "this method allows for direct analytical calculations of eigenvalues of the linear stability problem as functions of the system parameters ( such as the coupling between adjacent lattice sites and the coupling between the two components ) .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the setup and the vortex cross configurations . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the stability of such configurations in the one - component model . in section 4",
    ", we generalize the vortex cross configuration to the two - component case and compare our results with numerical computations of the parameter continuations . in section 5 , we deal with a special manakov case of the system of two dnls equations .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we summarize our findings .",
