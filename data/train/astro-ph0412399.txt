    "the result of calculations shows that the total energy surface @xmath80 for @xmath81a.u . has global minimum at @xmath82 and a finite internuclear distance @xmath83 which gives rise a valley when @xmath49 begins to vary . for smaller magnetic fields there",
    "exists either no minimum or at most some irregularity . hence if the minima exists the optimal configuration for fixed magnetic field @xmath81a.u",

    "the total energy @xmath88 , binding energy @xmath89 and equilibrium distance @xmath90 as well as the position and the height of the barrier on the total energy curve of the system @xmath0 in parallel configuration for various magnetic fields are presented in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "binding energy of @xmath6 is always larger than the binding energy of the hydrogen atom .",

    "_ we presented theoretical arguments about a possible existence of exotic ions @xmath32 and @xmath120 as well as some indications to the existence of the exotic ions @xmath121 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "a striking conclusion can be drawn that the exotic molecular ion @xmath33 is the most bound one - electron system among those made from protons and/or @xmath10particles at strong magnetic field @xmath122 a.u .",
