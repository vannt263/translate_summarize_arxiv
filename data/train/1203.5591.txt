    "the famous `` ham sandwich '' theorem of stone , tukey , and steinhaus  @xcite asserts that every @xmath2 absolutely continuous probability measures in @xmath1 can be simultaneously partitioned into equal parts by a single hyperplane .    in  @xcite m.  kano and s.",
    "bereg raised the following question ( in the planar case ) : if we are given @xmath0 measures in @xmath1 and want to cut the same ( but unknown ) fraction of every measure by a hyperplane then what assumptions on the measures allow us to do so ? certainly , additional assumptions are required because if the measures are concentrated near vertices of a @xmath2-simplex then such a fraction cut is impossible .",
    "a sufficient assumption is described below :    let @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,  , @xmath5 be absolutely continuous probability measures on @xmath1 and let @xmath6 . call the set of measures _ @xmath7-not - permuted _",
    "if for any halfspace @xmath8 the inequalities @xmath9 for all @xmath10 imply @xmath11    [ re : not - permutation ] for @xmath12 consider all halfspaces @xmath8 in @xmath13 such that @xmath14 for all @xmath15 and the values @xmath16 are pairwise distinct .",
    "if we arrange the values @xmath16 in the ascending order then we get some permutation of @xmath17 .",
    "so the measures @xmath18 are @xmath7-not - permuted if and only if in such a way we can not get all possible permutations of the @xmath0 element set .",
    "a natural example of @xmath7-not - permuted measures appears when the support of one measure lies in the interior of the convex hull of the union of supports of the other @xmath2 measures . in this case",
    "the measures are @xmath7-not - permuted for sufficiently small @xmath7 .",
    "now we state the main result :    [ thm : fraction - cut ] suppose @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath19 , @xmath5 are absolutely continuous probability @xmath7-not - permuted measures in @xmath1 for some @xmath20 .",
    "then there exists a halfspace @xmath8 such that @xmath21.\\ ] ]    note that in  @xcite a similar problem was considered : cut by a hyperplane a _ prescribed _ fraction of each of @xmath2 measures in @xmath1 .",
    "again , this can not be done in general and some additional assumptions were needed .",
    "a straightforward consequence of theorem  [ thm : fraction - cut ] follows by considering one measure concentrated near a point :    suppose @xmath4 , @xmath19 , @xmath5 are absolutely continuous probability measures in @xmath1 and @xmath22 is a point in the convex hull of their supports .",
    "then there exists a halfspace @xmath8 such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in section",
    "[ discrete - sec ] we consider a discrete version of theorem  [ thm : fraction - cut ] , replacing measures by finite point sets .",
    "this is in accordance with the initial statement of the problem in  @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ convex - cut - sec ] we consider a problem of cutting the same _ prescribed _ fraction of every measure , this time allowing cutting with a convex subset of @xmath1 .",
    "we thank nikolay  dolbilin for drawing our attention to this problem .",
    "we also thank fedor petrov , imre brny , and pavle blagojevi for useful remarks .",
    "in order to prove theorem  [ thm : fraction - cut ] we need a version of the `` ham sandwich '' theorem  @xcite for charges :    a difference @xmath25 of two absolutely continuous finite measures on @xmath1 is called a _",
    "charge_. in other words , the charge is represented by its density from @xmath26 .",
    "[ thm : ham - sandwich ] suppose we are given @xmath2 charges @xmath27 , @xmath19 , @xmath28 in @xmath1 , then there exists a ( possibly degenerate ) halfspace @xmath8 such that for any @xmath15 @xmath29    a _ degenerate halfspace _ is either @xmath30 of the whole @xmath1 .",
    "we can not exclude degenerate halfspaces in this theorem when @xmath31 s are all zero .",
    "the reason is the same for which we can not exclude the `` @xmath7-not - permuted '' assumption from theorem  [ thm : fraction - cut ] , see also remark  [ counterexample ] below .    the classical proof from the book of matouek  @xcite passes for charges ( the authors learned this fact long ago from vladimir  dolnikov ) .",
    "identify @xmath1 with @xmath32 .",
    "parameterize halfspaces @xmath33 with boundary passing through the origin by their inner normals .",
    "so all halfspaces @xmath34 ( including degenerate ) are parameterized by the unit sphere @xmath35 .",
    "if we map every halfspace to the vector @xmath36 then we obtain a continuous odd map @xmath37 ; by the borsuk ",
    "ulam theorem  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) one halfspace must be mapped to zero .",
    "as the first attempt we try to apply the ham sandwich theorem for charges to @xmath38 this way we easily obtain a halfspace @xmath8 such that @xmath39 .",
    "but the halfspace @xmath8 may be degenerate or @xmath16 may be all zero .",
    "this is not what we want .",
    "[ counterexample ] by the way , we see that starting from three measures @xmath18 on @xmath40 distributed along three rays emanating from vertices of a regular triangle and going outside it , we can not cut the same fraction ( possibly zero ) of these measures by a non - degenerate halfplane .",
    "the same example generalizes to higher dimensions and shows that in the ham sandwich theorem for charges we can not avoid using degenerate halfspaces when all charges satisfy @xmath41 .",
    "so let us perturb the charges with a small positive parameter @xmath42 : @xmath43 now theorem  [ thm : ham - sandwich ] gives a halfspace @xmath8 with : @xmath44 this is equivalent to the following equalities : @xmath45 suppose @xmath9 for all @xmath46",
    ". then we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "hence @xmath49    this contradicts the assumption that the measures are _ @xmath7-not - permuted_.    hence the inequality @xmath50 for some @xmath15 is guaranteed while we decrease @xmath42 to @xmath51 , and in turn it guarantees ( remember that we can interchange @xmath8 and @xmath52 ! ) that @xmath8 can not approach degenerate halfspaces @xmath30 and @xmath1 .",
    "so we assume by compactness that @xmath8 tends to a certain halfspace as @xmath53 and going to the limit in ( [ eq : s - part ] ) together with ( [ eq : equal - part ] ) we obtain the conclusion .",
    "in the paper @xcite bereg and kano consider a discrete version of this theorem in the plane .",
    "they call a line @xmath54 _ balanced _ if each half - plane bounded by @xmath54 contains precisely the same number of points of each color .",
    "[ thm : bereg kano ] let @xmath55 be a set of @xmath56 points in the plane in general position colored in red / blue / green such that + ( i ) the number of points of each color is @xmath57 ; + ( ii ) the vertices of the convex hull of @xmath55 have the same color .",
    "+ then there exists a balanced line of @xmath55 .",
    "here we generalize the result of bereg and kano as follows :    [ thm : fraction - cut discrete ] let @xmath55 be a set of @xmath58 points in @xmath13 in general position colored in colors @xmath59 so that : + ( i ) the number of points of each color is @xmath57 ; + ( ii ) for any directed line @xmath54 there exist two colors @xmath15 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 such that the farthest in the direction of @xmath54 point of color @xmath15 is not closer ( in the direction of @xmath54 ) than any point of color  @xmath60 .",
    "+ then there exists a _ balanced _ hyperplane @xmath62 , in other words , the hyperplane such that each half - space bounded by @xmath62 contains precisely the same number of points of each color .",
    "the proof follows almost directly from the continuous version .",
    "replace each point by a ball solid ball centered in it and of radius @xmath63 sufficiently small so that there is no hyperplane that intersects any @xmath0 balls at the same time and for any partition of points of @xmath42 by a hyperplane there exist a hyperplane that separates the corresponding balls accordingly .",
    "since the points are in general position such @xmath64 does exist .",
    "balls of each color generate an absolutely continuous measure .",
    "so we have @xmath0 absolutely continuous measures ; multiplying them by the same constant we make these measures probabilistic , denote them by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , ",
    ", @xmath5 .    now as in the proof of theorem [ thm : fraction - cut ] we consider charges @xmath65 and find a halfspace @xmath8 such that @xmath66    we will show that @xmath16 could not be less than @xmath67 for all @xmath15",
    ". suppose it is so .",
    "then again using equation we get : @xmath68    consider a line @xmath54 inner normal to @xmath8 and colors @xmath15 and @xmath60 from condition ( ii ) for this line .",
    "suppose @xmath69 .",
    "the hyperplane @xmath70 intersects at least two balls of color @xmath60 , otherwise the inequality would be @xmath71 by condition ( ii ) . under the above assumptions ,",
    "every hyperplane can pass through at most @xmath2 balls therefore there exist two colors @xmath72 and @xmath73 that do not intersect with @xmath70 and therefore with @xmath8 ( in the opposite case @xmath74 or @xmath75 would be at least @xmath67 ) .",
    "hence we have @xmath76 in contradiction with .",
    "so we for at least one @xmath15 the measure @xmath16 is at least @xmath67 .",
    "as @xmath42 goes to @xmath51 , the halfspace @xmath8 tends to a certain halfspace @xmath77 .",
    "its border hyperplane @xmath62 cuts equal positive fraction of every measure @xmath18 .    if @xmath62 touches no ball where the measures are concentrated then we are done . but",
    "a problem can occur if @xmath62 intersects some balls .",
    "since the points in @xmath55 are in general position , the hyperplane @xmath62 touches at most @xmath2 of them ( denote the corresponding subset of @xmath78 by @xmath79 ) and we can perturb @xmath62 so that arbitrary subset @xmath80 will be on one side of @xmath62 while @xmath81 will be on the other side of @xmath62 . thus we may `` round '' the fractions of the measure in any way we want and equalize the numbers of points in @xmath8 for all the colors ( compare with the proof of corollary 3.1.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "[ re : for fraction discrete ] as in remark [ re : not - permutation ] we can describe point sets satisfying condition ( ii ) in terms of permutations : for any directed line @xmath54 the order of points with least ( among the point of the same color ) projection to @xmath54 gives a permutation of colors @xmath17 ; a colored point set satisfies condition ( ii ) if and only if we can not get all permutations this way .",
    "let us give a simpler but still powerful sufficient assumption on @xmath55 :    [ cor : points - convex ] let @xmath55 be a set of @xmath58 points in @xmath13 in general position colored in colors @xmath59 so that : + ( i ) the number of points of each color is @xmath57 ; + ( ii ) points of one color lie in the convex hull of the union of points of other @xmath2 colors .",
    "+ then there exists a _ balanced _",
    "hyperplane @xmath62 .",
    "let us state another problem about cutting the same fraction of several measures :    [ prob : cutting - alpha ] the dimension @xmath2 and the number of measures @xmath82 are given .",
    "for which @xmath83 for any absolutely continuous probability measures @xmath4 , @xmath19 , @xmath84 on @xmath1 it is always possible to find a convex subset @xmath85 such that @xmath86    for @xmath87 and @xmath88 a positive solution to this problem follows from the ham sandwich theorem .",
    "if @xmath89 then considering two measures , one concentrated near the origin and the other concentrated uniformly near a unit sphere , we see that there is no solution .    if @xmath90 one can consider @xmath91 measures concentrated near the vertices of a simplex @xmath55 and the mass center @xmath92 of @xmath55 ; in this case any such @xmath93 must contain a neighborhood of @xmath92 and therefore can not cut @xmath94 of the corresponding measure .        [ cutting - one - kth ]",
    "suppose @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath19 , @xmath5 are absolutely continuous probability measures on @xmath1 and @xmath95 .",

    "first , we prove that it is possible if @xmath98 .",
    "following  @xcite it is sufficient to consider the case when @xmath73 is a prime and use induction . in this case",
    "we are going to apply  ( * ? ? ? * theorem  1.3 ) to these measures and the space of functions @xmath99 this space has dimension @xmath91 , which is sufficient to partition @xmath0 measures into equal parts by a generalized voronoi partition .",
    "recall that a generalized voronoi partition corresponding to an @xmath73-tuple of pairwise distinct functions @xmath100 is defined by @xmath101 assume without loss of generality that @xmath102 has the largest coefficient at @xmath103 among all @xmath104 .",
    "then the defining equations for @xmath105 will look like @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a linear function and @xmath108 is nonnegative . note that each of these equations defines either a halfspace or a ball and therefore their intersection @xmath105 is convex .",
    "let @xmath113 , @xmath114 be the points with coordinates @xmath115 and @xmath116 be the intervals with centers at @xmath113 an length @xmath117 .",

    "[ fig : two - dimension ] for the two - dimensional case .       to conclude the proof we note the following .",
    "assume that the measures @xmath18 are concentrated in @xmath131-neighborhoods of their respective vertices ( for @xmath132 ) or segments ( for @xmath133 ) .",
    "then going to the limit @xmath134 and using the blaschke selection theorem we assume that the corresponding @xmath135 tend in the hausdorff metric to some @xmath136 .",
