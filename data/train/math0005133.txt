    "growth processes have been extensively studied by mathematicians and physicists for many years ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , but it was only recently that k.  johansson  @xcite proved that the _ fluctuations _ of the limiting shape in a class of growth models are described by certain distribution functions first appearing in random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite .",
    "further work by johansson  @xcite , prhofer and spohn  @xcite and baik and rains  @xcite strongly suggests the universal nature of these rmt distribution functions .",
    "these developments are part of the recent activity relating robinson - schensted - knuth ( rsk ) type problems of combinatorial probability to the distribution functions of rmt , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we analyze a class of one - dimensional discrete space - discrete time stochastic growth models , called _ oriented digital boiling _",
    "digital boiling dynamics is a cellular automaton that models an excitable medium in the presence of persistent random spontaneous excitation . alternatively",
    ", digital boiling models represent contour ( constant height ) lines for one of the simplest models for growing a connected interface .",
    "it is this latter point of view we adopt here ; that is , we introduce a height function @xmath0 that characterizes the state of the system .",
    "[ fluctuationsfigs ] illustrates the height fluctuations in oriented digital boiling .",
    "we shall derive various limit theorems for @xmath0 .",
    "we find four limiting regimes :    1 .",
    "_ gue universal regime _ : @xmath3 , @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is fixed and @xmath6 .",
    "critical regime _ : @xmath3 , @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is fixed and @xmath7 .",
    "3 .   _ deterministic regime _ : @xmath3 , @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is fixed and @xmath8 .",
    "finite @xmath1 gue regime _ : fixed @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "the limit theorems are stated at the beginning of  3 . here is an outline of how they are obtained .",
    "first we show that @xmath0 satisfies a last passage property , i.e.  it equals the maximum over a certain class of paths in space - time .",
    "then applying the dual rsk algorithm  @xcite , we obtain a reformulation of the problem in terms of young tableaux .",
    "this is followed by an application of a theorem of gessel  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which gives a toeplitz determinant representation for the distribution function for @xmath0 .",
    "an identity of borodin and okounkov  @xcite expresses the toeplitz determinant in terms of the fredholm determinant of an infinite matrix .",
    "finally we use a saddle point analysis ( steepest descent ) to determinine the limiting behavior of the entries , and therefore the fredholm determinant , of the infinite matrix .    along the way we identify odb with a first - passage percolation model of sepplinen  @xcite",
    "whose limit law in the universal regime was determined by johansson  @xcite .",
    "thus we could have used the analysis in  @xcite to establish our limit law in the universal regime , or alternatively used riemann - hilbert methods @xcite , to investigate the toeplitz determinant asymptotics . but the method we present is in our opinion more straightforward and technically simpler than these , and it is very general .",
    "( the fredholm determinant is easier to handle than the toeplitz determinant , even though they are essentially equal . )",
    "also , our analysis permits a nice conceptual understanding of the various limiting regimes .",
    "for example , the universal regime is characterized by the coalescence of two saddle points ; and the emergence of the is related to the well - known appearance of airy functions in such a saddle point analysis  @xcite .    even in this simpler approach",
    "there are technical details to work out after the saddle point analysis gives us the answer .",
    "for example in the universal regime we need uniform estimates on the entries of the infinite matrix in order to show that the matrix scales in trace norm to the airy kernel .",
    "these details are given completely only for this regime .",
    "in regime 4 we give an independent proof that the suitably centered and normalized @xmath0 has a limiting distribution .",
    "the proof proceeds through the introduction of a certain brownian motion functional .",
    "this leads to some apparently new identities for @xmath9-dimensional brownian motion ; see ( [ distrfngue ] ) below .",
    "the initial conditions are corner initialization . due to the fact there is no known symmetry theorem for the _ dual _ rsk algorithm  @xcite , we are unable to prove limit theorems with different initial conditions , e.g.growth from a flat substrate . from work of baik and",
    "rains  @xcite and prhofer and spohn  @xcite , it is natural to conjecture that the limiting distribution is now of goe symmetry and hence given by the analogous distribution function in the goe case  @xcite .",
    "the table of contents provides a detailed description of the organization of this paper .",
    "in this section we introduce three classes of discrete space and discrete time stochastic growth models .",
    "each of these models will have an equivalent path description , but only for one of these models are we able to prove limit theorems .",
    "nevertheless , we believe it is useful to place this `` solvable '' case in a larger context .",
    "we assume that the occupied set of our growth models can be described by a _",
    "height function _",
    "@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the set of nonnegative integers . here ,",
    "time @xmath12 proceeds in discrete steps .",
