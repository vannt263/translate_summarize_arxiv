    "the number counts in a bin of mass @xmath1 and redshift @xmath2 , can be considered as a monopole of the halo density field : _ ( i_m , i_z ) = _ ( i_m , i_z ) + ^2 m z r^2 _ ( = r| m , z ) cluster counts have been shown as a powerful probe of cosmology , e.g. @xcite has produced constraint on @xmath3 and @xmath4 with sz detected clusters .",
    "the study of the clustering of galaxies may be done with the angular correlation function @xmath5 or its harmonic transform @xmath6 , in tomographic redshift bins  : c_^(i_z , j_z ) = k^2 k j_(k r_1 ) j_(k r_2 ) p_(k | z_1,z_2 ) in the following i use @xmath6 instead of @xmath5 for simpler equations , although they can be related by a simple linear transformation .",
    "the cross covariance between these two probes involves the halo - galaxy - galaxy angular bispectrum in the squeezed limit @xcite  : ( _ ( i_m , i_z ) , c_^(j_z , k_z ) ) = .|_m_1,z_1 b_0^hgg(m_1,z_123 ) @xmath7 is a projection of the 3d bispectrum , for which we need a non - linear model . in the framework of the halo model + hod ,",
    "i have shown that the bispectrum ( or higher orders ) can be computed with a diagrammatic formalism @xcite .",
    "see the diagrams for this hgg bispectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "i have shown that the equations for the covariance can be rewritten in terms of effective quantities , e.g. @xcite  : _ ( _ ( i_m , i_z ) , c_^(j_z , k_z ) ) & = 4 f _ b_1^(k_,z_2)^2 + & b_1^(i_m , z_1 ) p_(k_,z_2 ) _",
    "0,p(z_1,z_2 ) these intermediate quantities are integrated over the halo mass and contain the hod and mass function dependency .",
    "they can be compared to measurement on data or to other modeling , providing the possibility for some model independence .",
    "i have built a fast and efficient code to compute the different terms of the covariance ; the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov ] illustrate the numerical results .",
    "we see that different terms can become important depending on mass and redshift .",
    "the code runs in @xmath8 cpu - second , and is thus adequate to be integrated into an mcmc pipeline .",
    "cluster counts follow a poissonian distribution ( up to sample variance ) , thus one can not assume that the joint likelihood of @xmath9 is gaussian .",
    "+ to tackle this , i expanded the joint likelihood with the gram - charlier series , around a fiducial independent case .",
    "i am then able to resum the expansion into @xcite  : ( x ) =  ( ) ( w ) this analytic form is well - behaved ( positive ) , can be extended straightforwardly to include sample variance , and has correct asymptotic behaviour at large @xmath10 ( gaussian with the correct covariance matrix ) .",
    "hyperparameters ( hps ) allow to detect over / underestimation of error bars , or inconsistencies between data sets @xcite .",
    "the method is at the moment only adapted to gaussian distributions , thus not for poissonian cluster counts .",
    "it is however mathematically impossible to keep the gaussian properties of hps in the poissonian case ( that is , rescaling the variance while keeping the mean ) .",
    "however i found a prescription which approximately respect them . on fig .",
    "[ fig : poissonhp ] are shown three pdfs , corresponding to three different values of the bayesian hp @xmath11 . +",
    "this will allow the use of hps for the cluster counts - galaxy 2-pt combination , after further extension ( sample variance , correlation with @xmath12 as treated in sect .",
    "[ sect : jointlikely ] ) .",
    "i sketched how to combine cluster counts and galaxy 2-pt measurements for increased cosmological constraints , from the physical modeling to the likelihood . in the context of the halo model ,",
    "i introduced a diagrammatic method allowing elegant computation of the equations involved .",
    "i derived a non - gaussian joint likelihood using gram - charlier series , and showed how to introduce bayesian hps to a poissonian distribution .",
    "further work will be necessary to include experimental effects in the covariance and the likelihood : photo - z errors , purity ... next order derivation of the joint likelihood may also be necessary to solve a small bias issue at low @xmath10 , and the bayesian hyperparameters method need to be extended to cluster sample variance and correlation with galaxies . in the medium term",
    ", i aim to build a full mcmc pipeline of cluster - galaxy combination , for realistic forecasts and application to des data .",
