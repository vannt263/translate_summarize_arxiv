    "it is obvious that the results for the differential cross section given by eq .",

    "it is therefore clear that precise measurements of the asymmetry @xmath131 in these collisions will be useful not only in parameterizing boer - mulders function but also in studying the nuclear dependence .",
    "the accuracy of the data@xcite available is however still too low to draw any decisive judgment on the @xmath33 dependence of the asymmetry .",
    "nevertheless , it is encouraging to see that such measurements can indeed be carried out and more measurements are planned @xcite .",
    "within the framework of the tmd factorization , the nuclear dependence of the azimuthal asymmetry in polarized dy processes has been studied .",
    "we find the nuclear modifications of the azimuthal asymmetries @xmath58 and @xmath66 are the same and very similar to the azimuthal asymmetries @xmath58 in sidis obtained in ref .",
    "the nuclear effects of the azimuthal asymmetries @xmath60 and @xmath134 are the same and similar to the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath127 in sidis obtained in ref . @xcite . among all the azimuthal asymmetries we have considered , the nuclear dependence of the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath135 is most suppressed .",
    "the nuclear modification of the azimuthal asymmetry and its nontrivial transverse momentum dependence provides a very sensitive probe to measure the width of the transverse momentum distribution in the tmd quark distribution functions .",
