    "we started from a previous analysis @xcite of hadronic transverse mass and rapidity distributions from @xmath0 s+s collisions to estimate the maximum information content a hydrodynamic analysis can possibly deliver . using all available information on both the initial conditions as well as the freeze - out conditions",
    ", we still can not determine the initial longitudinal flow , or equivalently , the initial energy density .",
    "however , we find that regardless of the initial flow all possible initial conditions finally lead to the same temperature and transverse flow at freeze - out , which we model with a dynamical freeze - out criterium .",
    "this is apparently a consequence of the dynamical freeze - out in conjunction with the transverse expansion , which in the late stages of hydrodynamics proves to be much more important for the rarefaction than the longitudinal expansion .    a comparison with our phenomenological flow analysis shows then good agreement with the data for a wide variety of initial conditions and freeze - out criteria .",
    "however , while both hadron resonance gas and plasma equation of state produce good agreement with the data , a purely pionic equation of state generates too much transverse flow and can thus be excluded for all hydrodynamic initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , from the fact that the data show a lower number of strange particles than our model with chemical equilibrium would produce , we deduce that chemical equilibration has not been reached . on the other hand",
    "we determine that the chemical non - equilibrium of pions is not as big as to allow for a @xmath6 close to the pion mass , we estimate instead @xmath9 .      e.  s.  gratefully acknowledges support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) , the alexander - von - humboldt stiftung and the u.s .",

    "<S> we are analyzing the hydrodynamics of @xmath0 s+s collisions using a new approach which tries to quantify the uncertainties arising from the specific implementation of the hydrodynamical model . based on a previous phenomenological analysis we use the global hydrodynamics model to show that the amount of initial flow , or initial energy density , can not be determined from the hadronic momentum spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we additionally find that almost always a sizeable transverse flow develops , which causes the system to freeze out , thereby limiting the flow velocity in itself . </S>",
    "<S> this freeze - out dominance in turn makes a distinction between a plasma and a hadron resonance gas equation of state very difficult , whereas a pure pion gas can easily be ruled out from present data . to complete the picture </S>",
