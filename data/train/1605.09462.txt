    "it is not generally trivial to find a tight theoretical penalty bound for a given optimization problem .",
    "moreover , a penalty bound that is sufficiently large for a given instance of a problem is often much smaller than the theoretical penalty bound .    one may view quantum annealing as a physical implementation of a heuristic evolution . as such , the appearance of terms that are different in orders of magnitude may create objective functions that are difficult for the quantum annealer to explore .",
    "the several sources of noise ( elaborated upon in section [ sec : prelim - aqc ] ) of quantum annealing hardware is an added reason of inconvenience of such objective functions .",

    "as the algorithm proceeds , @xmath132 approaches 0 , and @xmath206 may get larger , so the ratio @xmath207 can jump to large values .",
    "whereas this happens for the newtonian method , the modified variant of this method avoids this problem because the best objective value observed for a feasible solution @xmath151 also improves , so @xmath208 stays minimal .",
    "since the chimera graph is very sparse , problem instances in which the connectivity of @xmath209 is a subgraph of the chimera graph are similarly sparse and often disconnected",
    ". therefore , random test instances of the gqss problem that are native to the chimera graph are not sufficiently difficult for the purpose of our experiment .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the performance of the outer approximation method of @xcite for the gqss problem is similar to the penalty methods . in the outer approximation method ,",
    "a linear programming ( lp ) problem is initialized with a set of sufficiently large bounds ( box constraints ) on the lagrangian multipliers ; iteratively , the solution of the lp problem is employed to form , and , based on the solution of , a linear constraint ( cut ) is added to the lp problem ; this procedure is terminated when no new cuts are generated . for the gqss problem , to ensure that outer approximation returns the lagrangian dual bound ( instead of a looser lower bound ) , the box constraint must be as large as the theoretical penalty value .",
    "the lagrangian relaxation with this multiplier is the first ( and only ) slave unconstrained problem solved , and , consequently , the success of this method is the same as that of the penalty methods .",
    "therefore , @xcite does not overcome the deficiencies of the penalty methods when working with noisy quantum annealers .",
    "strong duality holds for the gqss problem ; thus , the subgradient method may be viewed as a technique for finding smaller penalty coefficients that are instance dependent . in general ,",
    "strong duality does not hold for a constrained binary quadratic problem .",
    "similar to the idea presented in @xcite , we may employ the subgradient descent method within a branch - and - bound framework as a bounding procedure to solve a general constrained binary quadratic programming problem .",
    "however , missing the optimal solution can occasionally break the branch - and - bound framework by obtaining an incorrect bound based on a suboptimal solution . a suitable recovery scheme , or",
    "a guarantee for checking the optimality of a solution , is needed to successfully employ any of these methods in a branch - and - bound framework .",

    "<S> an earlier work @xcite proposes a method for solving the lagrangian dual of a constrained binary quadratic programming problem via quantum adiabatic evolution using an outer approximation method . </S>",
    "<S> this should be an efficient prescription for solving the lagrangian dual problem in the presence of an ideally noise - free quantum adiabatic system . </S>",
    "<S> however , current implementations of quantum annealing systems demand methods that are efficient at handling possible sources of noise . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a subgradient method for finding an optimal primal - dual pair for the lagrangian dual of a constrained binary polynomial programming problem . </S>",
    "<S> we then study the quadratic stable set ( qss ) problem as a case study . </S>",
    "<S> we see that this method applied to the qss problem can be viewed as an instance - dependent penalty - term approach that avoids large penalty coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we report our experimental results of using the d - wave 2x quantum annealer and conclude that our approach helps this quantum processor to succeed more often in solving these problems compared to the usual penalty - term approaches . </S>"
