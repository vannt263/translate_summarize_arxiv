    "according to the standard model of cosmology , the total energy density of the universe is presently dominated by two component densities : the _ dark matter _ component , which is a pressureless matter fluid having attracting gravitational effects , and _ dark energy _ , whose main properties are a negative pressure and a nearly constant energy density today , which evoke the idea of vacuum energy .",
    "the nature of both components remains unknown , and in the near future we can hope that the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will be able to provide hints on the nature of dark matter . in spite of the mysteries of the dark components , it is generally considered that dark matter can be modeled as a system of collisionless particles , whereas the most usual models of dark energy are the scalar field based quintessence models .",
    "nevertheless , many difficulties in usual dark energy and dark matter models still cast doubts on the cosmological standard model bases , leaving room for other models to be investigated . here",
    "we consider a unifying model in which the dark matter and dark energy components can be considered as two different aspects of a same component , the _",
    "dark fluid_. we will first review how such a unifying model can be constrained by the cosmological observations .",
    "then we will consider a dark fluid model based on a complex scalar field , and we will discuss the question of the choice of the scalar field potential through an analysis of quantum corrections .",
    "during past years , cosmological observations have greatly improved in precision and increased in number .",
    "the data analysis are generally performed within the standard model of cosmology , considering distinctly dark matter and dark energy .",
    "these results have been reinterpreted to constrain dark fluid models in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an analysis in the light of the new 5-year wmap constraints @xcite has been performed in @xcite .",
    "we review here some of the obtained results .",
    "first we define the usual ratio @xmath0 of the density of the dark fluid over the critical density , and @xmath1 the ratio of the pressure of the dark fluid over its density : @xmath2 recent observations of supernov  of type ia impose the following constraints on the dark fluid @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath1 is written in function of the expansion factor : @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "the result on @xmath6 is particularly interesting , as it reveals that @xmath7 , which is a property that has to be fulfilled in order for the dark fluid to be described by a scalar field .",
    "studying structure formation is also a useful way to constrain cosmological models .",
    "however , no stringent constraints can be determined without performing a precise analysis of a specific dark fluid model .",
    "we have nevertheless shown in @xcite that a dark fluid should have an equation of state respecting @xmath8 at the time of structure formation .",
    "the data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have been greatly improved with the new wmap 5-year data . if only the cmb data are considered , a large variety of dark fluid models would still be allowed .",
    "we can however consider that a dark fluid model is more realistic if the fluid behaves today like a dark energy with a negative pressure , but was behaving mainly like matter at the recombination time .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed analysis of the cmb constraints .",
    "constraints can also be derived considering primordial nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) models .",
    "we use the parametrization described in @xcite for @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the bbn temperature , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the ratio of the dark fluid density over the radiation density at bbn time . in order to make a realistic analysis of the allowed cosmological scenarios , we used a modified version of the bbn abundance calculation code nuc123 @xcite including the parametrization ( [ rhod ] ) to compute the relevant abundances of the elements .",
    "we consider the rather conservative bounds of @xcite : @xmath14 for the helium abundance @xmath15 and the primordial @xmath16 ratio . in fig .",
    "[ bbn ] , the current limits on the dark fluid properties from the @xmath15 and @xmath17 bbn constraints are presented .",
    "the area between the back lines on the left plot and the area on the top of the black lines on the right plot lead to unfavored element abundances .",
    "( left ) and @xmath17 ( right ) on the dark fluid parameters @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter regions excluded by bbn are located between the black lines for @xmath15 , and in the upper left corner for @xmath17 .",
    "the colors correspond to different values of @xmath15 and @xmath17.[bbn],title=\"fig:\",width=304 ] ( left ) and @xmath17 ( right ) on the dark fluid parameters @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter regions excluded by bbn are located between the black lines for @xmath15 , and in the upper left corner for @xmath17 .",
    "the colors correspond to different values of @xmath15 and @xmath17.[bbn],title=\"fig:\",width=304 ]    a consequence is that if the dark fluid density were small before bbn , the dark fluid model could be compatible with bbn constraints .",
    "taken separately , these constraints does not seem very severe , but in a complete dark fluid scenario , all of them must be satisfied simultaneously , and when requiring that the dark fluid should also be able to explain dark matter at local scales , they become very restrictive .    in the following we will consider a dark fluid model based on a complex scalar field and confront it to the observational constraints .",
    "modeling a dark fluid is not an easy task , because such a model should describe simultaneously dark matter and dark energy properties . in the literature ,",
    "only a few dark fluid type models have been investigated , the most well - known one being the chaplygin gas ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we consider here a particular model using a scalar field , which was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "dark energy shares with vacuum energy the property of having a negative pressure and a quasi - constant energy density .",
    "therefore , a standard scalar field is often referred as a good candidate for dark energy , and models of dark energy based on scalar fields are generally referred as quintessence scalar fields @xcite .",
    "an important issue in these models is the choice of the potential of the scalar field , as it completely determines the behaviour of the field throughout the expansion of the universe .",
    "many potentials have already been investigated , and some of them , such as the decreasing exponential potential , have been already excluded by the cosmological data .",
    "however , it is still unclear how to choose the potential , but it is desirable to use potentials which can originate from physically motivated theories .",
    "the same problem appears when trying to build a dark fluid model .",
    "the potential choice is however more constrained for the dark fluid model , as the scalar field has to behave matter - like at local scale to account for observations in galaxies and clusters , and dark energy - like at cosmological scales . in @xcite",
    "we have already shown that it is possible to describe dark matter in galaxies and at cosmological scales using a complex scalar field , provided the scalar field potential has a mass term .",
    "we have shown in particular that with a model based on a complex scalar field @xmath19 with an internal rotation @xmath20 and based on the lagrangian density : @xmath21 associated to a quadratic potential @xmath22 , flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies as well as rotation curves of dwarf spirals can be reproduced , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gal ] . to retain the dark matter behaviour",
    ", we will consider a dark fluid potential with a @xmath23 term .",
    "scalar fields have shown a great versatility , as they can lead to both a dark energy behaviour and a matter behaviour .",
    "therefore , it is quite natural to model a dark fluid using also a scalar field . however , an important question remains : how can the behaviour of the dark fluid be similar to dark matter at local scales and similar to dark energy at cosmological scales ? recalling that the density of dark fluid at cosmological scales today is of the order of the critical density , i.e. @xmath24 , and that the average matter density in galaxies is of the order @xmath25 , a way out would be to consider that the dark fluid is inhomogeneous .    in @xcite ,",
    "the dark fluid model using the potential @xmath26 was investigated .",
    "this potential is composed of a quadratic term giving a mass to the field , and mostly responsible for the dark matter behaviour , and a decreasing exponential part , which can originate from high energy theories and recalls quintessence potentials , responsible for the dark energy behaviour . in the regions of spacetime where the scalar field density is large enough , for example around galaxies or in the early universe , the quadratic part of the potential would dominate , and where the density is small , the second part of the potential dominates , leading to a repulsive vacuum energy - like behaviour .",
    "thus , such a potential leads to a universe highly inhomogeneous today .",
    "it was also shown that such a potential can lead to the cosmological behaviour illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cosmo ] , which is consistent with the observations , provided the different parameters are chosen adequately .",
    "to fix the parameters , we consider three scales : the mass @xmath27 is fixed by galaxy scales , confronting the model predictions to galaxy rotation curves ; the @xmath28 parameter is fixed in order for the field to behave mostly as dark matter at typical cluster scales ; and @xmath29 is chosen in order for the field to be consistent with the cosmological observations revealing a dark energy behaviour .",
    "we obtain @xmath30 ev , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . with this choice of parameters ,",
    "the scalar field dark fluid model is able to reproduce galaxy rotation curves , to condense at cluster scales , and to have today a negative pressure at cosmological scales .",
    "the question of the choice of the potential remains crucial .",
    "we would like it to be motivated by physics , and to originate if possible from high energy theories . to investigate the behaviour of the scalar field from the quantum physics point of view , we used in @xcite an effective quantum field theory approach to determine how quantum fluctuations would affect the potential of eq .",

    "the cosmological action is written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the associated lagrangian density .",
    "we consider that the lagrangian contains a curvature term leading to einstein equations , a term involving scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity , and a term containing fermions potentially coupled to the scalar fields @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath35 the curvature lagrangian is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the planck mass and @xmath38 the curvature tensor . for a model containing a complex scalar field @xmath39 ,",

    "for this reason , even if many of the cosmological potentials are non - renormalizable in the strict sense of field theory , we can consider that the cosmological potentials are renormalizable as the higher order terms are so small .",

    "we can however note that at earlier epochs , as @xmath88 was larger , this term was suppressed by the exponential .",
    "a way to solve this problem would be to modify the potential such as : @xmath89 in this case , the effective potential reads : @xmath90 \\exp(-\\beta \\phi_{cl}^\\dagger\\phi_{cl})\\nonumber\\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constant term is irrelevant . with two redefinitions :",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 , the correction terms of the second line vanish , but the last correction term of the first line still remains and modifies the shape of the potential .",
    "however , for @xmath93 , this term is negligible in comparison to the other terms , and the shape of the potential is then conserved .",
    "if @xmath94 and @xmath28 is small in comparison to @xmath95 , the analysis of @xcite remains valid . in the case of a larger @xmath28",

    ", the corrections can be reabsorbed into the constants @xmath99 , and the last correction of order @xmath100 will be negligible today in comparison to the other terms . also , such a potential would lead to a behaviour similar to that described in @xcite , provided the redefined terms @xmath101 ( for @xmath102 ) are today small in comparison to @xmath103 .",
    "we will now consider the corrections due to the coupling of the scalar fields to fermions .",

    "thus , as noticed in @xcite , the only way that the fermionic corrections do not strongly modify the potential is that @xmath75 ^ 2 $ ] takes a form which is already contained in the classical potential , and can therefore be reabsorbed in the constants of the potential .",

    "we now consider the case where the coupling is not of the shape of the potential , and where the one - loop corrections can not be reabsorbed by higher order corrections .",

    "thus , the global potential has a similar structure if @xmath115 for a present value of the potential such as @xmath107 , this leads to a limit on the present value of @xmath116 : @xmath117 this limit is so stringent that it nearly forbids a dependence of the mass on @xmath118 if the shape of the coupling is different from the shape of the potential .",
    "this result is similar for the quintessence potentials , and is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we however have to notice that as we restricted ourselves to one - loop corrections , this limit has to be interpreted with reserve , as the higher order corrections could also modify the structure of the effective potential .",
    "we have shown that the original potential ( [ df1 ] ) would be modified by quantum fluctuations , especially if we expect it to be somehow non - minimally coupled to matter fields .",
    "this result can be understood in two different manners : either such a potential is not resistant to quantum fluctuation and is not viable from the quantum theory point of view , or it is an effective potential which already includes the quantum corrections .",
    "the standard model of cosmology assumes the existence of two unknown dark components , dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we have seen that it is possible to replace both components with a unique component , the dark fluid , and be consistent with the cosmological data .",
    "the properties of the dark fluid are severely constrained because of the dual dark energy / dark matter conditions , but it is nevertheless possible to model the dark fluid with a simple and usual complex scalar field . the main question of the model is the choice of the scalar field potential .",
    "an adequate choice can lead to a fluid explaining at the same time the dark matter observations at local scales , and the dark energy behaviour at cosmological scales .",
    "the possibility that a dark fluid can lead to a correct structure formation has still to be tested , and methods to simulate scalar field condensation are being developed @xcite .",
    "however , the relations between such a model and quantum theories are not obvious , and still need to be worked out . in this context , a new interesting potential is currently under investigation : @xmath119 it has the advantage of finding roots in brane theories , and yet no big difference in behaviour is expected from the one determined by the potential in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) . another way to find",
    "an adequate potential would be to study the possibility of an even larger unification , _",
