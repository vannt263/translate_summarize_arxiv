    "mesons with exotic properties play an important role in understanding the nature of strong interactions .",
    "the observation of the so called xyz states in the heavy quark sector has triggered lots of discussions on their quark structures , decays , and formation mechanisms .",
    "it also motivates people to study new states beyond the quark model assignments .    the x(3872 ) , first observed in the @xmath12 invariant mass distribution by belle collaboration in 2003 @xcite , is the strangest heavy quark state .",
    "even now , its angular momentum is not determined . since its extreme closeness to the @xmath13 threshold ,",
    "lots of discussions about its properties are based on the molecule assumption . however , it is very difficult to identify the x(3872 ) as a shallow bound state of @xmath13 since there are no explicitly exotic molecule properties .",
    "a charged charmonium- or bottomonium - like meson labeled as @xmath14 is absolutely exotic because its number of quarks and antiquarks must be four or more .",
    "such states include the @xmath15 observed in the @xmath16 mass distribution @xcite , the @xmath17 and @xmath18 observed in the @xmath19 mass distribution @xcite , and the @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the mass spectra of the @xmath22 ( @xmath23=1,2,3 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25=1,2 ) @xcite .",
    "they are all observed by belle collaboration . though babar has not confirmed them @xcite , the existence signal of multiquark states is still exciting .",
    "since @xmath15 is around the @xmath26 threshold , @xmath20 is around the @xmath27 threshold , and @xmath21 is around the @xmath28 threshold , molecular models seem to be applicable to their structure investigations @xcite .    to identify a state as a molecule is an important issue in hadron studies .",
    "one should consider not only bound state problem of two hadrons , but also how to observe a molecular state in possible production processes . in refs .",
    "@xcite , bound states of @xmath29 and @xmath30 were studied . since the quantum numbers are the same as the nucleon but the masses are much higher , identifying them as multiquark baryons is rather apparent . to obtain a deeper understanding of the strong interaction ,",
    "it is necessary to explore possible molecules with explicitly exotic quantum numbers .",
    "quark model gives us a constraint on the quantum numbers of a meson , namely , a meson with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath11 , @xmath35 could not be a @xmath36 state , but it may be a multiquark state .",
    "so the study on such states may deepen our understanding of nature .",
    "if two @xmath36 mesons can form a molecule with such quantum numbers , one gets the simplest configuration . next",
    "simpler configuration is the baryon - antibaryon case .",
    "a possible place to search for them is around hadron - hadron thresholds .",
    "there are some discussions on low spin heavy quark exotic states in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we would like to discuss the possibility of a higher spin state , @xmath0 .",
    "one will see that identification of it from strong decay is possible .",
    "first , we check meson - antimeson systems that can form @xmath11 states , where meson ( antimeson ) means that its quark structure is @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the established mesons may be found in the particle data book @xcite .",
    "one checks various combinations and finds that the lowest s - wave system is @xmath2 .",
    "the next s - wave one is @xmath39 . between these two thresholds",
    ", one needs @xmath40 or @xmath41 wave to combine other meson - antimeson pairs ( see fig .",
    "[ th3- ] ) . below the threshold of @xmath2 ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum is @xmath40 , @xmath42 , or @xmath41-wave . above the @xmath39 threshold ,",
    "a partial wave of @xmath43 , @xmath42 , or @xmath44 is needed .",
    "since the difference between these two thresholds is more than 200 mev , one may neglect the channel coupling and choose the @xmath45 system to study .",
    "meson - antimeson systems between that of @xmath45 and that of @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath47 are orbital angular momenta . ]",
    "secondly , we check baryon - antibaryon systems .",
    "if one combines the established @xmath48 baryons and their antibaryons , one finds that the lowest s - wave threshold is for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 mev ) . even for the lowest threshold of @xmath52 and @xmath50 in f - wave ,",
    "the value ( @xmath53 mev ) is still higher than that of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we may safely ignore the possible baryon - antibaryon contributions in this study .    in a @xmath11 @xmath2 state , partial waves of @xmath46 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath47 may all contribute .",
    "as a first step exploration , we consider only the dominant s - wave interactions .",
    "possible coupled channel effects will be deferred to future works .",
    "the present study is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , we present the main ingredients for our study in sec .",
    "then we give the numerical results in sec .",
    "the final part is for discussions and conclusions .",
    "we study the meson - antimeson bound state problem in a meson exchange model .",
    "the potential is derived from the scattering amplitudes @xcite and the flavor wave functions of the system are necessary . since the states we are discussing have a definite c - parity while the combination of @xmath37 and @xmath38 mesons does not , a relative sign problem arises between the two parts of a flavor wave function .",
    "one has to find the relation between the flavor wave function and the potential with definite c - parity .",
    "there are some discussions about this problem in the literatures @xcite . here",
    "we revisit it by using the g - parity transformation rule which relates the amplitudes between @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath40 mesons do not have defined c - parity , we may assume arbitrary complex phases @xmath56 and @xmath57 under the c - parity transformations @xmath58 according to the su(2 ) transformation , one finds the following isospin doublets @xmath59 from which the g - parity transformations read @xmath60    similar to the study of the @xmath61 bound state problem @xcite , one may construct several states from @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "here we concentrate only on the @xmath1 case .",
    "if the system is an isovector ( isoscalar ) , we label it @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) where @xmath66 is the angular momentum .",
    "explicitly , one has the g - parity eigenstates @xmath67,\\nonumber\\\\ x_j^0&=&\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt2}\\big[(d^{*-}d_2^{*+}+d_2^{*+}d^{*-})+\\beta_1^\\dag\\beta_2(\\bar{d}^{*0}d_2^{*0}+d_2^{*0}\\bar{d}^{*0})\\nonumber\\\\ & & + c\\alpha_1\\beta_1^\\dag ( d_2^{*-}d^{*+}+d^{*+}d_2^{*-})+c\\alpha_2\\beta_1^\\dag(\\bar{d}_2^{*0}d^{*0}+d^{*0}\\bar{d}_2^{*0})\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the c - parity and the superscript indicates the electric charge .",

    "<S> motivated by the observation of several molecule candidates in the heavy quark sector , we discuss the possibility of a state with @xmath0 . in a one - boson - exchange model investigation for the s wave @xmath1 @xmath2 states , one finds that the strongest attraction is in the case @xmath3 and @xmath4 for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> numerical analysis indicates that this hadronic bound state may exist . </S>",
    "<S> if a state around the @xmath2 threshold ( @xmath74472 mev ) in the channel @xmath8 ( p wave ) is observed , the heavy quark spin symmetry implies that it is not a @xmath9 meson and the @xmath10 are very likely to be @xmath11 . </S>"
