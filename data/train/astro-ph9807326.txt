    "measuring accurate and reliable distances is a critical part of the quest to measure the hubble constant @xmath6 . until recently , different techniques for estimating extragalactic distances produced results that differed by as much as a factor of two , while the statistical uncertainties of individual techniques were much smaller .",
    "identifying and removing systematic errors from distance measurements has been a difficult and lengthy process , but progress is now being made on a number of fronts towards resolving discrepancies in distance measurements .",
    "detailed summaries of many different distance measurement techniques are found in the reviews by jacoby et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and in the proceedings of a recent symposium on the extragalactic distance scale ( livio , donahue , & panagia 1997 ) .    reliably determining @xmath6 also requires the measurement of accurate radial velocities . in the local universe ,",
    "peculiar velocities are larger than the hubble flow we must measure . to avoid this problem , we must accurately measure distances great enough that local velocity perturbations are negligible .",
    "recently , however , several studies have measured residual velocities on uncomfortably large scales ( lynden - bell et al .",
    "1988 ; mould et al .",
    "1991 ; mathewson , ford , & buchhorn 1992 ; lauer & postman 1994 ) large - scale motions are difficult to explain with standard models of hierarchical structure formation , so it is crucial to our understanding of cosmology that we confirm the reality of such large flows with accurate distance measurements .",
    "large - scale motions can also bias measurements of @xmath6 so it is important that accurate distances be measured to galaxies in many directions and to distances beyond 10,000",
    ".    surface brightness fluctuations ( sbfs ) have proven to be a remarkably accurate distance indicator ( tonry et al .",
    "ground - based optical sbfs reach @xmath8 ; ir sbfs are some 30 times brighter than optical fluctuations , and can potentially reach much greater distances .",
    "we explored the advantages of measuring sbfs in the  band ( 2.1 ) and calibrated the  sbf distance scale ( jensen , tonry , & luppino 1998 , hereafter jtl ; jensen , luppino , & tonry 1996 ) . from these studies",
    "we learned that it is important to account for the contributions to the ir sbfs from globular clusters and background galaxies .",
    "jtl and jensen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also concluded that residual noise in ir images that is correlated from pixel to pixel can dominate sbfs when the ratio of signal to noise ( @xmath9 ) is small .",
    "this paper presents measurements of the  sbf distances to ngc  3309 and ngc  3311 in the hydra cluster and to ngc  4889 in the coma cluster to establish ir sbf as a technique useful to @xmath10 .",
    "this is the first step towards an accurate measurement of the ir sbf hubble constant and a better determination of peculiar velocities on scales of @xmath11 . at 7000 ,",
    "the peculiar velocity of the coma cluster should be less than 10% of its hubble velocity . at half the distance to coma , sbf measurements of hydra cluster galaxies",
    "can be used to test our techniques and to confirm the reliability of the more distant coma measurements .",
    "tully - fisher and @xmath12 distance measurements both show hydra to be nearly at rest with respect to the hubble flow ( han & mould 1992 ; faber et al .",
    "1989 ) , so we can use the distance to hydra to confirm the coma cluster determination of @xmath6 .",
    "the data described in this paper were obtained using the university of hawaii 2.24  m telescope on 1996 march 1 and april 2528 .",
    "we used the new science - grade `` hawaii '' infrared array , a 1024@xmath13-pixel hgcdte detector mounted in the quirc camera ( hodapp et al .",
    "1996 ) . at f/10",
    ", quirc has a pixel scale of 01886  pixel@xmath5 , producing a field of view 32 on a side .",
    "we observed using the university of hawaii  filter centered at 2.1 , which is much less sensitive to the thermal background than the standard @xmath14 filter ( wainscoat & cowie 1992 ) .",
    "conditions on these nights were photometric and the seeing at  averaged 075 fwhm .",
    "the dark current of the array was less than 1   and the correlated double - sample read noise was @xmath15 e@xmath16 .",
    "the banded sensitivity patterns and anomalous dark current features common in earlier ir arrays have been reduced significantly in the new hawaii device .",
    "in addition , the new array has far fewer bad pixels ( @xmath17 ) and higher quantum efficiency than previous ir arrays .",
    "the dark current in this device is locally sensitive to bright objects , and residual images of bright or saturated objects persist for several minutes .",
    "individual integration times were kept short enough to prevent the centers of the galaxies from approaching saturation , and sky frames were acquired after every galaxy image .",

    "k corrections were computed for the redshifts of the coma and hydra clusters by computing @xmath14-band fluctuation magnitudes for model stellar populations at redshifts in the range @xmath34 .",
    "we used the k corrections listed in table  6 of jtl , computed using the stellar population models from worthey ( 1994 ) and g. worthey ( 1997 , private communication ) assuming a metallicity of [ fe / h]=0 . for the coma cluster at @xmath35 ,",

    "the first step in the image reduction procedure was to create an average sky image .",
    "we masked stars and galaxies in individual sky frames before averaging 5 to 7 images to form a sky image .",
    "individual exposures were 120  s , so a stack of 7 sky frames spans about 30 minutes of observing time , which is roughly the time scale over which variations in sky brightness typically begin to be significant .",
    "next , an average sky image was subtracted from each galaxy frame prior to dividing by a normalized flat field image .",
    "dark current is subtracted along with the sky background .",
    "cosmic rays were then removed from each image . finally , the cleaned images were registered to the nearest pixel and good pixels averaged to form the final galaxy image .",
    "sub - pixel registration was not used because it modifies the noise characteristics of the background , introducing correlations in the noise between pixels that were uncorrelated in the individual images .",
    "the registered  images are displayed in figures  1 and 2 .",
    "because the sky level changes on short time scales , sky subtraction left a non - zero background level that we measured and removed .",
    "we assumed the residual sky offset was constant across the field of view and applied a simple offset correction .",
    "the galaxies we observed are large and fill most of the field of view",
    ". to determine the residual sky level , we fitted a devaucouleurs @xmath37 profile to the surface brightness of the galaxy measured in elliptical annuli .",
    "we then adjusted the background level to minimize the deviation from an @xmath37 profile .",
    "the residual sky corrections listed in table  [ photdata ] were applied before proceeding with the sbf analysis .",
    "the techniques for measuring distances using sbfs were first laid out by tonry & schneider ( 1988 ) . the procedures used to measure sbfs in this study are the same as those presented in detail by jtl .",
    "we summarize only the principal steps here .",
    "first we fitted a smooth model to the galaxy surface brightness after the residual sky brightness had been subtracted .",
    "extraneous objects were masked before fitting .",
    "after the galaxy had been fitted , subtracted , and compact sources masked , residual large - scale variations were fitted and subtracted .",
    "the masked residual image was then fourier transformed and the two - dimensional power spectrum computed .",
    "the power spectrum is the convolution of the stellar sbfs with an expectation power spectrum , which includes the normalized power spectrum of the point spread function ( psf ) , the galaxy surface brightness profile , and the power spectrum of the mask .",
    "the details of the procedure are described by jtl .",
    "the power spectrum was fitted with the sum of the sbf power @xmath38 multiplied by the expectation power spectrum and a white noise component @xmath39 .",
    "we measured @xmath38 in annular regions centered on the galaxy .",
    "the contribution to the fluctuation power from undetected gcs and background galaxies ( @xmath40 ) was estimated and subtracted from @xmath38 . the residual spatial variance ( @xmath41 ) remaining after subtracting the bright background and galaxy",
    "was also estimated and subtracted from @xmath38 .",
    "the methods we used to determine @xmath40 and @xmath41 are described in detail below and by jtl .",
    "the fluctuation magnitude is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath38 is the sbf power in and @xmath18 is the magnitude of a source yielding one  at zero air mass .    to determine the size of the contribution to the stellar sbfs from undetected gcs and background galaxies @xmath40 , we first measured the magnitudes of all the objects in the image .",
    "gc and galaxy luminosity functions were fitted as a function of radius from the center of the galaxy ( as described by jtl ) .",
    "objects brighter than the completeness limit were masked , and we integrated the luminosity functions beyond the completeness cutoff to compute the numbers of faint unmasked gcs and galaxies that add variance to @xmath38 .",
    "the size of the @xmath40 correction is clearly a function of the limiting magnitude of the observation .",
    "jtl showed that even though the contrast between stellar sbfs and gcs is a factor of ten higher in the ir than at optical wavelengths , the fraction of the total ir sbf power from gcs and galaxies can still be @xmath43 , or larger in galaxies like ngc  3311 that have unusually large populations of gcs .",
    "at , the sky background is hundreds of times brighter than in the optical bands .",
    "even when ir integrations are long enough to detect sbfs , the majority of the gcs remain undetected in the background noise .",
    "when the fit to the gc and galaxy luminosity functions is derived from only the few brightest objects , it is poorly constrained and the uncertainty in @xmath40 is the principal source of uncertainty in .",
    "jtl showed that using deep optical images to identify the locations of gcs and background galaxies undetected in the ir can reduce @xmath40 to negligible levels . from the optical image ,",
    "a mask was created and used to remove objects from the  image that are too faint to be detected at . with much lower background levels , the optical image reaches a much fainter limiting magnitude and the resulting mask removes a greater fraction of the gcs and galaxies .",
    "we used the composite optical / ir technique to remove the gc and galaxy contributions from the coma and hydra data .",
    "for the observations of relatively nearby galaxies studied by jtl , the residual variance @xmath40 from gcs and galaxies after applying a mask generated from deep @xmath44-band images was less than 1% and was ignored . for the coma cluster data presented here , the optical images only reach gcs two to three mag brighter than the peak of the luminosity function , requiring a careful correction for the the clusters and galaxies that remain unmasked . for the present study",
    ", we developed a straightforward method for estimating @xmath40 in the  observations based on the @xmath44-band photometry .",
    "we transformed the @xmath44-band magnitudes to -band assuming a uniform color for each of the gc and galaxy populations .",
    "values were computed for the @xmath45 colors of the gcs and galaxies by adopting mean @xmath46 colors from frogel et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and mean v - i colors from ajhar & tonry ( 1994 ) ( gcs ) and jtl ( galaxies ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath47 for gcs and 2.1 for galaxies .",
    "the coordinates of the objects were scaled and translated to the frame defined by the  image .",
    "we then fitted the luminosity functions , created a mask of objects brighter than the completeness limit , and estimated the @xmath14-band correction @xmath40 for our observations .",
    "to fit the gc luminosity function , we assumed the width , form , and peak magnitude of the gclf , which required a preliminary estimate of the distance .",
    "fitting the galaxy luminosity function required a power - law slope and normalization .",
    "jtl described the detailed forms of the luminosity functions used to estimate @xmath40 .",
    "the fluctuation magnitude is not sensitive to the fit parameters provided that objects @xmath48 mag from the gclf peak and brighter are measured , fitted and masked .",
    "the variance is dominated by the brightest objects , so  is insensitive to errors in the fit to the faint end of the luminosity functions .",
    "to compute the fluctuation magnitude and distance to each galaxy , we first measured the  sbf power in three annular regions centered on each galaxy .",
    "radii and @xmath38 powers measured are listed in table  [ mbars ] .",
    "the power spectra are plotted in figures  [ hydrapowerspectra ] and [ comapowerspectra ] with the individual components @xmath49 and @xmath39 , and their sum .",
    "we determined the fluctuation magnitudes  corrected for residual variances using equation  [ mkp ] .",
    "finally , the absolute fluctuation magnitude  from jtl was used to compute the distance moduli .",
    "jtl described the advantages of using optical images to identify and mask gcs and background galaxies in ir images prior to performing the sbf analysis .",
    "we applied this technique ( as described in section  [ howtosbf ] ) to the data presented in this paper .",
    "we used the @xmath44-band image of ngc  4889 kindly provided by j. blakeslee ( 1997 , private communication ) to identify gcs and galaxies down to approximately @xmath50 .",
    "a. dressler ( 1997 , private communication ) generously made a deep @xmath44-band image of the hydra galaxies available , allowing us to reach a similar limiting magnitude in our hydra data .",
    "to constrain the gclf at , we adopted uniform gc and galaxy colors and translated @xmath44 magnitudes to @xmath14 as described in the previous section .",
    "we then performed the fit to the gc and galaxy luminosity functions as if the data had been collected from a @xmath14-band image and created a mask of all objects brighter than the completeness limit .",
    "the luminosity functions were integrated beyond the cutoff magnitude as a function of radius from the center of each galaxy , and we computed the residual variance @xmath40 for each annular region .",
    "@xmath40 values are listed in table  [ mbars ] .",
    "the luminosity functions are plotted in figure  [ gclf ] .",
    "we adapted the models developed by blakeslee & tonry ( 1995 ) to check our estimate of the residual variance contributed by gcs and galaxies . if the gc specific frequency is @xmath51 for ngc  4889 ( blakeslee & tonry 1995 ) then @xmath52 , which corresponds to a correction of @xmath53 .",
    "we note , however , that the specific frequency measured by blakeslee & tonry is smaller in the inner regions of ngc  4889 by a factor of two to three .",
    "the variance is proportional to @xmath54 , so we expect to find @xmath55 within 48  of the center .",
    "examination of the @xmath56 values listed in table  [ mbars ] confirms that the correction for undetected gcs and galaxies is less than 20% for ngc  4889 .",
    "this assumes no additional @xmath41 correction for residual spatial variance in the background . if @xmath41 is subtracted from @xmath38 prior to making the comparison to @xmath40 , we find that @xmath40 is 0.2 to 0.4 times the fluctuation power , just as the models predict .",
    "ngc  3311 in hydra has a high specific frequency @xmath57 ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "1995 ) , but the hydra cluster is much closer than coma and the optical images are comparably deep , so the gclf for ngc  3311 is better sampled ( in fitting the gclf , we assumed that all gcs detected belong to the ngc  3311 system ) .",
    "the @xmath40 correction for the hydra galaxies is less than 2% for most annuli .",
    "subtracting @xmath41 from @xmath38 results in a gc and galaxy contribution to the fluctuation power between 3 and 6% .",
    "the model predicts a @xmath40 correction of @xmath58 for ngc  3311 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath54 is lower near the center of ngc  3311 where the galaxy is brightest .",
    "it is encouraging how well the point - source masks derived from optical data reduce the residual variance from undetected gcs and galaxies . even though several assumptions about the gclf must be made to compute @xmath40 , the fluctuation magnitude is not sensitive to the exact form of the luminosity function .",
    "for example , if the distance used to fix the peak of the gclf for ngc  4889 is changed from 70 to 110 mpc , the result is a change of only 0.03 mag in .",
    "similarly , changing the width of the gclf , or the relative fractions of galaxies and gcs , or the bright cutoff magnitude , or any of the other input parameters , had an even smaller effect on the final fluctuation magnitude .",
    "these details may be important for measuring a distance based on the absolute magnitude of the gclf peak , but they do not significantly affect the  fluctuation magnitude . there is sufficient covariance between the fit parameters that if the fit to either the gc or galaxy luminosity function is in error , the fitting procedure will compensate by adjusting the other , resulting in a fit that comes close to correctly predicting @xmath40 .",

    "the sky power subtraction experiment was not repeated for the hydra data because the galaxies almost completely fill the field of view .    assuming uniform colors for the gc and galaxy populations to determine the @xmath40 correction potentially introduces a bias in the fluctuation magnitudes we measure .",
    "some faint galaxies are extremely red , and if they are not masked ( because they are fainter than the completeness limit in @xmath44 ) , they will add more flux to the sbf power spectrum at   than we subtract with @xmath40 .",
    "approximately four objects were easily detected in the  image of ngc  4889 that were below the completeness limit in the @xmath44-band image .",

    "we can not say how much additional power must be subtracted from @xmath38 to account for very red objects in our field without knowing the color distributions of gcs and background galaxies . at an approximate level , though , we account for the deficit in @xmath40 with our uniform residual variance correction @xmath41 .",
    "if the extremely red objects ( mostly background galaxies ) are distributed uniformly in the field of view , then they will most strongly influence the outer annuli , causing a radial increase in @xmath38 . by adopting a level of residual variance @xmath41 that best removes the radial trend in @xmath38 ,",
    "we simultaneously correct for both residual patterns and uniformly distributed red galaxies .",

    "the center of this galaxy has an unusual off - center nucleus , and the galaxy fitting routine fails near the center .",
    "we masked the center of ngc  3311 prior to measuring the sbfs , but it is not clear if the anomalous fluctuation magnitude is the result of a distinct stellar population in the nuclear region of ngc  3311 or due to a failure in the sbf analysis .",
    "it is also possible that the nuclear region of ngc  3311 is obscured by dust .",
    "a uniform distribution of dust will reduce the measured fluctuation amplitude .",
    "the inner annulus is excluded from the power spectrum plotted in figure  [ hydrapowerspectra ] and from the calculation of  for this galaxy .",
    "sbfs in the central region of ngc  4889 are brighter than in the outer annuli after correction for residual variance .",
    "both @xmath44 and  images show a similar pattern near the center that may be blended images of gcs or stellar sbfs .",
    "they may also signal the failure of our galaxy model fitting routine , which sometimes has difficulty very near the centers of galaxies .",
    "since the fluctuation magnitude is 0.5 mag brighter in the inner annulus than in any of the other annuli ( including composite regions that include the inner annulus but weight it less heavily ) , it seems likely that the inner measurement is biased by point sources or a deviation of our model from the real surface brightness profile near the center .",

    "the individual uncertainties for the hydra and coma observations are specified in detail in table  [ errorbudget ] .",
    "some of these uncertainties are systematic to our study , so the uncertainties in our final fluctuation magnitudes are larger than the scatter between individual measurements .",

    "the estimated uncertainty in the correction for any residual spatial variance ( @xmath41 ) is the dominant source of uncertainty listed in table  [ errorbudget ] . whether or not this uncertainty affects all annuli equally ( systematically ) or not depends on the distribution of the background variance in the image .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath41 is particularly difficult to estimate because many sources of variance add to the power measured ( residual dark current from saturated sources , unmasked objects in sky images , etc . ) .",
    "we corrected for background spatial variance as well as possible and estimated realistic uncertainties , but adding systematic uncertainties in quadrature leads to an underestimate of the uncertainty in . to account for the fact that the uncertainty in @xmath41 has both random and systematic components , we estimated an additional systematic uncertainty from residual background variance subtraction and included it in table  [ errorbudget ] .",
    "the correction for residual variance from undetected gcs and galaxies also has random and systematic uncertainties associated with it , and we added an additional systematic uncertainty in @xmath40 to table  [ errorbudget ] .",

    "ir sbf distance measurements to three galaxies in the hydra and coma clusters imply a hubble constant @xmath4   if sources of residual variance have been subtracted correctly .",
    "results from both clusters are consistent .",
    "these measurements support the conclusion that hydra s radial peculiar velocity is small .",
    "fluctuations from globular clusters and background galaxies can be adequately removed , even at distances of 7000 .",
    "modest optical exposures can be used to identify and mask gcs and galaxies in ir images , potentially reducing the variance from undetected gcs and galaxies to negligible levels . without using optical images , considerably longer",
    "ir integrations could be required to reduce the gc correction to similarly low levels .",
    "\\3 . corrections to remove residual spatial variance in the background are necessary to measure radially consistent fluctuation magnitudes .",
    "the power spectrum of the noise in our near - ir images is not independent of wavenumber . for the relatively short integration on ngc  4889 described in this study ,",
    "the size of the correction for residual variance is large compared to the sbf signal . to achieve reliable results in the future ,",
    "ir sbf researchers should strive to produce images that are as clean and flat as possible , and to integrate long enough under good seeing conditions to achieve a high @xmath9 .",
    "additional improvements in observing techniques may also help reduce residual background variance in future ir sbf measurements .",
    "the sbf observations described in this study were obtained using relatively short integration times on a modest 2.24 m telescope and using the first of a new generation of 1024@xmath13-pixel ir detectors .",
    "future ir sbf studies of galaxies to 100 mpc and beyond will benefit from nicmos on the hubble space telescope with its low background , and from the new generation of 8  m class telescopes with clean , large - format ir detectors . for example , the gemini telescope on mauna kea with the niri infrared imager under good seeing conditions will make it possible to make high-@xmath9 @xmath14-band sbf measurements at the distance of the coma cluster in @xmath131  s per galaxy . with telescopes like gemini",
    "we will be able to reliably measure sbf distances to many galaxies in a distant cluster in a night , making it possible to measure the hubble constant , map peculiar velocities , and measure bulk motions on scales much larger than currently possible using sbfs .",
