    "density profiles for @xmath83 and @xmath82 gyr are not shown because the halos are destroyed within a few gyr.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we see similar trends in the velocity data , which we present in figs . [",
    "fig : sigma ] and [ fig : beta ] . in fig .",

    "[ fig : beta ] , we show the velocity anisotropy @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are the velocity dispersions in spherical coordinates .",
    "we set up the initial conditions such that @xmath89 ( such that @xmath90 ) and given the equilibrium initial conditions , the velocity dispersion is initially equivalent to the rms velocities . even at late times in the cases of small @xmath4 or large @xmath25 ,",
    "the rms velocities are only slightly different from the velocity dispersions .",
    "as expected , the velocity dispersion profiles @xmath91 decrease in normalization as more halo particles decay , since the negative heat capacity of a self - gravitating system ensures that an injection of kinetic energy due to decays results in an overall decrease in the equilibrium kinetic energy of the halo ( cf .",
    "the most extreme drops in the velocity dispersion occur for small @xmath4 or large @xmath25  for which the kinetic energy injected into the halos due to decays is large .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile quickly settles to a new equilibrium for @xmath92 gyr .",

    "radial orbits in the outskirts of galaxies are easiest to strip since their binding energy is lower at fixed radius than more circular orbits . for large @xmath25and @xmath4 ,",
    "though , the orbits clearly become radially biased in the outskirts of the halo .",
    "these halos have not settled into a true dynamical equilibrium , and there is a significant net outflow of particles .",
    "this net outflow drives the radial bias in the orbits , and is more significant in the outskirts because any particle which decays onto an unbound orbit in the interior of the halo must pass through the exterior regions .",
    "moreover , the particles originating in the outskirts are more vulnerable to ejection , so the daughter particles originating in the outskirts will also have a significant radial bias .",
    "the interior regions of the halo are less vulnerable to decay ( unless @xmath12 ) and the dynamical time is short relative to the decay time , both of which serve to preserve the initial orbital structure deep within the halos .",
    "however , since the dark - matter mass profile may be inferred observationally but the dark - matter velocities are not , we focus our analysis on the mass distribution in halos as a function of decay parameters and time .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : rrho ] is that the nfw halo profile , eq .",
    "[ eq : rho ] , is clearly not a good fit to many of the profiles . in the way in which we have chosen to display the density profile information , @xmath98 as a function of @xmath28 ,",
    "the profile should be flat for @xmath99 and be monotonically decreasing for larger @xmath28 .",

    "[ fig : rrho].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to find the goodness of fit of the nfw profile quantitatively , as well as the best - fit nfw parameters , we bin the particles radially with respect to the center of mass of the system , and use two different likelihood estimation routines : a simple @xmath103 model , which should work in the limit of a large number of particles in each bin ; and a poisson - based likelihood .",
    "we treat the uncertainty in the number of particles in each bin as @xmath104 , where @xmath21 is the observed number of particles in a bin . instead of using @xmath105 and @xmath106 as free parameters in the nfw fit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) , we use @xmath107  and @xmath51 .",
    "we use 100 bins between @xmath108 ( @xmath109 kpc , the minimum radius at which numerical relaxation ceases to matter ) and @xmath110 ( the approximate virial radius at @xmath77 ) .",
    "we bin the particles either linearly or logarithmically in @xmath28 , and obtain identical fits , as expected .",
    "the minimum @xmath103 parameters are slightly biased relative to those obtained with the poisson likelihood function , but not at a significant level .",
    "thus , we can use statistics associated with @xmath103 to describe the fits , and define @xmath103 per degree of freedom ( @xmath103/d.o.f . ) as our metric for the fit quality .",

    "the size of the grid points corresponds to the quality of the fit .",
    "if the @xmath103/d.o.f . exceeds 1.5 at any time during the simulation , the grid point is small ; if @xmath103/d.o.f.@xmath113 for the whole simulation ( sampled every 0.5 gyr ) , then the point is large .",
    "in some cases , the fit is somewhat marginal @xmath114 much of the time , in the dividing regions of @xmath115 parameter space between good and really bad nfw fits .",
    "the general features between the simulations with initial @xmath116 and @xmath117 are similar , though ; for @xmath118 gyr and @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , the nfw profile is generally not a good fit to the halo profile at some ( especially late ) times . for lower @xmath25  or high @xmath4",
    ", the nfw density profile provides a reasonable fit throughout the lifetime of a halo , even if the halo mass and concentration change .",
    "the concentrations drop rapidly as @xmath20 increases , and the final concentration is less sensitive , in general , into @xmath4 than to @xmath20 .",
    "the concentration always decreases as a result of decay , which is expected if kinetic energy is injected to the halo or in the case of adiabatic expansion .         at large @xmath4 ( specifically , @xmath121 and 100 gyr ) and @xmath122 , the changes to the halo structure with time are well - described by the adiabatic - expansion scheme explored in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 is much greater than the halo dynamical time ( @xmath123 gyr for particles in an @xmath52 halo ) and the kick speed is high enough that daughter particles are cleanly ejected from the halo , then changes to the gravitational potential are adiabatic and easy to model .",
    "if all particles are on circular orbits , the density profile remains constant , but with the scale radius rescaled as @xmath124 and the nfw scale density rescaled as @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the fraction of the initial dark - matter particles that have decayed .",
    "we find that nfw profiles are a good fit for @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) and @xmath129 gyr with the adiabatic - expansion parameters , but this does not work so well for @xmath130 gyr or for @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that @xmath133 and @xmath134 are required for the analytic adiabatic - expansion description to describe halo evolution .",
    "we reported the goodness of fit and concentration in terms of @xmath135 instead of @xmath20 because we would like to extrapolate the findings of our simulations to other halo masses .",

    "when the decays are parametrized in terms of @xmath139 and @xmath135 , the @xmath140 and the @xmath142 lines are largely similar between the two different initial concentrations .",
    "the largest discrepancy occurs near @xmath143 and @xmath144 gyr .",
    "this effect is real , and is due to the fact that more concentrated halos have more particles that are more tightly bound to the halos , which makes the particles harder to eject .",
    "however , for @xmath145 or for the @xmath146 line , the differences in mass retention between the two sets of simulations are small .",

    "since the dynamical time depends on @xmath51 , which is related to the distribution of particle energies within the halo , some of the dependence of halo mass loss on concentration is divided out by parameterizing mass loss in terms of @xmath149 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "a more direct comparison would be to examine mass loss and concentration changes as a function of @xmath135 and @xmath139 for a fixed number of dynamical times .",

    "the nfw fit becomes better and concentrations tend to be slightly higher if the minimum radius is raised to 10 kpc from 4 kpc , and in general , nfw fits become better as the maximum radius considered in the fit decreases",
    ". fits to the outer part of the halo show a trend that the halo concentration is initially higher than that estimated from the halo as a whole , then dips low , and then becomes relatively high again .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the finite time it takes for particles ejected from the inner halo to reach the outer halo , and the longer dynamical ( and hence , equilibration ) time in the outer halo .",
    "the nfw profile is almost always a reasonable fit to the data with @xmath245 .    are these trends consistent with observations ?",
    "the relatively low concentration measured in the innermost part of the halo relative to the halo as a whole is qualitatively consistent with the low concentrations inferred from low - surface - brightness and dwarf - galaxy rotation curves .",
    "however , in the absence of selection biases , one would expect the weak - lensing - derived concentrations to be slightly higher than strong - lensing - derived concentrations for the same halos , and also slightly higher than concentrations inferred from x - ray gas profiles , which is the opposite of what is observed .",
    "x - ray and strong - lensing halo samples are likely highly biased towards higher concentrations , and so a better understanding of selection effects is necessary in order to understand the differences in inferred concentration among the various lensing , x - ray , and dynamical probes of dark - matter density profiles .",
    "nonetheless , the prediction from decaying - dark - matter models is that it is possible that different probes of dark - matter halo profiles will indicate different concentrations for the same halo , even if the nfw profile is shown to be a good fit to data from probes sensitive to the innermost or outermost parts of the halo , such as weak lensing or rotation curves .",
    "in this work , we have used simulations of two - body dark - matter decay in isolated halos initially in equilibrium to characterize the response of halos as a function of the center - of - mass kick speed @xmath25 , the decay time @xmath4 , and time .",
    "we find that for the union of the parameter space @xmath246 and @xmath247 , dark - matter halos are essentially unchanged ; the mass loss is @xmath198 over a hubble time , and the shape of the density profile does not change , although the concentration declines somewhat for @xmath248 .",
    "for the union of @xmath134 and @xmath249 , there is severe mass loss and a radical change to the shape of the dark - matter density profile .",
    "for the rest of the decaying - dark - matter parameter space , there is moderate mass loss and significant deviations of the shape of the dark - matter density profile relative to the initial halo properties .",
    "we used our simulations in conjunction with the observed mass - concentration relation and the galaxy - cluster mass function to constrain the two - parameter decay parameter space .",
    "we find that the mass - concentration relation yields the stronger constraint on @xmath4 for a broad range of @xmath25  , constraining @xmath250 gyr for @xmath251 .",
    "constraints on the decay parameters should improve greatly in the next 5 - 10 years with blossoming wide - field sunyaev - zeldovich and optical surveys , and with cosmological simulations of decaying dark matter ."
