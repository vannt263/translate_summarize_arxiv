    "pre - swift observations of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows have led to great strides in their theoretical interpretation , while leaving some major unanswered questions .",
    "the radio , optical , and @xmath0-ray emission of grb afterglows exhibit a power - law decrease with time ( @xmath8 ) from hours to tens of days after the burst , with the temporal index @xmath9 consistent with the slope @xmath10 of the power - law continuum ( @xmath11 ) within the framework of relativistic spherical blast - waves ( mszros & rees 1997 ) or of spreading relativistic jets ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "the collimation of the grb ejecta yields a steepening of the power - law decay when the relativistic beaming has decreased sufficiently that the jet boundary becomes visible . such a steepening has been observed for the first time in the optical light - curve of the afterglow 990123 ( kulkarni 1999 ) .",
    "since then about 10 other afterglows have displayed an optical light - curve break at about 1 day after the burst .",
    "the achromaticity of a jet light - curve break has not been clearly proven by pre - swift observations because the @xmath0-ray light - curves were not monitored over a time long enough to capture the jet - break .",
    "furthermore , the radio light - curves were usually poorly sampled during the first day and strongly affected by interstellar scintillation . the observations of many @xmath0-ray afterglows by swift , together with ground - based optical observations , will enable us to test achromaticity of the afterglow light - curve break , as appears to be the case for the afterglow 050525a ( blustin 2005 ) .",
    "the quenching of the interstellar scintillation of the radio afterglow 970508 ( frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 ) has confirmed that the source size increases as expected for a relativistic blast - wave , providing another test for this model .",
    "the decrease of the scintillation has also been observed in the radio afterglows 991208 , 021004 , and 030329 .",
    "further testing has been prompted by the detection of the optical afterglows of grbs 990123 and 021211 at very early times ( akerlof 1999 , fox 2003 , li 2003 ) , starting at about 100 s after the burst .",
    "the steep decays ( @xmath12 and 1.6 , respectively ) exhibited by these afterglows in the first 20 minutes can be attributed to the grb ejecta energized by internal shocks ( mszros & rees 1997 , 1999 ) or by the reverse shockcaused by the interaction with the circumburst medium ( sari & piran 1999 ) .",
    "a significant discrepancy between afterglow observations and theoretical expectations exists for the radio afterglows of grbs 991208 , 991216 , 000301c , and 010222 , whose decay over 12 decades in time is substantially slower than that of the optical emission ( frail 2004 , panaitescu & kumar 2004 ) .",
    "a change in the blast - waves dynamics , such as the transition to semi - relativistic dynamics , is not a possible explanation , because the different radio and optical decays are observed over time ranges which overlap substantially . our analysis ( panaitescu & kumar 2004 ) of these afterglows shows that evolving microphysical parameters can not decouple the optical and radio decays .",
    "this decoupling may be achieved if there is an extra radio emission arising from some late ejecta , energized by a reverse shock . for the optical afterglow to remain unaffected",
    ", the incoming ejecta should not alter the dynamics of the blast - wave , they should carry less kinetic than that already existing in the swept - up circumburst medium .    the swift measurements of the @xmath0-ray afterglow emission , starting from 100 s after the burst , opens new possibilities for testing the blast - wave model and for refining its details .",
    "the xrt 0.210 kev light - curves of the 9 @xmath0-ray afterglows ( 050126 , 050128 , 050219a , 050315 , 050318 , 050319 , 050401 , 050408 , 050505 ) presented by campana ( 2005 ) , chincarini ( 2005 ) , and tagliaferri ( 2005 ) , have shown that some @xmath0-ray afterglows decay very fast ( @xmath13 ) within the first few minutes after the burst , as reported previously for the afterglows 990510 ( pian 2001 ) and 010222 ( int zand 2001 ) , followed by a slower decay phase ( @xmath14 ) , and a break to a steeper decay ( @xmath15 ) at a later time , ranging from 1 hour to 1 day .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate what features of the blast - wave model are required to accommodate the various decays of these swift @xmath0-ray afterglows .",
    "barthelmy ( 2005 ) have shown that the very early fast decay of the @xmath0-ray emission of the afterglows 050315 and 050319 can be understood as the grb emission from the fluid moving at angles larger than the inverse of the forward shock s lorentz factor . due to the curvature of the emitting surface",
    ", this large angle emission arrives at the observer at an ever increasing time and ever decreasing frequency ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "however , for two other swift afterglows with an early , fast decaying @xmath0-ray emission ( 050126 and 050219a ) , tagliaferri ( 2005 ) have found that the 15350 kev grb emission extrapolated to the xrt 0.210 kev band ( under the assumption that the burst power - law spectrum extends unbroken to lower energies ) falls short of the flux measured at the beginning of the @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "if the burst spectrum has a break below 15 kev , below which it is harder , then the grb extrapolated flux would be even less .",
    "this suggests that the fast falling - off @xmath0-ray emission does not arise from the same mechanism as the burst itself , and that it may arise in the forward shock .",
    "therefore , for at least these two last bursts , we shall test whether the very early @xmath0-ray emission can have the same origin as the rest of the afterglow .",
    "the steepening observed at later times is most naturally attributed to a collimated outflow ( jet ) , hence we shall test if the pre- and post - break @xmath0-ray light - curve indices and the spectral slopes are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "for the dynamics and collimation of the relativistic blast - wave , we consider three cases : @xmath16 a spherical grb remnant , in the sense that observations were done at a time when the afterglow lorentz factor @xmath17 was larger than the inverse of the jet opening @xmath18 and , hence , the effects associated with collimation were not yet detectable , @xmath19 a jet whose edge is visible ( @xmath20 ) and which does not expand laterally ( because it is embedded in an outer outflow , but whose emission is dimmer ) , and @xmath21 a jet with sharp edges , which spreads laterally and is observed when @xmath20 .",
    "these models will be named ",
    ", , and , respectively .    at a frequency above that of the synchrotron peak , @xmath22 ,",
    "the index @xmath9 of the light - curve power - law decay depends on + @xmath16 the index @xmath23 of the power - law electron distribution with energy @xmath24 @xmath19 the density stratification of the circumburst medium ( cbm ) , for which we assume a power - law profile @xmath25 which comprises a homogeneous cbm ( @xmath26 ) and a pre - ejected wind at constant speed and mass - loss rate ( @xmath27 ) , the condition @xmath28 being required for a decelerating blast - wave , + @xmath21 the location of the cooling frequency @xmath29 relative to the observing band . the @xmath29 is the synchrotron characteristic frequency corresponding to an electron energy for which the radiative ( synchrotron + inverse compton ) timescale is equal to the electron age . + the expressions for @xmath30 for the  model are given in mszros & rees ( 1997 ) and sari , narayan & piran ( 1998 ) for @xmath26 and in chevalier & li ( 2000 ) for @xmath27 .",
    "rhoads ( 1999 ) and sari , piran & halpern ( 1999 ) have shown that , for the model , @xmath31 , irrespective of the location of @xmath29 and cbm stratification .",
    "these and other results for the  and models are summarized below .      because we will determine from observations the required structure of the cbm , the parameter @xmath32 , we start from the most general expressions for the evolution with observer time @xmath33 of the afterglow spectral properties : peak flux @xmath34 , and frequencies @xmath22 and @xmath29 . as derived in panaitescu & kumar ( 2004 ) , they are : @xmath35 for both the  and models ( note that the evolution of @xmath22 is in independent of @xmath32 and that @xmath29 increases for @xmath36 , but decreases for @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 for the  model and @xmath39 for the model . for the latter , the faster decay is due to that the jet area is a factor @xmath40 smaller than that visible to the observer in the case of a spherical outflow .",
    "the synchrotron afterglow continuum is @xmath11 ( sari , narayan & piran 1998 ) , where @xmath41 we restrict our attention to the @xmath42 cases , for which @xmath43 , as observed by xrt for the swift @xmath0-ray afterglows . from equations ( [ nuic])([fpj ] ) , it is easy to obtain the synchrotron light - curve decay @xmath8 : @xmath44 [ sa ] @xmath45",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47    from the above equations , it can be seen that the passage of the cooling frequency through the observing band steepens the afterglow decay by @xmath48 , which is at most 1/4,in addition to softening the spectrum by @xmath49 for @xmath36 or hardening it by @xmath50 for @xmath37 .",
    "the representative values chosen for @xmath32 these equations show that the observable quantity @xmath51 has a stronger dependence on the cbm structure for @xmath52 ( winds ) than for @xmath53 .",
    "the case @xmath54 should be taken only as the @xmath55 limit ; for @xmath54 the outflow deceleration is not a power - law in the observer time , instead @xmath56 .    for the model ,",
    "the ( @xmath57 ) closure relation is : @xmath58 @xmath59    equations ( [ sc ] ) , ( [ jc ] ) , and ( [ jc ] ) are valid whatever is the location of the injection frequency .",
    "however , there are further constraints for the applicability of the @xmath60 case : @xmath61 for all models and @xmath62 for the  and models respectively .    the models  , , and with @xmath63",
    "will be designated as , , and ( the letter `` a '' indicating that the electrons radiating synchrotron emission at the observing frequency are losing energy adiabatically ) , while the models with @xmath64 will be called , , and ( where the letter `` c '' shows that the electrons radiating at @xmath65 are cooling radiatively ) . note from equations ( [ sc ] ) , ( [ ja ] ) , and ( [ jc ] ) that for the and models , the index @xmath9 is independent of the medium structure , hence the type of cbm can not be determined for these models .      in the derivation of equation ( [ nuic ] )",
    "we have ignored a multiplicative factor @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is the compton parameter ) in the expression of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore equation ( [ nuic ] ) is valid if @xmath68 ( the radiative cooling of the electrons emitting at @xmath29 is synchrotron - dominated ) or if @xmath67 constant ( which corresponds to the @xmath69 case , where the @xmath67 parameter depends only on the ratio of the electron and magnetic field energies ) . if @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the decrease of the compton parameter with time leads to a faster increase or a slower decrease of @xmath29 than given in equation ( [ nuic ] ) and to a slower decay of the afterglow emission at @xmath72 .",
    "this case is most likely relevant for the @xmath73 @xmath0-ray afterglow phase , between the flattening and steepening times @xmath74 and @xmath75 , when the @xmath0-ray light - curve may exhibit a slower decay than that resulting from equations ( [ sc ] ) , ( [ jc ] ) , and ( [ jc ] ) .",
    "the equations for the afterglow light - curve at @xmath72 for the ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) case , derived by panaitescu & kumar ( 2001 ) , lead to : +   + @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 for simplicity , the results in equations ( [ sc0])([jc2 ] ) are given for the two most likely types of cbm structure  @xmath26 and @xmath27  and not for any @xmath32 . for the model , @xmath9 is quasi - independent on the stratification of the cbm : @xmath80    the results given for @xmath81 in equations ( [ sc0])([jcy ] ) are valid also for @xmath82 as long as the total electron energy is a constant fraction of the post - shock energy , which is equivalent to saying that the high - energy cut - off of the electron distribution , which must exist for a finite total electron energy , has the same evolution as the minimum electron energy , @xmath83 .",
    "the above equations show that the passage of the cooling frequency through the observing domain slows the afterglow decay by @xmath84 for @xmath26 and @xmath85 .",
    "the temporal evolutions given in equations ( [ nuic ] ) and ( [ fpj ] ) were derived under the assumption of an adiabatic blast - wave .",
    "if the electron fractional energy is around 50 percent and if the electrons cool radiatively ( @xmath69 ) , then radiative losses become important . in this case",
    "the afterglow emission decays faster than for an adiabatic grb remnant , given the stronger deceleration , therefore radiative blast - waves should be of importance for the fast decaying , very early swift @xmath0-ray afterglows .    from @xmath16 the dynamics of a fully radiative blast - wave ( @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the mass of the swept - up cbm ) and using @xmath19 the scalings for the spectral characteristics ( @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the post - shock magnetic field strength , @xmath83 is the electron energy , and @xmath90 is the energy of the electrons whose radiative cooling timescale is equal to the dynamical timescale ; @xmath91 for the  model and @xmath92 for the model ) , and @xmath21 the relation between the observer time and blast - wave radius @xmath93 , the following evolutions of the spectral characteristics",
    "can be derived : @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 hereafter , radiative afterglows will be indicated with the letter `` r '' preceding the specific model . note from equation ( [ rnuic ] ) that , just as for an adiabatic afterglow , the cooling frequency increases for @xmath36 and decreases for @xmath37 .",
    "the light - curve decay indices resulting from equations ( [ beta ] ) and ( [ rnuic])([rfpj ] ) are : @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100    the condition @xmath69 required by radiative dynamics guarantees that the compton parameter @xmath67 is constant , hence there are no further complications with the inverse compton - dominated electron cooling , as it was the case for an adiabatic blast - wave . given that , in the model , the jet lorentz factor decreases exponentially with radius ( rhoads 1999 ) , the dynamics and light - curves of a radiative jet should be close to those for an adiabatic jet ( and [ [ jc ] ] ) .",
    "there are two other factors which can alter the afterglow decay index @xmath9 .",
    "one is that the relativistic outflow can be endowed with an angular structure , where the ejecta kinetic energy per solid angle , @xmath101 , is not constant ( mszros , rees & wijers 1998 ) .",
    "the light - curve decay indices for an axially - symmetric outflow with a power - law structure @xmath102 where the angle @xmath103 is measured from the symmetry axis ( which , for simplicity , is assumed to be also the direction toward the observer ) are given in mszros , rees & wijers ( 1998 ) and panaitescu & kumar ( 2003 ) . in this work ,",
    "recourse to a structured outflow will be made only to explain afterglow decays which are slower than that expected for the  model .",
    "evidently , such structured outflows require @xmath104 .",
    "if the slow @xmath0-ray decay is preceded by a faster fall - off , then the index @xmath105 changes to @xmath106 close to the outflow axis , corresponding to the or models .",
    "if the slow @xmath0-ray decay is followed by a steepening , then , going away from the outflow axis , the index @xmath105 changes to either @xmath107 ( if the steeper decay is accommodated by the  model ) or to @xmath106 ( if that steeper decay can be explained with the and models ) . therefore , in the most general case , where the @xmath0-ray light - curve exhibits a sharp decay followed by a slow fall - off and then a steeper dimming , the outflow should have a bright spot moving toward the observer , surrounded by a dim envelope ( so that a steep decay is obtained when the spot edge becomes visible to the observer ) , which is embedded in a more energetic outer outflow ( yielding the slower decay ) , whose collimation leads to the late steepening when the outflow boundary becomes visible .",
    "the decay index for the synchrotron emission from a structured outflow can be derived as described in panaitescu & kumar ( 2003 ) . for a power - law radial structure of the cbm and angular structure of the outflow ,",

    "evidently , the structured outflow model can be at work only if the above decay is slower than that observed , the condition @xmath116 leading to a constraint on the cbm structure : @xmath117    equations ( [ soa ] ) and ( [ soc ] ) give the outflow structural parameter which accommodates the observed light - curve index @xmath9 and spectral slope @xmath10 : @xmath118      another process which can reduce the afterglow dimming rate is the injection of energy in the blast - wave ( paczyski 1998 , rees & mszros 1998 ) by means of some ejecta which were ejected later than the grb ejecta ( a long - lived engine ) or at the same time but with a smaller lorentz factor , thus reaching the decelerating grb ejecta during the afterglow phase ( a short - lived engine ) .",
    "a delayed injection of energy into the afterglow can be due to the absorption of the dipole electromagnetic radiation emitted by a millisecond pulsar ( dai & lu 1998 , zhang & mszros 2001 ) if such a pulsar was formed .",
    "the addition of energy in the blast - wave mitigates its deceleration and , implicitly , the afterglow decay rate .",
    "rees & mszros ( 1998 ) have derived the decay index @xmath9 for an energy injection that is a power - law in the ejecta lorentz factor .",
    "the expressions for the index @xmath9 for an energy injection which is a power - law in the observer time , @xmath119 are given in ( 23 ) , ( 24 ) , and ( 30 ) of panaitescu & kumar ( 2004 ) . from those equations",
    ", it follows that energy injection reduces the light - curve decay indices given in equations ( [ sa])([jc ] ) by @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 for the adiabatic  , , and models .",
    "lastly , all the decay indices given in the above equations were derived assuming that the microphysical parameters which determine the spectral characteristics ( @xmath22 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 ) and the continuum slope ( @xmath10 ) , the parameters for the typical post - shock electron energy & magnetic field strengthand the power - law index @xmath23 of the electron distribution with energy , are constant .",

    "this afterglow is similar to 050315 , the hardening of the @xmath0-ray spectrum across the light - curve flattening , which occurs at @xmath152 , being stronger .",
    "barthelmy ( 2005 ) have shown that the bat grb emission extrapolated to the xrt band matches the @xmath0-ray flux measured at 200 s. if the origin of time for the @xmath0-ray emission is set at the beginning of the second ( and last ) grb pulse , then the decay index ( @xmath153 ) of the early @xmath0-ray emission is consistent with the expectations for the large - angle grb emission ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "however , the early @xmath0-ray spectrum ( @xmath155 ) is rather soft compared to that of the burst . on the other hand , the substantial hardening of the @xmath0-ray spectrum across @xmath74 , with @xmath156 , exceeds that which the passage of the cooling frequency through the observing band can produce ( @xmath157 ) , suggesting that the @xmath0-ray emissions during the @xmath123 and @xmath73 afterglow phases arise from different mechanisms .",
    "we note that the @xmath0-ray light - curve for both phases may be explained in the structured outflow framework if we make the ad - hoc assumption that the spectrum of the spot emission ( dominating the afterglow flux before @xmath74 ) is softer than that from the surrounding outflow ( which overtakes the spot emission after @xmath74 ) .",
    "the steepening of the @xmath0-ray light - curve at @xmath150 s can be explained by seeing the edge of a jet ( spreading or not ) , or with the model and a cbm structure changing from a @xmath7 wind to a homogeneous medium at @xmath75 .",
    "all these models require a hard electron distribution , with @xmath158 .",
    "* although the xrt observations started 100 s after the burst , a steeply falling - off phase was not seen . until @xmath159 s",
    ", it exhibits a decay so slow that it can not be explained without energy injection or a structured outflow .",
    "the model with energy injection requires too much energy , while the structured outflow does not satisfy condition @xmath136 for the model .",
    "then the steepening of the @xmath0-ray light - curve at @xmath75 can be understood either as resulting from the cessation of the energy injection or from seeing the outflow boundary . in the latter case ,",
    "the light - curve decay should be steeper than for the  model and slower than for the model . that the steeper decay after @xmath75 can be accommodated by either the  and models ( table 1 ) supports a structured outflow as the source of the @xmath0-ray light - curve steepening .",
    "* 050408 . *",
    "this afterglow is very similar to 050401 , except that the steepening occurs later , at @xmath160 s. its light - curve decay before @xmath75 is also too slow and requires an energy injection episode or a structured outflow .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectral slope after @xmath75 is not known , but if we assume that there is no spectral evolution across @xmath75 ( as is the case for all other afterglows ) , then the light - curve decay index and spectral slope measured after @xmath75 can be accommodated by the and models .",
    "the and models are also allowed , though it is unlikely that the radiative phase lasts until days after the burst .",
    "* 050505 . *",
    "this afterglow is similar to 050318 , its @xmath0-ray light - curve steepening at @xmath161 s without a spectral evolution .",
    "however , in contrast to 050318 , the spectral slopes and decay indices before and after @xmath75 can not be reconciled within any model other than , even if we allow for a varying cbm structure .",
    "besides that the radiative phase is unlikely to last until 1 day after the burst , the model requires a @xmath7 cbm profile , for which the closure equations given in section [ radiative ] are not accurate .",
    "hence , it seems more plausible that the slow decay of this afterglow before @xmath75 is due to energy injection or a structured outflow .",
    "the model fails to satisfy conditions @xmath136 and @xmath137 for these two case . as for the afterglows 050401 and 050408 , the steepening of the @xmath0-ray light - curve could then be attributed to the end of the energy injection or to the outflow axis becoming visible to the observer .",
    "as shown in table 1 , the three decay phases of the swift @xmath0-ray afterglows can be understood in the following way : @xmath16 the hardening of the 0.210 kev spectrum of the @xmath0-ray afterglows 050315 and 050319 from @xmath6 s ( when a fast decaying @xmath0-ray emission is observed ) to @xmath162 s ( when the @xmath0-ray light - curve exhibits a slow decay ) indicates that the early , fast - falling off @xmath0-ray emission arises from a different mechanism than the rest of the afterglow .",
    "barthelmy ( 2005 ) have argued that this mechanism is the same as for the grb emission .",
    "the results of tagliaferri ( 2005 ) suggest that this explanation does not work well for the afterglows 050126 and 05018 . in these cases ,",
    "the steep @xmath0-ray decay require a very narrow outflow whose edge is seen as early as 100 s after the burst , the following , slower decay phase being explained by energy injection in the blast - wave or by a rather contrived ( see below ) angular structure of the blast - wave , + @xmath19 the @xmath0-ray decay measured until 1h , 0.3d , and 0.5d for the afterglows 050401 , 050408 , and 050505 , respectively , is too slow to be explained by the simplest blast - wave model .",
    "such a slow decay can be produced by an outflow endowed with angular structure or by a continuous injection of energy in the forward shock , + @xmath21 the steepening of the @xmath0-ray decay observed at 1h2d for the afterglows 050128 , 050315 , 050318 , and 050319 , at a time comparable to that of the steepening of the optical decay of many pre - swift afterglows , can be explained by seeing the edge of a jet . for the remaining 5 afterglows ,",
    "whose pre - break @xmath0-ray decay requires energy injection , the steepening can be attributed to the cessation of injection .    in the large - angle grb emission model for the early",
    ", fast falling - off phase , the @xmath0-ray emission arises from the same mechanism as the grb itself , but arrives at observer later because it comes from the shocked gas moving slightly off the direction toward the observer . for this model to be at work",
    ", three conditions must be satisfied .",
    "first , the 15350 kev grb emission extrapolated to the 0.210 kev @xmath0-ray band , under the assumption that the power - law burst spectrum @xmath163 extends unbroken down to 0.2 kev , should match or exceed the @xmath0-ray flux at the first epoch of observations .",
    "second , the spectral slope of the early afterglow should be the same as that of the grb .",
    "third , the @xmath0-ray light - curve decay index should be equal to @xmath164 ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) . for completeness , we present here a short derivation of this result .",
    "if the gr emission stops suddenly at some radius @xmath165 and blast - wave lorentz factor @xmath17 , then the received flux is @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the outflow comoving frame surface - brightness at frequency @xmath168 , @xmath169 is the elementary area whose radiation is received over an observer time @xmath170 , @xmath103 is the angle ( measured from the direction toward the observer ) of the fluid element from which radiation is received at time @xmath171 ( hence @xmath172 ) , @xmath173 is the relativistic doppler factor , and the expressions for @xmath174 and @xmath175 have been derived for @xmath176 , for the large - angle emission .",
    "the last factor @xmath177 in the expression of @xmath178 accounts for the beaming of radiation from a relativistic source .",
    "after substitutions , one obtains that @xmath179 .",
    "barthelmy ( 2005 ) found that the above three conditions for the large - angle grb emission as the source of the very early , fast @xmath0-ray decay are met for the afterglows 050315 and 050319 .",
    "for two other afterglows , 050421 ( sakamoto 2005 , godet 2005 ) and 050713b ( parsons 2005 , page 2005 ) , we find that their fast @xmath0-ray decays can not be reconciled with their hard @xmath0-ray continua by any of the blast - wave models considered here , but they do satisfy the last two conditions above for the large - angle grb emission interpretation .",
    "tagliaferri ( 2005 ) showed that the early @xmath0-ray emissions of the afterglows 050126 and 050219a are brighter than the grb extrapolated fluxes and softer than the burst emission , therefore their early @xmath0-ray afterglows can not be immediately identified with the large - angle grb emission .",
    "kumar ( 2005 ) discuss the conditions under which the fast @xmath0-ray decay of these last two afterglows can be reconciled with the large - angle grb emission .",
    "the outflow structure required to explain a light - curve flattening followed by a steepening must contain a bright spot ( moving toward the observer ) surrounded by a dimmer envelope where the ejecta have a lower energy per solid angle @xmath101 , so that the emission from the spot exhibits a fast decay after its boundary becomes visible .",
    "further , the envelope should be embedded in a wider outflow whose emission overtakes that of the spot when the blast - wave lorentz factor has decreased sufficiently . to explain the light - curve flattening , the @xmath101 in this wider outflow should rise away from the spot as @xmath180 to @xmath181 , where @xmath103 is the angle measured from the outflow s symmetry axis . finally , to explain the light - curve steepening , the @xmath101 should stop increasing with angle ( for the  model ) or peak and then decrease ( for the and models ) .",
    "the decrease could be gradual , with the @xmath0-ray light - curve steepening occurring when the fluid at the peak of @xmath101 becomes visible and the outer outflow contributing to the post - break emission ( this is the light - curve break mechanism proposed by rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ) . if the decrease of @xmath101 is sharp , then the post - break @xmath0-ray light - curve decay will be faster , particularly if the outflow undergoes lateral spreading ( this is the light - curve break mechanism proposed by rhoads 1999 ) .    in the energy injection model , the forward shock energy increases due to some relativistic ejecta which catch up with the decelerating blast - wave ( rees & mszros 1998 ) .",
    "the energy injection reduces the blast - wave deceleration rate and mitigates the decay of the afterglow emission . in principle , during the slow @xmath0-ray decay phase , there could be an energy injection for all afterglows considered here ; table 2 lists only the cases when it is required . as shown in table 2 , we find that , to explain the slow phase of the @xmath0-ray afterglow decay , the blast - wave energy should increase with observer time faster than @xmath182 and slower than @xmath183 .",
    "the arrival of new ejecta at the forward shock could be due either to the spread in the lorentz factor of ejecta released simultaneously ( short - lived engine ) or to a long - lived grb engine , releasing a relativistic outflow for a source - frame duration comparable to the observer - frame duration of the slow @xmath0-ray decay phase . in the former case ,",
    "the ejecta  forward - shock contrast lorentz factor is @xmath184^{1/2 } \\siml 2 $ ] ( panaitescu & kumar 2004 ) , where @xmath185 is defined by equation ( [ ei ] ) , while in the latter case the lorentz factor ratio can be much larger .",
    "consequently , we expect that , for a short - lived engine , the reverse shock propagating in the incoming ejecta is only mildly relativistic and radiates mostly at radio frequencies while for a long - lived engine the reverse shock could be very relativistic and radiate in the infrared - optical .",
    "as mentioned above , the early , fast decay of the @xmath0-ray afterglows 050126 and 050219a can not be readily identified with the large - angle grb emission and could be attributed to the forward shock .",
    "the fast @xmath0-ray decay displayed by these afterglows at @xmath2 s can then be explained only within the structured outflow and energy injection models . in addition , two other afterglows , not considered in this work , 050712 ( grupe 2005 ) and 050713a ( morris 2005 ) , exhibit an @xmath0-ray decay which is too slow and incompatible with the reported @xmath0-ray spectral slope , both requiring either an energy injection or a structured outflow .    for the afterglows 050128 , 050318 , and 050319 , we find that a change in the circumburst density profile provides an alternate model to structured outflows and jets for the steepening of the @xmath0-ray decay observed by xrt after 0.1 d. for all three afterglows",
    ", the changing external density corresponds to a transition from a @xmath7 wind to a region of uniform or increasing density .",
    "the @xmath7 density structure requires a time - varying mass - loss rate and/or speed of the wind of the massive star grb progenitor , while the uniform or increasing density shell could result from the internal interactions in a variable wind ( ramirez - ruiz 2005 ) .",
    "the self - similar solutions of chevalier & imamura ( 1983 ) for wind - wind interactions indicate that a uniform shell results from a substantial decrease of the star s mass - loss rate accompanied by a large increase in the wind speed .",
    "these major changes in the wind properties would have to occur @xmath186 yrs before the grb explosion , if the radius where the @xmath7 circumburst density profile terminates is that of the forward shock at 0.11 d.    to answer the question of how can we distinguish between the above three models ( energy injection , structured outflow , non - monotonic circumburst density ) for flattenings and steepenings of the afterglow light - curve , we note that , if the cooling frequency located between the optical and @xmath0-ray domains , each of those models yields a specific difference @xmath187 between the changes @xmath188 and @xmath189 of the @xmath0-ray and optical light - curve decay indices .",
    "therefore , to discriminate among the few possible models discussed here , it is very important to monitor the optical afterglow emission over a wide range of times , from minutes to days after the burst .",
    "the most often encountered feature resulting from the analysis of the nine @xmath0-ray afterglows analyzed in this work is the existence of a substantial energy injection in the blast - wave at hours to 1 d after the burst .",
    "this energy injection is necessary to reconcile the slowness of the @xmath0-ray decay with the hardness of the @xmath0-ray continuum for five out of nine afterglows and is possible for the other four as well .",
    "the injection should increase the blast - wave energy as @xmath5 , @xmath33 being the observer time , leading to a shock energy which is eventually larger by a factor 101,000 than that at the beginning of the slow @xmath0-ray decay phase .",
    "the exponent @xmath185 of power - law energy injection identified in table [ t2 ] is generally inconsistent with that expected for the absorption of the dipole radiation from a millisecond pulsar ( see also zhang 2005 ) . in this case , an important energy input in the blast - wave is obtained only for the first few thousand seconds , when the pulsar electromagnetic luminosity is constant ( zhang & mszros 2001 ) , which leads to @xmath190 .",
    "hence the energy injection must be mediated by the arrival of new ejecta at the forward - shock .",
    "if the grb engine were so long - lived that only a small fraction of the total outflow energy yielded the burst emission , then such a large energy injection would imply an even higher grb efficiency than previously inferred ( above 30 percent ",
    "lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ) from afterglow energetics and would pose a serious issue for the grb mechanism ( nousek 2005 ) .",
    "however , we can not yet tell if the energy injection lasts for hours because the central engine is long - lived or because there is a sufficiently wide distribution of the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta expelled by a short - lived engine . in the latter case , the entire outflow could be emitting both the grb and afterglow emission and the grb efficiency remains unchanged .",
    "if the fast decaying @xmath0-ray emission preceding the slow @xmath0-ray fall - off arises from the forward shock as well , then energy injection must start at the end of the steep decay phase , it must be a well defined episode .",
    "however , in this scenario the outflow must be very tightly collimated to yield a fast decay at only 100 seconds after the burst .",
    "the blast - wave lorentz factor is @xmath191 ( @xmath192 being the shock energy in @xmath193 ergs and @xmath194 the circumburst medium particle density in @xmath195 ) , thus the jet opening must be less than @xmath196 . alternatively , the early fast falling - off @xmath0-ray emission could be the large - angle emission from the burst phase , overshining the forward shock emission .",
    "this interpretation is favoured by barthelmy ( 2005 ) and hill ( 2005 ) for the afterglows 050117 , 050315 , 0509319 , although for other afterglows ( 050126 and 050219a  tagliaferri 2005 ) the spectral properties of the burst and @xmath0-ray afterglow emissions are not readily consistent with each other .    for a structured outflow to explain all the three decay phases of the swift @xmath0-ray afterglows",
    ", the distribution of the ejecta kinetic energy with angle must be non - monotonic .",
    "this is somewhat contrived and inconsistent with the results obtained by macfadyen , woosley & heger ( 2001 ) from simulations of jet propagation in the collapsar model .",
    "thus structured outflows do not appear to provide a natural explanation for the features of the @xmath0-ray afterglow light - curves .",
    "we note that the inferred indices of the power - law electron distribution with energy , which are given in table 2 , range from 1.3 to 2.8 .",
    "one would have to ignore 4 of these 9 swift afterglows to obtain a unique electron index , @xmath197 .",
    "this is a puzzling feature of relativistic shocks in grb afterglows : the shock - accelerated electrons do not have a universal distribution with energy , a fact which is also proven by the wide spread of the high - energy spectral slopes of batse bursts ( @xmath198 in fig . 9 of preece 2000 ) , which is equal to @xmath199 or @xmath200 , and the by wide range of the optical post - break decay indices of the bepposax afterglows ( @xmath201 in fig . 3 of stanek 2001 and in fig.2 of zeh , klose & kann 2005 ) , which is equal to @xmath23 .",
    "however , from the @xmath0-ray spectral slope of 15 bepposax afterglows , de pasquale ( 2005 ) conclude that the electron index @xmath23 has an universal value of @xmath202 ( see their fig .",
