    "the heavy quark effective theory can be derived from the minkowski path integral in two stages @xcite .",
    "firstly a change of variables @xmath3 is made on the path integral to include an explict four - momentum @xmath4 in the quark fields , to boost to the rest - frame @xmath5 of the hadron : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where we can immediately perform the derivative that pulls down the boosting phase : @xmath9\\psi^\\prime(z ) \\label{eqcontaction}\\ ] ] to tree level we can immediately identify an anti - particle projected mass term as @xmath10 where the projector @xmath11 . beyond tree level the boost to the frame @xmath5 will contain counterterms that keep the renormalised boost in the desired location and we write the bare mass term as @xmath12 .    we may choose to formulate a discretised theory from either representation of the path integral [ labeq1 ] or [ labeq2 ] .",
    "however , we will argue that the latter is the preferable starting point for a lattice action for hadrons containing heavy quarks .    in hqet and ( moving ) nrqcd @xcite a foldy - wouthuysen transformation",
    "is performed on the four - spinors , and the lower component integrated out . in nrqcd",
    "a truncated expansion in @xmath13 is performed on the resulting effective action , and loop corrections to this expansion become divergent as the quark mass becomes less than the inverse lattice spacing . as noted in @xcite , by retaining lower components , we maintain the attractive property of possessing a continuum limit .",
    "the action ( [ eqcontaction ] ) can be euclideanised and then discretised using any of the currently used four - component lattice dirac operators , which we label generically as @xmath14 .",
    "this generates a euclidean lattice action for the boosted field , where we take the euclidean momentum @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 \\psi(z)\\ ] ] this action has a modified mass term containing a particle ( anti - particle if @xmath17 ) projector , and is exactly analogous to hqet where the particle fields are slowly varying , and the anti - particle fields acquire a doubled mass term .",
    "it is simple to write down the feynman rules for our action in terms of the feynman rules for the massless action @xmath18 .",
    "we denote the feynman rules associated with the lattice derivative @xmath14 as propagator @xmath19 , and quark n - gluon vertices @xmath20 .",
    "the quark - gluon vertices are unaltered for the boosted action , the modified propagator is given by : @xmath21 for the wilson action , @xmath22 and r(p ) encodes the wilson term .",
    "generically , the correct continuum limit requires @xmath23 while for an @xmath24 off - shell improved derivative we require of the chiral symmetry breaking term @xmath25 , the clover action has @xmath26 and applies the equation of motion to `` redefine '' the mass at order @xmath27 .",
    "this trick is not appropriate here due to the dirac structure and size of our mass term .",
    "the low momentum expansion of the denominator of the @xmath28 propagator for the tree level boost @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is : @xmath31 this low momentum expansion immediately implies the solutions for the pole ( @xmath32 ) and kinetic ( @xmath33 ) masses in table  [ tabdispersion ] .",
    ".[tabdispersion ] masses in the low order dispersion relation [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     indeed this mechanism is responsible for the dominance of the temporal gluon vertex that renders the perturbative equivalence of the heavy wilson action with the static wilson line .",
    "in contrast , the on - shell point of the boosted approach is by construction at the zero of external lattice momentum , and the quark gluon couplings are minimally distorted .",
    "we have calculated preliminary results for the one - loop self energy with both boosted and regular wilson fermions .",
    "the result for regular wilson fermions agrees with those of @xcite . in the wilson case the one - loop self energy @xmath35}$ ] ( as opposed to mass correction @xmath36}$ ] ) grows exponentially with the pole mass via the couplings in table  [ tabvertices ] . for boosted wilson fermions , however , the zero external four - momentum leaves the tadpole graph independent of the mass , and the the rainbow graph is only weakly dependent on the quark mass .",
    "a table of these results will be presented in a subsequent publication  @xcite ;",
    "for our toy @xmath37 case , the correct massless limit occurs at @xmath38 .",
    "the required boost @xmath39 should vanish when and @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we therefore input the known non - perturbative @xmath42 and take @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , @xmath30 .",
    "this subtraction of @xmath42 is a technicality that is unique to the wilson dirac operator .",
    "if the behaviour of @xmath45 is benign we will not have a significant `` tuning '' problem to locate the required non - perturbative boost , and then a massless mode will arise for small values of @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , it proved necessary to not make the regulating parameter @xmath46 too small in order to control the expense of solving the propagator .",
    "the solver for the projected mass term is simple to implement , and preconditions easily .",
    "some inversions have been performed on a @xmath47 quenched lattice at @xmath48 , and a heavy - light pseudoscalar correlation function obtained in figure  [ figcorr ] .",
    "while the data are not relevant for physical conclusions , the features of the correlation function successfully demonstrate the method .",
    "the light forward propagating particle mode is clearly present , with @xmath49 , while the heavy backwards propagating anti - particle mode is also clearly seen , with @xmath50 .    when the technique is coupled with an @xmath24 off - shell improved dirac operator such as @xmath51 it will lead to much improved lattice treatment of the semi - relativistic regime , such as charmonium and d mesons .",
    "the ability to insert spatial momenta in the action is highly promising for calculations with difficult kinematics , such semi - leptonic decays .",
    "during the lattice conference i became aware that a similar four - momentum boosted approach has been independently pursued by paul mackenzie @xcite , and i thank him for a copy of his unpublished notes .",
    "the mackenzie approach differs significantly in the technique for improvement and avoiding fermion doubling .",
