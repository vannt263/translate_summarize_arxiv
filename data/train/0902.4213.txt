    "we continue theoretical studies ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ; also see @xcite ) of persistent thermal activity of magnetar candidates  compact x - ray sources which include soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "the magnetars are thought to be warm , isolated , slowly rotating neutron stars of age @xmath1  yr with superstrong magnetic fields @xmath2  g ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "following many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we assume that the high level of magnetar x - ray emission is supported by the release of the magnetic energy in their interiors .",
    "although this assumption is widespread , there are alternative models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in paper  i we studied the thermal evolution of magnetars as cooling isolated neutron stars with a phenomenological heat source in a spherical internal layer .",
    "we analyzed the location and power of the source and compared our calculations with observations of sgrs and axps .",
    "we showed that the heat source should be located at densities @xmath3  , and the heating rate should be @xmath4  to be consistent with the observational data and with the energy budget of isolated neutron stars .",
    "a deeper location of the heat source would be extremely inefficient to power the surface photon emission , because the heat would be carried away by neutrinos .    here , we refine the model of the magnetar heat - blanketing envelope . in this envelope ,",
    "the effects of superstrong magnetic fields are especially important .",
    "we analyze the blanketing envelope consisting not only of iron ( fe ) but also of light elements ( h or he ) which can be provided by accretion at the early stage of magnetar evolution .",
    "chemical composition and strong magnetic fields do affect thermal conduction in the blanketing envelope and the thermal structure of magnetars .",
    "in addition to the results of paper  i ( and those of @xcite and @xcite ) , we take into account neutrino energy losses in the outer crust of the neutron star , which can also be important @xcite .",
    "for the observational basis , we take seven sources : three sgrs and four axps listed in table  [ tab : observ ] .",
    "we present their ages @xmath5 , effective surface temperatures @xmath6 ( redshifted for a distant observer ) , and redshifted thermal luminosities @xmath7 .",
    "the estimates of spin - down ages @xmath5 , blackbody effective surface temperatures @xmath8 , and non - absorbed thermal fluxes are taken from the sgr / axp online catalog maintained by the mcgill pulsar group.pulsar/magnetar/main.html ] all references in table  [ tab : observ ] , except for @xcite and @xcite , are taken from that catalog .",
    "we do not include sgr 162741 , the faint x - ray pulsar cxo j164710.2455216 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the unconfirmed axp candidate ax j1845.00258 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , because their ages @xmath5 are unknown ( as well as the thermal luminosity @xmath9 of sgr 162741 ) .",
    "we also do not include two axps , xte j1810197 and 1e 1048.15937 .",
    "their high pulsed fractions ( @xmath10 , e.g. , @xcite ) indicate that their flux comes from a small fraction of the surface , incompatible with the model considered here .",
    "in addition , we have excluded the axp 4u 0142 + 61 whose observed thermal emission can be attributed to a circumstellar dusty disk , rather than to a neutron star surface @xcite .       in tables",
    "[ tab : tbts12][tab : tbts_deep ] we present the relations between the temperature @xmath11 at the inner boundary of the blanketing envelope ( @xmath12 ) and the non - redshifted effective surface temperature @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , we list the values of the outward radial heat flux @xmath14 at @xmath12 .",
    "we assume no heat sources in the envelope and consider the fe envelope in the 1.4  @xmath15 neutron star of radius @xmath16  km with the dipole magnetic field ( @xmath17 or @xmath18  g at the magnetic pole ) .",
    "we present local values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 at magnetic poles , as well as surface - averaged values ( av ) .",
    "[ fig : append ] compares these @xmath11@xmath13 relations .",
    "we see that @xmath13 saturates at @xmath22  k if @xmath23 is placed at the bottom of the outer crust , @xmath24 , but it does not saturate at lower @xmath19 . in the former case",
    "the saturation occurs because of the strong neutrino emission at @xmath25  and high temperatures .",
    "we also plot the total outward heat flux through the boundary of the blanketing envelope , @xmath26 , in such a scale that corresponding curves match the @xmath11@xmath13 curves at low @xmath11 .",
    "then , the deviation of the @xmath13-curves from the @xmath26-curves directly measures the total energy loss due to neutrino emission in the blanketing envelope ( at @xmath27 ) ."
