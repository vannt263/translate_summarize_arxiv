    "in the context of the canonical quantization of diffeomorphism invariant theories of connections for a compact gauge group , in particular , quantum gravity in four spacetime dimensions , the quantum configuration space is coordinatized by certain elementary operators which could be called generalized wilson functions .",
    "these functions are labelled in general by a set of paths in the manifold in question .",
    "it turns out that the precise nature of these paths has a deep impact on the structure on the resulting quantum theory .",
    "all the considerations in quantum gravity to date concern the case that the paths defining a given wilson function can intersect only finitely many times . to insure this , piecewise analyticity was often assumed .",
    "therefore in the sequel we loosely denote that case by  the analytic category \" . in  the smooth category \" , however , the known results are sparse .    in this letter",
    "we extend the pioneering work by baez and sawin on this issue . specifically , this letter is organized as follows : + in section 2 we state the problem with the extension of results from the analytic to the smooth category and recall the results due to baez and sawin .",
    "then we prove a master theorem which extends the results due to these authors and which is key to sections 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "in section 3 we apply the master theorem to show how the results concerning the ashtekar - isham algebra can be immediately extended .    in section 4 and 5",
    "we define the notion of a spin web in analogy to the spin - nets of the analytic category in order to apply the master theorem to the extension of results by ashtekar , marolf , mouro and the authors concerning diffeomorphism invariant states of connections and associated diffeomorphism invariant operators .",
    "finally , in section 6 we apply the machinery of the previous sections to the operators that have proved to be elementary building blocks for the quantization of gravitational field .",
    "this section is divided into three parts . in the fist part we recall the basic notions of cylindrical functions on the space of distributional connections and inductive limit structures and",
    "review the results that one obtains if one labels cylindrical functions by piecewise analytic , finitely generated graphs . in the second part we review",
    "the construction , due to baez and sawin , of a new label set , called  webs \" , which are appropriate for the case that the loops defining the wilson functions are only piecewise smooth and may intersect each other an infinite number of times .",
    "finally , in the third part we prove the master theorem on which the rest of this letter is based .      in the loop quantization of gravity as initiated by ashtekar @xcite and jacobson , rovelli and smolin @xcite and gambini et .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) through embedding general relativity into a yang - mills theory phase space and making use of wilson loop variables as well as in a general framework for quantization of a diffeomorphism invariant theory of connections with local degrees of freedom @xcite one uses the algebra of cylindrical functions defined by the parallel transport maps as the main device [ 4 - 30 ] .",
    "the algebra , let us call it @xmath4 , is a sub - algebra of the algebra of functions defined on a space of @xmath5 connections @xmath6 .",
    "the connections are defined on a bundle over a manifold @xmath7 . for the simplicity",

    "the virtue of piecewise analytical graphs is that their edges can not intersect or overlap in an infinite number of distinct , isolated points or segments .",

    "the operators @xmath354 were already defined in @xcite where it is understood that we replace graphs by webs .    in the general case , for infinitely many intersections , ^i_s  =  .",

    "we observe below , that in fact the action of the dual @xmath362 of the hamiltonian constraint can be naturally defined on them and that it is free of the infinities emerging in the case of the above 3-geometry operators .",
    "one can easily repeat the regularization of @xcite of the hamiltonian constraint , with appropriate modifications , to the case of a web with an infinite number of intersection points among its defining curves .",
    "recall , that in the hilbert space @xmath133 of the cylindrical functions , one first defines a regulator depending hamiltonian operator @xmath363 where @xmath364 denotes the regulator .",
    "its domain is not dense in the smooth category any longer , in contrast to what happens in the analytical category .",
