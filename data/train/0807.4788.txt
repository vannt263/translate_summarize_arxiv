    "quantum communications , such as quantum teleportation  @xcite and secure quantum cryptography  @xcite , between two parties ( alice and bob ) , require that qubits in highly entangled states , such as bell states , be shared between the parties .",
    "the entanglement purification protocols proposed by bennett _ et al . _  @xcite and deutsch _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite are therefore not only important contributions to the theory of quantum information , but also essential ingredients to applications such as quantum communications .",
    "starting from partially entangled states , these protocols distill near - maximally entangled states shared by distant parties .",
    "more specifically , in such a purification protocol , multiple pairs of qubits in impure entangled states are initially supplied , from which purified pairs are then obtained after sacrificing some of the impure pairs .    in each step of an entanglement purification protocol",
    ", local quantum computers have to carry out several single - qubit rotations and two - qubit operations on the local qubits at the sites of alice and bob , respectively .",
    "in particular , controlled - not ( cnot ) gates play a major role in these purification protocols ( as well as in other fields of quantum information and computation ) . in purification protocols",
    "@xcite , alice and bob repeat a process in which , after choosing two shared entangled pairs in mixed states , they bilaterally apply cnot gates to their two local qubits that belong to the shared pairs , and measure one of the pairs . if the measured qubits are in either the @xmath0 or @xmath1 state , then the unmeasured pair is forwarded to the next step ; otherwise the unmeasured pair is discarded . in the more efficient deutsch protocol",
    "@xcite , tens of such repetitions are needed , which means that a corresponding number of cnot gates needs to be employed , and they should work with very low error rate . for most solid - state qubits ,",
    "two - qubit interactions are quite delicate and are difficult to control without error and decoherence . as such , creating quantum algorithms that employ _ fewer _ two - qubit operations is important to the successful construction of solid state quantum information processors .",
    "this optimization of the algorithmic aspects demands a closer inspection of the omnipresent cnot gate , a standard two - qubit gate .",
    "the cnot gate is most conveniently generated from ising - interactions .",
    "however , general solid - state interqubit interactions are not of the ising - type .",
    "instead , they are often in the form of the heisenberg exchange ( e.g. , as in electrically tuned quantum dots ) or xy model ( e.g. , cavity - coupled semiconducting quantum dots ( qd )  @xcite or superconducting josephson qubits  @xcite ) . in general ,",
    "when a cnot gate is constructed using the heisenberg exchange or the xy interaction , _ at least twice _ the number of two - qubit interactions have to be invoked with complicated pulse sequences .",
    "a key question is thus whether it is possible to devise quantum algorithms that take better advantage of these two particular qubit interactions , instead of relying exclusively on the standard but cumbersome cnot gate .",
    "a further incentive to study xy - model - based quantum algorithms lies in the recent advances in cavity - coupling of josephson superconducting qubits ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) of josephson qubits , because it is relatively easy to reach the strongly interacting regime for these systems .",
    "since cavity qed plays an important role for information exchange between static and flying qubits in quantum communication networks , and the effective interaction between cavity - coupled qubits is described by the xy - model , the development of xy - model - based quantum algorithms would pave the way for an easier integration of solid state qubits into a quantum communication network .    in this paper we study _ how to build entanglement purification protocols based on a two - qubit gate that can be easily generated by the xy interaction_. it is important to note that it is relatively easy to generate the iswap gate in the xy model .",
    "indeed , the cnot gate is built using _ two _ iswap gates _ and _ several single - qubit gates @xcite . here",
    "we show that the bilateral cnot gate ( bcnot ) used in entanglement purification protocols can be replaced by a bilateral iswap gate ( biswap ) . for solid - state qubits with xy inter - qubit interactions ,",
    "this change of gates leads to _ a significant simplification of each step of the entanglement purification protocol , and to a much higher robustness of the protocol .",
    "_ furthermore , purification protocols are often followed by hashing or breeding protocols . here",
    "we show that the bilateral cnot gates in the hashing or breeding protocol can also be replaced by bilateral iswap gates .",
    "in addition , we also discuss a purification protocol using @xmath2 gates , which are the basic typical operations for qubits that are coupled via heisenberg exchange interactions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate the iswap gate from the xy - model hamiltonian and the @xmath2 gate in the heisenberg model . in section iii , we show a purification protocol based on the iswap gate and discuss the effect of gate errors . in section  [ sec - hashing ] , we discuss the replacement of cnot gates by iswap gates in the hashing and breeding protocols . in section  [ sec - bell ] , we show an effective method of generating the four bell states based on the iswap gate . in section",
    "[ sec - example ] , we give four examples of the application of the present method .",
    "section  [ sec - discussion ] and [ sec - summary ] present discussions and a summary . in the appendix , we summarize the derivation of the xy interaction from a general qubit - cavity hamiltonian .",
    "let us note that we do not assume any particular method for distributing entangled qubits . in the following discussions , noisy entanglement is taken as a resource .",

    ", width=226 ]",
    "in this section we formulate the iswap gate from the xy model , and estimate the time required to obtain a conventional cnot gate using an iswap gate .",
    "we also consider the case of the @xmath2 gate from the heisenberg model .",
    "the hamiltonian of a coupled qubit - cavity system is typically given by the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , representing a linear interaction between a two - level system and a bosonic degree of freedom for the cavity , such as photons .",
    "when two qubits are coupled to the same cavity mode , the effective two - qubit interaction is described by the xy model .",
    "a derivation of the xy interaction from the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian is given in the appendix .",
    "the xy model is expressed by the hamiltonian @xmath9 with @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 are the pauli matrices acting on the @xmath13-th qubit with basis @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "two - qubit operations produced by @xmath16 acting on qubits ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' can thus be expressed as @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "note that the iswap gate is obtained when @xmath19 such that @xmath20 with  @xcite @xmath21 thus , in order to produce a single cnot operation , we have to precisely control two two - qubit operations and four single - qubit rotations .",
    "if we denote a single - qubit frequency as @xmath22 , the time for a single - qubit rotation is typically @xmath23 .",
    "the time to implement a cnot gate is thus : @xmath24 in this paper , we also study qubits whose interaction hamiltonian is an isotropic heisenberg form , written as @xmath25 with @xmath26 in this case , the typical two - qubit gate operation is @xmath2 , which is defined by  @xcite @xmath27 the cnot gate is expressed by @xmath28 where the controlled phase flip ( cpf ) gate is obtained by @xmath29 thus , the time to implement a cnot gate becomes @xmath30",
    "in this section we show that the two purification protocols proposed by bennett _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and deutsch _ et al_.  @xcite can be recasted using the iswap gate _ instead of _ the cnot gate .",
    "the initially supplied entangled pairs of qubits are assumed to be in a mixed state @xmath31 .",
    "the purification protocol proceeds recursively by choosing two entangled pairs , applying a bilateral cnot gate and measuring one of the pairs ( called target qubits ) .",
    "the application of the bilateral cnot to two pairs , @xmath32 ( source pair ) and @xmath33 ( target pair ) , is described by @xmath34 where @xmath35 indicates that alice and bob bilaterally operate the cnot gate on their local qubits that belong to @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "here we use the four bell basis states @xmath36 then , as an example , the bilateral cnot works like this @xmath37 between a source pair @xmath38 and a target pair @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote qubits that belong to alice , and @xmath42 and @xmath42 indicate those that belong to bob ( @xmath43 ) .        below",
    "we show that the conventional bilateral cnot gate ( bcnot ) can be replaced by the bilateral iswap gate ( biswap ) together with a few single - qubit rotations ( see fig .",
    "[ alice ] ) .",
    "first we introduce the gates involved .",
    "the biswap gate is defined as an application of the iswap gate at both locations to a pair of entangled qubits depicted in fig .  1 ( we call one pair ` source ' and the other ` target ' , as in refs",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the iswap gate can be expressed as @xmath44 here is an example of the biswap gate : @xmath45 similar to the biswap gate , we also define bilateral single - qubit @xmath46 rotations for alice and bob about the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 axes as those in ref .",
    "@xcite , denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . for example  ( the complete logic table is given in table  [ tab : rot ] ) , @xmath47    .bilateral rotations .",
    "note that , besides the coefficient , @xmath48 , the singlet state @xmath49 is unchanged . while , for the @xmath6 mapping , @xmath50 are exchanged . for the @xmath7 mapping , the states",
    "@xmath51 are exchanged . finally for @xmath8 mapping , the states @xmath52 are exchanged . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : adv ]",
    "in this section we quantitatively examine several examples using the xy interaction and compare our method with the conventional ones in the literature , which are based on the cnot gate .",
    "\\(1 ) imamoglu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a quantum computing architecture where localized electron spins in qds are qubits , and they interact with each other via the coupling to the vacuum field of a common microcavity . in this case , the qubit - qubit interaction mediated by the cavity photon is expressed by the xy model with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is two - photon detuning and @xmath55 is an effective two - photon coupling coefficient for the spin qubits .",
    "based on the parameters in the proposal , it takes about 30  psec per each iswap gate and 10  psec per each single - qubit rotation , so that it takes @xmath56100  psec for the cpf gate operation .",
    "if we assume that two rotations should be added to the cpf gate in order to obtain the cnot gate , it takes about 120  psec for the cnot operation .",
    "now if we replace the cnot gate by the iswap gate , we need 60 psec in total from eq .",
    "( [ puri_biswap ] ) .",
    "thus the operation time of our method is about half of the conventional method .",
    "\\(2 ) when two superconducting charge qubits interact with each other via capacitive coupling to a common superconducting coplanar resonator , the resulting effective inter - qubit interaction is also described by the xy model  @xcite .",
    "using @xmath57 , @xmath58  mhz , @xmath59  ghz , we have @xmath60  mhz and @xmath61  nsec . with @xmath62  ghz",
    ", we have @xmath63  psec .",
    "thus , we have @xmath64  nsec and @xmath65  nsec for a dephasing time of about 500  nsec .",
    "this means that _ our purification method is about twice as fast as the conventional one for entanglement purification_. we can also apply our method to purify flux qubits connected by a common lc circuit data bus  @xcite .    in the cases where",
    "multiple qubits are connected by a common cavity field or data bus , when we want to purify qubits by the method mentioned above , we can only choose one two - qubit pair at a time , since we can not control more than three qubits simultaneously .",
    "-measured.,width=264 ]    \\(3 ) our method can be applied to purify solid - state qubits with xy interactions , with or without cavity photons .",
    "figure  [ flux ] shows four three - junction superconducting flux - qubits , coupled to their neighbors via single josephson junction couplers .",
    "this setup is obtained by extending the setup shown in refs .",
    "we take @xmath66 and @xmath67 such that only the ground state of the four couplers ( classical region ) is involved in the coupling process , and each of the three - josephson - junction loops constitutes a flux qubit . here",
    "we can consider the purification process of an entangled state between qubit@xmath68 and qubit@xmath69 using qubit@xmath70 and qubit@xmath71 , by controlling the four couplers that exist between each pair of neighboring qubits .",
    "if we use experimental values @xmath72  mhz  @xcite and a single qubit frequency of 1  ghz  @xcite , the gate times are @xmath73  nsec and @xmath63  psec .",
    "thus , @xmath74  nsec and @xmath75  nsec , for a qubit dephasing time of 500  nsec . depending on the measurement time",
    ", we can probably carry out more than one purification process well within the qubit coherent time .",
    "after the purification process , we measure the ` source ' qubits .",
    "if the measured results are in the @xmath76 or @xmath77 states , we can expect that the entangled state has been improved . otherwise , we restart the whole process by again preparing mixed states for the two pairs .",
    "\\(4 ) for charge qubits based on capacitively - coupled single - electron qds , the inter - qubit xy interaction appears in a rotating reference frame when an oscillating gate bias is applied  @xcite . for coupled qds where the radius of each qd is about 2.5  nm and",
    "the distance between qubits is about 12  nm , @xmath78  mev and @xmath79  mev .",
    "if we assume that we can switch on and off the coupling between qds , we have @xmath80  psec and @xmath81  psec for a dephasing time of 100 nsec  @xcite .",
    "we have shown how to effectively reduce the number of operational steps in the purification protocol . in any stage of quantum communication ,",
    "all efforts to speed up each process are strongly recommended from the viewpoint of finite coherence time as well as user s satisfaction .",
    "the recent cavity - qed techniques using superconducting circuits have realized the strong coupling between the cavity - mode and the qubit  @xcite .",
    "the present method of reducing the number of operations is effective for all qubits with xy interaction and would be of great use to realize quantum communication .",
    "one of the possible quantum communication systems contains local quantum computers based on cavity - qed mechanism and an optical fiber using photons .",
    "this is because the optical fibers would be the lowest cost and most effective medium between distant parties , and the cavity - qed mechanism is effective to connect photon to a local electronic system  @xcite .",
    "thus , the effective transformation between local quantum states and photons is desirable .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have succeeded in controlling microwave photons in a superconducting circuit based on charge qubits . on the other hand , qds are also good resources of entangled photon states  @xcite .",
    "more experiments regarding the emission and absorption of photons between the local cavity - qed system and the external photonic system are desired .    in section  [ sec - example ] , we have shown four examples of applying the proposed purification protocols to solid state qubits .",
    "the bottom line of using the purification protocol is whether we can prepare mixed states in which the probability of the desired bell state is more than 1/2 . at the first stage of quantum communication , we try to generate desired entangled states .",
    "however , those states are mostly imperfect and decohere gradually . if the probabilities of those entangled states are more than 1/2 even after passing through noisy channels , we can apply the purification protocol on those impure pairs . in order to repeat the next purification process",
    ", the time @xmath82 @xmath83 should be sufficiently smaller than the coherence time ( @xmath84 is a measurement time for judging the two - qubit states , which is , for example , 1@xmath5610  msec in ref .",
    "otherwise , it is possible that the revised fidelity by the purification is smaller than that of the original state . in the third example in section  [ sec - example ] , for the second purification process , we have to generate a new mixed state from the measured qubits ( called ` source ' qubits ) .",
    "the measured qubits are in a product state , @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "first , we try to make a desired entangled state using the method mentioned in section  [ sec - bell ] .",
    "if the noisy environment successfully changes the imperfect entangled state into a mixed state with @xmath87 in eq.([eq_bennett ] ) , we can proceed to the next purification .",
    "otherwise , we have to apply random @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 rotations . because it takes a time @xmath91 for each rotation , the total time to carry out the second purification process is given by @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is an integer for the randomization ) .",
    "this time should be smaller than that of the coherence time of the other surviving qubit  ( called ` target ' qubit ) that is waiting for the new entangled qubit . whether these purification protocols succeed or not seems to strongly depend on each decoherence mechanism .    in this paper",
    ", we did not include any quantum error - correcting code in the purification protocol .",
    "this is because the quantum error - correcting code requires many qubits , in contrast to the current experimental situation with very few solid - state qubits .",
    "how to effectively combine the proposed purification process with the various quantum error - correcting codes would be an important issue for future studies .",
    "in summary , we have constructed an efficient adaptation of the entanglement purification protocols for qubits with xy interactions .",
    "specifically , we show that the conventional cnot gate , which requires turning on _ two_-qubit interactions _",
    "twice _ , can be replaced by a _ single _ iswap gate together with single - qubit rotations .",
    "this simplification of the gate pulse sequence reduces the time for entanglement purification and increases the robustness of the protocols .",
    "our method could be used for any qubits with xy interactions , particularly cavity - coupled qubits , which allows solid - state qubits to be more easily integrable into a quantum communication network .",
