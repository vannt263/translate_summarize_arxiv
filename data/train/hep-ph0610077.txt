    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the most popular extension of the standard model ( sm ) on account of four attractive features@xcite .",
    "it provides ( 1 ) a natural solution to the hierarchy problem of the sm , ( 2 ) a natural ( radiative ) mechanism for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , ( 3 ) a natural candidate for the cold dark matter ( dm ) of the universe in the form of the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) , a prediction that has gained in importance in view of recent observations@xcite , and ( 4 ) unification of the sm gauge couplings at the gut scale .",
    "however it also suffers from two problems : + ( i ) little hierarchy problem : the lep limit on the mass of an sm - like higgs boson@xcite , m_h > 114  gev , [ higgs ] requires the average top squark mass to be typically an order magnitude higher than @xmath4@xcite .",
    "this implies some fine - tuning of susy parameters to obtain the correct value of @xmath4 .",
    "+ ( ii ) flavour and cp violation problem : the general mssm makes fairly large 1-loop contributions to flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes , like @xmath5 decay , as well as to cp violating processes like fermion electric dipole moments ( edm ) .",
    "the experimental limits on these fcnc decays require either large scalar masses , m _",
    "10  tev [ scalar_minlmt ] or a near degeneracy among the sfermion masses of different generations .",
    "similarly , the experimental limits on the electron and neutron edm require either large scalar masses ( as in eq.[scalar_minlmt ] ) or unnaturally small cp violating phases .",
    "it may be added here that while the degeneracy of sfermion masses can be realised in simple models like minimal supergravity ( msugra ) or anomaly mediated susy breaking ( mamsb ) , there is no simple model ensuring small susy phases .",
    "the split susy model@xcite tries to solve the second problem at the cost of aggravating the first by pushing up the scalar superparticle masses .",
    "in fact the cost is much more , since this model assumes the scalar masses to be many orders of magnitude larger than the tev scale .",
    "this means that one has to give up ( 1 ) the supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy problem of the sm along with ( 2 ) the radiative ewsb mechanism .",
    "one only retains the lsp dark matter and the unification of gauge couplings , since the chargino and the neutralino masses are assumed to remain within a few tev .",
    "we find the cost much too high since the first two features were the original motivations for weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "we shall consider instead a more conservative model where the scalar superparticle masses are assumed to lie in the range m _",
    "= 10 -100  tev .",
    "[ scalarlimit ] thus , it solves the second problem at the cost of aggravating the first ; but without abandoning the supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy problem or the radiative ewsb mechanism .",
    "moreover , we retain the lsp dark matter as well as gauge coupling unification by assuming the chargino and neutralino masses to remain within a few tev",
    ".    we shall be primarily interested in the electroweak chargino - neutralino sector and in particular the lightest neutralino , which we assume to be the lsp .",
    "the diagonal elements of the @xmath6 neutralino mass matrix are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , corresponding to the bino @xmath9 , the wino @xmath10 , and the higgsinos @xmath11 , respectively , while the non - diagonal elements are all @xmath12 .",
    "now , there are experimental indications from the higgs mass limit ( eq .  [ higgs ] ) and the @xmath13 decay width that the susy masses representing the above diagonal elements are typically larger than @xmath4 , at least in a universal mssm like the msugra model@xcite .",
    "we shall assume this mass inequality to hold in a more general mssm .",
    "then it implies that the neutralino mass eigenstates correspond approximately to the above interaction eigenstates @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 and the lsp constitutes of one of these states . an interesting exception to this rule",
    "is provided by the case of a near degeneracy between two diagonal elements , which results in a large mixing between the corresponding interaction eigenstates , as the mixing angle is given by @xmath15 .",
    "in particular the lsp can be a mixed bino - higgsino , bino - wino or wino - higgsino state .",
    "such mixed lsp cases have been investigated in ref.@xcite , and named `` well - tempered '' neutralino in ref.@xcite .",
    "leaving aside such an accidental degeneracy between the two lightest mass eigenvalues , one expects the lsp to be approximated by one of the interaction states - bino , wino or higgsino .",
    "the bino carries no gauge charge and hence does not couple to gauge bosons .",
    "thus it can only pair - annihilate via sfermion exchange .",
    "but the current experimental lower limits on the sfermion masses@xcite imply a low annihilation rate , resulting in an overabundance of dark matter over most of the mssm parameter space . only in special regions like",
    "stau co - annihilation ( @xmath16 ) or resonant pair annihilation ( @xmath17 ) can one get a cosmologically acceptable dm relic density .",
    "but neither of these regions extend to the scalar mass range of eq.([scalarlimit ] ) .",
    "even the so called focus point region , which corresponds to a `` well - tempered '' bino - higgsino lsp , does not reach the scalar mass range of eq.[scalarlimit ] in the universal mssm@xcite , although , in a generic and unconstrained mssm , it can obtain the correct dm relic density for very large scalar masses@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the higgsino and wino carry isospins @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "hence they can pair annihilate to ww(|f f ) ,   ww(|f f ) , [ hig - win - ann ] by their gauge couplings to w boson .",
    "consequently , the annihilation rate and the resulting dm relic density is controlled mainly by the higgsino ( wino ) lsp mass .",
    "it has only a marginal dependence on the sfermion mass@xcite and it is practically independent of the other susy parameters .",
    "the current wmap result on the dm relic density alongwith the @xmath20 error bar@xcite is _",
    "^+0.015 _ -0.019 [ relicdensity ] where @xmath21 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath22@xcite and @xmath23 is the dm relic density in units of the critical density .",
    "this corresponds to a higgsino ( wino ) lsp mass of about @xmath24 tev , where the larger wino mass is due to its larger gauge coupling . in ref.@xcite",
    "we investigated the phenomenology of higgsino lsp in collider and dark matter experiments .",
    "the present work is devoted to a similar investigation for the wino lsp .    in the next section",
    ", we discuss the wino lsp models and estimate the wino mass band compatible with the wmap relic density range of eq.[relicdensity ] . in the two following sections we investigate the prospects of detecting such a heavy wino lsp in future collider and dm search experiments respectively .",
    "finally we shall conclude with a summary of our results .",
    "a universal gaugino mass at the gut scale leads to the weak scale wino being always heavier than the bino , since the gaugino masses evolve like the corresponding gauge couplings .",
    "hence , the wino lsp scenario can not be realised in the universal mssm .",
    "the most popular susy model for a wino lsp is the anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) model@xcite wherein the gaugino and scalar masses arise from supergravity breaking in the hidden sector via super - weyl anomaly contributions@xcite , namely , m_= m_3/2 [ gauginoreln ] m^2_=- ( _ g+ _ y ) m^2_3/2 [ scalar_gaugino ] a_y=- m_3/2 . [ a - gaugino ] here @xmath25 is the gravitino mass , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the @xmath28 functions for gauge and yukawa couplings , and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the wave function renormalization constant .",
    "the gut scale gaugino masses ( [ gauginoreln ] ) are thus non - universal , with m_1= m_3/2  , m_2= m_3/2  , m_3=-3 m_3/2 [ gauginonu ] at the one loop level .",
    "evolving down to the weak scale gives m_1 : m_2 : |m_3| 2.8 : 1 : 7.1 [ gaugino - ratio ] including the two loop corrections .",
    "unfortunately , evolving the scalar masses of eq.([scalar_gaugino ] ) down to the weak scale gives negative mass - square values for sleptons . in the minimal version of the model ( mamsb )",
    "this is remedied by adding a common parameter @xmath31 to the right hand side of eq.([scalar_gaugino ] ) for all the scalars in the theory .",
    "this model has been widely studied because of its economy of parameters , _",
    "m_3/2 ,  m_0 ,  , sgn ( ) [ gutinput ] @xmath32 being fixed by the radiative ewsb condition .",
    "we shall come back to this model below .",
    "it should be noted here that the anomaly mediated contributions of eqs.([gauginoreln],[scalar_gaugino],[a - gaugino ] ) are present in all supergravity models .",
    "but , in general , one can also have tree level susy breaking contributions to the gaugino and scalar masses arising from possible dimension five and six terms in the effective lagrangian , namely m _ [ lambdafield ] and m^2 _ ^[phifield ] where @xmath33 is the vev of the @xmath34 component of a chiral superfield @xmath35 responsible for susy breaking .",
    "if present , these tree level contributions are expected to overwhelm the anomaly mediated contributions of eqs.([gauginoreln ] & [ scalar_gaugino ] ) .",
    "the amsb scenario assumes the susy breaking superfield to be carrying a non - zero gauge charge , so that the gaugino mass term ( eq.[lambdafield ] ) is eliminated by gauge symmetry .",
    "however , such symmetry considerations can not eliminate the tree level scalar mass term ( eq.[phifield ] ) .",
    "so in this case the scalar mass is expected to be typically larger than the gaugino mass by a loop factor , namely m_~100 m _  .",
    "[ philambda ]    this was the case in the amsb model of ref.@xcite which has been revived in ref.@xcite . on the other hand , the mamsb model @xcite assumes the susy - breaking hidden sector and the visible sector to reside on two different branes , separated by a large distance in a higher dimensional space , so that the tree level scalar mass term ( eq.[phifield ] ) is suppressed by geometric considerations .",
    "we shall consider both the possibilities here .",
    "note also that one can get a amsb like scenario in the string theory , where the tree - level susy breaking masses can only come from the dilaton field , while they receive only loop contributions from moduli fields .",
    "in fact , such a scenario was already suggested in ref.@xcite before the amsb model by assuming that susy breaking is dominated by a modulus field .",
    "it contributes to the gaugino mass @xmath36 as well as the squared scalar mass @xmath37 at the 1-loop level .",
    "the resulting hierarchy of gaugino masses is very similar to that of the amsb ( [ gauginonu ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the scalar mass here is expected to be typically larger than the gaugino mass by the square root of the loop factor , _",

    ". the lower end of wino mass corresponds to slepton and squark masses in the range of @xmath55 tev , while the upper end corresponds to these masses in the range of @xmath56 tev .",
    "all these results are very insensitive to changes in @xmath47 and @xmath57 .",
    "it should be noted here that the region below the wmap compatible wino mass band of eq.[m2-amsblmt ] corresponds to an under - abundance of the dm relic density in the standard cosmological model .",
    "this region may be allowed if there are alternative dm candidates , or , more interestingly , if there are non - standard cosmological mechanisms for enhancing the relic density of the wino dm .",
    "in fact , both thermal and non - thermal mechanisms for enhancing the wino relic density have been suggested in the literature@xcite . in the first case",
    ", the presence of a quintessence field leads to faster hubble expansion and hence an earlier freeze - out , resulting in a higher thermal relic density @xcite . in the second case , late decay of the gravitino enhances the wino relic density in the amsb model @xcite .",

    "given the modest energy resolution of the present act experiments ( @xmath131 ) , it may be more difficult to extract a line @xmath0 ray signal at the @xmath128 level in the presence of this @xmath0 ray background .",
    "therefore it is imperative to improve the energy and angular resolution of these experiments to suppress this background ; and also to look for other possible clumps of dm in galactic halo@xcite .",
    "we point out here that in our discussion we have considered the neutrino and gamma ray signals to probe the known sources of dm concentration like the solar and the galactic cores because of their directionality . on the other hand the dm annihilation in the galactic halo",
    "can also be probed via the positron and the anti - proton channels as discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "indirect detection of wino as a dark matter candidate satisfying wmap data via cosmic ray positron and anti - proton fluxes particularly becomes more interesting because of non - perturbative enhancement of cross - sections@xcite .",
    "we shall conclude with a brief discussion of the non - perturbative contribution to the annihilation cross - sections of tev scale wino lsp and its impact on our results .",
    "the non perturbative contributions coming from the s - channel bound states , as calculated in @xcite via an effective potential , leads to a large enhancement of the wino pair annihilation cross - section into ww and @xmath0-@xmath0 channels . in a recent work of non - perturbative calculation@xcite",
    "the above authors have computed the velocity averaged wino pair annhilation cross - section at the freeze - out temperature and the resulting wino relic density .",
    "they show a @xmath13250% reduction of the thermal abundance , with respect to the perturbative value corresponding to @xmath132600  gev or a @xmath13225% increase in the wino mass satisfying the wmap relic density .",
    "the collider signal for such a wino lsp will require a proportionate @xmath13225% of the clic beam energy .",
    "on the other hand the line @xmath0-ray signal will be larger that that shown in fig .",

    "\\2 ) the wmap constraint on the dm relic density implies a heavy wino lsp mass of @xmath133 tev in the standard cosmology .",
