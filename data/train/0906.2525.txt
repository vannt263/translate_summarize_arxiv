    "inflation has become a major paradigm for explaining the very early universe that is consistent with the observations , and current observations of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) support the scale - invariant and gaussian spectrum that is expected from the standard inflation scenario . however , there are some anomalies in the spectrum , such as a small departure from the exact scale - invariance or a certain non - gaussian character@xcite , which are expected to reveal the dynamics of the fields that are responsible for the inflation .",
    "an obvious example is the observation of a small shift in the spectrum index @xmath2 , which suggests that there is a small departure from the scale - invariant evolution and which has been used to constrain the inflation potential @xcite .",

    "the calculation in terms of the modulated inflation scenario is thus very simple and straightforward compared with other calculations , which are based on the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation or the time - derivative of the comoving curvature perturbation on spatially flat slice .",
    "the reason for @xmath85 is very clear in this scenario .",
    "the constancy of the curvature perturbation is violated due to the inhomogeneities of the inflaton velocity @xmath86 , which is caused by the entropy field .",

    ", it is found that the second - order perturbation of the potential with respect to the field @xmath9 leads to @xmath90      the bend of the trajectory is important since the velocity perturbation @xmath91 can become non - zero near the bend , even if it arises late after the horizon exit . at the bend of the trajectory ,",
    "the velocity perturbation is given by @xmath92 in addition to the inhomogeneities that may appear at large scales , there are small - scale ( i.e. , decaying ) inhomogeneities of the inflaton velocity that can be related to the inhomogeneities in the slow - rolling velocity @xmath93 which decays at large scales as @xmath94@xcite .",
    "the correction from such small - scale inhomogeneities can be dubbed non - equilibrium corrections , which may become additional source of the curvature perturbation .",
    "more specifically , eq . ( [ decay - fl - vel ] ) suggests that @xmath91 soon decays to reach @xmath95 after the horizon exit , and that at large scales the inflation velocity perturbations do not lead to significant evolution @xmath85 except for the place where the inflation trajectory is curved .",
    "the velocity perturbation may have a decaying component accompanied by a significant decay factor @xmath96@xcite . in what follows",
    "we show why the corrections added by the decaying perturbations can not be disregarded .    first , the small - scale inhomogeneities may affect the curvature perturbations at least just after horizon crossing .",
    "then , we know that the perturbations added at small scales will be frozen at large scales .",
    "therefore , if the small - scale corrections are significant , they can be observed in the present universe .",
    "note that the factor @xmath97 in the integral with respect to the time coordinate does not always lead to strong suppression in the result .",
    "for the simplest example , the following integral is considered @xmath98 which is such that no exponential suppression remains after integration .    to show explicitly the significant effect from the decaying component in the modulated inflation velocity , here a very simple mechanism is considered to add a large non - gaussian effect to the conventional inflationary perturbation .",
    "consider the standard hybrid - type inflation with a non - standard interaction with addition scalar fields @xmath99 ; @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes an intermediate mass scale .",
    "the inflaton potential during inflation is given by @xmath102 in this model the adiabatic inflaton field is @xmath103 .",
    "enhanced symmetric point ( esp ) at @xmath104 is defined as the point where the scalar fields @xmath99 become ( temporarily ) massless during inflation .",
    "the inhomogeneities in @xmath105 caused by the light fields @xmath99 lead to the small - scale velocity perturbation @xmath106 where @xmath4 is the number of massless fields at the esp . note that there is no bend in the classical ( unperturbed ) trajectory in this model .",
    "the small - scale inhomogeneities of the inflaton velocity thus lead to the correction given by @xmath107 which can be very large when the inflaton passes through the esp at @xmath108 . considering the standard curvature perturbations",
    "@xmath109 , we find @xmath110 it is useful to specify the level of non - gaussianity by the non - linear parameter @xmath111 , which is usually defined by the bardeen potential @xmath112 , @xmath113 using the bardeen potential , the curvature perturbation @xmath22 is given by @xmath114 when we consider `` additional '' non - gaussianity created at the esp , the first - order perturbation is generated dominantly by the usual inflaton perturbation @xmath115 .",

    "again , what is important in this argument is that decaying - components of the velocity perturbation may cause significant anomalies in the spectrum , which may be seen in some non - linear parameter or in some other cosmological parameters as a signature of massless excitations during inflation .    before closing this section",
    ", it would be useful to compare our model with a model with a step ( or a spike ) in the potential@xcite .",
    "a step in the potential leads to a time - dependent slow - roll parameters , which causes @xmath123 for a single - field inflation model . in this case",
    "the origin of the higher order perturbations are terms proportional to @xmath124 or @xmath125 , which are not important in the smooth potential but can cause significant non - gaussianity at the step .",
    "the obvious discrepancy between the model with step and our model with esp is that in the former model the origin of the non - gaussianity is @xmath126 or @xmath127 , while in the latter model the origin is the second - order perturbation in the velocity .",
    "therefore , these two effects appear separately in the calculation and give independent results for non - linear parameters . in fact , in the present model @xmath124 and @xmath125 at the 0-th order are very small at the esp .      in addition to the non - equilibrium correction from the modulated inflaton velocity",

    "allowing a short period of deviation from the slow - roll , the most significant effect may occur when the inflaton temporarily stops . expressing the conventional curvature perturbation for slow - roll inflation as @xmath129 , the divergence is brought about by @xmath130 in the denominator . to understand the correction from @xmath128",
