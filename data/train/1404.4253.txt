    "<S> while for the na - system a drastic reduction of @xmath6 indicates a suppression of the average magnetic couplings by dilution , @xmath6 remains unchanged in case of the li - system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for the li - system the signatures of sg formation extend to large @xmath84 , where signatures of a smeared qpt are observed . </S>",
    "<S> although we could not study na@xmath0(ir@xmath1ti@xmath2)o@xmath3  at large @xmath23 , the evolution of the magnetic coupling strength ( from @xmath6 ) suggests that the qpt for this system is located at significantly lower @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> recently classical monte - carlo simulations on depleted next neighbor hk and @xmath13-@xmath14-@xmath15 heisenberg models found that in the former case sg freezing disappears beyond the site percolation threshold @xmath85 while in the latter case with substantial further neighbor couplings it persists much beyond @xmath86  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with our data suggests that na@xmath0iro@xmath3  is governed dominantly by the nearest neighbor hk model whereas for the li - system interactions beyond nearest neighbor are significantly important . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath87 is the site percolation threshold for a triangular lattice and for @xmath14 exchange only , the honeycomb system corresponds to two decoupled triangular lattices . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observed smeared qpt must be associated with further neighbor interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we also note , that recent theoretical work related to li@xmath0iro@xmath3 found that the low-@xmath88 spiral ordering in combination with the af weiss temperature @xmath89  k requires a model with second neighbor kitaev and heisenberg interactions  @xcite .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have found differing behaviors in depleted honeycomb na@xmath0iro@xmath3  and li@xmath0iro@xmath3 which suggests the importance of substantial further neighbor magnetic interactions for li@xmath0iro@xmath3 . in  li@xmath0(ir@xmath1ti@xmath2)o@xmath3  </S>",
    "<S> sg freezing persists to a regime at @xmath84 for which indications of a smeared quantum phase transition is observed . </S>",
    "<S> magnetism in this interesting regime could be further investigated by nmr , @xmath90sr or neutron scattering .    </S>",
