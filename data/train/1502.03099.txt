    "in our current understanding of the universe , an unknown substance called dark matter dominates over the standard model particles at the present epoch . despite many theoretical and observational efforts , the origin of dark matter",
    "is not yet clarified .",
    "also , the existence of dark energy , which is supposed to drive the cosmic acceleration , indicates our incomplete understanding of the gravity on cosmological scales  @xcite .",
    "it may imply modifications to einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "a further insight into the origin and nature of dark energy or validity of general relativity is essential , and this is one of the primary goals in next - generation cosmology .",
    "the large - scale structure offers an opportunity to probe these issues by looking at the anisotropic galaxy clustering in redshift space  @xcite .",
    "the observed galaxy distribution via the spectroscopic measurements is apparently distorted due to the peculiar velocity of galaxies along the line - of - sight direction , referred to as the redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) . while the rsd complicates the interpretation of the small - scale galaxy clustering , on large scales , the strength of anisotropies is simply characterized by the linear growth rate @xmath0 @xcite , providing us a unique opportunity to probe the growth of structure , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the linear density field and scale factor of the universe , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the large - scale galaxy clustering data imprints a fossil record of the primeval baryon - photon fluid around the last - scattering surface , known as the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao )  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic scale of the bao can be used as a standard ruler , which enables us to determine the geometric distances of high-@xmath3 galaxies with a greater precision . the key point to determine the geometric distances is to measure the clustering anisotropies over the bao scales .",
    "notice the fact that the anisotropies of the clustering pattern also arises from the apparent mismatch of the underlying cosmological model when we convert the redshift and angular position of each galaxy to the co - moving radial and transverse distances .",
    "this is the so - called alcock - paczynski ( a - p ) effect  @xcite , and with a prior knowledge of the characteristic scale of the bao , the hubble parameter @xmath4 and angular diameter distance @xmath5 of the high-@xmath3 galaxies can be separately measured .",
    "thus , the anisotropic galaxy clustering can serve as a dual cosmological probe from which we can explore the origin of cosmic acceleration from the viewpoint of both dark energy and modification of gravity .    in order to simultaneously extract information on both",
    "the growth of structure and cosmic expansion , a detailed theoretical model of the anisotropic clustering is crucial .",
    "while the scales of our interest are rather close to the linear regime of structure formation , there appear small but non - negligible nonlinear systematics that must be corrected or subtracted , and these including the nonlinear gravitational clustering .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why perturbation theory has become very popular recently as a theoretical template of the power spectrum or correlation function beyond the linear theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "still , however , perturbation theory has its own limitations , and we can not apply it to the small scales beyond the weakly nonlinear regime . furthermore , the rsd described by the nonlinear mapping from the real to redshift spaces , gives an additional complication that leads to the non - trivial cross talk between small- and large - scale clustering . as a result , even at large scales ,",
    "the clustering amplitude is significantly reduced along the line of sight , known as the finger - of - god effect . while several treatments , based on perturbation theory , have been proposed in order to precisely model the nonlinear rsd ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the finger - of - god effect , being most likely ascribed to the virialized random motion the galaxies inside halos , prevents us from a detailed modeling within perturbation theory .",
    "hence , a phenomenological description characterizing the finger - of - god suppression needs to be introduced , and in order to avoid any unwanted systematics , we have to conservatively restrict the cosmological data analysis to the larger scales , @xmath6 , for instance . this , needless to say ,",
    "significantly reduces the statistical power to constrain dark energy or to test general relativity .    in the persuit of extracting maximal cosmological information from the anisotropic galaxy clustering data",
    ", a simple but potentially powerful approach is to make use of the benefit of combining both the power spectrum and bispectrum on large scales .",
    "although the initial condition for perturbations is supposed to be nearly gaussian , non ",
    "vanishing bisepctrum naturally arises from the nonlinear mode coupling through the late - time gravitational evolution . at the weakly nonlinear regime ,",
    "the bispectrum still contains statistical information similar to the power spectrum , and thus the bao feature should be clearly manifest .",
    "hence , the bispectrum in redshift space , as an actual observable , can be used as an alternative tool to constrain the geometric distances and growth of structure via the a - p effect and rsd .",
    "thus , in combining the bispectrum and the power spectrum , we expect a substantial on the resultant cosmological constraints . indeed , in the context of cosmology with galaxy redshift surveys , the benefit of using the bispectrum in cosmological data analysis has already been studied in several work ( e.g. , @xcite ) . among these ,",
    "sefusatti , crocce , pueblas @xmath7 scoccimarro  @xcite focused on the angle - averaged bispectrum in redshift space , and discussed a potential power of bispectrum to constrain multiple cosmological parameters , ignoring a - p effect . on the other hand ,",
    "taking fully account of both the a - p effect and rsd , greig , komatsu @xmath7 whyithe  @xcite considered cosmology with ly@xmath8 emitting galaxies , and specifically studied the impact of radiative transfer effects on the observed clustering of ly@xmath8 emitting galaxies .",
    "it has been shown that the bispectrum is helpful to distinguish between gravitational and non - gravitational effects , thus breaking the parameter degeneracies .    in this paper",
    ", we present the combined results of the power spectrum and bispectrum to constrain the geometric distances and growth of structure .",
    "the present paper is partly similar to  @xcite , but is rather different in several aspects . to be specific",
    ", we consider a future accessible spectroscopic survey like dark energy spectroscopy instrument ( hereafter desi ) , which would be the best suited to probe the cosmic acceleration around @xmath9 . considering this survey setup",
    ", we discuss the impact of the finger - of - god effect on the estimation of cosmological parameters , which has not been considered in  @xcite .",
    "we show that while the uncertainty of the finger - of - god effect in power spectrum is mostly degenerate with the coherent motion as a probe of the growth of structure , the combination of power spectrum and bispectrum breaks this degeneracy , thus improving the measurement accuracy of the coherent motion by a factor of two . as for the constraints on geometric distances ,",
    "substantial improvement is found , consistent with previous works .",
    "furthermore , the role of the non - vanishing cross covariance between power spectrum and bispectrum is studied , and the relative impact in estimating statistical errors is quantified , finding that the influence of cross covariance is small enough in the weakly nonlinear regime .",

    "[ sec : constraints ] , the basic setup of the forecast analysis is presented .",
    "based on perturbation theory , theoretical models for power spectrum and bispectrum are given , taking account of both the a - p effect and rsd .",
    "then , the basic formalism for fisher matrix analysis is described , including the cross covariance between power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "[ sec : results ] presents the main results for fisher matrix analysis . after comparing the signal - to - noise ratios of power spectrum with those of bispectrum",
    ", we show the expected constraints on geometric distances ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and growth of structure @xmath12 in desi - like experiments .",
    "the impact of finger - of - god effect is discussed in detail , and role of the bispectrum is clarified .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "on large scales of our interest , the density and velocity fields are basically the small perturbations to the homogenous background .",
    "when the higher - order contributions are ignorable , the power spectrum is simply described by the linear theory , and in redshift space , it is given by [ eq : kaiser ] ^lin ( ) = z_1 ^ 2()p(k ) , where @xmath13 is defined by , z_1()b+f^2 .",
    "the linear galaxy bias , denoted by @xmath14 , represents the enhancement of the clustering amplitude relative to the mass density field @xmath1 . the function @xmath12 is defined by the logarithmic derivative of the linear density field with respect to the logarithm of scale factor , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "the directional vector @xmath16 is decomposed into @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the cosine of angle to the line of sight .    in practice ,",
    "the applicability of the linear theory expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kaiser ] ) is restricted to a narrow range of scales .",
    "this is because the mapping of statistical quantities from real to redshift space is intrinsically nonlinear . even at large scales , higher - order contributions to the mapping formula are not negligible .",
    "for this reason , there have been several improved models of rsd that have been proposed that add correction terms to the kaiser formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kaiser ] ) . taking account of those effects is thus crucial and essential for an unbiased parameter estimation in the practical data analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimation of statistical errors is not usually much dependent on those elaborate factorized formulations , because the statistical error of each parameter mainly comes from the measurement uncertainties , including the cosmic variance and shot noise .",
    "unless a significant contribution of higher - order corrections arises , the structure of parameter degeneracies will remain unchanged .",
    "hence , in this paper , we do not consider such higher - order corrections .",
    "nevertheless , the suppression of clustering amplitude due to the random motion is known as a non  perturbative effect , which significantly affects the power spectrum even at large scales , and should be accounted in the basic formulation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kaiser ] ) . here",
    ", we assume that this fog is given as a factorized form , and multiplied as ( e.g. , @xcite ) : [ eq : fullpks ] ( ) = d^p_fog()^lin ( ) .",
    "the @xmath19 is given by the gaussian form as , [ eq : fogpower ] d^p_fog ( ) = exp , [ eq : fog_power ] where @xmath20 denotes the dispersion of the one - point pdf of the velocity in one - dimension .",
    "note that at smaller scales , the virial motion of galaxies inside a cluster of galaxies also leads to a suppression of the power spectrum in redshift space .",
    "when @xmath21 , the leading order term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullpks ] ) is dominant over all other higher orders , and the estimated errors are immune from the exact functional form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullpks ] ) .",
    "the linear @xmath20 is used for the fiducial value .",
    "while the initial condition for perturbations is assumed to be gaussian , gravitational evolution naturally induces mode - mode coupling , giving rise to the non - vanishing bispectrum .",
    "furthermore , coupled with galaxy bias and rsd , the bispectrum in redshift space becomes rather complicated .",
    "the resultant leading - order expression for the bispectrum  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , valid at large scales , is given by , [ eq : bilinear ] ^pt ( _ 1,_2,_3)&=&2the kernel @xmath22 is defined as , z_2(_i,_j)&&+bf_2(_i,_j ) + f_ij^2g_2(_i,_j ) + & + & , where we define @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being the line - of - sight unit vector . here",
    ", we incorporate the uncertainty of the nonlinear galaxy bias characterized by @xmath27 into the kernel @xmath22 , adopting the local bias prescription ( e.g. , @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath28 . in the above ,",
    "the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the standard pt kernel in real space , given by , f_2(_i,_j)&= & + ( + ) + _ ij^2 + g_2(_i,_j)&= & + ( + ) + _ ij^2 . with @xmath31 .",
    "note that the configuration of bispectrum satisfies the triangular condition , which is expressed by the directional vector constraint , [ eq : biconfig ] _",
    "1+_2+_3 = 0 .",
    "in contrast to the redshift - space power spectrum , the influence of nonlinear rsd on eq .",
    "( [ eq : bilinear ] ) is not yet fully understood and studied in detail .",
    "although it deserves further investigation , we can make the best guess on the possible damping effect due to the random motion of galaxy .",
    "the fog effect in the bispectrum is assumed to be gaussian as @xcite , [ eq : fogbi ] d^b_fog(_1,_2,_3 ) = exp .",
    "[ eq : fog_bispec ] then the observed bispectrum is given by , [ eq : bifull ] ( _ 1,_2,_3)=d^b_fog(_1,_2,_3)^pt ( _ 1,_2,_3 ) .",
    "again , when @xmath21 , the detailed functional form of @xmath32 is not important for our estimation .",
    "in addition to the anisotropies induced by the rsd , the observed galaxy clustering also exhibits anisotropies through the alcock - paczynski ( a - p ) effect .",
    "this can happen if the background expansion of the real universe differs from the fiducial cosmology used to convert the redshift and angular position of each galaxy to the co - moving radial and transverse distances .    while this effect leads to the modulation in the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum and bispectrum ,",
    "if the shape of these quantities is a priori known , it offers a unique opportunity to measure the angular diameter distance @xmath5 and hubble parameter @xmath4 of distant galaxies at redshift @xmath3 using the characteristic shape of the galaxy clustering in both the radial and transverse directions .",
    "furthermore , providing information on the evolution of density and velocity fields , the two types of apparent anisotropies ( i.e. , rsd and a - p effects ) become distinguishable , and the geometric distances @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be separately and accurately determined .",
    "this is indeed possible if we know at least the broadband shape of spectrum . in other words , given a accurate theoretical template which describes the broadband shape of the power spectrum and bispectrum , the simultaneous constraints on the geometric distances and growth of structure are made possible .",
    "we dub this method as a broadband a - p test  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropies in the power spectrum caused by the a - p effect are modeled as follows . denoting the true power spectrum by @xmath33 ,",
    "the observed power spectrum becomes ^obs ( k , ) = ( ) ( ) ^2 ( q , ) , [ eq : pk_obs ] where @xmath17 denotes the fiducial coordinates for the underlying cosmological model , and @xmath34 represents the coordinates in the _ true _ cosmology .",
    "the a - p effect for bispectrum is also modeled in a similar way , and the resultant shape of bispectrum depends on five parameters , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "the observed bispectrum is thus related to the true one given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bifull ] ) through , ^obs(k_1,k_2,k_3,_1,_2)&=&()^2 ( ) ^4 + & & ( q_1,q_2,q_3,_1,_2 ) .",

    ", we define @xmath31 .      in this paper , to elucidate the potential power of the bispectrum to constrain cosmology , we shall specifically consider desi as a representative future galaxy survey , and proceed to the fisher matrix analysis .",
    "the primary science goal of the desi experiment is to clarify the nature of dark energy and/or gravity through the a - p and rsd effects , and starting in 2018 , it will obtain optical spectra for tens of millions of galaxies and quasars , constructing a 3-dimensional map spanning the nearby universe to 10 billion light years .",

    ", we will ignore the off - diagonal components of the covariance matrices arising mainly from the nonlinear mode coupling .",
    "this would certainly lead to an optimistic estimation of the parameter constraints , however , it has been shown that in the case of power spectrum , the non - gaussian error contribution to the off - diagonal components are small enough , and the diagonal components of the covariance matrix can be approximately described by the simple gaussian contribution @xcite .",
    "this would be true as long as we consider the quasi - linear scales at moderately high redshift ( say , @xmath40 and @xmath41mpc@xmath42 ) . the parameter estimation study with non - gaussian covariance further revealed that the size of the constraints on each parameter is not drastically changed if we consider the multiple parameter estimation ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",

    "the survey volume is derived by calculating the co - moving shell in each redshift bin , and multiply by fractional factor from desi @xmath44 . the gaussian contribution to the covariance matrix for bispectrum",

    "note that similar to the constraints on the geometric distance , the effect of the off - diagonal components of the error covariance are insignificant in the case of @xmath12 and @xmath20 , and it does not appreciably change the results . in the upper panel ,",
    "we plot @xmath12 for different theoretical models .",
    "the black dotted and dash curves represent @xmath12 for dark energy models with @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that we are able to constrain the dark energy from the measured @xmath12 alone .",
    "also , the red long dash curve represents @xmath12 of dgp model  @xcite , demonstrating the outperformance of the stage - iv class survey .    finally , to see the impact of the fog effect on the measurement of the growth rate , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnofog ] the marginalized constraints of @xmath12 in the case when we know the fog effect a priori .",
    "as it is expected , the parameter @xmath12 is better constrained , and the precision reaches at @xmath95 level .",
    "one notable and interesting point is that the power spectrum always gives a tighter constraint , and combination of power spectrum and bispectrum does not improve much the constraint .",
    "thus , the benefit of using the bispectrum is substantially reduced .",
    "the combination of power spectrum and bispectrum has been frequently used in the literature to constrain the bias parameters ( e.g. , @xcite for recent results ) . with the survey like desi ,",
    "the constraint on these parameter will become much more tigher .",
    "this is true even if we simultaneously estimate the expansion history and growth of structure .",
    "[ fig : bias ] shows the forecast result of the statistical errors on galaxy bias parameters .",
    "the upper panel presents the constraint on the linear bias parameter @xmath14",
    ". the linear bias is tightly constrained by the power spectrum depicted as dotted line , and no benefit to use the bispectrum is found ( dashed ) , although the combination of power spectrum and bispectrum still improves the constraint by a factor of 2 ( solid ) .",
    "this is because of another bias parameter @xmath27 , which coherently boosts the amplitude of bispectrum . also , one important assumption here is that the cosmological parameters are known a priori from the cmb observations , including the normalization of linear power spectrum . in other words ,",
    "if the specific cosmological models are not given , the linear bias information is not extracted from the power spectrum .    on the other hand , the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] shows the constraint on the nonlinear bias parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the power spectrum alone can not constrain @xmath27 , because the parameter @xmath27 does not appear in the expression of power spectrum , relevant at the large scales of our interest ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : power_spectrum ] ) . even using the bispectrum ,",
    "@xmath27 is poorly constrained .",
    "this is due to the degeneracy between the bias parameters @xmath14 and @xmath27 . in this respect ,",
    "the combination of the power spectrum and bispectrum is quite essential to break the degeneracy . with the help of the power spectrum information ,",
    "@xmath14 is measured precisely , and this will lead to a substantial improvement of the constraint on @xmath27 , as shown by the solid line .",
    "the bispectrum has been recognized as a powerful tool to probe non  gaussian initial conditions , and to enhance the constraints on bao distance measurements . in this paper",
    ", we highlighted the benefit to improve the simultaneous constraint on the growth of structure , and geometric distances through the rsd and a - p effect .",
    "the power spectrum in redshift space suffers from nonlinear cross talk between small- and large - scale clustering , and the clustering amplitude is significantly suppressed at large scales . while the impact of this fog effect is less significant at the scales close to the linear regime , it is difficult to break degeneracy between the distortions induced by coherent motions and systematics arising from the fog effect .",
    "although this would be certainly resolved with a better understanding of the nonlinear cross talk based on a more elaborate theoretical model , we proposed an alternative method to improve the cosmological constraints by using both the power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "assuming a desi - like experiment , fisher matrix analysis suggests that the analysis using the power spectrum data alone shows a strong parameter degeneracy between the growth of structure ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath20 as a nuisance parameter characterizing the damping scale of the fog effect . in hat case",
    "the estimated error on @xmath12 is about 5@xmath96 at the most sensitive redshift bin .",
    "we found that this parameter degeneracy can be broken when combining both the power spectrum and bispectrum . as a result",
    ", the constraint will be improved by a factor of two , which satisfies the primary science goal to distinguish the possibilities to explain the cosmic acceleration , i.e. , the dark energy and modification of gravity on cosmological scales .",
    "note finally that these results certainly depend on the model of the fog effect .",
    "this is especially the case for the bispectrum . while we adopted a simple gaussian ansatz to describe the fog damping , a proper way to characterize the fog effect in bispectrum",
    "is not yet fully understood .",
    "different assumption or prescription of the fog effect is possible , and may lead to a quantitatively different result .",
    "we leave this issue for further work .",
