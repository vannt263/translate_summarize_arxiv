    "it is a simple @xmath15-dimensional convex polytope whose vertices are given by the set  @xmath16 of centrally symmetric triangulations of a @xmath17-gon .",
    "various realizations have also been given in  @xcite , but none of them is similar to loday s realization .",
    "it is a natural question to ask for a construction similar to loday s for the cyclohedron and we present such a construction in this article : starting with a realization of the permutahedron  @xmath18 , i.e. the convex hull of the orbit of the point  @xmath19 with respect to the action of the hyperoctahedral group , we give an explicit description of realizations of the cyclohedron by removing facets of  @xmath18 .",
    "moreover we introduce an algorithm to obtain ( integer ) coordinates for the vertices of these realizations .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the associahedron and cyclohedron fit into another large family of polytopes , the _ graph associahedra _ introduced by m.  carr and s.  devadoss  @xcite and by m.  davis , t.  januszkiewicz , and r.  scott  @xcite in the study of real blow - ups of projective hyperplane arrangements .",

    "the associahedron and cyclohedron may be obtained in many ways by omission of some inequalities .",
    "we explicitly describe possible choices for these facet inequalities related oriented coxeter graphs of type  @xmath22 and  @xmath23 and the resulting coordinates . moreover , the presented realizations of the cyclohedron are the first explicit realizations as a `` generalized type  @xmath23 permutahedron '' , i.e. the cyclohedron is obtained from the permutahedron of type  @xmath23 by changing the right hand side of some inequalities .",
    "it turns out that loday s construction is generalized in two ways by our algorithm : firstly , for a certain orientation of the coxeter graph of type  @xmath22 our algorithm coincides with his construction and secondly , our algorithm also works for the type b associahedron , it yields coordinates for the cyclohedron for any oriented coxeter graph of type  @xmath23 .",
