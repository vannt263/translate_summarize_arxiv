    "the semi - leptonic decay @xmath3 with the vector - meson @xmath4 subsequently decaying as @xmath5 constitutes an ideal channel for the search for new physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",

    ", the extraction of information on high - scale new physics is hampered by the impact of non - perturbative qcd effects , entering mainly through hadronic @xmath1 form factors and resonant @xmath2 intermediate states .",
    "the sensitivity to form factors can be significantly reduced by considering appropriate observables and an optimised set of such observables has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the region of large hadronic recoil , i.e. for a small invariant mass @xmath6 of the muon pair .    in this region",
    "of large hadronic recoil , the recent lhcb angular analysis @xcite has indicated significant deviations from sm expectations , most notably in the observables @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite . the upcoming analysis with an increased amount of data",
    "will show if these deviations are physical effects or only statistical fluctuations . to this",
    "end relations among the observables can be used to check consistence of the experimental results @xcite .",
    "if the anomaly persists , it can be accomodated in np scenarios with an additional contribution to the wilson coefficient @xmath9 of about @xmath10 of its sm value , as pointed out originally in ref .",
    "this basic observation has been confirmed by independent studies using a different set of observables and/or statistical methods  @xcite .    in order to be able to draw solid conclusions on potential high - scale np effects from @xmath3 data ,",
    "it is important that uncertainties from non - perturbative qcd are under control and properly included in the theory predictions . in this proceeding",
    "we discuss the dominant uncertainties stemming from the hadronic @xmath1 form factors and from @xmath2 loops , summarising our results from ref .",
    "the evaluation of matrix elements for the decay @xmath3 involves seven non - perturbative form factors @xmath11 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for definitions ) .",
    "lcsr calculations of these form factors @xcite suffer from large uncertainties originating from hadronic parameters , and moreover rely on certain assumptions ( modelling the continuum contribution , suppression of excited states , etc . ) introducing systematic uncertainties that are difficult to quantify .",
    "furthermore , lcsr results are usually presented without specifying the correlations among the various form factors .    in the region of large",
    "recoil and at leading order in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , heavy - quark symmetries relate the seven form factors @xmath11 among each other , reducing the number of independent form factors to two  @xcite .",
    "different choices are possible for the selection of these two so - called soft form factors : @xmath14 here @xmath15 represents the linear combination @xmath16 of the form factors @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the energy of the @xmath4 meson , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 the masses of the @xmath22- and @xmath4-meson , respectively . by expressing the seven form factors in terms of two soft form factors , hadronic uncertainties from the lcsr input",
    "are significantly reduced because dominant correlations are automatically taken into account .",
    "higher orders in @xmath12 and @xmath13 break the large - recoil symmetry relations among form factors . while effects of order @xmath12 can be consistently included in the analysis using the framework of qcd factorisation ( qcdf ) @xcite , effects of order @xmath13",
    "can only be estimated .",
    "the choice of the two soft form factors defines a renormalisation scheme , and theory predictions made to a certain order in @xmath12 or @xmath13 will exhibit a scheme dependence at the level of the neglected higher orders .",
    "this scheme dependence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo ] at order @xmath23 but at leading order in @xmath13 for the observable @xmath24  @xcite and the optimised observable @xmath25  @xcite in two different schemes ( grey bands and blue(solid ) boxes ) .",
    "the optimsed observables are constructed in such a way that any dependence on form factors drops out at lo in @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the uncertainty associated to the form factor input as well as the scheme dependence are pushed to order @xmath23 for the observable @xmath7 in contrast to the observable @xmath24 .",
    "in addition we show the prediction which one would obtain using uncorrelated qcd form factors without resorting to large - recoil symmetries ( red ( dashed ) boxes ) .",
    "the result demonstrates that in absence of a precise knowledge of correlations it is indispensable to make use of the soft form factor decomposition .     and",
    "@xmath26 at lo in @xmath13 .",
    "uncertainties are solely due to form factors .",
    "grey bands correspond to the renormalisation scheme with lcsr input @xmath27 and blue ( solid ) boxes to the scheme with input @xmath28 .",

    "it is thus desirable to include them into the soft form factor decomposition .",
    "even though there does not exist a direct calculation of these corrections , they can be assessed indirectly as they are contained in the lcsr results for the full form factors .",
    "starting from a parametrisation @xmath30 of the full lcsr form factors @xmath31 , with @xmath32 representing the lo expression in the large - recoil limit and @xmath33 the qcdf corrections , information on factorisable power corrections encoded in the parameters @xmath34 can be obtained from a fit to the full @xmath35 .",
    "this strategy has been proposed and followed for the first time in ref .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite fit the parameters @xmath36 using central values for the form factors @xmath37 , and they interpret the result @xmath38 as an order of magnitude estimate for the power corrections . in this spirit",
    "the uncertainties associated to power corrections are estimated by varying independently @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in this approach , the central values of theory predictions",
    "are not affected by power corrections , in particular their scheme dependence is not reduced .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainties associated with the power corrections are determined from the central values of the form factors , even though from the conceptual point of view they are related to the uncertainties of the latter .",
    "in particular in the hypothetical case in which the form factors are precisely known , i.e. their uncertainties ( and the uncertainties of their power corrections ) go to zero , the obtained error estimate for the power corrections would remain constant and different from zero .",
    "finally , the method does not make use of the full information obtained from the fit as the definite and correlated signs of the fit parameters @xmath38 get lost . in the light of the definite sign of the fit results ,",
    "the symmetric variation of the @xmath34 around zero implies that power corrections are underestimated in one direction while they are overestimated in the other .    in our analysis",
    "we modify the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and go beyond it in several aspects .",
    "we keep the fit values @xmath41 as non - zero central values and vary @xmath42 in order to fix the ranges @xmath43 for the variation , we consider an expanded version @xmath44 of the full lcsr form factors and attribute to the power corrections an uncertainty of @xmath45 of the full form factor setting @xmath46 .",
    "this procedure has the following features : the non - zero central values of the power corrections shift the central values of observables to the values which one would obtain using directly the full form factors .",
    "this implies that our predictions for the central values are scheme - independent introduced by non - factorisable power corrections to the qcdf - amplitude , i.e. by power corrections that are not related to the description of the full form factors in terms of soft form factors . ] .",
    "the error variation is performed with respect to the shifted central values implying a shift of the error bands with respect to the error bands obtained in ref .",
    "our error estimate is conservative as it amounts to assigning an error of @xmath47 to the result from the fit , given the fact that the typical size of power corrections is @xmath48 . moreover , since the error ranges @xmath49 are introduced by hand , they can easily be adopted once information on the uncertainties of the lcsr form factors improves by smaller overall errors or better knowledge of correlations .",
    "power corrections are constrained , on the one hand from exact kinematic relations to be fulfilled by the full form factors at @xmath50 , and on the other hand by the choice of the renormalisation scheme for the soft form factors .",
    "these correlations , which have to be taken into account when the @xmath34 are varied within the ranges of eq .",
    "( [ eq : errvar ] ) , are thus scheme - dependent . taking for example @xmath28 as soft form factors eliminates power corrections ( and the corresponding uncertainties ) in the form factors @xmath51 and @xmath52 , while taking @xmath27 as input eliminates power corrections in @xmath53 and minimises their effects in @xmath54 . a change of the renormalisation scheme corresponds to the reshuffling of power corrections among the different form factors",
    ". an appropriate choice of the renormalisation scheme can therefore reduce the impact of power corrections on a certain observable by shifting the power corrections into those form factors to which the observable is less sensitive . in principle",
    "it is possible to choose for each observable the optimal scheme which minimises its individual error .",
    "note , however , that in a global analysis one is forced to use the same scheme for all observables if one does not want to loose correlations among the observables .    in fig .",
