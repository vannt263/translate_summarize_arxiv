    "_ 1 ^ -k_1^ k^ _ 2^+k_2^ [ lkl ] where @xmath294 and @xmath295 corresponds to the action of @xmath296 in the original time - space coordinates @xmath134 .",
    "the deviations @xmath297 in ( [ lkl ] ) can be adjusted by using lemma  [ lmpoi ] .",
    "the difference @xmath298 is estimated by @xmath299 by putting all these estimates together we get tight bounds on @xmath300 in ( [ main1 ] ) .",
    "similarly we get bounds on @xmath301 in ( [ main1 ] ) .",
    "the following is the final result of this analysis : v_l(t+t,)-v_l(t,)= d(t , ) t + _ 3 [ vv ] here ( t,)=a [ q_0v_l^2(t,)-2q_1v_l(t,)+q_2 ] [ cald ] and @xmath172 are defined similarly to ( [ q0])-([q2 ] ) , in which @xmath76 must be replaced by the actual piston position @xmath302 .",
    "the error term @xmath303 in ( [ vv ] ) is bounded by |_3| [ chibound ] which corresponds to brownian motion - type random fluctuations .",
    "the term @xmath304 in ( [ vv ] ) represents the main ( `` deterministic '' ) force acting on the piston .",
    "the term @xmath303 describes random fluctuations of that force . when the piston velocity stabilizes , then the main force @xmath305 should vanish , and an `` equilibrium '' velocity @xmath306 will be established . the latter is the root of the equation @xmath307 , which is    to @xmath308 is that @xmath305 is almost proportional to @xmath309 , i.e. @xmath310 for some constants @xmath311 .",
    "in fact , @xmath306 is a very slowly changing function of @xmath13 , whose derivative is small : @xmath312 . as a result",
    ", @xmath313 will always stay close to @xmath308 , more precisely |v_l(t,)-|v_l(t,)| < constl^-1l [ vbarv ] on the entire zero - recollision interval @xmath314 .",
    "now , the piston coordinate @xmath315 is the solution of the differential equation @xmath316 where @xmath317 by ( [ vbarv ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the deterministic piston coordinate @xmath76 is the solution of the equation @xmath318 , and both @xmath319 and @xmath114 are given by the same radical expression , cf .",
    "( [ wroot ] ) and ( [ vroot ] ) .",
    "lastly , a simple application of gronwall s inequality completes the proof of theorem  [ tmmain ] on the zero - recollision interval @xmath320 .",
    "the proof on the one - recollision interval @xmath321 goes along the same lines .",
    "one major difference is that the number of particles @xmath284 , @xmath286 , in the domain @xmath285 constructed in the velocity decomposition scheme is no longer a poisson variable , so lemma  [ lmpoi ] does not apply directly .    to handle this new situation",
    ", we pull the domain @xmath285 back in time , as we did before .",
    "but now that pullback involves one interaction with the piston ( corresponding to the first collision of the particles in @xmath285 with the piston , which occurs during the zero - recollision interval @xmath314 ) .",
    "since the piston position and velocity at the moment of that first collision are random , the preimage of @xmath285 will be a random domain .",
    "its shape will depend on the piston velocity @xmath322 during the zero - recollision interval @xmath314 .",
    "we observe that the boundary of the preimage of @xmath285 is described by a random , yet hlder continuous function , and its hlder exponent is @xmath323 due to ( [ chibound ] )",
    ". then we pick a small @xmath324 and construct a @xmath325-dense set in the space of all hlder continuous functions in the spirit of a work by kolmogorov and tihomirov @xcite .",
    "the elements of that @xmath325-dense set can be used to construct a finite collection of ( nonrandom ) domains , so that one of them will approximate the ( random ) preimage of our @xmath285 ( we need to select the small @xmath324 carefully to ensure sufficient accuracy of the approximation ) .",
    "now the number of particles in our random domain ( the preimage of @xmath285 ) can be approximated by the number of particles in the corresponding nonrandom domain .",
    "the latter has poisson distribution , and finally we can apply lemma  [ lmpoi ] .",
    "this trick gives necessary estimates on @xmath284 .",
    "a full proof of theorem  [ tmmain ] is given in @xcite . at present , we do not know if this theorem can be extended beyond the critical time @xmath238 , this is an open question .",
    "some other open problems are discussed in the next section .",
    "\\1 . the main goal of this work is to prove that under suitable initial conditions random fluctuations in the motion of a massive piston are small and vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we are , however , able to control those fluctuations effectively only as long as the surrounding gas particles can be described by a poisson process , i.e.  during the zero - recollision interval @xmath95 . in that case",
    "the random fluctuations are bounded by const@xmath326 , see remark  2 after theorem  [ tmmain ] . up to the logarithmic factor ,",
    "this bound is optimal , see @xcite and earlier estimates by holley @xcite , drr et al .",
    "@xcite .    during the one - recollision interval @xmath327",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "the probability distribution of gas particles that have experienced one collision with the piston is no longer a poisson process , it has intricate correlations .",
    "we are only able to show that random fluctuations remain bounded by @xmath328 , see again remark  2 .",
    "perhaps , our bound is far from optimal , but our numerical experiments reported in @xcite show that random fluctuations indeed grow during the one - recollision interval .",
    "we have tested numerically whether random fluctuations remained small after more than one recollision , i.e.  at times @xmath329 .",
    "we found that for some initial @xmath44 they actually increased very rapidly , and we conjectured that the rate of increase was exponential in @xmath41 .",
    "we found , indeed , that at times @xmath330 the fluctuations became large even on a macroscopic scale , and then many unexpected phenomena occurred @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the exponential growth of random fluctuations seems to be related to the instability of our hydrodynamical equations .",
    "we found that small perturbations of the initial density @xmath44 can grow exponentially in @xmath41 under certain conditions , matching the growth of random fluctuations of the piston motion in the mechanical model .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further discussion and to our work in progress @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in our model recollisions of gas particles with the piston have a very `` destructive '' effect on the dynamics in the system .",
    "however , we need to distinguish between two types of recollisions .",
    "we say that a recollision of a gas particle with the piston is _ long _ if the particle hits a wall @xmath24 or @xmath25 between the two consecutive collisions with the piston .",
    "otherwise a recollision is said to be _",
    "short_. long recollisions require some time , as the particle has to travel all the way to a wall , bounce off it , and then travel back to the piston before it hits it again .",
    "short recollisions can occur in rapid succession .",
    "we have imposed the velocity cut - off ( p4 ) in order to avoid any recollisions for at least some initial period of time ( which we call the zero - recollision interval ) .",
    "more precisely , the upper bound @xmath59 guarantees the absence of long recollisions . without it , we would have to deal with arbitrarily fast particles that dash between the piston and the wall very many times in any interval @xmath226 . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower bound @xmath60 was assumed to exclude short recollisions .",
    "there are good reasons to believe , though , that short recollisions may not be so destructive for the piston dynamics . indeed , let a particle experience two or more collisions with the piston in rapid succession ( i.e. without hitting a wall in between ) .",
    "this can occur in two cases : ( i ) the particle s velocity is very close to that of the piston , or ( ii ) the piston s velocity changes very rapidly",
    ". the latter should be very unlikely , since the deterministic acceleration of the piston is very small , cf.theorem  [ tmprop]c . in case ( i )",
    ", the recollisions should have very little effect on the velocity of the piston according to the rule ( [ v ] ) , so that they may be safely ignored , as it was done already in earlier studies @xcite .",
    "\\3 . in our paper",
    ", @xmath0 plays a dual role : it parameterizes the mass of the piston ( @xmath1 ) , and it represents the length of the container ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this duality comes from our assumption that the container is a cube .",
    "however , our model is essentially one - dimensional , and the mass of the piston @xmath9 and the length of the interval @xmath29 can be treated as two independent parameters . in particular , we can assume that the container is infinitely long in the @xmath7 direction ( so , _ that _ @xmath0 is infinite ) , but the mass of the piston is still finite and given by @xmath1 .",
    "in this case there are no recollisions with the piston , as long as its velocity remains small .",
    "hence , our zero - recollision interval is effectively infinite . as a result ,",
    "theorem  [ tmmain ] can be extended to arbitrarily large times .",
    "precisely , for any @xmath242 we can prove the convergence in probability : @xmath332 and @xmath333 as @xmath8 , where @xmath334 is a constant and @xmath76 and @xmath80 are the solutions of the hydrodynamical equations described in section  2 .    \\4 . along the same lines as above",
    ", we can assume that the container is @xmath325-dimensional with @xmath335 .",
    "then the mass of the piston and the density of the particles are proportional to @xmath336 rather than @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath325 is large , the gas particles are very dense on the @xmath275 plane .",
    "this leads to a much better control over fluctuations of the particle distribution and the piston trajectory . as a result ,",
    "theorem  [ tmmain ] can be extended to the @xmath300-recollision interval @xmath337 , where @xmath338 depends on @xmath325 .",
    "it can be shown that for any @xmath338 there is a @xmath339 such that for all @xmath340 the convergence ( [ yy ] ) and ( [ ww ] ) holds with @xmath341 .",
    "therefore , a higher dimensional piston is more stable than a lower dimensional one",
    ".    it would be interesting to investigate other modifications of our model that lead to more stable regimes .",
    "for example , let the initial density @xmath43 of the gas depend on the factor @xmath342 in such a way that @xmath343 , where @xmath344 is a fixed function .",
    "then the particle density grows as @xmath345 .",
    "this is another way to increase the density of the particles , but without changing the dimension .",
    "one may expect a better control over random fluctuations in this case , too .",
