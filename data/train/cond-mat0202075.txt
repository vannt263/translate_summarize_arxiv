    "topological constraints decrease the accessible degrees of freedom of a polymer chain @xcite . whether temporary or permanent , they are quite ubiquitous and effect the typical behaviour of polymers .",
    "for instance , temporary entanglements between chains in a solution or melt of polymers give rise to reptation dynamics as described by the tube model @xcite .",
    "permanent entanglements , in turn , are central for the elastic behaviour of rubber ( where they are chemically induced during vulcanisation ) @xcite , gels and olympic gels @xcite .",
    "their influence on the dynamics is reflected by broad relaxation time spectra @xcite .",
    "knots are a particular form of permanent topological entanglements : a `` knotted '' closed chain can not be reduced to a simple ring ( the so - called unknot ) without breaking bonds @xcite .",
    "one of the few exact results pertaining to the statistics of knots is that a sufficiently long closed self - avoiding walk contains knots with probability one @xcite .",
    "thus , topological constraints are inevitably created during the polymerisation of long closed chains and , more generally , knots and permanent entanglements are a ubiquitous feature of multi - chain polymer melts and solutions .",
    "topological considerations also play a major role in numerous biological and chemical systems .",
    "for example , the chromosomes forming almost two metres of tangled , knotted dna can not be separated during mitosis , and the genetic code of the dna double helix can not be fully accessed during transcription , in the presence of knots @xcite .",
    "special enzymes , namely dna topoisomerases , are necessary to actively remove knots and entanglements under consumption of energy from atp @xcite .",
    "the interplay between energy and entropy at a fixed topology is relevant to the secondary structure of rna which consists of paired segments interrupted by open loops acting as entropy source @xcite .",
    "similar issues arise in the helix - coil transition of dna @xcite .",
    "knotted configurations have even been found in some proteins @xcite .",
    "dynamically , the presence of knots and their possible effects on the mobility of biopolymers are essential to the understanding of their behaviour _ in vivo _ or , e.g. , as studied by electrophoresis _ in vitro _",
    "a similar role is played by topological effects for the translocation of viral and non - viral proteins @xcite , and packaging of dna @xcite . in supramolecular chemistry ,",
    "molecules with identical bond sequence but different topology can be produced which exhibit different physical properties , and mechanically linked molecules open up new vistas in information processing or nano - engineering @xcite .",
    "further interest in the theoretical study of the equilibrium behaviour of polymers with a fixed topology arises from new experimental techniques by which single molecules can be probed and manipulated @xcite , providing information on the mechanical behaviours of knotted and unknotted biopolymers @xcite .",
    "mathematical studies of topological structures date back to kepler @xcite , euler @xcite and listing @xcite .",
    "motivated by thomson s theory of vertex atoms @xcite , systematic studies of knots were undertaken by tait , kirkwood and little @xcite .",
    "knot theory provides a number of so - called knot invariants by means of which knots can be classified , such as the gauss winding number , the number of essential crossings , or more refined invariants like knot polynomials @xcite .",
    "all permitted configurational changes of a knot can be decomposed into the three reidemeister moves @xcite .",
    "there exists a fundamental relation between knots and gauge theory as knot projections and feynman graphs share the same basic ingredients corresponding to a hopf algebra @xcite .",
    "recently there has been increasing interest in the interplay of topological constraints and thermal fluctuations ; the latter being ubiquitous for dilute or semidilute polymer solutions or melts at finite temperatures .",
    "statistical mechanical treatments of permanent entanglements and of knots are , however , quite difficult since topological restrictions can not be formulated as a hamiltonian problem but appear as hard constraints partitioning the phase space @xcite .",
    "consequently , only a relatively small range of problems have been treated analytically ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    to overcome such difficulties in the context of the entropic elasticity for rubber networks , ball , doi , edwards and coworkers replaced permanent entanglements by slip - links @xcite .",
    "slip - links enforce contacts between pairs of monomers but the chain can slide freely through them .",
    "surrogate networks containing slip - links have been successful in the prediction of important physical quantities of rubber networks @xcite . in a similar fashion , we investigate the statistical behaviour of single polymer chains in which a fixed topology is created by a number of slip - links .",
    "`` paraknots '' _ can be studied analytically using known results for gaussian random walks in the ideal chain limit @xcite . in the language of graphs ,",
    "slip - link contacts represent vertices with four outgoing legs , enabling us to make use of a scaling approach to determine the leading behaviour in the presence of self - avoiding interactions .",
    "the paraknot approach thus complements our previous study of _ flat _ knots in which such vertices correspond to crossings @xcite .    in the following section ,",
    "we start with a brief summary of conflicting answers to the question of whether the topological details in a knotted polymer are localised within a small portion of the chain , and thus segregated from an unentangled segment .",
    "we then introduce the concept of paraknots to study localisation effects for polymers with fixed topology .",
    "paraknots are first analysed for ideal chains in section [ section_iiia ] ; various contributions to the joint probability density function ( pdf ) of segment sizes are easily separated in this case .",
    "there is no similar factorisation of the pdf for self - avoiding segments , but as discussed in section [ section_iiib ] , scaling arguments can be used to infer the limiting behaviour of the pdf as one or more segments contract to small size .",
    "the question of the relative sizes of segments in a paraknot is taken up in section [ tight ] . by analysing the behaviour of the unconditional pdf of a particular segment at small sizes we can infer whether the segment has the tendency to be tight .",
    "yet , to describe the actual probability of finding a tight segment , one must consider the competition between all segments .",
    "for example , even in cases where all segments prefer to be tight _ per se _ , a given segment can still have a finite probability of being loose .",
    "( 8,6.2 ) ( -2.2,-20 )    in fig .",
    "[ fig0]a we depict the projection of a trefoil knot in a symmetric ( bottom ) and an asymmetric configuration ( top ) . in the latter case",
    ", we can introduce a knot region as that part of the knot which contains all topological details except for the one larger simply connected segment , as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "initial indications of tight knotted regions are implicit in 3d monte carlo simulations of janse van rensburg and whittington @xcite , who studied the mean extension of the unknot and several knot types up to six essential crossings .",
    "they found that in the scaling form @xmath0 of the gyration radius both the prefactor @xmath1 and the exponent @xmath2 in the leading contribution are _ independent _ of the knot type @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath2 was found to be consistent with the known value @xmath3 of the swelling exponent of a ring polymer @xcite .",
    "( the confluent correction term was estimated to decay with @xmath4 . )",
    "conversely , employing a flory - type argument under the assumption that the knot is equally _ spread out _ over the polymer , quake predicted that the gyration radius should contain the scaling dependence @xmath5 on the number of essential crossings @xmath6 in the leading order term , i.e. , that the amplitude of @xmath7 decreases with increasing knot complexity @xcite .",
    "this result was supported by his numerical study of knots up to @xmath8 @xcite , with a different algorithm than used in ref .",
    "_ @xcite also make use of a flory - type approach assuming that in an evenly delocalised knot the topological constraints can be replaced by a tube whose radius can be determined from the aspect ratio of a maximally inflated state .",
    "they obtained similar conclusions to quake , although they also remark mhat thermodynamically a segregation into a simply connected ring polymer and a dense knot region might occur @xcite . in a later work ,",
    "grosberg states that a more powerful approach is needed to theoretically decide between the two options @xcite .",
    "more recent numerical studies seem to corroborate the independence of the gyration radius of the knot type in long enough polymers .",
    "thus , in 3d    ( 8,7.68 ) ( -7,-18.4 )    orlandini _ et al . _",
    "calculate in a monte carlo study the number of configurations @xmath9 of different knot types @xmath10 , reporting that @xmath11 where both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are independent of @xmath10 for prime knots , and that an additional factor @xmath14 occurs for composite knots with @xmath15 prime components @xcite .",
    "these authors conclude that one or more tight knot regions can move along the perimeter of a simply connected ring polymer , each prime component being represented by one knot region @xcite .",
    "an analogous result was obtained in 2d by guitter and orlandini @xcite .",
    "consistent with these findings , katritch _",
    "obtained that the knot region is tight in 3d with a relatively high probability @xcite .",
    "the investigations of shimamura and deguchi @xcite corroborate this picture in obtaining that the gyration radius is independent of the knot type in some limit of their model .",
    "why should knots be confined to a small region of the polymer ?",
    "entropic effects give rise to long - range interactions as we demonstrate for the figure - eight structure sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig0]b in which a permanent pair contact is enforced by a slip - link , creating two loops of lengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which can freely exchange length . in the ideal chain limit , the two loops correspond to returning random walks , i.e. , the pdf @xmath18 for the size @xmath16 becomes @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the embedding dimension .",
    "the average loop size @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a short - distance cutoff set by the lattice constant , is trivially @xmath23 , due to the symmetry of the structure .",
    "however , as the pdf is strongly peaked at @xmath24 and @xmath25 , a _",
    "typical _ shape consists of one small ( _ tight _ ) and one large ( _ loose _ ) loop .",
    "for instance , in @xmath26 the mean size of the smaller loop @xmath27 scales as @xmath28 which corresponds to _ weak localisation _ in the sense that the smaller loop still grows with @xmath29 , but with an exponent smaller than one . by comparison , for @xmath30 one",
    "encounters @xmath31 , corresponding to _",
    "strong localisation _ as the size of the smaller loop does not depend on @xmath29 but is set by the short - distance cutoff @xmath22 . on the other hand , for @xmath32 one finds @xmath33 , such that the smaller loop is still rather large .",
    "however , we will see in the next section that this is no longer true if we include self - avoiding interactions for the chains ; in that case , the localisation for @xmath32 is even stronger than for @xmath26 .    equation ( [ fig8d3 ] ) shows that the smaller loop , of length @xmath16 , of the figure - eight structure is indeed tight in @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , for _ flat _ knots rendered as quasi 2d knot projections , it turns out that _ all _ prime knots become tight , and that their leading scaling behaviour corresponds to the figure - eight structure @xcite .",
    "this localisation is the consequence of a delicate interplay between competing effects .",
    "statistically , the confinement of topological details into a localised region of the polymer chain is favoured entropically as then the topological constraints act on a small portion of the chain , exclusively , and the remaining major part has access to all degrees of freedom of a simply connected ring polymer .",
    "this tendency towards confinement is counteracted by the internal degrees of freedom of the knot region in which the substructures can exchange length among each other .",
    "it turns out that the tradeoff is in favour of localisation .",
    "we propose that slip - link structures grasp some essential features of the statistical behaviour of real knots and therefore call them _ paraknots . _ some elementary examples of paraknot structures which will be discussed in the following sections are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] .",
    "the slip - links in these configurations can be viewed as little rings which enforce pair contacts within the chain such that the loop formed by the slip - link is not allowed to fully retract . in a simulation , this latter property",

    "[ fig1a]d . in a paraknot , one or several loops may be cut , creating open chain segments as in figures [ fig1a]e to g. such `` open '' paraknot types can be stabilised ( i.e. , an open end prevented from escaping through a slip - link ) by attaching `` stoppers '' to the open ends , such as latex microspheres , ring - molecules , or c@xmath34 balls , as known from supramolecular chemistry @xcite .",
    "paraknots are tractable exactly in the ideal chain limit , and by scaling theories in the self - avoiding domain . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the statistical description and the localisation properties of several paraknot structures .",
    "a general paraknot can be constructed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , from an arc diagram similar to those used to classify the secondary structure of rna @xcite .",
    "such an arc diagram is the blueprint of the associated paraknot , and it features the original loop into which slip - links are introduced by connecting pairs of monomers through the dashed lines . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we only consider paraknots with unconcatenated loops , i.e. , the arcs are not allowed to intersect each other . in the rna language",
    ", this means that pseudoknots are not permitted @xcite . with this restriction ,",
    "the joint pdf for the sizes of various segments simplifies to a product of contributions from loops , in the case of ideal ( gaussian ) polymers . as discussed next , in the case of self - avoiding walks , only scaling information is available in the limit when segments contract to small sizes .",

    "[ fig1 ] for fixed loop lengths @xmath35 .",
    "the key observation is that for ideal chains the degrees of freedom associated with the individual loops are decoupled from one another , so that the pdf of the paraknot factorises into the corresponding loop contributions . following the above example",

    "( ii ) sliding entropy : * a given loop ( or linear segment ) of length @xmath16 has additional degrees of freedom associated with the slip - links which slide on it .",
    "this is due to the relative motion of these slip - links along the segment .",

    "( such effects will be relegated to a future work @xcite . )",
    "if self - avoiding constraints for the chains are included , the above reasoning for ideal chains , in particular the factorisation of the pdf , is no longer valid in general since now every loop or segment of the paraknot interacts with all the others .",

    "if self - avoiding effects are considered , simple paraknots are strongly localised even in 2d and 3d .",
    "the scaling exponents involved can be obtained from duplantier s theory for general polymer networks . for the figure - eight paraknot ,",
    "we have confirmed the scaling exponent through monte carlo simulations .",
    "localisation in self - avoiding paraknots becomes weakened if more than one substructure has additional degrees of freedom , in analogy to the ideal chain case .",
    "this observation pertains to arbitrary topological polymer networks .",
    "the tightness of paraknots in 2d quantifies the strong localisation for flat knots observed by guitter and orlandini @xcite .",
    "whereas we can not infer definitive statements on 3d knots from our analysis , the correspondence between figure - eight paraknot and the leading order behaviour of prime knots ( and between the round table configuration and composite knots ) in 2d suggests that similar tightness could be observed in 3d as well .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of janse van rensburg and whittington @xcite , orlandini _",
    "_ @xcite and katritch _",
    "@xcite , and it differs from the conclusions of quake @xcite .",
    "additional energetic effects due to bending and the presence of ( screened ) electric charges are relevant for many systems , especially in biology . in",
    "so far as these effects can be accommodated by the introduction of a persistence length , they should not affect our results in the long - chain limit .",
    "however , they determine the crossover size for the onset of the long - chain limit in the polymer . for the particular case of the 2d trefoil knot",
    "the results of our previous analysis suggest that the continuum limit is reached for chains with 512 monomers , whereas for the figure - eight paraknot even chain lengths of 128 seem to be sufficient .",
    "thus , in a dna double helix for which the persistence length is of the order of 100 base pairs ( bp ) , one may expect to see localisation behaviours in _ simple _ topologically entangled states for strand lengths of the order of 10 to 50kbp , corresponding to a length of 5 to 25@xmath12 m @xcite . for shorter dna strands , it is to be expected that finite size effects prevail , and thus the knots or other topological details will be spread out over a considerably larger part of the entire chain .",
