    "the gravitational redshift , considered as one of the `` classical tests '' of general relativity ( gr ) , is actually a test of one facet of the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) .",
    "the weak version of the equivalence principle has been verified with high precision using torsion balances @xcite and lunar laser ranging @xcite .",
    "the gravitational redshift was predicted by einstein but not observed for a long time .",
    "it became observable with the advent of high precision quantum spectroscopy and was first measured in 1960 by pound and rebka @xcite , who used gamma ray spectroscopy of the radiation emitted and absorbed by @xmath0fe nuclei .",
    "the emitter and absorber were placed at the top and bottom of a @xmath1 high tower at harvard and the frequency difference predicted by gr was measured with about @xmath2 uncertainty .    in a test of the gravitational redshift using clocks , one checks that the clock rates are universal  i.e. the relative rates depend only on the difference of gravitational potentials ( as determined by the trajectories of massive test bodies ) but not on the nature and internal structure of the clocks . in 1976",
    "a hydrogen - maser clock was launched on a rocket to an altitude of @xmath3 and its frequency compared to a similar clock on ground .",
    "this yielded a test of the gravitational redshift with about @xmath4 accuracy @xcite .",
    "the european space agency will fly in 2013 the atomic clock ensemble in space ( aces ) @xcite , including a highly stable laser - cooled atomic clock , which will test ( in addition to many other applications in fundamental physics and metrology ) the gravitational redshift to a precision of about @xmath5 .",
    "the gravitational redshift is also tested in null redshift experiments in which the rates of different clocks ( based on different physical processes or different atoms ) are compared to each other @xcite .    quite generally in a modern context , tests of gr measure the difference between the predictions of gr and of some generalized alternative theory or theoretical framework ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that the classification and inter - comparison of different tests have then to be defined with respect to the framework used .",
    "atom interferometers have reached high sensitivities in the measurement of the gravitational acceleration @xcite .",
    "this yields very important tests of the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) or universality of free fall ( uff ) when comparing the free fall of atoms with that of classical macroscopic matter ( in practice a nearby freely falling corner cube whose trajectory is monitored by lasers ) .",
    "the relative precision of such tests of the uff is currently @xmath6 , using cs @xcite or rb @xcite atoms .",
    "although it remains less sensitive than tests using macroscopic bodies of different composition @xcite which have reached a precision of @xmath7 , this uff test is interesting as it is the most sensitive one comparing the free fall of quantum objects ( namely csium atoms ) with that of a classical test mass ( the corner cube ) . in this contribution , which summarizes the extensive paper @xcite , we investigate whether such experiments can also be interpreted as tests of the gravitational redshift .",
    "in a recent paper , mller , peters and chu @xcite ( hereafter abbreviated as mpc ) proposed a new interpretation of atom interferometry experiments as testing the gravitational redshift , that is also the universality of clock rates ( ucr ) , with a precision @xmath6 , which is several orders of magnitude better than the best present @xcite and near future @xcite clock tests .",
    "the main argument of mpc ( see also the more detailed papers @xcite ) is based on an analogy between atom interferometry experiments and classical clock experiments .",
    "the idea of clock experiments is to synchronize a pair of clocks when they are located closely to one another , and move them to different elevations in a gravitational field .",
    "the gravitational redshift will decrease the oscillation frequency of the lower clock relative to the higher one , yielding a measurable phase shift between them .",
    "there are two methods for measuring the effect .",
    "either we bring the clocks back together and compare the number of elapsed oscillations , or we measure the redshift by means of continuous exchanges of electromagnetic signals between the two clocks . in both methods",
    "one has to monitor carefully the trajectories of the two clocks .",
    "for example , in the second method one has to remove the doppler shifts necessarily appearing in the exchanges of electromagnetic signals .    in the first method",
    ", the phase difference between the two clocks when they are recombined together , can be written as a difference of integrals over proper time , @xmath8 \\equiv \\omega \\oint \\textrm{d}\\tau\\,.\\ ] ] the two clocks have identical proper frequency @xmath9 .",
    "we denote by i and ii the two paths ( with say i being at a higher altitude , i.e. a lower gravitational potential ) and use the notation @xmath10 to mean the difference of proper times between the two paths , assumed to form a close contour .",
    "the integrals in are evaluated along the paths of the clocks , and we may use the schwarzschild metric to obtain an explicit expression of the measured phase shift in the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "the phase shift measured by an atom interferometer contains a contribution which is similar to the clock phase shift , so it is tempting to draw an analogy with clock experiments . in this analogy ,",
    "the role of the clock s proper frequency is played by the atom s ( de broglie-)compton frequency @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the rest mass of the atom .",
    "however the phase shift includes also another contribution @xmath13 coming from the interaction of the laser light used in the beam - splitting process with the atoms .",
    "thus , @xmath14 here we are assuming that the two paths close up at the entry and exit of the interferometer ; otherwise , additional terms have to be added to .",
    "the schematic view of the atom interferometer showing the two interferometer paths i and ii is given by fig .",
    "the first term in is proportional to the atom s mass through the compton frequency and represents the difference of compton phases along the two classical paths .",
    "in contrast , the second term @xmath13 does not depend on the mass of the atoms .    ,",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 , separated by time intervals @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( we have @xmath19 when gravity gradients are neglected ) .",
    "the two - photon raman transitions are between two hyperfine levels @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the ground state of an alkali atom.,width=340 ]    at first sight , the first term in could be used for a test of the gravitational redshift , in analogy with classical clock experiments , and the precision of the test could be very good , because the compton frequency of the csium atom is very high , @xmath22 . however , as shown in a previous brief comment @xcite and the detailed paper @xcite , this re - interpretion of the atom interferometer as testing the ucr is fundamentally incorrect .    at this point , we want to mention other crucial differences between atom interferometry and clock experiments , which reinforce our conclusions . in clock experiments",
    "the trajectories of the clocks are continuously controlled for instance by continuous exchange of electromagnetic signals . in atom interferometry in contrast , the trajectories of the atoms are not measured independently but theoretically derived from the lagrangian and initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , we expect that it is impossible to determine independently the trajectories of the wave packets without destroying the interference pattern at the exit of the interferometer .",
    "another important difference lies in the very notion of a clock .",
    "atomic clocks use the extremely stable energy difference between two internal states . by varying the frequency of an interrogation signal ( e.g. microwave or optical ) , one obtains a resonant signal when the frequency is tuned to the frequency of the atomic transition . in their re - interpretation ,",
    "mpc view the entire atom as a clock ticking at the compton frequency associated with its rest mass .",
    "but the `` atom - clock '' is not a real clock in the previous sense , since it does not deliver a physical signal at compton frequency , as also recently emphasized in the same context in @xcite .",
    "note also that the phase shift for clocks is valid in any gravitational field , with any gravity gradients , since it is simply the proper time elapsed along the trajectories of the clocks in a gravitational field .",
    "by contrast , the phase shift is known only for quadratic lagrangians @xcite and can not be applied in a gravitational field with large gravity gradients , or more generally with any lagrangian that is of higher order .      the clear - cut argument showing that the atom interferometer does not measure",
    "the redshift is that the `` atom - clock '' contribution , i.e. the first term in , is in fact _",
    "zero _ for a closed total path @xcite . as a specific example , let us consider the prediction from gr , which has been extensively treated in @xcite ; here we only present a very basic analysis sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the appropriate lagrangian is given by the proper time @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 , and is derived to sufficient accuracy using the schwarzschild metric generated by the earth , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the earth s radius , @xmath27 is the newtonian gravitational acceleration , @xmath28 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath29 is the mass of the earth , @xmath12 the mass of the atom , @xmath30 the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 with @xmath33 the radial coordinate , and we neglect the post - newtonian corrections . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to only radial motion , which is sufficient for the arguments in this paper .",
    "the equations of motion are deduced from using the principle of least action or the euler - lagrange equations , and read evidently @xmath34 .",
    "then , when integrating along the resulting paths , and calculating the difference of action integrals @xmath35 as defined by the first term in , one finds @xmath36 the key point about the result is a consistent calculation of the two paths in the atom interferometer and of the phases along these paths , both derived from the same classical action , using in a standard way the principle of least action . at the deepest level ,",
    "the principle of least action and its use in atom interferometry comes from the feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics or equivalently the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "thus only the second term @xmath13 remains in .",
    "the final phase shift , @xmath37 depends on the wavevector @xmath38 of the lasers , on the interrogation time @xmath17 and on the local gravity @xmath20 .",
    "this shows that the atom interferometer is a gravimeter or accelerometer .",
    "the phase shift arises entirely from the interactions with the lasers and the fact that the atoms are falling with respect to the laboratory in which the experiment is performed .",
    "the atom s compton frequency is irrelevant .",
    "this framework , which we call the `` modified lagrangian formalism '' , is an adaptation for our purpose of a powerful formalism for analyzing tests of the eep and its various facets : the wep , the local lorentz invariance ( lli ) and the local position invariance ( lpi ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism allows deviations from general relativity and metric theories of gravity , with violations of the uff and ucr , and permits a coherent analysis of atom interferometry experiments .",
    "the formalism is defined by a single lagrangian , that is however different from the gr lagrangian . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to use a strongly simplified `` toy '' lagrangian chosen as a particular case within the `` energy conservation formalism '' of nordtvedt and haugan @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) . to keep in line with mpc we choose an expression similar to the lagrangian of gr given by , namely @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes a dimensionless parameter characterizing the violation of lpi , and depending on the particular type @xmath41 of mass - energy or interaction under consideration ; e.g. @xmath40 would be different for the electromagnetic or the nuclear interactions , with possible variations as a function of spin or the other internal properties of the atom , here labelled by the superscript @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath40 would depend not only on the type of internal energy @xmath41 but also on the type of atom @xmath42 .",
    "the lagrangian describes the newtonian limit of a large class of non - metric theories , in a way consistent with schiff s conjecture and fundamental principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "most alternative theories commonly considered belong to this class which encompasses a large number of models and frameworks ( see @xcite and references therein ) , like most non - metric theories ( e.g. the belinfante - swihart theory @xcite ) , some models motivated by string theory @xcite , some general parameterized frameworks like the energy conservation formalism @xcite , the @xmath43 formalism @xcite , and the lorentz violating standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite .    within this general formalism",
    "there is no fundamental distinction between uff and ucr tests , as violation of one implies violation of the other , thus testing one implies testing the other . depending on the theory used ,",
    "different experiments test different parameters or parameter combinations at differing accuracies , so they may be complementary or redundant depending on the context . by varying we obtain the equations of motion of the atom as @xmath44 which shows that the trajectory of the atom is affected by the violation of lpi and",
    "is not universal .",
    "in fact we see that @xmath40 measures the non - universality of the ratio between the atom s passive gravitational mass and inertial mass .",
    "thus , in the modified lagrangian framework the violation of lpi implies a violation of wep and the uff , and @xmath40 appears to be the uff - violating parameter .",
    "this is a classic example @xcite of the validity of schiff s conjecture , namely that it is impossible in any consistent theory of gravity to violate lpi ( or lli ) without also violating wep .",
    "the violation of lpi is best reflected in classical redshift experiments with clocks which can be analysed using a cyclic gedanken experiment based on energy conservation @xcite .",
    "the result for the frequency shift in a pound - rebka type experiment is @xmath45 where the redshift violating ( or ucr violating ) parameter @xmath46 is again non - universal .",
    "the important point , proven in @xcite , is that the ucr - violating parameter @xmath46 is related in a precise way to the uff - violating parameter @xmath40 , namely @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the internal energy responsible for the violation of lpi , and @xmath49 is the sum of the rest masses of the particles constituting the atom .",
    "therefore we can compare the different qualitative meaning of tests of ucr and uff .",
    "for a given set of uff and ucr tests their relative merit is given by and is dependent on the model used , i.e. the type of anomalous energy @xmath48 and its dependence on the used materials or atoms .",
    "we now consider the application to atom interferometry . in the experiment of @xcite the `` atom - clock '' that accumulates a phase is of identical composition to the falling object ( the same atom ) ,",
    "hence one has to consistently use the same value of @xmath40 when calculating the trajectories and the phase difference using the lagrangian .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath50 with the above lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath51 in this case is a general property of all quadratic lagrangians and comes from consistently using the same lagrangian for the calculation of the trajectories and the phase shift .",
    "it is related to the cancellation between the kinetic term and the gravitational potential energy term in the lagrangian .",
    "then the total phase shift of the atom interferometer is again given by the light interactions only , which are obtained from the phases at the interaction points evaluated using the trajectory given by .",
    "one then obtains @xmath52 we first note that in this class of theories the compton frequency plays no role , as @xmath53 .",
    "second , we note that although @xmath40 appears in the final phase shift , this is entirely related to the light phase shift coming from the trajectory of the atoms , and thus is a measurement of the effective free fall acceleration @xmath54 of the atoms , which is given by . in @xcite the resulting phase shift",
    "is compared to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the measured free fall acceleration of a falling macroscopic corner cube , i.e. @xmath57g$ ] , also deduced from . in this class of theories",
    "the experiment is thus a test of the uff , as it measures the differential gravitational acceleration of two test masses ( csium atom and corner cube ) of different internal composition , with precision @xmath58 note that this expression is equivalent to the one obtained by mpc in their recent paper @xcite ( p.  4 ) , but different from the one obtained in the same paper ( p.  3 ) for ucr tests .",

    "4 ) , where the subscripts refer to test masses 1 and 2 ( e.g. @xmath59 cs and @xmath60 falling corner cube in @xcite whilst @xmath59 ti and @xmath60 be in @xcite ) , and @xmath61 refers to the nuclear binding energy of the test masses . on the other hand ucr tests in @xcite set limits on either @xmath62 or @xmath63 ( @xcite , p.",
    "3 ) , where @xmath64 is related to the atomic transition of the atom used in the clock and not to its nuclear binding energy . ]      in the second framework , which we call the `` multiple lagrangian formalism '' , the _ motion _ of test particles ( atoms or macroscopic bodies ) obeys the standard gr lagrangian in a gravitational field , whereas the _ phase _ of the corresponding matter waves obeys a _ different _ lagrangian .",
    "the mpc analysis in @xcite belongs to this framework , for the trajectories and @xmath65 for the phases , which again corresponds to two different lagrangians . ] which raises extremely difficult problems .",
    "the wep is assumed to be valid for the motion of massive classical particles which thus obeys the standard lagrangian of general relativity , @xmath66 , i.e. to first order @xmath67 on the other hand the action integral to be used for the computation of the phase shift of the quantum matter wave is assumed to be calculated from the different lagrangian @xmath68 where the parameter @xmath69 that measures the deviation from gr ( i.e. @xmath70 in gr ) enters as a correction in the atom s gravitational potential energy . integrating the lagrangian along the paths given by",
    "the lagrangian shows that @xmath71 , where @xmath69 takes the meaning of a redshift - violation parameter .",
    "in particular we notice that @xmath69 could be `` universal '' , in contrast with the parameter @xmath40 in which depends on the type of atom @xmath42 and on some internal energy @xmath41 violating lpi . in the multiple lagrangian formalism , because wep is valid we can always test the value of @xmath69 by comparing @xmath20 as obtained from the free - fall of test bodies , to the phase difference cumulated by matter waves ( as proposed by mpc @xcite ) .",
    "the most important problem of this formalism is that it is inconsistent to use a different lagrangian ( or metric ) for the calculation of the trajectories and for the phases of the atoms or clocks .",
    "more precisely , it supposes that the fundamental feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , which is at the basis of the derivation of the phase shift in an atom interferometer @xcite , has to be altered in the presence of a gravitational field or could be wrong .",
    "physically it amounts to making the distinction between the atoms when calculating their trajectories and the same atoms when calculating their phases , which is inconsistent as it is the same fundamental matter field in both cases .",
    "even more , the basis for the derivation of the atom interferometry phase shifts is unjustified because the feynman formalism is violated . to remain coherent some alternative formalism for the atomic phase shift calculations ( presumably modifying quantum mechanics ) should be developed and used .",
    "more generally the multiple lagrangian formalism supposes that the duality between particles and waves in quantum mechanics gets somehow violated in a gravitational field .",
    "the above violation of the `` particle - wave duality '' , implied by the multiple lagrangian formalism , is very different from a violation of the equivalence principle in the ordinary sense . in this formalism",
    "a single physical object , the atom , is assumed to be described by two different lagrangians , @xmath72 applying to its phase shift , and @xmath73 applying to its trajectory .",
    "by contrast , in tests of the equivalence principle , one looks for the modification of the free fall trajectories or clock rates as a function of composition or clock type .",
    "thus , different bodies or clocks are described by different lagrangians , but of course for any single type of body we always have @xmath74 .",
    "the pertinent test - bed for equivalence principle violations is the modified lagrangian formalism reviewed in section [ modified ] , which does not imply any particle - wave duality violation .",
    "the second problem of theories in the multiple lagrangian formalism and of the interpretation of mpc is the violation of schiff s conjecture @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have assumed in this section that the lpi aspect of the equivalence principle is violated but that for instance the wep aspect remains satisfied . in a complete and self - consistent theory of gravitation one",
    "expects that the three aspects of the einstein equivalence principle ( wep , lli and lpi ) are sufficiently entangled together by the mathematical formalism of the theory that it is impossible to violate one without violating all of them .",
    "the schiff conjecture has been proved using general arguments based upon the assumption of energy conservation @xcite ; it is satisfied , for instance , in the @xmath43 formalism @xcite . a contrario",
    ", we expect that violating the conjecture leads to some breakdown of energy conservation . in the present case",
    "this translates into postulating two lagrangians and for the same physical object .",
    "explicit theories that are logically and mathematically consistent but still violate schiff s conjecture are very uncommon ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we conclude that the general statement of mpc according to which the atom interferometer measures or tests the gravitational redshift at the compton frequency is incorrect .",
    "instead , the interpretation of the experiment needs to be considered in the light of alternative theories or frameworks . although one can consider particular alternative frameworks in which the statement of mpc could make sense , such frameworks raise unacceptable conceptual problems which are not at the moment treated in a satisfactory manner .",
    "in particular , they break the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics which are used for calculating matter wave phases . in most common and plausible theoretical frameworks",
    "the atom interferometry experiment tests the universality of free fall with the compton frequency being irrelevant ."
