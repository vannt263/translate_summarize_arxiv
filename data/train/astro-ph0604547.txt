    "in this era of precision cosmology @xcite , it is vital that care is taken with every step involved in the analysis and interpretation of cosmological data . in this paper",
    "we consider the likelihood technique used to fit cosmological models to cmb power spectra . for their analysis of the 3-year data @xcite , the wmap team have adopted a pixel - based likelihood analysis at low multipoles , thus avoiding the complications introduced by fitting to the shape of the posterior surface @xcite .",
    "this posterior surface is strongly non - gaussian which must be accounted for when performing model comparisons using power spectra .",
    "in addition , there are now important constraints on both the temperature and polarisation power spectra , which are not independent and need to be jointly analysed .",
    "in this paper we review previous work analysing the posterior surface for temperature power spectra and extend this to include polarisation data .",
    "initially , we present exact formulae for all - sky surveys with negligible noise .",
    "the inclusion of isotropic uncorrelated gaussian distributed pixel noise will not change the form of the posterior surface for the @xmath0s as it will simply increase the variance in the @xmath1s  to calculate the @xmath0s we are still summing the squares of gaussian random variables .",
    "however , an incomplete sky map will change the posterior distribution , causing correlations between modes , and will also change the posterior shape . for any survey ,",
    "the central limit theorem can be invoked to show that at large @xmath2 , the likelihood distribution will tend to a multi - variate gaussian form .",
    "we therefore see that the true likelihood will interpolate between a skewed distribution on large scales , and a multi - variate gaussian distribution on small scales .",
    "fitting formulae which are able to match this intrinsic change in shape have previously been adopted to provide an approximate likelihood calculation for a single auto - power spectrum .",
    "the primary aim of our paper is to extend these fits to the combination of temperature and polarisation data .",
    "the layout of our paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : like ] we lay the groundwork by briefly reviewing the standard bayesian approach to model selection , using bayes theorem to link the likelihood to the posterior of interest . in section  [ sec : all - sky - temp ] we review the well known likelihood and posterior distributions for the tt power spectrum of an all - sky noiseless survey .",
    "this work is expanded in section  [ sec : wishart ] to include polarisation data in the same limit of no noise and an all - sky survey  the combined likelihood is given by the wishart distribution .",
    "the important properties , including the multi - variate gaussian limit at large @xmath2 are presented . in section  [ sec : complications ] we discuss the complications introduced by realistic surveys on the posterior shape .",
    "these complications have led previous studies to consider posterior fits for the tt power spectrum , the most common of which is the log - normal distribution @xcite . a number of these fits to the posterior surface",
    "are compared in section  [ sec : posterior_fit_single ] .",
    "the extension of these fits to the joint analysis of temperature and polarisation data is considered in section  [ sec : posterior_fit_multi ] .",
    "the importance of this work setting the mathematical foundation for the shape of the posterior surface is demonstrated in section  [ sec : marginalise ] , where we consider marginalising over a gaussian distributed calibration error in the tt power spectrum .",
    "the difference between assuming a gaussian posterior , commonly used in the literature , and using the correct distribution for an all - sky survey is demonstrated .",
    "we discuss our results in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "although it is probably the most reprinted equation in scientific literature , it is central to the work presented here , so for completeness we include the standard bayesian equation f(*x*| * * ) = , [ eq : bayes ] which relates the likelihood function @xmath3  the distribution of the data @xmath4 given a model @xmath5 , to the posterior @xmath6  the distribution of models given the data .",
    "the prior @xmath7 , which can not be avoided , provides the information that we already know about the models .",
    "for example , our prior might be that only 6-parameters are needed to model present cmb data , and that we initially know nothing about those parameters ",
    "they themselves have uniform priors .",
    "it is probably worth emphasising that the distributions of the likelihood and posterior can have different forms .",
    "for example , if the likelihood is gaussian , but has a variance that depends on the model , then the posterior will not be gaussian , for a uniform prior on the models .",
    "we must therefore take care to distinguish likelihood and posterior .    in this work",
    ", we will quantify the data @xmath4 using the power spectra measured from some experiment , and the models @xmath5 by the same statistic .",
    "for an all - sky survey , where different modes are independent , the likelihood is f(**|*x * ) = _ l f(_l^xx|c_l^xx ) , where @xmath8 represents the measured power spectra , @xmath9 the model power spectra , and @xmath10 .",
    "the posterior that we are interested in , @xmath11 is dependent on the product of the likelihoods of individual multipoles . for a single multipole",
    ", we see that it is the dependence of the likelihood on the model power spectrum ( @xmath12 ) that is of interest . in this paper",
    "we refer to @xmath13 as the posterior for the power spectra , as it is related to @xmath14 using bayes theorem and a uniform prior on @xmath15 . for a given experiment , it is the posterior @xmath16 that tells us the model constraints provided by the data on a particular scale .",
    "it is worth emphasising that a cosmological likelihood analysis based on the work presented in our paper does not depend on the assumption of a uniform prior in the power spectra . instead , in such an analysis , the prior",
    "would be defined by the set of allowed models . in this paper",
    "we do not consider a specific set of cosmological models , and simply focus on the dependence of the likelihood on our chosen model statistic  the model power spectrum @xmath9 .",
    "we have decided to call this the posterior , simply because it can be considered in this way following the assumption of a uniform prior in @xmath17 . had we quantified the models by a different statistic , @xmath18 , then the prior on the allowed set of cosmological models @xmath7 is unchanged  if we considered a grid of cosmological models , then this grid is unchanged .",
    "the likelihood for each @xmath2 would have to be multiplied by @xmath19 to allow for the change of variables , but we see that this is independent of the model values . consequently , as we would hope , the same posterior distribution for the set of cosmological models would be recovered whatever statistic is used to quantify the models , provided there is no loss of information associated with this choice .",
    "in an all - sky , noiseless cmb survey , the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath20 of the temperature fluctuations obey a gaussian distribution f(a_lm^t|c_l^tt ) = , [ eq : stdgauss ] where @xmath21 .",

    "[ eq : fcl_gamma ] the mean and variance of this distribution are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that the maximum of this distribution occurs at @xmath33 , not at the mean value . in the limit @xmath34",
    ", the central limit theorem gives that this distribution tends towards a gaussian with the same mean and variance .",
    "using bayes theorem to convert to the posterior @xmath35 , assuming a uniform prior in @xmath36 gives f(c_l^tt|_l^tt ) ( c_l^tt)^-/2 , [ eq : cl_posterior ] where we have not included the normalisation factor dependent on @xmath27 .",
    "the maximum of this function occurs at @xmath27 , while the mean is given by c_l^tt=_l^tt .",
    "this offset between maximum and mean is simply a result of the skewness of the distribution . as @xmath34",
    ", this distribution will tend towards a gaussian form .",
    "this follows from the bayesian identity and the fact that @xmath37 tends to a gaussian distribution ( see the discussion following equation ( [ eq : l_epsilon_true ] ) ) .",
    "we can take the logarithm of the posterior to give -f(c_l^tt|_l^tt ) = ( c_l^tt + _ l^tt / c_l^tt ) , [ eq : lallsky ] ignoring an irrelevant additive constant . from this",
    ", we can calculate the curvature around the distribution maximum - .",
    "[ eq : fisher1 ]    there is an alternative way of deriving equation ( [ eq : lallsky ] ) by considering the joint probability density of @xmath20 for @xmath38 , f(a_l , m =- l^t, ... ,a_l , m = l^t |c_l^tt ) = _ m f(a_lm^t|c_l^tt ) . substituting for @xmath39 from equation ( [ eq : stdgauss ] ) ,",
    "this reduces to    - f(c_l^tt|_l^tt ) = _ m ( c_l^tt + |a_lm^t|^2 / c_l^tt ) , where once again , we have ignored an irrelevant additive component .",
    "we see that this distribution is only dependent on @xmath20 through @xmath27 , and that substituting in @xmath27 from equation ( [ eq : hatcl ] ) leads to the same @xmath31 dependence that we had in equation ( [ eq : lallsky ] ) .",
    "if we now include e - mode and b - mode polarisation data , there are 3 spherical harmonic coefficients of interest , @xmath20 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "there is a slight complication caused by defining @xmath49 as the average over the @xmath51 modes rather than the sum , which is used to derive the standard wishart distribution .",
    "@xmath49 still has a wishart distribution , but we need to consider the matrix @xmath52 rather than @xmath43 .",

    ", the wishart distribution tends towards a multi - variate gaussian form , with the same covariance matrix .",
    "it is worth noting that the matrix @xmath78 is also the curvature matrix around the distribution maximum , which will become important in sections  [ sec : posterior_fit_single ] and  [ sec : posterior_fit_multi ] .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the posterior distribution for a noise - less all - sky survey does not have a multi - variate gaussian form in the auto- and cross- power spectra at low @xmath23 .",

    "such effects are often dealt with by modifying the posterior distribution to match that found from detailed simulations of the particular experiment being considered ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this modified distribution can , in turn , be fitted by simple functional forms , thus allowing rapid calculation for any given cosmological model ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we briefly examine the effect of real - world complications on the posterior , which provide the motivation for our consideration of possible fits for the posterior distribution in section  [ sec : fits ] .",

    "for the cut sky coefficients for a particular mode , the estimator , @xmath27 , equation ( [ eq : hatcl ] ) , now sums over a linear combination of the @xmath1 .",
    "we can work around correlations between the @xmath79 by defining uncorrelated combinations ( which must be independent because they also form a multi - variate gaussian distribution ) .",
    "however , the distribution will consist of variables with differing variance , and therefore does not lead to a wishart distribution .",
    "additionally , modes at different @xmath2 will be correlated , again causing deviations from the analysis in section  [ sec : wishart ] .",
    "the introduction of any sky - cut to a cmb dataset renders the coupling kernel , @xmath81 of equation ( [ eq : alm_coupling ] ) , singular , and thus prohibits the use of equations ( [ eq : hatcl ] ) & ( [ eq : alm_coupling ] ) to estimate the underlying power spectra .",
    "various methods have therefore been developed for estimating cmb power spectra from cut - sky datasets , the most prominent of which are the pseudo-@xmath0 ( pcl , @xcite ) and quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml , @xcite , @xcite ) methods .",
    "there are two regimes that we can easily analyse - given a severe sky cut , both the pcl and qml estimators will modify the likelihood distribution from the full - sky wishart distribution of section  [ sec : wishart ] .",
    "however , on small scales , we can still apply the central limit theorem to show that the likelihood of the polarisation and temperature power spectra has a multi - variate gaussian distribution for both estimators .",
    "the covariance matrix of this gaussian distribution will change as a severe sky - cut gives rise to the loss of information  some linear combinations of the full - sky @xmath82 will define modes that lie within the cut sky and these modes can not be recovered from the observed @xmath79 .",

    "[ fig : l7_l100_offset_ln ] we therefore also plot the distribution along the principal components of the covariance matrix for these two values of @xmath2 . as can be seen , fitting the distribution along the power spectra does not constrain the distribution in other directions with the same accuracy .",
    "this is an inadequacy of our assumption of replacing the power spectra in equation ( [ eq : gauss_fix ] ) with a more general function , rather than a problem in the accuracy of the function chosen .",
    "we can match the function arbitrarily well in the directions of the power spectra , but the discrepancy in other directions remains .",
    "for example , in addition to using the offset log - normal distribution , we have also considered simply defining new variables as the sum of powers of @xmath164 , which can be adjusted to match the distribution to arbitrary order around the maximum .",
    "however , even in this case , we find similar problems to those encountered using the offset log - normal distribution .",
    "had we fixed these simple fits in the directions of the principal components , then we would have found problems fitting along the directions of the power spectra .",
    "one can , of course , envisage constructing more complicated fitting functions which more accurately reproduce correlations between different power spectra .",
    "such functions would , however , lack the simplicity ( and therefore some of the appeal ) of fits commonly used to model the temperature power spectrum posterior .",
    "for real cmb datasets , one often needs to account for an uncertainty in the calibration of the experiment .",
    "this uncertainty is usually considered a nuisance parameter and is marginalised over . for simple assumptions about the form of the underlying power spectrum",
    "posterior and of the calibration error , we can perform this marginalisation analytically . here , we consider the effect of the posterior shape on this marginalisation process . for this analysis ,",
    "we focus on a single auto - power spectrum . as in previous sections",
    ", we drop the explicit dependence on @xmath101 , @xmath102 or @xmath103 when the formulae and derivation are valid for any of these three auto - power spectra .",
    "consider an experiment where the observed data has a multiplicative `` calibration '' error , @xmath165 that is known to have a gaussian distribution ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) .",
    "if we know the calibration error , then the `` true '' observed power spectrum value can be recovered , @xmath168 .",
    "the posterior distribution of @xmath0 is then given by f(c_l|_l,_b ) = db f(c_l , b|_l,_b ) = db f(c_l|_l , b,_b)f(b|_b ) .",
    "if @xmath169 has a gaussian form with variance @xmath170 then , f(c_l|_l , b,_b ) = .",
    "this marginalisation can be reduced by `` completing the square '' @xcite to give f(c_l|_l,_b ) = ( 1+c_ls^-1c_l_b^2)^-1/2 f(c_l|_l , b,_b ) , [ eq : gauss_marg1 ] where b= , [ eq : gauss_marg2 ] is the value of the calibration that maximises @xmath171 .",
    "the offset term @xmath172 in equation ( [ eq : gauss_marg1 ] ) arises because the variance @xmath170 is independent of the calibration error .",
    "the procedure for analytic marginalisation is , however , dependent on the posterior distribution . for an auto - power spectrum of an all - sky no - noise survey ,",
    "the joint distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath165 is given by f(c_l , b|_l,_b ) ( c_l)^-/2 . as in section  [ sec : fits ] , we have ignored a contribution from uncorrelated gaussian pixel noise , which can be easily included as it does not affect the shape of the posterior distribution .",
    "completing the square ( as for the gaussian case above ) gives the marginalised posterior , f(c_l|_l,_b ) ( c_l)^-/2 , [ eq : anal_marg1 ] where b=- , [ eq : anal_marg2 ] is the value of the calibration error that maximises the distribution @xmath171 . as can be seen , analytic marginalisation is also trivial when the exact posterior distribution for an all - sky survey is used , rather than a gaussian . because of the skewness of this distribution , the result",
    "is offset  the value of the calibration error needed to mimic the effect of a full marginalisation is twice that which maximises the likelihood .",
    "this demonstrates the difference between marginalisation and simply taking the likelihood maximum .",
    "our decision to adopt a gaussian distribution for the calibration error for a single auto - power spectrum measurement was reasonably arbitrary , and we could instead , have considered a calibration error that is gaussian in the pixel values .",
    "when considering the joint likelihood of temperature and polarisation data , the nature of the calibration error becomes increasingly important .",
    "for example , assuming independent gaussian distributed temperature ( @xmath173 ) and polarisation ( @xmath174 ) calibration errors would give a calibration error on the te power spectrum with a distribution based on a modified bessel function  the distribution of @xmath175^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "obviously , this would complicate the procedure for analytic marginalisation .",
    "additionally , from a single experiment , the temperature and polarisation calibration errors will be highly correlated , which will further increase the complications .",
    "given these issues , there is clearly little to be gained from working through a derivation of analytic marginalisation for combined temperature and polarisation power spectra . for a given experiment , it seems clear that numerical simulations would be required to quantify the effect on the posterior .",
    "the ultimate goal of cmb experiments is to constrain cosmological models by comparison with theory . in the currently favoured inflationary based cosmological model , the temperature and polarisation fluctuations in the cmb",
    "are expected to be isotropic and approximately gaussian distributed @xcite . in this case , the statistical properties of the cmb can be described completely by the auto- and cross - power spectra of the temperature and polarisation fields .",
    "this data compression greatly speeds up the process of comparing with large numbers of theoretical models . in this paper , we have reviewed the mathematical foundation for this comparison . in a bayesian analysis",
    "the posterior , which determines the model constraints , is directly related to the likelihood of a set of data given a particular model ; it is therefore important to characterise the likelihood for a given experiment .",
    "for an all - sky survey with uncorrelated gaussian distributed pixel noise , we have shown that the joint likelihood of the four cmb power spectra is given by a wishart distribution , a distribution commonly encountered when calculating covariance matrices from gaussian distributed data .",
    "this distribution , which can most easily be written in terms of matrices of the data and model power spectra , provides the likelihood of the measured power spectra including the constraint of positive definiteness .",
    "the shape of the likelihood is significantly different from a multi - variate gaussian at low order multipoles , although it tends towards a multi - variate gaussian form at high multipoles .",
    "the wishart distribution can be integrated to give marginal distributions for the individual auto- and cross - power spectra . for the auto - power spectra",
    ", these marginalised distributions reduce to the well known @xmath30 functions . for the te cross - power spectrum ,",
    "the marginalised distribution is more complicated , but can be calculated .",
    "we find that the resulting distribution for te is significantly different to the @xmath30 distributions of the auto power spectra and is closer to ( although still differs from ) a gaussian .",
    "we have compared the marginalised distributions with those empirically determined from simulated data , finding excellent agreement .",
    "realistically , cmb observations that include polarisation measurements will simultaneously provide constraints on all of the auto- and cross - power spectra .",
    "consequently , the marginal distributions are probably only of academic interest , and we need to consider the combined distribution of all of the different power spectra .    given the complications of noise and limited sky coverage in real cmb data ( discussed in section  [ sec : complications ] ) , the distribution of measured power spectra will , in general , deviate from a wishart distribution to some degree .",
    "however , for a moderate sky cut , it is possible to recover the true temperature auto - power spectrum on large scales . in the case of polarisation data , large uncertainties in the level of polarised foregrounds",
    "are currently a limiting factor for cmb experiments .",
    "if our understanding of such foregrounds improves sufficiently , then it may be possible to recover the full - sky versions of all four cmb power spectra from future experiments . in that case",
    ", the wishart distribution will be the correct distribution to use for comparing models and data on large scales .    to account for the effect of limited sky coverage on the posterior shape ,",
    "it has become common practice to model an empirically determined posterior shape using simple fitting functions .",
    "we have considered a number of different fits to the posterior for a single auto - power spectrum in section  [ sec : posterior_fit_single ] , and have extended these simple 1-dimensional fits to cover the combined analysis of temperature and polarisation data .",
    "the most commonly used fitting function for auto - power spectra is the offset log - normal distribution . in section  [ sec : posterior_fit_single ] , it was shown that this is a member of a wider class of models that form a particular extension of the standard gaussian posterior form .",
    "consequently , the extension of the log - normal distribution to consider the combination of polarisation and temperature data is straightforward , following the natural extension of the gaussian distribution to a multi - variate gaussian .",
    "a good test of the validity of a fitting function is its ability to match the known posterior distribution for an all - sky survey . for the multi - variate analogue of the log - normal distribution",
    "there is a problem , not in its ability to fit to the posterior in the direction of a particular power spectrum , but in fitting correlations between the different power spectra . in fact , we have argued that this problem must be fundamental to the class of models which adopt the same form for the posterior ( in the notation of section  [ sec : posterior_fit_multi ] where some @xmath127 is adopted ) .    an alternative approach to fitting to the power spectra is to directly fit the pixel data .",
    "this has the advantage that the pixel values have a multi - variate gaussian distribution and the posterior shape is therefore well known and simple to characterise .",
    "however , since it requires the inversion of a @xmath176 pixel - pixel covariance matrix , this method can only be easily employed on cmb maps with relatively coarse pixelisation , and can therefore only be used to probe the largest scales . to probe smaller scales ,",
    "more resolution is required and the method rapidly becomes computationally unfeasible with increasing number of pixels .",
    "the wmap team in their 3-year data analysis adopted a hybrid approach where the pixel data were directly fitted on large scales ( @xmath177 for temperature and @xmath178 for polarisation ) , and the tt and te power spectra were fitted on smaller scales ( @xmath179 and @xmath180 ; @xcite ) . on large scales , this has the attractive benefit of avoiding the issues arising from the complicated posterior shape for the power spectra ",
    "the real world complications discussed in section  [ sec : complications ] do not distort the likelihood of the pixel values from a multi - variate gaussian distribution .    in section  [ sec : marginalise ]",
    "we have applied our analysis of posterior shapes to consider marginalisation over nuisance parameters , focusing on an unknown calibration error . given a form for the posterior distribution",
    ", it is possible to perform this marginalisation analytically , leading to a simple correction to the posterior for this `` nuisance '' parameter .",
    "this analytic correction avoids having to explicitly perform the integration .",
    "obviously the analytic form is dependent on the posterior shape , and it has previously been common to assume a gaussian posterior @xcite . in section  [ sec : marginalise ] , we provide an additional calculation using the true likelihood of an all - sky survey . because of the offset nature of this distribution we find a different formula for analytically performing the marginalisation .    the analysis presented in this paper",
    "has highlighted the issues involved in a likelihood analysis of combined temperature and polarisation power spectra , and provides the first step on the way to providing a well - characterised method for the fast analysis of combined temperature and polarisation data from future experiments . in subsequent papers",
    "we intend to build on this work by considering the practical application of these techniques and the possible modifications needed for analysing upcoming joint temperature and polarisation experiments such as the planck experiment @xcite . with the precision with which future experiments will measure the cmb temperature and polarisation fields , the likelihood techniques presented in this paper will become increasingly important for accurately constraining cosmological models from these data .",
