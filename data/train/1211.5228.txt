    "the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) is one of the physical quantities that are extremely sensitive to the cp violation in the high - energy theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the contribution of the sm electroweak interactions to the neutron edm , @xmath5 , has been evaluated as @xmath6 @xcite , which is still below the experimental limit @xmath7 @xcite by several orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the neutron edm provides a clean , background - free probe of the cp - violating interactions in physics beyond the sm , as well as the so - called @xmath8 term in the qcd lagrangian . in order to look for the neutron edm ,",
    "various experiments have been proposed and put into practice .",
    "their sensitivities are expected to be much improved mainly due to the use of ultra cold neutrons . for instance , the nedm collaboration at the paul - scherrer institute ( psi ) @xcite aims at giving a sensitivity of @xmath9 , and finally getting into the regime of @xmath10 .    from a theoretical point of view , on the other hand , one needs to interpret the value of or the limits on the neutron edm provided by experiments in terms of the cp violation at parton level .",
    "to that end , there have been a lot of previous efforts to derive precise relations between the cp - violating interactions and the neutron edm . at the moment",
    ", only an approach exploiting the qcd sum rules @xcite provides a systematic treatment for the derivation , which has been conducted in various literature @xcite . in this approach",
    ", it is possible to include the contribution of the qcd @xmath8 term , the quark edms , and the quark chromoelectric dipole moments ( cedms ) on an equal footing .",
    "the qcd lattice simulations also offer a promising way of evaluating the neutron edm induced by such cp - violating interactions .",
    "although their results are not precise enough at present @xcite , we expect that the lattice simulations eventually will be able to determine it with high accuracy .",
    "an alternative , in fact a traditional , approach to the calculation of the neutron edm is based on the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this method has the advantage of being able to include sea quark effects indirectly , while in the qcd sum rule method such effects appear only at the higher orders .",

    "@xcite , the quark cedm contributions are also discussed . while the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xcite is often considered in order to suppress the @xmath8 term and solve the strong cp problem , it is important to evaluate the neutron edm induced by the higher dimensional operators , such as the quark cedms , which are sensitive to tev - scale physics . in the calculation ,",
    "the effects of the cp - violating operators are incorporated into the cp - odd meson - baryon couplings , which are obtained by evaluating the nucleon matrix elements of the cp - even quark scalar operators .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite extracted the matrix elements from the baryon mass splittings and the nucleon sigma terms also evaluated in terms of the chiral perturbation theory , which suggested the sea - quark contribution , especially that of strange quark , might be considerably large .",
    "the recent lattice simulations , on the other hand , show that the nucleon matrix element of the strange quark scalar operator is actually quite small contrary to one s expectation .",
    "since several independent groups have calculated the values with high accuracy and obtained similar results by using the different methods , the results have become reliable compared with the previous estimates .",
    "moreover , a latest calculation based on the covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory in ref .",
    "@xcite actually gives a smaller value for the strangeness content of nucleon than those in the previous studies .",
    "indeed , it is consistent with the lattice results , while its error is much larger than those with the lattice simulations .",
    "this situation stimulates the reevaluation of the neutron edm based on the chiral perturbation theory with the use of up - to - date results for the nucleon matrix elements . after the calculation",
    ", we will find that although the strangeness quantity in nucleon is small , the contribution of the cedm of strange quark may be sizable , or , even be dominant .",
    "while the chiral loop computation , especially in the case of the kaon loop diagrams , might yield large uncertainty , it is found that similar consequences are achieved , with the cut - off scale of the loop integral varied within a moderate region .",
    "this result indicates that the strange quark cedm still may play an important role in probing the cp - violating interactions in physics beyond the sm .",

    "taking the results obtained above into consideration , we conclude that although the recent lattice results indicate that the amount of strange quark in nucleon is small , the cedm of strange quark may play an important role in probing the cp - violating interactions in physics beyond the sm with the neutron edm .    finally , as a reference value , we present the numerical results for the relation between the cedms and the neutron edm : @xmath186 - 1.4\\tilde{d}_u+0.7\\tilde{d}_d+0.4\\tilde{d}_s ) , \\label{dn}\\ ] ] where we take @xmath179 and use @xmath123 in eq .",

    "especially , we focus on the strange cedm contribution to the neutron edm . although the lattice qcd simulations tell us that the strangeness content in nucleon is small , it is found the contribution may not be suppressed .",
    "there are two origins of the theoretical error in our calculation ; one is unknown counterterms in the effective lagrangian which contribute to the neutron edm at tree level , and the other is the evaluation of @xmath57 by using the method of qcd sum rules .",
    "the former is somewhat inevitable until one fixes all of the low - energy constants for the counterterms .",

    "further , the lattice qcd simulations might compute @xmath57 directly .",
    "it allows us to make a prediction of neutron edm much precisely with error estimated more systematically .    at present , we conclude that the contribution of strange quark cedm may be still significant , and therefore it might offer a sensitive probe for the cp - violating interactions in physics beyond the standard model .",
