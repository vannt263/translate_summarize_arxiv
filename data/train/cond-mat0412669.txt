    "in 1958 anderson formulated a simple tight - binding model with uncorrelated on - site ( diagonal ) disorder and predicted a localization - delocalization transition  ( ldt ) in three dimensions  ( 3d ) : a phase of extended states appears at the band center in the thermodynamic limit if the disorder magnitude is smaller than a critical value , while all states are localized at larger magnitudes of disorder .",
    "@xcite the phase of delocalized states is separated from the two phases of localized states by two mobility edges .",
    "@xcite the concept of the mobility edge is of key importance for the low - temperature transport properties of disordered materials .    since the advent of the single - parameter scaling hypothesis , introduced by abrahams  _ et al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite the occurrence of a localization - delocalization transition ( ldt ) in disordered systems with time reversal symmetry was ruled out in one-  ( 1d ) and two dimensional  ( 2d ) geometries at any disorder strength ( for the overview see refs .  ) .",
    "the localized nature of the states in 1d was pointed out even earlier by mott and twose.@xcite    at the end of eighties and beginning of nineties it was realized however that correlations in disorder may give rise to extended states in low dimensions .",
    "thus , short - range correlated on - site disorder was found to cause the appearance of extended states at special resonance energies in 1d .",
    "they form a set of null measure in the density of states in the thermodynamic limit ,  @xcite implying the absence of the mobility edges in those models . in spite of this fact , even the infinitesimal fraction of the extended states may have a strong impact on the transport properties of disordered materials .",
    "in particular , short - range correlations in disordered potential were put forward to explain unusual conducting properties of polymers , such as polyaniline and heavily doped polyacetylene ,  @xcite as well as semiconductor superlattices grown with random but correlated quantum well sequences .",
    "@xcite    contrary to short - range correlations in the disorder distribution , long - range correlations were demonstrated to cause the ldt in  1d systems , which is analogous to the standard anderson ldt in 3d .",
    "@xcite in this regard , a 1d system with nearest - neighbor interactions and long - range correlated on - site disorder distribution with a power - like spectrum @xmath5 is critical with respect to the exponent @xmath6 . more specifically , when the standard deviation of the energy distribution equals the nearest - neighbor hopping and @xmath7 all states are localized , while for @xmath8 a phase of extended states appears at the center of the band giving rise to two mobility edges .",
    "the phase occupies a finite fraction of the density of states .",

    "this model is critical _ with respect to the interaction exponent _ @xmath6 : for @xmath11 all states are localized , while all of them are delocalized at @xmath12 , suggesting that @xmath13 is the critical point in the model . within the framework of this model",
    ", it was demonstrated rigorously that ( i )  the distribution function of the inverse participation ratio is scale invariant at transition and ( ii )  the relative fluctuation of the inverse participation ratio ( the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean ) is of the order of unity at the critical point .",
    "@xcite this finding confirmed the conjecture ( which was put forward earlier  @xcite ) , that distributions of relevant physical magnitudes are universal at criticality ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "the invariance can therefore be used to monitor the critical point .",
    "@xcite    recently , several reports addressed to the unusual localization properties of  1d and  2d tight - binding models with uncorrelated diagonal disorder and _ non - random _ long - range coupling between sites @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which falls according to a power law @xmath16 ,   ( see also refs .  - ) .",

    "the states at the other band - edge are strongly localized , no matter how small the disorder magnitude is , thus , suggesting the existence of a single mobility edge.@xcite at @xmath20 all states were found to be localized .",
    "the character of localization , however , turned out to be governed by the interaction exponent @xmath4 . at @xmath21 , the upper band - edge states are weakly localized , similar to those at the center of the band in the standard 2d anderson model ,  @xcite while at @xmath22 they are strongly localized .",
    "in the present paper we deal with the analysis , both numerical and analytical , of the localization properties of the latter class of 1d  hamiltonians .",
    "we calculate the phase diagram of the transition for the upper band - edge states , i.e. , the critical disorder magnitude @xmath23 versus the interaction exponent @xmath4 , and show that @xmath23 vanishes as @xmath24 when @xmath25 , while it diverges as @xmath26 when @xmath27 . applying the finite size scaling analysis we study the problem of the mobility edge and show that the mobility edge approaches to the upper band edge in the thermodynamic limit . in other words , the fraction of the delocalized states forms a set of null measure , although their number tends to infinity on increasing the system size @xmath28 as @xmath29 ( note that the dependence is sub - linear ) .",
    "this numerical finding is supported by a simple qualitative arguments based on the comparison of size scaling of two magnitudes : the bare level spacing at the band - edge and effective disorder _ seen _ by the quasiparticle .",

    "first , we address the disorder - free system ( @xmath40 ) , taking periodic boundary conditions for the sake of simplicity .",
    "then the eigenstates of the hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) are plane waves with quasi - momenta @xmath41 within the first brillouin zone @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding eigenenergies are given by @xmath43 where the summation runs over all @xmath28 sites of the lattice , and @xmath4 is assumed to be larger than unity to get a bounded energy spectrum .",
    "the complete account for all terms in the sum  ( [ energyk ] ) is important in the neighborhood of the upper band - edge , where the long - range hopping terms affect the dispersion vastly . at the upper band - edge ( @xmath44 ) the dispersion relation  ( [ energyk ] )",

    ", @xmath47 is the upper band - edge energy in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are dimensionless positive constants on the order of unity ( for brevity we do not provide explicit expressions for them ) , and @xmath50 is the riemann @xmath51-function . for small @xmath52 , the sub - quadratic term in the right - hand side of eq .",

    ", the inequality @xmath65 gets even stronger , so that the perturbation becomes weaker and therefore the upper states will remain delocalized at @xmath66 . on the other hand , large disorder ( say , larger than the bare bandwidth ) would certainly localize all the states .",
    "these arguments indicate that there can exist extended states at the upper band - edge at finite disorder , provided that @xmath67 .",
    "this conjecture was confirmed both theoretically , by means of the renormalization group approach combined with a super - symmetric method for disorder averaging  @xcite , and numerically .",
    "@xcite the value @xmath68 represents the marginal case in which the upper band - edge states are localized weakly .",
    "@xcite in what follows , we focus therefore on the interaction exponent @xmath4 ranging within the interval @xmath69 .    at the bottom of the band @xmath55 the level spacing diminishes as @xmath70 , that is faster than the effective magnitude of disorder @xmath61 .",
    "thus , even if @xmath65 for some lattice size and the states are extended over the whole system , the inequality will be reversed for larger @xmath28 , which will finally result in strong coupling of the states and their eventual localization .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the entire energy spectrum if @xmath71 .",

    "( [ muto1 ] ) , the critical magnitude of disorder diverges as @xmath83 when @xmath84 .",
    "the explanation of the divergence relies in the fact that @xmath85 for @xmath86 ,  @xcite and the upper band - edge energy @xmath87 diverges when @xmath88 as @xmath89 .",
    "contrary to that , the critical magnitude of disorder vanishes as @xmath90 when @xmath72 , indicating that in the marginal case ( @xmath68 ) the uppermost state is localized ( @xmath91 ) , in full agreement with the results obtained by the renormalization group approach combined with a super - symmetric method for disorder averaging .",
    "having discussed the dependence of the critical magnitude of disorder @xmath23 on the interaction exponent @xmath4 for the uppermost state , we now focus on the mobility edge and the fraction of extended states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this question has not been addressed in previous studies ,  @xcite except for a comment on the existence of a single mobility edge  @xcite ( see also the discussion in sec .  [ model ] ) .    to work out this problem , we numerically diagonalized the hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) and calculated the normalized mpn , @xmath92 , as a function of energy for different system sizes @xmath28 . the results of these simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for a particular set of interaction exponent and magnitude of disorder ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",

    "the inset shows an enlarged view close to the upper band edge . ]    in order to avoid the size dependence of the upper band - edge , we use hereafter the state index @xmath77 rather than the energy @xmath101 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plotted the mpn as a function of the normalized state index @xmath102 .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the mpn is independent of the system size in a wide range of the normalized state index @xmath102 .",
    "the perfect collapse of the curves within this range clearly indicates the localized nature of these eigenstates .",
    "however , at the top of the band the mpn increases linearly with the system size and the collapse is absent ( see the blow - up in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this result suggests that not only the uppermost eigenstate , but a number of them are delocalized , in agreement with the previous claim raised in ref .",
    "we now apply a finite size analysis of our numerical results to further confirm the latter statement and to obtain the size scaling of the number of extended eigenstates .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows that the mpn for different sizes collapses onto a single curve close to the top of the band after introducing the rescaled index @xmath103 for @xmath93 .",
    "the collapse holds up to a finite value of the rescaled index , which indicates that the number of extended states scales as @xmath104 when @xmath93 .     for different system sizes calculated for @xmath93 and @xmath94 . ]    to provide support to these numerical results , we now develop a simple ( perturbative ) analytical approach that allows us to understand the origin of the obtained results . to this end , we analyze the energy spacing close to the upper band - edge in the disorder - free system ( @xmath40 ) more accurately .",
    "the spacing can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ top ] ) : @xmath105 the constant @xmath106 absorbs all unessential numerical factors . note the absence of the scaling of the spacing @xmath107 , i.e. , the spacing depends on @xmath77 not only on @xmath102 .",
    "this is crucial for the peculiar features of the ldt within the model .",
    "indeed , consider a chain of a particular size @xmath28 .",
    "assume that the disorder is perturbative for the uppermost state ( @xmath108 ) , i.e. , @xmath109 , so that states at the top are extended over the whole sample .",
    "let us now find the _ mobility edge _ for this finite lattice , defining it by the equality @xmath110 the number @xmath111 , which is @xmath28-dependent , divides all eigenstates into two sets : those with @xmath112 are delocalized in the above sense , while eigenstates with @xmath113 are localized in the usual sense .",

    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the normalized mean participation number as a function of @xmath120 calculated for different disorder strength @xmath17 and a given system size @xmath121 .",
    "the collapse of all curves onto a single one in the vicinity of the upper band - edge supports the validity of eq .",

    "( [ kc ] ) against numerical simulations performed for other values of @xmath123 and always found an excellent agreement of the numerical data with the analytic formula  ( [ kc ] ) .",
    "it follows from the formula that the number of extended states increases sub - linearly with the system size , namely as @xmath29 , which means that the fraction of these states vanishes as @xmath124 when @xmath88 . from this",
    "we conclude that the mobility edge approaches to the upper band edge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we studied both analytically and numerically the localization properties of the 1d tight - binding model with diagonal disorder and _ non - random _ long - range inter - site interactions , @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "the model can be critical at the upper band - edge provided @xmath1 .",
    "we calculated the phase diagram of the transition ( the dependence of the critical magnitude of disorder @xmath23 on the interaction exponent @xmath4 ) by studying the participation number statistics .",
    "the critical magnitude of disorder was detected using the size invariance of the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean .",
    "we found that @xmath23 diverges as @xmath127 when @xmath84 , which originates from the similar divergence of the upper band - edge energy .",
    "if @xmath72 , the critical disorder magnitude vanishes as @xmath128 , indicating that all states are localized at @xmath68 , no matter how small the disorder is .",
    "it is shown , both analytically and by means of the finite size scaling analysis , that the number of extended states at the upper band - edge increases sub - linearly with the system size @xmath28 , namely as @xmath129 ) , therefore forming a set of null measure in the density of states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this suggests that the mobility edge is only a meaningful concept for a finite size system ; it approaches to the upper band - edge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "although extended states form an infinitesimal fraction of the whole density of states , they can provide a strong impact on the transport properties , similarly to what happens in systems with correlated randomness .",
    "@xcite    to conclude , we note that our findings , apart from being interesting from the theoretical point of view , are relevant for real physical systems .",
    "thus , some organic materials with planar geometry , in which optically allowed excitations are dipolar frenkel excitons ,   represent an example ; the value of the interaction exponent for the dipole - dipole inter - site interaction is @xmath130 , which resembles the weak localization regime in the 1d long - range model when @xmath68 .",
