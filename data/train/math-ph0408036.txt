    "this paper deals with the problem of improving the convergence of a slowly convergent series where a large number of terms is needed to reach the desired accuracy .",
    "this is a challenging problem , which has been considered before ( see , for example , @xcite ) and which has interesting applications in many physical problems . as a matter of fact",
    "it is well known that perturbation theory often gives series which converge very slowly or do not converge at all ( one example is the perturbative series for the quantum anharmonic oscillator , which was originally studied in  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method to accelerate some class of mathematical series , which does not rely on a perturbative approach , i.e. on an expansion in some small natural parameter ( a parameter present in the original expression ) .",
    "the method works by introducing an artificial dependence in the formulas upon an arbitrary parameter , by identifying a new `` perturbation '' and by then devising an expansion which can be optimized to give faster rates of convergence .",
    "the details of how this works will be explained in depth in the next section .",
    "this procedure is well known in physics and it has been exploited in the so - called `` linear delta expansion '' ( lde ) and variational perturbation theory ( vpt ) approaches  @xcite .",
    "we will show in the following that such techniques can be used to obtain exponentially convergent series for some mathematical functions .",
    "a proof of convergence of the method is also provided .",
    "the `` flexibility '' and simplicity of the method that we propose suggests that application to wider classes of series could be found .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec_mc ] we first introduce the method and then use it to obtain accelerate series for @xmath0 and for the catalan constant ; in sections [ sec_zf ] and [ sec_hf ] we obtain a family of series representations for the riemann and hurwitz zeta functions which all converge in a certain domain of the arbitrary parameter ; finally in section [ concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "many fundamental mathematical constants can be expressed as infinite sums . in many cases",
    "such series converge very slowly and a huge number of terms has to be calculated before reaching the desired precision .",
    "several examples of this are discussed for example in @xcite , where the authors consider a particular rearrangement of the series which transforms them into rapidly converging series . in the following we review two of the examples of @xcite , @xmath0 and the catalan constant , and",
    "obtain new series representations for these constants which display a fast rate of convergence .",
    "we first consider the series @xmath1 \\ ,",
    "\\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which converges very slowly to @xmath0 and it is known as gregory s formula .",
    "the sum of the to the first @xmath2 terms yields an approximate value of @xmath0 , which only has the first @xmath3 decimals correct .",
    "flajolet and vardi  @xcite have shown that it is possible to convert series such as the one in equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) into rapidly converging ones . here",
    "we generalize the method of flajolet and vardi , introducing an arbitrary parameter in the series .",
    "such parameter is then tuned to accelerate the convergence of the series itself by using the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms )  @xcite .",
    "[ thm1 ] the series @xmath4 converges to @xmath0 for @xmath5 , with @xmath6 real .",
    "proof    we write the series of equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) in the equivalent form @xmath7 with an arbitrary parameter @xmath8 .    provided that @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for all @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 , we can expand equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) as @xmath13 \\nonumber   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as the series in @xmath14 and @xmath15 contain only positive terms , we can perform the series over @xmath15 and obtain the result @xmath16    the series of equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) for @xmath17 coincides with the result of flajolet and vardi  @xcite : @xmath18 and converges geometrically to @xmath0 .",
    "notice that equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) defines a family of series converging to @xmath0 as long as @xmath12 .",
    "clearly the dependence upon @xmath6 in equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) is artificial and shows up only when a finite number of terms is considered . if we set @xmath19 to be the partial series of equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) the dependence upon @xmath6 in @xmath19 then disappears in the limit @xmath20 .    for fixed @xmath21",
    "we evaluate the partial sum at the points where @xmath22 , since there the expression is less sensitive to changes of the arbitrary parameter @xmath6 , a property which shares with the full series ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "this is called principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms )  @xcite and provides an equation which , once solved at a given order , provides an _ optimal _ value of @xmath6 for a fixed partial sum @xmath19 .    for @xmath23",
    "we obtain @xmath24    the series of equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) converges geometrically to @xmath0 .",

    "this follows from equation  ( [ eq8a ] ) for @xmath41 applying the pms @xmath46 the optimal value of @xmath6 taking the first two terms in the series @xmath47 and equation ( [ eq11 ] ) is obtained .     as a function of the number of terms in the sum using equation  ( [ eq6 ] ) ( diamonds ) , equation  ( [ eq9a ] ) ( circles ) , equation  ( [ eq9 ] ) ( pluses ) and equation  ( [ eq11 ] ) ( triangles).[fig3],width=377 ]    in figure  [ fig3 ] we compare the different approximations , showing that equation  ( [ eq9 ] ) ( with @xmath48 ) and equation  ( [ eq11 ] ) have a greater rate of convergence then the corresponding equation in @xcite .",

    "although @xmath6 appears explicitly in the series ( [ s4_3 ] ) , the series itself does not depend upon @xmath6 , as long as @xmath56 .",
    "however the partial sums @xmath66 , defined as @xmath67 must show a dependence upon @xmath6 .",
    "however such dependence may be minimized by applying the pms , i.e. @xmath68    to lowest order , which corresponds to sum up to @xmath69 , one has that @xmath70 and the corresponding formula is found to be : @xmath71     obtained by using equation  ( [ s4_4 ] ) to different orders .",

    "having proved our fundamental result , equation  ( [ eq_2 ] ) , we now discuss some of the properties of the new series .",
    "we first stress that ( [ eq_2 ] ) is independent of the arbitrary parameter @xmath6 , although @xmath6 appears explicitly in the expression .",
    "this happens because equation  ( [ s3_1a ] ) is independent of @xmath6 and it has just been proved that our new series , equation  ( [ eq_2 ] ) converges to equation  ( [ s3_1a ] ) provided that @xmath133 and @xmath127 . in other words",
    "we can say that equation  ( [ eq_2 ] ) describes a family of series , each corresponding to a different value of @xmath6 and each converging to the same series , equation  ( [ s3_1a ] ) .",
    "consider the partial sum @xmath134 obtained by restricting the infinite sum to the first @xmath135 terms .",
    "obviously @xmath136 depends upon @xmath6 as a result of having neglected an infinite number of terms .",
    "we can use this feature to our advantage and fix @xmath6 so that the convergence rate of the series is maximal .",
    "the proper value of @xmath6 is chosen using the pms , which amounts to find @xmath6 fulfilling the equation @xmath137    a straightforward mathematical interpretation of this condition is that the value of @xmath6 complying with this equation also minimizes the difference  @xcite @xmath138 ^ 2 \\ .\\ ] ]    to lowest order , which corresponds to choosing @xmath139 , one obtains the optimal value @xmath140 which can be used as long as @xmath141 .",
    "notice that , since @xmath85 depends upon @xmath142 then @xmath143 will not be a polynomial in @xmath142 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we had chosen @xmath31 , then @xmath144 would be a polynomial of @xmath145 order in @xmath142 . in that case",
    "however the convergence of the series would be strictly limited to the region @xmath146 .",
    "for this reason we will refer to our accelerated series corresponding to @xmath85 and to @xmath31 as being `` nonperturbative '' and `` perturbative '' respectively .     as a function of the number of terms in the sum.[fig7],width=377 ]    in figure  [ fig7 ] we plot the difference @xmath147 as a function of the number of terms in the sum of equation ( [ s3_1a ] ) .",
    "in this case @xmath148 is close to @xmath149 and ( [ s3_1a ] ) converges very slowly .",
    "the horizontal lines are the values obtained by using equation  ( [ eq_2 ] ) with the optimal value given in the equation ( [ eq_pms ] ) .",
    "the variational approach that we have described in this paper allows in many cases to convert a slowly converging series into a series which converges exponentially . in most cases",
    "the results that are obtained by following this approach are explicit .",
    "although we have considered only a few examples , we believe that it should be possible to apply this method to a larger class of series .",
    "indeed the results of  @xcite , which focus on the calculation of the period of a classical oscillator , and of  @xcite , which focusses on the calculation of the spectrum a quantum oscillator in the wkb approximation , provide a similar series representation for elliptic functions . in @xcite the author",
    "has also applied the accelerated series for the generalized hurwitz zeta function obtained in the present paper to the calculation of bosonic one loop integrals at finite temperature in quantum field theory . the author and",
    "collaborators are presently applying the results of this paper to the calculation of the casimir energy for massive scalar fields between parallel plates  @xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "the strongest results of the present paper are equations ( [ s4_3 ] ) and ( [ s4_4 ] ) ; it remains to study the possible uses of such equations both in mathematical and physical problems ( for example , these equations could be used to further improve the rate of convergence of series such as the one in equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) ) .",
