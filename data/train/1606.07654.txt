    "the theoretical work of recent years has led to a considerably better understanding of the origin of electronic correlations in materials with wide bands and relatively weak coulomb interactions , such as iron - based superconductors and ruthenates .",
    "based on the dynamical mean - field theory calculations ( dmft )  @xcite it has been realized that a small multiplet splitting coming from the hund s rule part of the coulomb interaction ( @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the bandwidth , @xmath3 hubbard interaction ) has drastic effects at low energy scales  @xcite .",
    "this has important consequences for the physics of these materials that are hence being referred to as the hund s metals  @xcite .",
    "impurity models play a major role in the dmft studies since the problem of the bulk is mapped to a problem of a quantum impurity embedded in a self - consistently determined bath .",
    "it is interesting to note that whereas in the single - orbital setting the relevant impurity problem was well explored  @xcite prior to the development of the dmft , this is not the case for multi - orbital systems where the dmft calculations preceded  @xcite the detailed investigation of the impurity models upon which those calculations are based .",
    "the discovery of the strong influence of the hund s rule coupling within the dmft has encouraged studies of multi - orbital effects also for adatoms on metal surfaces .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we study the three - orbital impurity problem with kanamori interaction @xmath4 relevant for instance to the dmft description of a transition - metal oxide with partially occupied @xmath0 shells . in three - orbital systems ,",

    "hamiltonian in eq .   has a su(2 ) spin and so(3 ) orbital symmetry .",
    "the low - energy properties of the model defined by eq .   have not been studied so far .",
    "the effects of the hund s rule coupling were explored for several simpler ( mostly two - orbital ) models  @xcite .",
    "the common conclusion of these works is that the hund s rule coupling suppresses the kondo temperature through reduced exchange coupling of the low - lying impurity spin degrees of freedom with conduction electrons .    more recently , a dworin - narath ( dn ) impurity model  @xcite was studied  @xcite .",
    "the dn model is described in terms of the simplified interaction hamiltonian @xmath7 which is similar to eq .  , but without the orbital part of the hund s interaction , @xmath8 .",
    "the dn model has a higher su(3 ) orbital symmetry and different fixed points .",
    "this work has led to important qualitative insights into the physics of hund s metal .",

    "@xcite derived a kondo hamiltonian with a su(@xmath9 ) orbital and su(@xmath10 ) spin symmetry and argued that the key property is that the spin - spin kondo coupling is ferromagnetic ( or small ) and that a two - stage screening of spin and orbital degrees of freedom occurs ( see also an earlier pioneering study  @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis stressed the importance of different spin and orbital degeneracy .",
    "these findings were corroborated by the numerical - renormalization - group ( nrg ) study in ref .",

    "given the deep implications of these results it is important to investigate the problem for the more realistic interaction term that is actually used in the dmft calculations .",
    "in this paper we investigate the low - energy physics of the anderson impurity model ( aim ) with kanamori interaction at occupancy close to @xmath11 which is relevant to hund s metals .",
    "we derive the corresponding kondo hamiltonian using the schrieffer - wolff transformation .",
    "the distinction between the kanamori and the dworin - narath hamiltonian is found to become asymptotically irrelevant : at low energies , the orbital so(3 ) symmetry is dynamically enlarged to the larger su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "consequently , the qualitative picture of the two - stage screening applies also for the kanamori hamiltonian .",
    "we also performed the nrg simulations that confirm these weak - coupling rg findings .",
    "we calculated the dependence of spin and orbital kondo temperatures for a range of parameters and electron occupancies .",
    "except at very low values of the hund s rule coupling strength , the spin kondo temperature is significantly smaller ( an order of magnitude or more ) .",
    "the smaller bare value of the spin - kondo coupling as well as its slower running both contribute to such behavior .",
