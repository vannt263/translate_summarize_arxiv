    "the mass model of a galaxy consists of two components : the stellar mass and the dark matter halo .",

    "our mass models also include a spherical dark matter halo . from analysing cold dark matter simulations ,",

    "we recover the mean relation below @xmath193 well .",
    "as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ bias_tri ] , [ mass_tri ] and [ fr_ml ] , the relationship for more massive galaxies is not well reproduced due to the fact that galaxies at the high mass end are generally more prolate . for low resolution",
    "mock galaxies , the relationship is not well reproduced for all masses , again showing the importance of high - resolution images .",
    "for this investigation , we have used mock galaxies from the state - of - the - art hydrodynamical illustris simulation to study the effectiveness and limitations of the jam modelling technique .",
    "even though our findings are jam based , we believe they are worthy of consideration for all jeans equation modelling . whilst our study explored diverse galaxies from a cosmological simulation , the study has a number of areas that could be improved upon in a future investigation .",
    "we discuss these in more detail below .",
    "although the illustris simulation can reproduce a variety of observational data , it can not yet accurately match the stellar mass function ( for example ) , and so it has limitations in terms of resembling real galaxies .",
    "the softening length in the simulation for baryons is @xmath200 , and this may affect the dynamics of stars in the central regions ( @xmath201 ) of galaxies .",
    "however most of our galaxies have effective radii larger than @xmath102 kpc ( see fig .  [ stellar_mass ] ) .",
    "in addition , we find no correlation between accuracy of the recovered stellar mass and effective radius , so we believe the effects of the softening length are not significant .",
    "this issue can only be conclusively understood when future higher - resolution simulations become available .",
    "furthermore , better imaging data and more sophisticated modelling techniques such as schwarzschild and m2 m may better remove this degeneracy .",
    "nevertheless , it will be interesting to examine further the internal dynamical structures of galaxies from simulations , for example the velocity anisotropy parameters as a function of radius , and their variation as a function of stellar mass and galaxy shape .    in modelling our mock observations , for simplicity , we did not use any data smoothing techniques such as cloud - in - cell .",
    "we have experimented with cloud - in - cell and find that our results are nearly unchanged for galaxies with median size or larger . even for the smallest galaxies , where it might be expected that smoothing would have a more significant impact , only minor differences in stellar mass recovery resulted .",
    "in our work , when setting the @xmath78 prior boundary , we use additional information from the simulated galaxies ( inner star and dark matter slope distributions , see fig .",
    "[ slope_distribution ] ) .",
    "note that even if we set a broader prior for @xmath78 ( e.g. @xmath202 $ ] ) , the degeneracy between dark matter and stellar mass does not increase much ( scatter increased by @xmath203 ) compared with the @xmath204 original scatter . the reason we set a narrower prior ( @xmath205 $ ] ) according to fig .",
    "[ slope_distribution ] is to be consistent with @xcite , who used a similar approach to set the prior for their dark matter slope distributions .    in this study",
    ", we assumed the whole galaxy has a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio , and this is a commonly adopted approach in dynamical modelling .",
    "in fact , hydrodynamical simulations now contain information about star formation and chemical abundances for the stellar populations , thus it will be interesting to incorporate such information in future dynamical modelling , e.g. , the @xmath2 gradient ( ge et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) .",
    "furthermore , it will be interesting to explore and model chemo - dynamical correlations .",
    "we have primarily studied what we can infer if the observational data extends spatially to @xmath126 .",
    "about 1/3 of galaxies from manga will have data to such extent , but the rest will have data only to @xmath206 .",
    "it may be more difficult to infer the @xmath2 accurately using such data .",
    "observationally it may be useful to obtain ancillary data at larger radii , for example , using long - slit data or globular clusters @xcite .",
    "our study showed that high - resolution imaging helps to alleviate the stellar mass and dark matter degeneracy for nearby galaxies .",
    "images captured under good seeing conditions will be very useful for reducing the degeneracy . in this respect ,",
    "stellar population modelling may also help to ( partially ) lift the degeneracy .",
    "in the jam method , we only used the second order moments of the velocity distribution . in principle , with data from ifu surveys such as manga , higher - order moments ( in the form of the gauss - hermite coefficients @xmath207 and @xmath208 ) will be available as well .",
    "orbit - based or particle - based modelling techniques , such as the schwarzschild and the made - to - measure ( m2 m ) methods , can readily utilise such information to refine mass models",
    ". it will be interesting to perform a study where different methods ( jam , m2 m and schwarzschild s method , action - based distribution functions ) are compared with each other to identify their strengths , weaknesses and complementarity",
    ". the computational requirements of methods other than jam may however limit the extent to which such a comparison is achievable .",
