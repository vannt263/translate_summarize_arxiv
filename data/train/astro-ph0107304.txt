    "the errors listed in table  5 address only random errors : they represent the quadratic addition of the standard error in abundance ( the error in the mean abundance ) derived from individual liness.d.@xmath1/@xmath26 , where @xmath0s.d.@xmath1 is the mean standard deviation over all elements for the star and n is the number of lines for the species in question . ] and errors resulting from atmospheric parameter uncertainties @xmath25t@xmath27 = 100  k , @xmath25log  @xmath28 = 0.3 , and @xmath29 = 0.25 km s@xmath19 , which we believe to be appropriate for the present investigation .",
    "systematic errors are more difficult to assess .",
    "we have discussed elsewhere ( ryan et al . 1999 ) differences that arise between alternative plausible choices of effective temperature scales .",
    "for example , alonso , arribas , & martinez - roger ( 1996 ) have determined temperatures using the infrared flux method ( irfm ) that are generally higher than those from _ bvri _ colors and model atmospheres . in order to quantify the effect , we assessed the impact on our analysis had we adopted irfm - related temperatures . due to the @xmath61000  k difference between cd24@xmath217504 and the giants , we address these two groupings separately .    the turnoff / subgiant star cd24@xmath217504 has an irfm t@xmath30  k ( alonso , private communication to primas et al .",

    "for the four giants of the present study , irfm temperatures are unavailable , but it is possible to transform the bvri colors to the irfm scale using the color - metallicity - temperature calibrations provided by alonso , arribas , & martinez - roger ( 1999 ) . using the johnson - cousins photometry from our table  4 , cousins - to - johnson transformations from bessell ( 1979 ) , and johnson - to - irfm calibration equations from alonso et al .",

    "the entries based on @xmath37 and @xmath38 are flagged as uncertain because the calibrations show greater sensitivity to metallicity between [ fe / h ] = 3 and [ fe / h ] = 2 than they do between [ fe / h ] = 2 and [ fe / h ] = 1 , which is unlikely to be correct ; see alonso et al .",

    "our results agree well with those of fulbright ( 1999 , chapter 6 ) in the abundance ranges he considered , and we refer the reader to his discussion of the dispersions . in brief summary , concerning elements in common between the two works , he concluded from the data set he assembled that the scatter in mg , al , si is probably real , while for ca , v , cr , ni , and ba the spread was not larger than might be expected from the observational errors alone . in table  8",
    "one sees almost invariably that the value of @xmath58 is indeed larger in the lowest abundance bin than in higher abundance ones .",
    "the question then arises : does the abundance spread increase significantly at lowest abundance ? if one excludes si ( poor data ) , and sr and ba ( clear large abundance spreads ) and considers the nine remaining elements in table  8 in the range [ fe / h ] @xmath9 2.5 , one finds @xmath0@xmath58@xmath1 = 0.19 , which may be compared with the mean observational error from table  5 of 0.14 . given , however , that the sample we used to determine @xmath58 is derived from a large compilation of data with various figures of merit and analyzed by different workers , the latter value is probably an underestimate of the appropriate observational error .",
    "it would thus be premature to conclude that for [ fe / h ] @xmath9 2.5 the observed scatter exceeds the observational errors . that said , we also note that the scale estimates for stars in the lowest abundance bins are indeed significantly higher than those in the highest abundance bins when compared with the estimated bootstrap errors on the scale .",

    "it should be resolved with a much larger and homogeneous data set , both to improve the quality of the data and to understand the role of unusual stars such as cs  22949037 .",

    "unexplained trends include the behavior of c , n , cr , mn , co , and the heavy neutron - capture elements , together with the apparent fe - peak - element deficiency of cs  22949037 . to obtain further insight into the problem we consider relative abundances as a function of atomic number .",

    "one sees that c , mg , al , si , and ca all lie above zero as in cs  22949037 , but the comparison is barely suggestive of the existence of the phenomenon and hardly compelling , given measurement errors of order 0.15 dex .",
    "an ordinary runs test ( see , e.g. , gibbons 1985 ) can be used to attach estimates of the statistical significance to the impressions described above . in the ordered sequence of increasing atomic number ,",

    "we sought to address this question in terms of the low abundance models of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "given that the predicted production of the iron - peak elements is critically sensitive to the assumed ejection energy and mass cut of the model , together with the overdeficiency of fe in cs  22949037 , we chose to normalize relative abundances to magnesium for both observation and theory .",
    "we were particularly interested to determine the sensitivity of model predictions to initial abundances , stellar mass , and assumed ejection energy .",
    "we summarize our conclusions as follows .",
    "( 1 ) there is essentially no difference in the relative abundances of the predictions for high - mass models having heavy element abundances z = 0 and z = 10@xmath59 , which simplifies interpretation in terms of population ii or putative population iii ( z = 0 , by definition here ) objects .",
    "( 2 ) in the range 3040 m@xmath21 , for models having ejection energies sufficiently high that iron was ejected , the predicted relative abundances are essentially identical .",

    "( 3 ) the models are extremely sensitive to assumed ejection energy .    figure  12 compares the element mass fractions in cs  22949037 relative to that of mg with the mean value for the other four stars observed here , as a function of atomic species . the predictions of models z35b and z35c of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) are also shown . ( the ordinate is the logarithmic mass fraction relative to that of mg . )",
    "model z35c has sufficient energy to eject significant amounts of fe , while z35b does not .",
    "the important point of this figure is that the difference between the data for cs  22949037 and the average of the four  normal \" stars is considerably smaller than that between z35b and z35c .",
    "it seems therefore incorrect to suggest that the abundance patterns of cs  22949037 are representative of the undiluted ejecta of a supernova _ like z35b_. given the great sensitivity to energy , it would be interesting to know whether any models with explosive energies intermediate to cases b and c reproduce the observations .",
    "if one contrives , however , to represent the abundance patterns of cs  22949037 in terms of the hypothesis that it formed from an admixture of the ejecta of a z35b - like object with an interstellar medium similar to that from which the other stars of the sample formed , the extra assumption leads to considerably better agreement .",
    "table  9 compares the production factors of z35b of woosley and weaver ( 1995 , their table  17b ) with those of the excess mass fractions of the elements in cs  22949037 above the corresponding average values in the other four stars by 0.16 dex , which brings its value of [ fe / h ] into line with that of cs  22949037 . ] , normalized to the mg production factor ( 3.34 ) of z35b .",
    "the agreement is far from perfect , with si through ti being poorly - explained .",
    "given , however , the approximate nature of the modeling the hypotheses is not preposterous , and deserves closer consideration .",
    "one of the unexplained features of the present results , and indeed of studies of extremely metal - poor stars in general , is the high incidence of supersolar [ c / fe ] values . add to this the supersolar value of [ n / fe ] in cs  22949037 .",
    "these features are not predicted by canonical supernovae and gce models ( timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) , which predict that [ c / fe ] will have roughly the solar value and that [ n / fe ] should be subsolar ( since n is produced in a secondary manner ) . while one can suggest _ ad hoc _ explanations yielding supersolar n involving rotation ( e.g. maeder 1997 ) and convective overshoot or supermixing ( e.g. timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) , there exists a class of models which actually predicted the possibility of supersolar c and n abundances , together with under - production of the iron - peak group .",
    "these are the hypernovae ( massive pair - instability supernovae ) discussed by woosley & weaver ( 1982 ) . while these authors emphasize the simplifying assumptions in their models ( for example the neglect of possible mass loss ) the results for their 500 m@xmath21 , zero - heavy - element hypernova is of particular interest .",
    "this object evolves to produce large amounts of primary nitrogen by proton capture on dredged - up carbon , while no fe will be produced since ",
    "the carbon - oxygen core itself will certainly become a black hole . \" as noted by carr , bond , & arnett ( 1984 ) , the essential feature of these very massive objects is their potential to  pass carbon and oxygen from the helium - burning core through the hydrogen - burning shell , in such a way that it is cno processed to nitrogen before entering the hydrogen envelope . \"",
    "the more recent computations of heger & woosley ( 2000 , reported by fryer , woosley , & heger 2000 ) find large primary nitrogen production in rotating 250 and 300 m@xmath21 , z = 0 hypernovae .",
    "magnesium enhancement is also reported .",
    "although the oxygen abundance of cs  22949037 is unknown , it is likely that this object contains more nitrogen than all other metals combined . given the unexplained abundance results discussed here ( not to mention the existence of the very poorly - understood object cs  22957027 noted above ( [ fe / h ] = 3.38 , [ c / fe ] = + 2.2 , [ n / fe ] = 2.0 , but `` normal '' heavy neutron - capture element abundance ; see norris et al .",
    "1997b ) , systematic theoretical investigations of hypernovae and their incorporation into models of early galactic chemical enrichment might well prove fruitful .",
    "we have obtained high - resolution ( r = 42000 ) , high - signal - to - noise ( @xmath0s / n@xmath1 = 85 ) spectra for five stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 3.5 , but otherwise chosen by selection criteria blind to relative abundance peculiarities .",
    "the data were analyzed with lte 1d model - atmosphere techniques to determine chemical abundances ( or limits ) for some 18 elements . for atomic species ,",
    "the accuracy of the line - strength measurements , @xmath6 510 m , the uncertainties in atmospheric parameters , and the relatively small numbers of lines available combine to yield a median relative abundance error of 0.15 dex .",
    "the mean abundance of the group is @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 = 3.68 ( with @xmath60}$ ] = 0.23 ) , which permits one to investigate abundance trends and spreads at lowest abundance .",
    "cd38@xmath2245 , discovered some two decades ago ( bessell & norris 1984 ) , with a newly determined metallicity of [ fe / h ] = 3.98 , remains the most metal - deficient object currently known despite comprehensive searches throughout the intervening period .    for most of the elements ,",
    "the relative abundances of the sample show little spread , and hence yield lowest abundance anchor points for relative abundance trends .",
    "the remarkable exception to this general behavior is cs  22949037 , which has [ fe / h ] = 3.79 .",
    "we confirm the result of mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995b ) that [ c / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] , and [ si / fe ] all have values @xmath6  1.0 , and stand well above those observed in other stars at this metallicity . in this star ,",
    "we also find [ n / fe ] = 2.7 . for cs  22949037 ,",
    "the abundance patterns are suggestive of enrichment scenarios involving partial ejection of supernova mantles ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) and/or massive ( 200500 m@xmath8 ) zero - heavy - element hypernovae ( e.g. woosley & weaver 1982 ) .",
    "the other exceptions are the behavior of carbon ( figure 4 ) and strontium ( but not barium ) ( figure 9 ) , which show large spreads at lowest abundances .",
    "the large range in carbon for [ fe / h ] @xmath9 3.0 is suggestive of the need for non - canonical enrichment sources ( e.g. hypernovae ) .",
    "an explanation of the contrast in the [ sr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] spreads may require the operation of more than one process for the production of the heavy neutron - capture elements in massive stars ( blake et al .",
    "2001 ; ryan et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "if one removes cs  22949037 from the discussion , there is no strong upward trend in [ @xmath5/fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] ( figure 5 ) , in contradistinction to some reports of the behavior of [ o / fe ] .",
    "it remains to be seen whether models of galactic chemical enrichment can be produced which will reconcile such different behavior . to our knowledge ,",
    "none exist at the present time .",
    "the analysis of aluminum lines requires inclusion of non - lte effects ( baumller & gehren 1997 ) .",
    "when approximate correction is made to the present lte results we find that the behavior of [ al / mg ] versus [ fe / h ] is in reasonable accord with the gce models of timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "we confirm the strong and unexpected behavior of the iron - peak abundance trends of [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , and [ co / fe ] for [ fe / h ] @xmath9 3.0 reported by mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995b ) and ryan et al .",
    "in contrast , there is no trend for [ ni / fe ] : at [ fe / h ] @xmath6 3.7 , [ ni / fe ] = + 0.08 @xmath7 0.06 .",
    "this appears to be inconsistent with supernova models of nakamura et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that explain the observed behavior of the other fe - peak elements by varying the position of the model mass cut relative to the si - burning regions .",
    "finally , there is suggestive evidence that the spread in abundance increases with decreasing abundance for essentially all of the elements considered in the present study .",
    "the reality of this effect requires re - investigation with high - quality data of a larger sample of objects than is currently available .",

    "<S> high - resolution , high - signal - to - noise ( @xmath0s / n@xmath1 = 85 ) spectra have been obtained for five stars  cd24@xmath217504 , cd38@xmath3245 , cs  22172002 , cs  22885096 , and cs  22949037  having [ fe / h ] @xmath4 3.5 according to previous lower s / n material . </S>",
    "<S> lte model - atmosphere techniques are used to determine [ fe / h ] and relative abundances , or their limits , for some 18 elements , and to constrain more tightly the early enrichment history of the galaxy than is possible based on previous analyses .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with high - quality higher - abundance literature data for other metal - poor stars and with the canonical galactic chemical enrichment results of timmes et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1995 ) and obtain the following basic results : ( 1 ) large supersolar values of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] , not predicted by the canonical models , exist at lowest abundance . for c at least , </S>",
    "<S> the result is difficult to attribute to internal mixing effects ; ( 2 ) we confirm that there is _ no upward trend _ in [ @xmath5/fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] , in contradistinction to some reports of the behavior of [ o / fe ] ; ( 3 ) the abundances of aluminum , after correction for non - lte effects , are in fair accord with theoretical prediction ; ( 4 ) we confirm earlier results concerning the fe - peak elements that [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] decrease at lowest abundance , while [ co / fe ] increases  behaviors that had not been predicted . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that [ ni / fe ] does not vary with [ fe / h ] , and at [ fe / h ] @xmath6 3.7 , [ ni / fe ] = + 0.08 @xmath7 0.06 . </S>",
    "<S> this result appears to be inconsistent with the supernova models of nakamura et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1999 ) that seek to understand the observed behavior of the fe - peak elements by varying the position of the model mass cut relative to the si - burning regions . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) the heavy neutron - capture elements sr and ba exhibit a large scatter , with the effect being larger for sr than ba . </S>",
    "<S> the disparate behavior of these two elements has been attributed to the existence of ( at least ) two different mechanisms for their production ; ( 6 ) for the remarkable object cs  22949037 , we confirm the result of mcwilliam et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1995b ) that [ c / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] , and [ si / fe ] are supersolar by @xmath6 1.0 dex . </S>",
    "<S> further , we find [ n / fe ] = 2.7 @xmath7 0.4 . </S>",
    "<S> none of these results is understandable within the framework of standard models . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss them in terms of partial ejection of supernova mantles ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) and massive ( 200500 m@xmath8 ) zero - heavy - element hypernovae ( e.g. woosley & weaver 1982 ) . the latter model actually predicted overproduction of n and underproduction of fe - peak elements ; and ( 7 ) we use robust techniques to determine abundance trends as a function of [ fe / h ] . in most cases </S>",
    "<S> one sees an apparent upturn in the dispersion of relative abundance [ x / fe ] for [ fe / h ] @xmath9 2.5 . </S>",
    "<S> it remains unclear whether this is a real effect , or one driven by observational error . </S>",
    "<S> the question needs to be resolved with a much larger and homogeneous data set , both to improve the quality of the data and to understand the role of unusual stars such as cs  22949037 .    </S>",
    "<S> five stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 3.5 </S>"
