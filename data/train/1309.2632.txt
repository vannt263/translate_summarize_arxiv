    "these two intermediate cases , despite employing different heat factors , show remarkably similar average shock radius histories . in the case of the successful explosion , n5m2 @xmath81.02 ,",
    "the average shock radius remains extremely similar to the comparable unperturbed model , n0m0 @xmath81.02 , until about 100 ms after bounce .",
    "the average shock radius of n5m2 @xmath81.02 remains relatively constant just below 200 km until @xmath26 ms at which point the shock begins to expand rapidly , signaling the onset of explosion .",
    "the second panel of fig .  [ fig : rshock ] shows a measure of the overall shock asymmetry , the normalized standard deviation of the shock radius @xmath27 .",
    "the shock asymmetry grows as n5m2 @xmath81.02 experiences runaway shock expansion , indicating that the explosion is aspherical , as is also clear from the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : volrend ] .",
    "the failed explosions show comparatively small values of @xmath27 , implying relative sphericity of the shock surface , until strong sasi oscillations set in after the shock has receded ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of pre - shock perturbations has substantial impact on the neutrino heating efficiency , @xmath28 . as shown in the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rshock ] , for n5m2 @xmath81.00 , the heating efficiency history is very similar to that of n0m0 @xmath81.02 .",
    "this implies that the perturbations drive nonradial motion that increases the dwell time of material in the gain region , significantly enhancing the fraction of neutrino luminosity absorbed . for n5m2 @xmath81.02 , the combination of @xmath8@xmath9 _ and _ pre - shock perturbations results in a sufficiently increased heating efficiency to initiate a neutrino - driven explosion",
    "also , @xmath29 depends sensitively , and non - linearly , on @xmath8 .",
    "the time - averaged heating efficiencies for simulations n0m0 @xmath81.00 , n0m0 @xmath81.02 , n5m2 @xmath81.00 , and n5m2 @xmath81.02 are 0.062 , 0.080 , 0.075 , and 0.100 , respectively .",
    "it is almost exactly at the positive inflection in the average shock radius curve of n5m2 @xmath81.02 ( @xmath30 ms ) that the critical condition for explosion , @xmath31 is satisfied ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rshock ] ; ) . here",
    "we define the average advection time through the gain region as @xmath32 and the gain region heating time as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the total specific energy of the gain region and @xmath35 is the net neutrino heating in the gain region . during the stalled - shock phase of n5m2 @xmath81.02 , around @xmath36 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath37 is growing continuously .",
    "once this critical ratio exceeds unity , thermal energy builds up in the gain region faster than it can be advected out into the cooling layer and the shock begins to expand .    in order to assess the magnitude of the perturbations as they are actually impinging upon the shock , and their effect on the turbulent postbounce flow , we compute the density - weighted radial averages of the mach number of anisotropic motion , @xmath38 where the sound speed is first angle - averaged and the velocity of anisotropic motion has the same definition as in @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic mach numbers for the gain layer and for the preshock radial interval @xmath39 km are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : maniso ] . the differences between @xmath40 for perturbed and unperturbed cases are evident .",
    "the unperturbed cases , n0m0 @xmath81.00 and n0m0 @xmath81.02 , have @xmath41 , whereas in the perturbed models we find peak values of @xmath40 of @xmath420.02 .",
    "the mach number of the perturbations is dramatically reduced by the compression resulting from infall toward the shock .",
    "larger pre - shock values of @xmath43 correlate with larger post - shock values of @xmath44",
    ". the perturbed models for both low and high heat factors show similarly large values of @xmath45 until @xmath46 ms when n5m2 @xmath81.02 begins to explode .",
    "the unperturbed models have lower values of @xmath45 than either perturbed model . the mach number of anisotropic motion for n0m0 @xmath81.02 overtakes that of n5m2 @xmath81.00 around 220 ms , which we attribute to stronger neutrino - driven convection .",
    "another useful metric of the character of the disturbances reaching the shock is the power spectrum of the perturbations , which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pertspec ] .",
    "we define the power spectrum of the perturbations to a scalar field @xmath47 as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{eq : pell}\\ ] ] the spherical harmonics , @xmath50 , have their usual definition , and details of similar calculations may be found in , e.g. , .",
    "figure [ fig : pertspec ] shows the perturbations for tangential velocity , @xmath51 , and density , where we have set @xmath47 to the square root of these quantities so @xmath52 has units of velocity and density , respectively .",
    "we normalize @xmath53 by the angle - averaged radial velocity and density at 400 km , respectively .",
    "the applied perturbations to @xmath13 manifest themselves in peak values of @xmath54 of @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "nonradial motion caused by the initial perturbations results in the growth of density contrasts during infall @xcite .",
    "the peak values of @xmath57 correspond to density contrasts reaching the shock front of @xmath58 .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pertspec ] is a powerful diagnostic of the strength of convective and turbulent motions in the gain region , the spectrum of anisotropic kinetic energy , @xmath59 .",
    "it is computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pell ] ) with @xmath60}$ ] . model n5m2 @xmath81.02 has _",
    "significantly _ more anisotropic kinetic energy at large scales than the unperturbed simulation , n0m0 @xmath81.02 . above @xmath61 ,",
    "the spectra of the perturbed and unperturbed cases become fairly similar .",
    "the more dramatic difference at small @xmath62 corresponds to the spatial scales of the perturbations that are reaching the shock , as measured by @xmath63 .",
    "kinetic energy on large scales has been noted to correlate with conditions favorable for explosion in a number of previous studies .    in summary , the message of the various analyses we present in figs .",
    "[ fig : rshock][fig : pertspec ] is clear : models with perturbations develop more vigorous postbounce turbulence , have higher neutrino heating efficiencies , and either explode or are much closer to explosion than their unperturbed counterparts .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy that the perturbations boost model n5m2 @xmath81.00 to essentially the same heating efficiency and shock radius evolution as the unperturbed , more strongly heated model n0m0 @xmath81.02 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite and first demonstrated by @xcite , the development and strength of neutrino - driven convection in the gain layer increases with increasing magnitude of the accreting seed perturbations .",
    "stronger nonradial motion increases the dwell time of material in the gain layer .",
    "thus , our models with perturbations absorb neutrino energy more efficiently , which favors explosion .",
    "the final phase of nuclear burning in massive stars approaching core collapse is fast and furious .",
    "the si / o shells surrounding the iron core are sites of large - scale deviations of turbulent flow from spherical symmetry .",
    "our 3d postbounce ccsn simulations show that aspherical perturbations in the si / o layer can have important effects on the 3d hydrodynamics of ccsne .",
    "they lead to more vigorous turbulent flow behind the shock and _ qualitatively _ alter the outcome of core collapse : they can turn a dud into an explosion .    the nonradial momentum - preserving velocity perturbations that we considered here have spatial frequency and mach numbers comparable to what is expected from 2d si / o burning simulations .",
    "these perturbations are mild compared to the large @xmath64 density variations imposed by the previous studies of @xcite and @xcite .    our simulations",
    "_ prove the principle _ that nonradial velocity perturbations from convective si / o burning can alter postbounce ccsn hydrodynamics and can affect the explosion mechanism .",
    "we study the effect of only one particular perturbation , however , it is likely that the outcome will depend on both magnitude and spatial dependence of the perturbations .",
    "this must be explored in future work .",
    "the 3d oxygen burning simulations of @xcite suggest that in 3d the mach numbers of fluctuations may be only half as large as in 2d .",
    "however , @xcite included only the o shell in 3d and @xcite argue that it is the interplay of si and o burning shells that drives the most violent fluctuations .",
    "thus , we feel that our mach 0.2 perturbations in the si / o layer in 3d are _",
    "plausible_.    recent studies comparing 2d and 3d ccsn hydrodynamics suggest that explosions are more readily obtained in 2d than in 3d ( , but see @xcite for a differing view ) .",
    "ccsn theory , however , must robustly produce and explain explosions in 3d to match observations",
    ". there are efforts underway by many groups to improve upon current 3d simulations in treatments of neutrino transport , weak interaction physics , magnetic fields , and gravity with the hope of robustly producing explosions in 3d .",
    "our work shows that the initial conditions also matter , reminding us that the ccsn mechanism is essentially an initial value problem .",
    "at least part of the solution to the long - standing supernova problem must lie in multi - d progenitor structure .",
