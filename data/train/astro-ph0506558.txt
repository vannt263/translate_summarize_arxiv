    "the recent improvement in the determination of cosmological observables by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite and other large - scale structure experiments has given a boost to the search for viable theoretical scenarios of the early universe .",
    "an important problem cosmologists still have to address is cosmic confusion in inflationary scenarios , whereby different underlying physics leads to the same observables ; deriving robust conclusions from data requires an understanding of such model degeneracies .",
    "viable inflation models must predict the quasi - invariant density perturbation spectra and subdominant tensor perturbations that observations require , but having done so it is then difficult to discriminate between different details such as the precise shape of the potential . indeed , even quite radical revisions of understanding of high - energy physics , such as the braneworld scenario , have yet to lead to appreciably characteristic predictions , at least in the simplest cases ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some reviews ) .    rather than choosing a particular class of potentials and calculating the preferred values in the parameter space , one can try to circumscribe the allowed regions within it through the general behaviour of the inflationary dynamics .",
    "this can be achieved , for instance , by the study of the consistency equations , which do not depend on the choice of the potential ; see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "another possibility is to consider the evolution of the so - called flow parameters in terms of the number of @xmath0-foldings @xcite .",
    "the flow equations naturally select a subset in the observational plane defined by the scalar spectral index @xmath1 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 .",
    "modifications to the underlying dynamics will lead to a shift in the location of that subset , helping to indicate whether a particular class of inflationary models is better able to produce observables in the region required by data .    in this paper",
    "we shall explore the flow approach in several braneworld scenarios , where the effective friedmann equation governing the cosmological brane dynamics is modified with respect to the 4d evolution .",
    "the simplest such case , the randall  sundrum ( rs ) type ii model for a normal scalar field , was already considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and found not to introduce qualitatively different features .",
    "here we shall extend the discussion to the gauss  bonnet ( gb ) braneworld by means of the `` patch formalism '' @xcite , which provides a unified description of a wide range of possible gravity models .",
    "this has the advantage that we can simultaneously implement general inflationary scenarios with modified friedmann equations and either an ordinary or dirac  born  infeld ( dbi ) tachyonic scalar field .",
    "the goal is to seek new insights into the general structure of braneworld and tachyon scenarios via a technique that might give complementary information as compared to model - building approaches .",
    "we will find that in the gauss  bonnet case with normal scalar field , the flow structure in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane is quite different from the 4d and rs cases because of the details of the flow equations .",
    "the flow structure for the tachyon models , here presented for the first time , gives independent support to other results found in literature ; in particular , the most characteristic prediction is the generation of spectra with a rather low tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "the stability of the fixed points in the plane is also analyzed at higher order in the flow parameters .",
    "finally , we shall consider how the general relativistic and braneworld scenarios are affected by the introduction of a noncommutative space - time algebra , which modifies the inflationary anisotropies while leaving the homogeneous background ( and the associated flow equations ) untouched @xcite .",
    "this skews the theoretical points in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane towards the blue - tilted region , with models having a high tensor - to - scalar ratio suffering the largest shifts .",
    "we shall assume that the universe is confined into a 3-brane embedded in a five - dimensional bulk .",
    "matter lives on the brane only , while gravitons are free to propagate in the bulk .",
    "this is guaranteed as long as the effective energy density measured by the observer is smaller than the mass scale of the theory , @xmath3 . by restricting our attention to the inflationary physics , we can disregard the contribution of the projected weyl tensor at large scales .",
    "if the energy density on the brane is comparable to the potential energy adopted to stabilize the extra dimension , the bulk backreacts and the effective cosmological evolution is modified by nonstandard terms .",
    "in particular , we can describe the primordial universe , at least in some finite time interval or energy patch , by the friedmann equation [ frw ] h^2=_q^2^q , where @xmath4 is constant and @xmath5 is a constant factor with energy dimension @xmath6= e^{1 - 2q}$ ] .",
    "this equation encodes a number of situations , including the pure 4d radion - stabilized regime ( @xmath7 , also known as the standard cosmology ) , the high - energy limit of the randall  sundrum braneworld ( @xmath8 ) , and the high - energy limit of the gauss  bonnet scenario ( @xmath9 ) . defining the parameter 2(1-q^-1 ) ,",
    "( [ frw ] ) can be recast as h^2-=_q^2- .",
    "deviations from the 4d case @xmath10 will characterize exotic scenarios ( braneworlds or modified gravities ) according to their magnitude and sign .    because of local conservation of the energy  momentum tensor , for a perfect fluid with pressure",
    "@xmath11 the continuity equation is [ conti ] + 3h(+p)=0 .",
    "the dynamics of the patch inflationary universe has been extensively explored in the case of both an ordinary scalar inflaton @xmath12 and a dbi tachyon @xmath13 ; for a complete review of results and a list of references see ref .",
    "it is useful to generically label the inflaton field as @xmath14 and introduce a new parameter [ tilth ] & = & + & = & 2 let @xmath15 be the hubble parameter evaluated at some reference time @xmath16 ( later it will correspond to the integration starting time ) .",

    "the amount of inflation is described by the number of @xmath0-foldings [ ndef ] n(t ) ( a_f / a ) = _ t^t_fh(t)dt , this `` backward '' definition measuring the number of remaining @xmath0-foldings at the time @xmath24 before the end of inflation at @xmath25 . in the flow approach ,",
    "the cosmological variables during inflation are written as functions of @xmath26 or @xmath14 ; one can shift from one picture to the other via [ npsi ] = -=()^ , where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "we define the flow parameters as [ flow ] _ 0 & & + & = & ( ) ^=()^ ( ) ^2,[hsrb ] + _ & & ( ) ^ , 1.[flow2 ] where @xmath27 indicates the @xmath28-th @xmath14 derivative . usually in literature they are dubbed @xmath29 .",

    "@xcite , the flow parameters and equations do not encode the inflationary dynamics , since they are only a set of identities for the hubble rate @xmath34 as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , by definition the next - to - lowest - order sr terms appear with higher powers , and one can approximate the dynamics through a power truncation of the traditional sr tower .",

    "therefore the power - law fixed points in gb @xmath12-inflation are a repellor in both backward and forward integration .    in other cases of interest a full analysis",
    "is required ; moreover , one should check the stability in both backward and forward time integration and along a `` sufficient '' number of directions in the parameter space .",
    "if all the eigenvalues have the same sign , then there is an attractor either in the past or in the future .",
    "conversely , if some of them have relative opposite sign , there is no attractor .",
    "the truncation order is also important , since higher - order terms can change the sign of the eigenvalues .    to determine the minimum level at which the stability analysis is reliable , we have solved the jordan equation at the power - law fixed points from first order ( @xmath57 matrix ) to @xmath58 order in the flow parameters ( @xmath59 ) , and checked that the real parts of the eigenvalues have different signs at higher orders .",

    "as regards the level of approximation , for the normal scalar field and the 4d tachyon the first order is already sufficient to give the result holding at all higher orders , while in the rs and gb tachyon cases all eigenvalues are negative up to @xmath64 and @xmath65 order , respectively . at higher orders one",

    "note that the degeneracy of one of the eigenvalues ( the lowest one in the rs @xmath12 and gb @xmath13 cases ) is lifted every two orders ( at even orders in the cited example ) .",
    "the integration of the flow equations , performed at @xmath66 order ( see below ) , confirms these results .",
    "therefore one can conclude that the power - law fixed points are unstable in both time directions , for all the present cosmological models , and at any ( high ) order in the flow truncation .",
    "the latter has been shown to be consistent in all cases from @xmath67 order on .",
    "in order to study the evolution of the flow parameters , we have to establish a truncation level for the flow hierarchy and set suitable ranges of initial conditions for the parameters themselves within which they are randomly selected .",

    "we divide our results into the ( standard ) commutative case and the noncommutative case . in the latter",
    "the flow equation evolution is unchanged , but the expression for the spectral index eq .",
    "( [ observ ] ) is altered .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the flow points in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane for an ordinary and a tachyonic scalar field in the 4d , rs , and gb scenarios .",
    "the classification of points is model dependent and summarized in table  [ table1 ] . in all cases the attractor points are the dominant class , and hence the blue - tilted region ( @xmath79 ) is more populated than the red - tilted one .",

    "the percentages are quite small , indicating that observations have already chopped off a substantial part of inflationary model space .",
    "bearing in mind that the majority of the points are late - time attractor points with @xmath80 and negligible @xmath2 , the strong constraint @xmath81 at @xmath82 @xcite plays a major role in ensuring the percentages are so small . if this limit were further strengthened in the future to exclude blue - tilted models , all those points would be lost .",
    "there are a couple of trends evident in the numbers .",
    "firstly , the tachyon cases tend to give higher percentages , due to their suppression of the tensor ratio @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , for the normal scalar field , increasing the noncommutativity parameter @xmath83 increases the percentages as it skews the swathes across to where the observations lie .",
    "nevertheless , every cosmology proves capable of generating models within the allowed region , which prevents any useful conclusions from being drawn .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed braneworld and tachyon scenarios in terms of the flow evolution equations .",
    "the equations of motion and the stability of the associated fixed points have been considered in detail in the general relativistic , randall  sundrum , and gauss  bonnet cases at high order in the flow parameters .",
    "each model generates different predictions for the main cosmological observables ( scalar spectral index @xmath84 and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 ) .",
    "in particular , gauss  bonnet gravity deeply modifies the flow structure in the parameter space for an ordinary inflaton field . in the cosmological tachyon case ,",
    "the theoretical points in the @xmath84@xmath2 plane are pressed towards scale invariance but the characteristic flow swathe does not lose coherence .",
    "we also discussed the imprint of a noncommutative geometry on the inflationary observables .",
    "some trends remain to be explored . in the braneworld inflationary scenarios the weyl tensor is negligible at large scales and we have consistently neglected its contribution to the observables @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    ". however , at small scales it can play an important role , as well as in the determination of other observables such as the bispectrum even at long wavelengths .",
    "although we expect the flow approach to be unmodified by bulk physics , further investigation might clarify this point .",
    "the flow equations approach is only one possible way in which one can generate an ensemble of inflationary models , corresponding to a taylor expansion of @xmath38 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , other methods were implemented in the general relativistic case to study the robustness of the flow equations structure , showing that there are significant variations in outcome between methods .",
    "it may be interesting to explore these differences in the braneworld and tachyon cases , too .",
