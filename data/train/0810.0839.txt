    "the langvin model is a very important model to describe the diffusion behavior in non - equilibrium systems , and it has been widely applied to various phenomena in physics , chemistry and biology .",

    "exact analytical solutions of the fpe are known for only a few cases . in most cases ,",
    "approximate solutions are obtained by using analytic or numerical methods .",
    "typical analytic methods are an appropriate change of variables , eigenfunction expansion , perturbation expansion , path integral , green s function , moment method , and the continued - fraction method @xcite . when no analytic solutions are available , numerical methods such as finite - difference and finite - element methods have been employed .    for some langevin models subjected to additive noise only , exact solutions have been obtained . for the linear langevin model ,",
    "the exact dynamical solution is expressed by the gaussian distribution with time - dependent mean and variance of a state variable .",

    "the generalized fpes in which time dependences are introduced in drift and diffusion terms have been investigated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "when multiplicative noise is incorporated to the langevin model , the problem becomes much difficult @xcite .",
    "for the linear langevin model subjected to additive and multiplicative noise , the exact stationary solution is available , and it has been considerably discussed in connection with the non - gaussian pdf in the nonextensive statistics @xcite-@xcite . an exact dynamical solution for the linear langevin model subjected to multiplicative noise only is obtained in ref . @xcite",

    "approximate dynamical solutions of the linear and nonlinear fpes subjected to multiplicative noise have been discussed with some sophisticated methods such as the polynomial expansion of the logarithmic pdf @xcite , the linearizing transformation @xcite and the direct quadrature method for moment solution @xcite .",

    "a typical example is a calculation of the time - dependent fisher information which is expressed by the derivatives of the dynamical pdf with respect to its parameters . in a recent paper @xcite , we calculated the fisher information in a typical nonextensive system described by the linear langevin model subjected to additive and multiplicative noise .",
    "we developed an analytic dynamical approach to the fpe combined with the @xmath0-moment method in which moments are evaluated over the escort probability distribution @xcite .",

    "these are inherent in the moment approximation in which each moment is required to be small . despite these disadvantages , however , our moment method has following advantages : ( i ) obtained dynamical solutions are compatible with the exact stationary solutions in the langevin models a , b and c , ( ii ) it is useful for various subjects in which analytical dynamical pdfs are indispensable ( _ e.g. , _ ref .",
