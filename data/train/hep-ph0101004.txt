    "gluon distribution plays a central role in calculating many important signatures at hadron colliders because of the dominance of gluon initiated subprocesses .",
    "a precise knowledge of the gluon distribution is absolutely vital for reliable predictions for signal as well as background cross sections @xcite .",
    "a great effort has been devoted to find good physical observables for extracting information on gluon distribution @xcite .    for many years ,",
    "prompt photon production has been thought as a clean signal for information on gluon distribution because its cross section at lowest order is dominated by the `` compton '' subprocess : @xmath4 , and this dominance is preserved at higher orders @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical and experimental complications have limited our ability to extract clean information on gluon distribution from the direct photon data @xcite . at collider energies , prompt photons",
    "are observed and their cross sections are measured only if the photons are relatively isolated in phase space .",
    "isolation is required to reduce various hadronic backgrounds .",
    "but at the same time , the cross section is no longer totally inclusive and theoretical predictions become sensitive to the isolation parameters @xcite . in addition , phenomenological fragmentation functions are needed for including photons emerged from the long - distance fragmentation of quarks and gluons that are themselves produced at short - distance @xcite .",
    "our knowledge on phenomenological fragmentation functions and the theoretical uncertainties associated with the isolation prevent fully quantitative determinations of gluon distribution from the collider data on isolated photons .",
    "although data at fixed target energies provide good information on gluon distribution at large @xmath5 @xcite , the controversy about how much @xmath6-smearing is required to understand the data introduces the significant uncertainties to the gluon distributions @xcite . as a result",
    ", all direct photon data were excluded from recent cteq global analyses of parton distributions @xcite .",
    "recently , berger , gordon , and klasen ( bgk ) show that drell - yan transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distributions in hadronic collisions are dominated by partonic subprocesses initiated by incident gluons if @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the invariant mass of the produced lepton pairs @xcite .",
    "bgk argue that drell - yan @xmath0 distribution is an advantageous source of constraints on the gluon distribution , free from the experimental and theoretical complications of photon isolation that beset studies of prompt photon production .",
    "other than the difference between a virtual and a real photon , drell - yan and prompt photon production share the same partonic subprocesses .",
    "the virtual photon produced in drell - yan process subsequently decays into a pair of leptons .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the cross section at high @xmath0 and low @xmath1 , we ignore the @xmath8 channel contributions in this paper .",
    "if we integrate over angular dependence of the lepton pairs , the drell - yan massive lepton - pair production between hadron @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be expressed in terms of an inclusive production of a virtual photon @xcite @xmath11 because of the advantage of measuring the leptons , drell - yan massive lepton - pair production as well as the inclusive virtual photon production defined in eq .",
    "( [ dy - vph ] ) are entirely inclusive .",
    "the usual factorization theorems in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) should apply @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 run over all parton flavors , the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are parton distributions , and @xmath16 represents both renormalization and factorization scale . in eq .",
    "( [ vph - fac ] ) , @xmath17 are short - distance partonic hard parts and perturbatively calculable to all orders in @xmath18 . similar to prompt photon production , the lowest order `` compton '' subprocess to a virtual photon : @xmath19 dominates the @xmath0 distributions at large @xmath0 as long as the collision energy is high enough to overcome the phase space penalty caused by the virtual photon mass .",
    "therefore , drell - yan @xmath0 distribution at large @xmath0 is an advantageous source of information on the gluon distribution @xcite .    when @xmath20 , the @xmath0 distributions calculated order - by - order in @xmath21 in the conventional fixed - order qcd perturbation theory receive a large logarithm , @xmath22 , at every power of @xmath21 beyond the leading order .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently large @xmath0 and @xmath23 , the convergence of the conventional perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath21 is impaired , and the logarithms must be resummed .",
    "in order to resum the large logarithm , we introduce a concept of virtual photon fragmentation functions @xmath24 for a parton of flavor @xmath25 to fragment into a virtual photon of invariant mass @xmath1 .",
    "normally , a virtual particle state is not physical , and therefore , a fragmentation function to such a state may be gauge dependent and ill - defined .",
    "however , if such a virtual state immediately decays into a _",
    "completely _ measured physical state , we believe that a fragmentation function to such a virtual state is effectively physical . the fragmentation function is experimentally measurable if the decay to the physical state is calculable .    unlike the real photon fragmentation functions @xcite , the virtual photon fragmentation functions are fully perturbative if @xmath26 . in terms of the virtual photon fragmentation functions , the conventional perturbative expansion for @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ vph - fac ] ) can be _ reorganized _ according to a new factorization formula such that the large logarithms are resummed to all orders in @xmath21 .",
    "the detailed derivation of the new factorization formula for the virtual photon production at @xmath28 and the discussions on the all order resummations will be published elsewhere . in this paper , we concentrate on the process independent physics associated with the virtual photon fragmentation functions .    in the next section , we derive the cut - vertex and corresponding operator definitions for virtual photon fragmentation functions . from the definitions ,",

    "we derive the virtual photon fragmentation functions .",
    "we show that the virtual photon fragmentation functions are in principle perturbatively calculable to all orders in @xmath21 if @xmath29 .",
    "because of our ability of measuring the leptons , we can probe the polarization of the virtual photon in drell - yan massive lepton - pair production . therefore , it is also physically meaningful to define fragmentation functions to a virtual photon with a specific polarization . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we derive the evolution equations and the leading order evolution kernels to polarized virtual photon fragmentation functions .    in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we present our numerical results for virtual photon fragmentation functions . by showing the fragmentation functions at different scales ,",
    "we demonstrate the evolution properties of the fragmentation functions for partons to a unpolarized as well as a polarized virtual photon .",
    "we find that fragmentation functions to a longitudinally polarized virtual photon are most important at small @xmath2 , and the fragmentation functions to a transversely polarized virtual photon dominate the large @xmath2 region .",
    "when @xmath0 is large while @xmath23 is fixed , fragmentation functions at large @xmath2 are more relevant for calculating the cross sections .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the virtual photons produced in a unpolarized drell - yan massive lepton - pair production are more likely to be transversely polarized at high @xmath0 .",
    "recent data on j/@xmath3 polarization measured by cdf collaboration at fermilab tevatron seem to be inconsistent with the predictions from various models of j/@xmath3 production @xcite .",
    "the virtual photon production ( extracted from drell - yan massive lepton - pair production ) at large @xmath0 and small @xmath30 has a lot in common with the j/@xmath3 production at high @xmath0 .",
    "they both have two large physical scales : @xmath0 and @xmath30 , which is equal to @xmath31 in the case of j/@xmath3 production ; and @xmath32 is much larger than @xmath30 .",
    "if the collision energy @xmath23 is large enough and the logarithm @xmath22 is so important that the resummed fragmentation contributions dominate the production cross sections , the virtual photon and j/@xmath3 production will share the _ same _ partonic subprocesses . only difference between the virtual photon and j/@xmath3 production at high @xmath0 is the fragmentation functions .",
    "the virtual photon fragmentation functions are completely perturbative , while the parton to j/@xmath3 fragmentation functions involve final - state nonperturbative interactions .",
    "understanding the difference in such final - state interactions is very important for reliable predictions of j/@xmath3 production .",
    "we propose to measure the virtual photon polarization in drell - yan massive lepton - pair production at large @xmath0 and low @xmath30 . because the virtual photon polarizations in drell - yan massive lepton - pair production are completely calculable and independent of the final - state nonperturbative effect , the measurements of the virtual photon polarizations at high @xmath0 provide not only a good test of qcd perturbation theory , but also a reference process to test the models of j/@xmath3 formation .",
    "like other fragmentation functions @xcite , a virtual photon fragmentation function , @xmath24 is defined as a probability density to find a virtual photon of invariant mass @xmath1 and momentum fraction @xmath2 from a parent parton of flavor @xmath25 . in this section ,",

    "[ fig4](b ) are enhanced in comparison with those in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , particularly , in the small @xmath2 region .",
    "although we do not have the lowest order gluon - to - virtual - photon fragmentation functions due to @xmath129 , qcd evolution in eq .",
    "( [ rg - unpol ] ) can generate the gluon - to - virtual - photon fragmentation functions . in figs .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and [ fig5](b ) , we plot gluon - to - virtual - photon fragmentation functions at @xmath114  gev and @xmath115  gev , respectively . the virtual photon mass is again chosen to be @xmath117  gev . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , qcd evolution generated gluon - to - virtual - photon fragmentation functions at @xmath117  gev grow very fast when the fragmentation scale @xmath60 increases .",
    "they are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the quark - to - virtual - photon fragmentation functions at @xmath114  gev , and only one order of magnitude smaller at @xmath115  gev .",
    "therefore , at @xmath128  gev or at a larger value of @xmath59 , qcd generated gluon - to - virtual - photon fragmentation functions become more important .    in conclusion",
    ", we have argued that virtual photon fragmentation functions are well - defined and physically meaningful .",
    "we derive the evolution equations for virtual photon fragmentation functions , and show that these fragmentation functions are perturbatively calculable .",
    "we demonstrate that qcd resummation of the large logarithms caused by quark and gluon radiation provides a very important contribution to the fragmentation functions when the fragmentation scale @xmath59 is large and/or the invariant mass @xmath1 is relatively small .",
    "just like pion fragmentation functions @xcite , the virtual photon fragmentation functions derived here are universal and can be applied to any processes with massive lepton - pair production . in the rest of this paper , we discuss some potential applications of our results .",
    "contributions of fragmentation functions @xmath130 to the physical observables generally depend on the production of the parent partons at the same @xmath2 .",
    "since the cross sections for producing the parent partons strongly depend on the momenta of the produced partons , the role of the fragmentation functions may be different for different regions of the @xmath2 values .",
    "for example , for the drell - yan production , if the cross section is dominated by the small @xmath2 region , the produced virtual photons will likely be longitudinally polarized . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cross section is dominated by the large @xmath2 region , the virtual photon will be transversely polarized .",
    "for a fixed collision energy @xmath23 , the drell - yan cross sections depend on the @xmath2-value from @xmath131 $ ] to 1 with the rapidity @xmath132 . for @xmath117  gev and @xmath133 at @xmath134  tev ( the new tevatron energy ) , @xmath135 and 0.05 for @xmath136 and 50  gev , respectively .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) that the produced virtual photons at @xmath137  gev are more likely to be transversely polarized . at @xmath136  gev , the longitudinally polarized fragmentation functions in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) are much larger than the transverse fragmentation functions in small @xmath2 region , and the @xmath138 factor in eq .",
    "( [ q - fac ] ) for the convolution over @xmath2 is also favor for producing a longitudinally polarized virtual photon .",
    "but , the cross section for producing a parent parton of momentum @xmath6 at small @xmath139 is a very steep falling function of @xmath6 , and consequently , it strongly reduces the rate for producing a longitudinally polarized virtual photon . in conclusion , when @xmath0 is large , the virtual photon produced in drell - yan massive lepton - pair production is more likely to be transversely polarized .",
    "recently , it was found that the j/@xmath3 mesons produced at fermilab tevatron become more longitudinally polarized as the transverse momentum increases @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "various theoretical calculations predict the j/@xmath3 mesons to be more transversely polarized @xcite . the virtual photon production ( extracted from drell - yan massive lepton - pair production ) at large @xmath0 and small @xmath30 has a lot in common with the j/@xmath3 production at high @xmath0 .",
    "they both have two large physical scales : @xmath0 and @xmath30 , which is equal to @xmath140 in the case of j/@xmath3 production ; and @xmath32 is much larger than @xmath30 .",
    "if the collision energy @xmath23 is large enough and the logarithm @xmath22 is so important that the resummed fragmentation contributions dominate the production cross sections , the virtual photon and j/@xmath3 production will share the _ same _ partonic subprocesses , labeled by the @xmath141 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . with their respected fragmentation functions ,",
    "both the virtual photon and j/@xmath3 production at high @xmath0 are perturbatively calculable @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , the virtual photon fragmentation functions are completely perturbative , while the parton to j/@xmath3 fragmentation functions involve final - state nonperturbative interactions .",
    "therefore , only difference between the virtual photon and j/@xmath3 production at high @xmath0 and large @xmath23 is the final - state strong interactions during the formation of j/@xmath3 meson .",
    "we propose to measure the virtual photon polarization in drell - yan massive lepton - pair production at large @xmath0 and low @xmath30 . the measurements of the virtual photon s polarization at high @xmath0",
    "provide not only a good test of qcd perturbation theory , but also a reference process to test the models of j/@xmath3 formation .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the fragmentation functions from a parton @xmath142 to a physical j/@xmath3 can be approximated by the fragmentation functions to a virtual gluon of invariant mass @xmath1 , which immediately decay into a @xmath143-pair , convoluted with a transition from the @xmath143-pair to a physical j/@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation functions for a parton to a virtual gluon should be perturbatively calculable , and their dependence on the polarization should be very similar to that of the virtual photon fragmentation functions .",
    "but , the produced charm and anticharm quark pair of invariant mass @xmath1 can in principle radiate gluons and have soft interactions with other partons in the collisions .",
    "however , due to the heavy quark mass , such final - state interactions during the formation or transition from the produced @xmath143-pair to a physical j/@xmath3 meson are not expected to significantly change the polarization @xcite .",
    "if the formation from the @xmath143-pair of invariant mass @xmath1 to a physical j/@xmath3 meson does not change the polarization , one can expect the polarization of the j/@xmath3 mesons produced at high @xmath0 to be similar to the polarization of the virtual photon in drell - yan massive lepton - pair production at the same kinematics .",
    "for example , the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) model of j/@xmath3 production predicts the j/@xmath3 mesons to be transversely polarized at large transverse momentum @xcite , which is not consistent with recent fermilab data @xcite .",
    "since the leptons do not interact strongly once produced , the measurements of the virtual photon polarization in drell - yan massive lepton - pair production at large transverse momentum should help us to narrow the questions about j/@xmath3 production .",
