    "spatial keyword query processing  @xcite allows users to submit queries that not only specify `` what '' the user is searching for , e.g. , in the form of keywords or names of consumer products of interest , but also specify `` where '' information , e.g. , street addresses , postal codes , or geographic coordinates like latitude and longitude .",
    "for instance , a search may request a `` good micro - brewery that serves pizza '' and that is close to the user s hotel .",
    "in general , a spatial keyword query retrieves a set of spatial web objects that are located close to the query location and whose text descriptions are relevant to the query keywords .",
    "figure  [ fig : topkpoint ] illustrates an example spatial keyword query @xmath1 ( located at the dot ) with keywords ` outdoor seating ' that requests the top-5 restaurants ( denoted by squares ) in london from tripadvisor based on a scoring function that performs a weighted sum on the spatial distance and text relevance of restaurants .",
    "several variants of the spatial keyword query have been studied recently .",
    "they differ in terms of the query arguments and in how the relevance of the objects to the query arguments is determined ( scoring functions ) .",
    "a continuously moving top-@xmath0 spatial keyword query  @xcite requests an up - to - date result while the query location changes continuously . a location - aware top-@xmath0 prestige - based text retrieval query  @xcite increases the ranking of objects that have highly ranked nearby objects .",
    "a collective spatial keyword query  @xcite retrieves a set of objects that together match query keywords .",
    "rocha - junior and nrvg  @xcite consider spatial keyword search in road networks , and li et al .",
    "@xcite study the spatial keyword search constrained by the moving direction .",
    "the majority of existing proposals retrieve single objects as elements in the result .",
    "however , users may be more interested in regions , or areas , that satisfy their query needs rather than in a set of objects that are scattered in space .",
    "for instance , a user who is interested in purchasing jeans may prefer to visit a region with several shops that sell jeans , rather than visit shops that are further apart .",
    "in addition , similar objects ( with the same functionality ) are often located close to each other and thus form small regions , such as shopping , dinning , and entertainment districts  @xcite .",
    "previous studies  @xcite consider the co - location relationship between objects and retrieve regions so that the total weights of objects inside the result regions are maximized .",
    "however , these proposals impose specific shapes on the result regions , either fixed - size rectangles or circles .",
    "a recent study  @xcite computes a maximum - sum region where the road network distance between objects is less than a query constraint and the sum of the scores of the objects inside the region is maximized .",
    "nevertheless , this kind of query may retrieve a region containing many objects with low scores and may ignore a promising region with few objects with high scores .",
    "also , the query includes a query range that reduces the search space .",
    "the performance is unknown if the query range is set to cover the whole data set .",
    "we aim at a solution that supports browsing , or exploratory , user behavior .",
    "it should have no constraints on the shapes of the retrieved regions .",
    "to this end , we view regions of interest as spatial textual clusters and propose and study a new type of query , namely the top-@xmath0 * spatial textual cluster * ( @xmath0-stc ) query that returns the top-@xmath0 clusters such that ( i ) each cluster contains relevant spatial web objects with regard to query keywords , ( ii ) the density of each cluster satisfies a query constraint , and ( iii ) the clusters are ranked based on both their spatial distance and text relevance with regards to the query arguments . figure  [ fig : topkregion ]",

    "the top-5 spatial textual clusters ( restaurants in london from tripadvisor ) are illustrated in the figure .",
    "clusters can be found using different approaches .",
    "we adopt density - based clustering that has several advantages : ( i ) no need to specify the number of clusters , ( ii ) clusters can have arbitrary shapes , and ( iii ) clusters are robust to outliers .",
    "the two basic steps for top-@xmath0 stc retrieval are ( i ) obtaining the objects that are relevant to the query keywords and ( ii ) applying a density based clustering algorithm to these objects to find the top-@xmath0 clusters .",
    "the clustering algorithm processes the objects in a pre - defined order .",
    "it terminates when no cluster with a better score can be found .",
    "we consider a cluster scoring function ( introduced in section  [ sec : prob - def ] ) that favors clusters close to the query location and that contain objects with high relevance with regard to the query keywords .",
    "different query keywords result in different clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : strex ] demonstrates the top-5 clusters of restaurants obtained by two queries located at the same location ( black dot ) , but with different keywords , namely ` local cuisine ' and ` dessert ' .",
    "we are not aware of the query keywords until a query arrives , so pre - computing the clusters for all possible sets of query keywords is infeasible .",
    "we target an efficient algorithm that is able to find top-@xmath0 clusters with a response time that supports interactive search .",
    "[ fig : strex ]    more specifically , we propose a basic algorithm that combines on - line density - based clustering with an early stop condition .",
    "this algorithm applies the state - of - the - art density based clustering algorithm dbscan  @xcite to objects indexed by an ir - tree  @xcite to find top-@xmath0 clusters .",
    "this algorithm has to check the neighborhood of each relevant object in order to identify dense neighborhoods , since a cluster found by dbscan consists of core objects and their dense neighborhoods .",
    "we propose an advance algorithm that reduces the number of objects to be examined .",
    "moreover , determining whether a neighborhood is dense or not is time - consuming , since it involves range queries on the ir - tree . we design spatially gridded posting lists ( sgpl ) to estimate the selectivity of range queries on the ir - tree , so that sparse neighborhoods can be detected quickly without querying the index , thus saving computational cost .",
    "further , sgpl is able to handle the necessary range queries more efficiently compared with the basic algorithm .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", we are the first to study the top-@xmath0 spatial textual clusters query .",
    "this paper s contributions are :    * we introduce the top-@xmath0 spatial textual clusters query that returns close , relevant , and dense clusters in order to support exploratory user behavior . * a basic algorithm that exploits the density - based algorithm dbscan with an early stop condition on the ir - tree . * in order to provide response times that enable interactive search , we propose an advanced approach that includes the following techniques .",
    "* * in order to retrieve clusters , the neighborhood of each object has to be checked in the basic algorithm .",
    "we design a skipping rule that reduces the number of objects to be examined . * * a result cluster consists of dense neighborhoods .",
    "however , determining whether a neighborhood is dense in the basic algorithm involves an expansive range query on the index . we design spatially gridded posting lists ( sgpl ) to estimate the selectivity of range queries , thus enabling the pruning of sparse neighborhoods . *",
    "* the sgpl is also able to support range queries , so that a performance gain is obtained for the range queries that can not be avoided , compared with the basic algorithm . *",
    "an extensive empirical study with real data demonstrates that the paper s proposals offer scalability and are capable of excellent performance .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prob - def ] formally defines the top-@xmath0 spatial textual cluster query .",
    "the basic algorithm is presented in section  [ sec : baseline ] .",
    "we present the advanced approach in section  [ sec : advance ] , including three techniques : ( i ) a skipping rule that reduces the number of objects to be examined ( section  [ sec : reduce ] ) , ( ii ) the spatially gridded posting lists ( sgpl ) for selectivity estimation of range queries ( section  [ sec : histogram ] ) , and ( iii ) a fast range query processing algorithm on sgpl ( section  [ sec : fastrange ] ) .",
    "we report on the empirical performance study in section  [ sec : exp ] .",
    "finally , we cover related work in section  [ sec : related ] and offer conclusions and research directions in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we consider a data set @xmath2 in which each object @xmath3 is a pair @xmath4 of a point location @xmath5 and a text description , or document , @xmath6 ( e.g. , the facilities and menu of a restaurant ) .",
