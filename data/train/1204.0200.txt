    "it reflects our theoretical msw s considerations which , in our opinion , may be useful for concerned readers .",
    "next preprints will reflect our numeric simulations of msw and magnetic - wave chaos in films and corresponding real experiments .",
    "it should be noticed that a portion of the following sections 2 and 3 already was presented ( in a modified form ) by arxiv preprint [ yu.kuzovlev , n.mezin , and g.yarosh , cond - mat/0405640 ] , but we keep it here for better reader s accommodation .",
    "2.1 . magnetic torque equation .    in the classical phenomenology of ferro- and ferri - magnetic solids [ 1 - 6 ]",
    ", their magnetization is characterized by 3-dimensional vector field , @xmath0 , representing density of elementary magnetic moments . the important property of this vector is that its length is constant : @xmath1 , with @xmath2 termed saturation magnetization .",
    "hence , it is natural to measure magnetization and magnetic fields in @xmath3 units and introduce the unit - length `` spin '' vector @xmath4 by means of @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "then natural time unit will be @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath9 mhz / oe ) [ 1 - 3 ] . by this definition , @xmath10 is period of precession of a separate spin at field equal to @xmath3 .",
    "the rotation of @xmath11 is subject to the landau - lifshitz torque equation [ 1 - 6 ] which in these units reads @xmath12+\\gamma \\{{f - s\\langle s , f\\rangle \\}}\\,\\,,\\ ,   f=-\\frac{% \\delta e}{\\delta s}\\,\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath13 being magnetic energy functional and @xmath14 full effective local magnetic field acting on spins ( called also local thermodynamic force ) .",

    "after transition to dimensionless time , @xmath13 is factual energy divided by @xmath20 , hence , its dimensionality is spatial volume , while @xmath21 becomes dimensionless .",
    "the term containing @xmath22 represents `` friction '' , i.e. dissipative interaction between magnetization and other microscopic degrees of freedom ( thermostat ) .",
    "it can be written in several equivalent forms in view of identities @xmath23 % \\,=\\,(1-s\\otimes s)\\,f\\,\\ ] ] in principle , the eq.1 is the only possible law of magnetic dynamics compatible simultaneously with the constancy @xmath6 , energy conservation under spin rotation itself and total energy balance with thermostat . in",
    "non - principally complicated models the friction may depend on spatial gradients of magnetization , @xmath24 .",
    "ferromagnetic energy .",
    "in any magnet , its energy functional @xmath25 includes    \\(i ) anisotropy energy    @xmath26    which dictates locally preferred magnetization orientation ( @xmath27 is volume differential ) ;    \\(ii ) exchange interaction energy , which ensures local spatial uniformity of @xmath28 pattern ,    @xmath29    it is invariant with respect to @xmath30 rotation ; in general , it may be anisotropic with respect to gradient ;    \\(iii ) dipole interaction energy which causes long - range non - uniformity ( demagnetization ) of @xmath31 pattern and initializes formation of magnetic domains :    @xmath32    with @xmath33 being the integral operator ,    @xmath34    and @xmath35 the @xmath36-matrix function    @xmath37    \\(iv ) interaction with an external magnetic field @xmath38 ,    @xmath39    in summary , @xmath40 the dots replace additional interactions for instance , with distortions and defects of atomic lattice . as a rule , their contribution to long magnetic waves related phenomena ( to be under our interest ) can be either neglected or reduced to renormalization of @xmath3 , @xmath41or other material parameters [ 1,2,5 ] . from experiments",
    "it is known that especial surface anisotropy may cause pinning of magnetization on the sample surface .",
    "this effect can be described in terms of boundary conditions for the spin field @xmath42 [ 8 ] .",
    "for example , in good quality yttrium - iron garnet ( yig ) ferrites [ 4,5 ] , @xmath43oe , correspondingly @xmath44ns the exchange interaction radius @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 cm , characteristic anisotropy field is less than @xmath48 ( that is @xmath49 @xmath50 ) , and the dimensionless friction coefficient @xmath51 is rather small , @xmath52 @xmath53 .",
    "dipole interaction .",
    "the dipole contribution ( 4 ) is nothing but approximate form of complete magnetization interaction with self - induced magnetic field , @xmath54 .",
    "usually , characteristic spatial scales ( sample size , wavelength ) and group velocity of magnetic waves are much less than length and velocity , respectively , of free - space electromagnetic wave with the same frequency .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 can be obtained as solution to quasi - static maxwell equations @xmath56 even in high - frequency ( microwave ) band .",
    "besides if there are no metal surfaces in the vicinity of magnetic sample ( waveguide walls or other ) , one can suppose @xmath57 at infinity and come to ( 4 ) .",
    "oppositely , eqs.7 should be solved under actual boundary conditions at surroundings and expression ( 4 ) be generalized as @xmath58 .",
    "the principal peculiarity of dipole interaction is its specific long - range character : with increasing distance @xmath59 it decreases exactly as the volume marked by this distance grows @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , the integral dipole force ( 5 ) is indifferent to absolute spatial scales of magnetization pattern and depends on their ratios only .",
    "in particular , for uniform magnetization it depends on a shape of magnetic sample but not on its size .",
    "static magnetization .",
    "let @xmath62 stands for a static ( equilibrium , metastable or unstable ) magnetization configuration in a constant external field , @xmath63 . according to eq.1",
    ", the essence of static state is that everywhere spins are oriented in parallel to thermodynamic force , @xmath64 , that is    @xmath65    where scalar function @xmath66(complete internal magnetic field ) is determined by the requirement @xmath67 . generally speaking ,",
    "this equation possesses many solutions ( various domain structures ) whose physical realization depends on history of the system .",
    "but if @xmath68 is sufficiently strong then @xmath69an unique solution must stay only [ 1 ] , even in spite of the dipole interaction , since the dipole force ( 5 ) is bounded , @xmath70 , at any nonsingular magnetization distribution .",
    "magnetic excitations .",
    "consider perturbation of static state , @xmath71 , for instance , caused by additional time - varying external field , @xmath72 , when @xmath73 . under a perturbation",
    ", the energy divides into two parts @xmath74 , the ground @xmath75 and excess energy @xmath76 which vanishes at @xmath77 and in its turn consists of two parts    @xmath78    @xmath79 the first contribution to ( 9 ) arises from interaction between @xmath80and static magnetization ( lowering static magnetic order by magnetic excitations when @xmath81 @xmath82 , or , in opposite , maintaining it , when @xmath83 ) .",
    "the second , @xmath84 , represents @xmath85 interaction with itself .",
    "its construction is quite similar to @xmath86 except that anisotropy term is modified : @xmath87    this self - interaction induces the response operator @xmath88 , as defined by @xmath89 evidently , in case of easy axis or easy plane anisotropy , when @xmath90 and hence @xmath91 are quadratic forms @xmath92 is purely linear operator . in general , it is reasonable ( and commonly used ) approximation if possible dependence of @xmath92 on @xmath93 is took into account while its nonlinearity ( dependence on @xmath94 ) neglected , thus replacing @xmath92 by linear operator    @xmath95    2.6 .",
    "hamiltonian formulation .    due to @xmath96 ,",
    "only two of three components of the excitation @xmath85 must be considered as independent variables namely , the components perpendicular to @xmath62 , since weak excitation is always perpendicular to @xmath62 .",
    "thus define the two - dimensional vector @xmath97 where matrix @xmath98 performs projection onto the plane , @xmath99 , perpendicular to @xmath62 .",
    "evidently , @xmath100 where scalar @xmath101 represents projection of @xmath30 onto the static magnetization direction , and    @xmath102 the torque equation ( 1 ) transforms into    @xmath103+\\gamma ( 1{-}\\,s_{\\bot } \\otimes s_{\\bot } { ) } f_{\\bot } \\,\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\",

    "simultaneously such a choice of variables ensures unambiguous parametrization of @xmath101 even in case of spin flipping when @xmath111 can become negative .",
    "dynamic equations for magnetization .",

    "then the eqs.14 - 15 takes more pragmatic form :    @xmath116    to be supplemented by relations ( 11 - 13 ) .",
    "note that @xmath117 @xmath118,@xmath119 @xmath120,@xmath121 , and the latter equality is equivalent to @xmath122 @xmath123 in planes @xmath99 .    in generalized version of eq.19 ,",
    "direct dipole interaction is replaced , in analogy with ( 7 ) , by self - induced field of the excitation , @xmath124 , according to the rule @xmath125 @xmath126 .",
    "in such an approach    @xmath127    and eq.19 should be solved together with magnetostatic equations    @xmath128    under classical electromagnetic boundary conditions at the sample surface and surrounding bodies .",
    "2.8 . small - amplitude dynamics .",
    "if a static state @xmath129 is stable , i.e. represents ( global or local ) energy minimum in the space of magnetization configurations then @xmath130 , for small @xmath80 , is positive quadratic form .",
    "hence , we have rights to speak about small - amplitude magnetic oscillations and waves .",
    "linearization of eq.19 results in    @xmath131    or , in the self - induced field representation ,    @xmath132    let the perturbation and hence linear response vary harmonically : @xmath133 @xmath134 , and so on ( @xmath135 @xmath136 .",
    "then eq.23 formally yields    @xmath137    substituting this expression to eqs.21 , we transform the problem to solving partial differential equations    @xmath138    here @xmath139 and @xmath140 are play the role of linear polarizability and susceptibility operators [ 2 ] . with respect to polarization , @xmath139 acts as @xmath141-matrix performing projection onto planes @xmath142 .",
    "it may be thought local spin precession response to given local magnetic field , but , from the rigorous mathematical point of view , presence of the laplasian @xmath143 makes it integral ( nonlocal ) operator .",
    "linear free waves .    omitting in ( 22 ) friction and external pump ,",
    "one can find eigenmodes and eigen - frequencies of free magnetic waves ( mw ) :    @xmath144    it is sufficient to consider positive frequencies only , @xmath145 , since opposite sign means complex conjugating the same mode .",
    "let different modes be enumerated by a set of indexes @xmath146 .",
    "since operator @xmath147 is positively defined , we can rewrite ( 26 ) as @xmath148 operator in the left equation is hermitian because @xmath149 is hermitian , hence , the solutions can be chosen mutually orthogonal and normalized to @xmath150 @xmath151 ( with kroneker symbol on right - hand side ) . returning to ( 27 ) and ( 26 )",

    "this means merely that spin vector draws elliptic trajectory whose main axes are just @xmath155 and @xmath157 .    2.10 .",

    "what is the matter ?",
    "the answer comes from eqs.1 and 38 : the smaller thickness the smaller group velocity of irradiated waves @xmath404 , therefore , the smaller is energy outflow from the inductor . assume this outflow be proportional to product @xmath405 , equate it to the pumped power @xmath406 and combine the resulting relation with @xmath407 @xmath400 .",

    "this rise becomes better clear if notice that less group velocity means greater density of ( excited ) states ( what is highlighted by right - hand peaks condensation in fig.1b ) .",
    "incidentally , we can conclude that @xmath419 , i.e. at given current the more thin is film the stronger swing of magnetization and thus the closer nonlinear excitation regime .",

    "the important conclusion from both theory and numerical simulations is that even two mw modes ( i.e. four variables : two amplitudes and two phases ) are sufficient to realize chaotic behavior .    in standard scenario ,",
    "the mechanism of chaos is dependence of frequencies of the modes on amplitudes because of their nonlinear self - interaction and mutual parametric interaction . at small amplitudes they are coherently ( resonantly or parametrically ) excited by external field and one by another . at large amplitudes",

    "hence , the same property ( non - isochronity ) of magnetization oscillations at the same degree of nonlinearity is responsible for both chaos in only two - mode model and for regular soliton structures consisting of very many mw modes ( let us recollect that autonomous nse dynamics is integrable and thus can not produce chaos [ 20 ] ) .",
    "this fact demonstrates that principal origin of magnetic chaos is nothing but energy transfer through magnetic system ( from external source to thermostat ) . in other words",
    "this is dissipative chaos characterized by phase volume contraction and dissipative strange ( zero lebesgue measure ) attractors [ 21 ] , although ( due to small friction ) possessing many properties of hamiltonian chaos [ 21 ] . then , it is not surprising that just the power absorption ( energy consumption by a ferromagnet sample per unit time ) mostly highlights magnetic chaos [ 2,17,18 ] and can be used as control variable for its identification and synchronization [ 19 ] .    in principle , in presence of periodic perturbation accompanied by dissipation even an individual spin ( magnetic moment with fixed length and thus two independent variables only ) can undergo chaotic behavior [ 22 - 24 ] .",
    "nevertheless the two mw modes are too few to adequately imitate real magnetic chaos since they are forced to incur roles of other modes .",
    "therefore a variety of many - mode models was suggested for numerical investigation [ 2 ] which are able to reproduce ( i ) typically observed spikes in the power time series ( ii ) their intermittency , ( iii ) their fractal properties and , moreover , ( iv ) characteristic frequencies of chaotic power oscillations usually in the interval from 0.1 mhz to 10 mhz .",

    "if @xmath736is known then the number , @xmath740 , of variables which are governing chaotic dynamics can be found as the integer number exceeding @xmath746but most close to it .",
    "the cases when @xmath747 ( and thus @xmath748 ) are called hyperchaos . for the same purpose of @xmath740 determination , the correlation dimension can be used .",
    "the correlation dimension [ 25 ] , @xmath749 , characterizes statistics of distances between points of the attractor taken at discrete time moments @xmath750 , with some reasonable time interval @xmath751and @xmath752 , at @xmath753 .",
    "let @xmath754 , @xmath755 , be relevant variables under consideration .",
    "then the set of distancies    @xmath756^{2}\\}^{1/2}\\ ] ] @xmath69is investigated as characterized by the so - called correlation sum ,    @xmath757    due to fractal ( scale - invariant ) structure of cantor sets it can be expected that at small distances and large number of points the power law takes place :    @xmath758    where @xmath759 is some constant , and the right - hand limit of the correlation sum presents definition of @xmath760 . naturally , under rather general assumptions @xmath761 @xmath736[25 - 28 ] .",
    "there are two important statements .",
    "first , @xmath762is insensible to smooth transformations of attractor variables including ( not too long ) time delays . therefore , equivalently one may analyze discrete sequence , @xmath763 , of any available variable , @xmath764(of course , well connected to attractor ) , considering the subsequences @xmath765 @xmath766 @xmath767 , with @xmath768 , quite like the attractor points above .",
    "second , in principle , estimate of @xmath762is insensible to @xmath206 ( called embedding dimension ) if only @xmath769 .",
    "but it is sensible to noise , either external parasitic one ( errors of measurements etc . ) or ham noise produced by a real system itself .",
    "hence , a factual @xmath770 s dependence on @xmath206 can inform about quality of data under analysis .    from the other hand , in general structure of chaos ( strange attractor )",
    "may be better characterized by a spectrum of fractal dimensions instead of a single one [ 27,28 ] .",
    "then different variables may give more or less different correlation dimensions .",
    "the essence of chaotic motion is its exponential instability , that is exponential growth of response to arbitrarily small disturbance .",
    "nevertheless this motion obey deterministic law . hence ,",
    "if its current state is controlled with accuracy up to @xmath222 binary digits then its future can be somehow predicted for a time , @xmath771 , proportional to @xmath772 .",
    "then @xmath773is called entropy of chaotic attractor , while the sense of @xmath774 is lifetime of information bits .",
    "the latter approximately coincides with characteristic correlation time of chaotic variables [ 21,33 ] .",
    "let there are two identical chaotic generators initially delivered in the same state to some extent of precision . to keep the same equality of states in future and thus synchronize one generator by another , we should send from one to another at least one bit of information per time @xmath775 .",
    "a representative chaotic variable carry just such the amount of information and hence can be used for the synchronization [ 29,30 ] .",
    "the real example of magnetic chaos synchronization was reported in [ 19 ] .    however , to make this minimum necessary information to be also factually sufficient , it should be chosen and applied in adequate way . concretely , one must take into account the topology of attractors i.e. graph of transitions between its cantor subsets . for example",
    "[ 34 ] , the discrete - time chaotic evolution described by the tent map , @xmath776 @xmath777 , with @xmath778 , has @xmath779 , i.e. one bit of information per time step is sufficient for synchronization .",
    "but this principal possibility turns into reality if only the bit is chosen be @xmath780 at @xmath781 and @xmath782 at @xmath783 , with certainly @xmath784 . any other rule ( or other @xmath785 ) either leads to errors or requires additional information .",
    "generally , determination of adequate rule ( termed generating partition of phase space ) and corresponding most meaningful information sequences ( so - called symbolic dynamics ) is very non - trivial task [ 34,35 ] , even if dynamic law of chaos is known , all the more if it is under question . from this point of view , the results of [ 19 ] seem extremely interesting .    in principle , an adequate rule allows to synchronize non - identical attractors too if they have similar topologies and equal entropies . at more simplified approaches to synchronization",
    "( but instead practically applied ones see [ 31,32 ] and references therein ) , rather small non - identity of `` master '' and `` slave '' chaotic systems can forbid it , even in spite of quantitative excess of information .",
    "let @xmath786 and @xmath787 are vector ( @xmath788-dimensional ) variables of two chaotic systems which obey the same dynamic equations but the second is influenced by the first as follows :    @xmath789    here @xmath790 is positive matrix , hence , it introduces additional damping .",
    "let the latter is so strong that suppresses exponential instability of the slave system .",
    "then it easy to see that after some time the only possible solution for @xmath787 will exactly reproduce @xmath786 , and thus one can say that the slave system is ideally synchronized by the master system .    perhaps however , it would be more correct to name this copying chaos .",
    "indeed , the slave factually loses its autonomy ( since at @xmath791 it would produce neither chaos nor any other motion instead tending to a stable state ) , and behaves as passive repeater of external signal .    in more general and fine variant of such kind of synchronization ,    @xmath792    where @xmath793 is some ( say first ) of @xmath788 attractor variables and again function @xmath794 of two arguments",
    "is arranged so that first equation produces chaos while solution of the second falls into stable point solution as @xmath795 .",
    "the copying of chaos is rather sensible to non - identity of the slave and master systems to adding external noise or any distortion of master signal in transmission channel ( see , for instance , [ 36 ] and references therein ) .",
    "relative error of the reproduction occurs be at least the same as relative difference of master and slave parameters plus noise to signal ratio and plus relative distortions .    in practical applications more reasonable approach may be to surely recognize and reproduce some particular characteristics of chaotic signal only , instead of its literal but erroneous copying .",
    "the example is mutual phase synchronization of chaotic oscillators ( for instance , famous rossler systems ) which does not need in simultaneous amplitude synchronization and therefore is possible for non - identical oscillators in presence of noise .",
    "more general possibility is so - called event synchronization where events mean definite well characterizable fragments of chaotic trajectory .",
    "then the natural step is an artificial creation of events in master system which can serve for encoding information and then its decoding in similar slave system .",
    "in particular , this may be switching between different trajectories on the same attractor .",
    "when artificially manipulating trajectory of a chaotic system , one needs in a set ( alphabet ) of easy creatable and identifiable `` events '' . such the possibility is ensured by unstable periodic orbits ( upo ) , i.e. periodic trajectories which always take place on chaotic attractors .",
    "moreover , from practical point of view one may treat a strange attractor merely as a collections of periodic orbits with different length , from some minimum period up to infinity .",
    "the instability of finite - length orbits means that their measure ( relative number of attractor points belonging them ) is zero , therefore , almost even insignificant deviation from short periodic orbit for certain injects to very long one ( chaotic ) .",
    "but , remarkably , upo s can be stabilized and thus practically installed into master s chaotic trajectory by means of specially programmed feedback ( see , for example , [ 37 ] ) .",
    "then similar feedback in slave system helps to unambiguously recognize an upo s installation although it looks quite as typical fragment of transmitted signal .",
    "such the discrete chaotic encryption of information can well protect it from noise and signal distortions .    during recent decade many ideas of chaos application to secure communication",
    "were suggested .",
    "one of schemes successfully realized in [ 31 ] is based on introducing communication signal , @xmath796 , into eqs.29 :    @xmath797    thus the master ( in [ 31 ] it is chaotic chua s generator ) produces chaos influenced by the signal .",
    "the factually transmitted information is the sum @xmath798 @xmath799 . if the communication @xmath796 was absent @xmath800 would be precise copy of @xmath786 .",
    "therefore the communication can be restored as @xmath801 .",
    "analogously , discrete chaos ( chaotic maps ) can be used .",
    "for simplest example , let @xmath776 @xmath802 be some one - dimensional chaotic map , and we introduce discrete - time information @xmath796 by means of @xmath776 @xmath803 . if @xmath804 @xmath805 is sent , then in identical receiving system the information can be recovered merely as @xmath806 @xmath807 @xmath808 .",
    "this possibility was suggested in [ 38 ] for information encoding in chaotic impulse communication .",
    "principally similar ideas were experimentally realized for communication with optical chaos [ 39 ] .",
    "the peculiarity of the latter is an essential time delay in a feedback part of optical ( laser ) chaotic generators .",
    "correspondingly , their dynamics undergo difference - differential nonlinear equations which can produce chaos whose fractal dimensionality , @xmath736 , exceeds formal number of variables ( number of equations ) .    such the schemes ( in which an information is either masked by chaos or modulates it ) possess all the potential defects of chaos copying .",
    "besides they do not allow for multiple - access chaotic communication ( many senders ) in the same time - frequency domain .",
    "the matter is that chaotic system can not recognize even its own signal if is mixed with a signal from other system .",
    "still chaotic extension of modern digital code - division multiple access ( cdma ) communication is under discussion .",
    "although cdma also uses chaotic signals ( pseudo - random coding sequences ) but these are discrete exactly predictable ( periodic ) signals only whose entropy is zero . the interesting scheme of multiplexed chaotic communication based on analog chaotic signals was suggested in [ 40,41 ] .",
    "it shows how the unrecognizability of mixed chaotic messages can be overcame .",
    "the idea is that all the users simultaneously take part in creating chaos which thus becomes common for all the network and therefore recognizable by any participating chaotic generator . at present form",
    ", however , this scheme needs in temporal separation of users and other limitations [ 40,41 ] .    _",
