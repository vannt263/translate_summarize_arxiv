    "the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics imposes fundamental limits to hypothesis testing and parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "such limits are relevant to many metrological applications , such as optical interferometry , optomechanical sensing , gravitational - wave detection @xcite , optical imaging @xcite , magnetometry , gyroscopy , and atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "the ultimate quantum limits to parameter estimation have been studied extensively in recent years , as they imply that a minimum amount of resource , such as the average photon number for optical phase estimation , is needed to achieve a desired precision , regardless of the measurement method .    for the measurement of a single optical phase parameter ,",
    "the ultimate quantum limit to the mean - square error scales as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the average photon number of the field which undergoes that phase shift .",
    "this scaling is often called the heisenberg limit .",
    "after years of speculation and debate @xcite , the heisenberg limit for single - parameter linear phase estimation has only recently been proven @xcite .",
    "although decoherence , such as optical loss and dephasing , can impose stricter limitations @xcite , the heisenberg limit is a more fundamental bound and will be increasingly relevant as quantum technologies continue to improve and decoherence effects are further reduced .",
    "many real - world tasks , such as optical imaging @xcite , quantum tomography and system identification @xcite , and waveform estimation ( e.g.  estimating a signal that varies continuously in time ) @xcite , require the estimation of multiple parameters .",
    "multiparameter quantum cramr - rao bounds have been known since the 1970s @xcite , but efforts to derive multiparameter heisenberg limits from these bounds have not been successful . this is not surprising , since even in the case of single - parameter phase estimation , it is not possible , without additional assumptions on the state , to derive the heisenberg limit from the quantum cramr - rao bound .",
    "( the latter gives a lower bound on the mean - square error of @xmath6 , which does not imply the heisenberg limit of @xmath4 , as can be seen from the state @xmath7 which has @xmath8 but divergent @xmath9 . )    in ref .",
    "@xcite , some of us recently proposed a heisenberg - style limit for the estimation of an optical phase waveform with stationary gaussian prior statistics and a power - law spectrum .",
    "however , that limit , being derived from a quantum cramr - rao bound , requires additional assumptions : it applies only to the specific class of optical beams described by gaussian fields , with statistics that are both stationary and time - symmetric .",
    "a very different approach was that of ref .",
    "@xcite , which derives a multiparameter heisenberg limit for independent parameters by applying the single - parameter heisenberg limit to each parameter . in practice ,",
    "multiple parameters often have nontrivial prior correlations , particularly in the case of continuous waveform estimation , where the correlations are crucial to pose the problem @xcite .",
    "thus the existence of general heisenberg limits for such cases has remained an open question .    in this paper , we derive new quantum bounds on multiparameter estimation by developing quantum versions of the bell - ziv - zakai bounds .",
    "the bell - ziv - zakai bounds were proposed in 1997 by bell _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , building upon the ziv - zakai bound @xcite , and futher generalized by basu and bresler @xcite .",
    "we then apply our bounds to the notable task of quantum optical phase waveform estimation . here , the waveform to be estimated is a time - varying phase shift signal , @xmath10 , applied to an optical beam . for a waveform @xmath10 with stationary gaussian prior statistics and a power - law spectrum ( @xmath11 ) , we prove a lower bound on the mean - square error with a @xmath2 scaling , where @xmath3 is the mean photon flux .",
    "this proof confirms that the scaling previously proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid for arbitrary quantum states .",
    "moreover , we show that this scaling is achievable for all @xmath1 .",
    "previously , achievability has been shown only numerically , and only for @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "by contrast the results in the current paper are completely rigorous heisenberg bounds , being both applicable to arbitrary field states , and achievable , for all @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is separated into two main parts . the first part , sec .",
