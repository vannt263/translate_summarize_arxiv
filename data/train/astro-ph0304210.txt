    "x - ray spectral studies of radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , reveal very frequently the presence of ionised material .",
    "this was first noted by halpern ( 1984 ) , based on _ einstein _",
    "ipc data , where it was also noted that these absorbers vary .",
    "evidence for ionized absorption along the line of sight was provided by nandra & pounds ( 1992 ) , based on the detection of an absorption edge in @xmath1 observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "fabian et al ( 1994 ) were able to disentangle the ovii and oviii k - edges of this warm absorber using the much better spectral resolution of @xmath11 .    in the years that followed , it became evident that warm absorbers are ubiquitous among seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "reynolds ( 1997 ) and george et al ( 1998 ) showed that more than 50% of seyfert 1s contain a warm absorber .",
    "these are produced by partially ionised gas with total column density in the range @xmath12 , probably located at or outside the broad line region ( reynolds & fabian 1995 ) .    with the advent of higher resolution grating spectrographs on board _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ much more detailed studies of ionized absorbers have become possible .",
    "x - ray spectra obtained with the reflection grating spectrograph ( den herder et al 2001 ) on board _ xmm - newton _ have shown that the absorbing gas has often various components with different outflowing velocities and clearly distinct ionisation states ( see sako et al 2001 for iras 13349 + 2438 and blustin et al 2002 for ngc 3783 ) .",
    "one of the most remarkable features discovered in these spectra is the presence of unresolved transition arrays ( utas ) of fe m lines , which could mimic the shape of absorption edges when observed at the lower spectral resolution typical of ccds .",
    "detailed studies of particular agn which exhibit x - ray ionized absorption features also demonstrate that there is frequently a narrow - line absorber related to the agn ( i.e. an _ associated _ absorber ) in the ultraviolet band , normally showing up as a civ @xmath13 absorption feature ( mathur 1994 , mathur et al 1994 , mathur , elvis & wilkes 1995 ) .",
    "the same photoionized outflowing gas can provide the uv absorption lines and the ionized absorption features seen in x - ray spectra .",
    "more recently , crenshaw et al ( 1999 ) found in a systematic study of uv absorption lines towards nearby radio - quiet agn , that _ all _ objects showing uv associated absorption systems have a corresponding warm absorber in the x - rays .",
    "variability has also been found in some of these warm absorbers .",
    "fabian et al ( 1994 ) reported different absorption optical depths in the best - studied warm absorber towards mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "later , otani et al ( 1996 ) showed , using a 4-day long asca observation of this particular seyfert 1 , that the oviii k edge ( at a rest frame energy of 0.871 kev ) varied on scales of @xmath14 , while the ovii k - edge ( at a rest frame energy of 0.739 kev ) remained constant .",
    "otani et al ( 1996 ) interpreted this in terms of two different ionized absorbers , a high ionisation ( oviii ) absorber located within the blr and a lower ionisation absorber ( ovii ) probably associated to the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "h1419 + 480 was discovered in the modulation collimator - large area sky survey ( mc - lass ) conducted with the heao-1 observatory ( wood et al 1984 ) .",
    "the inferred 2 - 10 kev flux was @xmath15 , assuming a power law spectrum with a canonical @xmath16 ( ceballos & barcons 1996 ) .",
    "although the modulation collimator helped to pin down the position of the x - ray source , the flux could be severely affected by the contribution of unresolved sources within the collimator field of view .",
    "the @xmath1 all - sky survey ( rass ) also detected this source ( see schwope et al 2000 ) , with a 0.5 - 2 kev flux ( corrected for galactic absorption ) of @xmath17 and an additional pspc pointed observation conducted in 1992 found a flux of @xmath18 . in both cases the pspc hardness ratio was @xmath19 which excluded a significant photoelectric absorption by cold gas .",
    "remillard et al ( 1993 ) identified h1419 + 480 with a broad - line type 1 agn at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "appendix a presents our own optical spectroscopic observations of h1419 + 480 , which confirm that this source is a broad - line agn with @xmath23 , as derived from the [ oiii ] emission doublet .",
    "ceballos & barcons ( 1996 ) analyzed a sample of sources detected both in the mc - lass sample and by @xmath1 ( which included h1419 + 480 ) .",
    "the large decrement of the flux from hard to soft x - rays is suggestive of heavy photoelectric absorption , which is at odds with the value reported for the pspc hardness ratio .",
    "this was interpreted by ceballos & barcons ( 1996 ) as evidence for complex absorption , that could be modelled either in terms of an ionized absorber or in terms of a partial covering cold absorber .    in this paper",
    "we present _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic observations of h1419 + 480 .",
    "we find that the source has changed the soft x - ray flux again and that its 2 - 10 kev flux is almost a factor 3 lower than the heao-1 one . a warm absorber",
    "is unambiguously seen in the _ xmm - newton _ data , through mostly ovii absorption , but we argue that this warm absorber was weaker or absent in the previous pointed @xmath1 observation . an associated civ absorption line is seen in an _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ spectrum of this source taken more than 20 years ago , but it is not seen in a similar observation taken one year later .",
    "we find that both x - ray and uv absorption can be explained in terms of the same amount of gas but varying ionising conditions .",
    "h1419 + 480 was observed by _ xmm - newton _ ( jansen et al 2001 ) for 27 ks on the 27th of may of 2002 , during revolution 451 ( obsid=0094740201 ) , as part of the guaranteed time programme of the survey science centre . in this paper",
    "we analyze only the data obtained by the epic mos ( turner et al 2001 ) and epic pn ( strder et al 2001 ) cameras .",
    "the source is clearly detected by the rgs spectrographs , but it is far too faint to deliver any scientifically interesting results . the om ( mason et al 2001 ) was used to obtain images in the filters u , b and uvw1 .",
    "all 3 epic cameras had the thin 1 filter on , and they were operated in partial window mode ( mos1 and mos2 ) and small window mode ( pn ) .",
    "exposure times ( excluding overheads ) were 13 ks for the mos cameras and 20 ks for the pn camera .",
    "however , most of the exposure time was lost due to high background flaring . after cleaning out these intervals , good - time intervals of @xmath24 ks",
    "were left for the mos1 and mos2 detectors , and 3 ks were left for the pn detector . fortunately h1419 + 480 is bright enough ( 5 cts / s in the epic pn camera ) to provide a large enough number of counts for spectral analysis .",
    "event files for the 3 epic detectors were taken from the distributed pipeline products , which were obtained by processing the observation data file with sas v5.3.3 .",
    "we filtered out high - background intervals , keeping only the most reliable single and double events and , in the case of epic pn , by removing those with low spectral quality .",
    "calibration matrices were generated by using sas v5.4.1 , which we found to solve some problems at energies 0.5 - 1 kev with respect to the sas v5.3.3 calibration .",
    "x - ray spectra for h1419 + 480 and background , were extracted from the 3 epic cameras .",
    "the background spectrum was extracted from regions in the same chip as the source but not illuminated by h1419 + 480 .",
    "this was also done in the mos data , as opposed to source - free regions in the outer chips , to prevent vignetting affecting the background subtraction . the source plus background pn , mos1 and mos2 spectra were binned individually into bins containing at least 20 counts each . to fit spectral models to these data , xspec version 11.2.0 was used ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "bins outside the 0.2 - 12 kev bandpass were ignored . at the time of performing this analysis , a calibration problem ( probably produced for an incorrect redistribution matrix ) of the mos detectors below 0.5 has been reported . in this paper",
    "we have taken the conservative approach of ignoring all mos data below 0.5 kev .",
    "we first fit the 2 - 12 kev spectrum to determine the underlying continuum .",
    "a single power law fit gave @xmath25 for 311 degrees of freedom ( two parameters fitted ) , but with obvious residuals around 6 kev . adding a redshifted gaussian emission line improved the fit substantially to @xmath26 for 308 degrees of freedom .",
    "the f - test assigned a significance to the detection of this line of 99.90% .",
    "parameters resulting from the fit are listed in table  [ xraypars ] , while fig .",
    "[ contfeline ] shows the confidence contours in the line flux versus line dispersion parameter space .",
    "the line equivalent width derived from these parameters is @xmath27 .",
    "all parameters are entirely consistent with those from other seyfert 1 galaxies ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "the epic pn spectrum shows a hint of a residual towards low energies , reminiscent of relativistic effects in a disk line , but since the mos1 and mos2 spectra do not show such resudials we do not explore this point any further .",
    "this emphasizes again the importance of calibration in the detection of weak features ( such as relativistic line profiles ) in moderate signal - to - noise data . in what follows the energy of the fe line and its width",
    "have been fixed to their best - fit values ( see tab .  [ xraypars ] ) in order to prevent runaway solutions with unphyiscal parameters ( e.g. , extremely broad lines ) .",
    ".x  ray spectral parameters of h1419 + 480 for the 2 - 12 kev fit .",
    "all errors are 90% confidence for 1 interesting parameter . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at the 6  resolution of this setup , the civ doublet ( @xmath28 ) is unresolved and , obviously , we can not measure directly the absorbing column density .",
    "fig  [ cog_civ ] shows the curve of growth ( i.e. , equivalent width versus column density ) for the whole civ doublet and a range of velocity dispersion parameters . as usual",
    "a voigt profile has been assumed for each line in the doublet , with velocity width parameter @xmath29 ( @xmath5 is the velocity dispersion of the gas , assumed maxwellian ) , damping constant @xmath30 and a _ total _ oscillator strength of 0.28 ( which is the sum of the oscillator strengths for the two lines ) .",
    "the approximation introduced by whiting ( 1968 ) to the voigt profile ( accurate to better than 5% ) has been used .",
    "1548,1550 doublet ( continuous lines ) .",
    "velocity dispersion parameters @xmath29 ( @xmath5 is the velocity dispersion of the gas ) range from 20 to 200 @xmath31 in steps of 20 @xmath31 from bottom to top .",
    "the dotted lines show the measured equivalent width formal 90% confidence interval.,height=302 ]     @xmath321216 transition ( continuous lines ) .",
    "velocity dispersion parameters as in fig .",
    "[ cog_civ ] .",
    "the dotted line shows the adopted 3@xmath5 upper limit for the detection of this line in the _ iue _ spectra.,height=302 ]    the amount of civ absorbing gas is very uncertain , as the measured equivalent width falls in the saturated part of the curve of growth , but values around @xmath33 would be appropriate for doppler velocity parameters around @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "[ cog_lya ] we also plot the curve of growth for hi ly@xmath3 , using an oscillator strength of 0.416 and a damping constant of @xmath35 , along with the upper limit of @xmath36 .",
    "we can see that relatively large hi column densities ( up to @xmath37 ) could go undetected for similar values of the doppler velocity parameter .",
    "establishing a link between the x - ray and the uv absorbing gas is difficult in this case , as the observations are not simultaneous .",
    "we can , however , test whether or not it is plausible that the same or a similar amount of gas ( perhaps in a different ionisation state ) produced both absorption features .",
    "the x - ray absorbing gas has a fairly well determined column of @xmath9 and it is highly ionized ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "its velocity with respect to the emission redshift is only poorly defined by the epic data but consistent with zero .",
    "the absorber was significantly weaker or absent in the 1992 @xmath1 observation .",
    "the uv gas detected as a civ associated absorber in the 1982 _ iue _ observation of h1419 + 480 , has a fairly well determined outflowing velocity of @xmath39 , but its civ column density is only poorly constrained @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "no hi ly@xmath3 of mgii absorption are found , although the _ iue _ spectra at the ly@xmath3 region are noisier than around the civ and mgii lines .",
    "the total column density implied by the civ absorption is    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the fraction of c which is in @xmath44 ionisation state .",
    "indeed this is a completely unknown parameter , as we can not determine the ionisation parameter of this gas which applies to the 1982 observation from a single uv unresolved absorption feature .",
    "we must restrict ourselves to check whether a value of @xmath45 , as in the x - ray absorber , can be obtained for reasonable ionisation conditions .    using xstar ( version 2.1 )",
    "we have computed ionization fractions for civ ( @xmath43 ) , hi ( @xmath46 ) and mgii ( @xmath47 ) for a range of values of @xmath48 , assuming the gas temperature fixed at @xmath49 and with a spectral shape given by a @xmath50 power law . as pointed out by , e.g. ,",
    "mathur et al ( 1994 ) this might result in a very inaccurate shape of the uv ionizing continuum and instead a more accurate shape should be used .",
    "however , for the purposes of this illustrative exercise , where the ionising parameter is essentially unknown , this rough modelling of the ionising spectrum is good enough .",
    "for this range of parameters , @xmath43 ( @xmath46 ) decreases from @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) for @xmath53 to @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) for @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath47 is zero for this range of ionisation .",
    "if we adopt the amount of gas seen in the x - ray absorber ( @xmath45 ) , hi ly@xmath3 would be difficult to detect in all the explored range of ionisations , as the hi column density would be below @xmath57 .",
    "however , @xmath58 would range from @xmath59 for the lower ionisation states explored down to @xmath60 in the opposite extreme . in conclusion , there is a range of ionisation parameters , in fact with values around those measured from the x - ray absorber ( @xmath61 ) , where it is plausible to observe the civ absorption line and no hi ly@xmath3 or mgii absorptions .",
    "a slightly higher ionisation brings also the civ absorption below detection limits .",
    "the bright seyfert 1 galaxy h1419 + 480 has been shown to be variable in x - rays by comparing our _ xmm - newton _ observations with earlier @xmath1 data .",
    "a warm absorber is clearly seen mostly through ovii absorption , but also with @xmath62 evidence for oviii absorption , in the _ xmm - newton _ data at the emission redshift .",
    "the absorber was weaker or absent in a @xmath1 pointed observation performed in 1992 .",
    "the absorber contains a gas column of @xmath63 , and the ionisation parameter is around @xmath64 depending on whether or not ionisation by collisions is included .",
    "an _ iue _ observation of h1419 + 480 conducted in 1982 shows @xmath65 detection for a civ associated absorber , outflowing with a velocity @xmath66 .",
    "this confirms the close link between x - ray ionized absorbers and uv associated absorption reported , among others , by crenshaw et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "this absorption line was not present in an _ iue _ observation obtained roughly 1 year later .",
    "we find that a plausible common origin for all these variable absorption phenomena can be understood in terms of the same ( or similar ) amount of photoionised gas , but with varying ionisation state . indeed , for values of the ionisation parameter similar to those inferred from the x - ray observations , we find that the x - ray absorbing gas could have produced the civ absorption feature without any detectable hi ly@xmath3 or mgii lines",
    ". a slightly higher ionisation would explain the lack of the civ absorption feature in the _ iue _ observation in 1983 .",
    "we therefore conclude that h1419 + 480 has a variable ionised absorber .",
    "both x - ray and associated uv absorbers are detected at different epochs in this object , along the lines of the sample studied by crenshaw et al .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that both absorbers are plausibly related .",
    "h1419 + 480 was observed in the 4.2 m william herschel telescope at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in the island of la palma ( canary islands , spain ) , on february 26 , 1998 .",
    "we used the isis double spectrograph with 600 line / mm gratings on both the blue and red arms , with the wavelengths centered at 5200 and 7000 respectively , in order to observe the h@xmath67+[oiii ] region in the blue and the h@xmath3+[nii]+[sii ] in the red .",
    "weather conditions were good and probably photometric , but the seeing was around 1.5 arcsec .",
    "two 300 sec observations ( co - added in the reduction process ) were carried out with the slit aligned to paralactic angle . for details on the reduction process ,",
    "see barcons et al ( 2003 ) as the same setup and procedure was used .",
    "[ optical ] shows the optical blue and red spectrum of h1419 + 480 .",
    "the [ oiii ] lines have some structure , with two peaks separated @xmath68 .",
    "this is the main limiting factor in the precission of the redshift , that we measure by fitting both lines to a common redshift and find @xmath69 .",
    "the work reported herein is based partly on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "it is also based on ines data from the _ iue _ observatory .",
