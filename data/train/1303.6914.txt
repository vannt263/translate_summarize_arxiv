    "the decomposition of tensors @xmath5 as a sum of _ simple _ tensors ( i.e. tensors of rank @xmath6 ) is a central problem for many applications of multilinar algebra to algebraic statistics , signal theory , coding theory and others .    for statistical inference ,",
    "it is meaningful to know if a probability distribution , arising from a model , uniquely determines the parameters that produced it .",
    "when this happens , the parameters are called _",
    "identifiable_. the notion of _ generic _ identifiability for parametric models has been considered in @xcite and in @xcite  2.2 .",
    "indeed , conditions which guarantee the uniqueness of this decomposition , for generic tensors in the model , are quite important in the applications .",
    "when generic identifiability holds , the set of non - identifiable parameters has measure zero , thus parameter inference is still meaningful .",
    "notice that many decomposition algorithms converge to _ one _ decomposition , hence a uniqueness result guarantees that the decomposition found is the chased one .",
    "we refer to @xcite and its huge reference list , for more details .",
    "even from a purely theoretical point of view , the study of the decomposition shows some beautiful link between multilinear algebra and projective geometry .",
    "the present paper is devoted to study one intriguing special case , which shows an exceptional behavior .    among tensors",
    "@xmath5 whose rank has the generic value , only one example is known when we have identifiability , that is @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 . on the contrary ,",
    "general tensors whose rank is _ smaller _ than the generic value , often have a unique decomposition .    excluding the cases of matrices ( tensors of dimension @xmath10 ) , identifiability is known to hold when the rank @xmath4 is _ small_. an evidence is given for @xmath7 by the celebrated kruskal s bound @xcite , which , for general tensors of given rank , is refined and extended in a series of papers ( see strassen s paper @xcite , the recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "let s order the @xmath11 s so that @xmath12 . in @xcite corollary 8.4",
    "it was proved that , with the assumption @xmath13 , the variety @xmath14 is @xmath4-identifiable if and only if @xmath15 the general tensor of rank @xmath16 has not a unique decomposition . after this result , we say that a tensor is _ unbalanced _ if @xmath13 .",
    "this range is one unity larger than the corresponding unbalanced range considered in @xcite while studying the dimension of secant varieties of segre varieties ( see  8 of @xcite where these two notions were compared ) .    in the case",
    "@xmath17 the corresponding tensors are called _",
    "balanced_.    only few examples of balanced tensors , whose rank is smaller than the generic value , are known to be not generically identifiable .",
    "we mention the case of tensors of rank @xmath18 in @xmath19 ( @xcite ) and , in dimension @xmath3 , tensors of rank @xmath3 in @xmath20 ( classical , see @xcite  4 ) and tensors of rank @xmath2 in @xmath21 ( @xcite , theorem 1.3 ) .    a computer aided analysis ( see @xcite theor .",
    "7.5 ) shows that when the numbers @xmath11 s grow , sporadic examples disappear , and we expect that a general balanced tensor , of rank smaller than the generic value , is identifiable .    the present paper is devoted to illustrate one sporadic example , which we believe should be the last one , for balanced tensors of dimension @xmath7 .",
    "namely , we use a geometric approach to show that general tensors of rank @xmath0 in @xmath22 are not uniquely decomposable .",
    "notice that tensors of the mentioned type have generic rank equal to @xmath23 .",
    "the proof of the non - uniqueness is based on the weak - defectivity principle , classically introduced by terracini ( @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the introduction of @xcite for an account of the geometric reduction of the problem .    in details , we prove that through @xmath0 general points of the segre variety @xmath24 , which corresponds to simple tensors in @xmath22 , one can find a special fourfold @xmath25 which is the segre - veronese image of @xmath26 , embedded by forms of type @xmath27 .",
    "since through a general point of the span @xmath28 of @xmath25 one can find many linear @xmath29-spaces which are @xmath0-secant to @xmath25 , then by @xcite theorem 2.9 , it follows the weak defectivity and the non identifiability of our tensors .",
    "the example is interesting also because the subvariety @xmath25 , which produces the non - identifiability of tensors of rank @xmath0 in @xmath22 , is quite complicate .",
    "in particular , we are unable to estimate how many @xmath0-secant spaces to @xmath25 are there through a general point of the span @xmath28 . consequently , we are unable to determine how many different decomposition are there , for a general tensor @xmath30 as above .",
    "we simply know that the number is finite , and at least @xmath2 .",
    "let us mention that , from the geometrical point of view , the existence of the subvariety @xmath25 through @xmath0 general points of @xmath24 is proved by some ",
    "ad hoc  argument .",
    "a complete theory of special subvarieties that one can find through general points of segre varieties , seems actually far beyond our reach .",
    "for basic facts about the geometric point of view on tensors we follow @xcite .    given any irreducible projective variety @xmath31 , we denote by @xmath32 the @xmath4-th secant variety of @xmath31 , that is the zariski closure of the set @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath32 is indeed the zariski closure of the set of elements having @xmath31-rank equal to @xmath4 .    in the space @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , the ( projectification of the ) cone @xmath31 of simple tensors corresponds to the embedding of @xmath36 , via the segre map .",
    "the ( projectification of the ) cone of tensors of rank @xmath4 is an open dense subset of the secant variety @xmath32 .",
    "we recall from @xcite def .",
    "2.1 the following    @xmath31 is called @xmath4-identifiable if the general element of @xmath32 has a unique expression as the sum of @xmath4 elements of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , in our notation , we say that @xmath36 is @xmath4-identifiable if the general tensors in @xmath37 of rank @xmath4 has a unique decomposition as a sum of simple tensors .",
    "a complete list of known segre varieties @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , for which a computer based algorithm does not prove the @xmath4-identifiability , is provided in @xcite ,  5 , see also @xcite  7 .",
    "the list corresponds to the case of tensors of dimension @xmath3 , for which the algorithm can not prove the uniqueness of the decomposition .    in all the examples , except for two of them ,",
    "it is indeed well known that general tensors of rank @xmath4 have infinitely many decompositions .",
    "the two remaining cases are listed below :    @xmath40    in the first case , the effective proof that @xmath31 is not @xmath2-identifiable ( and the general tensor of rank @xmath2 has exactly @xmath41 decompositions ) is contained in @xcite , theorem 1.3 .",
    "the latter case needs an  ad hoc  analysis which is the target of the present note .",
    "our main tool is to prove the existence of particular , very degenerate subvarieties @xmath25 , through @xmath4 general points of the segre variety @xmath38 .    indeed , we recall the following :    [ inverseweak ] let @xmath31 be a projective , irreducible non  degenerate variety of dimension @xmath42 in @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that for any general @xmath4-tuples of points @xmath45 one can find a subvariety @xmath25 of pure dimension @xmath46 containing the points @xmath47 , whose span has dimension @xmath48 assume that @xmath49 and moreover assume that through a general point of @xmath50 one finds @xmath51 @xmath4-secant @xmath52-linear spaces .",
    "then @xmath31 is not @xmath4-identifiable . indeed through a general point of @xmath32 one finds at least @xmath53 @xmath4-secant @xmath52-linear spaces .",
    "it is essentially theorem 2.9 of @xcite .",
    "from this point on , we focus our attention to the vector space @xmath54 of tensors of type @xmath1 , which has dimension @xmath55 . from the projective point of view",
    ", simple tensors in @xmath54 corresponds to points of the segre embedding of @xmath24 into @xmath56 .",
    "we also fix the rank @xmath57 , i.e. we consider the eighth secant variety @xmath58 . we know that @xmath31 is not @xmath0-defective , so that @xmath58 has projective dimension @xmath59 ( see @xcite ,  5 ) .",
    "this means that the subvariety ( cone ) of tensors of rank @xmath0 in @xmath54 has the expected dimension @xmath60 .",
    "[ p1p2 ] fix eight general points @xmath62 of @xmath63 and fix eight general points @xmath64 of @xmath65 .",
    "then there exists a segre embedding @xmath66 for which the line @xmath67 contains @xmath68 for all @xmath69 .",
    "in other words , each @xmath68 lies in @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the projection @xmath73 .",
    "the embeddings @xmath74 are parametrized by the quotient group @xmath75 , which has dimension @xmath76 .",
    "since the eight points @xmath68 are general , we have an @xmath0-dimensional family @xmath77 of embeddings @xmath78 for which @xmath79 . since the unique automorphism of @xmath65 which fixes four general points is the identity , as @xmath78 varies in @xmath77 , the family of @xmath61-tuples @xmath80 dominates @xmath81 .",
    "since the group @xmath82 acts transitively on the points @xmath83 , it follows that the orbit of the set @xmath84 , under @xmath85 , dominates @xmath86 .",
    "the claim follows .",
    "we send @xmath26 to the three factors @xmath65 , @xmath63 and @xmath63 , by using the identity on @xmath65 and divisors @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "thus , we need to prove that we can arrange this map @xmath90 so that the image passes through @xmath0 general points of @xmath31 .",
    "the choice of eight general points in @xmath24 corresponds to the choice of @xmath0 general points in each factor . by the previous lemma , for a general choice of points @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we can find divisors @xmath94 , which define segre embeddings @xmath95 of @xmath96 into @xmath63 , for which each @xmath68 ( resp .",
    "each @xmath97 ) lies in the line @xmath67 ( resp .",
    "@xmath98 ) .",
    "the following lemma would be easy , provided one knows a table of @xmath61-dimensional varieties in @xmath28 , whose @xmath0-th secant order is different from @xmath6 .",
    "since the table is missing , we need to compute directly what happens for the segre product @xmath26 .",
    "[ nooass ] let @xmath25 be an embedding of @xmath26 into @xmath28 , through a divisor of type @xmath27 .",
    "then through a general point @xmath102 one can draw at least @xmath2 spaces of dimension @xmath29 , which are @xmath0-secant to @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the tangential projection from the tangent spaces at @xmath29 general points @xmath103 of @xmath25 , which is a rational map @xmath104 . by the theorem 4.2 ( vi ) of @xcite we have that the number of seven dimensional spaces which are @xmath0-secant to @xmath25 and contain a general point @xmath102 is @xmath105 , for a general choice of points @xmath103 .",
    "so it is enough to show that @xmath106 .",
    "a computer based algorithm , implemented in m2 @xcite , which is available in the ancillary files of the arxiv submission of this paper , shows that there exists a 7-uple @xmath107 and a point @xmath108 such that the fiber @xmath109 consists of @xmath2 reduced points .",
    "consider the rational map @xmath110 induced by the tangential projection .",
    "that is @xmath111 then , after resolving the indeterminacy of the map @xmath112 , we get , from the stein factorization , that the general fiber of @xmath112 consists of six points , so that @xmath106 .",
    "computer experiments show that the base locus of @xmath113 consists of @xmath114 lines for @xmath115 ( each tangent space at a point @xmath116 meets @xmath25 in two lines ) and consists of @xmath117 lines plus @xmath61 extra points for @xmath118 .",
    "we do not know how to prove theoretically the existence of these @xmath61 points in the base locus .",
    "fix @xmath0 general points @xmath120 and a general point @xmath121 , so that @xmath122 is a general point of the @xmath0-th secant variety of @xmath31 . by lemma [ p1p1p2 ] ,",
    "the eight points are contained in the image @xmath123 of a segre - veronese embedding of @xmath26 through a divisor of type @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath25 spans a @xmath28 , which clearly contains @xmath122 , and @xmath122 is a general point of @xmath28 . by lemma [ nooass ] , one finds @xmath2 linear spaces of ( projective ) dimension @xmath29 , which are @xmath0-secant to @xmath25 and contain @xmath122 .",
    "since these spaces are also @xmath0-secant to @xmath31 , the claim follows .",
    "unfortunately , we can only conclude that there are _ at least _",
    "@xmath2 decompositions .",
    "one reason is that the lower bound with @xmath125 considered in the proof can be strict .",
    "for example , if @xmath25 is the @xmath0-veronese embedding of @xmath65 , then ranestad and schreyer prove ( see theorem 1.7 ( iv ) of @xcite ) that a general polynomial of degree @xmath0 has exactly @xmath126 decompositions as the sum of @xmath127 powers of linear forms . on the other hand ,",
    "the tangential projection from @xmath117 points has base locus given by the @xmath117 points themselves and so its degree is @xmath128 .",
