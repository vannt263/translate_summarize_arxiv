    "crystalline materials often have highly singular strain fields at crack tips , dislocations , and grain boundaries that require the accuracy of atomistic modeling only in small regions surrounding these defects .",
    "however , these localized defects interact through long - ranged elastic fields with a much larger region where the strain gradients are sufficiently small to allow accurate and efficient approximation by coarse - grained continuum finite element models .",
    "this has motivated the development of numerical methods that couple atomistic regions with continuum regions to compute problems with length scales that are sufficiently large for accurate and reliable scientific and engineering application  @xcite .    the quasicontinuum energy ( qce )  @xcite couples an atomistic model to a finite element continuum model based on the cauchy - born strain energy density .",
    "the cauchy - born strain energy density reproduces the atomistic energy density for a uniformly deformed lattice .",
    "the qce atomistic - to - continuum coupling also reproduces the atomistic energy density for a uniformly deformed lattice simply by modifying the volume of the triangles or tetrahedra within the cut - off radius of the boundary of the atomistic region by using the voronoi cell  @xcite .",
    "the qce energy remains the most popular quasicontinuum energy since the modification of the volume of the triangles near the interface to reproduce the atomistic energy density can be explicitly achieved and has been implemented in the code  @xcite for multi - dimensional problems with many - body potentials .",
    "a quasicontinuum energy is said to be _ patch test consistent _ if it reproduces the zero net forces at each atom for a uniformly deformed lattice .",
    "the fully atomistic and cauchy - born energies are patch test consistent by symmetry , but the symmetry is broken in the qce atomistic - to - continuum interface .",
    "the nonzero forces in the qce atomistic - to - continuum interface of a uniformly deformed lattice are called _ ghost forces _  @xcite .    the _ ghost force correction method _ ( gfc ) was developed to improve the accuracy of qce  @xcite , and it has been shown to converge to the patch test consistent force - based quasicontinuum method ( qcf )  @xcite .",
    "gfc has been implemented in the code  @xcite and further developed to utilize the efficiency of atomistic - to - continuum modeling and continuum mesh _ a posteriori _",
    "adaptivity  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that the force - based quasicontinuum method ( qcf ) gives a non - conservative force field  @xcite , so the stability of a deformation that satisfies the qcf equations can not be simply determined by checking whether it is a local minimum of a quasicontinuum energy  @xcite .",
    "the linearization of the qcf method has also been shown to be indefinite and to have unusual stability properties  @xcite which presents a further challenge to the notion of stability and to the development of efficient and reliable iterative methods  @xcite .",
    "the potential for more reliable and efficient iterative solution methods and more direct extensions to finite temperature dynamical methods  @xcite make energy - based quasicontinuum methods more desirable than force - based quasicontinuum methods .",
    "several quasicontinuum energies have been proposed which satisfy the patch test for a limited class of problems , but a quasicontinuum energy that satisfies the patch test for many - body potential interactions in several space dimensions with general coupling interfaces and coarsening has yet to be developed .    the quasi - nonlocal energy ( qnl )  @xcite gives an explicit and implemented algorithm for close range interactions ( up to next - nearest neighbor interactions for a chain and up to fourth - nearest neighbor interactions for a fcc lattice ) by restoring the symmetry of the interactions .",
    "ghost forces remain for nonplanar interfaces and coarsening  @xcite .",
    "the geometric consistency approach gives geometric and algebraic conditions to allow finite range interactions , but an implemented algorithm has only been given for low index planar interfaces .",
    "an efficient and implemented algorithm has yet to be given for a general nonplanar interface surrounding a defect .",
    "ghost forces still remain for nonplanar interfaces and coarsening  @xcite .",
    "further , the generalization of the geometric consistency approach to three - dimensional problems seems to depend on special decompositions of three - dimensional space into congruent tetrahedra ( for example , the hexagonal lattice is such a special decomposition of two - dimensional space ) .",
    "the qce energy , on the other hand , can be implemented for any decomposition of three - dimensional space into tetrahedra ( see ( 21 ) in  @xcite ) , and so can the blended quasicontinuum energy ( bqce ) which we propose below . in fact , a code for the bqce energy can be obtained by simply modifying any qce code and suppressing the coarsening in the blending interface .",
    "we have done that for our two - dimensional qce code  @xcite .",
    "the bqce code will then be able to utilize any adaptive atomistic - to - continuum and continuum coarsening features of the qce code .",
    "more recently , generalizations have been given for the explicit extension of the qnl energy to allow finite range interactions  @xcite .",
    "the consistent a / c coupling  @xcite gives an implemented patch test consistent quasicontinuum energy for two - dimensional problems with general pair potential interactions , atomistic - to - continuum coupling interface , and coarsening .",
    "no generalizations of these or other patch test consistent methods to three - dimensional crystals , multi - lattices , or multi - body potentials are yet known .",
    "since there remain important problems for which no patch test consistent methods are known , we feel it is important to develop general strategies for reducing the error of coupled energies which can be applied to a broad class of methods and problems .",
    "we propose that by blending the atomistic and corresponding cauchy - born continuum energies of qce in an interfacial region with thickness of a small number @xmath0 of blended atoms , a blended quasicontinuum energy ( bqce ) can be developed with the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of the qce energy near lattice instabilities such as dislocation formation and motion .",
    "this blended quasicontinuum energy can be implemented for any problem for which a qce energy has been developed , and we think that most existing codes for qce could be easily modified to implement bqce .",
    "the blended quasicontinuum energy is not patch test consistent , but our error estimates in section  [ subsec : modeling ] show that the error due to the ghost force can be reduced significantly by optimizing the blending function over a blending region of small size @xmath7 therefore , we think that the use of bqce is a good strategy for reducing the error of qce when applied to problems for which no patch test consistent methods are known . moreover , patch test consistent quasicontinuum methods tend to be more complicated and more difficult to implement than qce .",
    "thus , even for problems for where a patch test consistent quasicontinuum energy is known , we think that the bqce energy remains an attractive quasicontinuum energy .",
    "the bqce method is similar to many other methods in which atomistic and continuum energies are smoothly blended over an interfacial region , with some features specific to the quasicontinuum setting .",
    "we call such a region a _ blending region _ , and we call such a method a _ blended _ method .",
    "( other authors call the blending region a  handshake region \" , an  interface \" , a  bridging region \" , or an  overlap \" . )",
    "we call the weights which blend the atomistic and continuum contributions to the energy _ blending functions_. for example , the atc coupling  @xcite , the bridging domain method  @xcite , and the arlequin method for coupling particle and continuum models  @xcite are all energy - based blended methods which are similar to bqce . by contrast ,",
    "in other schemes , the atomistic and continuum models are coupled abruptly across a sharp interface consisting of only a few atoms .",
    "such schemes include the energy - based quasicontinuum ( qce ) method  @xcite , the quasinonlocal quasicontinuum ( qnl ) method  @xcite , the generalized qnl method  @xcite , and the consistent a / c coupling  @xcite .    in this paper , we present an error analysis of the blended quasicontinuum energy ( bqce ) .",
    "we determine precisely how the error of the bqce method depends on the size of the blending region and how it depends on the blending functions .",
    "we analyze the accuracy of bqce applied to the problem of a one - dimensional chain of atoms with periodic boundary conditions and a next nearest neighbor pair interaction model .",
    "our choice of a one - dimensional analysis allows us to explicitly investigate the accuracy of the bqce energy for deformations up to lattice instability  @xcite , which is crucial for the computation of critical strains in lattice statics as well as for the computation of the dynamics of defect nucleation and movement .",
    "we focus on modeling error and do not consider coarse - graining in our analysis . instead",
    ", we assume that the continuum energy is a cauchy - born energy discretized by piecewise linear finite elements with nodes at every atom .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for an analysis of coarse - graining for a problem similar to our one - dimensional chain .",
    "in addition , we constrain the displacements of atoms in the blending region to exactly match the continuum displacement field . in some other methods , the displacements of atoms in the blending region are coupled weakly to the continuum displacement field using lagrange multipliers or a penalty method .",
    "this is the case in the arlequin method  @xcite , in the bridging domain method  @xcite , and in some implementations of the atc coupling  @xcite .",
    "computational experiments comparing various methods of weak coupling are given in  @xcite .",
    "a numerical analysis of a mixed finite element method for a weakly coupled problem is given in  @xcite .",
    "blending can also improve the accuracy of quasicontinuum energies which are more accurate than qce , but may not satisfy the patch test for general interactions , nonplanar interfaces , or coarsening .",
    "we thus also define and analyze a blended generalization of qnl which we call the _ blended qnl _ ( bqnl ) energy .",
    "the bqnl method is an energy - based , blended coupling which passes the patch test for the one - dimensional problem analyzed in this paper , but does not generally satisfy the patch test as described above .",
    "our analysis extends the techniques developed in  @xcite for the patch test consistent qnl to obtain precise estimates of the error for bqce , which does not satisfy the patch test .",
    "most importantly , our estimates can be used to optimize the blending function and blending interface size of bqce to obtain accurate solutions up to lattice instabilities .",
    "our error estimate in theorem  [ thm : a priori existence for bqce ] shows that the @xmath1 strain error for the bqce method can be reduced by a factor of @xmath4 where @xmath0 is the number of atoms in the blending region .",
    "this result is suggested by the results of  @xcite on the decay of the coupling error for qce .",
    "it has been shown that the qce method suffers from a o@xmath5 error in the critical strain at which the lattice loses stability ( which models fracture or the formation of a defect )  @xcite .",
    "we prove in theorem  [ thm : aprstab ] that the error in the critical strain of bqce can be reduced by a factor of @xmath6 where @xmath0 is the number of atoms in the blended interface region . in remark",
    "[ rem : ghost force ] , we use our modeling error estimates to derive blending functions for the bqce method which minimize the error due to the ghost force .",
    "we give our _ a priori _ error estimate for bqnl in theorem  [ thm : a priori existence for bqnl ] . in theorem",
    "[ thm : a priori existence for bqnl ] , we show that the @xmath1 strain error for the bqnl method can be reduced by a factor of @xmath8 . we prove in theorem  [ thm : aprstab ] that the bqnl method does not suffer from a critical strain error .",
    "we begin by presenting a model of a one - dimensional lattice of atoms .",
    "our reference configuration is the integer lattice @xmath9 with lattice spacing @xmath10 .",
    "the admissible deformations are n - periodic , mean - zero displacements of uniformly strained states of @xmath9 .",
    "precisely , for @xmath11 , we let @xmath12 be the set of n - periodic , mean - zero displacements . for @xmath13",
    "we let @xmath14 be the uniformly deformed state with _",
    "macroscopic strain _",
    "@xmath15 , and we let @xmath16 be the set of admissible deformations with fixed macroscopic strain @xmath15 .",
    "we will fix @xmath17 throughout the remainder of the paper , so that the reference length of a period is one , independently of @xmath18 . for notational convenience",
    ", we have let the deformations @xmath19 be functions of @xmath20 instead of @xmath9 even though we still think of @xmath9 as the reference configuration .",
    "we also remark that the  displacements \" @xmath21 which appear in the definition of @xmath22 are not displacements measured relative to the reference lattice @xmath9 , but are instead displacements relative to the uniformly deformed state @xmath23 .    in the language of mechanics",
    ", one would say that our choice of the deformation space @xmath22 means that we have imposed  periodic boundary conditions with macroscopic strain @xmath15 . \"",
    "periodic boundary conditions are mathematically similar to dirichlet boundary conditions in that constraints are applied to the space of admissible deformations . in our case ,",
    "the constraint is given by the macroscopic strain @xmath15 which models the macroscopic scale stretching or contraction of the chain .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are useful because they eliminate surface effects near the boundaries of the chain .    for a deformation @xmath24",
    "we define a _ stored energy per period _ which we call @xmath25 .",
    "our stored energy @xmath25 sums the energies of all the interactions between first nearest neighbors and second nearest neighbors in the lattice .",
    "we compute the energies of interaction using a potential @xmath26\\rightarrow{\\mathbb r}$ ] which we assume satisfies    1 .",
    "@xmath27 , { \\mathbb r});$ ] 2 .",
    "there exists @xmath28 so that @xmath29 for all @xmath30 , and @xmath31 for all @xmath32 3 .",
    "@xmath33 and its derivatives decay at infinity .",
    "examples of commonly used interaction potentials which satisfy the above conditions include the lennard - jones potential and the morse potential .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath34 in  , we call the terms of the form @xmath35 _ first nearest neighbor interactions _ , and we call terms of the form @xmath36 _ second nearest neighbor interactions_.    the reader will observe that we have scaled the energy by @xmath18 and the interatomic distances by @xmath37 .",
    "this is done for two related reasons .",
    "first , quasicontinuum methods are only needed when when @xmath38 is large ( equivalently , when @xmath18 is small ) . by introducing the scaling above",
    ", we are able to distinguish those parts of the error which are most significant in the practically relevant limit of large @xmath38",
    ". the reader should bear this in mind when interpreting our error estimates in sections  [ subsec : modeling ] ,  [ subsec : stability ] , and  [ subsec : a priori existence ] .",
    "second , we desire that in the limit as @xmath18 tends to zero ( equivalently , as @xmath38 tends to infinity ) , the atomistic energy converges to the fully continuum cauchy - born energy  .",
    "this is explained in detail in section  [ subsec : cauchy born approx ] below . roughly speaking",
    ", this ensures that the atomistic energy is compatible with the continuum energy to which it is coupled in the bqce and bqnl schemes .",
    "the compatibility of the two energies is reflected in the fact that the modeling error of the cauchy - born energy   is of order @xmath39 ( see remark  [ rem : clarification of modeling ] ) .",
    "now suppose we want to model the response of our lattice to a dead load .",
    "we let @xmath40 denote the algebraic dual of @xmath41 , and we equip the space @xmath41 with the _ @xmath42 inner product _ given by @xmath43 generally speaking , a dead load @xmath44 should be thought of as an element of @xmath40 . however , since @xmath41 is a hilbert space with the inner product  , any @xmath45 is represented by some @xmath46 .",
    "that is , for any @xmath45 there exists @xmath46 so that for all @xmath47 , @xmath48 . thus , we will think of dead loads as elements of @xmath41 .    the total energy for an atomic chain subject to a dead load @xmath46",

    "we will say that a solution @xmath19 of the minimization problem   is _ strongly stable _ if @xmath54>0 $ ] for all @xmath55 , and we will call a deformation @xmath56 an _ equilibrium _ if it solves @xmath57 = < f , y > \\mbox { for all } u \\in \\mathcal{u}.\\ ] ]      we call an energy @xmath58 _ local _ if it can be written in the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb r}$ ] is called a _",
    "strain energy density_. otherwise , we say that an energy is _",
    "nonlocal_. observe that energy   is nonlocal .",
    "the development and use of a strain energy density @xmath33 allows coarse - graining in the continuum region by utilizing the full range of algorithms , codes , and analysis developed for the continuum finite element method .",
    "( an alternative quasicontinuum approach uses quadrature to approximate the nonlocal coarse - grained energy without the construction of a strain energy density  @xcite .",
    "peridynamics offer another promising fully nonlocal approach to coarse - graining  @xcite . )",
    "thus , it is useful to devise local energies which approximate  .",
    "the key to developing such energies is to observe that as long as @xmath61 varies slowly between neighboring lattice points , we have @xmath62 if we replace the second nearest neighbor terms @xmath63 by @xmath64 in  , we then obtain the _ cauchy - born energy _",
    "@xmath65 which is a local energy commonly used to approximate  .",
    "an alternative derivation of the cauchy - born energy is as follows .",

    "now suppose that @xmath75 is in the lagrange @xmath76 finite element space on @xmath68 $ ] with nodes at the reference position of each atom ; so the nodes are @xmath77 for @xmath78 . in that case",
    ", it is easy to show that @xmath79 thus , we see that the cauchy - born energy @xmath80 is a finite element approximation of the fully continuum cauchy - born energy @xmath72 .",
    "consequently , we will refer to @xmath80 as a  continuum \" energy .",
    "we say that the energy @xmath80 is not coarse - grained since @xmath80 has the same number of degrees of freedom as the atomistic energy @xmath81 : both depend on the deformed position of each atom .",
    "suppose we want to approximate a solution to the minimization problem   which has defects in localized regions but which is smooth throughout most of the lattice .",
    "efficiency requires that most of the lattice be modeled using the cauchy - born energy  , while accuracy requires that the defects be treated using the nonlocal energy  .",
    "thus , we desire a coupling of the two models .",
    "we distinguish two approaches to deriving coupled energies .",
    "we call these the _ strain - energy based _ approach and _ bond based _ approach . in the strain - energy based approach ,",
    "one first defines an atomistic _ energy per atom_. for our one - dimensional chain , an appropriate energy per atom is @xmath82 we call @xmath83 the _ atomistic energy at atom @xmath84_. observe that @xmath83 is half the total energy of all bonds involving atom @xmath84 , so @xmath85 .",
    "the energy per atom should be interpreted as the energy per length @xmath18 at atom @xmath84 ; thus , @xmath86 is analogous to a continuum strain - energy density .    to define a coupled energy we now blend the atomistic energy per atom with the continuum energy",
    "schematically , we choose some blending functions @xmath87 \\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] and @xmath88 $ ] . then for a deformation @xmath89 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb r}$ ] with corresponding atomistic deformation @xmath90 , we define @xmath91 } \\alpha(x ) \\psi^{cb } \\left ( \\frac{dy}{dx}(x ) \\right ) dx + { \\epsilon}{\\sum_{\\xi = 1}^n}\\beta_\\xi \\phi^a_\\xi(y^{\\epsilon}).\\ ] ] in equation  , one should imagine that the function @xmath92 is zero in a small region containing any defects , and one throughout the bulk of the lattice .",
    "one should imagine that @xmath93 is one near defects , and zero throughout the bulk of the lattice .",
    "for an abruptly coupled energy , one should imagine that @xmath92 is the characteristic function of the continuum region , and @xmath93 is the characteristic function of the atomistic region . by contrast , for a blended energy , one should imagine that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are more smooth .",
    "the energy - based quasicontinuum ( qce ) method  @xcite , the bridging domain method  @xcite , and the arlequin method  @xcite all take essentially the form  .",
