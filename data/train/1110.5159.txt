    "in this paper , we present a multigrid preconditioner for the linear system arising from piecewise linear nonconforming crouzeix - raviart ( cr ) discretization of the following second order elliptic problems with jump coefficients : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is an open polygonal domain and @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 is piecewise constant , namely , @xmath6 is a constant for each ( open ) polygonal subdomain @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "developing efficient multilevel solvers / preconditioners for the cr discretization is not only important for its own sake , but it has several important applications . in particular , it can be used to develop efficient solvers for other discretizations of .",
    "for example , by using the equivalence between cr discretization and mixed methods ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the preconditioners for cr discretization can be applied to solve mixed finite element discretizations for ( see @xcite for the multigrid algorithms in the case of smooth coefficients ) .",
    "this relationship is also used in @xcite to analyze multigrid algorithms for mixed finite element discretization on adaptively refined meshes .",
    "another important application is on the design of efficient multilevel solvers for interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( ipdg ) methods ; we refer to @xcite for the poisson problem , and to @xcite for with jump coefficients .",
    "a lot of work has been done to develop multilevel solvers and preconditioners for the piecewise linear cr discretization of in the context of smooth ( or constant ) coefficients .",
    "multigrid algorithms were developed and analyzed in @xcite , and two - level additive schwarz preconditioners are presented in @xcite .",
    "hierarchical and bpx - type multilevel preconditioners were proposed in @xcite , and their optimality was shown in @xcite .",
    "most of the aforementioned works define the multilevel structure using the natural sequences of nonconforming spaces .",
    "since these nonconforming spaces are non - nested , special intergrid transfer operators ( restriction and prolongation ) are needed in the analysis and implementation of the algorithms .    on the other hand , we observe that the standard piecewise linear conforming finite element space is a proper subspace of the cr space on the same triangulation .",
    "therefore , one may be able to reduce the nonconforming discretization to the conforming one for which efficient and robust multilevel solvers / preconditioners are available . due to the nested nature of the finite element spaces",
    ", one can also apply the standard multilevel analysis .",
    "moreover , in the implementation of the algorithms one does not need special intergrid transfer operators ; instead one could just use the natural inclusion operators . in this article",
    ", we propose a multigrid preconditioner for solving cr discretization , which consists of a standard smoother ( gauss - seidel , or jacobi iterative methods ) on the fine nonconforming space and standard multigrid solver on the conforming subspaces .",
    "the only difference between this algorithm and the standard multigrid algorithm on conforming spaces is the prolongation and restriction operators on the finest level .",
    "since the spaces are nested , the prolongation is simply the natural inclusion operator from the conforming space to the cr space .",
    "some preliminary numerical results of this paper has been reported in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the idea of using conforming subspace as preconditioner for cr discretization in the context of smooth coefficients has been used in @xcite , and @xcite for jump coefficient case .",
    "this article could be thought as an extension of the results in @xcite , where a bpx - type ( additive ) multilevel preconditioner for cr discretization was developed , and was applied to solve the whole family of interior penalty dg discretizations ( both symmetric and nonsymmetric ) for .",
    "no analysis on multiplicative multilevel preconditioner was given in @xcite . in this article",
    ", we discuss the robustness of a multiplicative preconditioner , the multigrid @xmath0-cycle preconditioner .",
    "the analysis of the algorithm relies on some technical tools developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show that the convergence rate of multigrid @xmath0-cycle algorithm will deteriorate rapidly due to large jump in the coefficient . on the other hand",
    ", we also show that the preconditioned system has only a fixed number of small eigenvalues deteriorated by the jump of the coefficients and mesh size , and the other eigenvalues are bounded nearly uniformly .",
    "therefore , the resulting multigrid preconditioned pcg algorithm is robust with respect to the coefficient @xmath11 and nearly optimal with respect to the mesh size @xmath12 .",
    "although the proof technique is similar to that in @xcite for the conforming case , we observe a major difference in the conclusion in theorem  [ thm : vp ] when @xmath13 . in the conforming case ,",
    "the condition number of @xmath14 wo nt deteriorate due to the coefficients when @xmath13 , as was pointed out in ( * ? ? ?",

    "based on the standard pcg theory , the convergence rate of pcg algorithm can be bounded as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the initial guess , @xmath79 is the solution sequence , and @xmath80 is the ( generalized ) condition number of @xmath14 .    this convergence rate is not sharp , in particular , when @xmath14 contains some extreme eigenvalues .",
