    "oxide heterostructures with a polar discontinuity across interfaces have attracted a great deal of attention recently , due to the unusual electronic behavior that can arise.@xcite it is now becoming evident that heterostructures with non - polar interfaces can also lead to unanticipated behavior , including low energy dispersion that is distinct from any previously known system . the specific example is the @xmath15/@xmath16 interface system tio@xmath13/vo@xmath13 that displays a point fermi surface , from which semi - dirac dispersion@xcite emerges .",
    "semi - dirac dispersion is characterized by conventional , massive dispersion along one direction in the two - dimensional plane but massless dispersion in the perpendicular direction .",
    "although reminiscent of graphene , the semi - dirac system displays its own distinctive low energy properties.@xcite the behavior is actually an electron confinement phenomenon assisted by a particular orbital ordering , and these nanostructures display a peculiar metal - insulator transition@xcite as the thickness of the d@xmath17 oxide is increased . in these rutile structured oxides ,",
    "the metal - insulator transition takes place through an intermediate semi - dirac point when the thickness is approximately 1 nm , where the system is neither insulating nor conducting and the fermi surface is point - like .",
    "transition metal oxide perovskites with 3d@xmath17 configuration are known to be on the borderline between metallic and insulating , depending on the relative sizes of several electronic energy scales , including the ratio between the on - site coulomb repulsion u and the bandwidth w of the @xmath18 electrons , and the competition between magnetic energies and jahn - teller splittings . for small",
    "u / w , the material will be metallic , like the correlated metal@xcite srvo@xmath0 . for a large value of the ratio u / w , the system will present a more localized behavior , and a mott insulator will result , as in latio@xmath0 or ytio@xmath0.@xcite other energy scales may also affect , or even determine , the delicate balance .",
    "multilayers of srvo@xmath0 ( svo ) and srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) have been grown on sto substrates by kim _",
    "et al . _ and have displayed a transition@xcite from the typical insulating behavior of sto to the metallic behavior of svo as the number of layers of each constituent is increased .",
    "superlattices formed by films with 2 layers of sto and 6 layers of svo [ we will denote ( srtio@xmath0)@xmath1/(srvo@xmath0)@xmath2 ( 001 ) oriented multilayers as @xmath19 already show metallic behavior with a nearly flat resistivity curve with magnitude close to that of svo . however , from the behavior of the resistivity , it was observed that the 2/3 , 2/4 and 2/6 films ( increasing svo thickness ) show an insulator - metal transition at temperatures ranging from about 100 k for the 2/6 film to the approximately 230 k of the 2/4 and 2/3 films .",
    "it is to be noted also that only 2 layers of sto are not enough to isolate the svo slabs , as can be seen from the resistivity data for the 2/3 and 3/3 systems .",
    "in fact , the 2/3 system is already semi - metallic , but four layers of sto are enough to render interactions between neighboring svo slabs negligible .",
    "five svo layers are needed to obtain a metallic state , as we show below from our calculations .    in this paper",
    "we extend our investigations of @xmath15-@xmath16 nanostructures by studying this sto / svo system , focusing on the differences that the crystal structure , with its specific crystal field splittings , can cause .",
    "we choose the most commonly studied structure , perovskite , with the previously studied nanostructures with rutile crystal structure",
    ". we will compare different orbital orderings and magnetic arrangements , and also study how the insulator to metal transition occurs with increasing thickness of the @xmath16 material ( srvo@xmath0 ) .",
    "our electronic structure calculations were performed within density functional theory @xcite using the all - electron , full potential code wien2k @xcite based on the augmented plane wave plus local orbital ( apw+lo ) basis set @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential utilized for the structure optimizations was the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite . to deal with strong correlation effects that are evident in srvo@xmath0 we apply the lsda+u scheme @xcite including an on - site u and j ( on - site coulomb repulsion and exchange strengths ) for the ti and v @xmath20 states .",
    "the values u= 4.5 ev , j= 0.7 ev have been used for v to deal properly with correlations in this multilayered structure ; these values are comparable to those used in literature for d@xmath17 systems@xcite .",
    "our calculations show that a larger u , above 5.0 ev , give an incorrect insulating behavior of bulk srvo@xmath0 in cubic structure , hence overestimating electron - electron interactions .",
    "since ti @xmath18 states never have any significant occupation , including u or not on ti @xmath20 orbitals has negligible consequence .",
    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effects on the valence and conduction states , which is discussed in the last section , have been introduced in a second variational procedure built on the scalar relativistic approximation .",
    "we have first performed calculations on bulk srvo@xmath0 ( svo ) to establish the thick srvo@xmath0 limit of these nanostructures .",
    "experimentally , srvo@xmath0 is a ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal@xcite crystallizing in a cubic perovskite structure.@xcite no distortion from cubic structure has been observed experimentally , which is consistent to its metallic character ; a mott insulating @xmath16 system would be expected to distort due to orbital ordering .",
    "our calculations show that the most stable structure based on gga exchange - correlation ( not including on - site coulomb repulsion effects ) is cubic with no distortions .",
    "however , a non - magnetic solution is obtained as a ground state within gga .    when correlations are introduced by means of the lda+u method , the most stable structure is slightly distorted .",
    "this broken symmetry arises because the lda+u method tends to promote integer occupations of one of the @xmath21 orbitals ( which becomes lower in energy , and preferentially occupied ) .",
    "calculations were carried out with a tetragonal distortion in bulk srvo@xmath0 and with various values of the on - site coulomb repulsion u. lda+u calculations predict two possible orbital configurations : a fm configuration with all the t@xmath22 bands equally occupied and an af solution with a substantial occupation of the d@xmath23 orbital .",
    "as u increases above 5 ev , the af solution is more stable , even for undistorted cubic perovskite , leading to an incorrect af insulating state . in all ranges of u",
    "studied ( 3 to 7 ev ) , a tetragonal distortion is more stable , whereas a simple gga calculation leads to an undistorted cubic solution , in agreement with experiment . even in the case of a fm solution , when a u is introduced in the calculations ,",
    "a tetragonal distortion is obtained as a ground state , in disagreement with experimental observations . using the correct structure obtained from both experiment and gga calculations ( which agree ) ,",
    "the lda+u method with values of u smaller than 5 ev leads to the correct fm metallic state as ground state .    within gga ( u = 0 )",
    "svo is a cubic metal , with all the t@xmath22 orbitals are equally occupied . within lda+u ,",
    "a tetragonal distortion causes the preferential occupation of the d@xmath23 orbital , an insulating state and also an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering to be stabilized , whereas a cubic fm metallic state is observed experimentally .",
    "this is the case also when lda+u is applied for the structure relaxed with gga .",
    "for this reason , throughout the paper , we will use for structure optimizations of these multilayers including such a moderately correlated compound , the gga - pbe functional.@xcite with the structure thus determined , we use the lda+u method for the calculations of the electronic and magnetic structure , and energy differences . in bulk",
    "svo this procedure properly results in a fm half metal with 1 @xmath10/v atom .",
    "srvo@xmath0 has a lattice parameter of 3.84 ,@xcite while the lattice parameter of srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) is 3.90 .@xcite since most of these superlattices are grown on a srtio@xmath0 substrate , for closest comparison with experimental data we fix the @xmath24 lattice parameter to be the sto lattice parameter .",
    "however , we use the gga - pbe exchange - correlation potential to optimize the superlattice @xmath25 parameter and also the internal coordinates of all the atoms by a force minimization together with a total energy minimization .    since the if between svo and sto has no polar discontinuity , the distortions introduced at the interface between the two oxides by the nanostructuring can be understood as first , strain due to the lattice parameter mismatch ( 1.5% ) , and secondly , to charge imbalance within the v @xmath21 orbitals .",
    "however , no ionic charge compensation effects of the sort that are so interesting in laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 nanostructures are present.@xcite    we compare results for @xmath26 multilayers with @xmath27= 4 layers of sto ( about 1.6 nm thickness ) sandwiching an svo layer with variable thickness from 1 to 5 layers of svo ( 0.4 to 2.0 nm ) , because we find 4 layers of sto sufficient to isolate the svo slabs to give two - dimensional behavior ( negligible k@xmath28-dispersion in the band structure ) .",
    "we analyze the evolution of the electronic structure for increasing thickness of svo slabs ( @xmath12 from 1 to 5 ) .      .",
    "shown is a top view of the @xmath29 plane in the planar af mott insulator state , which is the most stable only at larger values of u. the d@xmath23 orbital is occupied on each v ion .",
    "different colors indicate different spin directions . ]",
    "one common feature within the svo sublayer for all thicknesses we have studied is that the v octahedral environment , especially at the interface ( if ) , will be tetrahedrally distorted from its cubic symmetry in the bulk .",
    "it was noted above that such a distortion , treated fully ( i.e. including structural relaxation ) within the lda+u method for reasonable values of u , produces an ( incorrect ) af insulator state for bulk svo . in the case of the multilayers ,",
    "our relaxation of the @xmath25 lattice parameter and atomic positions will lead to values of the interplane v - v distance somewhat smaller than the in - plane value .",
    "the simplest scenario would be that the multilayer structuring of svo on an sto substrate will produce a tetragonal distortion of the oxygen octahedra around the v cations .",
    "this @xmath25-axis contraction of the octahedra leads to a preferred occupation of the d@xmath23 orbital .",
    "if @xmath30 orbitals are occupied on all atoms in a layer , a small enough bandwidth or strong enough intra - atomic interaction u will give af ordering by superexchange .",
    "this effect is observed experimentally in similar multilayer systems with the d@xmath17 compound being a mott insulator like latio@xmath0.@xcite    a more realistic picture must allow for the likelihood that the degenerate @xmath31 orbitals will have a narrower bandwidth in the @xmath29 plane , and correlation effects may favor occupation of some combination of these orbitals .",
    "even though small , spin - orbit coupling breaks this degeneracy and specifies a favored combination . the actual occupation will depend on several factors .",
    "first of all is the tetragonal crystal field splitting of the @xmath21 orbitals . in all cases we study ,",
    "the @xmath32 on - site energy is lower due to in - plane stretching imposed by the sto substrate .",
    "second , the @xmath29 plane bandwidths of @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands are very different , and will depend on orbital order .",
    "thirdly , the orbital order is closely tied to the magnetic configuration of the system .",
    "the simplest possibility ( above ) , with all the electrons in an @xmath30 orbital , leads to af order ( this orbital pattern can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rho_4_2 ] ) , whereas we find that occupying @xmath31 orbitals favors fm order .",
    "the structural distortion as @xmath12 increases can be described in terms of lattice strain along the @xmath25-axis .",
    "relaxing the @xmath25-axis value ( and also the internal atomic positions ) yields the results provided in table [ tab_dist ] . for understanding the structural distortions , we can define four different distances along the @xmath25-axis ( within the plane they are constrained by the sto lattice parameter 3.905  ) : the v - v distance , the v - ti distance across the if , the ti - ti distance , and finally the average @xmath25 lattice parameter .",
    "we find that the ti - ti distance hardly changes , and also the v - ti distance variation is minor .",
    "however , the v - v distance grows towards a limiting value as the number of svo layers increases .",
    "both v - v and ti - ti interlayer distances presented in the table vary only by @xmath33 0.01   for the various layers within each n / m system .",
    ".interlayer distances (  ) between metal cations , for the various @xmath34 configurations under study .",
    "the important distances to describe the structure are ti - ti , ti - v ( across the interface ) , v - v , and the average c parameter .",
    "the ti - ti separations , and v - v separations , for each heterostructure are uniform to within 0.01  . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]      some general features should be established . due to the alignment of the srvo@xmath0 fermi level ( or gap ) within the srtio@xmath0 gap between filled o @xmath35 states and empty ti @xmath20 states , there is a 2.5 ev energy window which contains only the v @xmath18 bands that are of interest for us .",
    "the oxygen @xmath35 bands lie below the v @xmath18 bands .",
    "we note especially that we have used laterally enlarged , @xmath36 superstructures to allow the possibility ( or likelihood ) of af spin alignment as well as fm , and various orbital ordering patterns as well .",
    "the ground states we obtain and analyze are all lower in energy than any that would have been found in primitive @xmath37 cells .",
    "soc in the v atom usually produces minor effects , except for those which depend entirely on it ( such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy ) .",
    "we find here however , irrespective of the number of vo@xmath13 layers , that soc in conjunction with correlation effects ( the on - site repulsion u ) completely alter the ground state that we obtain .",
    "it has long been known that the @xmath21 subshell provides a representation for @xmath38=1 ( not @xmath38=2 ) orbital moments.@xcite the @xmath39 states are @xmath40 = @xmath30 , and @xmath41 .",
    "soc splits these , with @xmath42 ( @xmath8 ) lying lower .",
    "this viewpoint is not common , because the orbital moments are typically quenched by mixing with neighboring orbitals .",
    "fairly recently several cases have come to light in which @xmath21 orbital moments can be quenched@xcite by structure - induced or spontaneous symmetry lowering , or even in a @xmath43 system an orbital moment can compensate a spin moment and prevent orbital ordering.@xcite the calculations presented here provide an additional example of the importance of soc in @xmath20 systems .",
    "the strain in the slabs we study breaks the @xmath21 symmetry , with @xmath30 lying lower .",
    "strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy favors the magnetization along the @xmath25-axis ( by 130 mev / v compared to an in - plane orientation ) , making this the quantization axis",
    ". then one can expect competition between occupation of the @xmath42 and @xmath30 orbitals in a @xmath16 ion , with kinetic energy ( bandwidth and band placement ) being a determining factor .",
    "the energy gain , and thus the large magnetocrystalline anisotropy , is related ( see following sections ) to the formation of a large orbital moment 0.75 @xmath10 along the @xmath44-axis when the @xmath42 orbital is occupied .",
    "since the spin moment is reduced somewhat from its atomic value of 1 @xmath10 by hybridization , the net magnetic moment on such an ion can be quite small .",
    "in the next section we show that an alternating orbitally - ordered ( aoo ) state , with half the electrons in a @xmath30 orbital and the other sublattice in a @xmath45 orbital , arises and leads to fm spin alignment .",
    "the af solution becomes favored only at unphysically large values of u ( above 5 - 6 ev ) . in the reasonable range of values of u , this aoo state is energetically favored for several svo slab thicknesses .",
    "this aoo , mott insulating fm state competes and overcomes the mott - insulating af state , which has all the electrons in @xmath32 orbitals .",
    "unexpectedly , when soc is included , the alternating orbital ordering produces an fm mott insulating state at small srvo@xmath0 thicknesses , below 2 nm , and for realistic values of u for this multilayered system .",
    "it is instructive to follow the behavior through the insulator - to - metal transition with svo thickness .",
    "when a single layer of svo is confined by insulating sto , the resulting strain lowers the @xmath30 orbital energy , and it should be expected that a candidate ground state is @xmath30 `` orbitally ordered '' af insulator due to superexchange .",
    "indeed this nel state can be obtained in our calculations , for the moderate range of u that is relevant .",
    "the coupling arises through @xmath46-type hopping between @xmath30 orbitals in the plane ( see fig . [ rho_4_2 ] ) as expected from goodenough - kanamori - anderson ( gka ) rules.@xcite however , the aoo phase with fm spin alignment was also obtained , and it is lower in energy by 4 mev / v .",
    "the two sublattices lead to distinct sets of bands , as easily seen from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ bs_4_1 ] .",
    "the @xmath30 band has the familiar square - lattice shape ( distorted somewhat by 2nd neighbor coupling , and is 1.5 ev wide .",
    "the @xmath47 bands are much narrower ( 0.25 ev ) because there is only @xmath46 coupling .",
    "the centroid of the latter pair lies about 0.5 ev above that of the @xmath30 band , providing the magnitude of the splitting of the @xmath21 by strain .",
    "the system is metallic , with all three bands leading to fermi surfaces .",
    "the picture is completely changed by soc .",
    "figure [ bs_4_1 ] compares the majority spin band structure of the fm aoo state , first without soc , then with soc included .",
    "soc has no effect on the @xmath30 ( @xmath6 ) band .",
    "however , soc breaks the symmetry of the @xmath48 doublet , and the narrow bandwidth ( 0.25 ev ) compared to the value of u results in a mott insulating type of splitting of the @xmath42 and @xmath49 bands , by roughly @xmath33u .",
    "the soc - driven symmetry lowering is leveraged by the strong on - site interaction .",
    "the result is an aoo fm mott insulator with a gap of 0.6 ev .",
    "this @xmath42 orbital acquires a large orbital moment of about 0.75 @xmath10 , strongly compensating the spin moment .",
    "this motif of fm aoo v orbitals will recur for thicker svo slabs .",
    "the bands near the gap for the two svo layer slab are displayed in fig .",
    "[ bs_4_2 ] without soc included , to illustrate that for two layers there is already a band gap without soc , produced by interlayer coupling of @xmath31 states .",
    "however , soc produces the same orbital ordering and intralayer fm alignment as for n=1 , and the layers are also spin - aligned to give an overall fm aoo mott insulating state . comparing the total energy for the @xmath30 af state with the more stable fm state",
    ", the energy difference is found to be large , 76 mev / v .",
    "this energy difference includes the in - plane energy gain as for n=1 and the larger interplane stabilization due to a large dd@xmath50 coupling between d@xmath51 orbitals .",
    "as mentioned earlier , structural relaxation was always carried out using only the gga exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we note that for this n=3 case gga calculations give an afm interplane coupling ( up / down / up ) of fm layers .",
    "we carried out the structural relaxations in this magnetic structure ; however , the type of magnetic order is not expected to affect the relaxation appreciably .",
    "returning to the lda+u calculations to evaluate spin and orbital order , the ground state is fm overall ( up / up / up ) with aoo order within the plane , and a metallic band structure .",
    "as for n=1 and n=2 , in - plane afm ordering with all @xmath30 orbitals occupied can be obtained , but is energetically higher than the fm aoo state . in this case , we can compare the total energies of two configurations with the same in - plane orbital ordering , but different interlayer aoo alignment , aaa ( like orbitals aligned along the @xmath25-axis ) or aba .",
    "the aaa configuration is more stable by 6 mev / v , giving an idea of the strength of the interlayer coupling .",
    "soc again results in the same intralayer aoo fm state , however in this case there is an extremely small gap at @xmath52 , visible in fig .",
    "[ bs_4_3 ] .",
    "it differs from the n=2 system ( and is similar to the n=1 system ) in having a gap only when soc in included ( breaking the @xmath45 degeneracy that otherwise leaves half ( or partially ) filled bands ) .",

    "the four band pairs for the @xmath31 orbitals correspond to linear combinations of similarly shaped bands for each of the four layers .",
    "the band dispersion decreases from 0.7 ev for the lowest band to zero for the highest ( unoccupied ) bands . by using a simple tight - binding model with interplane coupling , the band ordering and hence the occupation of the bands",
    "is readily reproduced .     and @xmath42 orbitals is apparent , and also the interlayer orbital configuration .",

    "the strong effects of tetragonal strain ( symmetry breaking ) and soc ( further symmetry breaking ) are finally overcome by the increasing delocalization across the svo slab as the quantum confinement effects are eroded .",
