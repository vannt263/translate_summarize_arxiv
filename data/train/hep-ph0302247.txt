    "<S> recent calculations applying statistical mechanics indicate that in a setting with compactified large extra dimensions a black hole might evolve into a ( quasi-)stable state with mass close to the new fundamental scale @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> black holes and therefore their relics might be produced at the lhc in the case of extra - dimensional topologies . in this energy regime , hawking s evaporation scenario is modified due to energy conservation and quantum effects . </S>",
    "<S> we reanalyse the evaporation of small black holes including the quantisation of the emitted radiation due to the finite surface of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that observable stable black hole relics with masses @xmath1 would form which could be identified by a delayed single jet with a corresponding hard momentum kick to the relic and by ionisation , e.g. in a tpc .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1@xmath2#1    the idea of large extra dimensions ( lxds ) which was recently proposed in @xcite might allow to study interactions at trans - planckian energies in the next generation collider experiments . here , the hierarchy - problem is solved or at least reformulated in a geometric language by the existence of @xmath3 compactified lxds in which only the gravitons can propagate . </S>",
    "<S> the standard - model particles are bound to our 4-dimensional sub - manifold , often called our 3-brane .    </S>",
    "<S> the strength of a force at a distance @xmath4 generated by a charge depends on the number of space - like dimensions . for distances smaller than the compactification length @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , the gravitational interaction drops faster compared to the other interactions . for distances much bigger than @xmath5 gravity </S>",
    "<S> is described by the well known potential law @xmath6 . however , starting from @xmath7 the force lines are diluted into the extra dimensions resulting in a smaller effective coupling constant for gravity .    </S>",
    "<S> this scenario would lead to the following relation between the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath8 and the higher dimensional planck mass @xmath0 , which is the new fundamental scale of the theory @xmath9    the lowered fundamental scale would induce a vast number of observable phenomena for quantum gravity at energies in the range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the non - observation of these predicted features gives first constraints on the parameters of the model , the number of extra dimensions @xmath3 and the fundamental scale @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , this scenario would have major consequences for cosmology and astrophysics such as the modification of inflation in the early universe and enhanced supernova - cooling due to graviton emission @xcite . on the other hand , additional processes had to be expected in high - energy collisions @xcite : production of real and virtual gravitons @xcite and the creation of black holes at energies that can be achieved at colliders in the near future .    </S>",
    "<S> especially the possibility of black hole production in lxds at the lhc and from cosmic rays has received great attention @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> black holes produced in such interactions would be tiny and may decay on fm / c time scales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the decay of these objects ( black holes , p - branes , string balls ) could be studied in detail in the laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , very little is known about the final stages of black hole evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> extensive speculations about the final fate of black holes have been brought forward in the literature and will be discussed in detail later . </S>",
    "<S> the general notion is that a small black hole stops evaporating particles when its mass approaches the planck scale , resulting in the exciting possibility of forming a ( quasi-)stable relic . in this letter , we study a model for the radiation from small black holes assuming a geometrical quantisation of the emitted radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the quantisation of the radiation can lead to black hole relics of masses around 1 - 3 tev with small electric charge . </S>",
    "<S> those relics might be observable at the lhc .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the properties of black holes which may be accessible in the next generation colliders . </S>",
    "<S> a black hole which might be produced with @xmath10 tev would have a radius much smaller than the size @xmath5 of the lxds @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> one can neglect the periodic boundary conditions due to compactification and approximate the space - time to be spherically symmetric . for these black holes , </S>",
    "<S> the metric is given by the @xmath11 - dimensional schwarzschild metric @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> following ref.@xcite and implying the extra dimensions via eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ master ] ) , the schwarzschild radius is given by @xmath12 the metric takes the familiar form @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the surface element of the @xmath15-dimensional sphere , containing @xmath16 angles and @xmath17 given by @xmath18 from this one gets the surface gravity : @xmath19 which is the newtonian force at the horizon in the schwarzschild case . </S>",
    "<S> the surface of the black hole is @xmath20 with @xmath21 denoting the surface of the unit @xmath22-sphere @xmath23    the production cross section for black holes in parton - parton or @xmath24 collisions can be estimated on geometrical grounds and is of order @xmath25 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> detailed studies to support this estimate can be found in the recent works by jevecki and thaler@xcite and by eardley and giddings@xcite . assuming the validity of the classical approximation and setting @xmath26  tev and @xmath27 one finds @xmath28  tev@xmath29  pb . the luminosity of pp interactions at the lhc would then allow the production of approximately @xmath30 black holes per year @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fate of these small black holes is difficult to estimate . </S>",
    "<S> there final evaporation is closely connected to the information loss puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> the black hole emits thermal radiation , whose sole property is the temperature , regardless of the initial state of the collapsing matter . </S>",
    "<S> so , if the black hole completely decays into statistically distributed particles , unitarity can be violated . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when the initial state is a pure quantum state and then evolves into a mixed state @xcite .    when one tries to avoid the information loss problem two possibilities are left . </S>",
    "<S> the information is regained by some unknown mechanism or a stable black hole remnant is formed which keeps the information . besides the fact that it is unclear in which way the information should escape the horizon @xcite there are several other arguments for black hole relics @xcite :    * the uncertainty relation : the schwarzschild radius of a black hole with planck mass is of the order of the planck length . since the planck length is the wavelength corresponding to a particle of planck mass , a problem arises when the mass of the black hole drops below planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> then one has trapped a higher mass , @xmath31 , inside a volume which is smaller than allowed by the uncertainty principle @xcite . to avoid this problem , </S>",
    "<S> zeldovich has proposed that black holes with masses below planck mass should be associated with stable elementary particles @xcite * corrections to the lagrangian : the introduction of additional terms , which are quadratic in the curvature , yields a dropping of the evaporation temperature towards zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this holds also for extra dimensional scenarios @xcite and is supported by calculations in the low energy limit of string theory @xcite . * further reasons for the existence of relics </S>",
    "<S> have been suggested to be black holes with axionic charge @xcite , the modification of the hawking temperature due to quantum hair @xcite or magnetic monopoles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coupling of a dilaton field to gravity also yields relics , with detailed features depending on the dimension of space - time @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now compare the classical micro - canonical emission scenario to an approach that takes into account the effects of the geometrical quantisation of the emitted radiation . </S>",
    "<S> note that this approach is different from a quantisation of the event horizon . in the present model </S>",
    "<S> , all horizon configurations can still be realized .    </S>",
    "<S> generally , black holes emit particles via the hawking mechanism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the radiation is : @xmath32 with @xmath33 given by ( [ kappa ] ) . from dimensional aspects we expect the entropy to be @xmath34 . from thermodynamics we know that , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is interpreted as the conserved energy of the system .    inserting eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ssr ] ) , ( [ kappa ] ) and ( [ tempkappa ] ) one obtains a mass dependence of @xmath37 with the exponent @xmath38 . integration yields @xmath39 in the limit where the energies of the emitted particles are small compared to the mass of the black hole the grand - canonical ensemble can be used . </S>",
    "<S> the number density of particles with energy @xmath40 is then @xmath41 with which one derives the higher dimensional analogue of the stefan - boltzmann law @xcite @xmath42 the spectrum of the emitted radiation has a maximum at frequencies of the order of the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when the mass of the black hole approaches the planck scale , the energy of the emitted quanta can no longer be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested in the late evaporation stage , when the black hole is small and hot , an appropriate statistical description is given by the micro - canonical ensemble @xcite . here , the single - particle number density is given by @xmath43}}{{\\rm exp}[s(m)]}\\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes the entropy of the black hole .    </S>",
    "<S> let us shortly examine the limit of huge black hole masses in the micro - canonical approach . </S>",
    "<S> the limit of the grand - canonical number density is wien s limit , i.e. @xmath45 . in the micro - canonical case @xmath46 in leading order in @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , wien s limit is recovered .    </S>",
    "<S> next we investigate the multi - particle spectrum in the micro canonical description : @xmath48}{{\\rm exp}[s(m ) ] } \\quad,\\ ] ] with @xmath49 being the smallest integer next to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this cut - off assures that the total energy of the emitted quantum does not exceed the mass of the black hole . after substituting @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> one obtains for the total energy density which is radiated off by the black hole @xmath52 the evaporation rate per degree of freedom is given by @xmath53    fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dmdtq ] ( thin dotted lines ) shows the evaporation rate ( [ mdoteq ] ) as a function of the initial mass @xmath36 of the black hole . in the limit @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> , the micro canonical evaporation rate reproduces the hawking evaporation in @xmath15 space - like dimensions : @xmath55 which is , using ( [ tempkappa ] ) , @xmath56    now we address the model with geometrical quantisation of the emitted radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation of a black hole derived by semi - classical quantum field theory in curved space @xcite yields a black body spectrum in @xmath22 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> spherical symmetry is taken into account by making the usual separation ansatz for the wave equation : @xmath57    which factorizes the full wave function into an amplitude @xmath58 , a radial wave function @xmath59 and a set of spherical harmonics @xmath60 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 is an abbreviation for the occurring @xmath62 angles . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients in the multipole expansion suppress the energy emission in higher order harmonics , therefore we consider only the @xmath63 mode . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation is the usual one for massless particles @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions of the black body lead to a restriction of the possible momenta . that was discussed in ref . @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this results in a geometrical quantisation of the momentum spectrum @xmath65 as a consequence , the multi - particle spectrum ( [ mehrteil ] ) is modified , since the emitted particles have energies in integer multiples of a minimal energy quantum @xmath66 :    @xmath67}{{\\rm exp}[s(m ) ] }   \\theta\\left(m - l \\delta \\omega \\right ) \\quad.\\ ] ]    here the @xmath68-function cuts off the spectrum when the energy of one particle exceeds the mass of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density of the radiation is derived by summation over momentum space @xmath69    in the limit of large black hole masses @xmath70 one has @xmath71 and regains the continuous emission spectrum from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ epsq ] ) . the evaporation rate with respect to the geometrically quantised spectrum </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dmdtq ] ( thick lines ) and compared to the continuous spectrum case ( thin dotted lines ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the spacing of energy levels gets smaller with increasing @xmath36 , and whenever it is possible to occupy an additional level the evaporation rate exhibits a step . </S>",
    "<S> these steps naturally appear in spacings @xmath72  tev , because in the mass range of interest it is @xmath73  the exact value thereby depending on the number of extra dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> the evaporation process occurs in quantised steps . </S>",
    "<S> it can not proceed further when the lowest lying quantum state allowed exceeds already the mass of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> evaporation is halted at a finite mass value for a certain fraction of initial masses above the fundamental scale . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the transverse momentum spectra of the radiation is modified as compared with a simple extrapolation of the hawking formula to small masses : here the final quanta possess energies of the order @xmath74 , and not a continuous spectrum with @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> if the mass were slightly above the planck scale , it would still be possible for the black hole to emit a particle carrying away most of its energy . </S>",
    "<S> this might leave a stable relic with mass below planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> however , since physics below the planck scale is unknown , we can not be sure about the existence and properties of relics with masses below the fundamental scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the following we will focus on those relics with masses above the fundamental scale .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask for the spectrum of final relic masses @xmath76 depending on the initial mass @xmath77 of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> this relation is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ miniend ] for the case @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the most probable case is the exclusive emission of minimal energy quanta during the evaporation process , depicted by solid lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ miniend ] . </S>",
    "<S> black holes with @xmath79 are stable with @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of higher modes in the evaporation process , which becomes more important with increasing initial mass , is shown by the dashed and dotted lines . when going even further , to masses @xmath81 , the whole range of end masses would become accessible . because the black holes accessible at the lhc would have mainly masses slightly above @xmath0 , most of these black holes were stable with masses around @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> indirect constraints on the existence of black hole relics can be obtained from the decay of primordial black holes . </S>",
    "<S> their modified and dimension dependent energy spectrum influences observables , e.g. the cosmic microwave background and the baryogenesis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the black hole relics from primordial density fluctuations may be a candidate for dark matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> upper limits on the relative contribution of those relics to the critical energy density in the universe are on the order of @xmath82 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observation of relics in a collider experiment is of highest interest .    </S>",
    "<S> the final and most interesting question is : how could one observe these relics ?    * a black hole relic with a mass of @xmath83 tev would have a spectrum that just fails to allow for a last emission of a quantum ( cf . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ miniend ] ) . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , if its mass were increased only slightly by the energy @xmath84 , it would enable the black hole to evaporate again , emitting a high energetic quantum and leaving a tiny mass relic . </S>",
    "<S> this might result in a delayed flash of hard photons , leptons or qcd jets compared to the collision dynamics encountered at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of black holes evaporating in this manner can be estimated from the mass spectrum of black holes produced at the lhc and is @xmath85 for @xmath86  gev . </S>",
    "<S> note that relics from primordial black holes might also lead to observable air showers , if a black hole relic evaporates in the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> * a certain fraction of the black holes produced in parton - parton collisions would carry a small charge of order @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this might allow to identify the charged black hole relics , e.g. by ionisation in a time projection chamber . </S>",
    "<S> * the thermal evaporation spectrum would be much softer as expected in the literature @xcite which assumes total decay of tev black holes . </S>",
    "<S> however , the final stages would be governed by non - thermal particle emission .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarise , we have analysed the late stages of black hole evaporation , including the geometrical quantisation of the emitted radiation . in this model setting , the production of stable black hole relics would be possible at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> these relics may be observable in a late burst of jets if they capture additional energy . </S>",
    "<S> charged black hole relics may eventually be directly detected , e.g. in a tpc by ionisation . </S>"
