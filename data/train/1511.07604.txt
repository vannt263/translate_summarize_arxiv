    "the confirmation of the higgs with a mass @xmath1 gev at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite has marked the discovery of the last piece of the jigsaw for the standard model . at the same time , this raises significant questions on the cosmological evolution of the higgs .",
    "if we extend the standard model to higher energy scales , the quartic higgs coupling becomes negative beyond a scale @xmath2 gev , mainly contributed by the loop corrections from the yukawa coupling to the top quark  @xcite . at very large field values of the higgs",
    "lies the true minimum with negative planckian energy density , if extrapolated up to the planck scale , indicating that the electroweak vacuum is only metastable .",
    "this metastability is sensitive to the top quark mass : the current measurement of the top quark mass @xmath3 gev  @xcite excludes absolute stability at 99% confidence level  @xcite , while the lifetime of the electroweak vacuum is longer than the age of the universe  @xcite .",
    "that means , with a generic sub - planckian initial value of the higgs @xmath4 , it is very unlikely to find ourselves in the metastable electroweak vacuum @xmath5 unless the higgs is forced to stay near the minimum .",
    "even if the higgs is initially placed at the origin , during inflation  @xcite the picture could become different very easily if the energy scale of inflation is large enough . indeed , with the current bound at 95% confidence on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath6  @xcite ,",
    "it is not difficult to construct inflationary models with the hubble parameter @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "if the higgs is only coupled to the standard model particle species , it can be treated as an effectively massless scalar field in the inflationary era .",
    "then the higgs acquires quantum fluctuations of @xmath8 , so that it eventually settles down in the true minimum with large negative energy  @xcite .",
    "there are many ways to solve this problem by introducing some new physics beyond standard model .",
    "for instance , some new particle with a mass larger than top quark can change the running of the higgs self - coupling @xmath9 , and prevent it from becoming negative  @xcite .",
    "inflation with finite temperature caused by dissipative effects can also change the effective potential by thermal corrections and raise the vaccum with negative energy to a false one  @xcite . besides",
    ", higgs inflation with a non - minimal coupling to gravity can solve this problem similarly  @xcite .",
    "a simple way to make the higgs safe from instability during inflation is to introduce a large mass by a direct coupling to the inflaton , which makes @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the hawking - moss decay rate is suppressed by @xmath11 , while the coleman - de luccia decay rate is still neglegible  @xcite so that the evolution of the higgs towards the electroweak vacuum during inflation is very likely . however",
    ", this coupling can affect the evolution of the curvature perturbation during inflation , thus may leave distinctive features primordial power spectrum by resonant oscillations  @xcite .",
    "these potentially important effects have not been studied closely . by treating the coupling term as a perturbation to the standard equation of motion  @xcite , we can study in detail the impacts of the heavy higgs during inflation .",
    "this article is outlined as follows . in section  [ sec : classical ] , we first consider the classical background evolution of the higgs and the inflaton with a simple renormalizable coupling between them . then we show this oscillating background gives rise to logarithmic oscillations in the primordial spectrum . in section  [ sec : quantum ]",
    "we compute the contributions from the quantum fluctuations to the power spectrum , which is subdominant compared to the classical features .",
    "after briefly commenting on the prospects for collider search in section  [ sec : collider ] , we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "let us begin by invoking the lagrangian with a simple renormalizable term that directly couples the higgs and the inflaton quadratically , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the inflaton and @xmath14 is a positive coupling constant . for simplicity",
    ", we have set the vacuum expectation value of the higgs to zero , and used the quadratic chaotic potential for inflation .",
    "we can place an upper bound on @xmath14 by requring that the one - loop quantum correction to the inflaton potential from the higgs - inflaton coupling @xmath15 is sub - dominant .",
    "this gives @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the amplitude of the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath18 at the normalization scale and @xmath19 is the @xmath20-folding number of that scale from the moment of horizon crossing till the end of inflation .",
    "a lower bound on @xmath14 can be derived from the condition to stabilize the higgs during inflation . to see this , notice that for a specific value of @xmath13 , the maximum along the higgs direction is obtained from @xmath21 non - trivial solution only exists for @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 . for estimation",
    ", we may neglect the running of @xmath9 and take its mimimum value @xmath24 to get @xmath25 which gives the maximum value of the effective potential for a given @xmath13 as @xmath26 then the probability of the hawking - moss decay is @xmath27 with @xmath28 the suppression of this decay rate gives us a lower bound @xmath29 on the other hand , the coleman - de luccia decay rate is negligible  @xcite , similar to the one in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "first we assume that the quartic term of the higgs is always negligible , otherwise the entire picture is not different with standard model , and the instability catastrophe can not be avoided .",
    "then , we require that the higgs - inflaton coupling term dominate the potential when @xmath30 is large ( but still sub - planckian )",
    ". the universe will not inflate in the beginning for large initial values of @xmath30 , and inflation only happens later when @xmath30 drops down some critical value and the inflaton potential becomes dominant . from , if @xmath31 the coupling term dominates around @xmath32 until @xmath33 , at which the inflation potential becomes larger so that inflation begins .",
    "if is violated , then @xmath34 and the inflaton potential will dominate throughout , leading to standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "we focus on the former case , and set the initial value of the higgs close to @xmath35 .",
    "the friedmann equation at this initial condition gives @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the initial value of @xmath13 .",
    "then the effective mass of the higgs , @xmath38 , can be then estimated as @xmath39 therefore in both cases the higgs can be treated as a massive scalar field .",
    "the dynamics of the background evolution is then as follows : when released from its initial value near the hilltop of the potential , the higgs fastly rolls down the potential along the @xmath30-direction , and oscillates in the valley around the electroweak vacuum .",
    "it will be trapped there after around 20 @xmath20-folds [ see and below ] .",
    "meanwhile the inflaton is always slowly rolling down the @xmath13-direction as will be discussed soon , and inflation happens only a few @xmath20-folds after @xmath40 .",
    "note that due to rapid oscillations , adopting the simple prescription of integrating out the higgs without taking into account the derivative operators  @xcite calls for caution .",
    "the pre - inflationary evolution can be treated as a matter dominated universe .",
    "it is convenient to make @xmath13 nearly frozen , which will be justified later soon .",
