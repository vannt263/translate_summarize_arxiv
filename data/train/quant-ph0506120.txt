    "the casimir force@xcite is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon arising from the modification of the zero - point oscillations of the electromagnetic field by material boundaries .",
    "it is in fact the limiting case of the well known van der waals force when the separation distances between the test bodies are large enough for the manifestation of retardation effects .",
    "the modern experimental study of the casimir force began in 1997 with ref .",
    "followed by refs .",
    ". this work was stimulated both by the demands of nanotechnology , where the casimir force may be large enough to drive nanoscale devices,@xcite and also by the theory of fundamental interactions , where the casimir effect plays a large role in testing the predictions of extra - dimensional physics.@xcite simultaneously with these new experiments , extensive theoretical work was carried out to refine calculations of the casimir force by taking into account numerous correction factors such as finite conductivity of the boundary metal , nonzero temperature , surface roughness , and patch potentials among others ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "beginning in 2000 , the behavior of the thermal correction to the casimir force between real metals has been hotly debated .",
    "it was shown that lifshitz theory,@xcite which provides the theoretical foundation for the calculations of both the van der waals and casimir forces , leads to different results depending on the model of metal conductivity used . for real metals at low frequencies @xmath1 , the dielectric permittivity @xmath2 varies as @xmath3 . after substituting @xmath4 into the lifshitz formula ,",
    "the result is a thermal correction which is several hundred times greater than for ideal metals at separations of a few tenths of a micrometer.@xcite the attempt@xcite to modify the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula for real metals , assuming that it behaves as in the case of ideal metals , also leads to a large thermal correction to the casimir force at short separations .",
    "it is important to note that in the approaches of both refs .   and also of ref .",
    "a thermodymanic puzzle arises , i.e. , the nernst heat theorem is violated for a perfect lattice.@xcite ( see also ref .   where it is shown that for the preservation of the nernst heat theorem in the approach of refs .",
    ",   it is necessary to have metals with defects or impurities ; it is common knowledge , however , that thermodynamics must be valid for both perfect and imperfect lattices . )",
    "this puzzle casts doubt on the many applications of the lifshitz theory of dispersion forces , and thus represents a potentially serious challenge to both experimental and theoretical physics .",
    "by contrast , the use of @xmath5 , as holds in a free electron plasma model neglecting relaxation , leads@xcite to a small thermal correction to the casimir force at short separations .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the case of an ideal metal and is consistent with the nernst heat theorem .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that the plasma model is not universal , and is applicable only in the case when the characteristic frequency is in the domain of infrared optics .",
    "a universal theoretical approach consistent with thermodynamics was proposed in ref .  .",
    "it uses the lifshitz formula with reflection coefficients expressed in terms of the surface impedance instead of the dielectric permittivity . in the framework of this approach",
    "one need not consider the zero - point and thermal photons inside a metal .",
    "the impedance approach was found to be consistent with the experimental results of ref .  , whereas the alternative approaches of refs .  ,   and ref .   were excluded by this experiment . it should be noted , however , that in refs .  ,   the contribution of surface roughness was rather large , and theory was compared with experiment by the use of the root - mean - square deviation ( a method previously used in experiments on the casimir force and criticized in literature@xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we carry out a precise experimental determination of the casimir pressure between two gold - coated parallel plates by means of a micromachined oscillator .",
    "in contrast to all previous experiments on the casimir force , the smallest experimental relative error ( in our case from 0.55% to 0.6% at 95% confidence ) was achieved not only at the shortest separations but rather in a wide separation range from 170 nm to 300 nm .",
    "the theoretical values of the casimir pressure were calculated in the framework of each of the aforementioned approaches , taking careful account of all relevant corrections .",
    "the error in the theoretical results was found independently of the experimental errors .",
    "the distinguishing feature of our present comparison of experiment with theory is that we do not use the root - mean - square deviation . instead",
    ", a rigorous metrological procedure is applied , which permits us to conclusively exclude the alternative approaches of refs .",
    " to the thermal casimir force , and to thus resolve the puzzle arising from the violation of the nernst heat theorem in these approaches .",
    "our results are used to strengthen constraints on non - newtonian gravity in the micrometer range by a factor of up to 20 , and to significantly increase their reliability .",
    "the details of the experimental setup containing the micromachined oscillator ( see fig .",
    "1 ) have already been presented in refs .  ,  .",
    "the vertical separation @xmath6 between the sapphire sphere of radius @xmath7 m and a @xmath8 heavily doped polysilicon plate ( both coated with gold ) was varied harmonically in time at the natural resonant frequency of the micromachined oscillator @xmath9hz . under the influence of the casimir force @xmath10 acting between a plate and a sphere , the resonant frequency shifts , and from the measurement of this shift",
    "one can calculate @xmath11 ( see refs .",
    ",  ) . using the proximity force theorem,@xcite we can then find the equivalent casimir pressure @xmath12 between the two parallel plates , i.e. , the casimir force per unit area .    in the present experiment the setup",
    "was significantly improved in several ways , which permitted us to obtain results which considerably exceed those of refs .  ,   in consistency and conclusiveness .",
    "first , the surface roughness was decreased by an order of magnitude on the sphere , and by a factor of five on the plate .",
    "this resulted in maximal heights of the roughness peaks equal to 11.06 nm and 20.63 nm , respectively .",
    "for the roughness characterization , the samples were studied with an afm both before and after the casimir force measurements .",
    "second , the error in the measurements of the absolute separation @xmath6 between the sphere and the plate was decreased from @xmath13 nm to @xmath14 nm at 95% confidence .",
    "the absolute separations were determined from @xmath15 ( see fig .  1 ) , where @xmath16 and the lever arm @xmath17 m .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is measured interferometrically , and @xmath19 is determined from the difference in capacitance between the plate and the right and left underlying electrodes .",
    "the value of @xmath20 nm was found from 120 plots of the electrostatic force as functions of separation at @xmath21 m ( where the casimir force is negligible ) for the given potential differences between a sphere and a plate .",
    "third , shorter separation distances between the sphere and the plate were achieved ( 160 nm instead of 260 nm ) owing to an improvement in detection sensitivity , and to a decrease of the coupling between the micromachined oscillator and the environment . in doing",
    "so we verified that the response of the micromachined oscillator was still linear .",
    "fourth , a gold coating was used on both test bodies ( instead of the dissimilar metals as in refs .  ,  ) which makes the theoretical interpretation of the final results more transparent . as a result",
    ", the casimir pressure @xmath22 was measured within a separation range from 160 nm to 750 nm .",
    "this measurement was repeated fifteen times with 288293 points in each run .",
    "each individual point was obtained with an integration time of 10s .",
    "the experimental data were analyzed for the presence of outlying results by the use of statistical criteria,@xcite and one of the fifteen sets of measurements was found to be outlying .",
    "all data from the remaining fourteen sets were plotted as a function of separation for separation distances between 160 nm and 750 nm , where the total separation interval was divided into partial subintervals of length @xmath23 nm each .",
    "the measurement data were carefully analyzed and found to be uniform in mean values , but not uniform in variance .",
    "because of this , the random error as a function of separation was found using a special procedure developed from the theory of repeated measurements.@xcite    the systematic errors in the casimir pressure determination were found to arise from the error in sphere radius @xmath24 m , and from the error in the angular resonant frequency @xmath25mhz . to obtain the total experimental error of our measurements ,",
    "it is necessary to combine the random and systematic errors which are described by the normal or student and uniform distributions , respectively .",
    "finally , the total relative experimental error as a function of separation was determined at 95% confidence ( see solid line in fig .  2 ) . as is seen from fig .",
    "2 , the smallest experimental error from 0.55% to 0.6% is achieved , not only at the shortest separation ( as in all previous casimir force measurements where the error was also larger ) , but in a wide range from 170 nm to 300 nm .",
    "this opens new opportunities to use our results for imposing stronger constraints on thermal effects and on hypothetical long - range interactions .",
    "in addition to performing the measurements , we calculated the equivalent casimir pressure acting between two gold - coated plates in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath26k using the lifshitz formula@xcite @xmath27^{-1}+ \\left[r_{\\bot}^{-2}(\\xi_l , k_{\\bot})e^{2q_lz}-1\\right]^{-1}\\right\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 and the summation is performed with respect to the matsubara frequencies @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath31 , and the prime adds a factor 1/2 for the @xmath32 term .",
    "the reflection coefficients @xmath33 also depend on the magnitude of a wave vector component in the plane of plates @xmath34 .    as was shown in ref .",
    ", in order for the lifshitz formula to avoid contradictions with thermodynamics for real metals , the reflection coefficients should be expressed in terms of the surface impedance @xmath35 : @xmath36 ^ 2 , \\quad r_{\\bot}^{-2}(\\xi_l , k_{\\bot})=\\left [ \\frac{z(i\\xi_l)cq_l+\\xi_l}{z(i\\xi_l)cq_l-\\xi_l}\\right]^2 . \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] the values of the impedance at all contributing imaginary matsubara frequencies with @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 ( which is the so called leontovich impedance@xcite ) , where @xmath39 is calculated by means of a dispersion relation from the tabulated@xcite complex refraction index of au ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "for the details of the calculation procedure ) . when the matsubara frequency is zero , the value of the impedance should be obtained@xcite by extrapolation from the region of characteristic frequencies , which is infrared optics in our case , resulting in @xmath40 when @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the plasma frequency . from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) one then arrives at @xmath43    the use of the leontovich impedance in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) which does not depend on the polarization state and transverse momentum , is of prime importance .",
    "note that in refs .  ,   the exact impedances depending on a transverse momentum were used .",
    "this has led to the same conclusions as were obtained previously from the lifshitz formula combined with the dielectric permittivity @xmath4 . as was already mentioned above",
    ", these conclusions are in violation of the nernst heat theorem for a perfect lattice.@xcite@xmath44@xcite although a recent review@xcite claims agreement with the nernst heat theorem in refs .  ,  , no specific objections against the rigorous analytical proof of the opposite statement in ref .   are presented .",
    "the fallacy in the calculations of refs .",
    ",   concerning the type of the impedance is that they disregard the requirement that the reflection properties for virtual photons on a classical boundary should be the same as for real photons . ref",
    ".   demonstrates in detail that by enforcing this requirement the exact and leontovich impedances coincide at zero frequency and lead to the conclusions of ref .   which are in perfect agreement with the nernst heat theorem .",
    "in fact , the exact impedances , depending on both polarization state and transverse momentum are@xcite @xmath45^{1/2 } , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\label{eq4a } \\\\ & & z_{\\bot}(\\omega , k_{\\bot})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon(\\omega ) } } \\left[{1-\\frac{c^2k_{\\bot}^2}{\\varepsilon(\\omega)\\omega^2 } } \\right]^{-1/2}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the angle of incidence @xmath46 of a plane electromagnetic wave with a wave vector @xmath47 from vacuum on the boundary plane of a metal is evidently given by @xmath48 .",
    "the important requirement is that the reflection properties of virtual photons on a classical boundary are the same as of real ones",
    ". in particular , the angle of reflection must be equal to the angle of incidence , i.e. , the first snell s law must be satisfied .",
    "this law follows from the fact that for reflection at a classical boundary , the mass - shell equation @xmath49 is valid leading to @xmath50 . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq4a ] ) and expanding in powers of a small parameter @xmath51 , we arrive at @xmath52^{1/2 } = z(\\omega)\\left[1-\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta_0}{2\\varepsilon(\\omega ) } + \\ldots\\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{eq4b}\\\\ & & z_{\\bot}(\\omega , k_{\\bot})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon(\\omega ) } } \\left[{1-\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta_0}{\\varepsilon(\\omega)}}\\right]^{-1/2 } = z(\\omega)\\left[1+\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta_0}{2\\varepsilon(\\omega ) } -\\ldots\\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the leontovich impedance .    in metals for all frequencies which are at least several times smaller than the plasma frequency @xmath53 holds .",
    "for this reason , the term @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq4b ] ) can be neglected in comparison with unity .",
    "an important point is that @xmath54 when @xmath55 , i.e. , at zero frequency the leontovich impedance precisely coincides with the exact impedances .",
    "this is in contradiction with refs .  ,  , where the limit @xmath55 was considered at fixed nonzero @xmath56 .",
    "the latter violates the mass - shell equation and , consequently , necessitates postulating some unusual reflection properties for virtual photons on a classical boundary . as a result ,",
    "the use of the leontovich impedance , which is in fact exact at zero frequency , is in agreement with thermodynamics , whereas the approach of refs .  ,   leads to the previous conclusions@xcite which are in contradiction with fundamental physical principles .",
    "the claims of ref .   against the extrapolation of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) to the zero matsubara frequency also collapse.@xcite as is shown in ref .",
    ", the alternative extrapolation , suggested in ref .  , leads to the unsupportable violation of the nernst heat theorem .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq2])([eq4 ] ) , the casimir pressures @xmath57 were computed within the measurement separation range",
    ". it can be seen@xcite that small sample - to - sample variations of the tabulated data for the refractive index due to , for example , differences in the grain size distribution and the presence of impurities , lead to a decrease in the magnitude of the casimir pressure which is much less than 0.5% even at the shortest separation @xmath58 nm considered here .",
    "note also that at separations @xmath59 nm the effects of spatial dispersion do not lead to any noticeable contribution to the casimir pressure.@xcite    the other correction factors which may influence the values of the theoretical casimir pressure are the surface roughness and patch potentials .",
    "the afm study of both interacting surfaces shows that the characteristic lateral size of the surface distortions is approximately 500600 nm , i.e. , a factor of three larger than the shortest separations in our experiment . in this case",
    "the roughness correction can be found@xcite by geometrical averaging,@xcite which leads to the conclusion that the largest roughness correction achieved here at the shortest separation ( @xmath58 nm ) is only 0.65% of the casimir pressure ( and 0.42% at @xmath60 nm ) .",
    "it is easily seen that the contribution of diffraction - type and correlation effects to the roughness correction , which can not be found by the additive method , is of order of 0.01% .",
    "the contributions of patch potentials , which are of the same order , and thus negligible , were found in analogy with ref .  .",
    "the values of the casimir pressure @xmath61 including roughness corrections were computed at all 4066 experimental points .",
    "we are now in a position to determine the error in the theoretical results .",
    "the main sources of errors are the proximity force theorem [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ] , which leads@xcite@xmath44@xcite to a relative error in the casimir pressure less than @xmath62 , and an uncertainty in the tabulated data for the complex refractive index leading to an error less than 0.5% .",
    "both of these errors in the pressure are approximately described by a uniform distribution .",
    "one should also take into account that , for purposes of comparison with experiment , the theoretical pressure is computed at the experimental points defined with an error @xmath63 . since the casimir pressure depends on the inverse fourth power of the separation , this leads@xcite to a relative error @xmath64 . combining the above three errors at 95% confidence",
    ", we obtain the theoretical relative error of the casimir pressure calculations shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 . as is seen from fig .  2 , at separations @xmath65 nm the experimental error is less than the theoretical error .    with independently determined experimental and theoretical errors at our disposal , it becomes possible to find the total absolute error of the new random variable @xmath66 $ ] at 95% confidence . in this way",
    "we avoid the use of the root - mean - square deviation between theory and experiment which was applied in previous casimir force measurements . in ref .",
    "this procedure was demonstrated to be inadequate when the force increases rapidly with the decrease of separation , although no alternative approach was proposed . in fig .",
    "[ expthkm ] the confidence interval @xmath67 $ ] is shown by the solid lines as a function of separation .",
    "in the same figure the differences between our theoretical and experimental casimir pressures are plotted by points for all fourteen sets of measurements .",
    "remarkably , only 207 points ( i.e. , 5.09% of the total number ) fall outside of the confidence interval , which demonstrates excellent agreement between our theory and experiment . the relative measure of agreement between theory and experiment is @xmath68 .",
    "this is equal to 1.9% at @xmath69 nm , 1.4% within the interval @xmath70 nm , 1.8% at @xmath71 nm , and then increases up to 13% at @xmath72 nm .",
    "thus our experiment is the first measurement of the casimir force where agreement between theory and experiment at the level of 1.5% has been achieved at high confidence within a wide separation region .",
    "this experiment , and the extent of agreement between our measurements and theory , can be used to test the alternative theoretical approaches to the thermal casimir force proposed in refs .",
    " , and to thus finally resolve the contradiction between these approaches and thermodynamics",

    "<S> we have performed a precise experimental determination of the casimir pressure between two gold - coated parallel plates by means of a micromachined oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to all previous experiments on the casimir effect , where a small relative error ( varying from 1% to 15% ) was achieved only at the shortest separation , our smallest experimental error ( @xmath0% ) is achieved over a wide separation range from 170 nm to 300 nm at 95% confidence . </S>",
    "<S> we have formulated a rigorous metrological procedure for the comparison of experiment and theory without resorting to the previously used root - mean - square deviation , which has been criticized in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to discriminate among different competing theories of the thermal casimir force , and to resolve a thermodynamic puzzle arising from the application of lifshitz theory to real metals . </S>",
    "<S> our results lead to a more rigorous approach for obtaining constraints on hypothetical long - range interactions predicted by extra - dimensional physics and other extensions of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the constraints on non - newtonian gravity are strengthened by up to a factor of 20 in a wide interaction range at 95% confidence . </S>"
