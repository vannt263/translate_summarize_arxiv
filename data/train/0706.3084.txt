    "we used observation cycles with integration times of 10  min on ngc  5253 and 1  min on the phase calibrator j1316 - 336 ( @xmath30  jy displaced by @xmath31 ) .",
    "two frequency windows ( los ) were used to observe the rrl h53@xmath0 , centered at 42885.1 and 42914.9  ghz . for each frequency window ,",
    "the on - source integration time was @xmath32  hrs , using the mode of 15 spectral channels with a channel separation of 3.125  mhz ( @xmath33  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the data calibration was carried out for each frequency window using the continuum channel , consisting of the central 75% of the band .",
    "the flux density scales were determined from observations of j1331 + 305 ( 3c286 ; 1.47  jy ) .",
    "the bandpass response of the instrument was corrected using observations of j1337 - 129 ( @xmath34  jy ) .",
    "the parameters of the observations are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the coordinates listed in this table  1 corresponds to the center of the observations . in order to track reliably the phase variations introduced by the troposphere",
    ", the calibration of the data was performed correcting for the phases in a first step and subsequently correcting for both amplitude and phase .",
    "the line data cubes were hanning - smoothed to reduce the gibbs effect and the final velocity resolution is @xmath35  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the line data were further calibrated using the solutions obtained by self - calibrating the continuum channel of each frequency window .",
    "the radio continuum images were obtained by combining the continuum channels of each frequency window using the task dbcon from aips , and the self - calibration method was also applied to this combined data .",
    "the continuum emission was subtracted for each frequency window using the aips task uvlsf with a zero order polynomial fit based on the line free channels .",
    "the h53@xmath0 line cubes and the 43 ghz continuum image were made using a natural weighting scheme and then convolved to obtain a circular gaussian beam of @xmath36 ( p.a.@xmath37 ) .",
    "the combination of the different frequency windows was carried out following a similar method to that used for the h53@xmath0 line observed toward m82 @xcite ; the two line cubes were combined into a single line cube after regridding in frequency the line data for each frequency window .",
    "this process was carried out using the gipsy reduction package and a total of 19 velocity channels were obtained after putting together the two lo windows .",

    "( 2002 ) , a single component that consists of optically thin free - free extended emission ( s @xmath42 ) does not explain the observed flux densities at frequencies @xmath43  ghz . an optically thick free - free component with an electron density of @xmath44  @xmath4 is necessary to explain the observed flux densities in the frequency range of @xmath45  ghz ; this optically thick free - free component has a turnover frequency at @xmath46  ghz .",
    "the electron density value of the compact ionized gas component was obtained based on high angular resolution radio observations and the fit is described in section 4.2 .",
    "there are at least three non - thermal components with angular sizes between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which only contribute about 2  mjy at 6  cm and 1 mjy at 2  cm ( see turner , ho & beck  1998 ) .",
    "turner , ho & beck  ( 1998 ) report three non - thermal sources based on observations at 2 and 6  cm , located near ( east , southeast and northwest ) the central super star cluster .",
    "thus , a third non - thermal ( s  @xmath49 ) component with s@xmath50  mjy has also been used in the fit of the total continuum emission shown in figure  1 .",
    "the flux density level of the extended optically - thin component is fit to the flux density values obtained from subtraction of the optically thick free - free and the synchrotron emission from the observed total flux densities .",

    "( 2003 ) we have assumed that the brightest source in the @xmath60 m nicmos can be identified with the radio peak as observed at an angular resolution of @xmath1 . we thus have shifted the nicmos image by @xmath62 in the ne direction in order that the ir and radio peaks coincide , consistent with the astrometrical precision of hst .",

    "previous observations have revealed that the radio continuum emission at 43 ghz is dominated by thermal free - free emission ( beck et al .",
    "1996 ) and our 43  ghz radio continuum observations suggest that the contribution from non - thermal emission is negligible at wavelengths shorter than 6  cm ( @xmath69  ghz , see figure  1 ) . thus , no contribution from synchrotron sources will be considered in the radio continuum emission models ( see section 4.2 ) .",
