    "in quantum theory , information about a physical system can not be obtained without affecting it because quantum measurement inevitably changes the state of the system via nonunitary state reduction .",
    "this property of quantum measurement is profoundly interesting for the foundations of quantum mechanics and is of practical importance in quantum information processing and communication  @xcite , such as in quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the subject of a tradeoff between information gain and state change has been discussed by many authors  @xcite over several years using various formulations .",
    "for example , banaszek  @xcite showed an inequality between two fidelities quantifying information gain and state change and ozawa  @xcite generalized heisenberg s uncertainty relation for noise and disturbance in quantum measurements .    on the other hand ,",
    "state change due to quantum measurement has been shown not to be necessarily irreversible  @xcite if the measurement preserves all the information about the system , though it was once widely believed to be irreversible such that one could not recover the premeasurement state from the postmeasurement one  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in a physically reversible measurement  @xcite , the premeasurement state can be recovered from the postmeasurement one with a nonzero probability of success via a second measurement , called a reversing measurement .",
    "reversible measurements have been proposed for various physical systems  @xcite and have been experimentally demonstrated using a superconducting phase qubit  @xcite and a photonic qubit  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to discuss not only the size of the state change but also its reversibility while considering the costs of information gain .",
    "intuitively , as measurements provide more information about a system , one would expect that more information would result in more change of a system s state along with reduced reversibility .",
    "moreover , whenever the reversing measurement recovers the premeasurement state of the first measurement , it erases all the information obtained by the first measurement ( see the erratum of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in a different type of reversible measurement , known as unitarily reversible measurement  @xcite",
    ", the premeasurement state can be recovered from the postmeasurement one with unit probability via a unitary operation although the measurement provides no information about the system . therefore , there are some tradeoffs among information gain , state change , and physical reversibility in quantum measurement .",
    "such tradeoffs have been studied in photodetection processes  @xcite and in single - qubit measurements  @xcite .",
    "these tradeoffs are at the level of a single outcome , in contrast to conventional ones  @xcite ; that is to say that the quantities affected are those pertaining to each single outcome , rather than those averaged over all possible outcomes .",
    "this characteristic is desirable for studying state recovery with information erasure in a physically reversible measurement , because it occurs not on average but only when the reversing measurement yields a preferred single outcome . on the other hand , using quantities averaged over outcomes , cheong and lee  @xcite demonstrated that a tradeoff exists between information gain and physical reversibility , which has been experimentally verified  @xcite using single photons .    in this paper",
    ", we present the general formulas for information gain , state change , and physical reversibility for an arbitrary quantum measurement on a @xmath0-level system in a completely unknown state . these formulas are more general versions of those for an arbitrary quantum measurement on a two - level system  @xcite and those for a projective measurement on a @xmath0-level system  @xcite .",
    "we present the evaluation of the amount of information gain by the decrease in shannon entropy  @xcite , the degree of state change by the fidelity  @xcite , and the degree of physical reversibility by the maximum successful probability of the reversing measurement  @xcite .",
    "the formulas are written using the singular values of a measurement operator corresponding to the outcome of the measurement .",
    "unfortunately , when some singular values are degenerate , the formula for information gain is not useful for numerical calculations due to apparent divergences .",
    "therefore , for the information gain , we show another formula that is free from apparent divergences , even when the singular values are degenerate .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : formulation ] explains the procedure for quantifying information gain , state change , and physical reversibility and shows their explicit formulas .",
    "section  [ sec : degeneracy ] deals with the degeneracy of singular values .",
    "section  [ sec : example ] considers a class of quantum measurements with highly degenerate singular values and discusses the tradeoffs among information gain , state change , and physical reversibility .",
    "section  [ sec : conclude ] summarizes our results .",
    "we first consider the amount of information provided by a quantum measurement . to evaluate this amount",
    ", it is first assumed that the premeasurement state of a system to be measured is known to be one of a set of predefined pure states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , each of which has an equal probability of @xmath3 , although the index @xmath4 of the premeasurement state is unknown .",
    "the lack of information about the state is then given by @xmath5 prior to measurement , where the shannon entropy has been used as a measure of uncertainty rather than the von neumann entropy of the mixed state @xmath6 because the uncertain information is the classical variable @xmath4 rather than the predefined quantum state @xmath7 .",
    "each state @xmath7 can be expanded in an orthonormal basis @xmath8 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath0 is the dimension of the hilbert space associated with the system . for the state to be normalized , the coefficients @xmath11 must satisfy the normalization condition @xmath12 since , in quantum measurements , the system to be measured is usually in a completely unknown state , the predefined states @xmath1",
    "are assumed to be all of the possible pure states of the system with @xmath13 .    a quantum measurement of the system",

    "each measurement operator @xmath21 can be decomposed by singular - value decomposition as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are unitary operators , and @xmath25 is a diagonal operator in the orthonormal basis @xmath8 : @xmath26 the diagonal elements @xmath27 , called the singular values of @xmath21 , are not less than @xmath28 by definition and are not greater than @xmath29 on the basis of eq .",

    "although it changes the state of the system as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reduction ] ) , the state change caused by @xmath23 can be recovered with unit probability and no information loss after the measurement by applying @xmath33 to the system .",
    "thus , to see the inevitable state change and irreversibility caused by the extraction of information , it suffices to set the measurement operator of eq .",
