    "globular clusters have long been noted to deviate , sometimes substantially , from perfect spherical symmetry @xcite . what is the reason why many globular clusters are non - spherical ?",
    "a conclusive answer to such an important question in the study of globular cluster dynamics , with potentially important ramifications in the study of the evolution of globular cluster stars @xcite , has so far not been conclusively established ( see * ? ? ? * for an extensive review and references ) .",
    "several possible causes of deviations of globular cluster shapes from sphericity have been suggested , including tidal stresses due to the presence of strong galactic tidal fields @xcite , gravothermal shocks during the passage of a cluster through the disk @xcite , velocity anisotropies , and internal rotation ( which may also be acquired by interaction with a massive galaxy ; lee et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the former two phenomena are now well documented , with a particularly impressive example being given by palomar  5 @xcite .",
    "the possibility that rotation may be the main driver of cluster ellipticities @xcite is supported by the @xcite and @xcite studies of @xmath3  centauri ( ngc  5139 ) , which are based upon a detailed analysis of its structural and dynamical profiles .",
    "yet , it still remains unclear , both from an empirical and from a theoretical perspective , whether rotation can be the main cause of flattening of globular star clusters .    on the observational side",
    ", we currently lack detailed velocity profiles for most globular clusters ; and even though we do have detailed rotational information for a few clusters , such as 47  tucanae ( ngc  104 ) , @xmath3  cen , m4 ( ngc  6121 ) and m15 ( ngc  7078 ) @xcite , the lack of a wider sample , as well as of reliable measurements of the variation in flattening as a function of radius for clusters encompassing the full range of observed ellipticities , has hindered further progress in establishing the general correspondence , or lack thereof , between flattening and cluster rotation .",
    "indeed , the latest catalogs of globular cluster ellipticities , published by @xcite and by @xcite , are entirely based on photographic data , consider exclusively the outermost cluster regions , and , relying on visual data , can be severely affected by differential reddening @xcite .",
    "our group is currently building a new , detailed catalog of globular cluster ellipticities , based on 2mass ( near - infrared ) data , which will greatly improve on the current situation @xcite .",
    "theoretically , too , the case for rotation as one of the main drivers of globular cluster ellipticity is far from being settled . in particular , @xcite has recently argued that globular clusters can rotate to very fast rates without deviating substantially from sphericity .",
    "this result is in contrast with those from @xcite , who instead were unable to produce models of fast - rotating globular cluster - like structures _ without _ an accompanying deviation from sphericity , in the sense that their modeled structures became lengthened along one or two axes , depending on the initial anisotropy of the velocity distributions .",
    "an ideal test , from an empirical viewpoint , of the impact of rotation on the shapes of globular star clusters , is to measure the rotation velocity of a highly flattened , isolated extragalactic globular cluster , where there is little possibility that tidal effects and/or gravothermal shocks may be responsible for its flattening .",
    "the closest possible approximation to such an isolated , flattened system is represented by the single , old globular cluster in the wolf - lundmark - melotte ( wlm ) dwarf irregular galaxy ( ddo 221 ) .",
    "while distant ( 885  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mass of the wlm galaxy is much smaller than even the lmc or smc , with @xmath4 of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively ( van den bergh 2000 ) , thus effectively ruling out the possibility that the non - spherical shape of the wlm cluster ( hereafter wlm-1 ) can be due to tidal effects or gravothermal shocks .",
    "note , in this sense , that this is not necessarily the case even in the magellanic clouds @xcite , where non - spherical globular clusters of all ages can be found ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we begin by reanalyzing archival hst wfpc2 data in section  [ sec : hstobservations ] , where we measure the ellipticity and surface brightness profiles of wlm-1 .",
    "we then discuss our new vlt uves observations and their reduction in section  [ sec : vltobservations ] , and attempt to measure the rotation ( section  [ sec : rotation ] ) and velocity dispersion ( section  [ sec : veldisp ] ) of wlm-1 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the possibility of velocity anisotropy in wlm-1 as a possible explanation for its observed morphology , and give some final remarks in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in order to measure accurate ellipticity and surface brightness profiles of wlm-1 , we have downloaded calibrated hst wfpc2 f814w and f555w images from the hst archive ( program go  6813 , pi p. w. hodge ) . in these images",
    "wlm-1 is centered on the pc chip .",
    "the only processing required was to combine the two images in each filter to reject cosmic rays .",
    "we also combined the images from different filters to reject the remaining few cosmic rays .",
    "this final image , rotated to put north at the top , is shown in figure  [ fig : wlm-1 ] .",
    "the ellipticity and position angle as a function of semi - major axis distance are measured with the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) routine ellipse , where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the semi - major and semi - minor axis lengths respectively .",
    "the position angle is the angle ( @xmath11 ) made by the major axis measured degrees east of north .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  [ fig : ellipticity ] .",
    "the mean ellipticities and position angles for our spectral extraction regions are listed in table  [ tab : ellipticity ] .",
    "lcc 0.1  0.5 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 + 0.5  1.0 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 + 1.0  1.5 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 + 1.5  5.0 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 [ tab : ellipticity ]    note that since there are many resolved stars in the hst image , there are many irregularities in the measurement of the ellipticity and position angle , especially at larger radii where these stars contribute a significant fraction of the total flux ( see discussion in navarro et al .",
    "2005 ) . also , when the ellipticity gets close to zero ( nearly circular ) , the position angle becomes poorly constrained and shows large fluctuations .",
    "the mean ellipticity of wlm-1 in the region @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "this ranks among the highest values among galactic globulars according to the lists tabulated by @xcite and @xcite , and only @xmath22 galactic globular clusters have ellipticities greater than this according to the recent analysis of 2mass data by navarro et al .",
    "it has previously been noted that lmc and smc globular clusters of all ages also have significant ellipticities , and in fact tend to be more elliptical than either galactic or m31 clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , suggesting an inverse relationship between galaxy mass and globular cluster ellipticity which would appear to be broadly consistent with the case of wlm-1 .",
    "however , @xcite have recently shown that the giant elliptical galaxy ngc  5128 , with @xmath23  mag @xcite , also contains a sizable population of flattened clusters .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xcite have suggested that , while galactic and m31 globular clusters shapes are broadly consistent with oblate spheroids , lmc and smc clusters are instead more consistent with triaxial ellipsoids .",
    "as well known , triaxiality is often accompanied by isophote twisting @xcite . in the case of wlm-1 ,",
    "we do find some interesting evidence that isophote twisting may indeed be present , but this is clearly restricted to the innermost @xmath24 of the cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipticity ] ) .",
    "we have independently measured the surface brightness profile on hst wfpc2 f555w ( @xmath25 ) and f814w ( @xmath26 ) images obtained from the hst archive .",
    "using the iraf ellipse task , with the ellipticity and position angle fixed at the mean values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , we measured the average flux in each elliptical annulus , which were then converted to surface brightness using the photometric zero points ( zp ) from the hst manual [ @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the data from the f555w filter are shown as points in figure  [ fig : sbprofile ] .",
    "finally we fit the surface brightness measurements with @xcite profiles using a chi - squared minimization algorithm and using the rms scatter in each annulus as an estimate of the measurement errors ( although this is actually a measure of the true range of flux values at any particular semi - major axis distance rather than a measure of how accurately one can measure the surface brightness ) .",
    "pixels within @xmath31 of the center of the cluster are saturated , and were therefore excluded from the fit .",
    "these excluded points are indicated by open circles in figure  [ fig : sbprofile ] .",
    "the resulting fits for each filter were then averaged together to give the final values .",
    "we find a best - fit core radius of @xmath32 , and a tidal radius of @xmath33 , where the magnitude of the errors is driven by the large scatter of fluxes in each annulus ( due to the resolved nature of the cluster population ) .",
    "the fitting also takes into account the background surface brightness ; the best fit values are @xmath34 mag / arcsec@xmath35 in f555w and @xmath36 mag / arcsec@xmath35 in the f814w filter .",
    "note that we have _ not _ taken into account the finite size of the hst psf , which has a nominal value of less than @xmath37 in both filters .",
    "assuming @xmath38 @xcite , one arcsecond corresponds to 4.28 parsecs at the distance of wlm-1 , and our measurements of the core and tidal radii convert to @xmath39  pc and @xmath40  pc .",
    "both of these values fall squarely in the range of parameters exhibited by galactic globulars : @xmath41 and @xmath42 with median values of @xmath43  pc and @xmath44  pc @xcite .",
    "this implies a very compact globular cluster , with @xmath45 . we can not discard the possibility of a collapsed core",
    "note that our measured half - light radius for the wlm-1 cluster , along with its @xmath46 ( sec .  [ sec : veldispest ] ) , are not inconsistent with the trend between @xmath47 and @xmath4 for globular clusters in dwarf galaxies and in the outer galactic halo suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "the structural parameters of wlm-1 have been previously derived using starcounts by @xcite who found a core radius of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 pc ) and a tidal radius of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 pc ) .",
    "a comparison of the background - subtracted star count profile and background - subtracted surface brightness profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sbprofile ] ) yields a very good match down to @xmath52 , where the star counts start to become incomplete . at @xmath53",
    "the two profiles diverge ; the star counts turn over while the surface brightness profile continues to rise down to @xmath54 , at which point the ccd becomes saturated .",
    "we speculate that this incompleteness in the star counts is the source of hodge s large parameter values .",
    "other quantities which will be of use later in this paper include the half - light radius @xmath47 , the central @xmath55-band surface brightness @xmath56 , and the mean surface brightness inside the half - light radius @xmath57 .",
    "we estimate these parameters from the best - fit king model to the f555w ( @xmath55 ) band hst data .",

    "these background regions are scaled according to the ellipticity for the minor axes extractions .",
    "note that the slit is too narrow for background subtraction on the blue chip ; however , as there are no significant sky lines in the blue , this should not affect the results .",
    "one should note that the wlm-1 cluster is relatively large .",
    "the tidal radius is @xmath89 ( sec .  [ sec : sbprofile ] ) , while the slits used in this paper to obtain the spectra are only @xmath66 and @xmath68 long .",
    "thus the _ entire _ slit has contributions from cluster stars , and any attempt at background subtraction will also subtract cluster light .    we plot the three narrow spectral extractions along the major axis in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "this very small piece of the total spectrum illustrates the variation in signal - to - noise ratio with each extraction and the abundance of absorption features available for measuring velocities .",
    "terrestrial atmospheric absorption lines are noticeable in our red - u spectra .",
    "two bands are especially strong : h@xmath90o at 58806020  , and o@xmath90 at 62006360  .",
    "we did not observe atmospheric standards , and therefore we have no way to accurately correct for this absorption .",
    "however , if not removed these absorption lines will bias our red - u derived rotation velocity toward zero since they are at exactly the same wavelengths on both sides of the cluster .    to remove the telluric absorption lines we simply set any such absorption to the continuum value .",
    "we start with a high - resolution atmospheric transmission atlas , smooth it to our resolution , and create a `` telluric mask '' for our spectra .",
    "this mask has regions of high transmission set to one , and absorption regions , where the transmission is less than 95% , are set to a very large number . before cross - correlating the spectra , but after continuum subtraction , we divide by this telluric mask , and effectively set all significant regions of atmospheric absorption to the continuum level .",
    "we thus lose any velocity information about wlm-1 which may have been contained in these masked regions , but the cross - correlation will no longer be biased by these strong atmospheric features .",
    "a region of telluric absorption is shown in figure  [ fig : telluric ] before and after masking .",
    "the goal of these observations is to unambiguously measure the rotation velocity of wlm-1",
    ". one method of getting an estimate of the magnitude of this rotation would be to follow the original theoretical calculations of @xcite for the ellipticity of a rotating cluster , which is equivalent to assuming that the cluster is a rotating fluid body . assuming a distance modulus of @xmath38 @xcite , which corresponds to 4.28 pc / arcsec , we find that the rotation velocity of wlm-1 should be of the order @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the effective density calculated for non - homogeneous clusters @xcite",
    ". thus if this cluster is indeed elliptical as a result of rotation , we might expect to measure a difference of @xmath93  km s@xmath2  along the major axis , and zero along the minor axis ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : veldisp ] for a more detailed estimate of the expected rotation ) .",
    "while our spectra are not of high signal - to - noise ratio , especially in the very narrow extractions , we do have a reasonably large wavelength coverage .",
    "thus while measuring the position of a single line yields a relatively large error , combining the results for the hundreds of lines present across the spectra increases the precision greatly . one way to simultaneously compare the positions of all features in two spectra is cross - correlation .",
    "we use the fourier cross - correlation technique of @xcite , which has been implemented in the iraf fxcor task .",
    "this routine computes the height , width , and location of the cross - correlation peak of two spectra . for each axis",
    "we correlate the north / south ( major ) and east / west ( minor ) extractions which lie at equal radii .",
    "the results of these correlations for the narrow extractions along both the major and minor axes are shown in figure  [ fig : xcor ] .",
    "the center of the peak is determined by fitting the top 5 points with gaussian functions .",
    "this yields a direct measure of the velocity shift between the two , which is equal to twice the cluster rotation velocity at that distance .",
    "we start with the reduced , extracted spectra from each chip . in preparation for the cross - correlation",
    "we subtract the continuum by fitting with a cubic spline .",
    "the telluric absorption is removed from the red - u spectra following the procedure outlined in section  [ sec : telluric ] .",
    "we then cross - correlate the spectra from each ( blue , red - l , red - u ) chip .",
    "since the reductions , extractions , and wavelength calibrations are completely separate for each chip , this should give three independent , although weaker , measures of the cross - correlation velocity for each extraction .",
    "the results of this piecewise cross - correlation are listed in table  [ tab : piecewisexcor ] for all symmetric extractions , and allow one to compare the quality of the correlation for each chip .",
    "we then combine the spectra from all the chips , and cross - correlate the result , excluding the @xmath94   gaps between the chips .",
    "the results of correlating the combined spectra are listed in table  [ tab : xcor ] , and shown in figure  [ fig : rotation ] .",
    "rather than only make one cross - correlation measurement to obtain the velocity at each radius , we can also cross - correlate all possible permutations , and find the velocities which are most consistent with all correlations . in other words ,",
    "cross - correlating the spectrum extracted from @xmath95 and @xmath96 will give a measure of @xmath97 .",
    "however , one can also correlate spectra from different radii , @xmath95 and @xmath98 , to obtain the relative velocity difference @xmath99 .    using all six narrow extractions yields 15 correlation permutations .",
    "thus we have 15 measurements which depend on only three quantities , assuming that we should find equal but opposite velocities at the same radius on either side of the cluster .",
    "we solve for the most probable velocities by minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviation of each correlation .",
    "thus instead of basing a rotation velocity on only one measurement of the cross - correlation of two spectra at equal distances from the cluster center , we measure 15 correlations between all 6 spectral extractions and find the three velocities which are in best agreement with all measurements .",

    "the velocity dispersion can be derived from the width of the cross - correlation peak , which is the sum of the line widths of the two spectra being correlated added in quadrature . in the case of the globular cluster wlm-1 ,",
    "the line width is a combination of the intrinsic stellar line width , the instrumental profile , and the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "unfortunately , no template star was measured at the time of our observations .    in order to estimate the velocity dispersion of wlm-1 , we used two high - resolution stellar spectra obtained from the uves paranal observatory project @xcite as templates .",
    "we chose hd  30562 and hd  45067 ( both f8v stars ) because of their similarities in line strengths to the wlm-1 spectrum .",
    "it is important to note that the template spectra were obtained using the @xmath24 slit and no binning , while the wlm-1 spectra used @xmath63 binning .",
    "we therefore rebinned the template stars to the same resolution as our observations .    in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the wlm-1 spectra",
    ", we averaged together the spectra extracted from opposite sides of the cluster ( since we only want to compare the velocity dispersions along the major and minor axes ) .",
    "we then analyzed the spectra measured on each chip separately to allow optimal fourier filtering and rejection of undesirable lines .",
    "for example , we rejected the blue end of the blue chip which was contaminated by broad hydrogen lines and caii h&k lines , the region around h@xmath138 on the red - l chip , and h@xmath139 on the red - u chip .",
    "we then cross - correlated each wlm-1 spectrum with each of the two template spectra .",
    "this gives a cross - correlation width for each template , which are then averaged .",
    "the resulting cross - correlation widths derived for the integrated cluster spectra are 28.7 and 29.0  km s@xmath2for the major and minor axes respectively .",
    "this width is the quadratic sum of the wlm-1 and template line widths . in order to estimate the line widths of the templates , we cross -",
    "correlate the two templates with one another , and averaging the values from each chip , we find a width of 16.4  km s@xmath2 .",
    "if we make the ( generous ) assumption that the wlm-1 and template spectra have the same instrumental width and intrinsic stellar line widths , it is now possible to subtract these components to find the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "subtracting in quadrature yields velocity dispersions of 23.5 and 23.9  km s@xmath2  along the major and minor axes respectively .",
    "following the same procedure for each of the various spectral extractions of wlm-1 yields the velocity dispersion profile shown in figure  [ fig : veldisp ] , where the errors are three times the velocity errors , as estimated in section  [ sec : rotationerrors ] . here the extraction semi - major axis distances are shown using flux - weighted centers .",
    "for comparison we have overplotted the velocity dispersion profiles predicted by the isotropic maxwellian distribution of the king model .",
    "these curves show the velocity dispersions computed according to eq .",
    "( 31 ) in @xcite with a concentration @xmath140 2.00 , 2.25 , and 2.50 , scaled to match the observed central velocity dispersion ( but see sec .",
    "[ sec : veldispest ] ) , where the @xmath141 profile is the flattest and , of these three curves , the best fit to the data .",
    "the discrepancy between the model and the measured data points ( given that the light profile indicates @xmath142 ) suggests that either the mass distribution is more extended than predicted by a king profile or that there is a systematic problem in our measurement of the velocity dispersion .    in order to verify that any observed differences ( or lack thereof ) in line widths are inherent in the source spectra and not due to changes in the instrumental / atmospheric contribution ,",
    "we have also compared the widths of unresolved telluric absorption lines in each using the atmospheric transmission spectrum described in section  [ sec : telluric ] as the template .",
    "we first excise a region of each wlm-1 spectrum in the range 62706320  which is dominated by absorption lines due to atmospheric o@xmath90 .",
    "we remove the continuum and broad features by fitting with a high - order cubic spline , and estimate the instrumental width of each via cross - correlation with the atmospheric spectrum .",
    "the widths of the telluric lines present in the major- and minor - axis spectra differ by less than 0.05  km s@xmath2 , confirming the stability of the conditions during the observations .",
    "our _ absolute _ measurement of the velocity dispersion profiles is uncertain due to the low signal - to - noise of our spectra , and the imperfect match with the templates which were obtained at a different time using a different instrument configuration .",
    "however , the _ relative _ velocity dispersion between the major and minor axes should be much more reliable .",
    "the bottom of figure  [ fig : veldisp ] shows the difference between the velocity dispersions measured along the major and minor axes .",
    "all spectral extraction regions are consistent with zero difference , and comparing the integrated cluster spectra measured along the major and minor axes yields a difference of only @xmath143  km s@xmath2  ( major  minor ) .",
    "we can obtain an estimate of the central velocity dispersion of wlm-1 as a reality check of our measurement of the velocity dispersion profile . the simplest way to obtain a rough estimate of the velocity dispersion",
    "is to utilize the correlation between the central velocity dispersion and the cluster absolute magnitude which was found by @xcite to be followed by globular clusters in several different galaxies .",
    "on the basis of figure  3 ( top panel ) in djorgovski et al . , we find    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is in km s@xmath2 .",
    "we use the apparent magnitude of the cluster from table  i in @xcite , @xmath146  mag , and the extinction and distance moduli estimated by @xcite , @xmath147  mag and @xmath38  mag , respectively , to find @xmath148  mag for wlm-1 .",
    "the above relation then gives a central velocity dispersion @xmath149  km s@xmath2 .",
    "a perhaps more accurate estimate for the central velocity dispersion of the cluster can be obtained from the `` fundamental plane '' correlation for globular clusters , as provided by @xcite . in particular",
    ", djorgovski has shown that ( galactic ) globulars follow tight relations between the central velocity dispersion @xmath145 , the central surface brightness @xmath56 , and the core radius @xmath150 , on the one hand ; and between @xmath145 , the half - light radius @xmath47 , and mean surface brightness within @xmath47 , @xmath151 . based on his equations  ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) , we find :    @xmath152    and    @xmath153    where @xmath150 and @xmath47 are in parsecs , and @xmath145 in km s@xmath2 .",
    "using equation  ( [ eqn : sigrc ] ) with the structural parameters derived in section  [ sec : sbprofile ] , core radius @xmath154 pc and central @xmath55-band surface brightness @xmath155  mag / arcsec@xmath35 , we estimate the velocity dispersion to be @xmath156  km s@xmath2 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : sigrh ] ) with the half - light radius @xmath157 pc and the mean surface brightness inside the half - light radius @xmath158 mag / arcsec@xmath35 gives a central velocity dispersion of @xmath159  km s@xmath2 .",
    "these estimates of the central velocity dispersion are lower than our measurements in figure  [ fig : veldisp ] , but the uncertainties do not exclude our value .",
    "the larger velocity dispersion implies that the mass of wlm-1 lies on the high side of the relation derived for galactic clusters .",
    "extracting an integrated spectrum from the entire cluster using a @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) aperture yields a relatively high signal - to - noise spectrum relative to the partial extractions used to measure cluster rotation .",
    "these integrated spectra have many strong lines from which we can measure the net radial velocity of the cluster . in order to make this measurement , we first calculated and corrected for terrestrial motion , based on the observation times of 2003/10/03 at 3:23 and 4:23 ut for the minor and major - axis respectively .",
    "we obtained an atomic line list from @xcite , and used the iraf task rvidlines to calculate the radial velocity .",
    "centroiding @xmath162 lines in each of the major and minor axis spectra yields heliocentric radial velocities of @xmath163 and @xmath164  km s@xmath2  respectively . averaging the results we estimate that the heliocentric radial velocity of wlm-1 is @xmath165 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the radial velocity of the wlm galaxy is @xmath166  km s@xmath2  @xcite , thus the cluster has a velocity of @xmath167  km s@xmath2  with respect to its host .",
    "it appears that the ellipticity of wlm-1 can not be due to rotation , so perhaps wlm-1 is ( in a sense ) more like elliptical galaxies , where anisotropies in the velocity dispersion play an important role in the observed morphology . to address this hypothesis",
    "we employ the tensor virial theorem , as described in @xcite , to obtain information about the relation between the ratio of rotation velocity and velocity dispersion @xmath168 , on the one hand , and ellipticity , on the other .",
    "we start by assuming that a globular cluster is an oblate spheroid , rotating around the @xmath169 axis , and is seen edge - on .",
    "we assume , moreover , that the system s isodensity surfaces are concentric ellipsoids . defining @xmath170 as the mass - weighted mean - square rotation speed , and @xmath171 as the mass - weighted mean - square random velocity along the line of sight , we arrive at the following relation :    @xmath172 - 2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath173 is a parameter that measures the anisotropy of the velocity dispersion tensor and @xmath174 is the _ eccentricity _ , which is related to the ellipticity @xmath175 as follows :    @xmath176    using these equations",
    ", we can build a family of curves giving @xmath177 as a function of ellipticity for different values of @xmath178 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : velanisotropy ] .",
    "binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) argue that the representative points in the @xmath179 plane of systems that are flattened by rotation lie close to the curve @xmath180 , _ independent _ of the inclination angle @xmath181 .",
    "the mean ellipticity of wlm-1 , as measured in section  [ sec : ellipticity ] , is @xmath182 , which is indicated in figure  [ fig : velanisotropy ] by the vertical dashed line .",
    "as the low mass of the wlm galaxy effectively rules out the possibility that wlm-1 owes its ellipticity to tidal effects or gravothermal shocks , this figure very nicely illustrates the kinematical combinations available to explain the ellipticity of wlm-1 .    at one extreme , the ellipticity of wlm-1 could be produced entirely by rotation . in this scenario",
    "there is no velocity anisotropy ( @xmath183 ) , and reading from the plot , we see that @xmath184 .",
    "taking a conservative estimate of 10  km s@xmath2  for the central velocity dispersion of the cluster ( sec .",
    "[ sec : veldisp ] ) , the required rotation would be 5.7  km s@xmath2 .",
    "however , as we find no measurable rotation ( @xmath185  km s@xmath2 ) , we exclude this possibility .    at the other extreme ,",
    "the ellipticity of wlm-1 is due entirely to velocity anisotropy .",
    "the quantity @xmath186 , defined as the ratio between the diagonal terms of the velocity dispersion tensor along the rotation ( `` @xmath169 '' ) axis and along the elongation ( `` @xmath187 '' ) axis , should scale as    @xmath188    from figure  [ fig : velanisotropy ] , one sees that if there is zero rotation ( @xmath189 ) , it is possible to produce the observed ellipticity with a velocity dispersion parameter of @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , wlm-1 s flattening could be accounted for if the velocity dispersion along the rotation axis were smaller than along the elongation axis by @xmath191 again taking the nominal velocity dispersion to be @xmath192  km s@xmath2 , this velocity anisotropy would only produce a difference of 0.7  km s@xmath2  in velocity dispersion between the major and minor axes .",
    "such a difference would be too small to be detected on the basis of our data .",
    "therefore , while we can not prove that velocity anisotropy is responsible for the observed shape of wlm-1 , it certainly appears to be the only option that is consistent with our observations .",
    "we have analyzed vlt uves long - slit spectra and hst wfpc2 images of the extragalactic globular cluster wlm-1 in an attempt to understand the cause of its elliptical morphology .",
    "unlike the situation for galactic globular clusters whose detailed shapes may be influenced by their massive host galaxy , wlm is a low - mass dwarf irregular galaxy , eliminating the possibilities that the non - sphericity of wlm-1 could be caused by either tidal stresses or gravothermal shocks .",
    "this leaves two explanations for the flattening of this cluster : internal rotation and/or velocity dispersion anisotropy .",
    "cluster rotation seemed to be a prime candidate for the origin of wlm-1 s ellipticity since two - body relaxation , which erases any primordial anisotropy , is relatively efficient in star clusters .",
    "in addition , rotation has been measured for several galactic globular clusters using both proper motion and radial velocity techniques [ the review by @xcite lists the rotation velocities of 11 clusters ] .",
    "the most notable case is that of @xmath3  cen , which exhibits correlated rotation and flattening profiles , strongly suggesting that its ellipticity is due to rotation .",
    "we therefore obtained high - resolution long - slit echelle spectra along the major and minor axes of the cluster .",
    "we used cross - correlation to look for velocity shifts on opposite sides of the cluster , dividing the cluster into annuli in an attempt to obtain a rotation velocity profile .",
    "however , we found no evidence for rotation ( @xmath193  km s@xmath2 ) along either the major or minor axes of the cluster .",
    "as the cluster would require a rotation of @xmath194  km s@xmath2  to sustain its shape , we conclude that rotation is definitely not the main driver of wlm-1 s ellipticity .",
    "the only remaining plausible source of flattening in the wlm cluster is velocity dispersion anisotropy , the main reason elliptical galaxies are elliptical .",
    "we attempted to measure the stellar velocity dispersion in wlm-1 based on the width of the cross - correlation peak ; however , due to our large errors , we could see no statistically significant difference between the velocity dispersions measured along the major and minor axes .",
    "calculations reveal that the magnitude of the velocity anisotropy required to produce the observed ellipticity is relatively small : a 7% difference in velocity dispersion , or less than 1  km s@xmath2 , which is smaller than our velocity dispersion measurement errors .",
