    "quantum chaos refers to specific properties of the spectrum and the eigenstates of a system , most notably to correlations between the eigenvalues that result in avoided crossings  @xcite . in the context of nuclear physics ,",
    "the analysis of the statistical properties of the spectrum dates back to wigner s works  @xcite and was soon extended to other complex systems , such atoms , molecules and condensed matter models . from a dynamical perspective",
    ", the onset of quantum chaos has been associated with very fast relaxation processes .",
    "nevertheless , fast equilibration is found also in non - chaotic systems .",
    "this paper is devoted to the description of dynamical quantities that can unambiguously identify the presence of level repulsion in lattice many - body quantum systems .    in an attempt to distinguish quantum motion in chaotic and regular systems",
    ", peres  @xcite argued that after the saturation of the loschmidt echo , the fluctuations in chaotic models should be smaller than in regular systems .",
    "more recently , however , it has been shown that the amplitudes of the fluctuations after equilibration decrease with system size in a very similar way for chaotic and also integrable systems with interactions  @xcite .",
    "comparisons between infinite - time averages and thermodynamic averages have also been used to determine the onset of thermalization and by extension of quantum chaos  @xcite , although the results depend on the initial state  @xcite and at high energies level repulsion may in fact not be essential .",
    "in contrast to these approaches , we focus here on evident manifestations of avoided crossings that can emerge before the equilibration of the system .",
    "quantum chaos has been linked with the linear growth in time of the von neumann entanglement entropy up to saturation  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is analogous to what happens to the shannon information entropy  @xcite , which has the advantage of being computationally less expensive .",
    "however , the linear growth of entropies is observed also in interacting integrable models  @xcite .",
    "similarly , quantum chaos has been connected with the initial exponential decay of the survival probability and loschmidt echo  @xcite , but the same is verified in integrable models  @xcite and decays even faster are found in both regimes  @xcite .    in interacting systems with onsite disorder ,",
    "localization due to large disorder occurs in parallel with the disappearance of level repulsion .",
    "dynamical features at the vicinity of the delocalized - localized transition , which encompass the logarithmic growth of both entanglement and shannon entropies  @xcite and the power - law decay of the survival probability with exponents smaller than 1 @xcite , may then be taken as signatures of the chaos - integrable transition .",
    "but this is a very particular example , where both transitions coincide .",
    "we seek for means to differentiate chaos from integrability in general scenarios , including also clean models and the spatially delocalized phases of disordered systems .",
    "the power - law decay of the survival probability at long times is not exclusive to systems in the vicinity of the transition to the localized phase .",
    "this behavior is inevitable in any quantum system , but its origins as well as the values of the power - law exponents vary  @xcite .",
    "one ever - present cause of power - law decays is the unavoidable bounds in the energy spectrum of quantum systems  @xcite . in lattice many - body quantum systems with two - body interactions , this leads to exponents close to 2 @xcite .",
    "such large exponents indicate chaotic initial states and anticipate thermalization  @xcite , but they are still not explicit signatures of level repulsion .",
    "unambiguous dynamical manifestations of level repulsion happen at yet longer times , of the order of ( but smaller than ) the inverse of the mean level spacing .",
    "it shows up in the form of a drop in the value of the survival probability below its saturation point , a phenomenon known as correlation hole  @xcite .",
    "as we discuss here , it also leads to a minor bulge above the saturation values of the shannon and entanglement entropies .",
    "the correlation hole reflects the long - range correlations of the eigenvalues of complex systems .",
    "it is the dip of the spectral form factor discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it has also been investigated in molecules  @xcite , random matrices  @xcite and microwave billiards  @xcite . here ,",
    "we extend these studies to clean and disordered spin-1/2 models .",
    "we stress that in this work we equate the term quantum chaos with level repulsion , more precisely with the wigner - dyson distribution of the spacings between neighboring levels  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to view quantum chaos as the emergence of chaotic eigenstates .",
    "the latter refers to states with a very large number of uncorrelated components , which may occur even in systems that do not show level repulsion  @xcite .",
    "this leads to generic dynamical behaviors that exhibit very fast relaxation processes .",

[ figentropy ] seem unable to differentiate integrable from chaotic models",

    "[ figfid ] , these drops are more significant for the clean xxz and nnn models than for the defect model .",
    "due to the energy bounds in the spectrum , the initial gaussian decay gives place to a power - law decay at later times .",
    "for small system sizes , this behavior is noticeable in disordered models  @xcite , where averages over several disorder realizations and initial states are performed .",
    "the power - law decay is not visible in fig .",
    "[ figfid ] , probably because of large finite size effects , but the small values of @xmath95 for @xmath96 may be an indication that it was at the verge of appearance . in the vicinity of the point",
    "where the decay of the survival probability changes from gaussian to power - law , there occurs an interference between the two contributions .",
    "this causes a phenomenon known as survival collapse  @xcite that often results in @xmath95 , as indeed confirmed for spin-1/2 systems in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is for times even longer , @xmath97 , that the correlation hole finally develops , first for the nnn model , where the minimum occurs at @xmath98 for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ figfid ] , and later for the defect model , where the minimum is at @xmath99 .",
    "the energy range of the spectrum of the nnn model is broader than for the defect model , while both have the same number of levels for the same system size .",
    "since the time for the emergence of the correlation hole is related to the inverse of the mean level spacing , this explains why the hole emerges earlier for the nnn model . by comparing fig .",
    "[ figfid ] ( e ) and the inset of fig .",
    "[ figentropy ] ( e ) , we also notice that the maximum value in the bulge of the shannon entropy occurs at a time of the same order of magnitude as the time for the minimum of the correlation hole . after the correlation hole",
    ", the survival probability simply fluctuates around the saturation point , @xmath87 .",
    "the fluctuations tend to be smaller in chaotic models [ compare fig .",
    "[ figfid ] ( d ) and fig",
    ".  [ figfid ] ( e ) ] , but they decrease with system size in a similar way for chaotic and interacting integrable models  @xcite .",
    "in the interacting disordered spin-1/2 model with @xmath100 and @xmath33 , a transition region between the chaotic delocalized phase and the localized phase in space emerges when the disorder strength gets larger than the coupling strength , @xmath101 . in this region , the level statistics is intermediate and the eigenstates are multifractal  @xcite",
    ". we deal with extended nonergodic eigenstates that become more correlated as @xmath40 increases .",
    "these correlations are responsible for the logarithmic growth of the entanglement  @xcite and shannon entropies  @xcite , and for the power - law decays of local observables  @xcite , the out - of - time correlators  @xcite , and the survival probability with exponents smaller than 1 @xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the fractal dimension obtained from scaling analysis of the participation ratio of the initial state projected into the energy eigenbasis .",
    "@xmath104 also agrees with the fractal dimension obtained from scaling analysis of the participation ratio of the eigenstates written in the site - basis vectors .",
    "since the delocalized - localized transition in disordered models with interactions happens in parallel with the transition from a wigner - dyson to a poisson distribution  @xcite , we can use the disappearance of level repulsion to capture the transition to the many - body localized phase .",
    "one way to do this is by computing the eigenvalues to directly study level statistics .",
    "the other is by analyzing the evolution of the survival probability and how the correlation hole fades away as the disorder strength becomes large .",
    "the latter is the approach taken here .",
    "figure  [ figloc ] shows the survival probability for different values of @xmath40 .",

    "( [ intp0ge ] ) , @xmath105 , leads to the power - law decay with exponent @xmath106 .",
    "this exponent reflects the level of correlations of the eigenstates  @xcite , as mentioned above . in the chaotic regime ,",
    "the power - law exponent is larger than 1 and can no longer be explained in terms of the correlations between eigenstates .",
