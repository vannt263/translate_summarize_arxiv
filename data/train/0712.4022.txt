    "one of the main tools of probing the complex character of the many - body correlations and interactions in semiconductors is the multi - wave mixing response .",
    "the multi - wave mixing polarization in optically excited semiconductors produces the signal in directions that are prohibited in the linear regime because of momentum conservation , thus giving access to the semiconductor many - body excitations .",
    "the typical example is the four - wave mixing spectroscopy.@xcite recently also wave mixing of higher orders started to draw attention.@xcite a great success in understanding the mechanism of the formation of the nonlinear response in general was achieved in relatively low - field limit using the perturbation theory with respect to the external field.@xcite perturbational description , however , is not suitable for investigating the coherent reconstruction of the spectrum , such as in the case of rabi oscillations . for a qualitative analysis of such phenomena",
    "few - level quantum models have been used.@xcite this approach , however , misses the important property of the excitations in semiconductors .",
    "these excitations constitute a quantum field rather than a canonical quantum mechanical system .",
    "the system supports infinitely many states unless , of course , the spectrum has truly discrete component , that is when the excitations are localized , such as in quantum dots .",
    "thus a description non - perturbative with respect to the external field must deal with many - body aspects of the dynamics of the system.@xcite in order to treat this problem a variety of methods based on derivation of respective closed equations of motion was developed.@xcite unfortunately , the dynamical equations turn out to be very complex owing to the coulomb interaction , which is shown to be crucially important at relatively long time scales.@xcite therefore , one has to resort to numerical calculations investigating the dynamics of the exciton polarization . the numerical simulations proved to describe successfully the dynamics @xcite but they are difficult to apply for studying the detailed effect of different contributions to the dynamics and its dependence on parameters of the system . as a result , the theory of the semiconductor response suffers from a lack of exact results obtained in controllable approximations which would guide the respective numerical , theoretical , and experimental studies .    at short time",
    "scales , however , one can rely on significant simplification of the dynamics of the system due to negligible phase change during the optical excitation .",
    "effectively , the system follows the external field , which is illustrated best by a simple dynamical model @xmath0 p(t ) + e(t)\\ ] ] with @xmath1 being a real positive function .",
    "if initially the system is at rest , @xmath2 , we can present the time dependence @xmath3 in the form @xmath4\\right ]    e(t').\\ ] ] this representation is convenient for comparing the responses of the system with respect to the @xmath5-functional excitation @xmath6 and to the excitation with the piece - wise constant amplitude @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the duration of the forced regime . as follows from eq .",

    "yields an estimate maximally different from the @xmath5-pulse case in the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "thus if the excitation pulse is shorter than the time scale determined by @xmath12 , i.e. if @xmath13 , then the response with respect to the constant pulse of finite duration differs up to quadratic terms from the @xmath5-pulse response only by the phase factor @xmath14 .",
    "an immediate application of this consideration to the evolution of the exciton polarization in optically excited semiconductors is prevented by the more complex character of the polarization dynamics , namely , by the field induced coupling between the polarization and the charge densities . in order to see the principal differences introduced by this coupling we consider a model @xmath15 straightforward substitution of the @xmath5-shaped pulse into this equation obviously fails since now the amplitudes in front of the @xmath5-function in the coupling terms are given by the quantities , @xmath16 and @xmath3 , which experience discontinuity at exactly the point of singularity of the @xmath5-function .",
    "therefore , we need to consider the case of the external pulse of finite duration . for the pulse with piece - wise constant amplitude @xmath17 , as in the previous example , eq .   with the initial conditions @xmath2 , @xmath18 is solved for @xmath19 by @xmath20 , \\\\",

    "applying now the similar idea for estimating a phase shift as for the analysis of eq .",
    "we can see that the conclusion about small perturbations vanishing with @xmath32 holds also in the case of @xmath27-dependent frequency and renormalized coupling @xmath33 we consider the limiting case when the effect of the internal dynamics can be completely neglected , which corresponds to the cases @xmath34 in the examples considered above .",

    "<S> we studied the semiconductor response with respect to high intensity resonant excitation on short time scale when the contribution of the fermi statistics of the electrons and holes prevails . </S>",
    "<S> we studied both the single and double pulse excitations . for the latter case we considered the time evolution of the multi - wave mixing exciton polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between the excitation by a single pulse or by two non - collinear pulses is that the rabi oscillations of the multi - wave mixing response are characterized by two harmonics . analyzing the operator dynamics governed by the external excitation we found that there are three invariant spin classes , which do not mix with the evolution of the system . </S>",
    "<S> two classes correspond to the bright exciton states and one contains all dark states . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the dynamics of the classes is described by six frequencies and the rabi frequencies are only two of them ( one for each bright class ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the effect of the dispersion of the electrons and holes and the coulomb interaction describing the semiconductor by the semiconductor bloch equation ( sbe ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if initially the system is in the ground state then the sbe preserves the invariant spin classes thus proving absence of the dark excitons in the framework of this description . </S>",
    "<S> we found that due to the mass difference between holes of different kind additional rabi frequencies , two of those present in the operator dynamics , should appear in the evolution of the exciton polarization . </S>"
