    "the optical spectra of magnetic da white dwarfs are dominated by broad balmer absorption patterns which are characteristic for the magnetic field structure in the visible part of the photosphere . our evolution - strategy based zeeman tomography code allows the determination of the surface magnetic field geometry from a set of rotation - phase resolved flux and circular polarization spectra by fitting theoretical model spectra from a precomputed database on a grid of temperature @xmath1 , field strength @xmath2 , and the angle @xmath3 between the field direction and the line of sight .",
    "the method s ability to reconstruct field geometries from synthetic data has been demonstrated by euchner  et  al .",
    "for the present study , the magnetic field geometry has been parametrized using a truncated multipole expansion up to order @xmath4 .",
    "our vlt / fors1 observations were carried out in may ( pg1015 + 014 ) , jun and dec 1999 ( he1045@xmath00908 ) in spectropolarimetric ( pmos ) mode . in order to eliminate stokes",
    "parameter crosstalk , circular polarization ( @xmath5/@xmath6 ) spectra were computed from two subsequent flux spectra taken with the retarder plate rotated by @xmath745@xmath8 .",
    "we compensated for wavelength - dependent seeing - induced flux losses by normalizing the flux spectra to a mean continuum level ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we collected the spectra into 5 phase bins covering the whole rotation cycle according to the ephemeris of schmidt & norsworthy ( 1991 ) .",
    "the spectra are characterized by sharp , distinct zeeman features without pronounced h@xmath9 triplet structure , thus indicating that the dominating field strengths exceed @xmath1050 mg . the best - fit magnetic field structure ( fig .",
    "2 ) differs clearly from a simple centred or offset dipole . the frequency distribution of field strengths peaks at 70 mg with an additional peak at 80 mg for @xmath11 and 0.86 .",
    "since there are still substantial deviations between observed and best - fit spectra , we conclude that the real field structure is too complex to be modelled adequately by a truncated multipole expansion up to @xmath4 .",
    "this conclusion seems to be justified because for other objects studied by us ( e.g. he 1045@xmath00908 , see below ) the @xmath4 multipole expansion yields satisfactory results .",
    "by comparing our observations to those of schmidt  et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) it seems plausible that our sequence corresponds to @xmath120.5 of the rotation cycle .",
    "thus , we tentatively collect our data into 3 phase bins ( 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 spectrum shows a typical low - field h@xmath9 triplet structure generated by a rather uniform field distribution of @xmath1216 mg that is shallowed out in the subsequent phases by increasing high - field contributions ( fig .",
    "although the model fits the overall shape of the observed spectra fairly well , some small deviations are still obvious .",
    "an insufficient @xmath2 resolution of our database in the low field regime and our simplified linear limb - darkening law are two possible causes ."
