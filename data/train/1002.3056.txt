    "supernovae ( sne ) figure prominently in many fields , whether in their roles as calibratable candles for cosmology , as the major sources of intermediate - mass and heavy elements , as heaters of the interstellar medium , as accelerators of cosmic rays , and more .",
    "physically , they are separated mainly into core - collapse sne ( cc  sne ) , which occur when the iron core of a massive star collapses to form a neutron star or a black hole , and type - ia sne ( sne  ia ) , which explode when a degenerate carbon - oxygen stellar core , probably a white dwarf ( wd ) , approaches ( or , rarely , exceeds ) the chandrasekhar mass , igniting the carbon and triggering a thermonuclear runaway .",
    "the two paths most often hypothesised for this mass growth in sne  ia are the single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario , whereby a wd in a semidetached binary accretes matter from a main - sequence or evolved normal companion star ( whelan & iben 1973 ) , and the double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario , in which two wds merge ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) .",
    "additional , less conventional , paths have also been considered ( e.g. , tout 2005 ; maoz & mannucci 2008 ; raskin et al .",
    "2009a ; rosswog et al .",
    "2009 ) .    for cc  sne",
    ", while many questions remain regarding the progenitors and the physics of particular subtypes , massive progenitor stars have by now been identified in pre - explosion images in a growing number of cases ( see smartt 2009 , for a recent summary ) .",
    "this contrasts with the situation for sne  ia , where only one or two very ambiguous progenitor identifications exist ( voss & nelemans 2008 ; roelofs et al . 2008 ; gonzlez hernndez et al .",
    "2009 ; kerzendorf et al .",
    "we thus do not quite know what is exploding in a sn  ia , an unsatisfactory situation given the ubiquity and importance of these events",
    ".    driven by these problems , a major objective of sn studies has been the recovery of the sn delay - time distribution ( dtd ) .",
    "the dtd is the sn rate as a function of time that would be observed following a @xmath10-function burst of star formation .",
    "( in other contexts , the dtd would be called the delay function , the transfer function , or the green s function . )",
    "knowledge of the dtd would be useful for understanding the route along which cosmic metal enrichment and energy input by sne proceed , but no less important , for obtaining clues about the sn progenitor systems .",
    "different progenitor stars , binary systems , and binary - evolution scenarios predict different dtds .",
    "the lifetime of a star with the minimum initial mass that is thought to lead to a cc  sn explosion , @xmath11 m@xmath6 , sets a time division between cc  sne and sne  ia in the dtd , at @xmath12  myr .",
    "the precise mass border between core collapse and wd formation also depends on metallicity .",
    "furthermore , initially lower - mass stars in tight binaries can become `` rejuvenated '' by mass transfer and explode as cc  sne somewhat later than this .    for sne  ia ,",
    "the situation is much less clear . in both of the currently popular progenitor scenarios , sd and dd , calculations of the dtd",
    "depend on a series of assumptions regarding initial conditions ( initial mass function , binarity fraction , mass - ratio distribution , separation distribution ) , and complex physics ( mass loss , mass transfer , common - envelope evolution , accretion ) that is sometimes computationally intractable except in the most rudimentary , parametrized forms ( e.g. , yungelson & livio 2000 ; hurley et al .",

    "previous attempts to recover the dtd have used sn rates measured in surveys of galaxies at different redshifts ( i.e. , different cosmic times ) , compared to cosmic star - formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "this has been attempted for field surveys ( gal - yam & maoz 2004 ; strolger et al .",

    "an alternative approach has been to look at the sn rates per unit stellar mass in galaxies of particular types ( star forming , quiescent , etc . ) , and to attempt to assign to each type a `` formation age , '' or some generic , simple , sfh ( e.g. , mannucci et al .",

    "results have been controversial and often contradictory .",
    "for example , dahlen et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2008 ) have argued for a sn  ia dtd that is peaked at a delay of @xmath13  gyr , with few sne  ia at delays that are much shorter or longer .",

    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , scannapieco & bildsten ( 2005 ) , and sullivan et al . (",
    "2006 ) have found evidence for the existence of comparable numbers of both `` prompt '' and `` delayed '' sne  ia : the former explode within @xmath14  myr ( or perhaps even within 100  myr ) of star formation  myr ( mannucci et al .",
    "2006 ) ; @xmath15  myr ( aubourg et al .",
    "2008 ) ; 200500  myr ( raskin et al .",
    "2009b ) ; @xmath16 , @xmath17  myr , or @xmath18  gyr ( scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ) .",
    "the term therefore generally labels delays of roughly a few hundred myr . in our analysis of the lick observatory sn search herein",
    ", we will define prompt sne  ia as those with delays @xmath1  myr .",
    "] , while the latter may have delays as long as 10  gyr .",
    "the sn  ia rate has been described as the sum of two components , one proportional to stellar mass and the other proportional to the cc  sn rate ( mannucci et al . 2005 ) . in the similar",
    "`` @xmath19 '' parameterisation introduced by scannapieco & bildsten ( 2005 ) , the prompt - component rate is proportional to the star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the two sn  ia components need not represent two distinct physical populations . instead",
    ", they could constitute the sne included in two coarsely sampled time bins of what is in reality a continuous dtd .",
    "for example , pritchet et al . (",
    "2008 ) have argued that a @xmath20 power - law dtd provides an improved fit , compared to the @xmath19 model , to the dependence of sn rates on galaxy sfr , as measured in the supernova legacy survey .",
    "we also note that a truly bimodal dtd , if it exists , could arise either from two different coexisting progenitor paths ( e.g. , dd and sd ) , or from bimodality in some secondary parameter , such as the binary separation distribution , of a single explosion mechanism .",
    "regardless , there is currently an unclear picture on the form of the dtd , even at the most coarse resolution level .    a shortcoming of the approaches described above for recovering the dtd is that they involve averaging over the galaxy population ( i.e.",
    ", all the sne are assumed to come from the entire host population considered ) , or averaging over time ( i.e. , the detailed sfh of a galaxy is represented by a single `` age '' or simplified history for all galaxies of a certain type ) .",
    "consequently , these approaches involve loss of information , and potential systematic errors ( e.g. , due to unrepresentative simplified histories ) .    in this paper , the fourth in a series analysing sn rates from the lick observatory sn search ( loss ) ,",
    "we introduce a new approach to recover the dtd , by posing dtd inversion as a discretised linear problem . in this process",
    ", we use all of the available information on the sfhs of individual galaxies , rather than averaging rates over many types of galaxies in some redshift interval , or assigning a mean star - formation - weighted age to each galaxy . in  2 below",
    ", we present the method , and in  3 , we apply the method to a subsample of loss galaxies and their sne .",
    "we test the method s performance on simulated sn surveys in  4 .",
    "our results are summarised and we discuss some future prospects in  5 .",
    "consider a sample of @xmath21 galaxies .",
    "the sn rate in the @xmath22th galaxy observed at cosmic time @xmath23 is given by the convolution @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the sfr versus cosmic time of the @xmath22th galaxy ( stellar mass formed per unit time ) , @xmath26 is the dtd ( sne per unit time per unit stellar mass formed ) , and the integration is from the big bang ( @xmath27 ) to the time of observation . for the purpose of this paper , we assume that the dtd is a universal function : it is the same in all galaxies , independent of environment , metallicity , and cosmic time  a simplifying assumption that may be invalid at some level .",
    "for example , a dependence of sn delay time on metallicity is expected in some models ( e.g. , kobayashi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , variations in the initial mass function ( imf ) with cosmic times or environment would also lead to a variable dtd , but we will again ignore this possibility in the present context .",
    "in contrast to the averaging approaches followed in the past ( see  1 ) , we will attempt to recover the dtd by directly inverting a linear , discretized version of eq .",
    "[ convolution ] , where the detailed history of every individual galaxy or galaxy subunit is taken into account .",
    "suppose the sfhs of the @xmath28 galaxies monitored as part of a sn survey are known ( e.g. , based on reconstruction of their stellar populations ) , with a temporal resolution that permits binning the stellar mass formed in each galaxy into @xmath29 discrete time bins , where increasing @xmath30 corresponds to increasing lookback time .",
    "the time bins need not necessarily be equal , and generally will not be , since the temporal resolution of the sfh reconstruction degrades with increasing lookback time . for the @xmath22th galaxy in the survey ,",
    "the stellar mass formed in the @xmath30th time bin is @xmath31 .",
    "the mean of the dtd over the @xmath30th bin ( corresponding to a delay range equal to the lookback - time range of the @xmath30th bin in the sfh ) is @xmath32 .",
    "then the integration in eq .",
    "[ convolution ] can be approximated as a sum , @xmath33 where @xmath34 , the sn rate in a given galaxy , is measured at a particular cosmic time ( e.g. , corresponding to the redshift of the particular sn survey ) .",
    "given a survey of @xmath21 galaxies , each with an observed sn rate , @xmath34 , and a known binned sfh , @xmath31 , one could , in principle , algebraically invert this set of linear equations and recover the best - fit parameters describing the binned dtd : @xmath35 .",
    "in practice , on human timescales sne in a given galaxy are rare events ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "supernova surveys therefore monitor many galaxies , and record the number of sne discovered in every galaxy . for a given model dtd , @xmath37",
    ", the @xmath22th galaxy will have an expected number of sne @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the effective visibility time ( often called the `` control time '' ) during which a sn of a particular type would have been visible ( given the actual on - target monitoring time , the distance to the galaxy , the flux limits of the survey , and the detection efficiency ) . since @xmath40 ,",
    "the number of sne observed in the @xmath22th galaxy , @xmath41 , obeys a poisson probability distribution with expectation value @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath41 is 0 for most of the galaxies , 1 for some of the galaxies , and more than 1 for very few galaxies .",
    "we now introduce a nonparametric , maximum - likelihood method to recover the dtd and its uncertainties . considering a set of model dtds , the likelihood of a particular dtd , given the set of measurements @xmath44 , is @xmath45 more conveniently , the log of the likelihood is @xmath46 where obviously only galaxies hosting sne contribute to the second term .",
    "the best - fitting model can be found by scanning the parameter space of the vector @xmath37 for the value that maximizes the log - likelihood .",
    "this procedure naturally allows restricting the dtd to have only positive values , as physically required ( a negative sn rate is meaningless ) .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath47 of the uncertainties in the best - fit parameters can be found ( e.g. , press et al .",
    "1992 ) by calculating the curvature matrix , @xmath48}{\\partial\\psi_j } \\frac{\\partial[\\ln p(n_i|\\lambda_i)]}{\\partial\\psi_k}\\ ] ] @xmath49 and inverting it , @xmath50=[\\alpha]^{-1 } .\\ ] ] because the values of the dtd are constrained to be positive , if the maximum - likelihood value of a dtd component , @xmath32 , is close to zero , the square root of its variance , @xmath51 , will not represent well its @xmath52 uncertainty range .",
    "an alternative , more reliable , procedure is to perform a monte - carlo simulation in which many mock surveys are produced , each having the same galaxies , sfhs , and visibility times as the real survey , and having expectation values @xmath42 based on the best - fit dtd , but with the number of sne in every galaxy , @xmath41 , drawn from a poisson distribution according to @xmath42 .",
    "the maximum - likelihood dtd , @xmath53 , is found for every realization . from the distribution of the values of every component , @xmath32 , over all the realizations",
    ", one can estimate the range encompassing , say , @xmath54 of the cases .",
    "the above approach for recovering the dtd has several advantages over previous methods .",
    "first , all of the known information in the survey is included in the analysis in a statistically rigourous way , including the fact that many ( usually most ) of the galaxies did not host any sne .",
    "furthermore , the calculation is easily generalized to cases where the galaxies are not all at the same distances ( e.g. , combinations of surveys done at different redshifts )  one simply needs to use the appropriate sfh bins and visibility times for every galaxy .",
    "in fact , assuming that the dtd is a universal function , it is straightforward to include in a single analysis the data from completely disparate sn surveys .",
    "for example , one could combine the results of normal sn surveys with unconventional sn `` surveys , '' in which the sn rate is measured based on sn remnants in small subunits of a few nearby galaxies ( maoz & badenes 2010 ) .",
    "the number and resolution of the time bins used in the analysis will naturally depend on the quality of the data .",
    "larger numbers of observed sne , @xmath55 , as well as better data on the parent stellar populations ( integrated colors and/or spectra ) , will permit a larger number of independent sfh and dtd time bins , and will thus improve the time resolution of the recovered dtd .",
    "we quantify this in  4 , below .",
    "we now apply our method to the sn survey data obtained by considering all loss galaxies with sfhs based on spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "first , we summarize briefly the essentials of each of these surveys and of the sample resulting from their intersection .",

    "( 2009 ) performed spectral synthesis modeling of all galaxy spectra in the sdss using their vespa code ( tojeiro et al .",

    "( 2003 ) have shown that the kroupa imf gives a similar total stellar mass to that of a `` diet salpeter '' imf , obtained by multiplying by 0.7 the total mass of the original salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , to account for the reduced number of low - mass stars .",
    "thus , our results will be comparable to other sn rate studies , such as mannucci et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , that have assumed the diet - salpeter imf .      with the kind assistance of r. tojeiro , we have derived vespa sfhs for all of the loss galaxies that have sdss spectroscopy .",
    "our main sample of loss galaxies with vespa sfhs consists of 3505 galaxies that hosted 201 sne , among them 82 sne  ia , 93 sne  ii , and 26 sne  ibc ( see filippenko 1997 for a review of sn types ; here we classify sne  ib and ic as `` ibc '' ) .",
    "an alternative sample , using a different vespa dust model ( see below ) , has slightly different numbers : 3508 galaxies hosting 202 sne , among them 81 sne  ia , 94 sne  ii , and 27 sne  ibc .",
    "these numbers of sne are consistent with those expected based on the fraction of the total loss visibility time that is in the vespa galaxies .",
    "other than the increase in poisson errors due to the smaller number of sne , the limitation of the calculation to vespa galaxies should have no effect on our dtd reconstruction .    for the majority of these galaxies",

    "these correspond to the bins labeled 24 , 25 , 26 , and 27 in tojeiro et al .",
    "however , for each galaxy , the distribution of mass between the first two bins depends strongly on the particular dust model that is assumed , as well as on the spectral synthesis code that is used  bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , or maraston ( 2005 ) ( r. tojeiro , 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "in fact , for some models , only a small fraction of the galaxies have any mass formed in the second time bin , a problem that persists at some level in other models as well . due to this degeneracy",
    ", we have chosen to combine the first two time bins into a single bin , of @xmath69  myr . as the choice of stellar population model parameters affects the results in other time bins as well ,",

    "as we will demonstrate and quantify in  [ crosstalk ] below , this result is due to the following systematic error .",
    "the sdss spectra of many of the loss galaxies ( which are relatively nearby , and hence large in angle ) are dominated by the old populations in the centre of each galaxy , due to the limited @xmath62 aperture size of the sdss fibres .",
    "however , many of the cc  sne explode in the outer regions , where there is ongoing star formation that is invisible to the sdss spectroscopy . as a result , our dtd solution mistakenly associates these cc  sne with an old population , and hence a large delay .",
    "we also note that the integrals over these two bins of the best - fit dtd are comparable : @xmath84 and @xmath85 cc  sne per m@xmath6 formed , respectively , where @xmath86  myr and @xmath87  gyr are the lengths of the time bins .",
    "thus , about 40% of the prompt - bin signal has leaked into bin 2 .",
    "it is unavoidable that the same process will distort the results for the dtd of sne  ia in the same way .    in the third bin , @xmath4  gyr ,",
    "the best - fit amplitude is again nonzero , but only at the @xmath52 level , and the integral over this bin , @xmath88 , is just a few percent of the first two bins .",
    "thus , there is little leakage of power to bin 3 .      to understand the effect of the small - aperture sdss fibres , and in an attempt to find a method of obtaining cleaner signals in the dtd , we have experimented with culling the galaxy sample in various ways , based on the galaxy properties . for example",
    ", we expect that much of the `` leak '' that we see is caused by early - type spirals , in which the spectrum of the bulge , covered by the sdss fibre , is highly unrepresentative of the galaxy disk .",
    "in contrast , elliptical galaxies and late - type spirals both have more spatially uniform stellar populations .",
    "we have therefore derived the dtd , shown in figure  [ bestfitccculled ] , for cc  sne from a subsample that excludes all loss galaxies with hubble types 3 to 5 in the notation of leaman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , corresponding approximately to types sa to sbc .",
    "this reduces the sample size to 1900 galaxies , hosting 34 sne ii and 16 sne ibc ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "as expected , the prompt signal in @xmath89 is strengthened by a factor 2 , while @xmath90 is reduced in amplitude .",
    "the best - fit value for @xmath91 is reduced to 0 . unfortunately , as seen in figure  [ bestfitccculled ] and in the numbers in table  [ table1 ] , hand - in - hand with the increase / decrease in dtd amplitude of the first / second bin , the smaller sn numbers in the reduced sample lead to larger statistical errors .",
    "we have experimented with additional sample culling methods .",
    "for example , the sdss database gives , for each galaxy , the magnitude in each photometric band in an aperture of the size of the spectrograph fibre , and various measures of the total magnitude of the galaxy .",

    "[ crosstalk ] above , at least part of this discrepancy must be due to the limited @xmath62 aperture size of the sdss fibres . just as our cc  sn dtd solution mistakenly associated cc  sne with an old population , and hence a large delay , it will do so for prompt sne  ia that are associated with star - forming regions in the outer parts of a galaxy , outside the bulge - light - dominated fibre aperture . in fact , the leak should be comparable to the 40% effect we saw for cc  sne .",

    "( 2008 ) have all found evidence for sn  ia rates enhanced by factors of a few in cluster galaxies , compared to field early - type galaxies .      from the ratio of the time - integrated dtds , @xmath157 and @xmath190 ( using the value of @xmath157 at @xmath191  mpc for which the cc  sn counts are fairly complete , but for which the errors are not excessively large because of the limited sample size , and @xmath159 from the low - mass sample , see above ) , the time - integrated ratio of cc  sne to sne  ia is @xmath192 .",
    "if we force the value of @xmath193 expected from a diet - salpeter imf with a low - mass cc limit of 8  m@xmath6 , the allowed range in the ratio shrinks to @xmath194 ) .",
    "we note that the ratio of time - integrated dtds is distinct from the observed ratio of _ current rates _ , which is measured to be about 3:1 in local surveys ( mannucci et al .",
    "2005 ; li et al .",
    "the ratio of current rates depends on the summed sfh of the galaxies in the volume",
    ". it can be arbitrarily high for very young , star - forming populations ( in which few sne ia have had time to form yet ) to zero for old , inactive populations ( with no cc  sne ) .",
    "in contrast , the ratio of the time - integrated dtds , like the dtds themselves , is independent of sfh , and intrinsic to the stellar - evolution processes that lead to sne .",
    "the ratio @xmath195 of course equals @xmath196 , for the diet salpeter imf and the said lower limit for cc  sne , and thus the cluster - based lower limit of @xmath197 ( maoz et al .",
    "2010 ) , discussed above , implies @xmath198 , and possibly even 1:1 .",
    "de plaa et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , comparing cluster element abundances to theoretical sn element yields , have deduced an integrated cc  sn to sn  ia ratio of 1:1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observational uncertainties are such that a time - integrated cc  sn to sn  ia ratio of roughly 3:1 , despite some tension , is consistent both with cluster measurements and with the loss data we have analysed here .",
    "to test our dtd recovery procedure and examine its performance on different kinds of input datasets , we have repeated the monte - carlo mock survey generation described in  2 , above , using the loss - sdss galaxy sample and its vespa - based sfhs ( with one dust parameter ) .",
    "however , rather than inputing the best - fit dtd from the inversion of the real data , we can choose other model dtds and convolve those dtds with @xmath31 according to eq .",
    "[ discreteconvolution][riti ] , or we can change the sample properties in additional ways , as described below . using the actual loss galaxy sfhs and visibility times ( as opposed to , for example , random sfhs and visibility times )",
    "makes for a more realistic simulation . as before ,",
    "the number of sne found in each galaxy in each mock survey is drawn from a poisson distribution with expectation value @xmath42 .",
    "the different - shaped dtds which can be input and recovered can also be scaled up or down to produce a larger or smaller total number of sne in the mock survey ( or , equivalently , the visibility times , @xmath39 , can be scaled up or down ) . in these simulations ,",
    "the sfhs are assumed to be error - free independent variables , and are used both for creating the mock samples and deriving their dtd .",
    "therefore , these simulations will not display the `` leakage '' between bins that we have encountered with the loss - sdss sample , nor other problems due to systematic or random errors in the sfhs of the galaxies .    from our simulations ,",
    "we find that the distribution of output dtd amplitudes is centered on the input dtd values , meaning that the method reliably recovers the input dtd with little bias .",
    "nonetheless , for low dtd amplitudes combined with large uncertainties ( due to small sn numbers , see below ) , there can be some `` pile - up '' in the distribution at zero amplitude , as a result of the positivity constraint of the dtd .",
    "thus , obtaining a zero amplitude for a bin in the dtd reconstruction can happen , even when in reality the amplitude is nonzero but low , and the number of sne in the survey is small .",
    "we find that the relative uncertainty in the dtd amplitude in the @xmath30th bin scales roughly as one would expect from poisson statistics , considering the number of sne that contribute to every bin in the dtd .",
    "for example , with three time bins , the relative error in the first bin of the dtd is @xmath199 for a survey with a fixed total number of sne , @xmath55 , there will thus be a tradeoff in the analysis between dtd accuracy and resolution .",
    "the uncertainties do not depend on the number of galaxies monitored , and thus a brief - duration survey of many galaxies and a long - duration survey of few galaxies are equivalent , as long as they produce the same total number of sne .",
    "power law ( dashed line ) .",
    "points are plotted at the value of the input binned dtd , and error bars show the ranges that include 68% of the recovered best - fit solutions in repeated random realizations of sn surveys on the mock sample.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure  [ totalloss ] examines the quality of the reconstruction as the number of time bins is varied between three and five . here , we have assumed a survey with 15,000 galaxies and @xmath200 sne , similar to the full loss sn  ia sample , if all galaxies in it had sfh reconstructions available . to produce this large mock sample , we simply clone several times the 3505 sfhs and visibility times of the loss - sdss sample , with its three time bins . to obtain a sample with five time bins in each galaxy s sfh , we have split , in this example , the first sfh bin into two bins : a 0100  myr bin and a 100420  myr bin .",
    "the stellar mass in each sub - bin was randomised by @xmath201% around the mass value corresponding to the relative time fractions .",
    "( such randomisation is essential , as otherwise the @xmath31 are no longer independent variables . ) .",
    "similarly , we further split the last bin into two bins , corresponding to 2.46.5  gyr and 6.513.5  gyr .",
    "for the dtd in these simulations , we have taken a @xmath202 dependence ( which is roughly generic to dd models ; see  [ comparisontomodels ] , above ) , scaled so as to give the desired total number of sne using the loss visibility times .",
    "the simulations show that surveys with several hundred sne enable reasonably good dtd recovery in terms of both accuracy and temporal resolution .",
    "specifically , figure  [ totalloss ] demonstrates that already - existing sn surveys , and loss in particular , have the power to measure reliably the sn  ia dtd , _ if _ the sfhs could be estimated in a comprehensive and unbiased way for the full sample of @xmath203 galaxies .",
    "we briefly discuss the prospects for this in the concluding section , below .",
    "we have gauged the effect of the time binning on the time integral over the dtd , @xmath147 , as approximated in eq .",
    "[ nmsum ] . to do this ,",
    "we create mock samples using large numbers of bins in the sfh and the dtd .",
    "the mock samples also have a large number of sne in order to minimise the statistical error and isolate the systematic effect due to the binning .",
    "we then rebin the sfhs of the sample into the same three coarse time bins we have used for the loss - sdss analysis , and we recover the dtd binned into those same three time intervals .",
    "finally , we compare the integrals @xmath147 over the input dtd and the recovered dtd .",
    "we find that the @xmath147 of the recovered dtd systematically underestimates the input @xmath147 by 1020% , with the larger values for input dtds that rise more steeply at small delays .",
    "this systematic error is comparable to the statistical errors in @xmath147 we have found for the loss - dtd sample .",
    "larger sn samples will naturally allow finer temporal binning of the dtd , reducing this systematic effect .",
    "we have presented a method to recover the sn dtd by jointly analysing sn survey data and reconstructed sfhs of the individual galaxies in a survey , while accounting for the small - number , poisson - statistical nature of sn events in those individual galaxies .",
    "our method is an improvement over previous ones in that it uses the full information contained in the data and avoids unnecessary averaging .",
    "the method is based on casting the expected sn numbers in each galaxy in the survey as a set of linear equations , in which the parameters to be constrained by the data are the values of the dtd in binned time intervals .",
    "we have shown a maximum - likelihood method by which to invert those equations to recover the dtd , and demonstrated the method s performance using simulated mock samples .",
    "we have applied the method to a sample consisting of those galaxies in the loss sn survey that have sdss - vespa sfh reconstructions , along with the sne that these galaxies have hosted during the loss .",
    "the recovered dtds for cc  sne and sne  ia are limited by poisson statistics , because of the small numbers of sne in this restricted subset of loss , and by systematic errors , because for many galaxies the light within the sdss fibre aperture does not reliably represent the full stellar population of the galaxy and its sfh . despite these shortcomings , we are able to make the following statements based on analysis of these data .",
    "+ ( 1 ) a `` prompt '' sn  ia population , defined here as one that explodes within 420  myr of star formation , exists at @xmath204% confidence .",
    "this confirms the growing number of reports of such a population , at levels similar to those found here .",
    "+ ( 2 ) we clearly detect , at the @xmath3 level , a `` delayed '' sn  ia population with delays in the range 2.413  gyr , and a mean rate over this interval of @xmath205 sne yr@xmath96 per @xmath206 formed , or @xmath207 sne yr@xmath96 per remaining @xmath206 in an old population .",
    "these first two conclusions together indicate that the sn  ia dtd peaks at short delays , but extends over a broad range of delay times , out to at least several gyr .",
    "progenitor models , a few of which we have briefly compared to our recovered dtd , will need to reproduce the observed numbers .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the time - integrated sn  ia yield is @xmath208 sne per unit solar mass formed , or @xmath209 sne  ia per remaining unit solar mass in an old population .",
    "the best - fit value is a factor of 1.53 lower than the corresponding number in galaxy clusters , as deduced from their measured iron - to - stellar mass ratios .",
    "although the current uncertainties can still accommodate this difference , it may indicate that clusters underwent additional enrichment by cc  sne from an early stellar population with a top - heavy imf , or that sn  ia production is more efficient in galaxy clusters than in the field .",
    "the latter possibility has support both from direct cluster sn rate measurements and from cluster element abundance analysis .",
    "the measured time - integrated sn  ia yield also implies @xmath210 for the exploding fraction among the parent population of sn  ia primaries , if assumed to come from the 38 m@xmath6 initial mass range .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the time - integrated cc  sn yield is @xmath211 sne per unit solar mass formed .",
    "this rules out low - mass limits for cc explosions that are much above 8  m@xmath6 .",
    "conversely , scenarios in which a significant fraction of high - mass stars end their evolution without sn explosions are excluded , unless the low - mass limit for core collapse is significantly below 8 m@xmath6 .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the ratio of cc  sn to sn  ia numbers from a brief burst of star formation , integrated over a hubble time , is @xmath212 .",
    "our work points to the kinds of data that would improve upon these results .",
    "first , a larger sample of survey galaxies with spectroscopy , and hence sfhs , would obviously reduce the poisson errors and permit better temporal resolution . as there are 14882 galaxies monitored by loss , obtaining spectra for most or all of them would be a large , but not impossible , task .",
    "a dedicated or partly dedicated 24  m - class telescope could achieve this on a few - year timescale .",
    "long - slit spectra , drifted across the galaxy perpendicular to the slit length , would be more representative of the entire stellar population of each galaxy , largely avoiding the small - fibre - aperture problem we have encountered .",
    "ideally , instead of long - slit spectra of the loss galaxies , one would obtain integral - field spectroscopy of each of these galaxies ( using , e.g. , an instrument such as sauron on the william herschel 4.2  m telescope ; bacon et al .",
    "in addition to including the full sfh of each galaxy without any aperture losses , such data , in the context of our method , would easily allow breaking up each galaxy into independent subunits , and considering the sfh of each subunit in relation to the sne that it hosted ( or , for almost all subunits , the sne that it did not host ) .",
    "it might be objected at this point , that because of the random stellar velocities in each galaxy , sn progenitor stars diffuse away from the regions where they were formed , and that this would invalidate our approach ; by the time a sn  ia exploded , it would reside within a region that is completely different from the one in which its progenitor was formed . while this is true , and it would in fact invalidate a traditional `` sn delay time '' analysis in which a single characteristic stellar population age is assigned to a region , it is inconsequential to our current method , in which the entire sfh of the region is considered .",
    "the reason is that the same spatial diffusion affects both the progenitor population and those stars among it that eventually explode . to see this ,",
    "consider , as a toy example , a grid of @xmath213 adjacent `` cells '' in a particular galaxy .",
    "suppose , for example , that 500  myr ago there was a short burst of star formation in the central cell , forming a stellar mass @xmath214 , and no activity in the other cells .",
    "suppose , further , that the sn dtd is such that the stellar population formed in the burst leads , 500  myr later , to nine sne over the course of a decade , which are therefore detected in this galaxy by a sn survey such as loss ( this is admittedly a somewhat unrealistically large number of sne , but is used here just for the sake of illustration ) .",
    "the galaxy has thus produced a ratio of @xmath215 sne per unit stellar mass formed 500  myr ago .",
    "finally , suppose that the stellar diffusion timescale in the galaxy is such that , over the 500  myr , the progenitors of the 9 sne , before exploding , have drifted out of the central cell in which they were formed , and there is now , on average , one sn in each cell .",
    "however , the entire stellar population of the burst will have diffused in the same way , and therefore each cell will have 1/9 of the 500-myr - old population that was originally in the central cell .",
    "when we compare sn numbers to the 500  myr - old stellar mass present today in each cell , we will see 1 sn per @xmath216 of stellar mass formed . in the dtd we derive , we will therefore still deduce the correct ratio of @xmath217 sne per unit stellar mass formed 500  myr earlier .",
    "this argument holds , no matter what are the lookback times or the diffusion timescales .",
    "it also holds for arbitrarily complex sfhs , which can be viewed as linear superpositions in space and in time of toy models of the type above . if a past starburst at a certain place and time in a galaxy produces sne that are observed in the course of a survey , the stellar population of the burst and the sne that it produces will both diffuse in the same way .",
    "if , on the other hand , a specific burst does not produce sne detected by the survey ( because the dtd has a low amplitude at the corresponding delay ) , then there will be no correlation between the number of sne per cell and the mass of stars of that age per cell .",
    "an individual cell hosting sne may , of course , include unrelated stellar populations that did not produce those sne , but whose stars nonetheless drifted into the cell .",
    "however , over the entire galaxy , there will be no correlation between sne and stars of that particular age , and it is such correlations that drive the results of our dtd recovery method .",
    "we note that for the integral - field spectroscopy approach to work , the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra of each individual galaxy cell needs to be sufficiently high for a reliable sfh reconstruction to be obtained .",
    "in particular , the presence of old stellar populations that are superimposed on younger and more luminous stars must be detectable .",
    "naturally , spatially resolved , medium - spectral - resolution data of such a large sample of nearby galaxies would find many additional applications , and hence such data are worth the large effort required .    shortly before submission of this work , brandt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) presented a dtd reconstruction analysis of a different sn sample .",
    "their methodology shares several elements with ours .",
    "brandt et al . ( 2010 ) study 107 sne  ia from sdss - ii .",
    "like us , they use vespa to derive sfhs for a sample of sdss galaxies , binned into three time bins , identical to those we have chosen .",
    "like us , they treat the dtd amplitudes in the three discrete bins as free parameters , which are determined by a maximum - likelihood procedure .",
    "however , rather than comparing directly the presence or absence of sne in each galaxy to the predictions of the dtd model ( as we have ) , they use the dtd to create mock sn - host samples , and compare the mean spectrum of the mock host samples to the mean spectrum of the real host galaxies .",
    "brandt et al . ( 2010 ) reach similar conclusions to ours , namely , significant detections of both prompt ( @xmath1  myr ) and delayed ( @xmath4  gyr ) sn  ia dtd components .",
    "we thank rita tojeiro for her assistance and patience with obtaining and explaining the vespa sfhs , jesse leaman for his contribution to the determination of loss sn rates , and keren sharon for her help with the comparison to models .",
