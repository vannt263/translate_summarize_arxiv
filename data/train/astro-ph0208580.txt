    "migration has entered the puzzling scenario of planetary formation as the favorite mechanism advocated to explain the extremely short orbital period of many extrasolar planets .",
    "it is known that any planet - like body is forced to adjust its distance from the central star because of gravitational interactions with the circumstellar material . however , the dispute about how fast migration proceeds is far from being over .",
    "numerical methods have been employed to evaluate gravitational torques exerted on embedded planets .",
    "we have performed a series of simulations modeling both two and three dimensional disks , varying the mass @xmath0 of the protoplanet in the range from 1 earth - mass to 1 jupiter - mass .",
    "the physics of the problem demands that the flow in the protoplanet s neighborhood should be accurately resolved . in order to achieve sufficient resolution ,",
    "even for very small planetary masses , we use a _ nested - grid _ technique ( dangelo , henning , & kley 2002a ) .",
    "this paper addresses the issues of flow circulation around protoplanets , orbital migration , and mass accretion .",
    "we assume the protostellar disk to be a viscous fluid ( viscosity @xmath1 ) and describe it through the navier - stokes equations ( kley , dangelo , & henning 2001 ; dangelo et al .",
    "the set of equations is integrated over a grid hierarchy , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "the planet is supposed to move on a circular orbit at @xmath2 around a solar - mass star .",
    "the disk has an aspect ratio @xmath3 and the mass within the simulated region is @xmath4 .",
    "a circumplanetary disk forms inside the roche lobe of massive as well as low - mass protoplanets .",
    "such structures are characterized by a two - arm spiral wave perturbation .",
    "they are detached from the circumstellar disk spirals , which arise outside of the planet s roche lobe .",
    "indicating with @xmath5 the distance from the planet normalized to @xmath6 , for a wide range of planetary masses the spiral pattern can be approximated to @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the ratio @xmath10 represents the mach number of the circumplanetary flow .",
    "figure  2 ( left panel ) demonstrates how equation  ( 1 ) fits to the spiral perturbation around a uranus - mass planet .",
    "even an earth - mass planet induces two weak spirals , which wrap around the star for @xmath11 , but no circumplanetary disk is observed ( figure  2 , right panel ) .",
    "= 0.428 = 0.428",
    "= 0.45 = 0.45    = 0.45 = 0.45    a more complete description of the flow near protoplanets is provided by 3d computations ( dangelo , kley , & henning 2002b ) . the major differences between 2d and 3d modeling arise in the vicinity of the planet because the latter can account for the vertical circulation in the circumplanetary disk . instead",
    ", the two geometries decently agree on length scales larger than the disk scale height .",
    "two examples of our simulations are illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "the images represent the logarithm of the density close to a saturn - mass planet ( left ) and neptune - mass planet ( right ) , in two orthogonal planes ( see figure caption for details ) .",
    "the velocity field is overplotted to display the flow features . from the top panels it is clear that the spiral perturbations are weaker and more open than in 2d simulations .",
    "the bottom panels indicate the presence of vertical shock fronts , which are generally located outside the hill sphere of the protoplanet .",
    "in general , torques exerted by disk material cause a protoplanet to migrate toward the star ( ward 1997 ) . yet , nearby matter can be very efficient at slowing down its inward motion ( tanaka , takeuchi , & ward 2002 ; dangelo et al .",
    "the migration time scale can be defined as @xmath12 , where the migration drift @xmath13 is directly proportional to the total torque acting on the planet .",
    "since we also measure the rate @xmath14 at which the planet accretes matter from its surroundings , an accretion time scale can be introduced as well : @xmath15 .",
    "some of our 2d and 3d outcomes for both time scales are shown in figure  4 .",
    "circumplanetary disk forms around protoplanets .",
    "the spiral wave pattern which marks such disks is less accentuated when the full 3d structure is simulated .",
    "vertical shock fronts develop outside the hill sphere of the planet .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath16 in 3d are longer than those predicted by analytical linear theories because of non - linearity effects .",
    "when @xmath17 , both @xmath16 and @xmath18 are longer in 3d computations then they are in 2d ones .",
