    "at the end of 2011 , both the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have seen some excess of events of a possible higgs candidate in the decays of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels .",
    "if one scrutinizes more closely these channels , one may notice that the excessive channels exhibit some correlations , even though it is still too early to say anything concrete .",
    "the higgs boson hunt is now heating up again in 2012 as lhc is slightly upgraded to run at 8 tev .",
    "further updates from both cms and atlas were announced on july 4 , 2012 @xcite .",
    "the diphoton production rate is about a factor of @xmath3 higher than that of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , while the @xmath4 and @xmath5 rates are consistent with the sm higgs boson within uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , the observed rates are consistent with either the sm higgs boson or some other higgs models .",
    "the @xmath6 events collected by cms and atlas can be divided into two categories : inclusive @xmath7 and exclusive @xmath8 ( though both experiments have more refined sub - divisions among various classes of events . )",
    "presumably , the inclusive @xmath7 events include all production channels such as gluon fusion , vector - boson fusion , associated production , etc , among which gluon fusion dominates for production of the sm higgs boson and most of the models considered in this work , except for the fermiophobic higgs boson . on the other hand",
    ", exclusive @xmath8 events mainly come from vector - boson fusion and associated production , which can be further disentangled by jet - tagging techniques .",
    "the vector - boson fusion produces energetic forward jets while associated production produces jets with @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the current evidence of the higgs boson in the diphoton channel comes mainly from inclusive @xmath7 events , simply because the inclusive event rate is much higher than the exclusive @xmath11 event rate .",
    "the main goal of this work is to test a number of models , which have been proposed to explain the excess in the inclusive higgs diphoton events ( the current evidence ) , using the exclusive @xmath11 channel in vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) .",
    "the exclusive vbf events with @xmath11 in the final state are selected using the forward jet - tagging techniques which will be explained shortly .",
    "we will first choose the parameter - space region of each model that can account for the excess in the _ inclusive _ diphoton rate , and then in that region of parameter space we calculate the _ exclusive _ @xmath12 vbf production rates .",
    "we found that the exclusive @xmath11 production rate in vbf channel can give more information to help in distinguishing a number of popular models .",
    "this is the main result of our study .",
    "we summarize a number of models that have been used to account for the excess in the inclusive @xmath7 data as follows .    1 .",
    "the sm higgs boson is still believed to be the most desirable candidate .",
    "it is still consistent with the data within uncertainty .",
    "2 .   the lighter higgs boson of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) can acquire a large radiative correction from the top - stop sector to achieve a mass of 125 gev , though it has been shown rather difficult to achieve an enhanced diphoton rate @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible when one of the staus is light enough , just above the lep limit , and so the diphoton branching ratio is enhanced .",
    "3 .   one of cp - even higgs bosons in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) can account for the observed 125 gev boson with an enhanced diphoton rate @xcite .",
    "it could be the lightest or the second lightest one .",
    "the @xmath13-extended mssm ( umssm ) is also possible to account for the observed boson @xcite .",
    "the analyses for these extended mssm models are much more involved and deserve dedicated studies .",
    "we shall not pursue them in this work .",
    "the lighter cp - even higgs boson of the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite , which has enough free parameters in the model that allows one to achieve a large branching ratio into @xmath14 .",
    "5 .   in the fermiophobic ( fp )",
    "higgs boson model , the higgs boson is only responsible to generate the masses to @xmath15 and @xmath16 bosons while the fermion masses are generated by some other means . since",
    "the fp higgs boson does not couple to the quarks , it can not be produced via gluon fusion at hadronic colliders , but only through the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) and the associated production with a vector boson . nevertheless , the fp higgs boson lighter than 130 gev has a much larger branching ratio into diphoton , such that it can still account for the observed inclusive diphoton rate at the lhc @xcite .",
    "6 .   in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that the randall - sundrum ( rs ) radion , with enhanced couplings to @xmath17 and @xmath14 due to trace anomaly , can explain the excess in the inclusive diphoton production rate and suppressed @xmath18 and @xmath19 rates , which provides the most economical alternative solution to explain the observed data .",
    "7 .   the inert - higgs - doublet model ( ihdm ) @xcite , which is a special case of 2hdm , in which one of the doublets entirely decouples from the leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons while the other one takes on the role of the sm higgs doublet",
    ". the production rate of the higgs boson is the same as the sm one .",
    "however , the decay width of @xmath20 can be enhanced by the presence of the charged higgs boson in the loop .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the diphoton production rate can be enhanced by a factor of about @xmath21 .",
    "there may also be some possibilities that the sm - like higgs boson first decays into two light scalar or pseudoscalar bosons , followed by subsequent decays into collimated pairs of photons , which appear as two photons in the final state @xcite .",
    "we shall not pursue this kind of possibilities in this work .",
    "on the other hand , instead of top - down approaches , it would also be useful to reversely determine the couplings and the nature of the observed 125 gev particle by studying all the available data @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of gluon fusion is that it is not clear what particles and their masses running in the triangle loop . in some models ,",
    "the contribution from a particular charged particle can increase or decrease the diphoton decay width , depending on the relative signs .",
    "for example , in the supersymmetric models , there are additional sfermions , charginos , charged higgs bosons running in the loop , and therefore resulting in complicated dependence on the model parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of using @xmath18 fusion or associated production with a @xmath15 or a @xmath16 boson is that the production diagram is clean and directly testing the couplings of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath18 fusion has a cross section at least a factor of 2 larger than the associated production .",
    "we therefore focus on @xmath18 fusion in this work .",
    "the @xmath18 fusion can be extracted by the presence of two energetic forward jets .",
    "we can impose selection cuts to select jets in forward rapidity and high energy region @xcite . by combining the production rates in the inclusive @xmath7 and exclusive @xmath11 channels , one can obtain useful information about the nature of the 125 gev new particle recently observed at the lhc .    in this work , we calculate the event rates in the @xmath18 fusion channel for a number of models that have been used to interpret the current lhc data of the 125 gev `` higgs boson '' . the theoretical cleanliness of @xmath18 fusion has been explained in the last paragraph .",
    "we believe that the @xmath18 fusion channel can help discriminating among various models .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly highlight a number of models in the next section , and the @xmath18 fusion and selection cuts in sec .",
    "we give the decay branching ratios in sec .",
    "iv and production rates in sec .",
    "v. we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "the sm higgs boson is still the most favorable candidate to interpret the observed boson , though the experimental data showed slightly excess in inclusive @xmath24 events over the prediction of the sm higgs boson @xcite .",
    "production of the sm higgs boson is dominated by gluon fusion , which is an order of magnitude larger than the next important mechanism ",
    "there are two higgs doublets instead of just one in the 2hdm . in order to avoid dangerous tree level flavor - changing neutral currents ,",
    "the popular 2hdms are imposed a discrete symmetry . in the type",
    "i , all of the fermions couple to a single higgs doublet , and do not couple to the second doublet ; while in the type ii , one doublet couples only to down - type quarks and another doublet couples to the up - type quarks . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the type ii , which has the same higgs sector as the mssm .",
    "the higgs sector consists of two higgs doublets @xmath25 where the subscripts @xmath26 denote the right - handed quark singlet field that the higgs doublet couples to .",
    "the electroweak symmetry is broken when the higgs doublet fields develop the following vevs : @xmath27 physically , there are two cp - even , one cp - odd , and a pair of charged higgs bosons after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , and the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bosons as well as the sm fermions , except for neutrinos , acquire masses .",
    "the yukawa couplings and masses for fermions can be obtained from the following yukawa interactions after ewsb @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the parameters of the model in the cp - conserving case include @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mixing angle between the two cp - even higgs bosons .",
    "there are enough free parameters in the higgs potential such that all the above parameters are free inputs to the model , in contrast to the mssm where the higgs potential is highly restricted by supersymmetry in addition to gauge symmetry .",
    "the couplings of the two lighter and heavier cp - even higgs bosons @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively and the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath34 to the top , bottom quarks , and taus are given by , with a common factor of @xmath35 being suppressed , @xmath36 while the charged higgs @xmath37 couples to @xmath38 and @xmath39 via @xmath40 \\;.\\ ] ] other relevant couplings in @xmath18 fusion are those to gauge bosons are given by , @xmath41    dominant production of the light cp - even higgs boson @xmath32 at the lhc is via gluon fusion , similar to the sm higgs boson with the top quark running in the loop ; however , in the large @xmath42 region the bottom - quark contribution can also be substantial .",
    "since the bottom - yukawa coupling can be substantially enhanced , the gluon fusion cross section can be larger than the sm .",
    "on the other hand , since the couplings of the @xmath32 to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are simply the sm values multiplied by @xmath43 , @xmath18 fusion cross sections are in general smaller than the sm .",
    "the decay into two photons is somewhat more complicated than the sm .",
    "besides the couplings @xmath22 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are different , there are also the charged higgs bosons running in the loop .",
    "the charged higgs boson couples to the light cp - even higgs with the coupling @xcite @xmath46 however , the @xmath47 and b meson mixing constraints require the charged higgs boson mass @xmath48 gev for intermediate to large values of @xmath42 @xcite",
    ". we will choose @xmath49 gev in our analysis below .",
    "the overall diphoton production rate @xmath50 in gluon fusion can easily vary between @xmath51 of the sm prediction depending on parameters @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the enhancement in branching ratio can be obtained roughly along @xmath52 near zero for all @xmath42 in the type ii model .",
    "we will choose parameter space points there to illustrate .      in order to achieve a mass of 125 gev for the lighter cp - even higgs boson ,",
    "a very large radiative correction is needed , which essentially comes from top - stop loop .",
    "the approximate formula for the lighter cp - even higgs boson is given by @xcite @xmath53\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 tev is the susy scale .",
    "a large @xmath56 is needed to generate a large correction . here",
    "we follow the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite for the parameter space : we choose @xmath57 gev , @xmath58 tev , @xmath59 tev , and @xmath60 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the mssm parameter space based on bayesian statistical analysis in light of the new observation of the 125 gev higgs candidate is also presented recently in ref .",
    "the reason behind such a large @xmath42 is the stau contribution to the diphoton branching ratio explained below @xcite .    in the production part via gluon fusion , the difference between the sm and supersymmetric models is that squarks also run in the triangle loop . as the experimental data have pushed the squark masses of the first two generations to be quite heavy but not the third generation ( stop and sbottom ) the change in production rates could be substantial , especially in large @xmath42 . on the other hand , the decay into diphoton is more involved in susy models .",
    "all charged particles , including squarks , sleptons , charginos , charged higgs boson can flow in the triangle loop . with the present constraints from experiments ,",
    "the production rate into diphoton ( equal to production cross section times the branching ratio into diphoton ) in the mssm is shown to be very similar to the sm one and that the diphoton production rate can hardly be enhanced by more than a factor of @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the formulas for the decay of the higgs boson into two photons as well as production via gluon fusion can be found in ref .",
    "the couplings of the lighter cp - even higgs boson to the @xmath18 or @xmath19 are given by the sm ones multiplied by @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the production rate in the @xmath18 fusion is in general similar to or smaller than the sm prediction .",
    "we look at the parameter space in which the diphoton production rate would be larger than the sm value in the mssm .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that diphoton production rate can be larger than the sm one if one pushes the stau to be very light , just above the lep limit .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned soft parameters , the other parameters are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and the @xmath65 . without loss of generality",
    "we choose @xcite @xmath66 in which we can scan for the diphoton production rate @xmath67 to be larger than the sm rate .",
    "the region essentially gives a light stau , which can enhance the @xmath68 .",
    "we will scan the region according to eq .",
    "( [ stau ] ) and require the mass of the lighter cp - even higgs boson around 125 gev and the diphoton production rate larger than the sm value .      with the name `` fermiophobic '' ( fp ) the higgs boson only couples to the vector bosons at tree level , though higher - loop corrections can induce small couplings to fermions .",
    "in this case , the yukawa couplings and masses of fermions are generated by some other mechanisms , which are not of concern in this work .",
    "the coupling strength of the fp higgs boson to vector bosons is the same as that of the sm higgs boson .",
    "we write the interactions as @xmath69 since the fp higgs boson does not couple to quarks , it can not be produced dominantly by gluon fusion at hadronic colliders , but only through the vector boson fusion and the associated production with a @xmath70 boson .",
    "the corresponding production cross sections are the same as the vbf of the sm higgs boson . nevertheless , the fp higgs boson lighter than 130 gev has a much larger branching ratio into diphoton , such that it can still account for the observed diphoton rate at the lhc @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons : ( i ) the fp higgs boson decay into fermions is highly suppressed with only the loop - induced couplings , and ( ii ) the decay into photons is via a loop of @xmath15 boson without the negative interference from the top quark . thus , the branching ratio into diphoton can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "overall , the diphoton production rate at the lhc is comparable to the sm higgs boson , as was used to account for the observed boson @xcite",
    ". an earlier study of fp higgs boson at the lhc can be found in ref .",
    "there is basically no free parameters in this model .      the rs model @xcite used a warped 5d space - time , a slice of the symmetric space @xmath71 , to explain the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the extra dimension @xmath72 is a single @xmath73 orbifold with one hidden and one visible 3-brane localized at @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "it was pointed out by goldberger and wise @xcite that the original rs model has a four - dimensional massless scalar ( the modulus or radion ) which does not have a potential and therefore the extra dimension can not be stabilized .",
    "a stabilization mechanism was proposed in @xcite by adding a bulk scalar field propagating in the background solution which can generate a potential to stabilize the modulus field .",
    "the minimum of the potential can be arranged to give the desired value of @xmath76 to solve the gauge hierarchy problem without extreme fine tuning of parameters . as a consequence ,",
    "the lightest excitation mode of the modulus field is the radion , which has a mass of the order of 100 gev to a tev , and the strength of its coupling to the sm fields is of the order of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "phenomenology of the stabilized radion and its effects on the background geometry were studied in @xcite .",
    "the interactions of the stabilized modulus ( radion ) @xmath78 with the sm particles on the visible brane are completely determined by 4-dimensional general covariance .",
    "thus the radion lagrangian is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is of the order of tev and @xmath81 is the trace of the sm energy - momentum stress tensor , which has the following lowest order terms @xmath82 the coupling of the radion to a pair of gluons ( photons ) is induced at one loop level , with the dominated contributions coming from the heavy top quark ( top quark and @xmath15 ) as well as from the trace anomaly in qcd ( qed ) .",
    "the expressions of the induced couplings can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "similar to the sm higgs boson , the dominant production channel for the radion is via @xmath17 fusion , followed by vbf @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath83 gets substantial enhancement from the trace anomaly . for the decay of the radion",
    ", it is dominated by the @xmath17 mode instead of @xmath84 at the low mass region , while its diphoton branching ratio is merely a fraction of the sm value of @xmath85 .",
    "overall , the diphoton production rate @xmath86 can be larger than the sm rate if the scale @xmath87 is small enough , and as long as it is consistent with the search for rs graviton . if we do not concern about naturalness , the scale @xmath87 can be as small as 0.8 tev . in this work ,",
    "we fix the scale @xmath87 to be @xmath88 tev , which can enhance the diphoton production rate in gluon fusion by a factor of @xmath89 @xcite relative to the sm rate .",
    "note that the branching ratios of the radion is independent of @xmath87 .",
    "ihdm is a special case of 2hdm , in which one of the doublets takes on the role of the sm higgs doublet , while the other one is inert which means that it entirely decouples from the sm leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons .",
    "the model also has an additional @xmath90 symmetry , for which all sm particles are even , except for the particle content of the second inert higgs doublet .",
    "the lightest @xmath90-odd particle of the second doublet can work as a candidate of dark matter .",
    "the higgs sector consists of @xmath91 the electroweak symmetry is broken solely by one vev : @xmath92 the higgs potential is given by @xmath93\\ ] ] physically , there are 2 cp - even scalars @xmath94 , 1 cp - odd scalar @xmath95 , and a pair of charged higgs @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath32 plays the role of the sm higgs boson while the others are inert .",
    "a list of parameters of the model includes @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "production via gluon fusion and via @xmath18 fusion are the same as the sm higgs boson .",
    "however , the decay into @xmath14 receives additional contributions from the @xmath99 running in the loop .",
    "if kinematically allowed the higgs boson @xmath32 can also decay into @xmath100 and @xmath101 . for simplicity and to achieve a large enough branching ratio into @xmath14 we set the masses of @xmath102 to be above the threshold @xmath103 . in this model , the coupling between the charged higgs boson and the sm higgs boson @xmath32 is given by @xmath104 it is clear that from this equation the sign of the charged higgs contribution to the triangular loop can be positive or negative , depending on the sizes of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , if we set @xmath107 , the charged higgs contribution vanishes and so the diphoton branching ratio becomes the same as the sm one .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in gluon fusion the diphoton production rate is determined by the product of gluon - fusion cross section and the @xmath14 branching ratio @xmath108 which can be varied from about @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "the charged higgs contribution to the diphoton branching ratio depends on the sizes of @xmath111 and @xmath106 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that when @xmath112 the diphoton branching ratio is enhanced .",
    "together with other theoretical constraints one can find the region to be @xmath113 gev and @xmath114 .     a feynman diagram showing the vector boson fusion into sm higgs , fp higgs or radion.,width=384 ]",
    "the most distinguished feature of vbf at hadronic colliders is the appearance of two energetic forward jets separated by a large @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the pseudo - rapidity and @xmath78 is the azimuth angle . the feynman diagram is shown in fig .  [ feyn ] .",
    "each of the initial quarks radiates a @xmath70 boson , which further annihilates into the higgs boson or some other particles under consideration .",
    "the unique feature of this process is that the @xmath70 bosons participating in the fusion process is close to on - shell @xcite , and whether the @xmath70 is longitudinal or transverse the scattered quark is very energetic carrying almost all the energy of the incoming quark and very forward @xcite .",
    "this fact justifies the use of effective @xmath15 approximation in all calculations for vbf in the early days .",
    "based on this feature we impose the following experimental cuts in selecting the dijet events coming dominantly from the vbf : @xmath117 and @xmath118 where the subscript `` 1 '' denotes the most energetic jet . in the cut of eq .",
    "( [ jcuts ] ) , we choose either the energy of the most energetic jet @xmath119 gev or the invariant mass of the jet pair @xmath120 gev .",
    "this set of cuts is similar to that used by cms  @xcite and atlas @xcite in their searches for fp higgs boson .",
    "the vector boson fusion is well - known that it allows to probe the direct coupling between the vector bosons and the higgs boson or other particles under consideration .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath17 fusion , because any colored particles can flow in the triangular loop and affect the production rate .",
    "for example , in mssm all squarks can circulate inside the loop .",
    "since the decay branching ratios for the sm higgs boson , fermiophobic higgs boson , and some benchmark points of the mssm are publicly available , we simply use the listed values in literature @xcite . for the other models ( radion , ihdm , 2hdm ) we calculate the branching ratios using exactly the same set of input parameters as the available models , so that a fair comparison is possible .",
    "we employ the full nlo qcd corrections for the decays of @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xcite , and including offshellness in the decays @xmath123 and @xmath124 , with the following @xmath125 and @xmath126 quark pole masses : @xmath127    here we list the decay branching ratio into @xmath14 for the sm higgs boson , fermiophobic higgs boson , and the radion of mass 125 gev in table [ tab1 ] . for the sm higgs boson",
    "the decay into @xmath14 goes through a triangle loop of @xmath15 boson and top quark , between which they interfere destructively .",
    "the sm higgs diphoton branching ratio is about @xmath128 .",
    "this is very different for the fp higgs boson , which allows only the @xmath15 boson flowing in the loop .",
    "thus , the branching ratio of a fp higgs boson into diphoton can be an order of magnitude larger than that of the sm higgs boson , and also because it does not decay into fermions .",
    "that is the reason why it can account for the observed 125 higgs boson at the lhc , even though its gluon fusion production cross section is very small .",
    "the case of the radion is opposite to the fp higgs .",
    "the diphoton branching ratio of the radion is a few times smaller than that of the sm , while its production rate via @xmath17 fusion is substantially enhanced .",
    "we list the branching ratio into @xmath14 for the higgs boson in the ihdm for a number of choices of parameters of the model in table [ tab2 ] , such that the diphoton branching ratio is enhanced relative to the sm one : @xmath113 gev and @xmath114 .",
    "the factors affecting the partial width into @xmath14 are the charged higgs boson mass and the coupling @xmath129 .",
    "the charged higgs loop contribution can interfere either constructively or destructively with the sm contributions .",
    "another factor that would affect the branching ratio into @xmath14 is whether the thresholds into @xmath130 , @xmath131 , or @xmath132 are open .",

    "similar to ihdm , the main factors affecting the partial width into @xmath14 are the charged higgs boson mass and the coupling @xmath129 . the branching ratio , on the other hand , also depends on other parameters such as @xmath42 and @xmath52 as exhibited in the @xmath22 and @xmath44 couplings .",

    "these reconstructed objects are generally referred to as fake photons .",

    "the signal from @xmath20 will be identified as a sharp peak in the @xmath169 distribution , where the background is in continuum . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the background model is derived from data . in the new run at 8 tev , we expect the same treatment is applied to the background .",
    "the estimation of significance of each signal is beyond the scope of the present paper .    given that we have obtained the event rates of each model in the tables , which have been under experimental cuts and simulations ( pgs ) , it is straight - forward to estimate the required luminosity to probe various scenarios . the continuum background at the 7 tev and 8 tev lhc in vbf channel has been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the sm higgs boson has been seen above the background with some significance level in the vbf channel in the current lhc runs ( about 5 fb@xmath170 at 7 tev and aboug 5 fb@xmath170 at 8 tev ) , the scenarios with higher event rates than the sm higgs boson should be detectable .",
    "the projected integrated luminosity at the end of 2012 is about @xmath171 fb@xmath170 for each experiment , it would not be a problem to investigate the scenarios in the vbf channel .",
    "lhc is expected to confirm if there is a new particle at 125 gev by the end of this year .",
    "the likelihood for a new discovery is rather high .",
    "nevertheless , whether this new particle is the sm higgs boson is not an easy question to answer .    in this work ,",
    "the scenario of this 125 gev particle produced by vector boson fusion , instead of gluon fusion as the dominant production mechanism for the standard model higgs boson , is studied in details . by using the forward dijet tagging technique , one can single out the vector boson fusion mechanism .",
    "we studied a number of popular new physics models that have been employed to interpret the observed particle at 125 gev , including fermiophobic higgs boson , the randall - sundrum radion , inert - higgs - doublet model , two - higgs - doublet model , and the mssm .",
    "since the inclusive diphoton channel showed an excess over the sm predictions , we first selected the parameter space of each model that can give an inclusive diphoton rate larger than or equal to the sm rate . then , we calculate the exclusive @xmath12 diphoton production rate in vbf for that parameter space . the results are tabulated in tables ( [ prod1 ] ) - ( [ prod2 ] ) at the parton level and in tables ( [ prod3 ] ) - ( [ prod4 ] ) at the detector - simulation level .",
    "if the diphoton mode excess seen at lhc-7 can be firmly established by the new lhc-8 data , it will be the utmost task to identify the nature of this particle . perhaps , it is simply the sm higgs boson with some level of statistical fluctuation , but it could also be the rs radion @xcite , fermiophobic higgs boson @xcite , the light cp - even higgs boson of the 2hdm @xcite , the higgs boson of the ihdm @xcite , or one of the cp - even higgs bosons in other extensions of the mssm @xcite , all of which can allow an enhancement to the @xmath14 production rate . on the other hand , the vector boson fusion ,",
    "as singled out by the dijet tag , provides useful information in helping to differentiate among various models .",
    "it is not hard by browsing through tables ( [ prod3 ] ) and ( [ prod4 ] ) or fig .",
    "[ ratio ] to conclude the following ( here `` excess '' means excess over the sm higgs boson prediction ) :    * if a similar rate is seen in inclusive production but no large excess is seen in the exclusive vbf production it would unlikely be a fermiophobic higgs boson . *",
    "if a similar rate or excess is seen in inclusive production but some events are seen in exclusive vbf production rate , it would unlikely be the rs radion . *",
    "if moderate excess is seen in both inclusive production and exclusive vbf production , it could be the higgs boson of the ihdm , 2hdm , or the mssm .",
    "however , if the excess is over 60% it will pose severe challenge to the mssm .",
    "it seems easy to rule out either fermiophobic higgs boson or rs radion , providing that we see no large excess or some events in vbf channel , respectively .",
    "however , it is still difficult to distinguish the other models when the inclusive and exclusive rates are similar to or slightly larger than the sm values . if the production rate of the diphoton mode at 125 gev lines up with the sm prediction eventually , it is still premature to conclude this is coming from the sm higgs boson .",
    "other alternatives in mssm , nmssm , or other susy models can also be mimicking the sm higgs boson , depending on the parameter space of the new physics model . in any case , once the signals at 125 gev are confirmed further studies including all possible decay modes are to be taken into account in order to discriminate these many alternatives beyond the standard model .",
    "vector boson fusion is the next most important production mechanism that must be taken into account to fully identify the newly discovered particle .",

    "<S> the hint of a new particle around 125 gev at the lhc through the decay modes of diphoton and a number of others may point to quite a number of possibilities . while at the lhc the dominant production mechanism for the higgs boson of the standard model and some other extensions is via the gluon fusion process , the alternative vector boson fusion is more sensitive to electroweak symmetry breaking through the gauge - higgs couplings and therefore can be used to probe for models beyond the standard model . in this work , using the well known dijet - tagging technique to single out the vector boson fusion mechanism , we investigate its capability to discriminate a number of models that have been suggested to give an enhanced inclusive diphoton production rate , including the standard model higgs boson , fermiophobic higgs boson , randall - sundrum radion , inert - higgs - doublet model , two - higgs - doublet model , and the mssm . </S>",
