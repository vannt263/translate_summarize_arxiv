    "this paper develops and analyzes interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( ipdg ) methods for the following time harmonic maxwell problem : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a bounded domain with lipschitz continuous boundary @xmath6 and of diameter @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the unit outward normal to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the imaginary unit , and @xmath11 , the _ tangential component _ of the electric field @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath1 , called _ wave number _ , is a positive constant and @xmath13 is known as the impedance constant .",
    "is the standard impedance boundary condition .",
    "assume that @xmath14 , hence , @xmath15 .",
    "problem  is a prototypical problem in electromagnetic scattering ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) and",
    "has been used extensively as a model ( and benchmark ) problem to develop various numerical discretization methods including finite element methods @xcite and discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite , and to develop fast solvers ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the above maxwell problem with large wave number @xmath1 is numerically difficult to solve mainly because of the following two reasons .",
    "first , the large wave number @xmath1 implies the small wave length @xmath16 , that is , the wave is a short wave and very oscillatory .",
    "it is well known that , in every coordinate direction , one must put some minimal number of grid points in each wave length in order to resolve the wave .",
    "using such a fine mesh evidently results in a huge algebraic problem to solve regardless what discretization method is used .",
    "practically ,  the rule of thumb \" is to use @xmath17 grid points per wave length , which means that the mesh size @xmath0 must satisfy the constraint @xmath18 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no numerical method in the literature has been proved to be uniquely solvable and to have an error bound under the mesh constraint @xmath18 for the above maxwell problem . moreover , numerical experiments have shown that under the mesh condition @xmath18 the errors of all existing numerical methods grow as the wave number @xmath1 increases .",
    "this means that the error is not completely controlled by the product @xmath19 and it provides strong evidences of the existence of so - called  pollution \" in the error bounds .",
    "it is known now @xcite that the existence of pollution is related to the loss of stability of numerical methods with large wave numbers for the scalar wave equation , which is also expected to be the case for the vector wave equations .",
    "second , for large wave number @xmath1 , the maxwell operator is strongly indefinite .",
    "such a strong indefiniteness certainly passes onto any discretization of the maxwell problem .",
    "in other words , the stiffness matrix of the discrete problem is not only very large but also strongly indefinite .",
    "solving such a large , strongly indefinite , and ill - conditioned algebraic problem is proved to be very challenging and all the well - known iterative methods were proved numerically to be either ineffective or divergent for indefinite wave problems in the case of large wave number ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "this paper is an attempt to address the first difficulty mentioned above for the maxwell equations . in particular ,",
    "our goal is to design and analyze discretization methods which have superior stability properties and give optimal rates of convergence for the maxwell problem .",
    "motivated by our previous experiences with the helmholtz equation @xcite , we again try to accomplish the goal by developing some interior penalty discontinuous galerkin method for problem . the focus of the paper is to establish the rigorous stability and error analysis for the proposed ipdg method , in particular , in the preasymptotic regime ( i.e. , when @xmath20 ) . for the ease of presentation and to better present ideas",
    ", we confine ourselves to only consider the linear element in this paper and will discuss its high order extensions in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec-2 ] is devoted to the study of the coercivity of the maxwell operator and the wave - number explicit estimates for the solution of . we show that the sesquilinear form associated with the maxwell problem satisfies a generalized weak coercivity ( i.e. , inf - sup condition ) .",
    "this coercivity in turn readily infers the wave - number explicit solution estimates which were proved in @xcite .",
    "we note that the proofs of both results given in this paper are of independent interest and refer the reader to @xcite for further discussions in the direction .",
    "section [ sec-3 ] presents the construction of our ipdg method and some simple properties of the proposed discrete sesquilinear form .",
    "section [ sec-4 ] studies the coercivity of the discrete sesquilinear form and derives stability estimates for the ipdg solutions .",
    "it is proved that the discrete sesquilinear form satisfies a coercivity for all mesh size @xmath21 and all wave number @xmath22 and for general domains including non - star - shaped ones , which is stronger than the generalized weak coercivity satisfied by its continuous counterpart .",
    "all these are possible because of the special design of the discrete sesquilinear form and the special property @xmath23 ( element - wise ) for all piecewise linear functions @xmath24 .",
    "this coercivity in turn readily infers the well - posedness and stability estimates for the discrete problem without imposing any mesh constraint .",
    "section [ sec-5 ] devotes to the error analysis for the proposed ipdg method . by using the discrete stability estimates and adapting a nonstandard error estimate technique of @xcite",
    ", we derive both the energy - norm and the @xmath2-norm error estimates for the ipdg method in all mesh parameter regimes including pre - asymptotic regime ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) .",

    "<S> this paper develops and analyzes an interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( ipdg ) method using piecewise linear polynomials for the indefinite time harmonic maxwell equations with the impedance boundary condition in the three dimensional space . </S>",
    "<S> the main novelties of the proposed ipdg method include the following : first , the method penalizes not only the jumps of the tangential component of the electric field across the element faces but also the jumps of the tangential component of its vorticity field ; second , the penalty parameters are taken as complex numbers of negative imaginary parts . </S>",
    "<S> for the differential problem , we prove that the sesquilinear form associated with the maxwell problem satisfies a generalized weak stability ( i.e. , inf - sup condition ) for star - shaped domains . </S>",
    "<S> such a generalized weak stability readily infers wave - number explicit a priori estimates for the solution of the maxwell problem , which plays an important role in the error analysis for the ipdg method . for the proposed ipdg method , </S>",

    "<S> , the coercivity easily yields the well - posedness and stability estimates ( i.e. , a priori estimates ) for the discrete problem without imposing any mesh constraint . based on these discrete stability estimates , by adapting a nonstandard error estimate technique of @xcite </S>",
