    "x - ray observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) elucidate many physical processes that drive the production of high - energy photons close to a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "in addition to probing the properties of the corona in radio - quiet agn , x - ray data can constrain the nature of the inner accretion flow by measuring the morphology of the fe k@xmath1 line . this emission line , with a rest energy of @xmath10 for neutral iron , arises via fluorescence from the accretion disk , which is illuminated by the compton - scattered continuum x - rays . given the relatively high cosmic abundance of iron and its high fluorescent yield , coupled with the lack of other lines expected in that part of the spectrum , it is a reasonably `` clean '' probe of the kinematics of the accreting material .",
    "narrow ( usually unresolved by ccd detectors , i.e. , @xmath11 ) fe k@xmath1 lines have been observed in the vast majority of seyfert galaxies ( yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ) .",
    "in addition to their small width , the lack of variability implies that they originate from the illumination by the primary x - ray source of reprocessing material relatively far from the black hole , likely in the outer disk or torus of seyfert unification schemes ( antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , this emission region has been spatially resolved in the seyfert 2 agn ngc  4945 ( marinucci et  al .",
    "2012 ) , and it lies at a distance from the nucleus of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 for the @xmath14 black hole at its core , where @xmath15 )",
    ". the near ubiquity of these features suggests that this distant material is present in almost all seyfert agn . in some seyfert galaxies",
    "the fe k line appears to be broadened ( to @xmath16 ) , most likely by relativistic effects ; e.g. , mcg6 - 30 - 15 , first observed by ( 1995 ) , and recently also confirmed in ngc  1365 ( risaliti et  al .",
    "these sources are two of the best examples of agn displaying a prominent red wing indicative of fluorescing material close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) in the accretion disk .    a broad fe k@xmath1 line originating from material extending to the isco allows us to determine whether the black hole is rotating , and if so , to determine its spin and possibly direction as well ( for recent reviews , see , e.g. , 2013 and 2013 ) .",
    "however , such broad , relativistic emission lines are not observed in all seyferts observed with high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ( nandra et  al . 2007 ; de la calle prez et  al .",
    "2010 ; brenneman et  al .",
    "2012 ) , possibly indicating the absence of relatively cold , compton - thick gas close to the black hole ( though the caveats to line detection detailed in 2010 should also be kept in mind ) .",
    "regardless of the mechanism by which they are determined , any inferences regarding the structure , location , and physical conditions of the accretion disk and the corona require a precise , high s / n measurement of the broad - band x - ray spectrum from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "this is necessary in order to disentangle various emission and absorption components contributing to the total observed x - ray emission , described above .",
    "a significant advance towards such measurements is provided by the deployment of the focusing hard x - ray telescopes onboard the _ nustar _ observatory , the latest in the series of nasa s small explorer satellites .",
    "this mission is sensitive in the bandpass of @xmath19 with the updated calibration , and provides a hundredfold improvement of sensitivity in the hard x - ray band over previous instruments ( harrison et  al .",
    "the use of _ nustar _ in conjunction with x - ray telescopes that are more sensitive at softer energies ( e.g. , _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ ) yields the highest s / n ever achieved across the @xmath20 bandpass .",
    "equally important in deriving the physical properties of the disk and corona is the selection of a representative , bright target .",
    "one good candidate is the southern seyfert 1.2 galaxy ic  4329a ( @xmath21 , 1991 ; @xmath22=4.61",
    "\\times 10^{20 } \\pcmsq$ ] , 2005 ; @xmath23 , 2010 ) , which in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath24-ray band appears similar to an average radio - quiet seyfert ( e.g. , 1996 ) .",
    "the host galaxy is an edge - on spiral in a pair with ic  4329 , separated by @xmath25 arcmin .",
    "ic  4329a was one of the first agn observed to have a compton reflection component in addition to its strong fe k@xmath1 line ( piro , yamauchi , & matsuoka 1990 ) .",
    "as with most other x - ray emitting seyferts , it is variable , but the variability amplitude during a typical observation is modest : the root mean square fractional variability has been measured at @xmath26 in the @xmath27 _ rxte _ band ( markowitz 2009 ) , and @xmath28 in the @xmath29 band with _ swift_/bat ( soldi et  al . 2014 ) .",
    "the average @xmath30 flux historically ranges from @xmath31 ( beckmann et  al .",
    "2006 ; verrecchia et  al .",
    "ic  4329a has been the subject of many x - ray observations , beginning with the analysis of its simultaneous _",

    "1995 ) . in harder x - rays ,",

    "_ asca+rxte _",
    "( done , madejski , & ycki 2000 ) and _ integral _ ( molina et  al .",
    "2013 ) , which have placed rough constraints on the high - energy cutoff of the power - law ( a proxy for coronal temperature ) at @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . combining the non - simultaneous _ integral _ and _ xmm - newton _ data further constrained the cutoff energy to @xmath35 ( molina et  al .",
    "2009 ) , while a combination of the _ xmm _ and _ bepposax _ data yielded @xmath33 ( gondoin et  al .",
    "2001 ) .    a detailed examination of the _ asca _ and simultaneous _ rxte _ data revealed that the continuum is indeed described well by the model used to describe the _ rosat+osse _ data ( either thermal or non - thermal comptonization plus neutral , distant reflection ) , and that the fe k@xmath1 line is moderately broadened and can be described by a gaussian with fwhm of @xmath36 ( done et  al .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions of ( 2007 ) , who noted a moderately broad fe k@xmath1 line of similar width and equivalent widths up to @xmath37 in _ bepposax _ data , paired with measured reflection fractions up to @xmath38 .",
    "both the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data , as well as the _ xmm - newton _ observations ( steenbrugge et  al . 2005 ) , suggest that the soft x - ray spectrum is absorbed by a combination of neutral and partially ionized gas , with a total column of @xmath39 .",
    "this is comparable to the host galaxy s ism column density ( wilson & penston 1979 ) . after accounting for the reflection component",
    ", the source shows some modest spectral variability of the primary continuum , being softer at higher flux levels ( madejski , done , & ycki 2001 ; miyazawa , haba , & kunieda 2009 ; markowitz 2009 ) .    here",
    ", we report on results from our simultaneous _",
    "suzaku _ and _ nustar _ observation of ic  4329a .",
    "we discussed our measurements of the properties of the underlying continuum in ( 2014 ) ( hereafter referred to as paper i ) , and in this work we update those values and focus on constraining the reprocessing components . in  2 , we report on the _ suzaku _ and _ nustar _ observations , and in  3 we present a brief timing analysis of the data .",
    "our spectral analysis follows in  4 , with a discussion of the inferred accretion disk properties and their implications in  5 .",
    "ic  4329a was observed quasi - continuously and contemporaneously by _ suzaku _ and _ nustar _ from august 12 - 16 , 2012 in normal clocking mode .",
    "the observations had a roughly @xmath40 efficiency due to earth occultations . after eliminating earth occultations , passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and other periods of high background , the _ suzaku _ observation totaled @xmath41 of on - source time from august 13 - 15 , while the _ nustar _ observation totaled @xmath42 of on - source time from august 12 - 16 .",

    "suzaku _ and _ nustar _ observations of ic  4329a do not show marked variability on short timescales , as exhibited by many other agn ( e.g. , ngc  1365 , 2013 ) .",
    "nonetheless , it is useful to examine time - sliced spectra from the highest and lowest flux states of the source during our campaign . this exercise yields insight into the changes in certain spectral components driving the change in flux , i.e. , to what degree these flux changes are caused by variations in the continuum , absorption or reflection components .",
    "we extracted simultaneous high- and low - flux spectra from the time intervals in each observation ( _ suzaku_/xis - fi and _ nustar_/fpma ; fpmb are not shown for clarity , but are virtually identical to fpma ) .",
    "these spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : high_low_times ] .",
    "the high - flux state spectra totaled @xmath43 of exposure time and represent the highest source flux with simultaneous data from the two telescopes .",
    "the low - flux state totaled @xmath44 of exposure time , and represents the lowest source flux with simultaneous data from both telescopes .",
    "difference spectra were created by subtracting the low - flux spectra from the high - flux spectra in both _",
    "suzaku_/xis - fi and _ nustar_/fpma .",
    "we show all six spectra plotted against the best - fit power - law modified by galactic photoabsorption in fig .",
    "[ fig : high_low_diff_norefl ] .",
    "note that the difference spectra show no change from the high- and low - state spectra below @xmath45 , indicating the constancy of the warm absorber during our observations .",
    "close inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : high_low_diff_norefl ] also reveals that the reflection features ( fe k band and compton hump above @xmath46 ) are slightly more prominent during the low - flux state when the power - law emission is minimized .",
    "the difference spectra show no residual reflection features , implying that these are constant in flux over the course of the observation .",
    "we can therefore infer that changes in only the power - law flux drive the slight spectral evolution that takes place as ic  4329a transitions from a higher - flux state to a lower - flux state during our campaign .",
    "the source is softer when brighter , as is typical in many actively accreting agn : @xmath47 in the high - flux state ( @xmath48 ) vs. @xmath49 in the low - flux state ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this observed relation is thought to arise due to a correlation between the mass accretion rate and power - law slope , wherein higher accretion rates result in steeper spectra .",
    "this result can be explained if the compton amplification factor decreases proportionally with the accretion rate in agn ( e.g. , & papadakis 2009 and references therein ) , though note all agn display this behavior ( e.g. , ngc  4151 ; 2010 ) .",
    "the cutoff energy of the power - law in our data does not vary significantly from its best - fit value between the high- and low - flux spectra , and can not be constrained in the difference spectrum .",
    "the difference spectrum is well fit by a power - law modified by both galactic and intrinsic absorption , much like that described in the model  1 .",
    "this power - law has a slope of @xmath51 and a normalization of @xmath52 .",
    "in our deep observation of ic  4329a , performed simultaneously with _",
    "suzaku _ and _ nustar _ , we are able to robustly separate the continuum , absorption and distant reflection components in the spectrum using the broad energy range of our observations . the results of our analysis can be summarized as follows :    * ic  4329a was viewed in a flux state near its historical average , and displayed little variability on short timescales and @xmath53 variability over the course of the campaign , * as has been found in previous x - ray observations*. * while we were able to place a strong constraint on the presence of a broadened fe k@xmath1 line in the data ( @xmath54 in model  1 , the highest equivalent width seen in our modeling ) , we were not able to constrain any of the parameters when a relativistic line model was applied to the data .",
    "as such , it is not possible to derive any constraints on the spin of the black hole in ic  4329a using these observations .",
    "* we have made the most accurate , precise measurement of the high - energy cutoff of the x - ray emission to date : @xmath5 .",
    "this measurement improves on that made with _ nustar",
    "_ alone in paper i ( @xmath55 ) , demonstrating the necessity of obtaining high - s / n , broadband x - ray data in order to determine the properties of the corona .",
    "* using data from both _",
    "suzaku _ and _ nustar _ , we derive @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the spherical geometry , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the slab geometry .      it is important to establish the continuum level in agn in order to determine their overall energy budget , and the high - s / n , broadband x - ray spectra we have obtained using _ suzaku _ and _ nustar _ simultaneously enable us to disentangle the continuum , absorption and reflection signatures more accurately than we are able to with either observatory alone .",
    "our spectral and timing analyses of the simultaneous _ suzaku _ and _ nustar _ observations of ic  4329a demonstrate that changes in the continuum flux are responsible for the modest , secular changes in the overall source flux that we detect .",
    "the high - s / n , broadband spectra enable us to determine that neither the absorption nor reflection components show any significant variability over the course of our observing campaign .",
    "though this result was hinted at in paper i , the addition of the _ suzaku _ data to the analysis confirms the lack of absorption variability , in particular .",
    "referencing model  1 , we note that the power - law normalization decreases by @xmath53 between the high- and low - flux states during our observations (  [ sec : spec_var ] ) ; similarly , the overall source flux decreases by approximately the same amount (  [ sec : timing ] ) .",
    "the variation is more pronounced at energies below @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : high_low_diff_norefl ] ) , in keeping with our examination of the rms variability spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar ] ) .",
    "we note that the spectrum is rather hard : the cutoff power - law fit in model  1 returns a photon index of @xmath47 , also confirming the results from paper i. this is consistent with several recent measurements taken with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ ( average @xmath59 ; & yaqoob 2004 ; steenbrugge et  al . 2005 ; markowitz , reeves , & braito 2006 ) , but inconsistent with the joint _",
    "xmm+integral _ spectral fitting performed by ( 2009 ) ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the data reported by molina were not obtained simultaneously .",
    "spectral fitting returned a significantly softer index in previous epochs as well ; between 1995 and 2001 , the average reported spectral slope was @xmath61 with a range between @xmath62 ( madejski et  al .",
    "1995 ; cappi et  al .",
    "1996 ; perola et  al . 1999",
    "; done et  al .",
    "2000 ; gondoin et  al .",
    "caution should be used when measuring the power - law slope using only data @xmath63 , as the true slope of the continuum is best assessed over a much broader energy band extending out to higher energies where the continuum is more dominant .",
    "we also note that the quality of our data at high energies with _",
    "now far surpasses that of the spectra obtained with _",
    "rxte , bepposax , cgro _ or _",
    "integral_. even so , these differences in measured power - law slope may indicate that ic  4329a undergoes significant coronal variability on @xmath64years - long timescales .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the cutoff energy of the power - law shows similar variations to the spectral index , but unfortunately the constraints placed on this parameter historically are too loose to enable this test .",
    "in all of the observations prior to 2009 , either the cutoff energy was fixed to the @xmath65 result obtained by ( 1999 ) , or did not improve on this result ( e.g. , @xmath66 , 1995 ; @xmath67 , 2001 ) .",
    "our result ( @xmath68 , consistent with yet more precise than the measurement from paper i ) is consistent with that obtained by ( 2009 ) , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : broadband ] .",
    "it is also at the median point of the high - energy power - law cutoffs that have been measured in seyfert agn thus far with _",
    "nustar_. others include ark  120 ( @xmath69 , 2014 ) , swift  j2127.4 + 5654 ( @xmath70 , 2014 ) and mrk  335 ( @xmath71 , parker , submitted ) .",
    "owing to the high quality and broadband energy coverage of our data , we were able to reach beyond the phenomenological power - law representation of the continuum and consider more physical models , following our work with the _ nustar _ data alone in paper i. models  2 - 3 provide roughly equivalent statistical fits to the data , incorporating a comptt model that parametrizes the temperature , optical depth and geometry of the electron plasma , as well as an xillver model that assumes a neutral slab of material inclined at @xmath72 to our line of sight and leaves the reflected flux from the disk and its iron abundance as free parameters .",
    "we also added in two gaussian components to represent ( 1 ) a blend of the resonance , intercombination and forbidden ovii emission lines , and ( 2 ) a contribution from a broad fe k@xmath1 line from the inner disk .",
    "the goodness - of - fit is largely insensitive to the coronal geometry assumed , though the temperatures derived from the spherical and slab geometries are inconsistent at the @xmath73 level ( @xmath6 and @xmath8 , respectively ) .",
    "the two models also produce different values for the optical depth of the corona : @xmath57 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "these values differ by @xmath74 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hist ] ) even after the factor - of - two geometrical difference in calculating the optical depth is accounted for ( see paper i ) , indicating that a physical change in the properties of the plasma is necessary when applying a different geometry in order to achieve a good fit .",
    "this was not the case when models  2 - 3 were fit to the _ nustar _ data alone in paper i. unfortunately , the lack of both short timescale variability and significant relativistic , inner disk reflection in ic  4329a during our observing campaign prevents us from determining the distance of the corona from the accretion disk , and from being able to constrain how centrally concentrated the coronal emission is .",
    "though the spherical model returns a slightly better statistical fit , we conclude that the slab model is more physically believable due to the tighter match it provides between coronal temperature and power - law cutoff energy ( assuming @xmath75 ; in this case , @xmath76 , which is much closer than model  2 to being compatible with the measured power - law cutoff value in model  1 ) . we also note that the temperature and optical depth of the plasma are much more tightly constrained in the slab geometry . due to an inherent modeling degeneracy between the optical depth and temperature of the electron plasma in each geometry",
    ", however , there is a small , linearly correlated range of values for these parameters which demonstrate approximately equal statistical fit quality , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : mo2_contours]a and [ fig : mo3_contours]a .",
    "it is thus not surprising that , as the temperature increases in the slab vs. sphere case , the optical depth decreases to compensate and produce an equivalent goodness - of - fit .",
    "nonetheless , both parameters are constrained with the best precision and accuracy ever achieved .",
    "we also note that both sets of values for the coronal temperature and optical depth measured with the combined , simultaneous _",
    "suzaku _ and _ nustar _ datasets deviate significantly from those obtained when fitting the _",
    "data alone in models  2 - 3 of paper i ( figs .",
    "[ fig : mo2_contours]a , [ fig : mo3_contours]a and [ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "in particular , the slab geometry in paper i returned @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which is inconsistent with the results for this geometry using the combined dataset at a @xmath79 level .",
    "we attribute this difference to the larger spectral energy coverage of the combined dataset , which , as noted previously , allows us to definitively disentangle the signatures of the continuum , reflection and absorption in ways that _ nustar _ alone can not , since its effective area only extends down to @xmath80 and its spectral resolution in the fe k band is three times worse than that of _ suzaku _ ( @xmath81 vs. @xmath82 ) .",
    "the amount of reflection in the system and the curvature induced by the high - energy cutoff of the continuum are particularly degenerate at energies @xmath83 , but having the high - s / n , high spectral resolution _ suzaku _ data in the fe k band , especially , allows us to break this degeneracy and to independently constrain @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : mo2_contours]b and [ fig : mo3_contours]b ) .",
    "taking these factors into account , we consider the values for the coronal temperature and optical depth measured in this work to be the definitive physical properties of the corona in ic  4329a . their deviation from those determined through the analysis of only @xmath86 data at lower spectral resolution underscore the importance of obtaining high - s / n data across a broad x - ray bandpass in order to draw conclusions about the corona from comptonization models .    as more constraints on coronal parameters",
    "are measured from a sample of agn , it will be interesting to compare the coronal properties ( e.g. , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) with the those of the black hole and inner accretion flow ( e.g. , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "it has long been thought that more actively accreting black holes cool their coronae more efficiently ( , mc hardy , & maccarone 2013 and references therein ) , but a sample of agn with sensitive , broad - band x - ray spectra , as presented here for ic  4329a , would help to test this conjecture .",
    "the addition of the _ suzaku _ data enables us to perform a detailed analysis of the fe k region in ic  4329a , while the _ nustar _ data provide an important check on the physical consistency of our models by simultaneously showing us the compton reflection continuum @xmath93 .",
    "the majority of the reflection component originates in material at large distances from the black hole ( e.g. , the putative torus ) , and is well fit by a static , neutral xillver component .",
    "though there is evidence for a broad fe k@xmath1 line or a compton shoulder due to the residuals remaining after a narrow fe k@xmath1 line is included , the broad line explanation is more likely since the reflection models we employ already incorporate a compton shoulder component .",
    "that said , the compton shoulder explanation can not be conclusively ruled out with these data .",
    "assuming that the residuals do correspond to a broad iron line component , modeling this emission feature with a relativistic line profile ( e.g. , diskline , laor or relline ) yields no improvement in the fit and the model parameters can not be constrained .",
    "we have successfully modeled this residual emission with a gaussian line at @xmath94 , and can place a limit on its strength relative to the continuum of @xmath95 ( model  1 ) .",
    "only @xmath96 of the reflected emission arises from the broadened fe k@xmath1 feature .",
    "while obviously present and originating from well within the broad emission line region ( @xmath97 ) , this feature likely represents only a weak broad line from the inner disk .",
    "indeed , the reflection fraction constrained via the pexrav model in ",
    "[ sec : suzaku ] is also low by comparison with other bright , nearby seyfert 1 agn ( walton et  al .",
    "such a finding is in keeping with the theoretical work of ( 2010 ) , however , who suggested that the majority of seyferts may have broad fe k@xmath1 lines with @xmath98 .",
    "our inability to constrain any of the parameters when a relativistic disk line model is applied renders it useless in constraining the spin of the black hole , however .",
    "similarly , attempting to fit this feature with a relativistic smearing kernel convolved with an ionized disk reflection spectrum also results in no statistical improvement in fit and no parameter constraints .",
    "the feature is not apparent in the high - low flux difference spectrum of the agn , meaning that it is not significantly variable over the course of the observations .",
    "even if it does arise from inner disk reflection this is not surprising , given the lack of short timescale variability of the continuum .",
    "a broad fe k line has been reported in every observation taken of ic  4329a with an x - ray observatory capable of spectrally resolving it ( piro et  al .",
    "1990 ; madejski et  al . 1995 ; cappi et  al . 1996",

    "such a line was also noted in the _ xmm - newton _ analysis of the source by ( 2010 ) , suggesting that this line , though difficult to characterize definitively , is a persistent feature of the spectrum over years - long timescales .",
    "provided that sufficient photon counts have been obtained in the observation ( i.e. , @xmath99 from @xmath100 ) , broad fe k lines are detected in @xmath101 of all agn ( guainazzi , bianchi , & doviak 2006 ; nandra et  al .",
    "2007 ; de la calle prez et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "further , some actively accreting agn have had broad fe k emission lines reported in previous epochs but not currently ( e.g. , ngc  5548 , 2012 ) . taking these points into consideration",
    ", it is perhaps not surprising to find that ic  4329a does not exhibit strong relativistic reflection signatures during our observation . indeed , marginal detections of broad fe k emission lines such as that found here may be the norm rather than the exception among even actively accreting agn ( ballantyne 2010 ) . within this framework ,",
    "it is intriguing to note that the source is accreting at @xmath102 for a black hole with an estimated mass of @xmath23 ( de la calle prez et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "given that the keplerian velocity of the broadened fe k@xmath1 feature places its origin at @xmath103 from the black hole , this suggests that the optically thick disk may not extend down to the isco .",
    "the disk may be truncated within this radius , or perhaps it is too highly ionized to significantly contribute to the reflection spectrum .",
    "indeed , highly ionized disks are expected in relatively high accretion rate sources ( ballantyne , mcduffie , & rusin 2011 ) such as ic  4329a .",
    "the power - law photon index of the source is also considerably harder ( @xmath104 ) than is typical for an actively accreting source with an inner disk extending down to its isco , and marks a departure of @xmath105 from the agn relation measured by ( 2013 ) .",
    "according to these authors , for an eddington ratio of @xmath106 , one should measure @xmath107 , in contrast to the @xmath47 measured here for ic  4329a ( however , the intrinsic scatter in this relation must be considered , as must the uncertainty in measuring the eddington ratio in a given source ) .",
    "the relative weakness of the reflection features compared to similar agn coupled with the hard power - law index of the source , particularly , lends credence to the hypothesis put forward in paper i : that we are witnessing an outflowing corona with @xmath108 , following the work of ( 1999 ) and , beloborodov , & poutanen ( 2001 ) .",
    "although an ionized inner disk would certainly inhibit strong reflection features from this region , as per ( 2010 ) , it is worth noting that the outflowing corona scenario would suppress them as well : if the main locus of coronal emission is situated at a height of @xmath109 then we become insensitive to reflection from the disk within @xmath110 . also , if the corona is relativistically outflowing then aberration decreases the illumination of the inner disk , again making us less sensitive to any reflection from this region",
    ". under any of the above conditions we would not expect to be able to constrain the spin of the black hole in ic  4329a .",
    "a deep multi - wavelength campaign involving uv spectra , particularly , in addition to the outstanding data now available in x - rays with _ nustar _ and _ suzaku , xmm - newton _ or _ chandra _ would be necessary in order to properly evaluate the characteristics and structure of the inner accretion disk , and to place our results on the energetics of the system in their proper context ."

    "<S> we have obtained a deep , simultaneous observation of the bright , nearby seyfert galaxy ic  4329a with _ suzaku _ and _ nustar_. through a detailed spectral analysis , we are able to robustly separate the continuum , absorption and distant reflection components in the spectrum . the absorbing column is found to be modest ( @xmath0 ) , and does not introduce any significant curvature in the fe k band . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to place a strong constraint on the presence of a broadened fe k@xmath1 line ( @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , though we are not able to constrain any of the parameters of a relativistic reflection model . </S>",
    "<S> these results highlight the range in broad fe k line strengths observed in nearby , bright agn ( roughly an order of magnitude ) , and imply a corresponding range in the physical properties of the inner accretion disk in these sources . </S>",
    "<S> we have also updated our previously reported measurement of the high - energy cutoff of the hard x - ray emission using both observatories rather than just _ nustar _ </S>",
    "<S> alone : @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this high - energy cutoff acts as a proxy for the temperature of the coronal electron plasma , enabling us to further separate this parameter from the plasma s optical depth and to update our results for these parameters as well . </S>",
    "<S> we derive @xmath6 with @xmath7 using a spherical geometry , @xmath8 with @xmath9 for a slab geometry , with both having an equivalent goodness - of - fit . </S>"
