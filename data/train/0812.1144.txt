    "one of the remaining problems in low energy qcd is the quantitative field theoretical description of the confinement - deconfinement phase transition .",
    "apart from its genuine importance for a first principle understanding of the confining physics in qcd it also is a key input for the evaluation of the qcd phase diagram .    in the past decade",
    "much progress has been achieved both in continuum studies as well as with lattice computations for our understanding of the low energy sector of qcd , for reviews see e.g.@xcite . for an analytical description of the low energy sector ,",
    "topological degrees of freedom are likely to play an important role for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition as well as for chiral symmetry breaking , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been very successfully described within instanton models , whereas the confining properties of the theory are harder to incorporate within semi - classical descriptions .",
    "indeed , tracking down those topological degrees of freedoms relevant for confinement in the physical vacuum has its intricacies as the physical vacuum is more likely to contain a rather dense packing of topological configurations , making their detection difficult .",
    "moreover , models of confinement are rather based on topological defects instead of stable topological objects , the construction of which out of these defects is plagued by non - localities .",
    "still , these defects are manifest in the polyakov loop , the order parameter in pure yang - mills theory @xcite , and can be extracted by an appropriate gauge fixing , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "gauge fixing is also mandatory in most continuum formulations of qcd for removing the redundant gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "this is mostly seen as a liability of such an approach , as a formulation of qcd in gauge - variant variables complicates the access to gauge invariant observables .",
    "however , gauge fixing is nothing but a reparameterisation of the path integral and can be used for even facilitating the computation of at least a subset of observables .",
    "indeed , this point of view has been exploited much in the discussion of confinement mechanisms based on topological defects .",
    "more recently it also has become clear that these are not competing physics mechanisms but rather different facets of the same global physics picture which still awaits a fully gauge invariant description , see e.g.@xcite . despite this final step",
    "we have learned much from the combined investigations which together built a nearly complete mosaic .",
    "the effective potential of the polyakov loop has also been used as an input for effective field theories that give some access to the qcd phase diagram @xcite . at finite temperature and vanishing density ,",
    "these models have led to impressive results in particular for thermodynamical quantities . at finite chemical potential ,",
    "the back - reaction of the matter sector to the gauge sector is difficult to quantify in these models , and the chiral and confinement - deconfinement phase transitions are sensitive to the details of this back - reaction .",
    "this also holds true for the question of a quarkyonic phase with confinement and chiral symmetry at finite density @xcite . for an extension of these models",
    "one has to resort to a field - theoretical description of the gauge sector which allows to systematically study the impact of a finite chemical potential on the dynamics of the gauge field , @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the evaluation of green functions of the polyakov loop allows for a direct access to the physics in the strongly coupled sector of qcd , and in particular the confinement - deconfinement phase transition . in the present work",
    "we initiate a non - perturbative study of qcd in polyakov gauge . in this gauge",
    "the polyakov loop takes a particularly simple form and is directly related to the temporal component of the gauge field . after integrating - out the spatial components of the gauge field , and formulated with polyakov loop variables , the gauge field sector of qcd resembles a scalar model .",
    "the dynamics of low energy yang - mills theory is then incorporated by evaluating wilsonian flows for the effective action @xcite .",
    "we derive the flow equation for qcd in polyakov gauge , and solve it for the full effective potential of the polyakov loop . due to the formulation in polyakov gauge a simple truncation already suffices to encode the physics of the confinement - deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the results include the temperature dependence of the polyakov loop , and the critical temperature .",
    "we also compare the present approach to lattice studies @xcite , and to a recent continuum computation in landau gauge @xcite .",
    "in qcd with static quarks the expectation value of a static quark @xmath2 serves as an order parameter for confinement . it is proportional to the free energy @xmath3 of such a state , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the inverse temperature .",
    "hence in the confining phase at low temperature , the expectation value vanishes , whereas at high temperatures in the deconfined phase , it is non - zero .",
    "the polyakov loop variable , @xcite , is the creation operator for a static quark , @xmath6 where the trace in is done in the fundamental representation , and the polyakov loop operator is a wegner - wilson loop in time direction , @xmath7 here @xmath8 stands for path ordering .",
    "we conclude that @xmath9 , and thus the negative logarithm of the polyakov loop expectation value relates to the free energy of a static fundamental color source .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 measures whether center symmetry is realised by the ensemble under consideration , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "more specifically we consider gauge transformations @xmath11 with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a center element . in @xmath0",
    "the center is @xmath14 , whereas in physical qcd with @xmath15 it is @xmath16 . under such center transformations",
    "the polyakov loop operator @xmath17 in is multiplied with a center element @xmath13 , @xmath18 and so does the polyakov loop , @xmath19 .",
    "hence , a center - symmetric confining ( disordered ) ground state ensures @xmath20 , whereas deconfinement @xmath21 signals the ordered phase and center - symmetry breaking , @xmath22 the expectation value of the polyakov loop can be deduced from the equations of motion of its effective potential @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "we shall argue , that the computation of the latter greatly simplifies within an appropriate choice of gauge . indeed , gauge fixing is nothing but the choice of a specific parameterisation of the path integral , and a conveniently chosen parameterisation can simplify the task of computing physical observables .    in the present case",
    "our choice of gauge is guided by the demand of a particularly simple representation of the polyakov loop variable .",
    "a gauge ensuring time - independent @xmath24 leads to both , a trivial integration in and renders the path ordering irrelevant .",
    "having done this one can still rotate the polyakov loop operator @xmath17 , , into the cartan subgroup .",
    "the above properties are achieved for time - independent gauge field configurations in the cartan subalgebra , i.e.  @xmath25 . for @xmath0",
    "this reads @xmath26 and entails a particularly simple relation between @xmath24 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 note that this simple relation is not valid on the level of expectation values of @xmath27 and @xmath24 , in @xmath0 we have @xmath29 .",
    "however , in the present work we consider an approach that gives direct access to the effective potential @xmath30 $ ] for the gauge field , as distinguished to those for the polyakov loop , @xmath31 $ ] .    here , we argue that @xmath32 $ ] also serves as an order parameter : to that end we show that the order parameter @xmath33\\rangle $ ] is bounded from above by @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath32 $ ] is non - vanishing in the center - broken phase .",
    "furthermore we show that in the center - symmetric phase with vanishing order parameter , @xmath34 \\rangle=0 $ ] , also the observable @xmath35 $ ] vanishes . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict the explicit argument to @xmath0 , but it straightforwardly extends to general @xmath36 .",
    "first we note that we can use for expressing the expectation value of @xmath24 in terms of @xmath27 , @xmath37 we emphasise that the rhs of defines an observable as it is the expectation value of an gauge invariant object .",
    "this observable happens to agree with @xmath38 in polyakov gauge .",
    "it follows from the jensen inequality that the expectation value of the polyakov loop , the order parameter for confinement , is bounded from above by @xmath35 $ ] , see @xcite @xmath39\\geq \\langle l[a_0]\\rangle\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for gauge fields @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "note that it is sufficient to consider the above interval due to periodicity and center symmetry of the potential .",
    "this means we restrict the polyakov loop expectation value to @xmath41 .",
    "negative values for @xmath10 are then obtained by center transformations , @xmath42 .",
    "is easily proven for @xmath0 from as @xmath43 is concave for @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "thus , for @xmath45 it necessarily also follows that @xmath46 .    in turn we can show that @xmath47 , if the polyakov loop variable @xmath48\\rangle$ ] vanishes .",
    "this then entails that @xmath35=0 $ ] . to that end",
    "we expand @xmath27 about its mean value @xmath49 , that is @xmath50 . inserting this expansion into we arrive at @xmath51 in the center - symmetric phase @xmath52 , c.f . .",
    "under center transformations @xmath27 transforms according to ( [ eq : centertrafo ] ) @xmath53 with @xmath54 and hence @xmath55 .",
    "it follows that @xmath56 , and all odd powers in vanish .",
    "the even powers vanish since @xmath57 is an odd function and hence has vanishing even taylor coefficients @xmath58 .",

    "thus , we only have to compute the effective potential @xmath62 $ ] in order to extract the critical temperature , and e.g.  critical exponents .",
    "this potential is more easily accessed than that for the polyakov loop .",
    "it is here were the specific gauge comes to our aid as it allows the direct physical interpretation of a component of the gauge field . this property has been already exploited in the literature , where it has been shown that @xmath63 in polyakov gauge is sensitive to topological defects related to the confinement mechanism @xcite .",
    "we proceed by discussing the generating functional of polyakov gauge yang - mills theory . for its derivation",
    "we use the faddeev - popov method . specifying to @xmath0 , the polyakov gauge is implemented by the gauge fixing conditions @xmath64 where the @xmath65 are the pauli matrices . however , the gauge fixing is not complete .",
    "it is unchanged under time - independent gauge transformations in the cartan sub - group .",
    "these remaining gauge degrees of freedom are completely fixed by the following conditions , @xmath66 the gauge fixings are integral conditions and are the weaker the more integrals are involved .",
    "basically they eliminate the corresponding zero modes .",
    "this can be seen directly upon putting the theory into a box with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath67 , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "the gauge fixing conditions , lead to the faddeev - popov determinant @xmath68 = ( 2 t)^2 \\left [ \\prod_{x } \\sin^2 \\left ( \\frac{g a_0 ^ 3        ( \\vec x ) } { 2 t } \\right ) \\right]\\ , ,   \\label{eq : fpdet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the computation of which is detailed in appendix  [ app : fpdet ] .",
