    "the approximate recursion formula is an integral equation with one variable which can be handled by standard numerical methods .",
    "the main sources of errors are the finite number of points of integration and the parametrization of the behavior of the tails of the functions integrated .",
    "the errors can be reduced by reducing the size of the tails and increasing the number of points .",

    "however , using the fourier transform of the recursion formula , we found a natural approximate method with a fast implementation and a control of the systematic errors which is better than exponential .",
    "this method is the main calculational tool used and discussed in the present article .",
    "the approximate recursion formula is closely related to the recursion formula appearing in dyson s hierarchical model@xcite .",

    "the general procedure@xcite which relates small values of @xmath11 to large values of the uv cut - off is well - known and will not be repeated here . from a calculational point of view , the discussion would be essentially the same if instead we had fixed @xmath12 and considered initial measures depending on a cut - off and several bare parameters .",
    "the rest of the presentation is based on the following empirical fact : the systematic errors due to finite volume fall exponentially with the number of iterations ( @xmath13 and the systematic errors due to finite dimensional truncation fall faster than exponentially with the dimension of the truncated space ( @xmath14 ) . in calculations involving double precision",
    ", one can , without encountering major difficulties , choose @xmath13 and @xmath14 in such a way that if we increase these parameters further , no change is observed in the results .",
    "one can then first determine the critical temperature and the numerical errors .",
    "we need to discuss these first , because the numerical errors are a fundamental limitation whenever the precision of the arithmetic operations is fixed , and there is no point in trying to reduce the systematic errors much below the numerical errors .",
    "the phase structure of the approximated models is discussed in section [ sec : phase ] .",
    "we show that , for understandable reasons , there is nothing that can be identified as a low - temperature phase . we also give a practical method to identify the inverse of the critical temperature , denoted @xmath15 , with an optimal accuracy . in the following sections",
    ", it will always be assumed that we work in the symmetric phase ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the numerical errors on the magnetic susceptibility are studied in section [ sec : num ] , where we show that the relative errors obey the approximate law @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the precision used to perform the arithmetical operations .",
    "we also show that this law follows from an approximate renormalization group calculation . as a by - product we obtain a numerical estimate of the critical exponent @xmath19 in good agreement with the existing estimates@xcite for @xmath4 . as a general remark , we have a much better quantitative control on the details of renormalization group arguments in @xmath4 than in @xmath6 , where confluent logarithmic singularities make the analysis more delicate .",
    "we then discuss the systematic errors .",
    "the volume dependence of the magnetic susceptibility is discussed in section [ sec : vol ] .",
    "we show that in order to calculate the susceptibility at an inverse temperature @xmath20 , in @xmath21 dimensions , and with relative errors @xmath22 , one needs a number of lattice sites which is of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "we then show that when the fourier transform of the recursion formula of dyson s hierarchical model is projected into a finite dimensional space of dimension @xmath14 , the relative errors on the susceptibility associated with this truncation decrease faster than @xmath24 for some positive number @xmath25 .",
    "we show in section [ sec : ht ] that similar results apply to the high - temperature expansion of the susceptibility , justifying the procedure used in ref.@xcite .    at this point",
    ", we have only discussed the susceptibility , or in other words , the 2-point function . the 4-point function is also provided by the calculational method at no extra cost . however",
    ", the calculation of the corresponding renormalized coupling constant requires a subtraction . in the discussion of the errors on the susceptibility ,",
    "we have explained that while we are iterating the recursion formula we lose significant digits `` from the right '' . with the subtraction",

    "this is explained in section [ sec : lam ] , where we calculate a `` dimensionless coupling constant '' inspired by the field theory definition of ref .",

    "@xmath4 , we show that when @xmath3 , @xmath26 tends to a fixed non - zero value that we were able to calculate with 6 significant digits .",
    "this is very convincing evidence that hyperscaling holds for the model considered here .",
    "for the nearest - neighbor ising model on a 3-dimensional cubic lattice , it is very hard to decide if hyperscaling holds on the basis of monte - carlo simulations@xcite or high - temperature expansion@xcite . in the present case",
    ", it is a short and straightforward calculation .",
    "this shows that it would be worth trying to interpolate perturbatively between dyson s model and nearest neighbor models , transforming the qualitative approximation@xcite into a quantitative approximation .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath26 decreases when @xmath21 increases .",
    "however , we were able to obtain good evidence that in @xmath6 , @xmath26 decrease like @xmath5 , in good agreement with the behavior obtained with the field theory method@xcite at lowest order in perturbation theory .",
    "our results show that it is possible to calculate accurately , and without major effort , the renormalized quantities which can be extracted from the 2- and 4-point functions .",
    "these calculations can be done for an extended range of small values of @xmath27 . in other words , for existing computers , requirement b ) is fulfilled by the hierarchical approximation provided that one does not require too - small values of @xmath28 .",
    "numerical solvability can sometimes completely change our point of view regarding a problem .",
    "taking the example of differential equations , at a time when their numerical solutions were not achievable , one could dream of a perfectly deterministic approach to natural phenomena in which everything could be known once the rules of evolution and the initial conditions were given .",
    "this paper provides a calculational method to anyone who would like to check an approximation method with accurate numerical results .",
    "as explained above , most of the approximation schemes which apply to a scalar field theory with nearest neighbor interactions on a cubic lattice also apply to dyson s model .",
    "we are presently testing the validity of several well - known but not easy - to - control expansions : the renormalized perturbative expansion , the loop expansion , and the large-@xmath10 expansion .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe dyson s hierarchical model and the methods used to calculate the average of arbitrary powers of the zero momentum component of the scalar field .",
    "the models considered here have @xmath29 sites .",
    "we label the sites with @xmath13 indices @xmath30 , each index being 0 or 1 . in order to visualize the meaning of this notation",
    ", one can divide the @xmath29 sites into two blocks , each containing @xmath31 sites .",
    "if @xmath32 , the site is in the first block , if @xmath33 , the site is in the second block . repeating this procedure @xmath13 times ( for the two blocks , their respective two sub - blocks , etc . ) , we obtain an unambiguous labeling for each of the sites .",
    "two sites differing only by @xmath34 are in the same block of size 2 .",
    "we write the action as @xmath35 the index @xmath36 , referred to as the `` level of interaction '' hereafter , corresponds to interactions of the total field in blocks of size @xmath37 .",
    "the free parameter @xmath38 , controlling the strength of the interactions , is set equal to @xmath39 in order to approximate a nearest neighbor model in @xmath21-dimensions . in this article",
    ", we will consider the cases @xmath40 3 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "the field @xmath41 is integrated with a local measure @xmath42 which needs to be specified . in the following ,",
    "we use an ising measure , @xmath43 , which takes only the values @xmath44 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the results presented do not depend on this specific choice and would also apply , for instance to the case of landau - ginzburg measures of the form @xmath45 .",
    "the integrations can be performed iteratively using the recursion formula @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a normalization factor which can be fixed at our convenience .",
    "the relation between this recursion formula and wilson s approximate recursion formula@xcite is discussed in ref .",

    "( [ eq : rec ] ) to calculate the high - temperature expansion of the magnetic susceptibility of dyson s hierarchical model up to order 800 with an ising or a landau - ginzburg measure .",
    "the calculation of the large - order coefficients requires a lot of computing time .",
    "we found that using a truncation in the expansion in @xmath67 at order 50 could cut the computer time by a factor of order 100 while having effects on the values of the coefficients which were smaller than the errors due to numerical round - off .",
    "we consider the finite dimensional approximations of degree @xmath14 : @xmath68 after each iteration , non - zero coefficients of higher order ( @xmath69 etc . )",

    "more explicitly , the recursion formula for the @xmath70 reads : @xmath71",
    "from a field theoretic point of view , an important feature of the hierarchical model is its second order phase transition .",
    "our first task will be to identify @xmath15 for the well - studied@xcite case of an ising measure .",
    "the truncation described above can be used to calculate@xcite _ exactly _ the high - temperature expansion of the magnetic susceptibility up to order @xmath72 , and one can think about the truncation as a partially re - summed high - temperature expansion .",
    "it seems thus unlikely that when @xmath14 becomes large , we would obtain sensible results when @xmath73 .",

    ", there is a sudden change of behavior .",
    "however , there is nothing that we can identify with a low - temperature phase@xcite . in all the cases that we have considered ,",
    "the change is signaled by the fact that when @xmath36 increases , the ratio @xmath76 becomes larger than 1 , and then starts making unpredictable changes , _ never _ returning to any kind of behavior like eq .",

    "proceeding similarly , we can determine the numerical value of @xmath15 with as many significant digits as the computational method allows .",
    "double precision fortran calculations made with @xmath14 = 80 are reported below for the ising model in 3 , 4 , and 5 dimensions .",

    "we have used methods which perform the arithmetic operations differently ( these methods are explained in detail in the next section ) and found the very same values of @xmath15 . in conclusion , we have found a reasonably robust value of @xmath15 which is consistent with existing results .",

    "next we will study the various sources of error occurring when one approaches @xmath87 from below .",
    "round - off errors can play an important role when recursive methods are used , because they may grow faster than the improvement of the results due to the repeated use of the method .",
    "for this reason , we have studied them with three independent methods . by independent ,",
    "we mean that the arithmetic is performed in a completely uncorrelated fashion .",
    "we have compared our original fortran calculation on a dec - alpha with three other calculations .",
    "the first one was the same program run on a mips .",
    "the second one was a mathematica program where a higher precision in the arithmetic operations was set .",
    "the precision was adjusted in such a way that the susceptibility was obtained correctly with 16 significant digits .",
    "thirdly , we have compared the calculation with the one obtained with a slightly different rescaling , namely @xmath88 , a method already used in ref .",

    "the figure shows clearly that the three types of discrepancies are essentially the same .",
    "since the three types of errors are uncorrelated , we can identify them with the round - off errors and calculate them with the most convenient method . using the third method , we have calculated the round - off errors for various values of @xmath20 .",
    "in all the cases , the logarithm of the relative error grows linearly at the beginning and then stabilizes at a constant value .",
    "the period of linear growth corresponds roughly to the iterations where @xmath91 . for larger @xmath36 ,",
    "the value of the susceptibility stabilizes , with changes decreasing by a factor @xmath92 at each step . during this second stage ,",

    "one expects the numerical error on @xmath96 to be of the order @xmath97 . with the rescaling used in this paper ,",
    "this means that the errors on the susceptibility are of the order @xmath98 now for @xmath36 such that @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 . plugging this into the previous equation , we get @xmath17 which is the empirical result found above .    for @xmath4 , one can check the details of the above argument and , as a by - product , obtain an estimate of @xmath95 .",

    "[ 3err ] is approximately 0.154 , with an estimated error of order 0.001 .",

    ", the same procedure gives an exponent which is too high by about 3 percent ( compared to the trivial value ) .",
    "this is a typical error when one does not take into account the marginal direction and the ( related ) confluent logarithmic singularity in the susceptibility .",
    "in the two previous sections , we developed a qualitative understanding regarding the finite volume susceptibility @xmath105 , or in other words regarding the way the susceptibility depends on the number of iterations .",
    "volume effects can be important in the determination of the critical exponents .",

    "[ slope3 ] and [ slope4 ] we have used every tenth coefficient in the range from @xmath142 . from these fits ,",
    "we find for @xmath4 : @xmath143 for @xmath6 we found @xmath144 and for @xmath136 : @xmath145    in @xmath4 , for example , these results show us that we need @xmath120 larger than 34 for the error on @xmath146 to be less than @xmath94 , while for @xmath6 , @xmath147 . therefore , the value of @xmath148 we have previously used in calculating the first 800 coefficients is more than adequate .",
    "in this section , we discuss the numerical aspects of the calculation of subtracted quantities .",
    "we specialize the discussion to the calculation of the `` dimensionless renormalized coupling constant''@xcite corresponding to the 4-point function .    from eq.([eq : moments ] ) , it is clear that the calculation of @xmath149 allows us to determine the renormalized coupling constants .",
    "the first step in the calculation of these quantities is to extract the connected parts . in other words ,",
    "we first subtract the disconnected parts from the @xmath150-point function . from a numerical point of view , this is not a trivial operation , because the subtracted quantities ( connected parts ) scale differently with the volume than the parts of which they are made .",
    "for instance , for @xmath116 and @xmath36 sufficiently large , @xmath151 while the individual components scale like @xmath152 .",
    "the situation is worse if we consider the 6-point functions , where the connected part has the same scaling as eq .",
    "( [ eq : conn ] ) but the individual components scale like @xmath153 . in other words ,",
    "the beginning significant numbers of the individual terms do not matter for the subtracted quantities .",
    "assuming 16 significant digits , when @xmath152 reaches @xmath154 , we still get the subtracted parts with 8 significant digits . when @xmath37 reaches @xmath154 , there are no significant digits left for the subtracted part .    as a consequence ,",
    "it is not always possible to stabilize the value of the connected part during as many iterations as we would like , given the study of section [ sec : vol ] .",
    "this is an interesting situation .",
    "as long as we increase the number of iterations , we get a value of the unsubtracted quantity which becomes closer to its infinite volume limit .",
    "if we represent the significant digits of a double precision number as a sequence of 16 digits written in the conventional way , we can visualize this procedure as the successive obtention of the digits on the right side of the number .",
    "unfortunately , at the same time , the part which gets subtracted increases in magnitude .",
    "consequently , more an more digits on the left side of the number are wasted for the evaluation of the subtracted quantities .",
    "the situation gets worse if we consider the 6 or higher point functions .",
    "the subtracted quantities are diverging near criticality .",
    "however , it is possible to define@xcite dimensionless renormalized coupling constants which have a finite limit . in the case of the four point function , the dimensionless renormalized coupling constant @xmath155",
    "is obtained by multiplying the zero - momentum connected green s function @xmath156 by the @xmath157 power of the renormalized mass @xmath158 , namely @xmath159 the mnemonic for @xmath157 is 8 ( amputation of the 4 legs at zero - momentum ) + @xmath160 ( the canonical dimension of the @xmath161 bare coupling constant ) .",
    "we are using the notation @xmath162    in order to compare with field theory results , one should consider landau - ginzburg measures where the cut - off dependence has been restored explicitly . for instance , in @xmath4 , the definition of the functions entering in the callan - symanzik equations ( the beta function etc . ) given in ref.@xcite requires that we keep the _",
    "dimensionful _ constant fixed while the cut - off goes to infinity . in other words , we need to change the _ dimensionless _ constant entering in @xmath163 while taking the infinite cut - off limit .",
    "this delicate procedure is beyond the scope of this paper , where we emphasize the basic numerical aspect of a single calculation . as explained in the introduction , we continue using a fixed ising measure and a single adjustable parameter ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 has a finite ( and supposedly non - zero when @xmath164 ) limit when @xmath165 or equivalently when @xmath3 .",
    "we can thus bypass the explicit introduction of the cut - off .",
    "taking into account that there is no wave function renormalization , or in other words that the critical exponent @xmath166 is zero , we define @xmath26 as the limit where @xmath36 goes to @xmath167 of @xmath168    equivalently , with the convention of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rn ] ) , which does not involve inverse factorials , and for the value @xmath62 always used here , we obtain @xmath169    in practice , we pick a given relative precision @xmath170 and we require that @xmath36 is large enough to stabilize the susceptibility _ and _ @xmath26 with a relative precision @xmath171 .",
    "the reason for requiring both conditions is that @xmath26 may temporarily stabilize when the flow passes near the fixed point ( and so we are still far away from the infinite volume limit ) , but this is signaled by the fact that the susceptibility is still growing . in summary , we require @xmath172 and @xmath173 when these two conditions are satisfied , we check that our result for @xmath26 is compatible with the expected precision , or in other words , that we have enough significant digits left in @xmath174 to calculate @xmath26 with a relative precision @xmath170 .",
    "we thus require the additional condition @xmath175 where @xmath171 is a typical round - off error ( @xmath94 in double precision ) .",
    "if the additional condition is not satisfied , we lower @xmath171 and repeat the calculation .",
    "we have applied this algorithm in @xmath4 , 4 , and 5 and for @xmath176 .    for @xmath4 , we were able to do all the calculations with @xmath177 .",
    "we found that @xmath26 reaches a limit @xmath178 when @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , hyperscaling holds very well .",
    "[ ren3 ] shows that to a good approximation @xmath179    in @xmath6 , we had to reduce to @xmath180 .",
    "we found that @xmath26 tends to zero when @xmath3 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ ren4 ] , we have the approximate law @xmath181 which is consistent with perturbative calculations@xcite .    in @xmath136 , we had to reduce further to @xmath182 .",
    "we found that @xmath26 tends to zero according to the approximate law @xmath183 as shown in fig .",
    "if we replace @xmath184 by @xmath185 , we see that our result is consistent with @xmath186 .",
    "we have shown that the use of truncations in the fourier transform of the recursion relation of dyson s hierarchical model leads to systematic errors which can be suppressed more than exponentially when the dimension of the truncated space increases .",
    "we have justified the use of the truncation for calculations@xcite of the high - temperature expansion .",
    "we have shown that the finite volume effects can be reduced with an exponential precision .",
    "we have found the temperature dependence of the numerical errors and explained the empirical results with a simple renormalization group argument .",
    "the numerical errors appear as a practical aspect of the hierarchy problem .",
    "if it seems hard to believe that nature would fine - tune its fundamental parameters to produce scalar particles with masses very small compared to the planck scale , there are also practical difficulties related to this fine - tuning . in the present context , it is quite simple to find @xmath187 .",
    "however , this is not the end of the story : the physical quantities become numerically unstable when we reach @xmath15 .",
    "this difficulty is not unsurmountable if we want to reach a cut - off of the order of the planck scale which is _ only _ 17 orders of magnitude larger than the weak scale .",
    "we can use programming methods with enough significant digits . to take the analogy with differential equations , the problem of sensitive dependence on initial conditions can be dealt with provided that we do not evolve the system during a too - long amount of time .",
    "the methods presented here can be applied to field theoretical calculations .",
    "the simplest one is the calculation of the renormalized mass .",
    "this quantity is crucial because it enters into the definition of the functions appearing in the callan - symanzik equations@xcite . for the model considered here ,",
    "a possible definition of the renormalized mass is @xmath188 where @xmath95 is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized renormalization group transformation which needs to be calculated precisely .",
    "@xmath189 is a uv cut - off taking the value @xmath190 where @xmath191 is a scale of reference below which we are considering an effective theory .",
    "finally , @xmath192 is a parameter which allows us to change the value of the renormalized mass . as explained in section [ sec : lam ] , the method can also be applied to the calculation of renormalized quantities in landau - ginzburg models .",
    "these calculations will be used to check the validity of the perturbative evaluations of the functions entering the callan - symanzik equations . in the case",
