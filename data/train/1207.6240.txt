    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite is one of the most remarkable examples of strongly correlated electron system . since its discovery it has been subject on an intense study both from the theoretical and the experimental point of view , with the aim of providing an unified picture of the plethora of different observed values of filling factor @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite a suitable theoretical framework for the description of these states is provided by the theory of edge states @xcite . for the laughlin series @xcite at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) a chiral luttinger liquid theory described in terms of a single bosonic mode was proposed .",
    "@xcite for the more general jain series @xcite with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) a possible extension has been proposed by x. g. wen @xcite considering @xmath6 additional hierarchical fields , propagating with finite velocity along the edge .",
    "noise experiments in the quantum point contact ( qpc ) geometry @xcite have been crucial to demonstrate the existence of the peculiar fractionally charged excitations predicted by the theoretical models .",
    "@xcite in particular it was proved that , for the jain sequence , the elementary quasiparticle ( qp ) charge is given by @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite more recently some intriguing transport experiments have been performed on a qpc at very low temperature and extremely weak backscattering for various filling factors showing a change in the power - law of the backscattering current as a function of temperature and an enhancing of the effective tunneling charge , as extracted from the noise . @xcite in order to explain both these unexpected behaviors we observed that propagating neutral modes could crucially modify the scaling dimensions of operators leading to a crossover in the relevance of the tunneling process according to measurements.@xcite    the symmetrized noise at finite frequency @xcite represents an important tool to characterize the predicted crossover phenomenology , complementary and alternative to current and zero frequency noise . from the experimental point of view , measurements of colored noise have been carried out for a qpc in a 2d electron gas at zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , great efforts are devoted to extend the observations to more interesting cases including the fqh regime . from a theoretical point of view , the colored noise was investigated for the laughlin sequence @xcite and also for more exotic states like @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite in these cases , much of the relevant physics occurs at frequencies close to josephson frequencies multiple of @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 the charge of the elementary excitation ) that is in the range of ghz for external bias @xmath11 in the range of @xmath12v .",
    "these values , although high , should be experimentally observable .    in this paper we will discriminate among the different tunneling charges involved in the transport , being their contributions resolved at different frequencies .",
    "we will focus on the edge state at @xmath0 where only two bosonic fields , one charged and one neutral , are involved .",
    "@xcite we will demonstrate the necessity to consider voltages larger than the neutral modes cut - off frequency , in order to efficiently detect the presence of the 2-agglomerate .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wen_jain ] we recall the wen s model for the description of the fqh state at @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ transport ] we provide the expression for the backscattering current and noise in terms of the tunneling rates . in sec .",
    "[ scaling_sec ] we analyze the scaling behaviors for various energy regimes . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present the finite frequency noise peak structure for @xmath0 as a function of the bias voltage in order to determine the optimal values of the physical parameters to observe the @xmath13-agglomerate peak . sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we consider infinite edge states of an hall bar in the jain sequence at filling factor @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite we focus on the case @xmath0 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , described by the lagrangian density @xcite ( @xmath16 ) = _ x^c ( _ t - v_c_x)^c+ _ x^n(_t - v_n _ x)^n , [ action ] with @xmath17 the propagation velocity of the charged bosonic mode @xmath18 and @xmath19 the one of the neutral bosonic mode @xmath20 .",
    "the electron number density of the edge depends on the charged field only , via the relation @xmath21 . due to this fact",
    "the charge mode velocity is affected by coulomb interactions , leading to the reasonable assumption @xmath22.@xcite from ( [ action ] ) one can note that the neutral mode co - propagates with respect to the charged one as typical of the states with @xmath23 . @xcite the commutators of the bosonic fields are @xmath24=i\\pi \\nu_{\\rm{c / n } }   \\mathrm{sgn}(x - y)$ ] with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we consider a generic @xmath27-agglomerate annihilation operator with charge @xmath28 with @xmath29 the charge of the elementary excitation , namely the single - quasiparticle ( qp ) ( @xmath30 the electron charge ) .",
    "it can be written as [ op_wen_5 ] ^(m , j ) ( x , t ) = e^i ( ^ ( x , t ) + ^ ( x , t ) ) where @xmath31 is a finite length cut - off , @xmath32 is related to the charge of the excitation and the additional quantum number @xmath33 plays a role analogous to the isospin and is necessary in order to provide the proper fractional statistics .",
    "@xcite note that for a given quasiparticle excitation the integer @xmath27 and @xmath34 must have the same parity .",
    "the klein factors @xmath35 are ladder operators necessary in order to change the particle numbers of the @xmath27-agglomerate and to provide the proper statistical properties between excitations .",
    "@xcite from the long time limit of the two - point imaginary time green s function @xmath36 calculated at @xmath37 and at zero temperature @xcite , one can extract the scaling dimension of the @xmath27-agglomerate    ^(m , j)= . [ scaling ]    for energies higher than the typical neutral mode bandwidth",
    "@xmath38 the neutral mode contribution to the dynamics saturates and one has the effective scaling dimension @xcite ^(m , j)= _ ( ) ^2 [ scaling_eff ] that only depends on the charged sector of the theory . from now on the correspondent charged mode bandwidth @xmath39 is assumed as the greatest energy scale of the system .",
    "note that the above scaling dimension could be strongly affected by interaction with the external environment @xcite , nevertheless in this paper , for sake of simplicity , we only consider the standard unrenormalized case .",
    "the tunneling through the qpc at @xmath37 of a generic @xmath27-agglomerate between the @xmath40 and @xmath41 edges of the hall bar , is described by the hamiltonian @xmath42 , where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the @xmath27-agglomerate annihilation operator . from equation ( [ scaling ] )",
    "it is easy to note that the more relevant single - qps ( @xmath45 ) are the ones with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , while among all the @xmath13-agglomerate ( @xmath48 ) we consider the one with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "all the other operators with the same charge ( same @xmath27 ) and different @xmath34 are less relevant in the renormalization group sense and give a negligible contribution to the transport properties with respect to the considered one .",
    "@xcite from now on , for notational convenience , we will omit the index @xmath34 where not necessary .",
    "the tunneling amplitudes @xmath51 depend , in general , on the geometry of the constriction , and can be energy dependent .",
    "@xcite in the following they will be assumed as @xmath27-dependent constants in order to make the discussion clearer and to restrict the number of free parameters of the theory .",
    "the total tunneling hamiltonian will consist of the sum over all possible @xmath27-agglomerate @xmath52 .",
    "in the following we will focus on the weak tunneling regime . at lowest order in the tunneling hamiltonian the backscattering current of the @xmath27-agglomerate @xmath53 and the finite frequency",
    "symmetrized noise @xmath54 can be written in terms of the tunneling rates @xcite . by using the detailed balance relation",
    "the current is @xcite ( @xmath55 ) i^(m)_b(_0)=m e^*(1-e^-m_0/t)^(m ) ( _ 0 ) , [ current_bal ] with tunneling rate ^(m)(e)=|**t**_m|^2 ^+_- dt e^im et g^<_m , r(0,-t ) g^>_m , l(0,t ) .",

    "[ noise_freq_curr ] the above result is consistent with the non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "@xcite note that from ( [ noise_freq_rate ] ) one can easily restore the well known result for the zero frequency limit .",
    "@xcite    at lowest perturbative order the total noise will be s_b()=_ms^(m)_b ( ) , [ totalnoise ] being the contributions of the different @xmath27-agglomerate independent .",
    "note that , analogously , the total backscattering current is given by @xmath60 .",
    "the simple relations in ( [ noise_freq_curr ] ) - ( [ totalnoise ] ) are due to the poissonian statistics of the tunneling processes at lowest order in @xmath61 and to the independency of the sources of noise .",
    "let us now focus on the evaluation of the tunneling rate in ( [ tunn_rate ] ) , starting from the zero temperature limit . here ,",
    "the bosonic green s functions are @xcite ^s(0,t ) ^s(0,0 ) & = -_s , [ gfbosonic ]    with @xmath62 , leading to the tunneling rate @xcite ^(m)(e ) & & = ( ) ^ ( ) ^ e^- + & & _ 1 f_1 ( m e ) .",
    "[ risoluzione_due_modi ] here,@xmath63 $ ] is the kummer confluent hypergeometric function @xcite , @xmath64 and @xmath65 the charged and the neutral exponent respectively .",
    "the rate shows two different regimes . at low energies ( @xmath66 ) the rate scales as ^(m)(e ) e^4 ^(m , j)-1 receiving contributions from both the charged and the neutral modes . in the same limit , for frequencies close to the josephson resonance @xmath67 , one has ( cf .",

    "[ noisejoseph ]    as stated before , for the single - qp the scaling dimension is given by @xmath68 , while for the next excitation , the @xmath13-agglomerate , the scaling are driven by the charged mode contribution only in such a way that @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) ) .",
    "these behaviors indicate the @xmath13-agglomerate as the dominant excitation in the current.@xcite all other excitations , with higher charges and different isospin , have higher scaling dimensions and can be safely neglected .",
    "note that the peculiar values of the scaling dimensions imply a divergent power - law behavior of the total noise in correspondence of the @xmath13-agglomerate josephson frequencies ( @xmath69 ) and a dip for the single - qp ( @xmath70 ) .    for applied voltages higher than the neutral mode cut - off ( @xmath71 ) the neutral modes saturate leading to a lower effective dimension @xmath72 for the single - qp ( cf .",
    "( [ scaling_eff ] ) ) . on the other hands ,",
    "the 2-agglomerate scaling is unaffected . in this case one",
    "has a two peak structure in correspondence of the josephson frequencies of the two excitations ( @xmath70 and @xmath69 respectively ) .",
    "at finite temperature the above behaviors will be smoothened with more remarkable changes near to the josephson resonances @xmath73 for @xmath74 . to quantitatively determine the temperature influence on the noise one has to consider the finite temperature expressions for the green s functions in ( [ gfbosonic ] ) for the bosonic fields .",
    "@xcite    ^s(0,t ) ^s(0,0 ) = _ s with @xmath62 .",
    "the tunneling rate can be still analytically evaluated for temperatures lower than the bandwidths , namely @xmath75 , leading to ^(m)(e ) & = & t^+-1e^ + & & b(+-i ; + + i ) + being @xmath76 the euler beta function @xcite ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) . at higher temperatures the rate",
    "have to be evaluated numerically.@xcite    close to the josephson frequencies , the noise in ( [ noise_freq_curr ] ) reduces to s_b^(m)(m _ 0 ) tg_b^(m)(t ) [ scaling_peaks ] written in terms of the @xmath27-agglomerate linear conductance g_b^(m)(t)=(m e^*)^2 . the power - law behavior for the height of the peaks as a function of the temperature is therefore given by @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "the visibility of the @xmath13-agglomerate peak is guaranteed in this regime for @xmath81 .",
    "as stated before , for the composite edge states belonging to the jain sequence , important information about the carrier charges involved in the tunneling can be extracted from the knowledge of the total noise at finite frequency in ( [ totalnoise ] ) .",
    "each @xmath27-agglomerate contribution leads to a resonance at @xmath82 .",
    "this enable us to resolve them and to obtain indications of their power - law behavior .",
    "depending on their scaling dimensions , they show peaks ( for @xmath83 ) , dips ( for @xmath84 ) or a monotonic increasing as a function of frequency ( for @xmath85 ) .",
    "note that , for notational convenience , we generically indicated with @xmath86 both the low energy scaling dimension in ( [ scaling ] ) and the effective scaling above the neutral mode bandwidth in ( [ scaling_eff ] ) depending on the considered regime . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the behavior of the spectral noise for the considered @xmath0 case at low temperature ( @xmath87 mk ) .    the ratio @xmath88 is plotted in order to recover the proper value of the fano factor in the zero frequency limit .",
    "@xcite to further simplify the description , we only focus on the first two contributions to the noise , namely single - qp and @xmath13-agglomerate , neglecting the contributions due to other possible excitations .",
    "various curves correspond to different values of the applied bias , namely different @xmath89 .",
    "note that in the figure the frequency is rescaled with respect to @xmath70 .    for @xmath90 ( dotted magenta and short - dashed blue curves )",
    "it is easy to note a pronounced peak in correspondence of @xmath91 due to the single - qp contribution . despite",
    "the fact the temperature is very low , thermal effects leads to a smoothening of the peak .",
    "a second contribution , less pronounced , is observable at @xmath92 , signature of the presence of the @xmath13-agglomerate that has a less divergent power - law behavior .",
    "this secondary peaks becomes more and more evident by increasing @xmath70 .    for bias voltages such that @xmath93 ( long - dashed green and solid red curves ) the neutral mode contribution increases the scaling dimension turning the single - qp peak into an extremely broad dip that completely hides the @xmath13-agglomerate contribution .",
    "this is a clear demonstration of the fact that the ideal condition to observe the peak patter for the @xmath0 case is @xmath94 .",
    "a remark is in order concerning the role of the temperature .",
    "indeed , the smoothening induced by thermal effects could completely wash away the observed structure under the condition @xmath95 , therefore very low temperature are needed to see this structure .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the finite frequency noise for the fqh state at @xmath96 .",
    "we considered the presence of the two more relevant excitations : the single - qp , with charge @xmath97 , and the @xmath13-agglomerate , with charge @xmath98 .",
    "the finite frequency noise has the unique possibility to resolve _ spectroscopically _ the contributions of the different excitations looking at different josephson resonances .",
    "we showed that the peak associated to the @xmath13-agglomerate is more evident at josephson frequency higher than the neutral mode cut - off , where the tail of the single - qp contribution decreases faster .",
    "we also commented on the evolution of the height of the single - qp peak as a function of temperature , in order to determine the optimal condition for the visibility of the considered peak pattern .",
