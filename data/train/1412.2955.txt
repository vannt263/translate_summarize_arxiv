    "rare b decays are mediated by flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath5 transitions which are absent in the standard model ( sm ) at tree level .",
    "the leading contribution comes from one loop diagrams .",
    "being gim and ckm suppressed , their predictions in sm are very tiny .",
    "as these processes are very sensitive to heavy particles in the loops , any effect from new physics ( np ) will show significant deviation from sm predictions . this make these decays assets for indirect probes of np .",
    "so far data collected by dedicated experiments ( lhcb , b - factories ) on rare b - decays are in excellent agreement with the predictions of sm and have been used to retrieve information on flavor structure of possible new physics and have put stringent constraints on beyond standard model ( bsm ) scenarios but expectations of looking for any definitive hints of np have not met with success .",
    "the results seems to be in consistency with ckm mechanism of sm @xcite .",
    "however , recent data on angular observables of @xmath6 four body distribution indicate a plausible change in this situation .",
    "lhcb has observed a 3.7@xmath7 level deviation from sm prediction in one of the angular observables , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy might be a result of statistical fluctuations or inevitable theoretical uncertaiities that enter in calculation of these observables @xcite .",
    "one has to wait for more experimental data and a more careful analysis of theoretical uncertainties to clear the smoke . assuming that this discrepency is solely due to np effects , there have been attempts in literature to resolve this tension between theory and experimental side with solutions having various np scenarios ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this piece of work , we study some of the angular observables @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 and a new observable , which we we call @xmath4 , with a different approach .",
    "we look at zeroes of these observables .",
    "the expressions , under certain reasonable assumptions , are more or less independent of theoretical uncertainties , and depend solely on short distance wilson coefficients , and thus have very clean predictions in sm .",
    "precise measurement of these quantities gives certain relations among wilson coefficients and thus provide very clean test of sm .",
    "+ we proceed as follows . in the next section , we define effective hamiltonian for @xmath9 . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the 4-body angular distribution of @xmath6 and various observables in in large energy recoil limit . in section iv",
    ", we calculate zeroes of these observables including a new observable @xmath4 and obtain correlation among them . in section",
    "v , we summarise and conclude .",
    "the basic framework to study rare fcnc decays where qcd corrections can give sizeable contributions is that of effective hamiltonian which is obtained after integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "the rare decay @xmath10 is governed by effective hamiltonian for @xmath11 transitions written as @xmath12 where contribution of the term @xmath13 is neglected .",
    "@xmath14 are the effective local operators and their coefficients @xmath15 are called wilson coefficients evaluated at scale @xmath16 .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath16 distinguishes between short distance physics ( above scale @xmath16 ) and long distance physics ( below scale @xmath16 ) .",
    "wilson coefficients depend on factorization scale and are the only source of information about heavy degrees of freedom which have been integrated out while matrix elements of local operators @xmath14 dictate the low energy dynamics ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the operators contributing significantly to the process @xmath10 in sm are semileptonic vector operator @xmath17 , axial vector operator @xmath18 and magnetic photon penguin operator @xmath19 .",
    "their explicit form is given by @xmath20 here , @xmath21 are the color indices , @xmath22 represent chiral projections , @xmath23 are the su(3 ) color charges . @xmath24 is the b - quark mass .",
    "the primed operators have same tensorial structure as unprimed ones but with helicity flipped . their contribution within sm",
    "is severely suppressed or vanishes .",
    "+ the effective coefficient of operator @xmath17 is given by @xmath25 here @xmath26 is lepton invariant mass and @xmath27 is the invariant mass @xmath28 normalized by b - meson mass square , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is one loop function and contains contribution from one loop matrix elements of operators @xmath31 .",
    "the form of function @xmath32 can be found in @xcite . due to",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 is not real but has a small imaginary part . for calculating zeroes of different observables and getting analytic relations among them",
    ", we will treat these wilson coefficients as real and also neglect small @xmath32 but for numerical calculations we include @xmath32 in @xmath33 .",
    "as will be evident later , this turns out to be a good working approximation .",
    "to calculate observables for @xmath35 process , one needs to calculate matrix elements of the local operators @xmath36 .",
    "these matrix elements are usually expressed in terms of seven form factors @xmath37 and @xmath38 which are functions of momentum transfer between b and @xmath39 .",
    "these form factors are calculated via non - perturbative methods like qcd sum rules on the light cone ( lcsrs ) @xcite when daughter mesons energies are large .",
    "working in qcd factorization ( qcdf ) framework , and within heavy quark and large recoil limit , all seven seven form factors can be written in terms of only two independent universal factors , namely , @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite . the decay amplitude can be represented as @xmath42 , with a corresponding to polarization of @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 contains factorizable and non factorizable correction which are calculated in perturbation theory with the help of renormalization group ( rg ) techniques . +",
    "the two set of form factors are related to each other through following identities ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath46    the 4-body angular distribution of @xmath47 offers experimentally accessible observables which are independent of form factors and hence theoretically cleaner . the fully differential decay distribution can be described by four kinematical variables , given by @xmath48 where kinematical variables dilepton invariant mass @xmath3 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined in @xcite and @xmath52 the angular coefficients @xmath53 are generally expressed in terms of transversity amplitude .",
    "there are in total seven transversity amplitudes .",
    "there will be an additional amplitudes once scalar interactions are also taken into account which we do not consider in this work . at the leading order in @xmath54 and",
    "@xmath55 the transversity amplitudes render to following simple expression : @xmath56 \\xi_\\bot ( e_{k^*}),\\ ] ]    @xmath57 \\xi_\\bot ( e_{k^*}),\\ ] ]    @xmath58 \\xi_\\parallel ( e_{k^*}),\\ ] ]    @xmath59 \\xi_\\parallel ( e_{k^*})\\ ] ]    here , @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the energy of @xmath39 meson .",
    "terms of @xmath62 have been neglected .",
    "however it is worth mentioning that these relations holds only in the kinematical region @xmath63 .",
    "this is precisely the region of interest + there are 12 angular coefficients @xmath53 and considering @xmath64 ( corresponding to cp conjugate mode of @xmath65 ) , there are in total 24 angular coefficients .",
    "the cp conjugated coefficients @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 with weak phases conjugated .",
    "one can construct , taking certain ratios and combinations such that form factors and hadronic uncertainties pertaining to such observables more or less cancel and we are left with observables which are cleaner and have high sensitivity to np effect .",
    "one can define such cp -averaged and cp violating observables as in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the zero of the forward backward asymmetry of the lepton pair in the decay @xmath68 is highly insensitive to form factors and precise measurement of this quantity can reveal new physics @xcite .",
    "the zero of forward backward asymmetry is known to depend on ratios of form factors , value of b quark mass and wilson coefficients @xmath69 and @xmath33 . however , in the heavy quark limit and in the region where energy of @xmath43 @xmath70 is comparable with b - meson mass , the hadronic uncertainties cancel in ratios of form factors and , to a good approximation , zero of the forward backward asymmetry of the lepton pair is essentially independent of form factor uncertainties .",
    "the position of the zero is thus heralded as a test of sm since the position shifts significantly for most models beyond sm .",
    "the zero of the forward backward asymmetry is given by a clean relation : @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is position of the zero of the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "taking it as cue , we investigate other observables , particularly @xmath1 and @xmath0 as there has been a tension between sm prediction and experimental data for these observables in one of the bins .",
    "+ to bring out the power to differentiate various np scenarios , we calculate the zeroes of some of the angular observables including the primed operators as well .",
    "the associated wilson coefficients are assumed to be real for simplicity though it is straight forward to generalise the relations below to complex coefficients .",
    "this is not necessary for the present as our main motivation is to study the situation within sm , where as we show below , there are tight correlations of the zeroes of the angular observables considered and the zero of the forward backward asymmetry . we also propose a new observable , @xmath4 , defined below .",
    "this new observable , and its zero , carries quite a complimentary information compared to the observables already studied in literature . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such correlations and their impact as in providing a litmus test for sm has not been studied before .",
    "we would again like to emphasize that the analytic expressions below have been obtained by neglecting the @xmath32 contribution from @xmath33 and treating the leptons as massless .",
    "however , in the numerical evaluations , we have retained the @xmath32 contribution and have massive leptons .",
    "+ to calculate zeros of any of the observables , one needs to look solution of numerator only .",
    "we set them to zero and obtain the solution .",

    "@xmath4 : apart from these observables , we also construct a new observable , @xmath4 , which has following form @xmath82 the zero of the observable @xmath4 is given by @xmath83      it is very interesting to consider these relations in the limit of sm : set @xmath84 .",
    "further , we exploit the fact that within sm , numerically , @xmath85 . employing these and simplifying",
    ", we obtain : @xmath86 which matches with the relation ( 11 ) within large recoil limit .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has measured the point of zero crossing of the forward backward asymmetry zero : @xmath87 = ( 4.9 @xmath88 0.9 ) @xmath89 @xcite + in the case of @xmath1 , setting primed wilson coefficients equal to zero in equation ( 12 ) , relation reduces to @xmath90 so the relations predicts value of zero of @xmath1 to be approximately half of forward - backward asymmetry zero .",
    "+ in the sm limit the zero of @xmath0 reads @xmath91 where in the last step , we have again used the fact that @xmath72 is very small compared to 1 .",
    "so , the prediction for the zero of @xmath0 is also about half of @xmath72 .",
    "+ if we keep the effect of factor @xmath72 in expressions of zeroes of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , we see that actual value of the zero of @xmath92 is a little larger than half of @xmath72 while the zero of @xmath0 lies a bit below half of @xmath72 , but as clearly evident from table 2 , the effect is rather small and can be safely neglected .",
    "+ the case of the proposed new observable @xmath4 is special one .",
    "the expressions of zero of forward backward asymmetry ( 12 ) and @xmath4 ( 15 ) have interesting features . in the sm limit , the position of the two zeroes coincides while this degeneracy is lifted in a simple but complimentary manner when the helicity flipped operators are present . + the expressions of zeroes of these observables depend only on wilson coefficients , practically independent of form factors , thereby leading to theoretically clean predictions .",
    "to calculate these zeroes , we use @xmath93 = 4.2297 , @xmath94 = -4.2068 , @xmath69 = -0.2974 @xcite at scale @xmath24 . in our numerical analysis , we use the values of input parameters given in table i.    .values of input parameters used for numerical calculations of zeroes of observables [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "with the latest experimental results on angular observables of @xmath6 showing discrepancies with respect to sm , one would like to hope to have found first evidence of new physics .",
    "but due to uncertainties inherent in the theoretical calculations of such processes , it is difficult to infer the same in affirmation . precise measurements of theoretically clean observables holds the best chance of unambiguously revealing the presence of physics beyond sm , if any .",
    "the zero of the forward backward asymmetry is known to fall under this category of observables .",
    "the current measurement is not precise enough to say anything definitive and is totally consistent with sm",
    ". it may be useful to have more such observables measured with precision . with this picture in mind ,",
    "we point out that zeroes of forward backward asymmetry , @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 ( a new angular observable proposed in this work ) , can be crucial test of sm .",
    "it has been pointed out that within sm , the position of all the zeroes is essentially fixed by the zero of the forward backward asymmetry , up to small corrections . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to use such correlations as a stringent test of sm itself .",
    "the relations are quite rich and general as they include wilson coefficients of helicity flipped operators also .",
    "the relations are obtained in large recoil region in large energy limit where estimates of theoretical uncertainties are supposed to be minimalistic .",
    "a simultaneous accurate determination of these zeroes will surely provide a conclusive evidence of any np present .",
    "moreover , in a general setting , the zeroes by themselves carry complimentary information about the wilson coefficients and their measurement together with the existing data can be used to pin point the class of np scenarios which can give rise to such predictions .",
    "this is clearly evident from the position of the zero of the proposed observable @xmath4 which in the standard model limit yields the same value as the zero of forward backward asymmetry but when the helicity flipped operators are included , leads to complimentary information on the wilson coefficients compared to the zero of forward backward asymmetry .",
    "we also hope that with more data , not just the position of various zeroes , but also the complete profiles of angular observables will be known with high precision , which can be used further as a crucial test of the standard model .",
