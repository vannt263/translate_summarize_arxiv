    "the human brain consists of about @xmath0 nerve cells that can be subdivided into about 1000 different cell types , a complexity that far exceeds that of other organs of the body .",
    "a further complexity is evident in the way in which the component cells of the brain interconnect and function @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other types of the cells , each neuron communicates with many target cells by means of its distinctive protoplasmatic protrusion , called an axon . axons with similar destinations , in turn , tend to form bundles - known as neural fibre tracts - which play a pivotal role in the determination of brain connectivity . through reconstructing the pattern of connectivity of the neural tracts in both healthy and diseased subjects ,",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain an abundance of valuable diagnostic information that could be used for early diagnostics of brain - related disorders , for assessing the damage caused to the brain by stroke , tumours or injuries , as well as for planning and monitoring of neurosurgeries @xcite .",
    "central to mri is the notion of contrast , which is typically defined by the biochemical composition of interrogated tissue as well as by the morphology of its associated parenchyma .",
    "prevalent in mri practice are the contrasts determined by the t@xmath1/t@xmath2 relaxation times and proton density ( pd ) . despite their exceptional importance to clinical diagnosis",
    ", none of the above contrast mechanisms has demonstrated effectiveness in delineating the morphological structure of the white matter .",
    "it is only with the advent of diffusion mri ( dmri ) that scientists have been able to perform quantitative measurements of the diffusivity of white matter , based on which its structural delineation has become possible @xcite .",
    "although over the last two decades dmri has developed into an established technique with a great impact on health care and neurosciences , like any other mri technique it remains subject to artifacts and pitfalls @xcite . while many of such artifacts can be overcome by using advanced hardware designs and/or more sophisticated imaging protocols ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.2 ) , @xcite , one particularly critical limitation of dmri stems from the physics of the acquisition of diffusion mr images , and therefore is impossible to resolve by operational means .",
    "specifically , since collecting the dmri data requires a repetitive acquisition of mr responses from the same volume for a number of diffusion - encoding gradients , it is the relatively long acquisition times that greatly impair the practical value of this important imaging modality .",
    "particularly , longer acquisition times entail a higher probability for the patient to exercise involuntary motion ( typically caused by fatigue and/or stress related tremors , swallowing , uncontrollable sighing or coughing ) , which severely affects the quality of dmri data . moreover , since during the whole duration of the scan the patients are required to remain motionless , it is currently deemed ineffective to apply dmri - based diagnosis in paediatrics as well as to patients with dementia or post - traumatic injuries , where non - compliance is typical .",
    "the problem of long acquisition times also hampers the application of dmri for intra - operational imaging , where it could be an irreplaceable tool to use for neurosurgical planning and decision - making support @xcite .",
    "lastly , relatively long scanning times required by dmri aggravate the problem of accessibility to mri equipment .",
    "all the above arguments suggest that the practical value of dmri could be improved by shortening the scanning times required for acquisition of dmri data . a particular method to achieve such an improvement",
    "is detailed in this paper .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt a general diffusion model in which each voxel within a region of interest ( roi ) is allowed to support more than one fibre tract . in this case , under some general assumptions ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) for more details ) , the diffusion signal @xmath3 originating from a voxel with spatial coordinate @xmath4 containing @xmath5 fibres can be modelled as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the spherical coordinate , i.e. @xmath8 and @xmath9 are positive weights obeying @xmath10 . in ( [ multimodel ] ) , @xmath11 denotes the diffusion signal obtained in the absence of diffusion encoding ( i.e. the so - called  b0 image \" ) , @xmath12 is defined as a function of the shape and amplitude of diffusion - encoding gradients ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.18 ) , and @xmath13 are @xmath14 diffusion tensors associated with the @xmath5 neural fibres passing through the coordinate @xmath15 . in practical settings ,",
    "the spherical coordinate @xmath7 is sampled at @xmath16 distinct points @xmath17 over the unit sphere . in this case , for each @xmath18 , mr measurements are acquired in the form of a diffusion - encoded image @xmath19 . as a result , a typical dmri data set consists of a collection of such diffusion - encoded images @xmath20 , whose size @xmath16 determines the accuracy with which the directions of local diffusion flows can be estimated .",
    "provided unlimited scanning time , one could measure the diffusion in thousands of orientations , making it possible to identify the directions of dominant diffusion with very high precision .",
    "for the reasons explained earlier , however , scanning times are always limited , which necessitates restriction of @xmath16 to a reasonably small value .",
    "this brings us to the central question addressed in the present paper : what is a sufficient number @xmath16 of diffusion - encoding directions to use ?",
    "it turns out that , for some realizations of dmri , the above question can be answered in a rigorous manner . in particular , in diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) @xcite , the reconstruction is carried out under the assumption that each voxel can support only one diffusion flow as most , which corresponds to setting @xmath21 for all @xmath15 in ( [ multimodel ] ) .",
    "accordingly , a minimum of @xmath22 diffusion - encoded images are theoretically sufficient to measure @xmath23 and recover the six non - repetitive components of the symmetric tensors @xmath24 by means of least - square fitting .",
    "( in practice , however , a larger number of gradient directions is employed to reduce the estimation variance , with a typical @xmath16 being between 25 and 30 @xcite . )",
    "unfortunately , the accuracy of dti is known to deteriorate dramatically at the sites where the neural fibres ( or bundles thereof ) cross , touch upon each other , or diverge @xcite .",
    "the fibre crossing problem in dti has prompted efforts to develop dmri methodologies which are capable of detecting multiple diffusion flows ( or , equivalently , neural fibre tracts ) within a given voxel .",
    "one of such techniques is high angular resolution diffusion imaging ( hardi)@xcite , which is capable of capturing multi - modal diffusion patterns by sampling the spherical shell at a much greater number of points ( usually between 60 and 100 ) as compared to the case of dti .",
    "increasing @xmath16 makes it possible to describe the diffusion measurements using much more accurate models . among these are parametric models",
    "@xcite which allow hardi signals to be expressed in terms of a relatively small number of prototype signal forms",
    ". unfortunately , fitting a parametric model often entails minimization of non - convex functionals , which is a noise - sensitive and computationally intensive task , prone to the problem of local minima .",
    "the need to predetermine the optimal number of fitting terms is known to be another disadvantage of using the models of the above type .",
    "the problems associated with parametric modelling of hardi signals can be overcome by using non - parametric models , in which case the signals are recovered by projecting the observed data onto properly defined functional subspaces . in particular , the applicability of spherical fourier analysis @xcite to dmri has been demonstrated in @xcite , where hardi signals are approximated by truncated series of spherical harmonics ( sh ) . despite its stability and computational efficiency , however , the sh - parameterization involves a relatively large number of shs , which suggests that the shs can not be an adequate basis for sparse representation of hardi signals .",
    "the main reason for this is rooted in the fact that the energies of elementary signals @xmath25 in ( [ multimodel ] ) are concentrated alongside the great circles of @xmath26 , whereas the energy of shs is spread all over @xmath26 , and , as a result , a relatively large number of shs are needed to effectively  encode \" each of @xmath27 .",
    "the inability of the basis of shs to sparsely represent diffusion signals has led to the proposal of spherical ridgelets in @xcite , where it was shown that it only takes 6 to 8 spherical ridgelets on average to represent the hardi signals with a precision exceeding the precision of their representation with 45 shs .",
    "the present work takes the ideas of @xcite one step further and shows that the availability of a sparsifying basis for hardi signals can be used to reduce the number of diffusion gradients required for data acquisition .",
    "in particular , we suggest to use the theory of compressed sensing ( cs ) @xcite to recover the hardi signals using the number of spherical samples @xmath16 in a range of values typical for dti ( i.e. @xmath28 $ ] ) , thus allowing a multi - fibre analysis of dmri data to be performed at the  acquisition cost \" of a standard dti .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the ideas of cs have already paved their way into the field of diffusion imaging @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "conceptually the closest to the proposed approach is the method reported in @xcite . in spite of this similarity",
    ", however , there are two principal distinctions which make the present method a more powerful alternative . in particular , the basis functions used in @xcite are limited to represent an _ average _ diffusivity and anisotropy of the white matter , thereby neglecting both intra- and inter - voxel variability of tensors @xmath29 in ( [ multimodel ] ) .",
    "the ridgelet representation , on the other hand , is a multiresolution technique , which possesses an intrinsic ability to deal with a continuum of different diffusion scales .",
    "second , the approach in @xcite is applied in a ",
    "voxel - by - voxel \" manner and it therefore does not take into consideration the spatial regularity of diffusion field .",
    "the present paper , on the other hand , proposes a novel formulation of the problem of cs - based reconstruction of diffusion signals , in which the sparsity constraints enforced in the diffusion domain are augmented by regularity constraints enforced in the spatial domain .",
    "the resulting reconstruction problem has the format of a convex minimization problem , which is solved using a specially adapted version of the split bregman algorithm @xcite . as will be shown below , the proposed algorithm results in a particularly advantageous computational structure which allows the solution to be computed via a sequence of simple and easily parallelizable steps .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides additional comments on the input - output structure of the proposed algorithm . the construction of spherical ridgelets is briefly outlined in section iii , whereas section iv gives a formal description of the proposed reconstruction methodology .",
    "some principal details on the numerical implementations of the proposed algorithm are summarized in section v , with the results of our experimental studies reported in section vi .",
    "section vii finalizes the paper with a discussion and conclusions .",
    "in the centre of our considerations is the diffusion signal @xmath30 which , when normalized by its related @xmath31-image @xmath32 , quantifies the attenuation of mr readout caused by the diffusion of water molecules in the direction @xmath33 through the spatial position @xmath4 . in practical settings ,",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath15 are discretized . specifically , restricting @xmath7 to a discrete set of orientations @xmath17 prescribes the acquisition of diffusion data in the form of @xmath16 diffusion - encoded images @xmath20 , with each @xmath34 corresponding to a given @xmath18 . in this case , for a fixed @xmath35 , the vector @xmath36^t \\in \\mathbb{r}^k$ ] represents a discretization of @xmath37 .",
    "note that such a discretization follows a linear measurement model , since each sample @xmath38 can be represented as an inner product of @xmath37 with a sampling function . in particular , let @xmath39 be a dirac basis of sampling functions defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the dirac delta function and the dot stands for the euclidean dot product . then , formally , @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the standard rotation invariant measure on @xmath26",
    ".    next , given a collection of @xmath44 spherical ridgelets @xmath45 ( defined below ) , the signal @xmath30 is assumed to be expandable as @xmath46 with @xmath47 being a vector of spherical ridgelet coefficients which depend on the spatial coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "it is important to note that the set of spherical ridgelets is allowed to be overcomplete , implying @xmath48 < m$ ] .",
    "a practical consequence of this fact is that the definition of coefficients @xmath49 in ( [ represent ] ) is , in general , not unique .",
    "this non - uniqueness is further aggravated by the fact that @xmath49 will have to be recovered from an under - sampled set of diffusion measurements , in which case @xmath50 .",
    "overcoming such a severe underdetermination in the problem of estimating the ridgelet coefficients @xmath49 will be possible based on the fundamental premise of the theory of cs , which states that an accurate estimation of @xmath49 is possible if the latter is sufficiently sparse _ and _ if the sampling and representation bases are sufficiently decorrelated . while the sparsity of @xmath49 is rooted in the very design of spherical ridgelets @xcite , the incoherency between the dirac sampling functions ( [ diracs ] ) and spherical ridgelets stems from the fact that the former have an infinitely small support , whereas the latter are  smeared \" all over the unit sphere .",
    "the above properties of the basis of spherical ridgelets yield conditions for an effective application of cs , in which case one can obtain a faithful reconstruction of diffusion signals using as few as @xmath51 diffusion - encoding gradients .",
    "the proposed algorithm produces an estimate of the ridgelet representation coefficients @xmath49 in ( [ represent ] ) .",
    "once available , the coefficients provide an access to the analytical definition of diffusion signals by virtue of ( [ represent ] ) .",
    "this can be used in a number of ways .",
    "one possibility could be to use the ridgelet coefficients to compute their associated orientation distribution functions @xcite , based on which a multi - fibre tractography analysis can be done @xcite . alternatively , ( [ represent ] ) can be used to evaluate the diffusion signals over an arbitrarily fine grid of orientations .",
    "subsequently , such refined  measurements \" could be fitted using a different representation model , whose application to the original data would not have been possible without causing severe underestimation errors . deconvolving the refined data to estimate the underlying fibre orientation functions @xcite would be another important option to follow . in this paper , we refrain from questioning which of the above possibilities is more advantageous over the others .",
    "our sole objective here is to specify a signal processing algorithm which can be used to recover hardi signals , while using the number of diffusion - encoded images typical for a standard dti .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the primarily purpose of the proposed methodology is to improve the value of hardi in terms of its time efficiency .",
    "since the improvement is achieved through merely decreasing the number of diffusion - encoding gradients , the proposed method by no means abrogates the use of fast imaging protocols @xcite to further accelerate the data acquisition .",
    "furthermore , an additional speed - up can be achieved via applying cs to reconstruct the diffusion encoded images @xmath34 from their subcritical samples in the spectral domain @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "we believe this is a combination of such software and hardware technologies which will eventually lead to substantantial improvements in the practical value of hardi - based diagnosing . in this paper , however , we confine our contribution to showing one particular way of attaining this important objective .",
    "it is the property of spherical ridgelets to provide sparse representation of diffusion signals described by ( [ multimodel ] ) which makes them an unparalleled tool for cs - reconstruction of hardi data . to avoid repetitions , in what follows ,",
    "we present only the most principal points of ridgelets design , while their detailed description can be found in @xcite .",
    "spherical ridgelets are constructed using the fundamental principles of wavelet theory @xcite .",
    "specifically , let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be a positive scaling parameter .",
    "further , let @xmath54 be a gaussian function , which we subject to a series of dyadic scalings to result in @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "subsequently , the gaussian - weierstrass scaling function @xmath57 at resolution @xmath58 and orientation @xmath59 can be defined as given by @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the legendre polynomial of order @xmath62 .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath63 energy of @xmath64 is concentrated around the spherical point @xmath65 , with this concentration becoming more and more localized when @xmath66 approaches infinity .",
    "the spherical ridgelets are designed with the help of the funk - radon transform which , for an arbitrary continuous function @xmath67 , is defined as @xmath68 with @xmath69 denoting the great circle perpendicular to direction @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath70 .",
    "subsequently , following @xcite , the semi - discrete frame @xmath71 of spherical ridgelets can be defined as @xmath72 where the spherical ridgelet functions @xmath73 are obtained from @xmath64 according to @xmath74 with @xmath75 . using ( [ wgf ] ) , the ridgelets ( [ above ] ) can be redefined in a closed form as ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78    the set @xmath71 in ( [ uset ] ) is infinite - dimensional , and hence is not suitable for practical computations . to define a discrete counterpart of @xmath71 , one has first to restrict the values of the resolution index @xmath66 to a finite set @xmath79 , where @xmath80 defines the highest level of `` detectable '' signal details . additionally , the set of all possible _ orientations _ @xmath81 of spherical ridgelets needs to be discretized as well . to find a proper discretization scheme",
    ", we first note that the construction in ( [ ridgelets ] ) suggests that the bandwidth of the spherical ridgelets ( and therefore the dimensionality of the functional space they belong to ) increases proportionally to @xmath82 .",
    "since the space of spherical harmonics of degree @xmath62 has a dimension of @xmath83 , it seems to be reasonable to define the number of ridgelet orientations at resolution @xmath66 to be equal to @xmath84 , with @xmath85 being the smallest spherical order resulting in @xmath86 for some predefined @xmath87 ( e.g. @xmath88 ) .",
    "consequently , for each @xmath66 , a total of @xmath89 orientations @xmath90 are chosen so that a discrete counterpart of @xmath71 can now be defined as @xmath91 where the subscript @xmath92 stands for  discrete \" .",
    "it should be noted that , although the set @xmath93 is composed of continuously defined functions , its dimension is finite , since @xmath93 consists of a total of @xmath94 spherical ridgelets . to slightly simplify our notation , in what follows ,",

    "however , if it is known _ a priori _ that , for each @xmath122 , the vector of representation coefficients @xmath49 is sparse , then a useful estimate of @xmath146 can be obtained as a solution to the following convex optimization problem @xcite @xmath157 it should be noted that the optimization problem ( [ l11 ] ) is equivalent to solving @xmath158 and therefore , under the assumption of spatially homogeneous noise @xmath159 , the problem ( [ l11 ] ) is separable in the spatial coordinate @xmath15 .",

    "however , as the retained points are not explicitly constrained to lie on a hemisphere , they may include nearly antipodal pairs which are likely to introduce undesirable dependencies between the diffusion measurements as well as between the basis functions .",

    "lastly , the bounded variation model could be substituted by an alternative model , which could ( possibly ) provide a better account for the spatial regularity of hardi signals . exploring the above options",

    "<S> despite the relative recency of its inception , the theory of compressive sampling ( aka compressed sensing ) ( cs ) has already revolutionized multiple areas of applied sciences , a particularly important instance of which is medical imaging . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the theory appears to provide an answer to the important problem of optimal sampling in mri , with an ever - increasing body of works reporting stable and accurate reconstruction of mri scans from the number of spectral measurements which would have been deemed unacceptably small as recently as five years ago . </S>",
    "<S> reducing the number of mr measurements per scan comes to address one of the most critical impediments intrinsic in mri , which is the relatively slow speed of image acquisition . </S>",
    "<S> although very significant , such an improvement may still be insufficient in the cases when a repetitive acquisition of mri scans pertaining to the same volume of interest is required . </S>",
    "<S> acquisitions of this type are prevalent in diffusion mri , in which an independent mri scan is required to encode the strength of water diffusion along a predefined spatial direction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for example , an accurate delineation of multimodal diffusion profiles by means of high angular resolution diffusion imaging ( hardi ) requires using between 60 and 100 diffusion - encoding gradients . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , is translated into relatively long acquisition times , which adversely affects the applicability of hardi for clinical diagnosing . to overcome this limitation , </S>",
    "<S> the present paper introduces a method for substantial reduction of the number of diffusion encoding gradients required for reliable reconstruction of hardi signals . </S>",
    "<S> the method exploits the theory of cs , which establishes conditions on which a signal of interest can be recovered from its under - sampled measurements , provided that the signal admits a sparse representation in the domain of a linear transform . in the case at hand , </S>",
    "<S> the latter is defined to be spherical ridgelet transformation , which excels in sparsifying hardi signals . </S>",
    "<S> what makes the resulting reconstruction procedure even more accurate is a combination of the sparsity constraints in the diffusion domain with additional constraints imposed on the estimated diffusion field in the spatial domain . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the present paper describes a novel way to combine the diffusion- and spatial - domain constraints to achieve a maximal reduction in the number of diffusion measurements , while sacrificing little in terms of reconstruction accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , details are provided on a particularly efficient numerical scheme which can be used to solve the aforementioned reconstruction problem by means of standard and readily available estimation tools . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is concluded with experimental results which support the practical value of the proposed reconstruction methodology . </S>"
