    "the spectroscopy and reactivity of molecular ions is studied in these traps to unravel their dynamics @xcite and simulate the properties of cold plasmas , such as the earth s atmosphere or the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "radiofrequency ions traps have effective trap depths of the order of 1ev , in contrast to traps for neutral atoms or molecules , which are based on interactions of the electric or magnetic dipole moment or the electric polarizability and are typically of the order of 10@xmath0 to 10@xmath1ev @xcite .",
    "this implies that ions that carry a significant amount of kinetic energy can still be trapped .",
    "different approaches exist to cool trapped ions , collisional cooling with a surrounding neutral buffer gas @xcite , laser - cooling on a suitable optical transition @xcite , and - as a combination of these two - sympathetic cooling with jointly trapped laser - cooled ions @xcite .",
    "direct laser cooling of molecules with their manifold of internal quantum states is not possible due to the lack of a closed optical cycling transition .",
    "therefore either the first or the third method is employed to cool _",
    "molecular ions_.    the technique of sympathetic cooling of molecular ions with laser - cooled atomic ions in a joint quadrupole ion trap has been introduced only a few years ago @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully used to cool the translational motion of trapped molecular ions down to temperatures of a few millikelvin .",
    "these extremely cold and localized ions are well suited for photodissociation experiments @xcite and for precision spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "however , ion - ion collisions have been found to leave the internal quantum state distribution unchanged @xcite and are thus not useful for rovibrational cooling of trapped molecular ions . as an alternative",
    ", an optical pumping scheme has been proposed to cool internal degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "recently , first reaction experiments with sympathetically cooled molecular ions have been reported using room temperature neutral reactants @xcite , and - in combination with electrostatically filtered molecules - at relative energies corresponding to about one kelvin @xcite .    in the main part of this article",
    "the focus will be on collisional cooling with a cold neutral buffer gas .",
    "in contrast to sympathetic ion - ion cooling this approach allows one to cool the translational motion as well as the internal rovibrational degrees of freedom at the same time . with helium as the buffer gas , translational and internal temperatures down to a few kelvin",
    "are reached ( see section [ buffergas : sect ] ) .",
    "details of the interaction of the molecular ion with the helium , such as inelastic collision cross sections , determine the time scale for buffer gas cooling but do not inhibit the application in principle .",
    "this technique is therefore applicable to essentially all stable molecular ions over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "in addition , neutral collision partners for chemical reactions are also thermalized to the same temperature .",
    "buffer gas cooling therefore provides good starting conditions for a variety of experiments on ion - neutral reactions and laser spectroscopy under controlled thermal conditions ( see sections [ reactions : sect ] and [ spectroscopy : sect ] ) .    as explained in section [ buffergas : sect ] , buffer gas cooling works best if the interaction of the ion with the confining electric field of the radiofrequency trap is limited to a minimum .",
    "this obvious contradiction is resolved by trapping in higher - order radiofrequency multipole configurations .",
    "these offer a suppressed electric field in the center of the trap and an effective potential that increases much more steeply than the harmonic potential of a quadrupole or paul ion trap . in this way",
    "the confinement in a multipole ion trap comes close to the particle - in - a - box situation with ions moving in an almost field - free volume bound by steep potential walls .",
    "the application of higher order radiofrequency multipole structures for the confinement of charged particles dates back to the 1970ies when the first experiments with radiofrequency multipole ion guides were reported @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional confinement in ion guides allowed precise studies of ion - molecule collision cross sections at relative energies between a few mev and several ev .",
    "this has developed into a widely used method up to the present day @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional confinement in multipole structures has been introduced about a decade later . in octupole",
    "ion traps experiments with laser - cooled ions have been carried out to image the ion density by spatially resolving the fluorescence signal @xcite .",
    "more recently , novel ring - shaped and cylindrical crystals made of laser - cooled ions have been studied in an octupole ion trap @xcite .",
    "the first ion trap with a large field - free region that was employed in experiments was the ring electrode trap @xcite , which could already be cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature .",
    "this lead to extended interaction times of the trapped ions of many seconds instead of just microseconds .",
    "thereby processes that occur with very small cross sections could be studied . with the development of improved cryogenic ion traps , in particular the 22-pole ion trap @xcite , processes such as radiative association @xcite and three - body , complex - forming collisions @xcite could be studied at low temperature .",
    "this also made it possible to investigate low - temperature reactions that are relevant for the understanding of the interstellar medium . in the last ten years",
    "the 22-pole ion trap has become increasingly popular to study ion - molecule reactions and molecular ion spectroscopy .",
    "the concepts of ion guiding and trapping with multipole fields have been discussed extensively in a landmark review by gerlich in 1992 @xcite .",
    "since then major developments have happened , most notably the introduction of the widely used 22-pole ion trap @xcite .",
    "more recently , a few overview articles have reviewed multipole ion traps @xcite and their application in mass spectrometry @xcite and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "this tutorial on multipole rf ion traps starts out presenting the concept of trapping in high - order multipole fields ( next section ) , followed by a discussion of ion cooling with buffer gas ( section [ buffergas : sect ] ) .",
    "then the typically employed experimental techniques are described ( section [ experimental : sect ] ) .",
    "the next two sections are devoted to the two major research areas in which multipole ion traps are used , cold ionic reactions ( section [ reactions : sect ] ) and spectroscopy of internally cold ions ( section [ spectroscopy : sect ] ) .",
    "the outlook ( section [ outlook : sect ] ) highlights several interesting directions that are currently coming into the focus of this research .",
    "multipole ion traps and ion guides typically employ linear radiofrequency electrode geometries that follow a discrete cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the time - varying electric potential of an ideal two - dimensional multipole configuration of order @xmath2 with infinite extension along the @xmath3-direction is given in cylindrical coordinates by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radiofrequency amplitude , @xmath6 the inscribed radius of the rf electrodes ( see fig .  [ fig - multipoles ] ) and @xmath7 denotes the angular frequency . in practice , this potential is created by @xmath8 cylindrical electrodes of radius @xmath9 arranged on a cylinder of inscribed radius @xmath6 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - multipoles ] for several different multipole orders @xmath2 . to achieve a potential that optimally approximates the curvature of the ideal multipole potential of eq .",
    "[ multipole : eq ] to first and second order , the diameter of the rods has to fulfill the relation @xcite @xmath10 for a trap diameter of @xmath11 mm and a rod diameter of @xmath12 mm this leads to @xmath13 , the widely - used 22-pole ion trap .",
    "cross sections through three different linear radiofrequency multipole structures of order @xmath14 , 4 and 8 .",
    "all multipoles are approximated by @xmath8 cylindrical rods of optimal diameter ( see eq .",
    "[ optimal - diameter : eq ] ) . ]",
    "the dynamics of ions in the time - dependent field of a multipole ion trap can not be solved analytically , in contrast to the dynamics in a quadrupole or paul trap , because the equation of motion becomes non - linear in the position coordinate . instead , the best way to describe the dynamics is with the aid of the effective potential approximation , which was originally introduced for rf traps by dehmelt @xcite . for",
    "this one assumes that the position coordinate of a trapped ion is composed of a rapid oscillation @xmath15 that follows the radiofrequency , the micromotion , and a slowly varying drift motion @xmath16 , also referred to as the secular motion , @xmath17 the electric field acting on the ion is expanded in a taylor series , which leads to the equation of motion @xmath18 for short times , of the order of the rf oscillation period , the first and the fourth term of eq .",
    "[ motion : eq ] may be neglected .",
    "this results in a differential equation for @xmath19 that is solved by @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "this describes the micromotion of an ion in the rf field . by averaging eq .",
    "[ motion : eq ] over one rf oscillation period and using the solution for @xmath22 , the second and third terms vanish .",
    "this leads to an equation of motion for the drift coordinate @xmath23 @xmath24 with an effective conservative potential @xmath25 the angle brackets denote the time average over one oscillation period .    for the ideal two - dimensional multipole field of eq .",
    "[ multipole : eq ] one obtains the simple , cylindrically symmetric expression for the effective potential @xmath26 for large @xmath2 this potential increases rapidly with the increasing radius @xmath27 and approximates an effective potential with a large almost field - free central region and steep walls .",
    "the effective potential is intimately related to the ion s micromotion . in fact , from the solution for @xmath19 it follows that the time - averaged kinetic energy of the micromotion equals exactly the effective potential @xmath28 this shows that within the effective potential approximation confinement in the ion trap occurs , because kinetic energy of the drift motion is reversibly converted into kinetic energy of the micromotion , leading to a maximum radius @xmath29 of the ion s drift motion .",
    "the effective potential description breaks down when the amplitude of the micromotion becomes too large for the truncated taylor expansion to be a valid approximation . in this case energy exchange between the micromotion and the secular motion",
    "occurs that increases the amplitude of the secular motion until the ion is lost in a collision with the trap electrodes .",
    "this coupling is important when the electric field amplitude changes significantly over the distance traveled by an ion during one cycle of the micromotion , i.e.  when the stability parameter , introduced by teloy and gerlich @xcite , @xmath30 is no longer a small quantity . for an ideal multipole one obtains @xmath31 note that @xmath32 depends explicitly on the radius of the secular motion for @xmath33 . only for a quadrupole ion trap one",

    "each data point originates from a boltzmann fit to temperature - dependent loss rates .",
    "the breakoff of the effective trap depth s quadratic increase is attributed to the appearance of nonadiabatic ion motion in the trap .",

    "an experimental test of the stability condition in a multipole ion trap has been carried out by studying the loss rate of ions from a 22-pole ion trap @xcite .",
    "the loss rate was found to depend exponentially on an activation energy that was associated with an effective depth of the trapping potential .",
    "the measured effective trap depth as a function of the rf amplitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - evap ] .",
    "it follows eq.[eff_potential : eq ] with @xmath39 for low amplitudes ( with no free parameter ) . above 13v",
    "the trap depth does not increase further , which indicates that for large values of @xmath27 @xmath32 is too large to provide stable trapping .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite show that if an ion finds itself at positions in the trap with such a large @xmath32-value , the effective potential approximation breaks down and the secular kinetic energy of trapped ions is increased in the radiofrequency field .",
    "this _ instability heating _ then leads to trap loss .",
    "a simple evaporation model is used to describe the leveling - off of the measured effective potential .",
    "it assumes a sudden change from stable to unstable motion at a critical radius where @xmath32 becomes larger than a critical value .",
    "this value is determined from a fit to the data to be @xmath40 @xcite , in agreement with the safe operating conditions defined above .",
    "the model for the effective trap depth strongly simplifies the complex non - linear dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , it provides direct experimental evidence for the range of applicability of the effective potential approximation in multipole ion traps .",
    "the trapped ions are cooled in collisions with an inert buffer gas at a well - controlled temperature . typically helium is chosen as buffer gas , because of its high vapor pressure at low temperature .",
    "the buffer gas equilibrates with the gas inlet tubes and the copper housing of the ion trap to its temperature .",
    "the standard model to estimate collision rates of ions with neutral atoms or molecules is the langevin or capture model @xcite .",
    "the assumption of this model is that a collision occurs with 100% probability when the two collision partners come closer to each other than a critical distance .",
    "the impact parameter that belongs to this critical distance is defined by the requirement that the relative kinetic energy is just sufficient to surmount the centrifugal barrier at this impact parameter . for larger impact parameters",
    "the ion - neutral interaction is neglected .",
    "this simplified picture yields the langevin cross section ( in si units ) @xmath41 with the neutral polarizability @xmath42 , the reduced mass of the two - body system @xmath43 and the relative velocity @xmath44 ( @xmath34 is the ion charge and @xmath45 the electric constant ) . in a thermal ensemble",

    "typical values lie in the microsecond regime , given the typical values for the langevin rate of @xmath50@xmath51/s and for the density of @xmath52 to @xmath53@xmath54 . the number of elastic collisions that are required for the ion velocity distribution to resemble a maxwell - boltzmann distribution is estimated with numerical simulations .",

    "is shown ( dashed line ) . ]      in the true time - dependent electric field of a radiofrequency ion trap the fast oscillatory micromotion perturbs the velocity distribution of trapped ions and hinders them to reach the temperature of the buffer gas .",
    "this effect of _ radiofrequency heating _ leads to higher translational temperatures of the trapped ions than the buffer gas temperature . in spectroscopic studies of trapped ions in 22-pole traps",
    "this effect has become visible @xcite .",
    "its dependence on different parameters of the trap has recently been analyzed in detail using numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the effect of radiofrequency heating with a monte carlo simulation that includes the time - dependent potential of an ideal multipole ( eq .  [ multipole : eq ] ) .",
    "the simulation has been carried out for cl@xmath37 in an infinitely long 22-pole ion trap ( @xmath13 ) , filled with 100k helium buffer gas .",
    "the velocity distribution of trapped cl@xmath37 is extracted by following the trajectory of a trapped ion and sampling its instantaneous velocity every two to three collisions with the buffer gas .",
    "this samples the thermal ion velocity distribution in the trap .",
    "the histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig - simulation ] shows the obtained velocity distribution for a buffer gas collision rate of 10@xmath56s@xmath57 and an rf amplitude @xmath58v .",
    "the histogram is fitted with a maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( solid line in fig.[fig - simulation ] ) where the ions translational temperature is the only free parameter .",
    "the numerical data agrees well with a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , but the obtained temperature is @xmath55k , about 6% hotter than the temperature of the helium buffer gas . for comparison , the dashed line shows a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for 100k .    to test the numerical accuracy of the monte - carlo simulation we have calculated the velocity distribution for ions in the time - independent effective potential of a trap with the same trapping parameters . here a temperature of @xmath59k is obtained , in agreement with the expectation of thermalization .",
    "the about 6% increase of the temperature that is found for the time - dependent radiofrequency field can therefore be attributed to radiofrequency heating .",
    "it is caused by elastic collisions with buffer gas atoms that interrupt the micromotion and thereby transfer energy from this motion into the secular motion .",
    "therefore the temperature mismatch decreases with an increased ratio of the ion mass to the buffer gas mass .",
    "the simulations also show that the relative temperature increase is independent of the amplitude of the radiofrequency field , the temperature and the collision rate of the buffer gas across the experimentally relevant parameter range .",
    "the radiofrequency heating and therefore the increase of the effective ion temperature compared to the buffer gas temperature changes notably with the multipole configuration of the ion trap .",
    "the larger the multipole order @xmath2 the smaller is the effective heating rate .",
    "this is qualitatively explained by the shape of the confining effective potential , which represents the kinetic energy of the micromotion .",
    "the steeper the effective potential the more time an ion spends in the almost field - free central region of the trap where buffer gas collisions may not transfer micromotion energy into the secular motion . for large @xmath2 , such as in the 22-pole ion trap",
    ", radiofrequency heating can occur only near the steep wall of the effective potential .",
    "for trapped molecular and cluster ions the thermalization of the translational motion to a temperature near the buffer gas temperature is only the first step .",
    "such complex ions also possess @xmath60 ( @xmath61 for linear molecules ) internal vibrational degrees of freedom and three ( two for linear molecules ) rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "inelastic collisions with the buffer gas can be employed to also thermalize these degrees of freedom .    for internal cooling ,",
    "the relative kinetic energy of the ion - neutral collision system is the relevant quantity that determines the ion s internal excitation in steady state . in the case of weak radiofrequency heating the ion s",
    "translational velocity distribution follows a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , as discussed above . in this case",
    "the effective temperature of the relative motion is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the translational temperature and @xmath65 and @xmath66 the masses of the neutral and the ion , respectively .",
    "this shows that heavy ions and clusters in helium buffer gas may reach internal temperatures near the buffer gas temperature , even if their translational temperature is affected by radiofrequency heating .",
    "experimentally , both rotational @xcite and vibrational cooling @xcite have been observed .",
    "the time scale for equilibration of the internal degrees of freedom is typically estimated to be longer than for elastic collisions , because the inelastic rate coefficient is often significantly smaller than the langevin limit .",
    "precise values are rare for most molecular ions , but estimates range between 10 to 10@xmath67 collisions that are needed to achieve collisional thermalization . besides this mechanism",
    ", spontaneous radiative emission may also remove internal energy from the trapped ions .",
    "this holds in particular for stiff vibrational degrees of freedom where the radiative lifetimes lie in the millisecond range @xcite , which leads to radiative cooling rates that are comparable with collisional cooling rates .",
    "the most widely used multipole ion trap configuration consists of @xmath8 cylindrical stainless steel electrodes that are arranged around a cylinder with inscribed radius @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - multipoles ] ) .",

    "they are complemented with variable power resistive heaters to increase the temperature to higher values in a controlled way .",
    "ions are typically not formed in the cryogenic , high vacuum environment of the trap itself .",
    "instead they are created in a separate ion source and loaded into the trap through one of the end electrodes .",
    "a variety of ion sources are used , continuous electron impact ion sources , plasma sources , radiofrequency storage ion sources , pulsed supersonic beam sources and electrospray ionization sources .",

    "the ions are accelerated and mass - selected by time - of - flight before the selected ion packet is decelerated and loaded into the ion trap @xcite . trapping occurs either by opening the electrostatic end electrode for the entering ions and closing it after the ions have entered the ion trap . alternatively the ions are kept at a high enough kinetic energy to overcome the potential of the static end electrode and are then decelerated rapidly by buffer gas collisions inside the trap before they have a chance to leave the trap again .",
