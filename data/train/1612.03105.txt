    "in this paper , we study the integrability of the nonlinear wave equation @xmath0 containing two arbitrary parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , not equal zero simultaneously .",
    "actually , there is only one essential parameter in , the ratio @xmath3 or @xmath4 , which is invariant under the scale transformations of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not invariant .",
    "we show that this equation is integrable in two ( and , most probably , only two ) distinct cases , namely , when @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which correspond via scale transformations of variables to the equations @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "there is the following reason to study the nonlinear equation .",
    "recently , in @xcite , we studied the integrability of the generalized short pulse equation @xmath12 containing two arbitrary parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , not equal zero simultaneously .",
    "we showed that there are two ( and , most probably , only two ) integrable cases of , namely , those with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which can be written as @xmath13 and @xmath14 via scale transformations of variables .",
    "the nonlinear equation is the celebrated short pulse equation which appeared first in differential geometry @xcite , was later rediscovered in nonlinear optics @xcite , and since then has been studied in almost any aspect of its integrability @xcite . the nonlinear equation , called the single - cycle pulse equation ( due to the property of its smooth envelope soliton solution ) @xcite or the modified short pulse equation @xcite , is a scalar reduction of the integrable system of coupled short pulse equations of feng @xcite .",
    "one may wonder , looking at , why not to generalize this equation further , as @xmath15 with arbitrary parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath16 , in order to find new integrable nonlinear wave equations in this way .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that there are only two essentially different values of the parameter @xmath16 in , namely , @xmath17 and ( without loss of generality ) @xmath18 , because one can always make @xmath18 by a scale transformation of variables if @xmath19 .",
    "since the case of with @xmath18 is the nonlinear equation studied in @xcite , we concentrate in the present paper on the remaining case of with @xmath17 , which is the nonlinear equation .    in section  [ s2 ] of this paper , we transform the nonlinear equation with any finite value of @xmath3 to a corresponding ( in general , nonlinear ) klein  gordon equation whose nonlinearity depends on @xmath3 , and we bring with @xmath20 into a form suitable for the painlev analysis . in section  [ s3 ] , using the known results on integrability of nonlinear klein ",
    "gordon equations ( for @xmath21 ) and the painlev test for integrability ( for @xmath20 ) , we show that the nonlinear equation is integrable if ( and , most probably , only if ) @xmath8 or @xmath9 , that is , when the nonlinear equation is transformable to linear klein  gordon equations .",
    "this allows us to obtain parametric representations for general solutions of the nonlinear equations and and discuss their properties .",
    "section  [ s4 ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "in our experience , a transformation found to relate a new nonlinear equation with a known old one is a powerful tool to derive the fact and character of integrability or non - integrability of the new equation from what is known on integrability or non - integrability of the old equation @xcite . by means of transformations relating new equations with known old ones ,",
    "it is possible to derive analytic properties of solutions @xcite , expressions for special and general solutions @xcite , lax pairs , hamiltonian structures and recursion operators @xcite of the new equations from the corresponding known properties and objects of the old equations .",
    "when @xmath22 in , we have @xmath21 , and we make @xmath23 by a scale transformation of variables , without loss of generality , @xmath24 if @xmath25 , we rewrite as @xmath26 introduce the new dependent variable @xmath27 , @xmath28 and get the nonlinear klein  gordon equation @xmath29 the inverse transformation from to , @xmath30 is also a local transformation , that is , like , it requires no integration .",
    "note that the transformations and between the equations and do not cover the case of @xmath31 .",
    "however , @xmath32 with any function @xmath33 satisfies the nonlinear equation with any values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and this set of special solutions tells nothing about the integrability of .",
    "when @xmath34 in , we introduce the new independent variable @xmath35 , @xmath36 and impose the condition @xmath37 on the function @xmath38 to considerably simplify the result .",
    "then the studied equation takes the form @xmath39 this equation is invariant under the transformation @xmath40 with any function @xmath41 , which means that solutions of the system and determine solutions @xmath42 of parametrically , with @xmath35 being the parameter .",
    "next , we make use of the new dependent variable @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 which means that @xmath45 . since @xmath46 in",
    ", our transformation does not cover the evident special solutions of with @xmath31 .",
    "the compatibility condition @xmath47 for and reads @xmath48 eliminating @xmath49 from and , and using , we get @xmath50 due to , we have to consider the cases of @xmath21 and @xmath20 separately .",
    "if @xmath21 , we make @xmath23 by a scale transformation of variables , without loss of generality . using the new dependent variable @xmath51 , @xmath52 we get @xmath53 from , and @xmath54 from . dividing the left- and right - hand sides of by @xmath55 ( @xmath56 if @xmath57 , owing to and ) , and integrating over @xmath7 , we get @xmath58 with any nonzero function @xmath59 , which appeared as the ( exponent of ) `` constant '' of integration .",
    "finally , we make @xmath60 in by the transformation @xmath40 with a properly chosen @xmath61 ( thus suppressing the arbitrariness of the parameter @xmath35 down to @xmath62 ) , and obtain the following result .",
    "all solutions of the considered case of , @xmath63 except for solutions with @xmath31 , are determined parametrically by solutions of the nonlinear klein  gordon equation @xmath64 via the relations @xmath65 where @xmath35 serves as the parameter , and @xmath1 is an arbitrary nonzero constant .",
    "if @xmath20 , we have @xmath34 , and we make @xmath66 by a scale transformation of variables , without loss of generality . in this case",
    ", we get @xmath67 from , that is , @xmath68 with any nonzero function @xmath69 , and the equation takes the form @xmath70 consequently , all solutions of the considered case of , @xmath71 except for solutions with @xmath31 , are determined parametrically by solutions of the nonlinear equation with any @xmath72 via the relations",
    "@xmath73 where @xmath35 serves as the parameter .",
    "note that the arbitrariness of @xmath69 in can not be suppressed by the change of parametrization @xmath40 .",
    "integrability of nonlinear klein ",
    "gordon equations is very well studied .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the equation @xmath74 possesses a nontrivial group of higher symmetries if and only if the function @xmath75 satisfies either the condition @xmath76 or the condition @xmath77 where @xmath78 , the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath79 , the constant @xmath80 in is arbitrary , while the constants @xmath80 and @xmath81 in must satisfy the condition @xmath82 no more integrable cases of have been discovered by various methods as yet .    the right - hand side of the nonlinear klein  gordon equation satisfies neither nor .",
    "therefore this equation , together with the corresponding case of the studied equation , must be non - integrable . the right - hand side of the nonlinear klein  gordon equation satisfies or for two values of @xmath1 only , @xmath83 or @xmath66 , when is actually a linear equation , while the corresponding nonlinear equation takes the form or , respectively .",
    "the case of with @xmath83 is the darboux integrable linear equation @xmath84 whose solutions parametrically determine all solutions ( except for solutions with @xmath31 ) of the nonlinear equation via the relations @xmath85 where @xmath35 serves as the parameter . taking the general solution of @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are arbitrary functions , we obtain via the following parametric representation for the general solution of the nonlinear equation : @xmath89 ^ 2 \\ , dt } , \\label{e36}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the prime stands for the derivative .",
    "it follows from that @xmath90 which shows that the general solution does not cover the evident special solutions of with @xmath31 . also , due to",
    ", there are apparently no solutions of without singularities of the type @xmath91 , besides the solutions with @xmath31 .",
    "we do not see how to choose the functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 to make the denominator in not equal zero for all values of @xmath35 and @xmath7 .",
    "the case of with @xmath66 is the fourier integrable linear equation @xmath92 whose solutions parametrically determine all solutions ( except for solutions with @xmath31 ) of the nonlinear equation via the relations @xmath93 where @xmath35 serves as the parameter . since @xmath94",
    "due to , the parametric representation of the general solution of does not cover the evident special solutions of with @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to see from that a solution @xmath42 of contains singularities of the type @xmath91 if the corresponding solution @xmath51 of contains zeroes .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath95 we get from the solution @xmath96 containing singularities , as shown in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath97 ( dashed ) .",
    "[ f1],width=453 ]    on the contrary , taking @xmath98 we get the smooth solution @xmath99 shown in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath97 ( dashed ) .",
    "[ f2],width=453 ]    note that , in and , the constant of integration in @xmath6 has been fixed so that @xmath100 .    it only remains to test the integrability of the nonlinear equation , because the case of with @xmath20 could not be transformed into a klein  gordon equation .",
    "we have found the transformation which relates with the nonlinear equation .",
    "let us study the integrability of by means of the painlev analysis @xcite , which is , in our experience , a reliable and easy - to - use tool to test the integrability of nonlinear equations @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the painlev test for integrability has been empirically verified in numerous studies of multi - parameter families of nonlinear equations , including the fifth - order kdv - type equation @xcite , the coupled kdv equations @xcite , the symmetrically coupled higher - order nonlinear schrdinger equations @xcite , the generalized ito system @xcite , the sixth - order bidirectional wave equation @xcite , and the seventh - order kdv - type equation @xcite .",
    "a hypersurface @xmath101 is non - characteristic for the studied equation if @xmath102 , and we choose @xmath103 without loss of generality , that is , @xmath104 with @xmath105 . using the expansion @xmath106 we find the dominant singular behavior of solutions of near @xmath107 , @xmath108 together with the corresponding positions of resonances , @xmath109 where @xmath110 refers to the arbitrariness of @xmath111 . substituting the expansion @xmath112 to , and collecting terms with equal degrees of @xmath113 , we get the following",
    ". the terms with @xmath114 , of course , give the expression for @xmath115 . the terms with @xmath116",
    "give the expression @xmath117 the terms with @xmath118 , however , do not determine @xmath119 ( here we have the resonance ) but lead to the nontrivial compatibility condition @xmath120 in order to satisfy this condition for all functions @xmath111 ( @xmath105 ) , we must set @xmath121 . otherwise , for @xmath122 , the compatibility condition is not satisfied identically , and we must introduce logarithmic terms to the expansion , starting from the term proportional to @xmath123 , which is a clear indication of non - integrability .",
    "consequently , the nonlinear equation is integrable for @xmath124 only , not for any nonzero function @xmath69 .",
    "therefore the corresponding equation is not integrable . moreover , since @xmath45 , we believe that the only solutions of the nonlinear equation obtainable in a closed form are the evident solutions with @xmath125 .",
    "in this paper , we have generalized further the generalized short pulse equation studied recently in @xcite , and found in this way two new integrable nonlinear wave equations , namely , and , which are transformable to linear klein ",
    "gordon equations . these new equations and , due to the absence of the linear term `` @xmath5 '' in them , can be considered as `` massless '' counterparts of the short pulse equation and the single - cycle pulse equation , respectively .",
    "let us note , however , that the types of integrability of and are essentially different from the type of integrability of and .",
    "while the equations and are two `` avatars '' ( in the sense of transformations ) of the sine - gordon equation , the new nonlinear equation is an `` avatar '' of a darboux integrable linear klein  gordon equation , and the new nonlinear equation is an `` avatar '' of a fourier integrable linear klein  gordon equation . taking this into account , we expect that the integrability properties of the new equation are similar to those of the liouville equation ( continual sets of generalized symmetries and conservation laws , and several mutually non - equivalent lax pairs @xcite ) , whereas the properties of may be similar to those of linear wave equations ( a discrete hierarchy of symmetries , a finite set of conservation laws , and no phase shifts in wave interactions ) .",
    "we believe that these new equations and can be useful , as integrable scalar reductions , for classifications of integrable vector short pulse equations .",
    "let us also note that our equations and did not appear in the most recent integrability classification of generalized short pulse equations of hone , novikov and wang @xcite because equations without the linear term `` @xmath5 '' were not studied there .",
