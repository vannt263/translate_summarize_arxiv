    "in recent years , the heegaard floer theory has fascinated many low - dimensional topologists . developed by p. ozsvth and z. szbo , heegaard floer invariants of closed 3-manifolds led to a breakthrough in low dimensional topology .",
    "these invariants were recently shown to be equivalent to three - dimensional seiberg - witten floer homology , by kutluhan , lee and taubes @xcite .",
    "it was also proven to be equivalent to contact homology by colin , ghiggini and honda @xcite ; this equivalence had initially motivated oszvth ",
    "szab s constructions . moreover , heegaard floer theory turned out to be useful in defining knot and link invariants .",
    "see ozsvth ",
    "szbo @xcite , and rasmussen @xcite .",
    "these invariants are now known as _ knot floer homology _ and _ link floer homology_. in particular , knot floer homology and heegaard floer homology of the 3-manifold obtained by integral surgery on knot turned out to be closely related by rasmussen @xcite and ozsvth  szbo @xcite . for the link surgery case , the relation was discovered but appeared more complicated than the knot case .",
    "see manolescue  ozsvth @xcite .",
    "more recently , lipshitz , ozsvth and thurston extended the theory to 3-manifolds with nonempty boundary .",
    "_ bordered floer homology _ ,",
    "first introduced in  @xcite , consists consists of two different modules : @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the homotopy type of each module is an topological invariant of 3-manifold with _ connected _ boundary equipped with a framing ( a diffeomorphism to a model surface ) .",
    "the bordered theory is a powerful tool thanks to a pairing theorem : one can recover the heegaard floer homology of a closed 3-manifold decomposed into two pieces by taking `` @xmath4 tensor product '' of @xmath3 of the the first piece and @xmath2 of the second piece .",
    "+ bordered floer homology of three manifold with genus one is related to knot floer homology . in (",
    "* chapter 11 ) , they described an algorithm to recover @xmath5 ( with arbitrary framing ) from knot floer homology @xmath6 .",
    "this makes it possible to compute heegaard floer homology of the surgered manifold by taking @xmath4 tensor product with the solid torus .",
    "+ moreover , lipshitz , ozsvth and thurston have generalized bordered floer homology to _ doubly bordered floer homology _ @xcite .",
    "as the name suggests , this is an invariant associated to a 3-manifold with two boundary components ; we get three different types of bimodules , @xmath7 , @xmath0 , and @xmath8 .",
    "an important example of a manifold with 2 boundary components is @xmath9 , a complement of a two - component link @xmath10 .",
    "+ in this paper , we give a calculation of @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is @xmath12-torus link . in  [ sec : prelim ] , we collect the necessary background and notation .",
    "the actual calculation is in  [ sec : main ] ; the answer is shown in  [ fig:26differential ] , with the simplified version in  [ fig : simplified01 ] .",
    "we work with a specific heegaard diagram and find the generators and the differentials explicitly .",
    "however , only a few of the differentials can be obtained by a direct examination of their domains ; for the remaining differentials , we have to exploit the @xmath13 structure of @xmath8 . in section 4 ,",
    "we give several applications of the pairing formula , recovering some known floer homologies from our calculation , to illustrate and check the result .",
    "+ some other calculations of bordered invariants for manifolds with disconnected boundary were recently obtained by jonathan hanselman @xcite .",
    "hanselman computes the @xmath2-type trimodule associated to the trivial @xmath14-bundle over the pair of pants , and uses this , together with certain features of the bordered theory , to recover heegaard floer invariants for all graph manifolds . in principle , our results can also be obtained via hanselman s approach ( although he does not perform this calculation ) ; however , our calculations are based on a more direct examination of the @xmath15 link complement , and thus perhaps more useful for understanding the bordered theory of more general link complements . + *",
