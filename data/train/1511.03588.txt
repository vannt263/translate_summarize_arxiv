    "the sylvester - gallai theorem states that any non - collinear finite set @xmath1 determines an _ ordinary line _ , i.e. , a line with exactly two points from @xmath2 . see @xcite for the history of this theorem . it is natural to ask for the minimum number of ordinary lines determined by a non - collinear point set .",
    "kelly and moser @xcite proved that a non - collinear @xmath1 determines at least @xmath5 ordinary lines , and green and tao @xcite proved that a sufficiently large @xmath2 determines at least @xmath6 ordinary lines , which is the best possible lower bound because of certain constructions on cubic curves ( algebraic curves of degree three ) .",
    "the proof in @xcite in fact gives a stronger _ structural _ statement : any set @xmath2 with a linear number of ordinary lines must have most of its points on a cubic curve ( see section [ sec : ordinarylines ] ) .    we can ask similar questions for other curves instead of lines .",
    "elliott @xcite proved that every finite @xmath1 , not contained in a line or circle , determines at least one _ ordinary circle _ ,",
    "i.e. , a circle containing exactly three points from @xmath2 .",
    "nassajian mojarrad and de zeeuw @xcite used the structural result from @xcite to prove that such an @xmath2 determines at least @xmath7 ordinary circles , which is best possible up to the linear term .",

    ", i.e. , a conic that contains exactly five points of the set , _ and _ is determined by these five points . here",
    "a conic is any zero set of a quadratic polynomial , which may consist of two lines .",
    "note that for conics , unlike for lines or circles , it makes a difference whether one just requires a conic with five points , or one that is also determined by those five points .",
    "indeed , if one takes four points on a line and one point off it , then there are infinitely many conics containing these five points ( namely the line with the four points combined with any line through the other point ) , but they are not determined by the points . similarly , five collinear points lie on infinitely many conics .    the proof in @xcite , although elementary , is rather long and intricate .",
    "devillers and mukhopadhyay @xcite claimed to give a shorter proof , but we think their proof is incorrect ; see remark [ rem : dm ] for an explanation .",
    "recently ( and concurrently with our work ) czapliski et al .",
    "@xcite gave a shorter proof , using some more sophisticated algebraic geometry .",
    "we also give a short proof , as preparation for our main theorem .    in this paper",
    "we prove the following result , making progress on problem 7.2.7 of @xcite .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite set that is not contained in a conic , and that has at most @xmath3 points on a line .",
    "then @xmath2 determines @xmath4 ordinary conics .",
    "it is necessary to put some condition on the maximum number of collinear points in @xmath2 , because of the following construction .",
    "let @xmath2 consist of @xmath9 points on a line @xmath10 and @xmath11 points off @xmath10 .",
    "then an ordinary conic contains at most two points from @xmath10 , so the number of ordinary conics is bounded by @xmath12 . for @xmath13 ,",
    "this quantity is @xmath14 , so the bound in theorem [ thm : main ] would not hold .",
    "the exponent @xmath15 is best possible in this theorem .",
    "this follows from constructions based on group laws on cubic curves , which we will introduce in section [ sec : construction ] .",
    "[ thm : construction ] there exist arbitrarily large finite sets @xmath1 , not contained in a conic and with no four on a line , that determine no more than @xmath16 ordinary conics .",
    "+ there exist arbitrarily large finite sets @xmath1 , not contained in a conic and with at most @xmath6 points on a line , that determine no more than @xmath17 ordinary conics .",
    "the bound in theorem [ thm : main ] depends polynomially on @xmath18 , and it deteriorates as @xmath18 increases . to compare it with the upper bound in theorem [ thm : construction ] , we prove a simplified version of theorem [ thm : main ] in theorem [ thm : generalposition ] ; it states that if no three points of @xmath2 are collinear , and @xmath2 is not contained in a conic , then @xmath2 determines @xmath19 ordinary conics .",
    "thus even in this ideal situation we do not quite have a tight bound .",
    "we are not sure where the truth lies , but finding it probably requires a more refined analysis of the extremal configurations of @xcite and the role that they play in our proof ; this is how the tight bound in @xcite was obtained .    to prove theorem [ thm : main ] , we first give a simplified proof of the existence theorem of wiseman and wilson , which we then modify to prove our bound on the number of ordinary conics .",
    "we initially follow the setup of @xcite , but then we use very different arguments .",
    "the common element is that we use the veronese map from @xmath0 to @xmath20 , defined by @xmath21 for three carefully chosen points @xmath22 , both proofs define a map that sends @xmath23 to a non - collinear set @xmath24 in some plane in @xmath20 . by the sylvester - gallai theorem",
    ", in that plane there is an ordinary line for @xmath24 with two points corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "it is then shown that @xmath26 determine an ordinary conic . in @xcite , the map to the plane",
    "consists of three successive central projections from the points @xmath27 , and most of their proof is spent analyzing the interactions between these three projections .",
    "we , instead , use a single `` hyperprojection '' from the plane spanned by @xmath27 , which allows us to see the properties of the map more clearly .",
    "this leads to a shorter and simpler proof , that , moreover , can be extended to a proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "we also note that wiseman and wilson rely on a result of motzkin @xcite regarding planes in @xmath28 , which our proof does not .",
    "czapliski et al .",
    "@xcite use a different map in a similar way , namely the _ cremona transformation _ based at three non - collinear @xmath29 .",
    ", then the cremona transformation is given by @xmath30 in projective coordinates .",
    "] this map has very similar properties to the combination of veronese map and projections that are used in @xcite and in our proof ; we suspect that in some sense these maps are the same .",
    "another difference is that the proof in @xcite uses hirzebruch s inequality ( which has only been proved using heavy tools ) , while @xcite and we use the simple melchior s inequality .",
    "a common feature of the proofs in @xcite is that the points @xmath22 have to be chosen so that two of their spanned lines are ordinary .",
    "this is an obstacle to obtaining many ordinary conics , because there need not be many such triples in @xmath2 . in our existence proof , we also use such a triple for convenience , but our proof is flexible enough that we can do without this property .",
    "thus , in our proof of theorem [ thm : main ] , we follow the outline above for every non - collinear triple @xmath22 .",
    "if there are not too many points on a line , we can obtain @xmath31 such triples , and thanks to the green - tao theorem , we will each time find @xmath32 ordinary conics .",
    "hence the @xmath33 .    we can not help but mention one related conjecture . in @xcite , it was asked whether similar statements hold for curves of higher degree : given a degree @xmath34 , if a finite @xmath1 does not lie on a curve of degree @xmath34 , does @xmath2 determine an _ ordinary curve _ of degree @xmath34 , i.e. , a curve containing exactly @xmath35 points of @xmath2 ( and perhaps also determined by those points ) ?",
    "in this section we collect several facts about ordinary lines , which we will use in our main proofs .",
    "we include some further discussion , because we think that these lemmas raise some interesting questions about ordinary lines that are not completely solved .",
    "[ lem : twolines ] if @xmath1 is finite and not collinear , then there exists a point @xmath36 that is contained in two lines , each with exactly two or three points of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the total number of lines determined by @xmath2 , and @xmath38 the number of lines containing exactly @xmath11 points of @xmath2 .",
    "melchior s inequality @xcite ( also used in @xcite ) states that @xmath39 , which gives us @xmath40 since @xmath2 is not collinear , we have @xmath41 ( by the de bruijn - erds theorem @xcite ) , so @xmath42 this implies that there is at least one point @xmath36 lying on two lines , each of which contains two or three points of @xmath2 .",
    "there are point sets in which no point lies on two ordinary lines , namely the sets @xmath43 described by green and tao @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from their proof that , for large point sets , the sets @xmath43 are the only sets with this property ( up to projective equivalence ) . indeed , either @xmath2 has more than @xmath6 ordinary lines and then trivially two pass through the same point ; or else @xmath2 must be equivalent to one of the sets @xmath44 , and by inspection only those of the form @xmath43 do not have a point on two ordinary lines .    it is thus also not true that there must always be a triple of points in @xmath2 such that all three lines spanned by the triple are ordinary ( an _ ordinary triangle _ ) .",
    "clearly this fails if @xmath2 is equivalent to @xmath45 , or if @xmath2 is contained in two lines , but even if one excludes these specific types of sets , there need not be an ordinary triangle .",
    "indeed , choose any @xmath11 points and a disjoint line @xmath10 , and for every line spanned by the @xmath11 points , add its intersection point with @xmath10 to the point set .",
    "then any triple of points must have a pair from the @xmath11 points or from @xmath10 that would not span an ordinary line .",
    "it is unfortunate that there need not be an ordinary triangle , because that would have made it much easier to prove the existence of an ordinary conic ( see the proof of theorem [ thm : generalposition ] ) .",
    "erds @xcite wrote that he `` thought for a moment '' that if @xmath2 has no four on a line , then @xmath2 must have an ordinary triangle ; the constructions above would certainly be excluded . however , as erds pointed out , fredi and palsti ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) gave a construction ( based on a construction of burr , grnbaum , and sloane @xcite ) for which this fails ; this construction is related to the cubic curve constructions in @xcite .",
    "another weakened version that one could ask is the following : if the point set is not covered by two lines , must there be a triple such that all three spanned lines have at most three points ? in @xcite , the szemerdi - trotter theorem was used to prove that there is a constant @xmath46 such that any @xmath47 , not covered by @xmath46 lines , has a triple of points with all three lines containing at most @xmath46 points .",
    "the following lemma tells us when we can find an ordinary line for @xmath2 that avoids some fixed point @xmath48 , which may or may not be in @xmath2 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is _ near - collinear _ if all the points of @xmath2 but one lie on a line .",
    "[ lem : avoid ] if @xmath49 is not near - collinear or collinear , then for every point @xmath48 of the plane , one can find an ordinary line for @xmath2 that avoids @xmath48 .",
    "assume that @xmath2 is not near - collinear or collinear , and that every ordinary line of @xmath2 passes through @xmath48 .",
    "we note that the following proof works whether @xmath48 is in @xmath2 or not .    by the theorem of kelly and",
    "moser @xcite mentioned in the introduction , the set @xmath50 determines at least @xmath5 ordinary lines .",
    "each of these lines must pass through @xmath48 , and each contains one other point .",
    "let @xmath51 be the set of these other points , so @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath2 is not near - collinear or collinear , @xmath53 is not collinear , so by another application of the kelly - moser theorem , the set @xmath53 determines at least @xmath54 ordinary lines . again",
    "each line must pass through @xmath48 , but now each contains two points of @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath55 be the set of these other points , so @xmath56 .",
    "the sets @xmath51 and @xmath55 are disjoint , and together they contain @xmath57 points , which is more than @xmath58 when @xmath59 .",
    "we think it would be interesting to see a direct proof of lemma [ lem : avoid ] , not using the result of kelly and moser .",
    "one could also ask for the minimum number of ordinary lines that avoid @xmath48 , or ask for an ordinary line that avoids several points .",
    "these questions can be answered using the results of green and tao , but this only holds for sufficiently large point sets . in lemma",
    "[ lem : avoidset ] we prove that , for sufficiently large sets , there are many ordinary lines avoiding any number of fixed points .",
    "this lemma will be crucial in the proof of our bound on the number of ordinary conics .",
