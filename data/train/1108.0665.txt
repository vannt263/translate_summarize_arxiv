    "much attention in recent years has been focussed on eternal inflation @xcite , for at least two good reasons .",
    "the first is that almost all inflationary models seem to lead to eternal inflation .",
    "it is possible to design models of inflation that are not eternal , but at least to many of us , such models look contrived . while the word `` generic '' is not really well - defined in this context , it nonetheless seems that inflation generically becomes eternal .",
    "the second reason stems from the observed fact that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite , a fact which is explained most simply by assuming a nonzero cosmological constant , or vacuum energy density .",
    "but the required value of the cosmological constant is then more than 120 orders of magnitude less than the planck scale , a fact which is very hard to explain . for many of us ,",
    "the most plausible explanation currently known is the proposal , advanced by weinberg in 1987 , that the value of the cosmological constant is governed by a selection effect @xcite .",
    "if the idea of a string theory landscape of vacua @xcite is combined with the assumption that eternal inflation produces an infinite number of pocket universes which populate all or at least many of these vacua , then the selection - effect argument is given a logical setting : the many vacua of the landscape all have different vacuum energy densities , with a large number ( although a tiny fraction ) expected to be consistent with the observed value . if life forms preferentially in pocket universes with very small values of the vacuum energy density , then the smallness of the observed cosmological constant is explained",
    ". almost all life in the multiverse would observe a very small value of the cosmological constant .",
    "once eternal inflation is taken as a serious possibility , an important question arises : how does one define probabilities in an eternally inflating multiverse ? in an",
    "eternally inflating multiverse , anything that can happen will happen , an infinite number of times .",
    "furthermore , in a world described by quantum theory , almost anything can happen .",
    "we normally think that physical theories can give meaningful predictions because , on the macroscopic level , some classes of outcomes are much more probable than others . but in a multiverse theory all these outcomes will happen an infinite number of times , so a physical theory can make useful predictions only if one can distinguish between common events and very rare ones .",
    "but to say that one type of event is more probable than another , one has to compare infinities .",
    "comparing infinities is not in general a well - defined operation , so one needs to introduce some prescription for regularizing the infinities .",
    "such a prescription is called a measure . with a measure to regularize the infinities",
    ", it would be possible to say that one sequence of events happens twice as often as some other sequence , and is therefore twice as probable . without a measure , a theory could give no information other than to distinguish possible events from events which are totally impossible .",
    "global time cutoff measures , especially the scale - factor cutoff measure @xcite , appear to be promising and have recently received much attention .",
    "the detailed definition of a global time cutoff measure will be given in the next section .",
    "global time cutoff measures can be constructed for a variety of different time variables , and the consequences of the measure can depend in a very crucial way on the choice of time variable .",
    "nonetheless , the discussion here will focus only on qualitative issues which are common to all global time cutoff measures , so we will not need to specify what time variable is being used .    in a recent paper by bousso , freivogel , leichenauer , and rosenhaus @xcite , which we will refer to as bflr , a point of view",
    "is described in which the final time cutoff is interpreted as an absolute cutoff , the literal end of time .",
    "the possibility of hitting the cutoff is described as a `` novel type of catastrophe . '' as they put it , `` we argue that cutoff observers are a real possibility , because _ there is no well - defined probability distribution without the cutoff ; in particular , only the cutoff defines the set of allowed events . _ '' we will refer to this description as the absolute cutoff interpretation .    in this paper we will present an alternative point of view , which we will refer to as the mathematical limit interpretation . in this formulation",
    "the multiverse goes on forever with no end of time , and the cutoff serves only as a mathematical device for defining probabilities .",
    "the cutoff literally disappears once the limit @xmath0 is taken .",
    "we will of course not argue that this type of measure is necessarily correct .",
    "we do not claim to know the correct answer to the measure question , and so far as we know , nobody else does either .",
    "furthermore , one is always free to assume that time will end if one wants to , so we will not try to argue that this is not possible .",
    "however , we will argue that global time cutoff measures are logically consistent , and that they are perfectly compatible with time continuing without limit . eternal inflation , with a global time cutoff measure ,",
    "does not require an end of time .    in sec .",
    "ii we will describe the definition of a global time cutoff measure , starting with a fairly detailed description of how one can define an infinite lattice model of the multiverse .",
    "an important feature of the mathematical limit interpretation is that even though the multiverse is infinite , it can still be given a mathematical definition that makes it in principle as well - defined as the set of positive integers .",
    "the measure is needed to count events that occur in the multiverse , but the multiverse itself can be constructed without a measure . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss some peculiar properties of global time cutoff measures : the youngness bias , the fact that a nonzero fraction of all observers reach the cutoff ( even as it is taken to infinity ) , and a probability paradox that focuses on an experiment in which the results of a coin flip are announced with differing time delays , depending on the outcome .",
    "the absolute cutoff interpretation gives a straightforward resolution of this paradox , but it is much more subtle in the mathematical limit interpretation . before discussing the resolution , in sec .",
    "iv we review some mathematical properties of probabilities defined on infinite sets .",
    "we return to the probability paradox in sec .",
    "v , showing that it can be resolved by recognizing a counter - intuitive feature of global time cutoff measures : time - delay bias .",
    "that is , if the outcome of an experiment is reported with a time delay that depends on the outcome , then the observation of the reports will be biased in favor of the shorter time delay .",
    "we go on to discuss betting on the paradoxical experiment , which we treat as a consistency test of our understanding of the probabilities .",
    "we discuss in particular the possibility of bets for which the time of the payoff depends upon the outcome .",
    "the time - delay bias suggests that maybe one can actually influence the results of an experiment by introducing an outcome - dependent time delay , so we discuss this issue in sec .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "vii . in an appendix",
    ", we attempt to show that the time - delay bias can be understood in terms of the cloning  i.e. , the appearance of an exponentially growing set of copies of any experiment  that is a distinctive feature of eternal inflation .",
    "the first step in this mathematical limit interpretation is to recognize that the entire , infinite multiverse can be constructed ( mathematically ) _ before _ the probability measure is even mentioned . but",
    "how can one imagine `` constructing '' an infinite system ?",
    "the method is essentially the same as the one that has been used by mathematicians since the 1800 s . in 1889",
    "giuseppi peano published the famous set of axioms that are now traditionally taken as the basis for the positive integers @xcite .",
    "the infinite system is constructed by postulating that the number one ( or perhaps zero ) exists , and that each natural number has a successor .",
    "a few other axioms are introduced to assure that each application of the successor function produces a number that is unequal to all previous numbers , and the infinite set is constructed .",
    "it is worth noting that infinite sets , such as the set of positive integers , are _ not _ constructed as the limit of finite sets . while at first it might look sensible to define the set of all integers as the set of integers from 1 to @xmath1 , in the limit as @xmath2 , a little thought shows that this is not consistent with the usual concept of a limit .",
    "consider , for example , the concept of a limit in the context of a real - valued function @xmath3 of a real number @xmath4 .",
    "the limit _",
    "x x_0 f(x ) = a [ eq : limit ] is defined to be true if and only if for every real @xmath5 there exists a real @xmath6 such that @xmath7 implies that @xmath8 .",
    "the crucial point is that @xmath3 can be said to approach @xmath9 only if the distance between @xmath3 and @xmath9 can become arbitrarily small as @xmath4 becomes closer and closer to @xmath10 .",
    "but if we try to apply the same notion to sets , we see that the logic does not carry over , since there is no sense in which the distance between a finite set and an infinite set is ever small .",
    "the set of integers from 1 to @xmath1 is always infinitely different from the set of all integers , so it does not approach the set of all integers as @xmath1 approaches infinity .",
    "thus , infinite sets are not constructed as limits , but rather by giving a rule , such as the peano successor axiom , that determines the elements of the set .",
    "so , just as the infinite set of positive integers is constructed by assuming the successor rule of the peano axioms , a model of the infinite multiverse can be constructed by its update rule , which is determined by the model of evolution embodied in the laws of physics . for purposes of discussing the measure",
    "we pretend that the laws of physics are known , so that we can focus on the problem of how probabilities are defined .",
    "to think concretely , we will also assume that these laws of physics can be well - approximated on a discrete lattice , where we will refer to each lattice site as a pixel .",
    "the choice of time variable is a crucially important element of any lattice simulation , but here we are not aiming for efficiency .",
    "we are merely trying to give a simple description of how such a simulation can in principle be carried out .",
    "for this purpose we can imagine using proper time @xmath11 .",
    "the 3-volume @xmath12 of the multiverse is expected to grow exponentially at late times , with some rate that we will call @xmath13 .",
    "that is , v_multiverse(t ) e^t  .",
    "[ eq : volume ] ( one might imagine a multiverse that is infinite in volume at all times , but it suffices for our purposes to consider a multiverse model that is finite at any given time , but which continues to grow for an infinite time .",
    "this provides an infinite spacetime volume that can be sampled to define probabilities . )",
    "we believe that this formula for the volume is exact in the limit of large @xmath11 , depending only on the assumption that the late - time evolution becomes self - similar .",
    "that is , at asymptotically late times we can think of the multiverse as a huge number of cosmic regions , each including a huge number of pocket universes .",
    "each of these regions is statistically identical to the others and evolves independently of the others .",
    "since we can choose these regions as large as we like , we can presumably arrange for statistical fluctuations to be as small as we like .",
    "thus , in the amount of time @xmath14 in which one region enlarges by a factor of @xmath15 , so will all the other regions . and in the next increment @xmath16 of time , all regions will again enlarge by a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "sites , for some very large @xmath17 ( say @xmath18 googol ) .",
    "suppose further that it can be divided into @xmath19 cubic regions , each of size @xmath20 pixels , and each containing a huge number of pocket universes . by the homogeneity of the construction",
    ", any two of these regions would be statistically identical , so the expectation value of any quantity should be the same for the two regions .",
    "furthermore , the statistical fluctuations of any quantity , when expressed as a fraction of the mean , will appoach zero as @xmath21 .",
    "we can imagine calculating the expansion factor of each region during the next time step @xmath22 , and the expectation values for the two regions should be equal , with the fluctuations arbitrarily small as @xmath21 .",
    "now consider the state of the lattice at a much later time , focusing on any cubic region of the lattice with the same physical size , in the sense that the expectation value for its 3-volume matches that of the original regions .",
    "our assumption of self - similarity includes the assumption that any such region should also be statistically identical to the original regions , and therefore should have the same expectation value for the expansion factor during the next time interval @xmath22 , again with arbitrarily small fluctuations .",
    "note that all these expecation values are well - defined before we introduce a measure , since they are defined by the probabilities for fields at specific lattice sites . under these assumptions ,",
    "the expansion factor for the time interval @xmath22 can be converted into an exponential expansion rate @xmath13 , which describes the expansion of the entire multiverse . ]    to describe the exponentially expanding multiverse on the lattice , we can imagine that the number of pixels at a given value of the time coordinate increases exponentially with the time , so the average lattice spacing does not change with time .",
    "more precisely , to describe an eternally inflating multiverse with late time exponential growth of 3-volume given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : volume ] ) , we can introduce a doubling of the lattice points in each direction whenever the total 3-volume increases by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "then the series of mesh refinement times would be given by an arithmetic series @xmath24 with the total number of lattice points increasing by a factor of 8 at each coordinate time listed in the series .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pixelated ]        ) .",
    "we will not need to fully describe the details of this model , but will assume that the multiverse can be described by specifying the values of some number of fields , including the metric and various particle fields , at each lattice site . for simplicity , we assume that even the set of possible field values can be discretized on some fine mesh .",
    "we want to focus on the treatment of the infinite spacetime volume and the infinite number of events that will result , so we try to simplify the local description of the physics as much as possible . as long as the discretizations of the spacetime lattice and the values of the fields",
    "are chosen on a very fine mesh , we assume that the local laws of physics can be approximated to as high an accuracy as we wish . in any case , we assume that the discretization of the local laws of physics does not affect the fundamental issues that arise from the infinite spacetime volume .    a model of the multiverse can then be constructed by starting with some finite - sized initial state , defined on a finite number of pixels , and letting the system evolve . at each step of the ( discretized ) evolution ,",
    "the update rule will define the joint probability for every possible set of pixel values in terms of the probabilities that were known for the previous time step .",
    "we assume that general coordinate invariance and any gauge symmetries of the fields can be handled by some gauge - fixing procedure , so the evolution becomes uniquely defined .",
    "we further assume that even processes like bubble nucleation can be described on the lattice if the lattice spacing is small enough , and that higher - dimensional physics with compactification could be simulated on a lattice if necessary .",
    "to allow for final singularities in black holes and in negative - cosmological - constant bubbles , the field values of a pixel should include the option of the pixel being nonexistent . in any case , once the update rule is specified , the multiverse model is fully constructed , and is just as mathematically well - defined as the set of positive integers .",
    "note that the probabilities for the pixelated multiverse are calculated directly from the assumptions about the initial conditions and the rules of evolution .",
    "the measure is needed to count events within the multiverse , but the description of the multiverse itself does not require a measure .    note that if we attempted to implement these update rules on a computer , we would only be able to proceed for some finite number of steps before the simulation exceeded the size of the computer .",
    "but we view this as a practical problem , not a problem in principle .",
    "if we programmed a computer to list the integers , there would also be a limit , at which point the computer would run out of registers .",
    "but the limitations of a computer are never interpreted as implying an end to the integers .",
    "the set of integers is mathematically well - defined , and infinite .",
    "similarly , the model of the multiverse would be well - defined , and infinite , even if any specific computer is limited to describing a finite piece of it .    in this mathematical limit interpretation",
    ", we see that it is not true that the cutoff defines the set of allowed events , as was assumed in the absolute cutoff interpretation .",
    "rather the full , infinite set of events is constructed as a mathematical object before the cutoff is even mentioned .",
    "it is the laws of physics , or our best approximation of them , that defines the set of allowed events .",
    "once the mathematical model of the multiverse has been constructed , a measure can be introduced to define the relative abundance of different kinds of events .",
    "we are working in the semiclassical approximation , so we describe the spacetime classically , with a stochastic evolution that reflects the underlying quantum dynamics .",
    "the construction starts by making an arbitrary choice of an initial , finite , spacelike slice , which is described as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a time variable used in the definition of the measure .",
    "it could be the same proper time variable @xmath11 that was used in the lattice simulation , but it could also be scale - factor time or some other time variable .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : measure2 ]        ) .",
    "one then constructs a family of timelike geodesics , each normal to the initial surface , projecting them into the future .",
    "the time variable @xmath26 is measured along each geodesic , with a definition determined by the choice of time variable .",
    "the worldlines are each followed until they reach an arbitrary final time cutoff @xmath27 .",
    "the region swept out by these worldlines , between @xmath25 and @xmath27 , becomes the sample spacetime region .",
    "there is a minor complication if the construction does not encounter a region of eternal inflation , which can happen for some choices of the initial ( finite ) spacelike slice .",
    "if that happens , the recipe requires that a new spacelike slice is chosen , and the construction starts again .",
    "once a region of eternal inflation is found , however , the sample spacetime region will approach infinite spacetime volume as @xmath0 . the relative abundance of any two types of events @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "is then defined as the ratio of the numbers of these events in the sample spacetime region , @xmath30 , in the limit as @xmath31 approaches infinity .",
    "the limit is expected to be independent of the choice of initial surface , and in this measure it defines the relative abundance and the relative probability of these events : _ _ c n_a n_b  . [ eq : events ]    in the paragraph above we talked about `` types of events , '' without clarifying what exactly we meant .",
    "the phrase `` type of event '' should mean a class of events that is described with well - defined tolerances , so that if anybody looked at what was happening in a region of spacetime , she could decide without ambiguity whether an event of this class has taken place .",
    "examples of `` types of events '' would include the birth of normal observers , the nucleation of boltzmann brains that are smart enough to simulate normal observers for at least a second ( assuming that `` normal observer '' has been suitably defined ) , the decays of protons , etc .",
    "in addition to events , which are occurrences that can be approximated as points in spacetime , we may also want to consider long - term projects , like a 10-year - long proton decay experiment .",
    "for the proton decay experiment , one can talk about the pushing of the upload button that sends the final paper to the arxiv  which is well - approximated as a point - like event  but one might want to also talk about probabilities for the full experiment .",
    "if we look only at the pushing of upload buttons , we would be counting bad experiments and possibly even fraudulent experiments , while if we include the full experiment in our description , we could in principle devise a definition that excludes such things .",
    "we will call such extended items `` stories '' .",
    "so , a type of story would be defined as a description of a finite - sized region of spacetime that is specified with well - defined tolerances , so that if anybody looked at what was happening in a region of spacetime , she could decide without ambiguity whether or not this story occurs in the region . in the global time cutoff measure ,",
    "the relative probabilities of any two types of stories @xmath28 and @xmath29 are again given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : events ] ) , where now @xmath28 and @xmath29 are generalized to refer to types of stories . we will consider an event to be a special ( point - like ) case of a story , so eq .  ( [ eq : events ] ) covers all cases .    to give a precise definition of a story in the context of the lattice model , we begin by defining a microstory as a story with a complete description of a region where the microstory is constructed . in general the region does not have to be simply connected nor connected , but it does have to be finite .",
    "an example of a microstory is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : microstory ]        in the context of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional pixelated multiverse .",
    "the figure contains only three occurrences of the same microstory encircled by red lines , but , of course , in an infinite multiverse each microstory , which is not forbidden by laws of physics , would occur an infinite number of times . to describe a given microstory",
    "precisely we can start by first defining its origin , and then we can list the relative coordinates of all of its pixels with their exact values . the origin of a story can be defined by identifying all of its pixels with the smallest @xmath26 , out of which one can identify all of the pixels with the smallest @xmath4 , and so on for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which will always give a unique pixel . then for the particular example of fig.[fig : microstory ] , the microstory @xmath34 is defined by the set of relative coordinates and pixel values : m \\{(0 , 0 ; 3 ) , ( 0,1;7 ) , ( 0 , 2 ; 9 ) , ( 1 , 2 ; 1 ) , ( 2,1;1),(2,2;5 ) , ( 3,2;2 ) } .",
    "if the microstory overlaps one or more mesh refinements , then the microstory description must specify the times at which they happen ; after a mesh refinement the spatial coordinates are allowed to have half - integral values , with further subdivisions if there are more mesh refinements .    for a given realization of the multiverse lattice",
    ", a microstory is said to match at a given lattice site if all the pixels in @xmath34 match when the origin of @xmath34 is assigned to the lattice site .",
    "( in matching , the pixel specification @xmath35 is always compared with the pixel one to the right of the origin , even if the mesh - refined coordinate increment on the lattice is 1/2 , 1/4 , or anything else . )",
    "the match is in the sample spacetime region if all of its pixels are",
    ". we can let @xmath36 denote the number of matches for the microstory @xmath34 in the sample spacetime region .",
    "a story @xmath37 is then defined as a finite set of distinct microstories s = \\{m_1 , m_2 ,  ,",
    "[ eq : storydef ] any such set can be called a story , but we will mainly be interested in stories that correspond to a macroscopic description , such as a coin toss landing heads . ideally the set @xmath38 can be constructed so that every situation that would macroscopically be described as a coin toss landing heads would match one and only one microstory in the set .",
    "it would not be easy to construct such a set , but we assume that it can be done . in many cases",
    "the macroscopic description might not specify an orientation , so the set of microstories would have to include approximations to spatially rotated states , even though the lattice breaks rotational symmetry microscopically .",
    "time translations are also complicated , because the set of microstories should include all possible ways that the macroscopic version of the story can be cut by mesh refinements , and all possible combinations of pixel sizes and metric values .",
    "as long as we are convinced that this can be done , however , we do not need to think about the details .",

    "nonetheless the youngness bias applies in principle to the scale - factor cutoff measure , so the conceptual issues that the youngness bias raises are relevant for questions of interpretation and logical consistency , although quantitatively the effects would be undetectable .",
    "the exponential expansion also leads to a peculiar result concerning the distribution of observers . for any given value of the cutoff time @xmath31 , a nonzero fraction of all observers who have ever lived",

    "the calculated probabilities then depend only on the multiverse at times @xmath57 , and times later than @xmath58 are meaningless . in the mathematical limit interpretation , it is really the opposite .",

    "we will also assume for simplicity that @xmath70 has the same value everywhere in the multiverse .",
    "the thought experiment becomes a paradox when we imagine that a subject wakes up , with no information about how long he slept , and is asked the probability that he is the designated head subject , who had slept for one minute .",
    "the intuitive answer would be 50% , since it was determined by the flip of a fair coin , but this is not what the global time cutoff measure gives ( see fig .",

    "the exponential expansion implies that there are @xmath70 times as many awakenings from short naps , so the probability of being the head subject is not 50% , but instead @xmath72 , which can be very close to 1 .",
    "thus , according to the global time cutoff measure , the probability of the outcome of the coin flip is no longer 50/50 when the subject awakes , but instead it has become more probable that the outcome was the one that led to the one - minute nap .",
    "if we imagine @xmath71 , then when the subject wakes up he can be almost certain that he is waking from a short nap .    to make things sound even more bizarre ,",
    "suppose that when the subject wakes up he is not told the outcome of the coin or the length of his nap .",
    "suppose instead he goes back to sleep , this time being told that he will be awakened at 60+@xmath73 minutes after the original coin toss , regardless of the outcome . when he awakes , he is again asked what is the probability that his original nap was the short one .",
    "now , according to the global time cutoff measure , we count all events in which the subject wakes up for the second time , which is always 60+@xmath73 minutes from the start . this time there is no bias imposed by the measure . even though the subject was almost sure when he woke up the first time that he was awakening from a short nap , now he concludes that the probability is 50% , as he had thought immediately after the coin flip .",
    "these results seem strange , but bflr point out that they are perfectly understandable if we interpret the cutoff as a physical end of time . in that case ,",
    "when the subject goes to sleep , he has no guarantee that he will wake up .",
    "perhaps the end of time will occur while he is asleep , and then it is all over .",
    "thus he learns something clearly new when he awakes : he learns that time has not ended yet .",
    "this is more likely to be the case if he is awakening from a one - minute nap than if he is awakening from an hour nap , so the enhanced probability of the short nap is implied by a straightforward conditional probability calculation .",
    "if he goes to sleep for a second time and is awakened at 60+@xmath73 minutes from the start , he has to recalculate the conditional probabilities .",
    "now he knows that it is 60+@xmath73 minutes after the coin flip and time has not ended , but the probability for that is independent of the outcome of the coin flip .",

    "these subjects outnumber their counterparts from the earlier time by a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "from the point of view of the subject , however , these results may seem rather surprising .",

    "he would describe the change in the probability , between the bet of the 2nd type and the bet of the third type , as the result of the time delay bias that we discussed in the previous subsection . whether the subject is required to declare his bet before he goes to sleep , or whether he is put back to sleep after waking up the first time",
    ", there is a differential time delay between the two bets .",
    "if he is the head subject , the third type of bet occurs 59 minutes after the 2nd type of bet .",

    "if the subject has become accustomed to the time - delay bias , he would understand how bets of the 2nd type are consistent with bets of the third type .",
    "we consider now the point of view of the experimenter .",

    "the bet is to be paid off when rosencrantz wakes up . knowing the @xmath88 odds according to the global time cutoff measure",
    ", rosencrantz proposes that he would pay the experimenter $ 1 if he turns out to be the head subject , but the experimenter should pay him $ @xmath70 if he turns out to be the tail subject . from rosencrantz",
    "s point of view , this is certainly a break - even bet , given the global time cutoff measure . but",
    "how does the experimenter view it ?    if it is a break - even bet for rosencrantz , it must be a break - even bet for the experimenter , too , as calculated by global time cutoff measure expectation values .",
    "the expectation value is calculated , after all , by simply counting transactions in the sample spacetime region . in each transaction , any gain for rosencrantz is a loss for the experimenter , and vice versa .",
    "if the transactions average to zero for rosencrantz , then of course they must also average to zero for the experimenter .",
    "but to the experimenter , there is a 50% chance that rosencrantz will be the head subject , in which case the experimenter will receive $ 1 at 1 minute after the coin flip .",
    "there is a 50% chance that rosencrantz will be the tail subject , in which case the experimenter will have to pay $ @xmath70 at 1 hour after the coin flip .",
    "how is this breaking even ?",
    "if one looks at the rosencrantz / experimenter transactions in the sample spacetime region , one sees that there are @xmath70 times as many $ 1 payments from rosencrantz to experimenter as there are $ @xmath70 payments from experimenter to rosencrantz ; the former happen at a time that is earlier by 59 minutes , so @xmath70 times as many fit under the cutoff .",
    "thus , as an expectation value calculated in the global time cutoff measure , the experimenter does break even .",
    "the experimenter has a 50% chance of winning $ 1 at 1 minute , and a 50% chance of losing $ @xmath70 at 1 hour , but in the youth - biased multiverse there are @xmath70 times more experimenters at 1 minute as there are at 1 hour .    from the experimenter s own perspective , having the opportunity to win $ 1 at 1 minute or lose $ @xmath70 at 1 hour , each with 50% probability , may or may not sound attractive .",
    "she may have her own preferences about how desirable it is to have money sooner rather than later .",
    "if , however , there is a freely available banking system that lets her exchange money at some fixed interest rate , then she can evaluate this bet independently of her personal preferences for having money sooner vs.  later .",
    "suppose , for example , that accrued interest for 59 minutes increases the value of a deposit by a factor @xmath93 .",
    "then the experimenter can settle the bet at 1 minute , if she chooses , by collecting the $ 1 if she wins , or depositing $ @xmath94 if she loses , so the bank account could pay the debt at the end of the hour . alternatively ,",
    "if she prefers to settle the bet at 1 hour , she can deposit the $ 1 at one minute if she wins , and then at 1 hour she would either obtain $ @xmath93 from the bank , or pay $ @xmath70 to rosencrantz .",
    "thus , for either of these choices , she would view this as breaking even if @xmath95 .",
    "this can be seen to be a general theorem :    * _ multi - payoff - time betting theorem : _ if a bet involves payoffs at a time that depends on the outcome , the break - even point for the global time cutoff measure can be found by assuming that the interest rate is equal to the multiversal expansion rate .",
    "the above theorem serves to clarify an important point concerning experiments and the probabilities for their outcomes . when we specified the probability of the outcome of an experiment in eq .",
    "( [ eq : expt ] ) , we did not require that the different outcomes all end at the same time .",
    "the probabilities are defined by counting the number of stories under the cutoff , so stories that end earlier are favored .",
    "suppose that we wish to bet on such an experiment , and we want to understand what the probabilities of eq .",
    "( [ eq : expt ] ) are telling us about how to find the break - even odds . to use these probabilities directly",
    ", we have to assume that the payoff that would result for a particular outcome @xmath45 would occur exactly when @xmath45 ends , so that the frequency of the payoff ( counted in the sample spacetime region ) would match the frequency of the experimental result .",
    "if the payoff came earlier or later , its frequency in the sample spacetime region would be different .",
    "so , when the experimenter thinks about his prospective bet with rosencrantz , he can view the experiment in either of two ways , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expt ] .        we will call the losing outcome @xmath96 , where rosencrantz wakes up after 1 hour , terminating the experiment . but the winning outcome could reasonably be described in either of two ways . in the first , which we will call @xmath97",
    ", rosencrantz wakes up at 1 minute , and the experiment ends . in the second , which we will call @xmath98 , rosencrantz also wakes up at one minute , but in this version the experiment is not considered over until one hour from the coin flip .",
    "thus , @xmath97 ends at 1 minute , while @xmath96 and @xmath98 end at one hour .",
    "since an experiment is described in eq .",

    "the experimenter will agree that these are the break - even bets in both cases , according to the global time cutoff measure , and the two bets can be seen to be equivalent to each other by assuming that the interest rate is equal to the multiversal expansion rate .    the relevance of an interest rate equal to the multiversal expansion rate is perhaps made clearer by considering a fictional multiversal bank . the multiversal bank will freely lend money or accept deposits with an interest rate equal to the multiversal expansion rate .",
    "all transactions are assumed to be instantaneous in the global time coordinate @xmath26 that is used to define the cutoff .",
    "while such a bank is clearly impossible , it is nonetheless interesting that , if such a bank did exist , it would break even according to the global time cutoff measure .",

    ", deposits of this type might total $ x. one year later these depositors will come back and collect @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the expansion factor of the multiverse over one year , @xmath104 .",
    "but the universal exponential growth of the multiverse ensures that on the same day , deposits to the one - year certificate accounts will be @xmath103 times larger than the previous year , and hence @xmath105 , so the bank breaks even . on earth this",
    "would be called a ponzi scheme , but it is sound practice for a fictional multiversal bank .",
    "money lending with an interest rate equal to the expansion rate will always break even in the global time cutoff measure .    finally , we point out that the use of the global time cutoff measure does not in any way restrict the betting preferences that a person could choose . in the g - v",
    "thought experiment , while everyone should agree that the global time cutoff measure implies that the break - even odds for the experiment @xmath47 are @xmath88 , everyone is also allowed to have his own betting preferences .",
    "betting preferences and the calculation of probabilities are two independent issues .",
    "for example , rosencrantz might be convinced that the global cutoff measure is correct , but his primary concern might not be the expectation value for the money exchange immediately after he wakes up .",
    "he might instead be saving to pay his rent , which might be due 60 minutes after the start of the experiment .",
    "since he is interested in making predictions for the time when his rent is due , he would calculate the probabilities for experiment @xmath106 , which ends at the relevant time .",
    "the probability is then 50/50 .",
    "since the payoff is nonetheless scheduled to take place at 1 minute if he is the head subject , he will need to use an interest rate to convert this probability into a statement about break - even odds .",
    "if he knows that the actual interest rate available to him would increase the value of a deposit by a factor $ @xmath107 over 59 minutes , he would conclude that to break even by his personally preferred criterion , the odds should be @xmath108 in favor of heads .",
    "for the special case @xmath95 this would be identical to experiment @xmath99 , but otherwise they are different .",
    "but for any preference and for any available interest rate , the global time cutoff measure can be used to calculate the relevant expectation values so that rosencrantz can decide how to bet . for the example discussed in this paragraph",
    ", the result is the same as what we would calculate without knowing anything about the multiverse .",
    "since the g - v thought experiment leads to @xmath88 odds in favor of the shorter nap , is it possible to use this effect to select where we would like to live in the multiverse ?",

    "bflr concluded their paper by stating that the deduction that time can end can be avoided only by rejecting at least one of three propositions :    * probabilities in a finite universe are given by relative frequencies of events or histories . *",
    "probabilities in an infinite universe are defined by a geometric cutoff . *",
    "the universe is eternally inflating .",
    "we believe that there is a fourth possibility , which these authors have passed over : there is a mathematically well - defined way of defining probabilities without imposing an end of time , which can be adopted without rejecting any of the three statements above . in this paper",

    "the procedure begins by constructing a classical ( stochastic ) mathematical model of the multiverse as an infinite system , defined on a fine - grained lattice that grows exponentially like the multiverse itself .",
    "the model is defined by choosing a probability distribution for the field values at the initial time step , and then giving an update rule that determines the probabilities for the @xmath77 time step in terms of the previous ones .",
    "we believe that such a model can be as well - defined as the properties of the integers .",
    "since the model is infinite from the start , the danger that time might end does not seem to be present .",
    "following the standard procedure for a global time cutoff , one then defines a sample spacetime region in the model , which grows without limit as some final cutoff time @xmath31 approaches infinity . the relative probability between any two types of stories is then defined as the ratio of the number of occurrences in the sample spacetime region , in the limit as @xmath0 . as far as we can tell ,",
    "this system is rigorously mathematically consistent .",
    "however , we do have to admit that it has counter - intuitive properties .",
    "in particular , this system predicts that if the outcome of some experiment is reported with a time delay , where the length of the delay depends on the result , then the observation of the reports will be biased .",
    "the probability of observing the report with the shortest time delay will be higher than the probability that this result occurred . for measures such as scale - factor cutoff measure",
    ", this effect would be far too small to observe , but it will be present in principle .",
    "while it is easy to see how the time - delay bias arises in the global time cutoff calculation , some physicists might still find it offensively counter - intuitive .",
    "since we are not arguing that this measure is correct  only that it is consistent  it is certainly appropriate for anyone who finds this approach counter - intuitive to look for other solutions to the measure problem .",
    "counter - intuitiveness is a subjective judgment .",
    "we , however , feel that the transition from conventional probability to probabilities in the multiverse is a sufficiently large step that we should not expect all of our conventional intuition to carry over .",
    "finally , we should clarify that the probability measure proposed here is only a prescription .",
    "that is , we are describing a way to define probabilities , but we do not know of any physical mechanism that might cause it to be the correct definition to use for making predictions . on this issue",
    ", the end - of - time approach has a possible advantage .",
    "if time really does end , then the spacetime becomes finite , and probabilities can be unambiguously defined by counting .",

    "sleeping beauty is left alone in the room , but is told that when the clock reads 12:00 , if the coin is a head , an identical copy would be created of her and the entire room .",
    "if the coin is a tail , nothing is done . before the clock reads 12:00 , the probability that the coin is a head is clearly 50% , since it is a fair coin .",
    "after 12:00 , what is it ?",
    "the literature on the sleeping beauty problem includes papers supporting a wide variety of approaches , but here we follow a counting procedure that we find straightforward , and analogous to the counting procedure we are proposing for the multiverse .",
    "if the experiment were repeated @xmath1 times , the expectation value for the number of heads and tails are each @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath1 is chosen to be a large number , the standard deviation would be relatively small , so we can expect @xmath84 to be a good approximation to the actual number of heads and tails . since sleeping beauty is cloned in the case of heads , there would be @xmath1 sleeping beauties who would find that the coin is a head , and @xmath84 who would find a tail .",
    "thus , the probability is 2/3 that the coin is a head .",
    "even though the coin has already been flipped , sleeping beauty would conclude as the clock reaches 12:00 that the probability of the coin being a head suddenly changes from 1/2 to 2/3 .",
    "this may not look much like the multiverse , but it illustrates the principle that probabilities can change with time .    while the cloning of a person is technologically out of sight",
    ", the cloning of a computer is easy . starting with two computers with matching hardware",
    ", one can arrange for the memory and hard drives of the two computers to match byte by byte .",
    "computers can also be switched on and off , with no ambiguity about whether they can detect the passage of time when they are off .",
    "so , to continue , we will imagine that our subjects are computers .        to start , consider the sequence of events described in fig.[fig : cloning1 ] .",
    "this is still not the multiverse model , but it is a useful steppingstone . at @xmath143 ,",
    "two computers are deployed .",
    "the computers are identical , except that the first is a head computer , with an h engraved on its case , and the second is a tail computer , with a t engraved on its case .",
    "neither computer can read its engraving , but they are programmed to compute the probability that it is an h. the head computer is turned on after one minute , but the tail computer is turned on after 1 hour .",
    "the computers have internal clocks ; when each computer is turned on it is set to the current time , so once the computers are both running they are perfect clones of each other , matching at every instant of time .",
    "the computer programs are written with knowledge of the procedures for the experiment , but the same program runs on both computers , so it can not know if it is running on an @xmath144 computer or a @xmath145 computer . between 1 min and 1 hr , therefore ,",
    "the program concludes that it is 100% likely to be the @xmath144 computer , since the @xmath145 computer is scheduled to be off . at @xmath146",
    "hr , the program knows that the @xmath145 computer is switched on , and also that it has no way to determine if it is running on the @xmath144 computer or the @xmath145 computer .",
    "it therefore announces that the probability is now only 50% that it is the @xmath144 computer . at @xmath147 hr ,",
    "100 more pairs of @xmath144 & @xmath145 computers are deployed , all identical to the originals .",
    "the @xmath144 computers are switched on at @xmath148 min , while the @xmath145 computers are not switched on until @xmath149 hr . the internal clocks are always set to the current time , so all running computers are perfect clones of each other .",
    "now the computers announce at @xmath148 min that the probability of being an @xmath144 computer is 101/102 . at @xmath149",
    "hr the probability of @xmath144 returns to 50% .",
    "the probability is simply determined by the population of computers that are currently running , which can shift in arbitrary ways . in our example",
    "the computers are always deployed in @xmath144@xmath145 pairs , but they are turned on at different times , resulting in nonuniform probabilities .",
    "our picture of the multiverse differs in an important way from the above example , in that time is treated differently . in the multiverse",
    "we imagine that a global time coordinate can be defined , as we did in our description of a lattice simulation , but observers have no way of accessing this coordinate .",
    "the statistics of the lattice simulation are regularized by selecting a sample spacetime region , which can become larger and larger as the final cutoff time @xmath27 is taken to infinity .",
    "for any value of @xmath31 , as the limit is taken , we can determine the predictions for any experiment by imagining that the experiment we are carrying out is equally likely to be any copy of the experiment that we can find in the sample spacetime region .",
    "there is no notion of the current time in the sample spacetime region , but there is a cutoff time @xmath27 , which plays a very similar role .",
    "suppose we consider the g ",
    "v thought experiment , which was diagrammed in the multiverse as fig .",
    "[ fig : paradox ] .",
    "we have redrawn the diagram with some extra annotation as fig .",
    "[ fig : cloning2 ] .",
    "if we wish to consider the possibility that i might be the tail subject , then one of the possible instances would be the one marked @xmath150 .",
    "but for any instance , such as @xmath150 , for which the tail subject wake - up fits under the cutoff , there will be many copies of the experiment that begin later , such as @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 .",
    "each copy involves both a head subject and a tail subject , but in most of these copies the awakening of the tail subject will not occur under the cutoff .",
    "thus , when we take into account both the cloning ( i.e. , the appearance of new copies ) and the cutoff , we can see how the global time cutoff measure predicts more head subject wake - ups than tail subject wake - ups .",

    "<S> the definition of probabilities in eternally inflating universes requires a measure to regulate the infinite spacetime volume , and much of the current literature uses a global time cutoff for this purpose . </S>",

    "<S> our formulation begins with a mathematical model of the infinite multiverse , which can be constructed without the use of a measure . </S>",
    "<S> probabilities , which obey all the standard requirements for a probability measure , can then be defined by mathematical limits . </S>",
    "<S> they have a peculiar feature , however , which we call time - delay bias : if the outcome of an experiment is reported with a time delay that depends on the outcome , then the observation of the reports will be biased in favor of the shorter time delay . </S>",
