    "in the @xmath3 process , the quarks that are produced are unpolarized , but their spins are correlated .",
    "this is required by angular momentum conservation in the strong interaction . in general , this correlation is unobservable , as the hadronization process involves the emission of gluons that can flip the spins of the quarks .",
    "but the top quark provides a laboratory for studying the correlation .",
    "the short lifetime of top , about @xmath4  s , is shorter than the timescale for strong processes , so top decays before fragmentation and spin flips can occur .",
    "thus , the original spin orientation is preserved , and is passed to the decay products .",
    "it should then be observable through a study of the kinematics of the decay products .",
    "a measurement of top - quark spin correlation is a test of top - quark properties and also a probe of new physics .",
    "the very observation of the correlation could in principle be used to set an upper limit on the top lifetime .",
    "should top have a non - standard decay ( such as @xmath5 ) , or non - standard production mechanism ( through decays of stop pairs , or a @xmath6 resonance ) , a non - standard correlation would be observed .",
    "the correlation is ultimately a subtle effect ",
    "the theme of this presentation  but there is now enough tevatron data to explore it .",
    "at the tevatron , the primary production mode of @xmath0 is through @xmath7 with an @xmath8-channel gluon .",
    "( this is in contrast to the lhc , where the initial state is primarily @xmath9 ) .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 must have opposite helicity to couple to that gluon , and that forces the @xmath12 and @xmath13 to have their spins pointing along the beamline .",
    "a correlation strength can be defined based on the number of @xmath0 pairs with their spins pointing in the same direction , @xmath14    but the spin orientation must be defined with respect to a quantization axis . in the measurements described here ,",
    "the beamline axis , defined as the direction of the colliding hadrons in the zero - momentum frame of the @xmath0 system , is used .",
    "this choice is intuitive , easy to construct , and optimal for @xmath0 produced at threshold . with",
    "this choice of quantization axis , next - to - leading order qcd calculations predict @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the spin orientation of the top is then passed to its decay products .",
    "the differential angular decay distributions of the top daughters is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the angle between the @xmath18th top daughter and the spin of the top .",
    "different decay products have different correlation strengths , as indicated by @xmath19 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : angles ] . in the case of a leptonic @xmath20 decay ,",
    "the lepton has the greatest analyzing power , and for a hadronic @xmath20 decay it is the down - type quark . in both cases , @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the doubly - differential cross section as a function of the decay angles of decay products from two different quarks in @xmath0 is given by @xmath22 to study the spin correlation , one looks for correlation between the directions of decay products from the two different top decays .",
    "in the case of both tops decaying leptonically , @xmath23 , and we write @xmath24 .",
    "the measurements described below were performed at the fermilab tevatron , a @xmath2 collider operating at @xmath25  tev . run  ii of the collider has been in progress since 2001 , with almost 12  fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity delivered .",
    "the spin - correlation measurements make use of 5.4  fb@xmath1 .",
    "the data was recorded by the d0 detector , which consists of silicon and fiber trackers inside a 2  t solenoid , a liquid argon - uranium calorimeter , and muon trackers and scintillators inside toroids .    at the tevatron ,",
    "85% of @xmath0 production arises from @xmath26 annihilation and the remaining 15% from @xmath9 interactions .",
    "each top quark decays to @xmath27 nearly 100% of the time , and the final states are characterized by the @xmath20 decay modes .",
    "the three final states are all - hadronic , lepton plus jets and dilepton . in the order",
    "listed , the final states have decreasing rate and increasing number of neutrinos and signal purity .",
    "the dilepton state in particular is characterized by two high-@xmath28 leptons , missing momentum due to the escaping neutrinos , two hadronic jets from @xmath29 decays , and perhaps additional jets due to initial- and final - state radiation . for the purpose of the spin - correlation measurements ,",
    "the dilepton state has the best analyzing power and most accurate measurement of the decay - product ( lepton ) directions , but the worst statistical power , compared to other final states that could be considered .",
    "the two measurements described have the same event selection .",
    "a @xmath0-enriched sample is chosen by selecting events with two high-@xmath28 , isolated , opposite - charge leptons .",
    "only electrons and muons are considered as leptons , so the dilepton pairs can be either @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath32 .. there must also be at least two high-@xmath28 jets . to suppress backgrounds , a large scalar sum of the lepton and jet @xmath28 values",
    "is required in the @xmath31 channel , and significant missing energy in the @xmath30 and @xmath32 channels .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath33 ( diboson ) events are modeled by leading - order monte carlo samples , and normalized to next - to - next - to - leading ( next - to - leading ) order cross sections .",
    "instrumental backgrounds arise from misidentified @xmath34 and @xmath35 decays in electron samples and real muons in jets that appear to be isolated in muon samples ; both of these are modeled with complementary data samples .",
    "the selected data sample is about 70% pure in @xmath0 events , as shown in table  [ tab : events ] .",
    ".estimates of contributions of various physics processes to the selected dilepton sample . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : matrix_errors ]",
    "quark spin correlation is a phenomenon that can only be seen in @xmath0 production , thanks to the short top lifetime .",
    "however , it is a subtle effect that requires large data samples and sophisticated analysis techniques to observe .",
    "indeed , the matrix - element technology is perhaps the most powerful , and most complex , analysis tool that is currently available for tevatron data analyses , and it was required here to have the hope of observing the effects of interest .",
    "two analyses of @xmath0 dilepton events at d0 have been performed .",
    "one was a template - based analysis using full reconstruction of top decays , giving a result within two standard deviations of the nlo qcd prediction , but also compatible with the no - correlation hypothesis .",
    "the other one was a matrix - element - based analysis that gives a result consistent with the sm hypothesis , and powerful enough to exclude the no - correlation hypothesis for the first time ever .",
    "both analyses are statistics limited , with only about half of the final d0 run  ii data sample analyzed so far .",
    "thus , there is great potential for improving the precision of the measurements in the near future .",
    "i thank the d0 `` spinners '' ( alexander grohsjean , tim head , yvonne peters and christian schwanenberger ) for their advice while i was preparing this presentation , and the d0 collaboration for giving me the opportunity to present these interesting results .",
    "i also thank the organizers of the dpf 2011 conference for an engaging and enjoyable week ."
