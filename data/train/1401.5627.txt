    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data produced by the final analysis of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite and , more recently , by the planck satellite  @xcite confirme the standard cosmological lambda cold matter ( @xmath2cdm ) model at an unprecedented level of accuracy . at large scales , however , several anomalous features have been reported : an unusual alignment of the preferred axes of the quadrupole and octopole  @xcite , non - gaussian signatures due to a cold spot  @xcite , an hemispherical power asymmetry at large scales  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that one of the most important discrepancy resides in the low quadrupole moment , which signals an important suppression of power at large scales .",
    "in fact , the planck collaboration reported a statistical significant tension between the best fit @xmath2cdm model and the large - scale spectrum due to a systematic lack of power for @xmath3  @xcite and to anomalies in the statistical isotropy of the sky maps  @xcite . +",
    "if these anomalies should turn out to have a cosmological origin , then it could have far reaching consequences for our present understanding of the universe .",
    "+ quite recently it has been suggested  @xcite that , if one admits that the large - scale spatial geometry of our universe is only plane - symmetric with eccentricity at decoupling of order @xmath4 , then the quadrupole amplitude can be drastically reduced without affecting higher multipoles of the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the anisotropic expansion described by a plane - symmetric metric can be generated by cosmological magnetic fields or topological defects , such as cosmic domain walls or cosmic strings .",
    "indeed , topological cosmic defects are relic structures that are predicted to be produced in the course of symmetry breaking in the hot , early universe ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "+      in an isotropic and homogeneous universe the most general metric is the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in particular ,",

    "+ in this paper we shall further elaborate on the ellipsoidal universe proposal and extend previous investigations in several directions . for reader",
    "s convenience , it is useful to summarize the main results of the present paper .",
    "+ first , we consider the boltzmann equation for the photon distribution in the ellipsoidal universe , discussed for the first time in @xcite , by taking into account also the effects of the cosmological inflation produced primordial scalar perturbations . in the large scale approximation",
    "we explicitly show that the cmb temperature fluctuations can be written as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the temperature fluctuations induced by the cosmological scalar perturbations and by the spatial anisotropy of the metric of the universe , respectively .",
    "since the temperature anisotropies caused by the inflation produced primordial scalar perturbations are discussed in several textbooks  @xcite , we focus on the temperature fluctuations induced by the anisotropy of the metric by solving the relevant boltzmann equation . at large scales",
    "we solve that equation and determine the solutions relevant for the cmb temperature and polarization fluctuations . indeed , it is well known  @xcite that anisotropic cosmological models give sizable contributions to the large scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "in fact , polarization measurements could provide a unique signature of cosmological anisotropies .",
    "+ we go beyond the approximations adopted in @xcite and confirm that the main contributions to the cmb temperature fluctuations affect the quadrupole correlations .",
    "in addition , we also show that the effects of the spatial anisotropy of the metric of the universe extend to low - lying multipoles @xmath16 .",
    "+ as is well known , the cmb temperature fluctuations are fully characterized by the power spectrum : @xmath17 in particular , the quadrupole anisotropy refers to the multipole @xmath18 .",
    "remarkably , the planck data  @xcite confirmed that the observed quadrupole anisotropy : @xmath19 is much smaller than the quadrupole anisotropy expected according to the best fit @xmath2cdm model to the planck data : @xmath20 note that in eq .",
    "( [ 1.6 ] ) we are neglecting the rather small measurement errors , while the uncertainties due to the so - called cosmic variance are included in the theoretical expectations , eq .",

    "( [ 1.4 ] ) we show that the quadrupole temperature anisotropy can be reconciled with observations in the ellipsoidal universe if the eccentricity at decoupling is : @xmath21 irrespective of the physical mechanism responsible for the generation of the spatial anisotropy in the early universe .",
    "moreover , if we denote with @xmath22 and @xmath23 the galactic latitude and longitude of the symmetry axis respectively , we also were able to show that the axis of symmetry were constrained to : @xmath24 while the longitude @xmath22 turns out to be poorly constrained , in qualitative agreement with @xcite .",
    "+ as concern the cmb polarization , we confirm our previous result  @xcite that the ellipsoidal geometry of the universe induces sizable polarization signal at large scales without invoking the reionization scenario .",
    "in particular , we find an average large scale polarization : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the polarization of the cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "moreover , we evaluate the quadrupole temperature - polarization cross - correlation ( te ) and polarization - polarization ( ee ) correlation .",
    "we find : @xmath27 and @xmath28 these values should be compared with the available observational data . since the planck collaboration does not yet make public the large scale polarization data , we must rely on the final analysis of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe collaboration .",
    "the wmap nine - year full - sky maps of the polarization detected at large scales in the foreground corrected maps an average e - mode polarization power  @xcite . in particular for the quadrupole correlations we have ( including only the statistical uncertainties ) : @xmath29 and @xmath30 using the definition in eq .",

    "we believe that this discrepancy could be due to the fact that in the ellipsoidal universe model , at variance of the standard reionization scenario , there is a non - zero average temperature polarization .",
