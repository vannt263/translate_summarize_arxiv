    "while the low - index semiconductor surfaces have dominated the interest of surface scientists for several decades , at present a considerable amount of work is being dedicated to high - index orientations . since the high - index surfaces exhibit more diverse structural and electronic properties",
    ", the adept use of these properties can constitute the key for various technological applications , in particular for the fabrication of devices at length scales where lithographic techniques are not applicable .",
    "controlling certain physical processes ( e.g. , growth of nanostructures in a preferred direction ) depends in part on having knowledge of the structure of the substrate surface .",
    "the main technique for investigating atomic - scale features of surfaces is scanning tunelling microscopy ( stm ) , although stm alone is only able to provide `` a range of speculative structural models which are increasingly regarded as solved surface structures '' @xcite .",
    "a common procedure for finding the reconstructions of silicon surfaces consists in a combination of stm imaging and density functional calculations as follows .",
    "starting from the bulk truncated surface and taking cues from the experimental data , one proposes several atomic models for the surface reconstructions .",
    "these models are then relaxed using electronic structure methods ; at the end of relaxation , surface energies and stm images are _ computed _ for each structural model . a match with the experimental stm data",
    "is identified based on the relaxed lowest - energy structures and their simulated stm images ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as described , the procedure is heuristic , as one needs to rely heavily on physical intuition when proposing good candidates for the lowest energy reconstructions of high - index surfaces .",
    "treating the reconstruction of semiconductor surfaces as a problem of global optimization , we have recently developed a parallel tempering monte carlo procedure for studying the structure and thermodynamics of crystal surfaces @xcite , as well as a genetic algorithm for structure determination @xcite .",
    "the use of such methods can help avoid situations in which the actual physical reconstruction of a high - index surface is not part of the set of heuristic models that are considered for computation of surface energies and comparison with experimental data .",
    "given that there are examples of semiconductor surfaces ( e.g. , @xcite ) for which the initially proposed models did not withstand further scientific scrutiny from different research groups , it appears worthwhile to perform searches for the structure of some of stable high - index surface orientations of silicon .",
    "one such surface is si(114 ) , reported to be as stable as the well studied low - index surfaces si(001 ) and si(111 ) @xcite : given this stability of si(114 ) , it is somewhat surprising that this surface has not attracted more interest , at least from a technological perspective .",
    "there are few studies of si(114 ) to date , which include the pioneering study reporting on the atomic configuration @xcite , and two recent works reporting on the electronic structure of this surface @xcite .    based on scanning tunelling microscope ( stm ) images combined with density functional calculations , two atomic models [ ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath1 ) ] ,",
    "were proposed for the si(114 ) orientation @xcite .",
    "these models have very similar bonding topology , differing only in terms of dimerization pattern of their surface .",
    "the surface energies of the two models are also similar , as both can be found on sufficiently large areas of the scanned samples @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "so far ref .",
    "@xcite represents the _ only _ proposal for the structure of si(114 ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present several other model candidates for the structure of si(114 ) , models that are likely to be experimentally observed on this surface . addressing the problem of atomic structure from a different perspective than the previous reports @xcite , we perform stochastic searches for the global minimum configuration of this surface .",
    "as we shall see , the lowest energy configuration ( at zero kelvin ) obtained here from purely theoretical means is consistent with the original proposal @xcite ; however , the global search methods provide several other structural models with low surface energy , which could be relevant in various experimental conditions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the two recently developed global search algorithms , the parallel tempering monte carlo methods and the genetic algorithm for structure determination . while brief descriptions of these methods are provided in sec .",
    "ii , we refer the reader to our recent works @xcite for full details related to their implementation . the results of the structural optimization for si(114 ) surface are presented and discussed in section iii , and our conclusions are outlined in the last section .",
    "the reconstructions of semiconductor surfaces are determined not only by the efficient bonding of the surface atoms , but also by the stress created in the process @xcite .",
    "therefore , we retain a large number of subsurface atoms when performing a global search for the lowest energy configuration : this way the surface stress is intrinsically considered when reconstructions are sorted out .",
    "the number of local minima of the potential energy is also large , as it scales roughly exponentially @xcite with the number of atoms involved in the reconstruction ; by itself , such scaling requires the use of fast stochastic search methods .",
    "one such method is the parallel - tempering monte carlo ( ptmc ) algorithm @xcite , which was shown to successfully find the reconstructions of a vicinal si surface when coupled with an exponential cooling @xcite . before outlining the procedure ,",
    "we discuss briefly the computational cell and the empirical potential used .",
    "the simulation cell ( of dimensions @xmath2 in the plane of the surface ) has a single - face slab geometry with periodic boundary conditions applied in the plane of the surface , and no periodicity in the direction normal to it .",
    "the `` hot '' atoms from the top part of the slab ( 1015    thick ) are allowed to move , while the bottom layers of atoms are kept fixed to simulate the underlying bulk crystal .",
    "the area of the simulation cell and the number of atoms in the cell are kept fixed during each simulation . under these conditions ,",
    "the problem of finding the most stable reconstruction reduces to the global minimization of the total potential energy @xmath3 of the atoms in the simulation cell ( here @xmath4 denotes the set of atomic positions ) . in terms of atomic interactions , we are constrained to use empirical potentials because the highly accurate ab - initio or tight - binding methods are prohibitive as far as the search itself is concerned .",
    "since this work is aimed at finding the _ lowest _ energy reconstructions for arbitrary surfaces , the choice of the empirical potential is important .",
    "after numerical experimentation with several empirical models , we chose to use the highly optimized empirical potential ( hoep ) recently developed by lenosky _",
    "hoep is fitted to a large database of ab - initio calculations using the force - matching method , and provides a good description of the energetics of all atomic coordinations up to @xmath5 .",
    "the parallel tempering monte carlo method ( also known as the replica - exchange monte - carlo method ) consists in running parallel canonical simulations of many statistically independent replicas of the system , each at a different temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the set of @xmath7 temperatures @xmath8 is called a temperature schedule ( or schedule for short ) .",
    "the probability distributions of the individual replicas are sampled with the metropolis algorithm @xcite , although any other ergodic strategy can be employed @xcite .",
    "irrespective of what sampling strategy is being used for each replica , the key feature of the parallel tempering method is that swaps between replicas of neighboring temperatures @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are proposed and allowed with the conditional probability @xcite given by @xmath12/k_b}\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 represents the energy of the replica @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the conditional probability ( [ eq : ptmcacc ] ) ensures that the detailed balance condition is satisfied and that the equilibrium distributions are the boltzmann ones for each temperature .    in the limit of low temperatures ,",
    "the ptmc procedure allows for a geometric temperature schedule @xcite . to show this",
    ", we note that when the temperature drops to zero , the system is well approximated by a multidimensional harmonic oscillator , so the acceptance probability for swaps attempted between two replicas with temperatures @xmath16 is given by the incomplete beta function law @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the number of degrees of freedom of the system , @xmath19 is the euler beta function , and @xmath20 .",
    "since it depends only on the temperature ratio @xmath21 , the acceptance probability ( [ eq : actt ] ) has the same value for any arbitrary replica running at a temperature @xmath9 , provided that its neighboring upper temperature @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 . the value of @xmath21 is determined such that the acceptance probability given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : actt ] ) attains a prescribed value @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the ( optimal ) schedule that ensures a constant probability @xmath24 for swaps between neighboring temperatures is a geometric progression : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the minimum temperature of the schedule .",
    "the typical monte carlo simulation done in this work consists of two main parts that are equal in terms of computational effort . in the first stage of the computation ,",
    "we perform a parallel tempering run for a range of temperatures @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the configurations of minimum energy are retained for each replica , and used as starting configurations for the second part of the simulation , in which replicas are cooled down exponentially until the largest temperature drops below a prescribed value .",
    "as a key feature of the procedure , the parallel tempering swaps are not turned off during the cooling steps .",
    "thus , in the second part of the simulation we are in fact using a combination of parallel tempering and simulated annealing , rather than a simple cooling . at the @xmath28-th cooling step , each temperature from the initial temperature schedule @xmath29 is decreased by a factor which is independent of the index @xmath14 of the replica , @xmath30 because the parallel tempering swaps are not turned off , we require that at any cooling step @xmath28 all @xmath7 temperatures must be modified by the same factor @xmath31 in order to preserve the original swap acceptance probabilities .",
    "we have used a cooling schedule of the form @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the third and final part of the minimization procedure is a conjugate - gradient optimization of the last configurations attained by each replica .",
    "the relaxation is necessary because we aim to classify the reconstructions in a way that does not depend on temperature , so we compute the surface energy at zero kelvin for the relaxed slabs @xmath35 .",
    "the surface energy @xmath36 is defined as the excess energy ( with respect to the ideal bulk configuration ) introduced by the presence of the surface : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the potential energy of the @xmath39 atoms that are allowed to move , @xmath40ev is the bulk cohesion energy given by hoep , and @xmath41 is the surface area of the slab .    , ( @xmath42 with total number of atoms @xmath43 ( solid circles ) , 215 ( open triangles ) , 214 ( open circles ) and 213 ( solid triangles ) .",
    "for clarity , the range of plotted surface energies was limited from above at 100 mev / @xmath44 .",
    "( b ) surface energy of the global minimum structure showing a periodic behavior as a function of @xmath45 , with a period of @xmath46 ; this finding helps narrowing down the set of values for @xmath45 that need to be considered for determining the si(114 ) reconstructions that have a @xmath47 periodic cell .",
    ", width=340 ]    at the end of the simulation , we analyze the energies of the relaxed replicas .",
    "typical plots showing the surface energies of the structures retrieved by the ptmc replicas are shown in fig .",
    "[ 214_216_ptmc](a ) , for different numbers of particles in the computational cell . to exhaust all the possibilities for the numbers of particles corresponding to the supercell dimensions of @xmath2 , we repeat the ptmc simulation for different values of @xmath45 ranging from 208 to 220 , and look for a periodic behavior of the lowest surface energy as a function of @xmath45 . for the case of si(114 ) , this periodicity occurs at intervals of @xmath48 , as shown in fig .  [ 214_216_ptmc](b ) .",
    "therefore , the ( correct ) number of atoms @xmath45 at which the lowest surface energy is attained is @xmath43 , up to an integer multiple of @xmath49 .",
    "as we shall show in the next section , the repetition of the simulation for different values of @xmath45 in the simulation cell can be avoided within a genetic algorithm approach .      like the previous method",
    ", the genetic algorithm also circumvents the intuitive process when proposing candidate models for a given high - index surface .",
    "an advantage of this algorithm over most of the previous methodologies used for structural optimization is that the number of atoms involved in the reconstruction , as well as their most favorable bonding topology , can be found within the same genetic search .",
    "the development of a genetic algorithm ( ga ) for surface structure determination was motivated by its successful application for the structural optimization of atomic clusters @xcite .",
    "this search procedure is based on the idea of evolutionary approach in which the members of a generation ( pool of models for the surface ) mate with the goal of producing the best specimens , i.e. lowest energy reconstructions .",
    "`` generation zero '' is a pool of @xmath24 different structures obtained by randomizing the positions of the topmost atoms ( thickness @xmath18 ) , and by subsequently relaxing the simulation slabs through a conjugate - gradient procedure .",
    "the evolution from a generation to the next one takes place by mating , which is achieved by subjecting two randomly picked structures from the pool to a certain operation ( mating ) @xmath50:(a , b)@xmath51c .",
    "the mating operation @xmath52 produces a child structure c from two parent configurations a and b , as follows .",
    "the topmost parts of the parent models a and b ( thickness @xmath18 ) are separated from the underlying bulk and sectioned by an arbitrary plane perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the ( upper part of the ) child structure c is created by combining the part of a that lies to the left of the cutting plane and the part of slab b lying to the right of that plane : the assembly is placed on a thicker slab , and the resulting structure c is subsequently relaxed .",
    "a mechanism for the survival of the fittest is implemented as a defining feature of the genetic evolution . in each generation , a number of @xmath53 mating operations are performed .",
    "the resulting @xmath53 children are relaxed and considered for the possible inclusion in the pool based on their surface energy .",
    "if there exists at least one candidate in the pool that has a higher surface energy than that of the child considered , then the child structure is included in the pool . upon inclusion of the child ,",
    "the structure with the highest surface energy is discarded in order to preserve the total population @xmath24 .",
    "as described , the algorithm favors the crowding of the ecology with identical metastable configurations , which slows down the evolution towards the global minimum . to avoid the duplication of members , we retain a new structure only if its surface energy differs by more than @xmath54 when compared to the surface energy of any of the current members @xmath24 of the pool .",
    "relevant values for the parameters of the algorithm are given in @xcite : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57  , and @xmath58mev / @xmath44 .",

    "( b ) evolution of the number of atoms @xmath45 that corresponds to the model with the lowest energy from the pool , during the same ga run .",
    "note that the lowest energy structure of the pool spends most of its evolution in states with numbers of atoms that are compatible with the global minimum , i.e. @xmath60 and @xmath43 .",
    ", width=340 ]    we have developed two versions of the algorithm . in the first version",
    ", the number of atoms @xmath45 is kept the same for every member of the pool by automatically rejecting child structures that have different numbers of atoms from their parents ( mutants ) . in the second version of the algorithm ,",
    "this restriction is not enforced , i.e. mutants are allowed to be part of the pool : in this case , the procedure is able to select the correct number of atoms for the ground state reconstruction without any increase over the computational effort required for one single constant-@xmath45 run .",
    "the results of a variable-@xmath45 run are shown in fig .",
    "[ ga - var - n](a ) which shows how the lowest energy and the average energy from a pool of @xmath61 structures decreases as the genetic algorithm run proceeds .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ ga - var - n](a ) displays typical features of the evolutionary approach : the most unfavorable structures are eliminated from the pool rather fast ( initial steep transient region of the graphs ) and a longer time is taken for the algorithm to retrieve the most stable configuration . the lowest energy structure is retrieved in less than 500 mating operations . the correct number of atoms [ refer to fig .",
    "[ ga - var - n](b ) ] is retrieved much faster , within approximately 100 operations .",
    "it is worth noting that even during the transient period , the lowest - energy member of the pool spends most of its evolution in a state with a number of atoms ( @xmath60 ) that is compatible with the global minimum structure .",
    "the two independent algorithms ( ptmc and ga ) presented briefly in this section are able to retrieve a set of possible candidates for the lowest energy surface structure .",
    "we use both of the algorithms in this work in order to assess how robust their structure predictions are . as it turns out , the two methods not only find the same lowest energy structures for each value of the total number of atoms @xmath45 , but also most of the other low - energy reconstructions  a finding that builds confidence in the quality of the configuration sampling performed here .",
    "since the atomic interactions are modelled by an empirical potential @xcite , it is desirable to check the relative stability of different model structures using higher - level calculations based on density functional theory ; the details of these calculations are presented next .      using the methodologies described above ,",
    "we build a database of model structures that are sorted according to the surface energy given by the hoep @xcite interaction model .",
    "since the empirical potentials may not give a reliable energetic ordering when a large number of structures are considered , we recalculate the surface energies of the models in the database at the level of density functional theory .",
    "the calculations where performed with the plane - wave based pwscf package @xcite , using the perdew - zunger @xcite exchange - correlation energy . the slab geometry and",
    "the computational parameters are similar to the ones reported in @xcite ; given the increase in computational speed over the last eight years , we used thicker slabs and a different sampling of the brillouin zone .",
    "the cutoff for the plane - wave energy was set to 12 ry , and the irreducible brilloiun zone was sampled with 4 @xmath28 points . the equilibrium bulk lattice constant was determined to be @xmath625.41 , which was used for all the surface calculations in this work .",
    "the simulation cell has the single - face slab geometry , with 24 layers of si , and a vacuum thickness of 12  .",
    "the bottom three layers are kept fixed in order to simulate the underlying bulk geometry , and the lowest layer is passivated with hydrogen .",
    "the remaining si layers are allowed to relax until the forces become smaller than 0.025 ev /  .",
    "the surface energy @xmath36 for each reconstruction is determined indirectly , by first considering the surface energy @xmath63 of an unrelaxed bulk truncated slab , then by calculating the difference @xmath64 between the surface energy of the actual reconstruction and the surface energy of bulk truncated slab that has the bottom three layers fixed and hydrogenated .",
    "the energy of the bulk truncated surface , as computed from a two - faced slab with 24 layers , was found to be @xmath65 mev / @xmath44 .",
    "this indirect procedure for calculating the surface energies at the dft level was outlined , for instance , in ref .",
    "at the end of the global search procedures , we obtain a set of model structures which we sort by the number of atoms in the simulation cell and by their surface energy .",
    "since the empirical potentials may not be fully transferable to different surface environments , we study not only the global minima given by the model for different values of @xmath45 , but also most of the local minima that are within 15 mev / @xmath44 from the lowest energy configurations .",

    "the optimum structure [ [ 216-si114](a ) ] , however , has twice as many dangling bonds but the surface energy is smaller , @xmath79 mev / @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , for the same number of atoms in the supercell ( @xmath43 ) and the same dangling bond density ( @xmath80 ) , the different reconstructions obtained via global searches span an energy interval of at least 5 mev / @xmath44 .",
    "these findings constitute a clear example that the number of dangling bonds can not be used as a criterion for selecting model reconstructions for si(114 ) ; we expect this conclusion to hold for many other high - index semiconductor surfaces as well .",
    "the hoep surface energy and the dft surface energy also show very little correlation , indicating that the transferability of the interaction model @xcite for si(114 ) is not as good as , for instance , in the case of si(001 ) and si(105 ) @xcite .",
    "the most that can be asked from this model potential @xcite is that the observed reconstruction @xcite is amongst the lower lying energetic configurations which , in this case it is .",
    "we have also tested the transferability of hoep for the case of si(113 ) , and found that , although the ad - atom interstitial models @xcite are not the most stable structures , they are still retrieved by hoep as local minima of the surface energy .",
    "we found that the low - index ( but much more complex ) si(111)-@xmath81 reconstruction is also a local minimum of the hoep interaction model , albeit with a very high surface energy .",
    "other tests indicated that , while the transferability of hoep to the si(114 ) orientation is marginal in terms of sorting structural models by their surface energy , this potential @xcite performs much better than the more popular interaction models @xcite , which sometimes do not retrieve the correct reconstructions even as local minima .",
    "therefore , hoep is very useful as a way to find different local minimum configurations for further optimization at the level of electronic structure calculations .    a practical issue that arises when carrying out the global searches for surface reconstructions is the two - dimensional periodicity of the computational slab .",
    "in general , if a periodic surface pattern has been observed , then the lengths and directions of the surface unit vectors may be determined accurately through experimental means ( e.g. , stm or leed analysis ) : in those cases , the periodic vectors of the simulation slab should simply be chosen the same as the ones found in experiments .",
    "when the surface does not have two - dimensional periodicity , or when experimental data is difficult to analyze , then one should systematically test computational cells with periodic vectors that are integer multiples of the unit vectors of the bulk truncated surface , which are easily computed from knowledge of crystal structure and surface orientation .",
    "there is no preset criterion as to when the incremental testing of the size of the surface cell should be stopped other than the limitation imposed by finite computational resources ; nevertheless , this approach gives a systematic way of ranking the surface energies of slabs of different areas , and eventually finding the global minimum surface structure .",
    "motivated by a previous finding that larger unit cells can lead to models with very low surface energies ( see , for instance the example of si(105 ) @xcite ) , we have also performed global minimum search using ga for slabs of dimensions @xmath82 , which correspond to a doubling of the unit cell in the [ 22@xmath70 direction .",
    "the ground state structure at the hoep level found in this case is still the corrugated model [ 216-si114](b ) with a surface energy of @xmath83 mev / @xmath44 .",
    "as a low - lying configuration we again retrieve the original model @xcite with @xmath84 mev / @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , we also find a several models that have surface energy in between the two values , characterized by the presence of different @xmath47 structures in the two halves of the @xmath85 simulation cell .",
    "this finding suggests that [ 1@xmath860]-oriented boundaries between different @xmath87 models on si(114 ) are not energetically very costly : this is consistent with the experimental reports of erwin _ et al .",
    "_ , who indeed found @xmath75 and @xmath88 structures next to one another @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have obtained and classified structural candidates for the si(114 ) surface reconstructions using global optimization methods and density functional calculations .",
    "we have used both parallel - tempering monte carlo procedure coupled with an exponential cooling @xcite , as well as the genetic algorithm @xcite . both of the methods are used in conjunction with the latest empirical potential for silicon @xcite , which has a better transferability in comparison with more popular potentials @xcite .",
    "we have built a large database of structures ( reported , in part , in table  [ table_gamma_smcell ] ) which were further optimized at the dft level .",
    "the lowest energy structure that we found ( fig .  [ 216-si114](a ) ) after the dft relaxation is the same as the one originally reported for si(114)-(@xmath89 ) in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have discovered several other types of structures ( refer to figs .  [ 216-si114](b ) , [ 216-si114](c ) and [ 214-si114](a ) and [ 213-si114](a ) ) that are separated ( energetically ) by 12 mev / @xmath44 from the lowest energy model @xcite .",
    "given that the relative surface energies at the dft level have an error of @xmath90 mev / @xmath44 , and that the experiments of erwin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite already identified two reconstructions ( [ ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath91 ) ] whose surface energies are within 12 mev / @xmath44 from one another , it is conceivable that some of the models in figs .",
    "[ 216-si114][213-si114 ] could also be found on the si(114 ) surface .",
    "this prediction could be tested , e.g. , by high - resolution transmission electron microscopy experiments such as the ones reported recently for the si(5512 ) surface @xcite .",
    "low - energy electron diffraction experiments , as well as more stm measurements could also shed light on whether there exist other structural models on a clean si(114 ) surface than initially reported in ref .",
