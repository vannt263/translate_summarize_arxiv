    "consider a bgk system in one space dimension , for the unknowns @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 : @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the @xmath7 , for @xmath3 , are given distinct real values , and the functions @xmath8 are smooth functions of @xmath9 such that : @xmath10 following @xcite , we rewrite system in its _ conservative - dissipative _ form .",
    "this means that we assume that there exists an invertible matrix @xmath11 such that , setting @xmath12 , @xmath13 , the new unknown @xmath14 solves the system @xmath15 where @xmath16 is symmetric and @xmath17 is quadratic in @xmath9 , i.e. : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "observe that , after the transformation , the source term is zero in the first component and the second one is the sum of a quadratic term and of the dissipative term @xmath20 .",
    "it is proved in @xcite and @xcite that , under some additional conditions , usually induced by suitable entropy functions , and for initial data which are small perturbations of constant equilibrium states and smooth in some suitable norms , the corresponding smooth solutions exist globally and their @xmath21-norm decay , for large times , as @xmath22 and similar estimates are available for their space and time derivatives .",
    "notice that the improved estimate for the unknown @xmath23 can only be obtained in these new coordinates and does not hold for other combinations of the unknowns .",
    "the aim of this paper it to take advantage by these time decay estimates to build up more accurate numerical schemes . to be more specific , we show in the following that for standard numerical schemes , for instance upwind schemes with the source term approximated pointwise by the standard euler scheme , the local truncation error for the conservative - dissipative unknowns @xmath24 has the following decay as @xmath25 , for a fixed cfl ratio : @xmath26 it can be seen numerically that the corresponding absolute errors , for a fixed space step , decays as @xmath27 which implies , taking into account , that the relative error is essentially constant in time .    here , our main goal is to improve the decay rate of the truncation error to achieve an effective decay in time of the relative error , both in @xmath9 and @xmath23 . before presenting our strategy and our main results ,",
    "let us review some different attempts to design effective numerical approximations for hyperbolic equations with a source term .",
    "let us mention some families of schemes , sometimes overlapping : well balanced @xcite , runge - kutta imex @xcite , upwinding source @xcite , and asymptotic preserving @xcite .",
    "the main idea in all these schemes is to use some knowledge of the actual time behavior of the solutions to improve their numerical approximation , at least in some specific regimes .    in particular , in @xcite , the linear version of the present problem",
    "was considered and therefore , to approximate the solutions around non constant asymptotic states , some schemes were proposed , which had the property to become higher order ( in space ) for large times , thanks to the careful consideration of the analytical decay rates of the solutions .",
    "a different attempt was given by the well balanced schemes , see for instance @xcite , namely schemes which are exact when computed on stationary solutions of the problem , even if up to now , the time decay rate of the unsteady solutions has not yet been explicitely considered .",
    "however , the asymptotic preserving properties of some well balanced schemes , can yield nice results for large times , as in @xcite , see section [ sec5 ] below .    in the present case ,",
    "a striking difference with these previous works lies in the fact that the asymptotic equilibrium states are constant and therefore all the consistent schemes are _ exact _ on them .",
    "so , the goal of our work is a bit different . in this paper",
    ", we design schemes which are able to improve their performance for large times , when the initial data are small perturbations of a given constant equilibrium state . to obtain these results",
    ", we use the estimates in @xcite to perform a detailed analysis of the behavior of the truncation error for a general class of schemes , which generalize and improve those introduced in @xcite . thanks to this analysis",
    ", we are able construct schemes such that the truncation order behaves as @xmath28 for a fixed cfl ratio and such that their asymptotic numerical error , observed in the practical tests , improves of @xmath29 on the previous schemes .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce our analytical framework .",
    "the main schemes are derived in section [ sec3 ] , where we show how to improve the time decay of their local truncation error .",
    "sections [ sec_monot2x2 ] and [ 3x3case ] are devoted to the monotonicity conditions for the new scheme in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 cases respectively .",
    "then we present some remarks in the linear @xmath30 case , to allow a direct comparison with other schemes .",
    "section [ sec5 ] presents some numerical tests which show the nice behavior of our new schemes both in the linear and the nonlinear cases .",
    "let us observe that when transforming system in system , we can always assume that the block @xmath32 and @xmath33 have the special form @xmath34 and setting @xmath35 , we have that @xmath36 therefore , we can rewrite our system in a more compact form : @xmath37    to guarantee the existence of the matrix @xmath38 in , we can assume that our system is strictly entropy dissipative in the sense of @xcite and verifies the shizuta - kawashima condition @xcite .",
    "for instance , following bouchut @xcite , we may assume the following sufficient condition .",

    "the details of the derivation of the actual coefficients of this matrix , which in general is not unique , but depends on the entropy dissipative function , can be found in the general case in @xcite , and are not relevant for the following discussion , even if of course they are relevant to derive the final schemes .",
    "however , in the examples presented below , the matrix @xmath38 is always explicitly given .",
    "let us state now some general properties for the matrix @xmath38 that we shall use in the following , and which are easily derived under * condition ed*.    first of all , since @xmath44 in is symmetric , we have that the matrix @xmath45 and the diagonal matrix @xmath46 commute , i.e. @xmath47",

    "the problem is dissipative in the sense of @xcite and the shizuta - kawashima condition is verified , at least for small values of @xmath9 , and so , at least for smooth and small initial data , there exists again a global smooth solution to the same problem . to obtain the time decay rates of these solutions , we need to rewrite the problem in the _ conservative  dissipative _ coordinates .",
