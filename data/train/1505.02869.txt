    "the photometric and structural properties of such ppocs are similar to those of asterisms which sometime creates conflicting classifications @xcite .",

    "only the cmd morphology may provide clues to the overdensity nature @xcite . in order to understand the difference between sparse clusters and asterisms as well as to find out any possible connection between them , we studied a poorly populated stellar system with a stellar enhanced region including ppocs . for this , we searched ppoc systems in the webda database and all available catalogues on vizier services .",

    "the bukowiecki et al . relation ( @xmath30 ) is used to estimate the limiting radius ( @xmath31 ) of the cluster that comes out to be @xmath32 , which is significantly smaller than the radius of the stellar system . since , the system is gravitationally",
    "bound within @xmath33 arcmin and the model stellar radius is larger than expected gravitational attraction , therefore , the said stellar system may not be fall on the category of ocs .",

    "our estimated core - radius and system - radius are in close agreement with those determined by the kharchenko et al . .",
    "the number of stars per magnitude interval in unit area is defined as the surface number density ( snd ) , @xmath37 , and is a function of stellar magnitude and radius from the center @xcite .",
    "we computed the @xmath37 for both the system and field regions as drawn in fig .",
    "we see that the @xmath37 of each region increases towards the higher magnitude end of each region .",
    "the snd profile of the system indicates that the system region have enhanced brighter stars compared to the fainter stars .",
    "the system stars are further divided into two groups through their snd profiles namely a ) brighter stars group ( bsg ) , b ) fainter stars group ( fsg ) .",

    ", the probablity of the field stars in the stellar system is increased . in either case",
    ", the observed cmd must get deformed , thereby increasing the inaccuracy in estimation of the system parameters .",
    "therefore , we have considered the area of the field region as 90.29 @xmath44 which is equal to the area of the stellar system .",
    "our field region begins after the radial distance of 5.36 arcmin from the centre as shown in fig 1 .",
    "the field star decontamination is necessary for reducing the color - scattering on the cmds .",
    "the field stars are removed by comparing the magnitude and colour similarities of stars between the stellar system to the field region . based on the following criteria ,",
    "the stars are excluded from the stellar enhanced region :    * the obtained j - band magnitude difference between star in the system is not more than of 0.20 mag from the star of the field region at the same place in the cmd . *",
    "the colour difference ( @xmath45 ) of stars between system and field regions is not more than 0.05 mag . * similarly , the colour difference ( @xmath46 ) of stars between system and field regions is not more than 0.05 mag .",
    "we define a term @xmath47 which is the summation of color and magnitude differences of the field star and the star in the system , which fall within the grid of above specifications .",
    "we removed the star from the grid whose @xmath48 is minimum .",
    "after iterating the procedure for each field region star , we found 112 stars on the statistically cleaned cmds .",
    "the statistical approach depends on the color and magnitude grid size .",
    "if the boundaries of the grid size is increased , the system stars may get excluded from the membership of the stellar system and if the grid size is decreased , there is a possibility for the field stars to remain in the stellar system .",
    "thus , the optimum grid size is chosen in such a way that the main sequence pattern appears in the observed cmd .",
    "before the field star decontamination , no such pattern was visible while after the decontamination of the field stars , we see a clear main sequence pattern ( fig 4-b ) .",
    "* we noticed an almost vertical sequence of stars with @xmath49 and @xmath50 fainter than 13 mag in the @xmath51 decontamination cmd .",
    "this vertical sequence represents residual field star contamination .",
    "these residual field stars are removed from the decontaminated cmd by taking grid size as @xmath52 but exact cluster evolutionary sequence is not occurred in the decontaminated cmd ( fig 4-d ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the estimation of system parameters may not be possible , therefore , we have derived parameters through decontaminated cmd as obtained by applying the earlier grid size . *",
    "the limitation of this approach , however , is that the cluster characteristics depend on the size of the grid .",
    "the observed cmds of the stellar system are used to determine the model distance , age and reddening of the system by comparing them with the theoretical stellar isochrones . to test a suitable number of possible isochrone solutions , we first determined initial values for each physical parameter by visual inspection [ @xmath53 ] and subsequently we investigated a large parameter space in an iterative manner .",
    "our isochrone solutions typically span the physical ranges as @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we used the solar metallicity isochrones of log(age)=8.75 of @xmath56 photometric system @xcite in @xmath50 vs @xmath57 cmd ( fig 4-b ) . through these cmds",
    ", we found the apparent distance modulus of j - band i.e. @xmath58 , and log(age ) of the system as 12.06 mag , and 7.75 myr , respectively .",

    "the obtained age of stellar system is however higher than that of sparse ocs @xcite .",
    "the fiorucci & munari relations ( @xmath61 ) have been used to estimate the reddening i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath62 , which are estimated as 0.45 mag and 0.14 mag , respectively .",

    "the error in these values are estimated by considering the errors of fiorucci & munari relations .",
    "kharchenko et al .",
    "estimated the apparent distance modulus , reddening and distance as 12.6 mag , 0.56 mag and 3.05 kpc , respectively which is slightly different than our obtained values .",
    "two color diagrams are useful to derive the relationships among various colours .",
    "the color ratio , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are obtained as @xmath68 mag and @xmath69 mag , respectively and the resultant plots are shown in fig 5(a & b ) .",
    "the @xmath70 vs @xmath57 tcd are utilized to estimate the interstellar extinction in the near - ir .",

    "the mf slope value @xmath86 is found to be @xmath87 for the mass range from 2.44 @xmath88 to 0.85 @xmath88 which is low numerical value compared to the salpeter value [ salpeter gave the classical slope of -1.35 for the stars of mass range 0.4 @xmath88 to 10 @xmath88 ] and have positive slope .",
    "such flatness / positive value of mf slope may be due to the dynamical evolution , rather than the intrinsic difference in the initial mf @xcite .",
    "the stellar incompleteness increases toward the fainter end of photometric magnitude and consequently reduce the mf value thereby increasing the flatness of the mf slope .",
    "the mf values have also been computed for sample - b members of stellar system .",
    "the purpose of computing the mf values for sample - b members was to find out any correlation between mf values and the common stellar fraction of stars in various photometric regions .",

    "brighter stars are vital members to identify any cluster .",
    "however , even after the cleaning , the field stars may still be present in the fainter end .",
    "the mf value depends on the number of stellar members , hence the mf value should increase in presence of the residual field stars .",
    "however , the stellar incompleteness gives the opposite result , which is much effective and prominent compared to the effect of residual field stars .",
    "the corresponding mf slope value for sample - b is @xmath90 which is numerically comparable with the salpeter value but opposite in slope . since",
    ", the stars of sample - b are found in both 2mass and wise catalogues , the common stellar fraction of stars in both catalogues gradually decreases towards the end of fainter stars .",
    "due to the incompleteness of the data , in terms of the number of common stars , we expect the mf slope increases towards the positive slope value .      through the process of mass segregation ,",
    "the stellar encounters of the cluster members are gradually increased .",

    "we do not find any ms pattern on the observed cmd when the grid size is increased to @xmath100 which is less than the typical grid sizes of sparse clusters .",
    "thus the grid size did not provide any useful information about the ms characteristics of the stellar system .    using two different catalogues [ ppmxl @xcite and ucac4 @xcite ] , joshi et al . found that the proper motion of the oc ngc 559 is similar to each other within their given uncertainities . due to the low subtraction efficiency of the field decontamination procedure , the mean proper - motion of the system",

    "the stellar enhancement over the field region is clearly visible in the rdp of eso65sc03 and the enhancemnt in the sndp is only due to the brighter members of the system . since the sndps of the field and",

    "our photographic color - ratio values for the stellar system is less than the typical [ @xmath102 values found through ccd observations .",
    "the mass function value for the brighter stars is too low for the system to be an osc .",
    "however for stars with mass @xmath103 the mf slope is found to be @xmath87 indicating that most of the stars are evolved from the ms .",
    "the mf slope for the common stars between wise and 2-mass catalogue is @xmath90 which indicates that the mf slope increases towards the positive value due to the incompleteness effect .",
    "the system also shows the mass segregation phenomenon .",
    "the number of stars in the system are found to be about 6.5% more than that of the field region .",
