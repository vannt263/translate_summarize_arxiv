    "the newtonian @xmath2-body problem studies the motion of @xmath2 point masses moving in the euclidean space , under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction .",
    "the motion is determined by the system of differential equations : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the position and the mass of the i - th mass respectively .",
    "one of the difficulties in studying the @xmath1body problem is due to the large number of variables .",
    "therefore , sub - problems of the @xmath1body problem that have lower degrees of freedom , which are usually obtained by adding constraints on the configurations , have received considerable attention .",
    "two very popular examples are the collinear three - body problem and the isosceles three - body problem .",
    "on one hand , a well - known periodic orbit in the collinear three - body problem is the so called schubart orbit , formed by two equal masses @xmath6 and another mass @xmath7 , bouncing in between and having binary collisions with @xmath8 , @xmath9 alternatively .",
    "this orbit was numerically found by schubart  @xcite .",

    ", in the isosceles three - body problem , broucke found a symmetric periodic orbit  @xcite , called broucke orbit or a  schubart - like \" orbit , formed by two equal masses @xmath6 whose positions are symmetric with respect to a fixed axes , along with a third mass @xmath7 that is moving up and down on the axes . see table  [ orbits_table](a ) for the broucke orbit .",
    "broucke orbit has been proved to exist by shibayama  @xcite and martnez  @xcite separately .",
    "schubart - like\"(broucke ) orbit is similar to schubart orbit in the sense that in one period , they both have two singularities due to binary collisions , and that when a binary collision occurs , the third mass reaches its maximum distance to the origin .",
    "the motivation for this paper comes from the work of martnez  @xcite and chen  @xcite .",
    "martnez  @xcite studies certain hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom and provides sufficient conditions for the existence of doubly symmetric  schubart - like \" periodic orbits ( dssp orbits ) in these systems .",
    "these sufficient conditions are applied to three examples , namely the @xmath1pyramidal problem , the @xmath10-planar problem , and the double - polygon problem",
    ". however , the double - polygon problem fails one of these sufficient conditions .",
    "recently , martnez  @xcite extended her previous results .",
    "while the previously proved schubart - like orbits have only one singularity in a half period ( called 0-dssp orbits ) , the orbits in the new paper have a sufficiently large number of singularities in a half period ( called k - dssp orbits ) , yet the existence proof requires one hypothesis that is verified only for several values of @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "another six families of periodic orbits in the isosceles three - body problem are proved to be existed by using topological shooting arguments  @xcite .",
    "these are the so called brake orbits ; that is , these orbits have zero initial velocity .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the framework from  @xcite to the following three problems : the @xmath1pyramidal problem , the planar double - polygon problem , and the spatial double - polygon problem .",
    "see table  [ summary ] .",
    "first , the @xmath1pyramidal problem is a spatial problem which consists of @xmath2 masses whose configuration forms a planar regular @xmath1gon , along with an additional mass lying on the vertical axes crossing the center of the @xmath1gon .",
    "we remark that when @xmath11 , the @xmath1pyramidal problem is identical to the planar isosceles three - body problem .",
    "second , in the planar double - polygon problem , the configuration of the @xmath10 bodies forms two regular @xmath1gons in the plane .",
    "third , in the spatial double - polygon problem , the configuration of the @xmath10 bodies forms an anti - prism .",
    "we remark that the spatial double - polygon problem is a new example that has not appeared in  @xcite , and it is a special case of the dihedral n - body problem . the dihedral n - body problem is proposed by ferrario and portaluri in  @xcite , where they find all central configurations and compute the dimensions of the stable / unstable manifolds , while the existence of other periodic orbits , except for the relative equilibria , has not been studied .",
    "we prove the existence of several families of periodic orbits in the @xmath1pyramidal problem and the spatial double - polygon problem .",
    "representative orbits in the isosceles problem can be found in table  [ orbits_table ] . to picture orbits of the same types in other problems , for the @xmath1pyramidal problem",
    ", one may imagine replacing the two symmetric bodies in the isosceles problem with @xmath2 bodies lying on the vertices of a regular @xmath1gon ; for the spatial double - polygon problem , one furthermore replaces the third body with another @xmath2 bodies lying on the vertices of another regular @xmath1gon . as for the planar double - polygon problem , unfortunately , as in  @xcite , there are difficulties to apply our arguments . nonetheless , we complete martnez s existence proof for 0-dssp orbits , in which one of her three sufficient conditions fails , by showing that two of those conditions are enough to ensure the existence of 0-dssp orbits .",
    "existence of general k - dssp orbits for the planar double - polygon problem are not proved here and will require further work .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in table  [ summary ] .",
    "compared to martnez s work  @xcite , we have found new families of periodic orbits , and our proofs are significantly simplified ; we provide sufficient conditions that are looser and rigorously verified .",
    "moreover , while the orbits in @xcite must have either one or a sufficiently large number of singularities , we prove the existence of periodic orbits for any positive number of singularities in a half period .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces two coordinate systems , both of which will be used in our proofs .",
    "section 3 provides sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic brake orbits and schubart - like orbit ; it turns out that our sufficient conditions will be boiled down to the behaviours of two orbits .",
    "section 4 proves theorems about the two orbits just mentioned .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we apply our theorems to the three problems .",
