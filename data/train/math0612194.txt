    "the study of rota - baxter algebras was initiated by baxter in his works @xcite . the theory was later taken over by rota @xcite , who gave an explicit construction of free rota - baxter algebras and uncovered the relationship with symmetric functions . soon after cartier studied free rota - baxter algebras in @xcite . in the last few years",
    "the theory of rota - baxter algebras has received a great impulse , mainly because of its applications to renormalization , as formalized by connes and kreimer in @xcite .",
    "new techniques and applications of rota - baxter algebras have been found by an active group of researches in a number of important works , among which we cite just a few @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we consider the seemingly naive problem of writing an element of the form @xmath0 in a rota - baxter algebra as a linear combination of terms of the form @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 varying .",
    "the existence of such a linear combination is an immediate consequence of the rota - baxter identity satisfied by the operator @xmath5 .",
    "the actual problem is to determine the coefficients involved in such an expression as explicitly as possible .",
    "we provide a solution to this problem , and take a look at its meaning in a couple of rota - baxter algebras .",
    "we approach our problem from a rather pedestrian point of view using a graphical notation to illustrate our ideas .",
    "let us fix @xmath6 a field of characteristic zero .",
    "a rota - baxter algebra is a triple @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an associative @xmath6-algebra , @xmath9 is a constant in @xmath6 , and @xmath10 is a @xmath6-linear operator satisfying the identity @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "we find it convenient to use a graphical notation to express our results .",
    "we represent the product on @xmath8 by        and the rota - baxter operator by        the rota - baxter identity satisfied by @xmath5 is represented graphically by        for example using the graphical form of the rota - baxter identity one can see that        a further application of the graphical rota - baxter identity yields        thus we have shown that the following identity holds in any rota - baxter algebra : @xmath13    the symbol @xmath14 has two different meanings in this work :    * on the one hand it stands for the operator @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the product on @xmath8 . * on the other hand it represents the tree with @xmath17 dots on the left leg , @xmath18 dots on the right leg , and @xmath19 dots on the neck .",
    "the three @xmath14 is drawn as follows +     for example the three @xmath20 is represented graphically as follows :        it is clear from the graphical rota - baxter identity that each tree        can be written as a linear combination with coefficients in @xmath21 $ ] of trees of the form        indeed each application of the graphical rota - baxter relation replaces the tree        by the sum of trees        from an algorithmic point of view the graphical rota - baxter identity can be described as the application of three weighted moves :    1 .   a weight @xmath22 move where a dot from the left leg moves up .",
    "2 .   a weight @xmath22 move where a dot from the right leg moves up .",
    "3 .   a weight @xmath9 move where a couple of dots , one from the left leg and another one from the right leg , merge and move up as one dot .",
    "we are ready to formulate our main results .",
    "the case of rota - baxter algebras with @xmath24 simplifies considerably .",
    "we report on this special case because of its applications and elegant proof .",
    "[ hi]_let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be integers .",
    "the following identity holds in any rota - baxter algebra @xmath27 _    we justify only the left summand ,",
    "the right summand is justified in an analogous way . for @xmath28 only move 1 and move 2 are allowed . with each move a dot from one of the legs moves up .",
    "suppose that after applying several times the rota - baxter identity to @xmath14 we arrive at a tree of the form @xmath29 .",
    "then a total of @xmath30 dots from the legs have moved up so @xmath31 . necessarily",
    "the last dot moving up comes from the left leg .",
    "the other dots moved up in an arbitrary order , so this explain the factor @xmath32    consider the rota - baxter algebra @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the algebra of continuous functions on @xmath35 and @xmath5 is the riemann integral operator given by @xmath36 for real numbers @xmath37 and @xmath38 let @xmath39 be the convex polytope @xmath40 for @xmath41 we let @xmath42 be the volume of @xmath43 by convention we set @xmath44 it is easy to check that @xmath45 theorem [ hi ] implies the following result .",
    "now we considerer the generic situation , i.e. , a rota - baxter algebra with @xmath48 .",
    "[ fi ]    _ let @xmath49 and @xmath26 be integers .",
    "the following identity holds in any rota - baxter algebra : @xmath50 where @xmath51 _    and @xmath52    notice that with each move a dot is added to the neck . if starting from the tree @xmath53 we arrive using the allowed moves to the graph @xmath54 , then necessarily we must have applied @xmath4 moves and the last move must have been either move @xmath22 or move @xmath55 .",
    "let us consider the case were the last move is of type @xmath22 .",
    "the other @xmath56 moves are distributed into @xmath57 moves of type @xmath22 , @xmath58 moves of type @xmath59 , and @xmath60 moves of type @xmath55 , given rise to the combinatorial number @xmath61 the numbers @xmath62 and @xmath60 are subject to the constrains @xmath63 solving this linear system of equations we find that @xmath64 this justifies the expression for @xmath65 from the statement of the theorem .",
    "we proceed to justify the expression for @xmath66 which arises when the last move taken in the path towards @xmath29 is of type @xmath55 .",
    "the remaining new @xmath56 dots in the neck move up as consequence of the application of any of the moves , giving rise to the factor @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath60 are subject to the constraints @xmath69 solving this equations we find that @xmath70 thus we have justified the factor @xmath71 appearing in the formula for @xmath66 . the formula for @xmath72 and @xmath73 are derived in a fairly similar way .",
    "let us consider the formula for @xmath74 in this case the last move is necessarily of type @xmath55 and gives rise to the factor @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath60 satisfy the constrains @xmath75 we find that @xmath76 which justifies the factor @xmath77 appearing in the formula for @xmath78",
