    "the structure of the nucleus and the properties of extended nuclear systems strongly depend on their possible superfluid nature . in finite nuclei ,",

    "this encompasses masses , separation energies , deformation , individual excitation spectra and collective excitation modes such as rotation or vibration .",
    "the role of pairing correlations is particularly emphasized when going toward the drip - lines .",
    "this is due to the proximity of the fermi surface to the single - particle continuum .",
    "indeed , the scattering of virtual pairs into the continuum gives rise to a variety of new phenomena as regards the properties of ground and excited states of nuclei  @xcite .    in neutron stars , a good description of pairing",
    "is also required .",
    "the neutron - neutron @xmath0 pairing drives the physics of neutron star crusts , while at higher densities , that is from the inner crust to two or three times the saturation density , neutron and proton pairing occur dominantly in the @xmath3 and @xmath0 channels , respectively  @xcite .",
    "such superfluid phases influence the dynamical and thermal evolution of the star .",
    "indeed , post - glitching timing observations  @xcite and the cooling history  @xcite strongly depend on the presence or absence of pairing in the system .    to treat pairing",
    ", one needs to specify the many - body technique used and the appropriate interaction to insert into the calculation at that chosen level of approximation .",
    "the latter depends on the situation and on the system . in the present case ,",
    "our aim is eventually to perform non - relativistic self - consistent mean - field and beyond - mean - field calculations in finite nuclei .",
    "mean - field calculations are of the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) type , while the considered beyond - mean - field calculations deal typically with symmetry restorations ( projected mean field method ) and with large amplitude motion in nuclei ( generator coordinate method )  @xcite .",
    "thus , one has to identify the appropriate vertices to be used in each of these cases .",
    "the same question arises for instance in the context of the shell model  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the mean - field treatment . while the variational derivation of the hfb equations can not help in defining the appropriate vertex , the green function or goldstone formalisms are able to do so .",
    "such many - body theories show unambiguously that the irreducible vertex to be used in the pairing channel at lowest order is the bare nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force  @xcite . at the next order ,",
    "the irreducible pairing vertex involves the so - called polarization diagrams .",
    "this situation is in contrast to the particle - hole channel where one can not avoid regularizing the repulsive core of the bare interaction from the outset through the definition of an in - medium two - body matrix .",
    "this stresses the fact that the effective forces in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels are different .",
    "in particular , the direct use in the gap equation of an in - medium vertex such as the brueckner @xmath4-matrix leads to double counting  @xcite .",
    "thus , the mean - field energy defined in this context is a functional of one - body normal and abnormal density matrices and do not refer to the mean value of a given hamiltonian in a product state .",
    "however , the strategy used consists of motivating the low - energy functional from a many - body expansion and thus , consists of keeping an explicit link to the bare @xmath5 force . with this approach ,",
    "the theory is not necessarily local and the mean - field functional does not include more correlations than provided by the irreducible vertices in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels .",
    "also , one has to come back to the many - body expansion to enrich the functional if going beyond the mean - field approach  @xcite . even if the final goal is the same , this differs from the strategy used in the so - called ( local ) density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "note also that calculations based on the extension of gorkov s formalism to the relativistic case are also performed  @xcite .",
    "recently , the effects of polarization leading to the screening of nucleon and meson propagators have been studied in infinite matter  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the gap was found to be much larger than in the non - relativistic case , correcting to some extent for the excessive gap found at first order .    as regards hfb calculations in finite nuclei ,",
    "only phenomenological forces have been used in the spin - singlet / isospin - triplet pairing channel so far .",
    "one example is the finite - range , density - independent gogny force  @xcite , whose restriction to the spin - singlet / isospin triplet channel can be written as :    @xmath6    and is to be averaged over the angle between the incoming and outgoing relative momenta if dealing with the @xmath7 wave only . in eq .",
    "[ gogny ] , @xmath8 is the spin - exchange operator while the coulomb part of the gogny force has not been considered .",

    "the latter , usually used when solving the problem in coordinate space , must be complemented with a cut - off in the gap equation to avoid divergences .",
    "studies of the rotational bands of super - deformed nuclei  @xcite and actinides  @xcite , of halo nuclei  @xcite , and of the evolution of charge radii across magic numbers  @xcite have helped to establish the success and the surface - peaked character of the dddi in the pairing channel .",
    "recently , more systematic studies of asymptotic matter and pair densities of exotic nuclei  @xcite , of the evolution of the pairing gap toward the neutron drip - line  @xcite , and the average behavior of the odd - even mass differences over the mass table  @xcite have allowed a refinement of the dddi .",
    "the optimal compatibility between experimental data and mean - field calculations was obtained for a force between surface and volume  @xcite , with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 = 0.16 @xmath13 is the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the great sensitivity of matter and pair densities to pairing in the low - density regime seemed to favor @xmath14 .",
    "although successful in describing low - energy nuclear structure over the ( known ) mass table  @xcite , the two previous phenomenological pairing interactions lack a link to the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "they were directly fitted to finite nuclei data , and may thus renormalize beyond - mean - field effects .",
    "in addition , their fits were performed where experimental data are available .",
    "extrapolating the use of these interactions toward the drip - lines is questionable . to correct for this defect",
    ", few dddi were fitted to reproduce the gap provided by realistic @xmath5 forces in infinite matter  @xcite .",
    "however , the necessary density dependence and cut - off were still treated phenomenologically .",
    "in fact , the present knowledge about the pairing force and the nature of pairing correlations in nuclei is quite poor .",
    "properties such as the range of the effective pairing interaction , its link to the bare force , its possible surface character in finite nuclei and its density dependence , in particular isovector , still have to be clarified . as noticed as early as thirty years ago  @xcite and pointed out several times since  @xcite , obtaining proper density dependences of particle - hole and particle - particle effective forces at a given level of approximation",
    "is difficult but of great importance to meet modern high - precision experiments .",
    "the problem dealing with the cut - off to be used in the pairing channel in connection with zero - range vertices has been solved recently  @xcite .",
    "the idea was to identify the divergences stemming from the use of a local gap and regularize them through a well - defined renormalization scheme .",
    "that scheme has to be understood in the context of the local density functional theory  @xcite ( which is perfectly fine ) rather than as a mean - field approximation arising at lowest order of some many - body expansion .",
    "the present work concentrates on the mean - field treatment of pairing at relatively low energy and low density in the isotropic , spin - singlet and isospin - triplet channel .",
    "the aim of this study is manifold . in section  [ definition1 ] , we define an appropriate simple version of the bare force in the @xmath0 channel and explain in details its fitting procedure . then , an in - medium pairing interaction ( eq .",
    "[ effectv ] ) equivalent to the bare force is introduced in section  [ formalism ] .",
    "the corresponding diagrammatic resummation authorizes the study of the finite - ranged effective force and of its zero - range approximation on the same footing .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ infinitematter ] where the roles of the range and of the density dependence of the pairing interaction are disentangled . in the particular case of the zero - range approximation for the vertex ,",
    "the scheme proposed presents strong similarities with the regularization procedure introduced in refs .",
    "we will actually discuss this particular point in a forthcoming publication .",
    "ultimately , the interaction is to be used in calculations performed in coordinate space by solving the hfb equations on a three dimensional mesh  @xcite .",
    "although finite ranged and non local , the proposed interaction is shown in section  [ interactionrealspace ] to make these calculations tractable .",
    "the formulas defining completely the new effective pairing force can be found in the same section .",
    "some important points are discussed in section  [ discussion ] while our conclusions are given in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "screening effects beyond the mean - field approximation due to density and spin fluctuations are known to strongly decrease the pairing gap in neutron matter , both for singlet and triplet pairing  @xcite . whether it is justified to extend this statement to finite nuclei",
    "is still an open question .",
    "indeed , the dressing of the vertex could change significantly when going from neutron matter to symmetric matter  @xcite .",
    "also , including the induced interaction and off - shell self - energy effects due to the exchange of surface vibrations between time - reversed states seems to increase the pairing gap in finite nuclei compared to that generated by the bare force  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the influence of the restoration of particle - number and pairing vibrations still have to be characterized from systematic self - consistent calculations in even and odd nuclei . the situation",
    "as regards beyond - mean - field effects is unclear at this stage and one can simply state that a significant cancellation between the effects of screening and of surface vibrations on singlet pairing should take place in finite nuclei . as a result ,",
    "two strategies seem reasonable when dealing with the definition of a pairing interaction to be used in mean - field calculations .    sticking to the pure mean - field picture",
    ", one can define the interaction by reproducing properties of the bare @xmath5 interaction .",
    "if necessary , the possibility remains to include beyond - mean - field effects explicitly in a consistent way when using an interaction mimicking the bare force .",
    "a second strategy consists of fitting the interaction directly to finite nuclei data through mean - field calculations  @xcite .",
    "this strategy has been the most popular so far when dealing with phenomenological forces to be used in self - consistent hartree - fock - bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( hfbcs ) and hfb calculations  @xcite .",
    "such a procedure aims at renormalizing the beyond - mean - field effects which possibly do not cancel out .",
    "of course , the use of such a force in calculations going explicitly beyond the mean - field is suspicious .    as a first attempt , and",
    "because we want to separate mean - field from beyond - mean - field effects , we follow the first strategy . note",
    "that no isospin symmetry breaking effects due to coulomb or charge - independence breaking of the nuclear part of the interaction is considered in the present study .",
    "it was shown to have no effect on the gap in the @xmath15 channel  @xcite .",
    "also , we do not consider the neutron - proton component of the force in this channel .",
    "as already said , the bare @xmath5 interaction has to be considered in the pairing channel at lowest order in irreducible vertices .",
    "however , the full complexity of any realistic @xmath5 force makes systematic hfb calculations in finite nuclei untractable from the computational point of view .",
    "we thus have to define a simplified bare force retaining the essential physics provided by the full @xmath5 interaction as regards pairing .",
    "a particular feature of the @xmath5 force in the @xmath0 channel is the corresponding very large , negative scattering length .",
    "the empirical values for neutron - neutron , neutron - proton and proton - proton scattering length are @xmath17  @xcite ( @xmath18 in a recent experiment  @xcite ) , @xmath19  @xcite and @xmath20  @xcite respectively .",

    "a matrix element with no subscript is neither symmetrized nor antisymmetrized .",
    "the isospin quantum number has not been specified since the form of the matrix elements in the @xmath34 channels is trivial .",

    "one could use a rank - two separable form to take care of this  @xcite .",
    "however , an overall reproduction of the phase shifts up to @xmath53 should be sufficient to describe pairing at relatively low density .",
    "indeed , the kernel of the gap equation is strongly peaked at @xmath54 .",
    "the inverse scattering problem , which corresponds to the determination of a two - particle potential from the knowledge of the phase shifts at all energies , is exactly and uniquely solvable for rank - one separable potentials  @xcite .",
    "thus , given the phase shifts , a unique solution exists for @xmath55 .",
    "we do not proceed however through the resolution of the inverse scattering problem .",

    "we consider the gaussian form :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the second parameter of the force . this choice will be shown later to be appropriate .",
    "we have introduced a simple force to mimic the realistic @xmath5 interaction in the @xmath15 channel .",
    "starting from this interaction defined in the vacuum , one can go to the medium and compute the pairing gap through the bcs gap equation  @xcite .",
    "this scheme corresponds to the lowest order in the goldstone - brueckner - bogolyubov perturbation theory  @xcite , or in the galitskii - gorkov green function method  @xcite , and defines a meaningful mean - field picture .",

    "the reduction is slightly too small in symmetric matter , especially at low density  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to isoscalar and isovector parts of the effective mass which are respectively too large and too small . in any case , the global effect is present at the densities of interest .",
    "this should be sufficient to discuss the effects of the self - energy on the effective pairing interaction .    the modified functions @xmath209 and @xmath210 have been re - calculated for neutron and symmetric matter .",

    "therefore , one can safely state that the vertex only depends on the density of the interacting nucleons @xmath211/2 $ ] and is not influenced by the surrounding nucleons of the other species .",
    "this result offers a microscopic answer to the issue dealing with the isovector density dependence of the effective pairing force at the mean - field level .",
    "a dependence on the total density as used so far is not justified from the microscopic point of view .",

    "one single approximation dealing with the @xmath164 dependence of @xmath233 was performed in section  [ infinitematter ] .",
    "thus , eq .  [ 2bodyrealspace3 ] clarifies why the approximate dependence on @xmath164 was needed in order to write the effective pairing interaction in coordinate space .",
    "note that the parameters of the force have been fixed in infinite matter and that no room is left for any adjustment in finite systems .",
    "it is worth characterizing the physical content of the lda used for the function @xmath209 in eq .",
    "[ 2bodyrealspace1 ] .",
    "the particle - particle and hole - hole ladders ( including all high energy processes ) associated with two - body _ scattering _ in the medium are resummed in the effective interaction by considering the nucleus as slices of homogeneous , infinite nuclear matter .",
    "however , the scattering of pairs around the fermi surface responsible for the formation of the _ bound states _ in the medium are treated explicitly in the finite system through the resolution of the hfb equations .",
    "also , the quantum shell effects which strongly influence the latter pair scatterings are taken into account explicitly .",
    "all along the way , the finite range and the non - locality of the interaction is fully considered .",
    "we expect the local approximation for the correlations associated with two - body scattering to satisfactory and the inclusion of gradient terms to improve on it to be rather unnecessary  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the lda is performed on the effective vertex itself makes the present approximation different from a so - called semi - classical treatment  @xcite or from the local density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has allowed us to derive fine details of the interaction , such as its non - analytical low - density or isovector character , which are otherwize difficult to identify by looking directly at total - energy differences because of our presently limited experimental knowledge  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important properties of the newly defined pairing interaction can be identified by calculating its antisymmetrized matrix elements in any given single - particle basis . to be explicit ,",
    "we define a basis @xmath234 where @xmath235 denote the principal quantum number , the parity , the z - signature and the isospin of the state , respectively .",

    "solving the hfb problem in coordinate space is a nice feature since it allows a natural treatment of all kinds of deformations and is well suited to describe exotic systems for which asymptotic properties of individual wave - functions and densities must be considered carefully .",
    "however , the naive use of a finite - range interaction in this context is numerically prohibitive  @xcite . indeed , solving the bcs gap equation is too costly for practical applications , while the hfb problem takes the form of a coupled set of integro - differential equations , also untractable for systematic studies .",
    "this is the main reason why zero - range forces have been extensively used so far  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of our finite - range , non - local effective pairing - interaction look very similar to those obtained from a zero - range force  @xcite . the only additional cost is to replace the single - particle wave - functions @xmath236 by their convoluted counterpart as defined through eq .",
    "[ 2bodyrealspace5 ] .",
    "this property makes the corresponding hfb problem in ( 3-dimensions ) coordinate space tractable through the two - basis method  @xcite , and almost equivalent computationally to the use of a local , zero - range force .",

    "of course , the pairing field provided by our force is non local .",

    "of course , this statement is no longer valid when going to higher orders , when renormalizing the effect of the three - body force  @xcite or when using the philosophy of the density functional theory .    as an alternative to our finite - range and non - local microscopic effective vertex",
    ", one can use its zero - range approximation studied in section  [ zerorange ] .",
    "when performing the zero - range limit appropriately , the convolution used in eq .  [ 2bodyrealspace5 ] becomes the identity operation .",

    "while very low - densities are not essential for stable nuclei , they become increasingly important when going to exotic systems . indeed ,",
    "nuclei close to the neutron drip - line develop extended low - density halos or skins where pairing correlations play a crucial role .",
    "this is also true in neutron stars crust .",
    "thus , the behavior of the pairing force at low density is of great interest for the study of these systems .",
    "it is clear that usual dddi miss the very low - density part of @xmath189 discussed in section  [ zerorange ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite , strongly increasing interactions at low density were simulated through small exponents @xmath247 in eq .  [ dddi ] .",
    "such pairing interactions were disregarded , notably because of the unrealistic reduction of the two - neutron separation energy across the magic number @xmath248 .",
    "however , these interactions were used together with a phenomenological cut - off at a maximal fixed energy in the single - particle spectrum . in the present case ,",
    "the cut - off @xmath2 derived in connection with the density dependence will weight the low - density content of the force in a very different way .",
    "also , the isovector character of the pairing force should manifest itself when studying drip - lines systems .",
    "the dependence of our force on the density of the interacting nucleons will provide a weaker pairing when going toward the drip - lines than standard dddi depending on the total density and adjusted around the valley of stability .",
    "one can expect these properties of the force to significantly influence matter densities , pair densities , individual excitation spectra , low - energy vibrational collective modes , rotational properties and the odd - even mass differences in exotic nuclei as well as the position of the neutron drip - line .",
    "it was shown that the pairing gap is extremely sensitive to the details of the force when dealing with neutron rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "also , while the position of the proton drip - line appears to be quite robust , the position of the neutron drip - line was shown to be shifted by up to 25 mass units depending on whether the so - called volume or surface pairing force was used  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the achievements of the present work to propose a pairing interaction whose ab - initio derivation should make its extrapolated use to exotic systems reliable and subject to less uncertainty .    at the mean - field level , this ab - initio character deals with the bare force .",
    "this is the first essential piece since , unlike for normal superconductors in condensed matter , the bare nn force provides pairing between the constituents of the nucleus .",
    "however , the question arises of its contribution compared to the pairing generated by collective effects .",
    "recently , the bcs gap provided by the realistic @xmath1 @xmath5 force was shown to account for only half of the experimental odd - even mass staggering in @xmath249  @xcite .",
    "this was interpreted as a necessity to go beyond the mean - field to introduce the off - shell nucleon propagation associated with the particle - vibration coupling and the induced interaction generated by the exchange of the same surface vibrations between time - reversed states . including those processes , the experimental odd - even mass staggering",
    "was reproduced in @xmath249  @xcite .",
    "this exchange of surface vibrations should provide the effective pairing force with an additional surface - peaked character and some isospin dependence due to the appearance of new vibrational modes toward the neutron drip - line . on the other hand , the same category of diagrams",
    "is known to decrease the gap in the bulk  @xcite ; even if the corresponding dressing of the vertex could change significantly when going from neutron matter to symmetric matter  @xcite .",
    "the latter would add up another dependence of the interaction on the nuclear asymmetry .",
    "thus , the situation concerning the net influence of beyond - mean - field effects on pairing in finite nuclei is unclear .",
    "let us repeat that , as already discussed in section  analysis , calculations performed with the gogny interaction enforce the idea that medium renormalizations on top of the bare force in the @xmath250 channel should not be that large when going to finite systems .",
    "however , one has to consider to more elements before concluding .",
    "first , the effect of three - body force on pairing should be treated if one works with microscopic interactions as proposed here .",
    "the three - body force has been shown to decrease the gap in infinite matter non - negligibly for @xmath251  @xcite . including the three - body force in the pairing channel",
    "could also be necessary to reproduce delicate phenomena such as the odd - even staggering and the kinks of differential charge radii  @xcite .",
    "second , one has to include the coulomb force in the proton - proton pairing channel . from the comparison between proton - proton and neutron - neutron scattering phase - shifts in the @xmath0 channel  @xcite , one would not expect a strong anti - pairing effect from the coulomb interaction .",
    "this is particularly true since the very low energy regime where the coulomb force is active does not seem to matter so much when dealing with pairing as discussed in section  [ results ] .",
    "however , it was shown that the self - consistency of the hfb calculations makes the coulomb anti - pairing effect quite significant in finite nuclei  @xcite .    thus , pairing",
    "correlations and details of the effective pairing interaction are far from being understood in nuclei .",
    "systematic microscopic calculations including all previously mentioned effects are required .",
    "however , this is unconceivable in finite nuclei at this stage . as a first step , performing systematic hfb calculations with our effective interaction offers a unique opportunity to understand in detail the contribution of the bare force to pairing in nuclei .",
    "let us now discuss the range of the effective pairing force .",
    "indeed , it would be nice to have an interaction allowing for large scale microscopic calculations of nuclear masses  @xcite . performing self - consistent mean - field or beyond - mean - field calculations",
    ", the size of the single - particle basis necessary to get converged results should be as small as possible to make such large scale calculations tractable .",
    "the required size is directly related to the range of the force in the pairing channel .",
    "for instance the shorter range of the gogny force ( @xmath252 ) makes the convergence of the quantities related to pairing quite slow .",
    "one needs to include states up to @xmath253 in the quasi - particle spectrum to do so  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ comparisonvlowk ] that our effective interaction is softer than the gogny force .",
    "the range to be compared with the @xmath252 of gogny is in the present case @xmath254 .",
    "this translates into a kinetic energy of about @xmath255 which , once the depth of the single - particle potential has been subtracted ( @xmath256 ) , gives a value of the order of @xmath257 . taking the effect of the cut - off @xmath242 in the gap equation into account , it should be sufficient to include single - particle states up to @xmath258 of positive energy in the canonical basis to get converged hfb calculations .",
    "thus , this pairing interaction should be simple and soft enough to perform large scale calculations of nuclear masses , avoiding at the same time the problem related to the phenomenological choice of the cut - off dealing with the zero range of the dddi  @xcite . checking",
    "this statement is the aim of a forthcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "note that the induced interaction is expected to be long ranged  @xcite .",
    "once the softness of the pairing interaction has been established , it will be important to understand the significance of the range and the non - locality of the force and whether it needs to be treated explicitly in nuclei .",
    "it amounts to studying the influence of the non - locality of the pairing field .",
    "being able to use the microscopic non - local finite - range interaction and a gap - equivalent local zero - range force within a single scheme offers a unique opportunity to answer such a question  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a microscopic effective interaction to describe pairing in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "the new features of the interaction are numerous .",
    "it possesses a clear link to the bare force .",
    "the effective interaction provides the same pairing properties as the bare force at the mean - field level , as required from many - body theories .",
    "the gap at the fermi energy obtained in infinite matter from the realistic av18 interaction is perfectly reproduced by the new force .",
    "going into further detail , the momentum dependence of the gap is also very well described in the density range of interest .",
    "the effective force is finite ranged , non local , total - momentum dependent and density dependent .",
    "while the effective interaction is almost constant for densities ranging from saturation to typical surface densities , it is strongly enhanced at very low density .",
    "the isoscalar and isovector density dependences of the pairing force are also obtained through the ab - initio derivation .",
    "while phenomenological density - dependent pairing interactions used so far depend on the total density , the one derived here depends on the density of the interacting nucleons only ( i.e. protons _ or _",
    "neutrons since the present work deals with like - particle pairing only ) .",
    "this effective pairing force is defined by recasting the gap equation written in terms of the bare force into a fully equivalent pairing problem . through this rewriting procedure , the matrix elements of the effective force are provided with a natural cut - off @xmath2 , where @xmath259 is a bcs occupation number .",
    "this makes the definition of zero - range approximations meaningful and no ad - hoc cut - off has to be additionally chosen and optimized .",
    "performing such a zero - range approximation and asking for identical pairing gaps at the fermi surface in infinite matter , the appropriate density - dependence of the zero - range force is obtained .",
    "this procedure , free of any phenomenological cut - off allows us to disentangle the roles played by the range and the density dependence of the pairing interaction .",
    "surprisingly , the enhancement of the force at typical surface densities as compared to the saturation density is much more pronounced than for the finite range vertex .",
    "this result shows unambiguously that the surface character of usual zero - range forces is , to a large extent , a way of taking care of the range of the interaction .",
    "precisely , the zero - range vertex is predicted to have a behavior between surface and volume .",
    "it also undergoes a large increase of its intensity at very low density .",
    "the last essential feature of the force can be identified when going from infinite matter to finite nuclei . indeed , dealing with a finite - range and non - local interaction",
    "is far from being trivial when solving the hfb equations in coordinate space .",
    "however , the particular analytical structure of our effective force makes such calculations possible within the so - called two - basis method .",
