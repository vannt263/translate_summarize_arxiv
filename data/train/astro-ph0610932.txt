    "we report a phase - coherent timing solution that spans the post - gap ( _ i.e. _ after 2000 ) 6-yr period up until february 2006 ( mjd  53787 ) including all data in _ rxte _ cycles 5@xmath310 .",

    "however , by using 6 frequency derivatives , we found a possible ephemeris that fits the entire cycle  1 to cycle  10 range ( see table  [ table1 ] , figure  [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "the existence of our overall ephemeris can not rule out the possibility of the glitch having occured in 1999  @xcite : if a fully recovered glitch with a short relaxation time occured in the _ rxte / pca _ observing gap between cycles 3 and 5 , only a random phase jump would be observed . to investigate this",
    ", we added an arbitrary but constant time jump to all the post - gap toas .",
    "we were still able to find a new ephemeris that connected the toas through the two - year gap .",
    "this indicates that our overall ephemeris is not unique .",
    "hence , we can not rule out the possibility of a phase jump between cycles  3 and  5 , and therefore a glitch in 1999 can not be ruled out .",
    "however , it is also not required by the data .",
    "indeed , the frequency of the discrepant _ asca _ observation reported by  @xcite is consistent with the frequency predicted by the overall ephemeris shown in table  1 to within 2@xmath30 .",
    "10 , 2@xmath34 , and 6@xmath38  kev . in a given band ,",
    "the different profile qualities are due to different net exposure times .",
    "the cycle number is shown in the top right corner of each plot . ]        to search for pulse profile changes , the phase - aligned profiles were averaged for each _ rxte _ cycle .",
    "this was done in three energy bands .",
    "the average profiles in all bands are presented in figure  [ figure4 ] .",
    "the ratios of the fourier amplitudes of the pulse profiles in all bands as a function of _ rxte _ cycle are presented in figure  [ figure5 ] . in figure",
    "[ figure4 ] , the pulse profile changes are clear : for 2@xmath310 and 2@xmath34  kev , in cycles  1 and  2 , the smaller peak is not well defined .",
    "after the two - year gap , in cycle  5 , the dip between the peaks is much more pronounced .",
    "the peaks start to merge back in subsequent cycles almost as if the profile is recovering to its original morphology . in 6@xmath38",
    "kev , the smaller peak is not as obvious , indicating that it has a softer spectrum relative to the larger peak . given the spectrum of the source ( see  @xcite ) , which is fitted to a two - component model consisting of power law and thermal emission , the 2@xmath34  kev band includes both thermal and power - law photons while the 6@xmath38  kev band contains negligibly few thermal photons . in figure",
    "[ figure5 ] , the fact that the ratio of the harmonics is dropping only in 2@xmath34  kev suggests that only the thermal component of the spectrum is evolving .",
    "10  kev band . ]    for each observation , the pulsed flux , f@xmath31 ( in counts / s / pcu ) , was calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squares of the deviations from the mean number of counts in the pulse profile .",
    "we omitted pcu  0 from this analysis because of the uncertainties in its response due to the loss of the propane layer .",
    "the pulsed flux series for 4u  0142 + 61 shows a slow but steady increase since 2000 in 2@xmath310  kev ( see fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ) .",
    "there are hints that the change is also present in 2@xmath34  kev and not in 6@xmath38  kev but our statistics do not let us confirm this .",
    "we verified there are no comparable trends in the long - term light curves of the other axps observed as part of this monitoring program . from  @xcite , increases in the twist angle of the field lines in the magnetosphere can cause luminosity increases as well as pulse profile changes .",
    "it is tempting to also attribute the increase in the pulsed flux of this source to an increase in the twist angle .",
    "however , @xcite also predict that an increase in the twist angle is accompanied by an increase in the spin down rate , which is not what we are currently observing : in the post - gap ephemeris presented in table  1 , @xmath2 is positive , i.e. the magnitude of the spin down rate is _ de_creasing .",
    "thus , another explanation is needed .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that in april  2006 , after the last _ rxte _ cycle included in this analysis , the pulsar appears to have entered an extended active phase : a single burst accompanied by a pulse profile change was detected from the pulsar on april  06  @xcite .",
    "a series of four bursts was later detected on june  25  @xcite .",
