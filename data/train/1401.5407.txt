    "commercial shipping provides enormous economic benefits worldwide and is responsible for approximately 90% of global trade .",
    "however , shipping also imparts large economic and environmental costs by spreading invasive species , or those non - indigenous species ( nis ) that damage ecological systems .",
    "shipping can translocate nis to new areas either through ballast water or hull - fouling , and is responsible for 69% of known aquatic nis @xcite .",
    "although only a small portion of transported nis establish and become invasive , their environmental and economic damages are often large and grow over time  @xcite .",
    "for instance , we recently estimated that ship - borne aquatic invasive species cost the great lakes regional economy $ 100800 million annually  @xcite .",
    "this high cost of ship - born invasions has motivated several efforts to better understand nis spread and invasion risk through the global shipping network ( gsn )  @xcite .",
    "these studies used ship traffic data to create a _ network _ , where _ nodes _",
    "( i.e. , ports ) are connected by _",
    "edges _ that represent the intensity of shipping traffic .",
    "such networks have been shown to have _ small - world _",
    "@xcite characteristics , wherein each port is linked to any other port by a small number of `` hops ''  @xcite , and to be very robust with many redundant links  @xcite .",
    "while such initial network analyses are enlightening , they are ultimately inadequate because ship traffic can not sufficiently capture nis invasion risk .",
    "rather , invasion risk is likely affected by a complex interplay of ship traffic , ballast uptake / discharge dynamics , survival during transport , propagule pressure , environmental variables , biotic interactions and several other variables that are not yet well characterized  @xcite .",
    "incorporating these complexities is a challenging task , since majority of the above relationships and their parameterizations are poorly known .",
    "the few studies that have attempted to calculate more realistic measures of invasion risk have relied on probabilistic models that make several simplifying assumptions . for example ,  @xcite combined ship traffic and environmental similarity to estimate relative invasion risk , assuming that simple euclidean distance between ports mean annual temperature and salinity was proportional to risk .",
    "this linear relationship between risk and changes in temperature and salinity is not likely for most species , particularly invasive species who tend to exhibit broad environmental tolerances .",
    "most recently ,  @xcite calculated between - port invasion risk as the product of three probabilities  the probability a species was non - native ( based on geographic distance ) , the probability a species survived transport ( based on trip duration ) , and the probability a species establishes ( based on euclidean environmental similarity ) .",
    "the benefits of these probabilistic approaches are that they provide quantitative estimates .",
    "their drawbacks include unjustifiable simplifying assumptions ( i.e. , establishment proportional to euclidean distance , linear propagules pressure  invasion risk relationships ) , high uncertainty , and inability to incorporate `` stepping - stone '' invasion probabilities .",
    "the graph analysis methods popularized by network science are excellent tools for our goals , as they provide some of the most elegant tools for descriptive analysis of complex , relational data , and they are able to reveal large - scale patterns from a higher level , which is not easily affected by small uncertainties in data .",
    "specifically , we 1 ) create a network that represents the general species flow tendency among ports , 2 ) identify _ clusters _ , or groups of ports , in which intense species flow tightly connect the ports in the same cluster , while connections between different clusters are loose , 3 ) identify ports and ship types that serve as important `` inter - cluster connectors '' , 4 ) develop flexible methods to qualitatively assess invasion risk within a cluster based on realistic biogeographic and environmental relationships , and 5 ) highlight the management implications of our results .",
    "we focus here on the spread of species via ballast water , but the method could be easily applied to hull - fouling spread with a few adjustments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : mat_methods ] presents the materials and methods describing the formulation of species flow networks using limited available data , graph clustering approach for understanding the large - scale dynamics of gsn , and an intuitive method that extends graph clustering notions for detailed risk analysis using ecoregion and environmental conditions ; section  [ sec : results_discuss ] presents the results and provides a detailed discussion ; and finally , section  [ sec : conc ] contains the concluding remarks .",
    "our main goal is to understand the large - scale ( or coarse - grained ) patterns of gsn in order to obtain better insight towards ship - borne nis invasions .",
    "the presented approach is developed in order to exploit the power of network analysis methods in extracting knowledge from largely incomplete data with minimal simplifications and assumptions .",
    "we proceed as follows : a network that represents the general species flow tendency among ports is built ; then , utilizing a graph clustering method  @xcite that operates on the basis of flow - dynamics , a _ map _  @xcite of the species flow network , i.e. , a cogent representation that extracts the main structure of flow while retaining information about relationships among modules ( of main structure ) , is built ; finally , using this map that summarizes the species flow dynamics in terms of _ clusters _ ( or groups ) of ports and highlights _ inter - cluster _",
    "( i.e. , between clusters ) and _ intra - cluster _",
    "( i.e. , within cluster ) relationships , the impact of gsn dynamics on nis invasions is studied in conjunction with ecological and environmental aspects that govern the species establishment .",
    "let us now illustrate this innovative approach in detail .",
    "global and domestic vessel movements for four ( 4 ) periods of 19971998 , 19992000 , 20022003 and 20052006 , totaling @xmath0 individual voyages corresponding to a total of @xmath1 vessels of various types that move between a total of @xmath2 ports and regions , are acquired from lloyd s maritime intelligence unit ( lmiu ) . for each period , the lmiu database contains travel information for vessels such as portid , sail_date and arrival_date , along with vessel metadata , such as vessel_type and dwt ( i.e. , dead weight tonnage ) , etc .",
    "since vessel movement data ( including lmiu ) does not provide explicit ballast water exchange amounts ( or even whether a vessel dis / charged ballast water ) , these quantities must be estimated based on some auxiliary data that can sufficiently relate ballast discharge to vessel information given in the lmiu database .",
    "therefore , we utilize the approach suggested in  @xcite , where ballast water discharge amounts are calculated using a linear regression model per vessel_type basis . for this , the national ballast water clearinghouse ( nbic ) database , which contains the date and discharge_volume of all ships visiting u.s .",
    "ports from jan .",
    "2004 to present , is used ( see section  [ para : bd_estimate ] for details ) .",
    "ecoregions are defined by species composition and shared evolutionary history  @xcite , and thereby capable of providing a more realistic outline of native and invasive ranges .",
    "therefore , we define non - indigenous status based on _ ecoregion concept _ in comparison to , for example , geographic distance as used in  @xcite . here , ecoregion delineations given by marine ecoregions of the world  @xcite and the freshwater ecoregions of the world  @xcite are used .",
    "then , annual averages of port temperature and salinity are given in the global ports database ( gpd )  @xcite are used for assessment of nis establishment risk that is based on environmental similarity ; the missing values in gpd are supplemented by estimates from the world ocean atlas 2009  @xcite when necessary .",
    "at the heart of a network analysis lies a graph abstraction of the ( often complex ) system that is under investigation .",
    "this graph must be capable of adequately capturing the system behavior via sets of _ nodes _ and _ edges _ that model flow / connectivity characteristics .",
    "previous work [ @cite ] on analysis of gsn impact on nis invasions , have employed _ undirected weighted graphs , _ where nodes are given by the ports ( visited by gsn ) and edge ( and their strength or weight ) are derived from traffic intensity between ports . while such modeling is perhaps adequate for network analysis , the task at hand , viz .",
    ", an analysis based on flow dynamics , a _ directed _ network that can adequately represent the directional and asymmetric flow between nodes is mandatory .",
    "therefore , a directed weighted graph that we refer to as the _ species flow network ( sfn ) _ is derived to better represent species flow characteristics among ports . here , species flow is derived based _ only _ on ballast water exchange , and contribution from hull - fouling is not considered .",
    "therefore , the resulting flow dynamics represent the species flow with respect to ballast exchange only . investigation of bio - fouling is relegated to a future publication ( see section  [ sec : conc ] ) .     paths with the highest species flow are shown . ]",
    "consider a _ directed graph _",
    "@xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the set of nodes and edges of @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "let the nodes in @xmath7 correspond to ports visited by the gsn and the _ weight _ of the directed edge @xmath8 given by @xmath9 $ ] represents the _ total probability of species introduction _ corresponding to all vessels traveling from port @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( without intermediate stopovers ) , for all @xmath12 .",

    "in addition , let @xmath18 , @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 denote the amount of ballast water discharged by vessel @xmath13 at @xmath11 , the efficacy of ballast water management for @xmath13 for the route @xmath21 , and the characteristic constant of discharge , respectively",
    ". then , the probability of vessel @xmath13 introducing species from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( without intermediate stopovers ) is given by : @xmath22 then , the total probability of species introduction for all vessels traveling from @xmath10 to @xmath11 is given by : @xmath23 where the product is taken over all routes @xmath17 in database @xmath24 s.t . a vessel @xmath13 travels from port @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",

    "therefore , in order to mitigate the above difficulties , ballast discharge is estimated based on linear regression models on dwt per vessel_type as in  @xcite . specifically , linear regression models on dwt for vessels of type bulk dry , general cargo , ro - ro cargo , chemical , liquified gas tankers , oil tankers , passenger vessels , refrigerated cargo , container ships and unknown / other ) are derived using only the non - zero discharge events recorded in nbic database .    furthermore , the relationship of ballast discharge amount to the likelihood of species introduction is not well defined .",

    "therefore , we investigate the relationship of vessel types to inter- and intra - cluster species flow in order to understand any existing patterns that maybe helpful in devising species management strategies ( based on latest 2005 - 2006 lmiu dataset ) .    [",

    "oil carriers tend to travel inter - cluster for over 25% of the time .",
    "furthermore , among the vessel types that do not travel frequently , some vessel types tend to travel inter - cluster in majority of their trips ( e.g. , wood - ship carriers : 40.4% , livestock carriers : 34.3% , semi - sub hl vessels : 37.4% and barge container carriers : 55.7% ) .    [",
    "[ frequent - intra - cluster - travelers ] ] frequent intra - cluster travelers + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    among the most frequent vessel types , passenger carriers tend to stay within clusters for 97.6% of their trips , thus imposing only a very minimal risk in terms of inter - cluster species translocation .",
    "similarly , barge ships also stay within the cluster for 98.1% of total trips .",
    "cluster analysis on sfn simplifies the gsn to port clusters and inter - cluster connections . by enforcing strict ballast management on major inter - cluster connections , species exchange from one cluster to another",
    "can be very efficiently reduced .",
    "however , management of species exchange within a cluster is more difficult due to relatively high traffic between ports ( and hence expensive ) .",
    "however , as it turns out , majority of the ports that belong to a given cluster belong to same or adjacent ecoregions .",
    "therefore , irrespective of the magnitude , such species exchanges do not cause nis invasions ( see section  [ sssec : nis_invasion_risk ] ) .",
    "furthermore , species exchanges that occur among ports with sufficiently high difference in environmental conditions also do not cause nis invasions .",
    "the presented clustering analysis on nis - irn exploits these facts to identify sub - clusters of ports within a ( sfn ) cluster , in order to identify mandatory pathways that needed to be managed for efficient nis flow control .    to illustrate ,",
    "let us consider eastern_north_america cluster , where majority of the ports are located in north america .",
    "five ( 5 ) sub - clusters are identified on nis - irn of eastern_north_america cluster ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : env_subcluster1 ] .",
    "average temperature and salinity of ports in eastern_north_america cluster are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : env_subcluster2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : env_subcluster3 ] , respectively .",
    "this approach effectively identifies groups of ports such that the ports within a sub - cluster have similar environmental conditions , but are very different to the ports that do not belong to it ; this can be clearly seen by comparing sub - clusters to temperature and salinity maps . in particular ,",
    "ports are clustered into 5 groups : ( i ) ports that are marked in `` blue '' are approximately @xmath30 , @xmath31 which are typical of marine ports near the equator ; ( ii ) ports that are marked in `` pink '' are approximately @xmath32 , @xmath33 which have significantly lower salinity , that they are either fresh water ports or estuaries .",
    "( iii ) ports that are marked in `` yellow '' are approximately @xmath34 , @xmath35 ; most of which are to the northeast of virginia , with a significantly lower average temperature ; ( iv ) ports that are marked in `` green '' are approximately @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where they have warm weather and moderate salinity ; and ( v ) ports that are marked in `` brown '' have around @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where most of them lie around virginia , where they have cold water temperature and moderate salinity .    with significantly different environmental conditions in different sub - clusters ( e.g. , those ones in fresh water and sea water ) , it is less likely that nis invasions will occur across these sub - clusters . on the other hand , for ports in the same sub - cluster ,",
    "it is very likely that invasions will happen among those ports , since they have very similar environmental conditions , and they are tightly coupled by ballast water exchange . in this way , clustering in nis - irn can serve as a powerful tool to help us better predict intra - cluster invasions .",
    "the clustering approach we present here allows us to see large - scale patterns of nis spread through the global shipping network .",
    "we find that , with a few exceptions , major clusters and inter - cluster connectors are consistent over many years , suggesting this information could be useful for informing policies . since our findings are qualitative , we can not provide specific risk probabilities to any particular port or shipping route nor can we statistically evaluate our results .",
    "however , given the poor quality of invasion data , particularly date of invasion and source region , rigorous statistical tests of any invasion predictions would be difficult .",
    "for example , many invasive species are not detected for years or decades after they are introduced , due to either the difficult taxonomic nature , population growth time lags ( sakai et al .",
    "2001 ) or biased taxonomic or geographic sampling effort ( ruiz et al . 2000 ) .",
    "further , many invasions often can not be attributed to a single vector or source of origin ( ruiz et al .",
    "2000 , hewitt et al .",
    "2004 , zenetos et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "we do , however , find that our results correspond well with reliable invasion data available from well - sampled ports and regions .",
    "for example , the recent influx of north pacific species into southeast australia s port phillip bay ( including a goby , green algae , and several crustaceans ; hewitt et al .",
    "2004 , lockett and gormon 2001 ) aligns with our finding that this port was in large pacific cluster from at least 1997 - 2006 .",
    "further , several species of northwest african origin have been recently detected in the mediterranean and northeast atlantic ( zenetos et al .",
    "2013 , clemente et al .",
    "2013 ) , corresponding with increasing number of north african ports joing these clusters over time .",
    "finally , the cluster analysis predicts that secondary spread of nis will be high among ports within a cluster , a phenomenon that has been observed several times in both the well - studied mediterranean and west atlantic clusters ( leppakoski and olenin 2000 , zenetos et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "overall , our patterns corresponds with observed data well , suggesting our results could be useful for predicting nis spread in poorly - studied regions or in the near - future . in particular , we observed an increasing number of ports in the northwest indian ocean have joined the pacific cluster , highlighting the high likelihood of recent invasions between these two regions .",
    "we also note a decline in highly - connected ports along the western united states ( ie .",
    "many california ports are not in a major cluster by 2005 ) .",
    "this pattern , in tandem with tightening ballast water restrictions by california , suggests that ship - born invasion rates should be decreasing in this region .",
    "finally , we note that chinese ports are diversifying into non - pacific clusters ( 3 non - pacific cluster ports in 1997 versus 9 in 2005 ) , suggesting that this country could be a new globally important source of invasive species .",
