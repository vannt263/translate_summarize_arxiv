    "recent observations@xcite suggest that the universe consists of dark energy ( @xmath3 ) , dark matter ( @xmath4 ) and baryon matter ( @xmath5 ) . to understand the nature of the dark energy is one of essential tasks in cosmology .",
    "the most simple form of the dark energy is the cosmological constant , which fits well to the observation data @xcite and which has the effective equation of state @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath7 .",
    "if the dark energy is totally contributed by the cosmological constant , the universe is asymptotically de sitter one and we should study the de sitter spacetime and asymptotically de sitter spacetimes in all aspects , including in the framework of general relativity @xcite , in the framework of de sitter invariant special relativity @xcite , and locally de sitter invariant gauge theory of gravity @xcite , etc .",
    "however , there is an evidence @xcite to show that the dark energy might evolve from @xmath8 in the past to @xmath9 today and cross @xmath0 in the intermediate redshift . obviously , the simple dynamical dark energy models considered vastly in the literature as well as the cosmological constant can not explain it . for example ,",
    "@xmath10 in the quintessence models @xcite is always evolving in the range of @xmath11 . in the phantom models",
    "@xcite , regardless its wrong - sign kinetic energy term , @xmath10 always varies below @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 of the effective equation of state for the general k - essence models @xcite also fails to cross @xmath0 .",
    "recently , many dark energy models with the property of crossing @xmath0 have been proposed @xcite . in the dynamical - scalar - field models of dark energy @xcite , either the malformed phantom fields or higher derivative term",
    "are needed . in @xcite ,",
    "the structures in extra dimension are introduced to realize the parameter @xmath10 crossing @xmath12 . in @xcite ,",
    "the dark energy is supposed to be contributed from a vector field @xcite or a gas of fermion particles interacting with a condensate represented by a vector field @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the vector - field and fermion - field models of the dark energy do not need phantom fields , higher derivative terms and more complex structure in extra dimension and so on .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall propose a new single - dynamical - scalar - field model , as a toy , of dark energy , which may explain that the parameter @xmath10 crosses @xmath12 at @xmath1 and the the universe experience a phase transition form decelerating to accelerating at @xmath2 .",
    "the basic idea is that the dark energy is not direct effect of a fundamental field , while it is only effectively described by a dynamical scalar field .",
    "taking it into account , we may consider the following model of a single dynamical scalar field coupled to an _ a priori _ non - dynamical , background covariant vector field , [ action ] s_^eff = d^4x ( 12g^_,_-g^ _ , a_-v ( ) ) where the vector @xmath14 describes some unknown effects of the universe and is supposed to have constant zeroth - component in a comoving system .",
    "in such a model , no phantom is needed to realize @xmath9 and @xmath10 crossing @xmath12 .    in the following",
    ", we shall introduce the model first .",
    "and then we shall make some numerical analysis with an ordinary potential and a potential inspired from supergravity @xcite .",
    "finally , we shall give some concluding remarks .",
    "suppose that the universe is governed by the action s = s_eh+s_fluid+s_^eff , where @xmath15 is the einstein - hilbert action of gravitation , @xmath16 is the action of perfect fluid , describing the baryonic matter and cold dark matter , and @xmath17 is the effective action of dark energy , which has been given in eq.([action ] ) . since @xmath14 is introduced as a part of the effective model of dark energy , we suppose that it only couples to the scalar field but does not couple to the matter .",
    "as the standard treatment in cosmology , we suppose that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scale , and further suppose that the universe is flat for simplicity , so that the geometry of the universe is described by the robertson - walker metric [ rwmetric ] ds^2=dt^2-a^2(t)(dr^2 + r^2 d_2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath18 is the line - element on a unit sphere . under the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy , all quantities , including @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc . , depend on @xmath21 only .",
    "in particular , the stress - energy tensor for the scalar field , defined by [ stress ] t_= 2 , reads [ stress - cp ] t_= ^2(t ) ^0_^0 _ -2(t ) a_0 ^0_^0_- 1 2 g _ ( ^2(t ) -2(t)a_0 -2v[(t ) ] ) . comparing the stress - energy tensor ( [ stress - cp ] ) with the one for perfect fluid , one may define the effective energy density and pressure of scalar field by _",
    "^(t ) & = & t_00=1 2 ^2(t ) -(t ) a_0 + v[(t ) ] , + p_^(t ) & = & -g^11t_11= 1 2 ^2(t ) -(t ) a_0 -v[(t ) ] . as the effective description of dark energy",
    ", @xmath22 should always be positive .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 in the effective equation of state @xmath23 is then [ w ] w= .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath24 , w    -1 , & 2a_0 0 , + < -1 , & 2a_0 > > 0 ^2 - 2a_0 + 2v ( ) > 0 , + , & 2a_0 > > 0 ^2 - 2a_0 + 2v ( ) 0 ,    and for @xmath25 , w    -1 , & 0 2a_0 , + < -1 , & 0 > > 2a_0 ^2 - 2a_0 + 2v ( ) > 0 , + irrelevant , & 0 > > 2a_0 ^2 - 2a_0 + 2v ( ) 0 .    namely , the parameter @xmath10 may cross @xmath12 in the evolution of the universe .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we suppose that @xmath14 has a constant norm and constant zeroth - component in robertson - walker metric . under the assumption ,",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath26 takes the form [ eomphi ] + 3h+ = 3ha_0 , where @xmath27 is the hubble parameter . comparing with the standard form of the equation of motion for a scalar field",
    ", there exists an additional current due to the existence of @xmath28 .",
    "now , the friedmann equation reads [ friedmann1 ] h^2 = 3(1 2 ^2 -a_0 + v ( ) + _ fluid^ ) , where the last term on the right - hand - side is the energy density of matter as a perfect fluid . in the present paper",
    ", we are only interested in the late stage of the evolution of the universe , in which both the baryon matter and cold dark matter can be treated as pressureless perfect fluid .",
    "thus , we may set = _ 0^a_0 ^ 3/a^3 , where @xmath29 is a constant , denoting the present value of the energy density of all matter .",
    "the subscript 0 , except in @xmath28 and the following @xmath30 , represents to take the value today .",
    "in order to solve eqs.([eomphi],[friedmann1 ] ) numerically , we recast them as the first - order differential equations with respect to the redshift @xmath31 , & = & - + & = & 3 + + h^2&=&1 2 ^2 -b_0+v ( ) + _ m0^(1+z)^3 , where = , = , b_0 = , h = h h_0 , v()= , _ m0^=. in terms of new variable , eq.([w ] ) becomes w= .",
    "the initial values of integration are assigned to fit the present observation data @xcite : h_0=1,&_de0^:=.(1 2 ^2 -b_0+v ) |_0 = 0.73,&_m0^ = 0.27 , + w_0=-1.33 , & _",
    "0^(_0^ -2b_0 ) = -0.24 , & v_0^ = 0.85 .",
    "now , we consider several examples .",
    "the first example is the universe with a quadratic potential [ potential ] v ( ) = 1 2 m^2 ^2 .",
    "we may further take @xmath32 and w_1=.|_0 = 1 , then @xmath33 , @xmath34 , v()|_z=0^==-0.117 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "1 gives the evolution of @xmath10 for a flat universe with a quadratic potential .",
    "it is obvious that the equation of state across @xmath0 at @xmath1 , which is consistent with the sne ia observation @xcite and that the transition redshift between the accelerating and decelerating phases occurs at @xmath37 , which is lower than the observational constraint on the transition redshift interval @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the limit of @xmath10 at large @xmath39 is 1 .     for a flat universe with a quadratic potential with the initial values @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath43 . the right figure is the expanded view of the left figure between @xmath44 and @xmath45.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for a flat universe with a quadratic potential with the initial values @xmath40 , @xmath41",

    "the next example is the universe with the potential inspired from supergravity @xcite , [ supgravpot ] v ( ) = v_0 ^-e^4 g ^2 , where @xmath47 is a constant . for the potential",
    ", we may take @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , thus @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "3 gives the evolution of @xmath10 for the model .",
    "the equation of state across @xmath0 at @xmath1 and the transition redshift between the accelerating and decelerating phases occurs at @xmath54 , which is consistent with the sne ia observation @xcite .",
    "however , the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath39 is not monotonic .",
    "@xmath10 becomes less than @xmath12 between @xmath55 and @xmath56 again .",
    "the universe experienced another accelerated expansion around @xmath57 .",
    "for a flat universe with a quadratic potential with the initial values @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath50 , @xmath49 , @xmath48 and @xmath43 . the right figure is the expanded view of the left figure between @xmath58 and @xmath45.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for a flat universe with a quadratic potential with the initial values @xmath40 , @xmath50 , @xmath49 , @xmath48 and @xmath43 . the right figure is the expanded view of the left figure between @xmath58 and @xmath45.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the single - dynamical - scalar - field model of dark energy may explain the parameter @xmath10 in the effective equation of state crossing @xmath12 during the evolution of the universe , as long as a fixed background vector field is introduced .",
    "for some potentials , the parameter @xmath10 crossing @xmath12 and transition from decelerating to accelerating occur at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , which is consistent with the observations .",
    "the dependence of the parameter @xmath10 on the redshift @xmath39 is far from the linear relation .",
    "thus , it is needed to re - analyze the observation data based on more general form of @xmath59 . by the way , without the introduction of oscillation potential , the universe may also exhibit some oscillation behaviors .",
    "the present model is in the almost standard framework of physics , _",
    "e.g. _ in general relativity in 4-dimension .",
    "there does not exist phantom in the model , which will lead to theoretical problems in field theory . instead ,",
    "an _ a priori _ vector field , @xmath14 , is introduced , which is selected in an unspecified way by the cosmological background .",
    "it will result in the violation of the lorentz invariance and might be contributed by the collective effects of the vacuum polarization of some fundamental fields .",
    "it is needed to further explore the physical meaning of such a vector field .",
