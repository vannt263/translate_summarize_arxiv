    "we study four systems and their interactions : a unified system of coupled forward - backward stochastic partial differential equations ( fb - spdes ) with lvy jumps ; a unified system of fb - sdes , a special form of the fb - spdes , however , with skew reflections ; a stochastic differential game ( sdg ) problem with general number of players based on the fb - sdes ; and a system of queues and their associated reflecting diffusion approximations .",
    "more precisely , there are four interconnected and streamlined aims involved in our discussions .",
    "the first aim is to study the adapted 4-tuple strong solution @xmath1 to the unified system of coupled fb - spdes with lvy jumps with respect to time - position parameter @xmath2 , @xmath3 where , @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] is a stopping time with regard to a filtration defined later in the paper , @xmath6 or @xmath7 for a positive integer @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denotes the corresponding left limit at time point @xmath10 . in particular",
    ", @xmath11 with a given @xmath12 is a connected domain , for examples , a @xmath13-dimensional box , a @xmath13-dimensional ball ( or a general manifold ) , a @xmath13-dimensional sphere ( or a general riemannian manifold ) , or the whole euclidean space @xmath14 of real numbers itself .",
    "the f - spde in is with the given initial random vector - field @xmath15 , while the b - spde in has the known terminal random vector - field @xmath16 . in",
    ", @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath19-dimensional and @xmath20-dimensional random vector - field processes respectively , @xmath21 is a standard @xmath22-dimensional brownian motion , and @xmath23 is a @xmath8-dimensional centered lvy jump process ( or centered subordinator ) .",
    "furthermore , the partial differential operators of @xmath19-dimensional vector @xmath24 , @xmath25-dimensional matrix @xmath26 , and @xmath27-dimensional matrix @xmath28 are functionals of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and their partial derivatives of up to the @xmath31th order for @xmath32 .",
    "so do the partial differential operators of @xmath20-dimensional vector @xmath33 , @xmath34-dimensional matrix @xmath35 , and @xmath36-dimensional matrix @xmath37 . more precisely",
    ", for each @xmath38 , @xmath39 where the dot  @xmath40 \" in @xmath41 and its associated partial derivatives denotes the integration in terms of the so - called lvy measure .",
    "however , if @xmath42 , the last line on the right - hand side of should be changed to the form , @xmath43    = 3.5 in    note that our partial differential operators presented in can be general - nonlinear and high - order , e.g. , @xmath44 for a general nonlinear functional @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are nonnegative integers satisfying @xmath47 with @xmath32 . furthermore , the initial random vector - field @xmath15 , the terminal random vector - filed @xmath16 , and the 4-tuple solution process @xmath1 can be complex - valued .    under an infinite sequence of generalized local linear growth and lipschitz conditions ,",
    "we prove the existence and uniqueness of an adapted 4-tuple strong solution to the fb - spdes in a suitably constructed functional topological space .",
    "the solution to the unified system in can be interpreted in a sample surface manner with time - position parameter @xmath48 ( see , e.g. , @xmath49 in figure  [ samplesurface ] for such an example ) . the quite involved technical proof developed in this paper",
    "is extended from our earlier work summarized in dai  @xcite ( arxiv , 2011 ) for a unified b - spde .",
    "more precisely , the newly unified system of coupled fb - spdes in covers many existing forward and/or backward sdes / spdes as special cases , where the partial differential operators are taken to be special forms . for examples , specific single - dimensional strongly nonlinear f - spde and b - spde driven solely by brownian",
    "motions can be respectively derived for the purpose of optimal - utility based portfolio choice ( see , e.g , musiela and zariphopoulou  @xcite ) . here",
    ", the strong nonlinearity is in the sense addressed by lions and souganidis  @xcite and pardoux  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the single - dimensional stochastic hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equations are also examples of our unified system in , which are specific b - spdes ( see , e.g. , @xmath50ksendal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "note that the proof of the well - posedness concerning solution to the b - spde derived in musiela and zariphopoulou  @xcite and solution to the hjb equation derived in @xmath50ksendal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is covered by the study in dai  @xcite ( arxiv , 2011 ) although the authors in both @xcite and @xmath50ksendal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite claim it as an open problem .",
    "the proof of the well - posedness about solution to the f - spde derived in musiela and zariphopoulou  @xcite is covered by the even more unified discussion for the coupled fb - spdes in of this paper .",
    "actually , partial motivations to enhance the unified b - spde in dai  @xcite ( arxiv , 2011 ) to the coupled fb - spdes in are from the conference discussion  @xcite during 45 minutes invited talk presented by zariphopoulou in icm 2014 , where the current author claimed that the well - posedness of solution to the f - spde in @xcite can be proved by the method developed in dai  @xcite ( arxiv , 2011 ) .",
    "besides these existing examples , our motivations to study the coupled fb - spdes in are also from optimal portfolio management in finance ( see , e.g. , dai  @xcite ) , and multi - channel ( or multi - valued ) image regularization such as color images in computer vision and network applications ( see , e.g. , caselles _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in this part",
    ", we also show the usages of our unified system in in heat diffusions and quantum hall / anomalous hall effects as two illustrative examples to support our first aim .",
    "mathematically , we refine a stochastic dirichlet - poisson problem from heat diffusions and use stochastic schr@xmath51dinger equation as model for hall effects in quantum statistics .",
    "it is worth to point out that the proving methodology developed in the current paper and its early version in dai  @xcite ( arxiv , 2011 ) is aimed to provide a general theory and framework to show the well - posedness of a unified general system class of the coupled fb - spdes in .",
    "however , some specific forms of the fb - spdes in ( either in forward manner or in backward manner ) may be solved by alternative techniques , e.g. , the author in his fields metal awarded work ( hairer  @xcite and icm 2014 ) solves the kpz equation by rough path technology , and furthermore , the related rough path theory can deal with the lack of either temporal or spatial regularity ( see , e.g. , hairer  @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the second aim of the paper is to prove the well - posedness of an adapted 6-tuple weak solution @xmath52 with 2-tuple boundary regulator @xmath53 to the ( possible ) non - markovian system of coupled fb - sdes with lvy jumps and skew reflections under a given control rule @xmath54 , @xmath55 in , @xmath56 is a @xmath13-dimensional process governed by the f - sde with skew reflection matrix @xmath57 and @xmath18 is a @xmath20-dimensional process governed by the b - sde with skew reflection matrix @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath59 can increase only when @xmath56 is on a boundary @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 can increase only when @xmath18 is on a boundary @xmath63 with @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are two nonnegative integers .",
    "both @xmath59 and @xmath62 are the regulating processes with possible jumps to push @xmath56 and @xmath18 back into the state spaces @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "they are parts of the 6-tuple solution to and determined by solution pairs to the well - known skorohod problem ( see , e.g. , dai  @xcite , dai and dai  @xcite , or section  [ gfbproof ] of the current paper for such a definition ) .",
    "thus , we call them as skorohod regulators ( see , figure  [ reflection ] for such an example ) . note that , comparing with the unified system in , the coefficients appeared in do not contain any partial derivative operator but",
    "the fb - sdes themselves involve skew boundary reflections .",
    "the proof for the well - posedness of an adapted 6-tuple weak solution to the fb - sdes is based on two general conditions .",
    "the first one is a general completely-@xmath0 condition ( see , e.g. , dai  @xcite , dai and dai  @xcite , and figure  [ reflection ] for an illustration ) .",
    "the non - uniqueness of solution to an associated skorohod problem under this condition is one of the major difficulties in the proof .",
    "= 3.5 in    the second one is the generalized linear growth and lipschitz conditions , where the conventional growth and lipschitz constant is replaced by a possible unbounded but mean - squarely integrable adapted stochastic process ( see , e.g. , dai  @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "if the completely-@xmath0 condition becomes more strict , e.g. , with additional requirements that the spectral radii in certain sense for both reflection matrices are strictly less than the unity , a unique adapted 6-tuple strong solution will be concerned .",
    "concerning coupled fb - sdes , it motivates a hot research area ( see , e.g. , @xmath50ksendal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite about the discussion of coupled fb - sdes with no boundary reflection , karatzas and li  @xcite about the study of brownian motion driven b - sde with reflection , and references therein ) .",
    "however , to our best knowledge , the coupled system in with double skew reflection matrices and the well - posedness study in terms of an adapted 6-tuple weak solution with lvy jumps and under a general completely-@xmath0 condition through the skorohod problem are new and for the first time in this area .",
    "the third aim of the paper involves two folds .",
    "on the one hand , we use the 4-tuple solution to the coupled fb - spdes in to obtain an adapted 6-tuple solution to the system in ; on the other hand , we use the obtained adapted 6-tuple solution to determine a pareto optimal nash equilibrium policy process to a non - zero - sum sdg problem in , which is newly formulated by the fb - sdes in . in this game , there are @xmath20-players and each player @xmath69 has his own value function @xmath70 subject to the system in under an admissible control policy @xmath54 .",
    "every player @xmath71 chooses an optimal policy to maximize his own value function over an admissible policy set @xmath72 while the summation of all value functions is also maximized , i.e. , @xmath73 for each @xmath74 , where , @xmath75 note that the total value function @xmath76 does not have to be a constant ( e.g. , zero ) , or in other words , the game is not necessarily a zero - sum one .    the contribution and literature review of the study associated with the game in - for the third aim can be summarized as follows .",
    "one of the important solution methods for sde based optimal control is the dynamic programming . in general , this method is related to a special case of the unified system in ( or its earlier unified b - spde form in dai  @xcite ( arxiv , 2011 ) ) , e.g. , the specific b - spde with @xmath77 ( called stochastic hjb equation ) in peng  @xcite with no jumps and @xmath50ksendal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite with jumps . here ,",
    "we extend the discussions in peng  @xcite and @xmath50ksendal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to a system of generalized coupled forward - backward oriented stochastic hjb equations with jumps corresponding to the case that @xmath78 .",
    "more importantly , this system provides an effective way to resolve a non - zero - sum sdg problem with jumps and general number of @xmath20 players , which subjects to a non - markovian system of coupled fb - sdes with lvy jumps and skew reflections ( see , e.g. , figure  [ gamei ] for such a game platform ( partially adapted from dai  @xcite ) ) .",
    "= 3.5 in    by a solution to the fb - spdes in , we determine a solution to the fb - sdes in under a given control rule and then obtain a pareto optimal nash equilibrium policy process to the non - zero - sum sdg problem in .",
    "note that , the concept and technique concerning the non - zero - sum sdg and pareto optimality used in this paper is refined and generalized from dai  @xcite and karatzas and li  @xcite .",
    "the fourth aim of the paper involves three folds .",
    "first , we study some queueing networks ( see , e.g. , figure  [ queuei ] )    = 3.5 in    whose dynamics ( e.g. , queue length process ) is governed by specific forms of the fb - sdes in .",
    "these forms can be a lvy driven sde , a @xmath13-dimensional reflecting brownian motion ( rbm ) ( see , e.g. , dai  @xcite , dai and dai  @xcite , dai and jiang  @xcite ) , or a reflecting diffusion with regime switching ( rdrs ) ( see , e.g. , dai  @xcite ) .",
    "the reflecting diffusion is the functional limit of a sequence of physical queueing processes under diffusive scaling , a general completely-@xmath0 boundary reflection constraint , and a well - known heavy traffic condition ( an analogous treatment as the one for  infinite constant \" in the kpz equation ( see , e.g. , hairer  @xcite ) ) . in reality , the characteristics of lvy driven networks may be used to model or approximate more general batch - arrival and batch - service queueing networks .",
    "second , we discuss how to use the queueing systems and their associated reflecting diffusion approximations to motivate the sdg problem . the criterion for the players in the game can be the queue length based performance optimization ones or queueing related cost / profit optimization ones .",
    "third , we study the applications of the fb - spdes presented by in the queueing networks .",
    "there are two types of equations involved .",
    "one is the kolmogorov s equation or fokker - planck s formula oriented pdes / spdes , which are corresponding to the distributions of queueing length processes under given network control rules .",
    "this type of equations are mainly used to estimate the performance measures of the queueing networks .",
    "another type of equations are the hjb equation oriented pdes / spdes , which are mainly used to obtain optimal control rules over the set of admissible strategies for the queueing networks .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ uniexist ] , we introduce suitable functional topological space and state conditions required for our main theorems to guarantee the well - posedness of an adapted 4-tuple strong solution to the unified system of coupled fb - spdes in . in section  [ fbsdes ] , we study the unified system of coupled fb - sdes with lvy jumps and skew reflections in and present the well - posedness theorem . in particular , we establish the solution connection between the fb - spdes and the fb - sdes . in section  [ queuesdg ] , we formally formulate the fb - sdes based sge problem in and determine the pareto optimal nash equilibrium policy process by a system of generalized stochastic hjb equations ( a particular form of the coupled fb - spdes ) .",
    "related applications in queueing networks are also discussed .",
    "finally , in sections  [ uniextproof]-[gtheoremproof ] , we develop theory to prove our main theorems .",
    "first of all , let @xmath79 be a fixed complete probability space .",
    "then , we define a standard @xmath22-dimensional brownian motion @xmath80\\}$ ] for a given @xmath81 with @xmath82 and a @xmath8-dimensional general lvy pure jump process ( or special subordinator ) @xmath83\\}$ ] with @xmath84 on the space ( see , e.g. , applebaum  @xcite , bertoin  @xcite , and sato  @xcite ) . note that the prime appeared in this paper is used to denote the corresponding transpose of a matrix or a vector .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 , @xmath85 , and their components are supposed to be independent of each other . for each @xmath86 ,",
    "which is called a reversion rate vector in many applications , we let @xmath87 .",
    "then , we denote a filtration by @xmath88 with @xmath89 for each @xmath90 $ ] , where @xmath91 is @xmath92-algebra independent of @xmath21 and @xmath85 .",
