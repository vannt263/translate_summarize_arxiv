    "the lynds dark nebula ldn 1778/1780 ( lynds 1962 ) is a moderately dense ( translucent ) region with galactic coordinates l = 359@xmath1 and b=36@xmath1.8 .",
    "this compact nebula , hereinafter only referred as ldn 1780 , is located at h @xmath23 h@xmath24 ( = 15 pc ) + 66 pc ( assuming a distance of @xmath25 pc , franco 1989 ) from the galactic midplane .",

    "it shows a well defined boundary towards nw and is more diffuse on the se side , which faces the galactic plane .",
    "ldn 1780 was studied together with other nearby clouds ( ldn 134 , ldn 183 , ldn 169 , mbm 38 and mbm 39 ) by laureijs et al .",

    "the 100 @xmath0 m emission excess @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the emissions at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m and @xmath32 is the average ratio @xmath33 , which is 0.27 for ldn 1780 and 0.21 for the rest of the clouds ) corresponds to the emission from the `` classical '' big grains ( without the contribution from the very small grains ) .",
    "lfhmic95 found that there is a good correlation of @xmath34 and the @xmath4co(j=1 - 0 ) line integrated ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "although the ratio @xmath36 in ldn 1780 is significantly higher than in the other clouds , it presents a similar ratio @xmath37 .",
    "lfhmic95 concluded that the anisotropic uv radiation field in the complex affects the density distribution , especially on the illuminated side of the clouds with a bigger halo , but also in the densest , well - shielded regions , shifted with respect to the cloud centres to the opposite side of the illuminated halos .",

    "x - ray observations at @xmath39 , @xmath40 and 1.5 kev support that ldn 1780 is located at the boundary of the local bubble and show that the cloud is not affected by any possible hot gas flowing from the hotter bubble loop i to the local bubble ( kuntz , snowden & verter , 1997 ) .",
    "ldn 1780 is the only translucent cloud in which has been observed extended red emission ( ere ) ( chlewicki & laureijs 1987 ) so far .",
    "the ere in this cloud has a broad , unstructured band , with a peak near 7000  .",
    "this peak s wavelength is longer than expected , and it could be due to silicon nanoparticles in a environment with relatively high electron density and lower uv photon density in comparison with the diffuse interstellar medium ( smith & witt 2002 ) .",

    "note that @xmath72 could be different for the warm and cold components ( see also discussion in paper ii ) .",
    "an unrealistic value of @xmath72=1 for the warm component implies that @xmath123 decreases @xmath650% . if @xmath1241.5 , then t@xmath627k and the ratio @xmath123 drops @xmath620% with respect to the value for @xmath72=2 .",
    "a further investigation is out of the scope of the data presented here .",
    "the h@xmath17 emission in ldn 1780 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : figure12 ] , _ left _ ) varies between @xmath126 and 4 rayleigh , and its error is @xmath60.4 rayleigh ( finkbeiner 2003 ) .",
    "the extinction @xmath13 correlates very well with the h@xmath17 emission , with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : figure12 ] , _ right _ ) .",
    "there is a linear relation between the h@xmath17 emission and @xmath13 that remains till @xmath472 mag , and then flattens .",
    "the correlation is observed in regions with an abundant molecular gas content , which is surprising since the uv radiation field from the galactic plane and the sco - cen ob association can not come in through so deep ( see sect .",
    "4.2.1 ) .",
    "such a good correlation between the h@xmath17 emission and the extinction in ldn 1780 strongly suggests that the ionised gas and the dust share a significant emitting volume and are quite uniformly mixed within it .",
    "the flattening in the h@xmath17 emission at high @xmath13 ( @xmath62 mag ) is likely result of dust extinction ( see fig . [",
    "fig : figure12 ] , _ right _ ) .",
    "it is therefore suitable to correct the observed h@xmath17 emission @xmath127 ) from extinction using the following equation :    @xmath128    the optical depth at the wavelength of h@xmath17 is obtained from our near - infrared extinction map and the cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction law which gives @xmath129 so that @xmath130 . in the surroundings of the cloud , with @xmath131 ,",
    "the equation ( 6 ) gives @xmath132 ; toward the peak of the cloud @xmath133 .",

    "1990 ) , we obtained a ratio @xmath19=2.2@xmath90.1 r mag@xmath15 .",
    "this is twice the value of @xmath134 .",
    "note there is an offset in the relation with @xmath18=1.4@xmath90.15 r at @xmath135 mag .",
    "the disk - like distribution of emitting gas in the galaxy produces an emission @xmath136 rayleigh ( reynolds 1984 ) , which corresponds to 1.7 r at the latitude of ldn 1780 .",
    "the observed relation between @xmath18 and @xmath13 indicates that the ionisation and recombination processes are even produce in very deep regions of the cloud , with optical extinctions of @xmath62 mag .",
    "this is likely due to a source of ionisation that can penetrate much deeper into the cloud than the uv and the x - ray radiations and produces a nearly uniform ionisation rate in the cloud .",
    "the observed ratio @xmath46 gives us the possibility to estimate the ionisation rate from the following equation :    @xmath137    which results to be @xmath610@xmath20 @xmath21 s@xmath15 .",
    "we have used @xmath138 = @xmath139 mag@xmath15 @xmath140 ( bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) .",
    "although this corresponds to a very high ionisation rate for the intermediate density cloud ldn 1780 , it worth noting it is only a lower limit obtained by assuming that every collision with an high energy particle yield a h@xmath17 photon emission .",
    "other clouds in the ldn 134 like ldn 169 , ldn 183 and ldn 134 also present h@xmath17 emission .",
    "the origin of the ionisation source is discussed in the next sections .",
    "ldn 1780 as well as ldn 134 , ldn 183 and ldn 169 are likely influenced by an anisotropic radiation field ( thlm95 , lfhmic95 ) .",
    "the southern sides of these clouds face the nearby uv sources @xmath22 oph ( an o9.5v star at a distance of 140 pc from the sun ) and the upper scorpius ob association .",
    "lfhmic95 studied the variation of the dust and molecular gas tracers along a line parallel to the direction of the uv radiation field ( assumed toward upper scorpius ob association ) crossing the centres of ldn 1780 and ldn 134 .",
    "they pointed out some differences between these clouds . for ldn 1780 : i ) no detection of dense and opaque clumps is observed , although thlm95 found a weak emission of c@xmath27o , ii ) the emission is significantly brighter at 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath0 m emission compared to ldn 134 ( also ldn 183 ) ; iii ) the 60 and 100 @xmath0 m profiles are asymmetric ( as in ldn 134 ) , but similar , and peak at the same position as the carbon monoxide lines , while in ldn 134 there is an offset for the w(@xmath4co ) ; iv ) @xmath141 and @xmath142 decreases toward the shadow side , while in ldn 134 they are either nearly constant or present a decrease toward higher densities ; v ) the co temperature peak is highly symmetric , contrary to ldn 134 ; vi ) the lines are narrower on the shadow side .",
    "thlm95 suggested that only the external region of ldn 1780 might be affected by the local radiation field .",
    "they estimated that the radiation field in the illuminated side of ldn 1780 could few ( 2 or 3 ) times higher than the average radiation field at its galactic latitude because of the presence of the ob association .",
    "thlm95 concluded the asymmetric uv illumination from the scorpius - centaurus association and from the galactic plane has influenced the morphology of ldn 1780 , resulting in the offset of the hi emission maximum , the blue - shifted ( out - flowing ) molecular gas envelope and the enhancement of the vsg abundance toward the side facing the galactic plane .",
    "thlm95 claim that the offset found between the radiation temperature peaks of co and @xmath4co and the comet - like morphology can not be explained by the uv asymmetry .",
    "they concluded from the study of the morphologies of co(j=1 - 0 ) and @xmath4co(j=1 - 0 ) that the offset between the maximum of the co temperature peak and the geometrical centre can be explained as result of a shock front that passed through the cloud .",
    "the core of @xmath4co and the evaporating lower density envelope of gas pointing to ne correspond to the `` head '' and the `` tail '' of the cometary nebula , respectively ( see next sect . ) .",
    "the maps of h@xmath17 emission and @xmath13 show a good correlation , and no asymmetry evidence is observed between the shadow and illuminated sides .",
    "the observe h@xmath17 enhancement is entirely related to ldn1780 .",
    "we also observe that h@xmath17 emission is present in the other clouds of the ldn 134 complex .",
    "however , ldn 1780 is the only cloud of the ldn 134 complex where ere emission has been reported ( chlewicki & laureijs 1987 ) .",
    "smith & witt ( 2002 ) have interpreted the ere in ldn 1780 as result of photoluminescence of silicon nanoparticles .",
    "they observed a relatively high quantum efficiency of the ere process ( @xmath613% ) as well as a long wavelength emission peak at 7000  .",
    "they argued that given the relatively high electron density and low uv photon density within the cloud in comparison with the dism , the overall ionisation equilibrium tends more towards neutrality , and then the silicon nanoparticles are predominantly neutral , with an increment in the abundance of the largest particles , and then the overall quantum efficiency increases and the emission peak shifts to longer wavelengths .",
    "we have checked the h@xmath17 emission maps and far - infrared emission of the 23 objects ( dism , ldn1780 , reflection nebulae , hii regions ) in the sample of smith & witt ( 2002 ) finding that there are only few of them with a clear counterpart in h@xmath17 .",
    "ldn 1780 is one of the few of them with a correlation between h@xmath17 and far - infrared emission .",
    "we have also noticed that other clouds of the ldn 134 complex as the dense ldn 183 present h@xmath17 in regions with a very low emission at 12 and 25 @xmath0 m .    we conclude that the asymmetry of the radiation field is mainly affecting the warm component , which mostly contain _ warm _ bgs .",
    "the warm component is likely associated to the hi excess emission and it is surrounding the cold component ( see figure [ fig : figure6 ] ) . the cold component , consisting of cold big dust grains ,",
    "is well shielded from the uv radiation .",
    "the observation of h@xmath17 emission at high column densities where co emission is also observed supports the existence of a ionisation flux that can penetrate very deep into the cloud reaching the inner regions of it with @xmath1432 mag .",
    "the uv radiation field from the galactic plane and the ob association significantly decreases for @xmath1430.3 - 0.5 mag and can not explain the observed co and h@xmath17 emissions .",
    "the x - rays dominates the cosmic ionisation for smaller column densities .",
    "therefore , both ionisation sources can not give account of the observed ionisation rate in ldn 1780 and can be rejected out .",
    "thlm95 pointed out the importance of a shock front of @xmath610 km s@xmath15 in the morphology of ldn 1780 .",
    "based on the idea of de geus et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , thlm95 suggested that an expanding hi shell originated from the scorpius - centaurus ob association could be eventually fragmented forming clumps that were reached by a shock front ( of 10 - 15 km s@xmath15 ) of supernovae originated in the upper centaurus - lupus subgroup of sco - cen association . as result , some cometary shaped clouds as ldn 1780 were formed .    assuming that ldn 1780 was formed as result of a shock front , is it possible that the emission in h@xmath17 has been _ induced by a shock",
    "? there is an evolution in the h@xmath17 surface brightness , @xmath144 , of a region that undergoes a shock and compress to form a molecular cloud . during the initial phase , when the gas temperature is still high ( @xmath6 1000k ) the typical surface brightness of h@xmath17 is @xmath145 ( 0.009 ) r for a shock speed of 10 ( 20 ) km s@xmath15 . in general ,",
    "once h@xmath41 is formed ( dominated by self - shielding or dust shielding depending on the shock speed , see bergin et al .",
    "2005 ) nearly all hydrogen is molecular ( only about 1% by fraction in atomic form )",
    ". only a small fraction of h@xmath146 is produced , which will give h@xmath17 when it recombines .",
    "this should drastically reduce the h@xmath17 emission once the gas is ( mostly ) molecular ( edwin bergin 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "higher values of the shock speed front yield higher values of @xmath144 at the first stages of the shock , but @xmath144 always drops by several orders once h@xmath41 is formed .",
    "the timescale of co molecular cloud formation is not established by the h@xmath41 formation rate on to grains , but by the timescale for accumulating a sufficient column density ( @xmath147 mag ; bergin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we interpret the observed ionisation rate for ldn 1780 , @xmath148 s@xmath15 , as due to an enhanced cosmic ray flux .",
    "the observed value of @xmath149 is around one order of magnitude higher than the standard value for the ism ( @xmath150 s ) .",
    "our determination of @xmath149 depends on the assumed standard ratio @xmath151 .",
    "this ratio could depend on the environment conditions ; a factor 2 for the uncertainty is probably conservative .",
    "enhanced values of @xmath149 have been suggested for the dism by mccall et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from h@xmath152 measurements , but it is by first time found in a translucent cloud .",
    "low - energy cosmic rays of @xmath6100 mev dominate the ionisation fraction and heating of cool neutral gas in the interstellar medium , especially in dark uv - shielded molecular regions ( goldsmith & langer 1978 ) .",
    "the observed h@xmath17 enhancement could be explained as result of a confinement by self generated mhd waves of low energy cosmic rays ( padoan & scalo 2005 ) .",
    "there are other alternatives that require further investigation as multiple magnetic mirrors that could lead to cosmic ray variations ( cesarsky & volk 1978 ) .",
    "the study of padoan & scalo ( 2005 ) indicates the possible enhancement of the cosmic ray flux for densities below @xmath65@xmath2610@xmath116 @xmath8 .",
    "although this value depends on different assumptions ( see padoan & scalo 2005 for discussion ) , it is in good agreement with the value found for the @xmath4co core of ldn 1780 , with a density of @xmath153 @xmath8 according to thlm95 , and @xmath154 @xmath8 for lfhmic95 .",
    "our relatively high temperature ( @xmath616k ) for the cold component , whose emission correlates very well with @xmath13 and @xmath4co , also supports the presence of a source of ionisation like the cosmic rays that go much deeper than uv photons and contribute to the heating of the cloud .",
    "the interaction of cosmic rays with molecular clouds can produce h@xmath17 by several ways .",
    "the more direct one would be @xmath155 where the h@xmath146 emits h@xmath17 by recombination with an electron .",
    "the result of the reaction also contains a neutral h which can be excited and lead to an h@xmath17 photon emission .",
    "the collision of an energetic particle with molecular hydrogen does not necessarily produce an hydrogen atom .",
    "the reaction could be @xmath156 which reacts quickly with another h@xmath41 ( lepp 1992 ) : @xmath157 followed by the classical dissociative recombination @xmath158 or @xmath159 .",
    "all the hydrogen atoms resulting from these reactions can potentially emit an h@xmath17 photon when they are produced in an excited state .",
    "a fully description of the processes involved in the cosmic ray interactions in the ism to give account of the h@xmath17 emission has to be carried out to confirm our interpretation .",
    "in particular , the efficiency of each reaction mentioned above and its probability to produce an h@xmath17 photon is unknown .",
    "the cosmic ray rate we have estimated from the h@xmath17 surface brightness is believed to be a conservative lower limit .",
    "the analysis of the data shows the following :    1 .",
    "the h@xmath17 emission is well correlated with the extinction map , with an evident increase up to optical extinctions of @xmath62 mag .",
    "there is a deep penetration of the ionisation flux that produces h@xmath17 in regions with a molecular content , but also a likely influence of the ionisation flux on the balance of the chemical abundances in the densest regions .",
    "cosmic rays of @xmath6 100 mev can reach the inner regions .",
    "the warm and cold components of large dust grains in ldn 1780 have been separated .",
    "the warm component is surrounding the cold component , and it is mainly in the illuminated side of the cloud as the hi excess emission .",
    "the cold component is associated to the @xmath4co core .",
    "3 .   the warm and cold components have an average colour temperature of 25k and 16k ( assuming @xmath72=2 ) , respectively .",
    "the optical depth of the warm component is few tens lower than the value of the cold component .",
    "the observed colour temperatures are relatively high for moderate density regions ( see paper i ) , which support the presence of a large penetration depth ionisation source ( i.e , cosmic rays ) .",
    "the cold component presents a ratio @xmath160 that varies between 1  10@xmath95 and 3  10@xmath95 mag@xmath15 , which are significantly above the values of the warm component and around the value of the diffuse interstellar medium ( 2.5  10@xmath95 mag@xmath15 ) .",
    "the warm component consists of _ warm _ bgs that are influenced by the asymmetric radiation field , with has a major component from the sco - cen ob association and the galactic plane",
    ". the uv radiation field , with a penetration depth much lower than the cosmic rays , might affect the outer regions of the warm component , which might be associated to the hi excess emission ( @xmath13 up to 1 mag ) .",
    "the inner regions of the warm component could be partly associated with co ; the blue - shifted ( out - flowing ) co component being likely affected by the uv radiation field , although @xmath161co correlates better with the cold component .",

    "<S> this correlation is observed for a relatively large range of column densities and indicates the presence of a source of ionisation that can penetrate deep into the cloud ( reaching zones with optical extinctions @xmath13 of 2 mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on modelling predictions we reject out a shock front as precursor of the observed h@xmath17 surface brightness although that process could be responsible of the formation of ldn 1780 . using the ratio @xmath19 we have estimated a ionisation rate for ldn 1780 that results to be @xmath610@xmath20 @xmath21 s@xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> the enhancement in the ionisation rate could be explained as result of a confinement of low energy ( @xmath6100 mev ) cosmic rays by self generated mhd waves ( padoan & scalo 2005 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the cosmic rays could be from supernovae in the scorpio - centaurus ob association and/or the runaway @xmath22 ophiuchus . the observed low @xmath4co abundance and relatively high temperatures of the dust in ldn 1780 support the existence of a heating source that can come in through the denser regions of the cloud .    </S>",
