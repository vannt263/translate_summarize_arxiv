    "the probabilities for various numbers of hadrons to be produced in a high energy collision , in a fixed region of phase space that is usually defined by a range of pseudo - rapidity , is known as the _ multiplicity distribution_. attempts have been made to understand multiplicity distributions on the basis of intuitive notions of branching and decay of `` clusters '' @xcite . approaches with an explicit basis in qcd have also been made for regimes where an underlying hard scattering permits perturbative techniques @xcite .",
    "qcd simulation programs such as herwig @xcite include elements of both of these approaches .    previous work on the multiplicity distribution @xmath1 has centered on kno scaling and its violation @xcite , `` intermittency '' @xcite , and the factorial moments @xmath2 , @xmath3,  @xcite .",
    "these related concepts emphasize average and larger - than - average multiplicities , which reflect the multiple soft jet production that is characteristic of qcd at high energy . in this paper , we instead focus on the region of low multiplicity .    at the extreme low end of the multiplicity distribution ,",
    "one encounters the physics of _ rapidity gaps _ , which can be defined as regions of length @xmath4 in rapidity that contain no final - state particles .",
    "rapidity gaps offer a unique insight into the workings of qcd .",
    "they can in principle be made by the exchange of a color - singlet object , such as an appropriate state of two or more gluons . they can also be considered  by definition  to be a facet of the mysterious _ pomeron _ that also governs elastic and diffractive scattering .",
    "a particularly interesting type of rapidity gap occurs when the gap lies between two high-@xmath5 jets that are widely separated in rapidity and approximately back - to - back in azimuthal angle @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the multiplicity distribution in a region between two such jets , resulting from non - pomeron physics ; since that is an unavoidable background to probing rapidity gap physics .",
    "the major detectors cdf and d at the tevatron ( @xmath6 at @xmath7 ) , and zeus and h1 at hera @xcite ( @xmath8 at @xmath9 ) , can be used to study rapidity gaps experimentally . however , the range in pseudo - rapidity where these detectors are most sensitive , reduced to leave room for jet evidence of hard scattering , is not very large .",
    "could in principle be extended using scintillation counters as `` gap detectors '' .",
    "a detector upgrade of this type should be relatively simple , since it is not necessary to have fine segmentation to look for zero particles ! ]",
    "it is therefore important to estimate the background from fluctuations in `` normal '' multiparticle production .",
    "this is the motivation for our study of the multiplicity distribution at small @xmath10 .",
    "quantitative results presented in this paper are based on the qcd monte carlo program herwig @xcite .",
    "this program incorporates the color connections between partons , and therefore includes the natural suppression of rapidity gaps that is present in qcd , apart from the possibility of coherent color - singlet exchange .",
    "it therefore provides a proper model for the _ background _ to rapidity gap physics .",
    "the simulation also models the production and decay of many of the known low - mass hadronic resonances .",
    "these create short - range rapidity correlations that strongly influence the multiplicity distribution in small intervals .",
    "the monte carlo also provides an opportunity to appraise the standard practice of substituting the easily - measured pseudo - rapidity variable @xmath11 $ ] for the more natural true rapidity @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "there is no guarantee , of course , that monte carlo predictions for the multiplicity are correct . but",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that formulae that will be adequate to parametrize the eventual experiments should be at least flexible enough to fit the simulated data .",
    "when real data become available , one may hope to tune the monte carlo parameters to improve the accuracy of the simulation .",
    "parametrizations based on the simulation may also be useful in correcting actual data for losses due to incomplete acceptance .",
    "this is especially important for the major detectors cdf and d , which were not designed to measure particles with transverse momenta below @xmath13 . on the other hand",
    ", we will use the simulation to show in sect .",
    "[ sec : edgeeffects ] that it may actually be _",
    "desirable _ to neglect particles with very low @xmath5 , since that region is overly sensitive to contamination by particles produced in the decays of resonances that are far away in rapidity , and since particles other than photons at small @xmath14 are kinematically suppressed there anyway .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "[ sec : tools ] introduces some useful mathematical tools for working with multiplicity distributions ",
    "many of which have been suggested previously @xcite .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] summarizes principal conclusions .",
    "our subject is @xmath1 , the set of probabilities to observe @xmath10 particles in an event in a selected region of phase space .",
    "the region is generally defined in terms of pseudo - rapidity @xmath15 , or in terms of the lego variables @xmath15 and azimuthal angle @xmath16 .",
    "the particles are mainly @xmath17 , and @xmath18 from @xmath19 decay , with average transverse momenta of a few hundred @xmath20 .    the distribution is conveniently represented by the generating function @xmath21 which carries all of the information of @xmath22 .",
    "the factorial moments are related to the behavior of @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 : @xmath25 meanwhile , the low multiplicity region we are interested in is contained in the behavior as @xmath26 : @xmath27    in principle , @xmath28 is exactly zero beyond some large maximum @xmath10 , because the energy in the event is finite ; so @xmath23 is a high - order polynomial . in practice",
    ", however , @xmath28 falls smoothly and rapidly ( perhaps exponentially ) at large @xmath10 , and becomes immeasurably small long before the maximum value is approached .",
    "hence it is appropriate to approximate @xmath23 by an analytic function , whose infinite series converges at least out to @xmath29 in the complex plane in view of the fact that @xmath30 .",
    "the analytic behavior of @xmath23 can be useful . for if one has an analytic expression for @xmath31 , from a model or simply a parametrization , a convenient method to calculate the corresponding probabilities is to integrate @xmath32 numerically around the unit circle in the complex plane and use cauchy s theorem to obtain @xmath28 .",
    "the generating function is a convenient tool for analyzing models in which `` clusters '' decay independently to make the observed hadrons .",
    "the clusters can be low - mass objects such as those assumed in qcd monte carlo simulations at a low @xmath33 non - perturbative scale , or the hypothetical objects in branching models , or any of the large number of hadronic resonances that are the immediate ancestors of most observed hadrons .",
    "the connection is as follows : if @xmath34 is the probability to produce @xmath10 clusters and @xmath35 is the probability for a cluster to decay into @xmath10 particles , then the overall distribution of particles @xmath36 is given by the generating function relation @xmath37 assuming that the clusters decay independently .",
    "proof of this relation follows from the obvious expression : @xmath38 the proof is easily generalized to show @xmath39 for independent decay of independently - decaying clusters , etc .    a simple but useful special case of this theorem applies to detection efficiencies . if @xmath40 is the detection probability ( `` efficiency '' ) for a single particle , one can think of the particle as a ` cluster ' with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of the inefficiency can therefore be expressed by @xmath43 \\rightarrow g\\left [ 1 - q(1-x ) \\right]$ ] .",
    "the generating function is also a convenient tool for analyzing models in which the observed hadrons come from two or more statistically independent sources .",
    "an important example that we will use in sect .",
    "[ sec : backgroundevent ] occurs in simulation programs  and perhaps also in nature  where in addition to particles resulting from a qcd hard scattering and its associated radiation , there are particles in the final state known as the `` soft background event '' , from soft interactions between the other partons in the initial composite hadrons .",
    "this possibility of background particles leads to the notion of a _ survival probability _ for rapidity gaps @xcite .",
    "another example that is important for us are particles that appear far outside the cone of a jet , as a result of sequential decays of hadronic resonances produced inside the jet cone .",
    "the relevant theorem is as follows : if two independent sources have probability distributions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then both together result in @xmath46 proof follows directly from @xmath47 for the lowest multiplicities , eq .",
    "( [ eq : proof2 ] ) takes the obvious forms @xmath48 the theorem can be generalized to @xmath49 for combining @xmath50 independent sources .",
    "_ thus on a logarithmic scale , generating functions from independent sources are additive .",
    "_      intuitively , we want to make a smooth parametrization of the multiplicity distribution for @xmath51 , and extrapolate it to @xmath52 to see if there is an anomalous contribution that would signal rapidity gap physics .",
    "the parametrization is not a trivial matter , because @xmath28 varies rapidly with @xmath10 at small @xmath10 , especially for large rapidity intervals where @xmath2 is large .",
    "a representation of the probability distribution that i find to be useful describes it as a continuous superposition of poissons : @xmath53 the density function @xmath54 is the relative probability to have a poisson process of average multiplicity @xmath55 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath54 is the laplace transform of the generating function : @xmath56 the moments of the continuous distribution @xmath54 are the factorial moments : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and in general @xmath59    the independent sources theorem eq .",

    ". the two free parameters of the nbd suffice to fit the first two moments @xmath73 and @xmath90 , and hence the nbd can provide at least a qualitative description of the probabilities @xmath28 where they are large .",
    "we will see , however , that a single nbd does not fit our distributions in detail .",
    "experimentally , the main published data on multiplicity distributions in very high energy hadron - hadron collisions are those of ua5 for charged particles in minimum bias non - diffractive events at @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the data for rapidity intervals @xmath92 are well described by nbd distributions . for @xmath93 ,",
    "the data are close to nbd , although the nbd fits are not statistically acceptable . however , these data come from only a few thousand events , and therefore have rather large statistical errors where @xmath28 is small",
    ". they also have large systematic errors at low multiplicity , where efficiencies are hard to determine .",
    "hence the nbd form might not be magic .",
    "nbd distributions have also been seen in other data , including @xmath94 @xcite and nucleus - nucleus with low statistics @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of multiplicity distributions in minimum bias and/or various hard - scattering processes at the tevatron has yet to be carried through , although preliminary results from cdf have been presented @xcite .",
    "some useful information has been obtained by e735 @xcite .",
    "it would seem that d could directly extend the measurements of ua5 to @xmath7 , since their lack of a magnetic field simplifies the tracking of charged particles at low momentum .",
    "the qcd monte carlo program herwig 5.7 @xcite was used to simulate @xmath95 scattering at the fermilab tevatron energy @xmath7 , for final states that contain two relatively high @xmath5 jets separated widely in rapidity .",
    "we will examine the multiplicity distribution in the interval between these two `` trigger jets '' .    specifically , we require two jets with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "we require there to be no additional jet with @xmath101 elsewhere in the event .",
    "the jets are defined by a cone algorithm that i have used previously @xcite , with a cone radius of @xmath102 in lego .",
    "this configuration is interesting for gap physics .",
    "it is also a good one to study from an experimental standpoint , because the region between the jets , in which the multiplicity is to be measured , is in the best region of the detectors .",
    "indeed d has already published data for a rather similar configuration @xcite , and further data from both d @xcite and cdf @xcite will be forthcoming .    in leading - order qcd ,",
    "the exchange of transverse momentum between the partons that produce the trigger jets is accompanied by an exchange of color . as a result ,",
    "one expects lots of gluon radiation , and hence average multiplicities greater than those seen in minimum bias events , in the interval between the jets .",
    "however , if color - singlet exchanges are significant , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the form of gluon ladders , one can also expect to observe some events with rapidity gaps @xcite .",
    "herwig includes all possible qcd @xmath103 tree diagrams for the hard scattering . among these diagrams ,",
    "gluon exchange dominates over quark exchange because of the large rapidity separation and the gluon s higher spin .",
    "also , the scattering partons are mainly @xmath104 and @xmath105 because the large sub - energy @xmath106 \\cong p_{\\perp}^{(1 ) } \\ , p_{\\perp}^{(2 ) } \\ , e^{|\\eta^{(1 ) } - \\eta^{(2)}| } \\label{eq : shat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] requires them to have large momentum fractions @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which are suppressed more strongly for gluons by the parton distribution functions .",
    "herwig is appropriate for this simulation because it correctly includes the color structure of the qcd hard scattering .",
    "it also includes the production of many of the actual low - mass hadronic resonances , which have an important influence on the multiplicity distribution .",
    "a final important feature is that the program contains no color - singlet exchange , or pomeron physics in any other form , so it provides a clean model for the _ background _ to rapidity gaps .",
    "the most recent version 5.7 of herwig @xcite was used , with its default parameter values except for @xmath109 to suit our desired jet @xmath5 s , and @xmath110 which will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : backgroundevent ] .",
    "it was necessary to modify the off - the - shelf program to remove unphysical behavior that otherwise appears for our rare final state , as follows .",
    "the underlying @xmath103 cross section in herwig is evaluated for on - mass - shell partons .",
    "but the partons are actually off shell as a result of the initial state radiation branchings that are a principal feature of the program . to enforce a reasonable consistency , we reject events for which the squared four - momentum of either initial parton is larger in magnitude than @xmath111 a symmetric measure of the hardness of the scattering .",
    "events in which either observed jet axis differs by more than @xmath112 in rapidity from the scattered parton ( @xmath113 ) responsible for it are also rejected .",
    "this cut removes only @xmath114 of the events .",
    "it guarantees that the trigger jets , which are the two largest @xmath5 jets in the event , come from the underlying hard scattering , as they should to be consistent with the approximations on which the simulation is based .",
    "the herwig program was modified to improve its efficiency for generating events that satisfy our cuts , with no further change in content , by replacing its uniformly random generation of the two final rapidities in the @xmath103 subprocess with an appropriately peaked one .",
    "this of course required the event weighting to be handled by the user s program .",

    "this fit has a good @xmath121 , and continues to fit at larger values of @xmath10 ( not shown ) , all the way out to @xmath126 , beyond which statistical errors become overwhelming .",
    "the fit consists of a sum of two nbd terms .",
    "however , the density function representation @xmath54 in fig .",
    "2 ( solid curve ) shows that these two terms do not describe distinct peaks , but rather overlap to form a single very smooth distribution .",
    "the distribution is qualitatively similar to , but somewhat narrower than , the single nbd approximation ( dashed curve ) .",
    "although the solid curve in fig .",
    "1 is a smooth fit to the @xmath125 data , its extrapolation to @xmath52 is @xmath127 , which underestimates the actual @xmath128 by a factor of @xmath129 .",
    "_ this raises a warning flag for rapidity gap searches , where the signal would correspond to just such an `` extra '' probability for @xmath52 ! _",
    "a similar but even stronger effect occurs if all particles are included instead of just those with @xmath130 : the actual value is @xmath131 while the extrapolation gives @xmath132 .",
    "similar behavior also occurs if the interval is defined using true rapidity @xmath133 in place of @xmath134 : @xmath135 , @xmath136 ; or for a larger interval such as @xmath137 : @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "the effect is present but somewhat smaller if only charged particles with @xmath138 are counted : @xmath139 , @xmath140 , or if charged particles with all @xmath5 are counted : @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "the effect remains if all hadron resonances are made stable instead of being allowed to decay : in the interval @xmath133 we have @xmath143 , @xmath144 , or in the longer interval @xmath145 we have @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "these results indicate that in order to establish a rapidity gap signal experimentally , the signal will have to be large compared to the background estimated by extrapolation from larger @xmath10 , since the extrapolation can underestimate the non - pomeron contribution .    the dotted curve in fig .",
    "2 shows the density function for a parametrization that fits @xmath36 in fig .  1 for all @xmath10 .",

    "events of the type we are interested in , where two partons interact to produce jets , will generally occur only in collisions for which the impact parameter is small .",
    "there are likely to be additional soft interactions between other constituents , of the same character as those of the typical `` minimum - bias '' interactions that account for the fact that the inelastic interaction probability is nearly @xmath112 at small impact parameter .",
    "these additional interactions lead to the production of particles known as the `` soft background event '' , which raise @xmath2 and decrease @xmath62 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the soft background particles are statistically independent from the particles we have considered so far .",

    "the lorentz frame - specific pseudo - rapidity @xmath15 and the true rapidity @xmath193 are related by @xmath194 these become equal for @xmath195 , as is always the case for the massless photon ; while particles whose transverse momentum is small compared to their masses are swept out to @xmath196 .",
    "apparently have ignored this pseudo - rapidity phenomenon when extrapolating to account for the unmeasured portion of the spectrum at small @xmath5 .",
    "they also use a phenomenological form @xmath197 which has incorrect analytic behavior in @xmath198 : @xmath199 would be preferable . ] imposing the cut @xmath115 eliminates much of this pseudo - rapidity effect , and changes the composition to @xmath200 @xmath18 , @xmath201 @xmath17 , @xmath202 @xmath190 , and @xmath203 @xmath192 .",
    "a benefit of imposing the minimum @xmath5 cut , in addition to experimental convenience , is that it tends to eliminate particles whose pseudo - rapidities are unrepresentative of the actual underlying physics .",
    "for example , low @xmath5 photons generally come from the decay of a @xmath19 whose true rapidity differs from that of the photon by something on the order of @xmath170 units .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath19 may come from the decay of a @xmath204 or other low - mass resonance that is still further away ; and that resonance may itself be a resonance decay product . from the standpoint of rapidity gap physics",
    ", one would like to think of @xmath205 , @xmath206 , or higher - mass resonances alike as stable .",
    "decay effects are simply a source of `` noise '' in the measurement of the rapidity of produced hadrons .",
    "this noise is significant because the intervals we are looking at are not very many units long in rapidity .",
    "the herwig simulation leads to the following quantitative results for the @xmath155 interval .",
    "if all particles are included , @xmath207 come from parent particles or resonances produced outside the corresponding interval @xmath133 of true rapidity .",
    "this includes @xmath203 from parents that are more than @xmath170 units outside the interval .",
    "imposing the cut @xmath115 improves the situation considerably : only @xmath202 come from parents outside the true interval @xmath133 , with only @xmath208 more than @xmath170 units outside it .",
    "rapidity gaps are traditionally defined by a total absence of particles in a particular interval of pseudo - rapidity .",
    "we should not be single - minded about this , however , since as shown above , neglecting particles with @xmath209 substantially improves the connection between the pseudo - rapidities of the long - lived or stable particles that are measured and the true rapidities of their parent hadrons .",
    "an additional motive for neglecting low @xmath5 particles , aside from experimental practicality , is the following : the theoretically significant variables in rapidity gap physics are generally the invariant masses of the hadronic systems to the left and right of the gap .",
    "these masses depend on the `` @xmath210 '' and `` @xmath211 '' components of light - cone momentum , @xmath212 , for which particles with very low @xmath5 are less important .",
    "the ideal way to look for rapidity gaps would be to measure the multiplicity zero component @xmath62 as a function of interval size @xmath213 .",
    "the background from non - gap physics should decline rapidly with increasing @xmath213for example , @xmath214 roughly describes the results of our simulation in the range @xmath215 .",
    "any residual constant or slowly varying component at large @xmath213 is the rapidity gap signal .",
    "because current experiments are limited in interval size , and because it is necessary to make experimental corrections based on measurements at non - zero @xmath10 , we have studied instead the form of the @xmath28 distribution in fixed regions of @xmath213 .",
    "one can hope that for @xmath216 , the rapidity gap signal will appear as an anomalously large contribution to @xmath62 , when compared to a smooth parameterization that describes the rest of the distribution .    with the help of the qcd simulation program herwig , we have found suitable ways to parametrize the @xmath28 distribution . a particularly convenient choice is a sum of two nbd terms , which gives a very good fit , and automatically provides a simple parametrization of the generating function @xmath23 and the poisson density function @xmath217 .",
    "the smoothness of the parametrization is demonstrated by the smooth single - peak form of @xmath54 ( figs .  2 , 4 ) .",
    "the absence of an anomalous contribution ( or a gap signal ) at very small @xmath10 can be characterized by a power - law behavior @xmath218 where @xmath219 so that @xmath220 . meanwhile , the often - used single nbd form has this property , and describes the distribution qualitatively ( fig .",
    "3a ) ; but is not good enough at small @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "3b ) for measuring the background to a rapidity gap signal unless the region of @xmath10 included in the fit is sharply restricted .",
    "we find from the simulation that fits to @xmath28 for @xmath221 can underestimate @xmath62 by a factor @xmath222 .",
    "this is a cautionary tale for rapidity gap studies , because the excess @xmath62 has the same form as a rapidity gap signal . it will nevertheless be possible",
    "to measure true gap effects in intervals as small as @xmath223 units , _ provided _ the @xmath52 cross section turns out to be large compared to the extrapolation from larger @xmath10 .",
    "this will happen if the signal turns out to be on the order of @xmath208 or larger .",
    "results from the experiments are eagerly awaited !    further work is needed to create a phenomenological model to describe the rapidity gap physics itself , which contributes not only to @xmath52 , but also to other low multiplicities since the gap in a given event can be just slightly shorter than the rapidity interval under consideration , and since there are edge effects associated with resonance decays as discussed in sect .",
