    "let s start with a lofty goal : we strive for the mastery of a non - perturbative strongly coupled theory : qcd .",
    "couplings in field theory do not typically have to be weak .",
    "indeed , strong interactions are the expected phenomena if one reaches beyond the standard model .",
    "it will therefore be of great benefit if we can understand the effects of strong couplings in qcd .",
    "high precision predictions of qcd will also remove road blocks for many weak and flavor physics measurements .",
    "lattice qcd has matured over the last decade .",
    "we finally can expect the first non - perturbative qcd results with 1 - 3% errors .",
    "cleo - c will provide crucial data in a timely fashion to validate them and help guide the theory on its long way from easier predictions to a full understanding of non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "this will result , for example , in improved measurements of @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the 1% level .",
    "cleo - c data will also provide a large number of basic measurements needed in heavy flavor physics and future efforts in understanding physics beyond the standard model .",
    "a detailed description can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we plan to acquire the cleo - c data in a 3 year program .",
    "the use of present and future cleo data sets will be considered in the course of this paper .",
    "the expected size of the data sets are shown in table  [ tabledatasets ] .",
    "cleo - c intends to accumulate 30 x 10@xmath5 events at @xmath6 and about 1.5 x 10@xmath5 events at @xmath7(4140 ) .",
    "the number of expected @xmath1 events is uncertain within a factor of two because of conflicting earlier measurements .",
    "this will be clarified with an early scan , which will determine the point of largest @xmath1 production .",
    "we expect to collect a total of about one billion @xmath2 events .",
    "smaller data sets are considered at the @xmath8 threshold ( 3557 mev ) at the @xmath9(3686 ) at @xmath10 threshold ( 5200 mev ) and a scan over the full 3 - 7 gev region .    in 2002 , before lowering the energy to the charm sector , cleo plans to collect data at the three narrow 1s , 2s and 3s @xmath11 resonances with an integrated luminosity of about 1fb@xmath12 each .",
    "the cleoii and cleoiii data sets gathered at the @xmath11(4s ) contain a large number of 2-photon events .",
    "[ tabledatasets ]    .size of datasets considered in the discussion of this paper .",
    "the data at the @xmath11(4s ) represents the cleoii and cleoiii data sets .",

    "we can expect lattice qcd calculations with an error of @xmath21t@xmath22/t@xmath22 = 3% within a few years as discussed further below .",
    "this will result in a precision for |v@xmath23| of 1.7% . in a similar way",
    ",    ckm matrix elements can also be extracted from leptonic decays . combining leptonic and semileptonic measurements we expect final precisions of 1.4% and 1.1% on |v@xmath23| and",
    "starting late fall 2001 cleo will collect about 1 fb@xmath12 on each of the @xmath11(1s ) - @xmath11(3s ) resonances .",
    "most present theories  @xcite indicate that the ground state of the @xmath11 system , the @xmath25 , could be discovered via the hindered m1 transition from the @xmath11(3s ) state .",
    "one also would expect to see the decay @xmath11(3s)@xmath26h@xmath27",
    "if found , its large predicted decay branching fraction into @xmath25 of 50% opens a further avenue to observe the @xmath25 .",
    "cleo also should be able to observe the 1@xmath28d@xmath29 states .",
    "the @xmath30 system is unique in that it has states with l=2 that lie below the open - flavor threshold .",
    "we expect unquenched lattice calculations soon for the center of gravity of the triplets of both d states to about @xmath315 mev .",
    "current theoretical calculations and our existing data suggest that we can expect 20 - 40 fully reconstructed events in the decay @xmath11(3s)@xmath32 @xmath33 , which should enable the extraction of the center of gravity of the triplet of the 1@xmath28d@xmath29 state to about 3 mev . from this ,",
    "the mass of the lowest state can be predicted and a scan can directly establish its mass , gaining a measure of the s - d mixing in the @xmath30 system .    in the j/@xmath7 system",
    "only very few states are measured with high precision .",
    "although we know the ground state @xmath34 , its width is measured very poorly .",
    "the @xmath35 and h@xmath36 states need confirmation .",
    "the @xmath37d@xmath29 and 2@xmath37p@xmath29 states still have to be found .",
    "the region above the @xmath0 threshold is generally explored very little , despite the fact that a lot of interesting physics might be extracted if one could identify , for example , charmed hybrid states .",
    "cleo - c will have to make a scan in order to find the energy with the largest @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "a more detailed scan between 3.6 gev and 5 gev is also considered .",
    "lattice qcd is a full implementation of qcd and can therefore in principle produce accurate results , also for the low energy phenomena that can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "it has , however , failed to make good predictions with well understood errors because of technical difficulties  @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", some real breakthroughs have been achieved  @xcite , so that we can expect some of the theoretically easier calculations to appear in the next few years with sound error estimates of 1 - 2% .",
    "in general , one was able to incorporate known features of qcd into the lattice calculations .",
    "perturbation theory is used to describe short distance physics and connect the lattice to the continuum .",
    "second order results lead to relative errors of o(@xmath38 ) .",
    "one would like to keep lattice spacing as large as possible in order to minimize computer time . improved discretizations remove errors by adding correction terms . these and other improvements are required in order that one can finally get unquenched results , which include effects from @xmath39 loops . when this can be done with realistic d , u - quark masses , the errors on the results become quantifiable and errors of order 2% are achievable for many calculations .",
    "examples are masses , decay constants , semileptonic form factors , and mixing amplitudes for d , d@xmath22 , d@xmath40 , d@xmath41 , b , b@xmath22 , b@xmath40 , b@xmath41 , and corresponding baryons ; masses , leptonic widths , electromagnetic form factors , and mixing amplitudes for any meson in @xmath7 and @xmath11 families below the open flavor threshold .",
    "it should be stressed that lattice qcd can make all these predictions using only the quark masses and @xmath42 as input parameters .",
    "today there are not enough measurements in the one percent region for the quantities mentioned above .",
    "cleo - c , however , will be able to provide most of them accurately enough , enabling us to validate the new lattice results and methods .",
    "particularly the measurements in the @xmath7 and @xmath11 region provide an excellent test ground .",
    "this validation is needed so that lattice qcd results can be trusted and used to increase the accuracy of theoretical predictions for many different aspects of physics .",
    "an immediate application of lattice qcd results by cleo - c involves the extraction of |v@xmath43| and |v@xmath23| by the use of the meson decay form factor and the measurement of leptonic decay branching fractions of d and d@xmath22 , as well as the semileptonic form factors and the measurement of the semileptonic decay branching fractions of d and d@xmath22 , described above .    even before a full validation of lattice qcd",
    ", measurements of the d - meson form factor will result in better predictions of the b - meson form factor , which will tighten the constraints on the unitarity triangle from @xmath44 and @xmath45 mixing measurements .",
    "using su(3 ) and heavy quark symmetry the semileptonic form factor for the process b@xmath46e@xmath47 can be predicted from the measurement of the semileptonic form factor extracted from the process d@xmath48k@xmath49e@xmath47 , which will result in an improved |v@xmath50| determination .",
    "finally , the impact of 2% theoretical errors on form factors produced by a validated lattice qcd theory are shown in figure  [ figunitaritytriangle ] using today s measurements .",
    "it is obvious that only an increased bound from |v@xmath50| and @xmath44 mixing results together with the sin(2@xmath51 ) measurements will be able to give a significant answer on the question if the unitarity triangle is indeed closed or if the effect of new physics is observed . the limits from the @xmath52 measurement will also be improved considerably .",
    "[ figunitaritytriangle ]",
    "lattice qcd will have answers for some questions in the near future , however there are many quantities that will remain difficult to calculate for some time .",
    "there are only some ideas on how to treat effects like mixing , or the inclusion of gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the important information that is needed to gain better understanding is the extraction of the relevant degrees of freedom of the strong interaction in the non - perturbative regime . a much better understanding of the light meson spectrum will be very helpful to gain this information and to guide the lattice",
    ".    an important advance will be if one could identify the @xmath53 states in the light meson sector .",
    "there are only a handful of @xmath53 states that are unambiguously known .",
    "however , they are needed in order to study complete nonets , and to discriminate @xmath39 against non-@xmath39 resonances .",
    "cleo - c will attempt to collect in the order of one billion j/@xmath7 decays .",
    "this data set will contain some 60 million radiative j/@xmath7 decays .",
    "this will be the first data set with large statistics well suited to do meson spectroscopy in the region of 1.6 to 2.6 gev .",
    "it should enable us to identify most of the @xmath53 states , since the initial state for radiative j/@xmath7 decays is well defined and the cleo detector will measure all final states simultaneously with 93% coverage in solid angle .",
    "another way of identifying @xmath53 states is via @xmath7 and @xmath54vf flavor tagging .",
    "lets say the vector state v might be reconstructed as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , or @xmath57 state .",
    "the particle f then will be dominantly a state of the same flavor as v due to the suppression of hair - pin diagrams .",
    "it has been said many times that identifying the @xmath39 states is required first in order to find left over states .",
    "further analysis is needed to determine if they are multiquark states , meson - antimeson molecules , hybrids ( qqg ) or glueballs . in practice",
    "however , these states can mix with the @xmath39 state .",
    "current data seem to indicate that we have such a case in the scalar sector with the f@xmath58(1400 ) , f@xmath58(1500 ) and f@xmath58(1710 ) , which are thought to be the mixtures of two @xmath39 states and the glueball , although there are a fair number of other ideas on how to identify the scalars .",
    "mixing to such a large degree does not have to be the typical case , and the idea of identifying the @xmath39 nonets should usually be possible .",
    "the scalar sector requires special attention .",
    "the cleo - c data set will be the only data set on the horizon that measures all three resonances simultaneously with high statistics and a well defined initial state .",
    "furthermore , the scalars should be observed in @xmath11(1s ) decays , with lower statistics but well defined initial states .",
    "however the data set that will best reveal the nature of the scalar resonances is the 2-photon data collected in the 25fb@xmath12 of cleoii and cleoiii data , since the coupling to glue is suppressed .",
    "therefore the two photon partial width of the scalar states should give us a handle on their glue content .",
    "one also expects hybrid states containing 2 quarks and a gluon as constituents .",
    "these are particularly interesting since there are hybrid states with quantum numbers not realized by @xmath39 states .",
    "the identification of a spectrum of hybrid states is very challenging , but has the reward to make unique measurements to test lattice qcd predictions .",
    "cleo - c has limited access to hybrid production from @xmath59 decays , enabling us to measure c - odd states as the 1@xmath60 exotic hybrid .",
    "since the radiative decay fraction of the @xmath61 is about 9% , a sizeable number of @xmath59 decays should be recorded .",
    "there are a large number of other measurements possible , which are part of the very diverse cleo - c program .",
    "there are just some highlights mentioned here . in @xmath62-physics",
    "we expect an improvement in the accuracy of our knowledge of the @xmath62-mass by a factor of three and of the michel parameter @xmath63 by a factor of four .",
    "we expect to detect many rare decays of the d@xmath64 and d@xmath65 meson or set limits on the order of a few times 10@xmath66 .",
    "cleo has the unique ability to perform an r - scan between 3 - 7 gev , which would require about 150 pb@xmath12 of data and could be acquired within one week .",
    "this is of importance because it is expected that the 3 - 7 gev region will otherwise become the region contributing dominantly to uncertainties in the determination of @xmath67(m@xmath68 ) and the hadronic contribution to ( g-2)@xmath69 .",
    "the cleo - c program has many exciting aspects .",
    "it is made unique , however , by the fact that it provides the data needed by an emerging lattice community to validate their new results to a level of a few percent .",
    "this combined effort should lead to a situation that many non - perturbative qcd calculations with well determined errors will be available in flavor physics and wherever they are needed to explore beyond the standard model .",
