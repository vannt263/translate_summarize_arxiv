    "although the presence of dark matter dominated haloes around spiral galaxies is well established ( e.g. van albada et al .",
    "1985 ) , there is still some controversy about their presence around early - type galaxies .",
    "spiral galaxies often contain large regular hi  discs , which allow us to obtain rotation curves out to large radii , and therefore we can constrain the properties of their dark haloes .",
    "but these discs are much rarer in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. bregman , hogg & roberts 1992 ) , so that for this class of galaxies we are often required to use other tracers to obtain velocity measurements , such as stellar kinematics , planetary nebulae or globular clusters .",
    "these tracers however are not available for all early - type galaxies , and give mixed results ( e.g. rix et al .",
    "1997 , romanowsky et al .",
    "2003 , bridges et al .",
    "2006 ) .    with the increase in sensitivity of radio telescopes",
    ", it has been discovered that many early - type galaxies in the field do contain hi   gas , though with smaller surface densities than in spiral galaxies ( e.g. morganti et al .",
    "2006 ) . the average hi  surface density in the morganti et al .",
    "sample is around @xmath4 pc@xmath5 , which is far below the typical value for spiral galaxies ( 4 - 8@xmath6 pc@xmath5 , e.g. cayatte et al .",
    "this would explain why previously only the most gas - rich early - type galaxies were detected in hi .",
    "morganti et al .",
    "find that hi  can be present in different morphologies : hi  discs seem to be as common as off - set clouds and tails , though they occur mostly in the relatively gas - rich systems .",
    "recently rotation curves of hi  discs in low surface brightness galaxies and dwarf galaxies , complemented with h@xmath7 observations , have been used not only to confirm the existence of dark matter haloes , but also to obtain estimates on the inner slope of the density profiles of the haloes ( e.g. van den bosch et al . 2000 ; weldrake , de blok & walter 2003 ) .",
    "simulations within a cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology yield haloes with cusps in their centres ( nfw profiles , see navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) , but observations suggest core - dominated profiles ( e.g. de blok & bosma 2002 ; de blok 2005 ) .    detailed studies of rotation curves of early - type galaxies that contain hi  discs are sparser , due to lack of spatial resolution : to detect low hi  surface densities , larger beams are needed . also , only few early - type galaxies have hi  discs that are extended and regular enough to allow for detailed studies . comparing @xmath3 values at large radii , derived from hi  velocities , to @xmath3 at smaller radii measured from ionised gas kinematics ,",
    "the conclusion is that early - type galaxies also have dark matter dominated haloes ( e.g. bertola et al .",
    "1993 ; morganti et al .",
    "1997 ; sadler et al .",
    "franx , van gorkom & de zeeuw ( 1994 ) used the hi  ring of the elliptical galaxy ic  2006 to determine not only the mass , but also the shape of the dark halo .",
    "they concluded that ic  2006 is surrounded by an axisymmetric dark halo , using the geometry of the ring and an harmonic expansion of its velocity map .    in this paper , we present a similar analysis of the regularly rotating hi  ring around the elliptical ( e4 ) field galaxy ngc  2974 .",
    "kim et al . ( 1988 ) observed this galaxy before in hi but their data had lower spatial resolution than ours , and they found a filled disc instead of a ring .",
    "cinzano & van der marel ( 1994 ) found an embedded stellar disc in their dynamical model of this galaxy , based upon long - slit spectroscopic data , but emsellem , goudfrooij & ferruit ( 2003 ) constructed a dynamical model of ngc  2974 based on tiger integral - field spectrography and long - slit stellar kinematics , that does not require a hidden disc structure .",
    "they did report the detection of a two - arm gaseous spiral in the inner 200 pc of ngc  2974 from high resolution wfpc2 imaging .",
    "krajnovi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) constructed axisymmetric dynamical models of both the stars and ionised gas based upon ` sauron `   integral - field data .",
    "these models require a component with high angular momentum , consisting of a somewhat flattened distribution of stars , though not a thin stellar disc .",
    "emsellem et al . (",
    "2007 ) classify ngc  2974 as a fast rotator , which means that it possesses large - scale rotation and that its angular momentum is well defined .",
    "some of the characteristics of ngc  2974 are given in table  [ tab : ngc2974 ] .",
    "for our analysis of ngc  2974 we combine kinematics of neutral gas , obtained from our observations with the very large array ( vla ) , with that of ionised gas , obtained with the integral - field spectrograph ` sauron `  ( bacon et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this combination of a small scale two - dimensional gas velocity map in the centre of the galaxy , and a hi  velocity map at the outskirts , allows measurements of a rotation curve ranging from 100 pc within the centre of the galaxy to 10 kpc at the edges of the hi  ring .",
    "we use this rotation curve , together with ground- and space based optical imaging , to determine the dark matter content in ngc  2974 , and to constrain the shape of the dark halo .    in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the two datasets and their reduction , and describe the hi  ring .",
    "we concentrate on the analysis of the velocity maps in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the rotation curve that we extract from the velocity maps , and in section 5 we show mass models with various halo models , and find the best fit to the rotation curve .",

    "( 2006 ) . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      an alternative to including a dark matter halo in a galaxy to explain its rotation curve at large radii , is provided by modified newtonian dynamics ( mond , milgrom 1983 ) . in this theory ,",
    "newtonian dynamics is no longer valid for small accelerations ( @xmath8 ) , but instead the acceleration @xmath9 in a gravitational field is given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the newtonian acceleration and @xmath12 is an interpolation function , such that @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 . given the stellar mass - to - light ratio of a galaxy , mond predicts its rotation curve .",
    "an overview of properties and predictions of mond is offered by sanders & mcgaugh ( 2002 ) .",
    "we fitted our rotation curve of ngc  2974 with @xmath17 as a free parameter . for @xmath18",
    "we adopted the value of @xmath19 cm / s@xmath20 , which was derived by begeman , broeils & sanders ( 1991 ) from a sample of spiral galaxies .",
    "the contribution of the neutral gas is included in our model in the same way as described before , as well as a convolution to take seeing and sampling into account .",
    "ngc  2974 is an ideal candidate to study the transition between the newtonian and mond regime , since the newtonian acceleration reaches @xmath18 at a radius of approximately @xmath21 if we adopt a stellar mass - to - light ratio of 2.34 @xmath1 . for larger",
    "@xmath17 , this radius increases , and for the maximum disc value of 3.8 @xmath1 , @xmath18 is reached around @xmath22 .",
    "this means that a large part of the observed rotation curve lies in the transition region , and we could therefore use ngc  2974 to discriminate between interpolation function .",
    "we first constructed a model with the standard interpolation function of mond ,    @xmath23    the resulting fit is shown as model i in figure  [ fig : mond ] . this model has the same @xmath17 value as the maximal disc model , 3.8 @xmath1 , but does clearly not provide a good fit to the data .",
    "we constructed a second model , with an alternative interpolation function explored by famaey & binney ( 2005 ) ,    @xmath24    this function makes the transition between the newtonian and the mond region less abrupt than the standard interpolation function and requires a lower @xmath17 .",
    "the fit provided by this model to the data is much better ( model ii in figure  [ fig : mond ] ) , but formally less good than a model with a dark matter halo .",
    "this model requires @xmath253.6 @xmath1 , and the fit yields @xmath26 , for 27 - 1 degrees of freedom .",
    "famaey & binney ( 2005 ) find that their simple interpolation function provides better constraints to the terminal velocity of the milky way than the standard function .",
    "famaey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) fitted the rotation curves of a sample of galaxies with hubble types ranging from small irregular dwarf galaxies to large early - type spirals , and report that both interpolating functions fit the data equally well .",
    "however , sanders & noordermeer ( 2007 ) find that for their sample of early - type disc galaxies the simple interpolation function yields more sensible values for @xmath27 than the standard one .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether there is a preference for the simple interpolation function over the standard one in early - type galaxies . in this scenario ,",
    "the challenge for mond would be to provide a universal interpolation function that would fit rotation curves of all galaxy types along the hubble sequence .",
    "so far , mostly spirals and dwarf galaxies have been confronted with mond , but with more early - type galaxies getting detected in hi  and more rotation curves becoming available , the sampling in morphology should become less biased to late - type galaxies .",
    "we obtained hi  observations of the early - type galaxy ngc  2974 and found that the neutral gas resides in a ring .",
    "the ring starts around 50@xmath28 , and extends to 120@xmath28 , which corresponds to 12 kpc or 5 effective radii .",
    "the total mass of the neutral gas is @xmath29 .",
    "we compared the velocity field of the hi  ring with the kinematics of the ionised gas .",
    "we found that both velocity fields are very regular and nicely aligned , indicating that they could form a single disc .",
    "a harmonic decomposition of the velocity field showed that at large radii the gravitational potential is consistent with an axisymmetric shape .",
    "we introduced a new way to correct the rotation curve of the ionised gas for asymmetric drift .",
    "we found that the correction approaches a constant value and this enabled us to remove the effect of turbulence on the rotation curve , assuming a constant asymmetric drift correction throughout the galaxy .",
    "we confirmed that this assumption is valid in ngc  2974 , by comparing with the asymmetric drift corrected rotation curve of the stars ( which was not affected by turbulence ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether other galaxies show the same behaviour .",
    "if this is the case , then with our method we would be able to investigate rotation curves of ionised gas and the effects of turbulence in more detail in other galaxies , and search for connections with e.g. spiral structure and bars .",
    "although in principle we could for ngc  2974 also have used the stellar rotation curve together with the hi  to constrain the mass models , this will not be the case for all galaxies .",
    "for instance , in low surface brightness galaxies stellar kinematics are not easy to obtain , and even in high surface brightness galaxies , the absorption line kinematics need to be binned to higher signal - to - noise than the emission line kinematics , provided that ionised gas is present .",
    "it is clear from the rotation curve of ngc  2974 that dark matter is required to explain the observed velocities.we found that the total mass - to - light ratio increases from 4.3 @xmath1 at 1 @xmath2 to 8.5 @xmath1 at 5 @xmath2 .",
    "this last value would correspond to 14 @xmath30 in @xmath31-band . even in the maximal disc model ,",
    "55 per cent of the total mass is dark , and an additional dark halo needs to be included .",
    "we constructed mass models of ngc  2974 , where we modeled both the stellar and gaseous contribution to the gravitational potential .",
    "the latter is negligible compared to the stars ( @xmath32 ) , but still included in our models .",
    "for the dark halo , we tested two different profiles : the core - dominated pseudo - isothermal sphere and the cuspy nfw profile .",
    "we experimented with different values for the stellar mass - to - light ratio , but found that we can not constrain this value with just the rotation curve : for most @xmath27 smaller than the maximal disc value , we could obtain a decent fit for both the pseudo - isothermal sphere and the nfw profile . if we compare models with @xmath17 from single stellar population models ( 2.34 @xmath1 ) with maximal disc model ( @xmath25 3.8 @xmath1 ) , then the first provide better fits to the data .",
    "especially the inner datapoints are better reproduced with @xmath33 2.34 @xmath1 , but we note that the hi  data points are better fitted in the models with the larger @xmath17 value .",
    "the pseudo - isothermal sphere fits our data marginally better than the nfw profile , but the difference is not significant",
    ". with mond we can also reproduce the observed rotation curve , but not as well as with models that include a dark matter halo .",
    "the largest uncertainty in our analysis is the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we can only derive an upper limit on this ratio from the maximal disc model or e.g. from schwarzschild modeling , since @xmath27 should always be equal to or smaller than the dynamical @xmath3 .",
    "values for @xmath27 from stellar population synthesis models depend significantly on the model assumptions : we mentioned already that going from a kroupa to a salpeter imf can increase @xmath27 by as much as 40 per cent .",
    "also , even low - level secondary star formation can affect @xmath27 severely .",
    "furthermore , there is no reason why the @xmath27 should remain constant over 5 effective radii , which we assumed when modeling the stellar mass .",
    "if the stellar mass - to - light ratio were known , we would be able to determine the dark matter fraction in the galaxy with more accuracy , and either rule out or confirm the maximal disc hypothesis . also , since @xmath27 is the only free parameter when fitting a rotation curve in mond , knowing this value would provide us with a rotation curve that can be compared to the data directly , providing a clear test for mond .",
    "we have shown in this paper that it is possible to combine rotation curves of neutral and ionised gas , correcting the latter one for asymmetric drift using the jeans equations and the higher order velocity moments of the collisionless boltzmann equations . our method to correct for the asymmetric drift therefore does not require a cold disc assumption ( @xmath34 ) . with more early - type galaxies getting detected in hi , and more high quality rotation curves becoming available",
    ", we can now study the shape of their dark matter haloes .",

    ", we see that the expressions in equations  ( [ eq : sigphisigr ] ) and ( [ eq : sigzsigr ] ) simplify slightly : in the first expression the one - to - last term disappears , and for the second one , @xmath78 gets replaced by @xmath79 in the nominator of the expression .",
    "furthermore , the derivative of @xmath80 simplifies considerably .",
    "the one - to - last term vanishes in the case of a velocity ellipsoid symmetric around @xmath82 .",
    "this need not necessarily be the case , and the exact form of @xmath83 depends on the underlying distribution function , which in general can not be constrained easily ( e.g. kuijken & tremaine 1991 ) .",
    "however , since this term is a factor @xmath84 smaller than the other terms , it can be safely ignored for most purposes .      here",
    "we investigate how in the thin disc approximation we can correct our observed velocity field for asymmetric drift , to obtain the true circular velocity @xmath85 .",
    "this quantity traces the potential and therefore the mass of the galaxy .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain @xmath66 from the observed velocity field , and though @xmath90 can be estimated rather well , @xmath91 is less easy to constrain",
    ". therefore , we fit to @xmath66 the prescription of evans & de zeeuw ( 1994 ) for power - law models :                  assuming that the velocity ellipsoid is symmetric around @xmath101 the corresponding term in equation  ( [ eq : adc2 ] ) vanishes . inserting the relations obtained from the power - law model , we arrive at the following expression for the circular velocity :"
