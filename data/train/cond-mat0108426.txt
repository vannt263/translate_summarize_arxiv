    "during the last decade clusters have attracted a lot of attention because of their interesting and novel properties@xcite . of particular interest",
    "are the binary clusters of hydrogen and silicon which are thought to be present in hydrogenated amorphous silicon(_a_-si : h ) , porous silicon and silicon surfaces .",
    "in addition to the fundamental interest , their study may throw some light on complex phenomena occurring in these systems .",
    "hydrogen plays an important role in these systems in phenomena like photoluminescence of porous silicon , potential fluctuations and the staebler - wronski effect in hydrogenated amorphous silicon(_a_-si : h)@xcite-@xcite . to understand these phenomena it is important to study how the addition of hydrogen affects the local electronic structure and geometry in these systems@xcite , @xcite .",
    "since these systems are very difficult to handle computationally , some understanding in this regard can be gained by simpler calculations on small hydrogenated silicon clusters . with this motivation ,",
    "we have carried out a detailed study of ground state structures and electronic properties of small si@xmath0h clusters ( 2@xmath11 ) using the car - parrinello molecular dynamics(cpmd ) , focusing particularly on the effects caused by hydrogen . in our study we have investigated : ( 1 ) ground state geometries of si@xmath0h clusters , ( 2 ) effect of hydrogen on the geometry of a silicon cluster , ( 3 ) stability of a silicon cluster due to the addition of hydrogen , ( 4 ) the first excited electronic level gaps of si@xmath0h and si@xmath0 clusters , ( 5 ) bonding nature and position of hydrogen in silicon clusters and ( 6 ) the lowest energy fragmentation products of si@xmath12h and si@xmath0 clusters .",
    "several calculations have been done for many silicon hydrogen clusters by using various techniques . using the car - parrinello method , onida and",
    "andreoni@xcite studied the ground state geometry and electronic structure of hydrogen passivated crystalline fragments of silicon such as si@xmath4h@xmath13 , si@xmath6h@xmath14 , si@xmath8h@xmath8 , si@xmath10h@xmath14 and si@xmath15h@xmath16 .",
    "they found that si - si bond lengths were insensitive to size effects , but electronic properties were strongly affected .",
    "they also found that homo - lumo gaps were not simply related to the size of the clusters and the localization of electronic states near the gaps was not necessarily silicon - like , even though the clusters are crystal fragments of silicon passivated by hydrogen .",
    "quantum chemical calculations of si@xmath0h@xmath17 clusters were carried out by meleshko _ _ et al__@xcite for _ _ n__=6 - 16 and _ m _ ranging from 2 to 20 .",
    "they found that each h atom was bonded with only one silicon atom and localized outside the silicon skeleton and that the packing density in the skeleton decreased as the hydrogen content of the cluster increased .",
    "_ et al__@xcite performed density functional calculations for small hydrogenated silicon clusters of si@xmath6h@xmath18 ( 0@xmath1914 ) and showed that for the sequence si@xmath6h@xmath20 + h@xmath2 @xmath21 si@xmath6h@xmath18 , the attachment of h occurred not at the site of silicon having dangling bonds but at the site where the lumo of si@xmath6h@xmath18 has a large amplitude for _ _ x__=2 and 6 .",
    "according to this calculation , the bonding interaction of _ 1s _ orbitals of hydrogen atoms with the lumo of si@xmath6h@xmath20 should be the major cause of stabilization of the clusters .",
    "their explanation makes it clear that hydrogen does not simply attach with silicon to saturate the dangling bonds , but it interacts at electronic level .",
    "swihart _ _ et al__@xcite used _ ab initio _ molecular orbital calculations to investigate structure and energetics of selected hydrogenated silicon clusters containing six to ten silicon atoms .",
    "the clusters investigated were those that played the most important role in particle nucleation@xcite in silane during chemical vapor deposition .",
    "et al _ @xcite modeled the dissociation of neutral and positively charged si@xmath0 clusters in _ _ n__@xmath2226 range .",
    "they used dissociation energies to test the results of global optimization and fragmentation products of the clusters . recently , non - orthogonal tight - binding molecular dynamics(ntbmd ) with simulated annealing optimization method was used to calculate ground state geometries of small si@xmath0h clusters@xcite ( 2@xmath2310 ) and si@xmath2h@xmath17(__n__=1 , 2 and _ _ m__=2 - 6 ) clusters@xcite , @xcite . using the non - orthogonal tight binding method ,",
    "genetic algorithm optimizations were carried out for si@xmath12h@xmath24 clusters(__n__=1 , 2 and _ _ m__=2 - 6)@xcite , @xcite .",
    "experimental studies have been carried out for hydrogenated silicon clusters using a quadrupole ion trap@xcite where si@xmath0h@xmath25(__n__=2 - 10 and _ _ x__=0 - 20 ) were grown from silane gas . from the mass spectra of these clusters , it was shown how the stability of a silicon cluster is affected by hydrogenation .",
    "our cpmd calculations show that hydrogen does not cause any drastic change in the geometry of the host silicon cluster although there is some distortion to the structure .",
    "to see clearly how the addition of a hydrogen atom affects the structure , stability and electronic properties of the host silicon cluster , we have also done a number of calculations for host silicon clusters .",
    "we have discussed two kinds of stabilities , one is geometrical stability and the other is electronic . to examine the geometrical stability of an si@xmath0 cluster@xcite-@xcite , we have calculated the difference between the total energy of modified si@xmath0 geometry which is obtained by removal of hydrogen from si@xmath0h cluster and ground state energy of si@xmath0 cluster .",
    "this energy difference gives information about the modification of the host silicon geometry due to the addition of hydrogen . to examine the electronic stability of si@xmath0h cluster we have calculated the first excited electronic level gap for si@xmath0h clusters .",
    "comparison of the first excited electronic level gaps of si@xmath0 clusters and si@xmath0h clusters shows that hydrogen , in general , brings electronic stability to silicon clusters .",
    "we have also calculated the lowest energy fragmentation products of si@xmath0 and si@xmath0h clusters .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section * ii * we give computational details of the present work . in section * iii * the ground state geometries are presented and discussed in detail . in section * iv * we discuss the stability , cohesive energies , total energy differences between clusters , the first excited electronic level gaps and the lowest energy fragmentation products of si@xmath0h and si@xmath0 clusters .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section * v*.",
    "we have used the car - parrinello molecular dynamics(cpmd)@xcite , @xcite with simulated annealing optimization technique to find the ground state structures of si@xmath0 and si@xmath0h clusters .",
    "the cpmd method combines the density functional formalism with the molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "this scheme allows us to describe dynamics of ions under action of forces calculated by the hellman - feynman theorem .",
    "the pseudopotentials for silicon and hydrogen have been generated using the bachelet , hamann and schl@xmath26ter technique@xcite .",
    "the local density approximation(lda ) of the density functional theory has been used with the ceperley - alder@xcite exchange - correlation energy functional parameterized by perdew and zunger@xcite .",
    "the wave functions were expanded in a plane wave basis with 12 rydberg energy cut - off and * * k**=0 point was used for brillouin zone sampling . during simulation volume of the system was kept constant and to avoid interaction between the clusters a big fcc supercell with side length of 35 a.u . was used . to perform simulated annealing ,",
    "the system was taken to high temperatures ( 1200k in the steps of 300k ) , equilibiriated for a long time ( about 16,000 steps ) and then slowly cooled down ( in the steps of 50k ) to 300k .",
    "below this temperature the steepest descent optimization was found to be more efficient to obtain the ground state geometry . to check the upper limit of temperature ,",
    "some of the clusters were heated up to 1500k and 2000k and it was found that the resulting ground state structures were the same .",
    "the desired temperature was achieved by rescaling atomic velocities and the atoms were moved according to the velocity verlet algorithm@xcite with a time step of 5 a.u .",
    "the fictitious mass of the electron was taken to be 200 a.u .",
    "all calculations were performed with more than one initial condition .",
    "the initial structures for md calculations were chosen without any pre - assumption about the ground state geometry of the cluster .",
    "the starting atomic configurations were chosen arbitrarily with a constraint that atoms were neither very far away from each other nor too close@xcite , @xcite . as mentioned above these clusters were then heated to high temperatures and then equilibiriated for a very long time . at this stage",
    "we find that the geometry of the hot cluster does not have any resemblance with the initial structure .",
    "at least two such cpmd calculations were performed for each cluster .",
    "for some clusters we have done cpmd calculation with three(si@xmath27h ) and four ( si@xmath28h ) starting atomic configurations and found that the final structures are the same .",
    "furthermore , we performed the cpmd with steepest descent optimizations on the ntbmd structures and found that the resulting geometries either converge to our structures or get stuck in some local minima .",
    "the ground state structures of si@xmath0 ( 2@xmath11 ) clusters obtained by us using the cpmd are similar to that obtained by previous calculations@xcite , @xcite . also our result for bond length of sih cluster(1.583 ) is close to the earlier cpmd result@xcite and other calculations@xcite .",
    "this shows that our calculational procedure is able to give correct structures .    the first excited electronic level gap ( @xmath29 @xmath30-@xmath29@xmath31 ) of a cluster is calculated by transferring a small charge from its ground state configuration to its first excited state , and is given by@xcite    @xmath29 @xmath30-@xmath29@xmath31 = @xmath32e@xmath33 @xmath32q    where @xmath34e is the difference between the total energy when @xmath34q amount of charge is transferred to the first excited state and total energy of the ground state .",
    "in this section we discuss in detail the ground state geometries of si@xmath0h clusters obtained by the cpmd@xcite with simulated annealing and steepest descent optimizations . by comparing our ground state geometry of si@xmath0h cluster with si@xmath0 cluster",
    ", we have investigated the effect of hydrogen on the geometry of the host silicon cluster .",
    "furthermore , we have compared our ground state geometries of si@xmath0h clusters with earlier calculated geometries of si@xmath0f@xcite and si@xmath0na@xcite clusters .",
    "we have also made a detailed comparison of our work with earlier ntbmd@xcite work .",
    "it agrees with our geometries of si@xmath2h , si@xmath3h , si@xmath5h and si@xmath10h but the remaining geometries are different from our geometries , particularly the position and bonding of hydrogen . in the ntbmd@xcite results ,",
    "hydrogen was found to be bonded with more than one silicon in most of the clusters but in the present case we find this only for si@xmath2h , si@xmath3h and si@xmath4h clusters .",
    "we find that our structures have lower energies than those of the ntbmd structures .",
    "the nature of bonding has been investigated by performing charge density calculations . in the following",
    "we discuss our results for each cluster .",
    "( a)si@xmath35h : :       the ground state geometry of si@xmath2h cluster is shown in fig",
    "two silicon atoms and hydrogen form a triangular structure .",
    "note that the two silicon atoms are bonded to each other not only via si - si bond but also via si - h - si bridge type bond .",
    "the lowest energy structure of si@xmath2f@xcite and si@xmath2na@xcite are similar to the structure of si@xmath2h . in si@xmath2h cluster ,",
    "si - si bond length is 2.131  and hydrogen is equidistant from both silicon atoms with the bond length of 1.724  which is larger than its value of 1.583  in si - h dimer .",
    "the si - si bond length in si@xmath2h cluster is smaller than the si@xmath2 dimer bond length of 2.184 .",
    "this implies that hydrogen pulls both silicon atoms closer and increases bonding between them .",
    "thus , the additional bonding between silicon atoms is due to the si - h - si bridge bond which is attractive in nature .",
    "such bridge type bonds are thought to be present in a : si - h and play an important role in explaining the staebler - wronski effect@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that hydrogen is bonded with both silicon atoms although its valance is one .",
    "this is seen clearly from the valance charge density plotted in fig .",
    "2 , which shows existence of bonds between hydrogen and the two silicon atoms .",
    "such overcoordination of hydrogen has also been observed recently in sic system@xcite .",
    "we also see from this figure that the electrons are more localized near the hydrogen atom .",
    "this is expected since hydrogen is more electronegative than silicon@xcite .",
    "thus there is a small charge transfer from silicon atoms to hydrogen@xcite . as a result ,",
    "si - h bond is neither purely covalent nor ionic but is polar covalent@xcite .",
    "( b)si@xmath36h : :       the ground state geometry of si@xmath3h is shown in fig .",
    "this is a planar structure with two fold symmetry and has some resemblance with si@xmath5 cluster@xcite .",
    "hydrogen in this cluster is bonded with two silicon atoms ( 1 and 2 ) and is equidistant from both atoms with bond lengths of 1.715 .",
    "silicon atom no.3 is also equidistant from silicon atoms 1 and 2 .",
    "the bond length between silicon atoms 1 and 2 is 2.377  which is more than the si - si bond length in si@xmath2h .",
    "this indicates that bonding between 1 and 2 silicon atoms is weaker than the si - si bond in si@xmath2h because of the presence of another silicon atom . comparing this with si@xmath2h structure",
    ", we note that the additional silicon takes diagonal position opposite to hydrogen .",
    "we see that although hydrogen does not modify the si@xmath3 geometry much , it does modify the bond lengths . particularly , the bond length between silicon atoms 1 and 2 in si@xmath3h is smaller than bond length of 2.613  in si@xmath3 cluster .",
    "thus as in si@xmath2h , hydrogen pulls silicon atoms 1 and 2 closer , which can be attributed to the si - h - si bridge bond .",
    "we note that the lowest energy structure of si@xmath3na@xcite is similar to the present structure , but for si@xmath3f cluster the ground state geometry is different@xcite .",
    "( c)si@xmath37h : :       the ground state geometry of the cluster is shown in fig .",
    "four silicon atoms form a flat rhombus and the hydrogen atom is above the plane and bonded with one of the silicon atoms .",
    "the same structure was shown as the lowest energy geometry of si@xmath5f cluster@xcite .",
    "the lowest energy structure of si@xmath5na@xcite cluster is similar to the present structure but differs in the coordination of na atom .",
    "comparison of this structure with si@xmath5 structure@xcite shows that the addition of hydrogen does not bring much change to si@xmath5 structure .",
    "comparison with si@xmath4 cluster@xcite shows that this structure does not have any resemblance with si@xmath4 cluster .",
    "based on the idea of local softness and hardness , galv@xmath38n _ _ et al__@xcite predicted the sites preferred by hard and soft species in si@xmath5 cluster .",
    "we find that hydrogen goes to the position according to their prediction .",
    "( d)si@xmath39h : :       two lowest energy structures of si@xmath4h are very close in energy and differ only by 0.06 ev . the geometry which is higher in energy",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "three of the silicon atoms , numbered 1 , 4 and 5 form a triangular plane and silicon atom no .",
    "2 is above and no .",
    "3 is below the plane .",
    "hydrogen takes the apex position in the structure and is bonded with only one silicon atom .",
    "the geometry of the silicon atoms is same as in si@xmath4@xcite cluster .",
    "the lowest energy structure of si@xmath40h cluster is shown in fig .",
    "geometry of this cluster is similar to si@xmath28 cluster@xcite except that one of the silicon atoms is replaced by hydrogen .",
    "note that hydrogen in this cluster is attached to two silicon atoms , which is also the case in si@xmath2h and si@xmath3h clusters .",
    "geometrically hydrogen plays the role of silicon in these three clusters , _",
    "i.e. _ the geometry of si@xmath2h is similar to si@xmath3 , si@xmath3h is similar to si@xmath5 and si@xmath4h is similar to si@xmath6 .",
    "we note that a two coordinated silicon atom exists in si@xmath3 , si@xmath5 and si@xmath6 clusters and hydrogen replaces this silicon atom to form si@xmath2h , si@xmath3h and si@xmath4h respectively .",
    "we speculate that this may be a general feature of si@xmath0h clusters , _",
    "i.e. _ , if a two coordinated silicon atoms exists in a si@xmath41 cluster , hydrogen will replace the two coordinated silicon atom to form si@xmath0h cluster , which will have the same geometry as si@xmath41 cluster .",
    "this seems to imply that hydrogen will form si - h - si bridge type bond between two nearby silicon atoms which are doubly coordinated . in the context of _ a_-si : h this would imply that hydrogen will form si - h - si bond between two nearby silicon atoms having two dangling bonds .",
    "comparison with si@xmath4f geometry shows that one of the low energy structures@xcite is similar to si@xmath4h shown in fig .",
    "the low energy geometries for si@xmath40na@xcite cluster are similar to our low energy geometries for si@xmath4h and the lowest energy structure is also the same .",
    "( e)si@xmath42h : :       the ground state geometry of si@xmath6h is shown in fig .",
    "1(f ) . in this structure , four silicon atoms numbered 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 form a distorted plane and the remaining two atoms numbered 4 and 6 are above the plane .",

    "i.e. _ in si@xmath6@xcite cluster one silicon atom is above and another is below the si@xmath5 plane , but in si@xmath6h two silicon atoms are above the plane . comparing with the results of si@xmath6h@xmath18 clusters@xcite",
    ", our geometry of si@xmath6h falls in the class of tetrahedral bonding network .",
    "we find that this is the only cluster among the clusters considered here where the geometry of the silicon atoms differs from the ground state geometry of the host silicon cluster@xcite .",
    "this shows that hydrogen can cause a transition from one geometry to another geometry .",
    "one of the low energy geometries of si@xmath28f@xcite cluster is same as the present structure .",
    "but in the case of si@xmath28na@xcite one of the low energy structures has similar geometry but it differs from our structure by coordination of the na atom .",
    "( f)si@xmath43h : :       the ground state geometry of the structure is shown in fig .",
    "silicon atoms in this structure form a closed and compact unit and the cluster has pentagonal symmetry .",
    "five silicon atoms numbered 1 , 7 , 6 , 4 and 3 make a pentagonal plane and one silicon atom is above and another is below the plane .",
    "silicon atoms which are not in the pentagonal plane are bonded to all the atoms in the pentagonal plane .",
    "hydrogen takes the apex position in the structure and is bonded with one silicon which is out of the pentagonal plane .",
    "it is interesting to note that instead of bonding with four coordinated silicon , hydrogen is bonded with five coordinated silicon . in si@xmath7h , si@xmath8h ,",
    "si@xmath9h and si@xmath10h we found the same trend of hydrogen preferring to bond with an over - coordinated silicon atom .",
    "this is surprising since one would have expected it to bond with less coordinated silicon .",
    "this may be attributed to slightly higher electronegativity of h compared to si and as a result , h prefers to bond with silicon atom having more number of electrons .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier calculation on structural evolution of si@xmath6h@xmath18 clusters@xcite , where it was found that hydrogen is not necessarily bonded with a silicon site having dangling bonds , but with a site where lumo amplitude is larger .",
    "comparison of si@xmath7h with si@xmath7 @xcite , @xcite cluster shows that hydrogen hardly changes the geometry of si@xmath7 cluster implying that si@xmath7 cluster is a very stable cluster .",
    "the lowest energy geometry of si@xmath44f@xcite and one of the low energy structure of si@xmath44na@xcite is similar to our ground state geometry .",
    "( g)si@xmath45h : :       figs .",
    "1(h ) shows the ground state geometry of si@xmath8h .",
    "this structure is also made of a compact , closed unit of silicon atoms with hydrogen sticking to the structure from outside .",
    "we see that si@xmath8h shows some similarity with si@xmath7h cluster _ i.e. _ the same pentagonal plane formed by silicon atoms numbered 4 , 3 , 1 , 7 and 2 exists in si@xmath7h and one silicon is above and another is below the plane(6 and 5 ) as in si@xmath7h .",
    "silicon atom 8 is attached to the triangular plane of the si@xmath7h structure in such a way that it is away from hydrogen atom . as in si@xmath7h hydrogen atom",
    "is attached to the silicon atom which is bonded with five silicon atoms .",
    "1(h ) shows that si@xmath8h has two distorted si@xmath5 planes ; silicon atoms numbered 8 , 4 , 3 and 5 form one distorted si@xmath5 plane and 2 , 6 , 1 and 7 form another .",
    "these planes are not parallel but rotated with respect to each other in such a way as to have more than one bond for each silicon atom with the atoms in the other plane . comparing our ground state geometry of si@xmath8h with si@xmath8@xcite geometry , we see that silicon atoms have similar geometry except that the si@xmath5 planes are distorted in si@xmath8h .",
    "( h)si@xmath46h : :       the ground state geometry of the cluster is shown in fig .",
    "this structure is also compact and closed by silicon atoms .",
    "the structure consists of two si@xmath5 planes formed by atoms 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 and 5 , 8 , 2 , 7 and silicon no.6 forms a cap .",

    "is connected to the five fold coordinated silicon .",
    "comparison with si@xmath10 @xcite cluster shows that hydrogen hardly changes the geometry of si@xmath10 cluster implying that si@xmath10 cluster is a very stable cluster . a general feature of clusters si@xmath6h , si@xmath7h , si@xmath8h , si@xmath9h and si@xmath10h is that silicon atoms in the cluster form a closed compact unit with hydrogen outside this structural unit .",
    "we find that the total energy of si@xmath0 as well as of si@xmath0h clusters increases approximately linearly with the cluster size _",
    "n_. the addition of hydrogen to an si@xmath0 cluster reduces the energy of the cluster by approximately 15 ev . the cohesive energy per particle versus number of silicon atoms",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "as seen clearly from the figure cohesive energy per particle increases rapidly up to si@xmath28h cluster and then it increases slowly as a function of size .",
    "as noted earlier , from this size ( si@xmath28h ) onwards silicon atoms in the cluster form closed compact unit and some of the silicon atoms have coordination number more than four .",
    "we take the first excited electronic level gap of a cluster as the difference between the first excited electronic level and the highest occupied level . for closed - shell or sub - shell systems",
    "this gap will be the same as homo - lumo gap which is related to the chemical hardness and electronic stability of a system@xcite-@xcite . though the first excited electronic level gap is not equivalent to homo - lumo gap for si@xmath0h clusters",
    ", it can be related to electronic stability",
    ". a bigger value of the first excited electronic level gap for a system means that it is difficult to excite electrons from its ground state and thus the electronic system can sustain its ground state for larger perturbations . thus the first excited electronic level gap can be taken as a measure of the electronic stability of a system .",
    "we have shown the first excited level gap as a function of cluster size in fig . 4 for si@xmath0h and si@xmath0 clusters .",
    "also shown in the figure are results of lu et al@xcite for si@xmath0 clusters which are in good agreement with our results .",
    "we see that general trend of variation of first excited electronic level gap is quite similar for si@xmath0h and si@xmath0 clusters .",
    "the figure also shows that the addition of hydrogen can cause large changes in the electronic structure of si@xmath0 cluster .    from fig .",
    "4 we see that the gap fluctuates with size , which indicates that the gap strongly depends on the size and geometry of a cluster .",
    "it might be interesting to draw parallels with short - range potential fluctuations in _",
    "a_-si : h system which occur at the length length scale of 3@xcite .",
    "it can be argued that an amorphous system can be considered as a loosely connected network of small clusters and thus our calculation provoids a first - principle basis for the potential fluctuations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we see that the first excited electronic level gap for si@xmath0h is , on an average , larger than that of si@xmath0 cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the band gap of _",
    "a_:si increases on hydrogenation@xcite .",
    "further , fig .",
    "4 shows that si@xmath2h , si@xmath3h , si@xmath4h , si@xmath7h , si@xmath9h and si@xmath10h clusters are electronically more stable compared to si@xmath5h , si@xmath6h and si@xmath8h clusters .",
    "also we see that si@xmath2 , si@xmath4 , si@xmath6 , si@xmath7 and si@xmath10 clusters are electronically more stable than other silicon clusters(si@xmath3 , si@xmath5 , si@xmath8 and si@xmath9 clusters ) , since they have larger gaps .    to examine geometrical stability we have calculated the difference between the total energy of the modified si@xmath0 cluster , which has the same positions of silicon atoms as in the si@xmath0h cluster , and the ground state geometry of si@xmath0 cluster .",
    "this energy difference is a measure of how much a silicon cluster distorts from its ground state geometry due to the addition of hydrogen atom .",
    "lower value of this difference for a si@xmath0 cluster means that the cluster is geometrically stable .",
    "this total energy difference as a function of cluster size _",
    "n _ is shown in fig .",
    "the figure shows that si@xmath2 , si@xmath5 , si@xmath7 and si@xmath10 clusters are geometrically more stable than si@xmath3 , si@xmath4 , si@xmath6 , si@xmath8 and si@xmath9 clusters . on the other hand si@xmath3 , si@xmath4 , si@xmath6 , si@xmath8 and si@xmath9 clusters",
    "are stabilized by hydrogen and have a greater tendency to adsorb hydrogen .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions drawn by comparing si@xmath0h and si@xmath0 ground state geometries in section * iii * , as si@xmath2 , si@xmath5 , si@xmath7 and si@xmath10 clusters were least distorted by the addition of hydrogen .",
    "thus the above discussion shows that , si@xmath2 , si@xmath7 and si@xmath10 clusters are the most stable clusters from both viewpoints of electronic as well as geometrical stability .    as pointed out earlier in section * iii * , hydrogen is attached to silicon clusters from outside in several cases ( si@xmath5h to si@xmath10h ) . to examine this further ,",
    "we have performed the steepest descent optimization on si@xmath6h and si@xmath7h clusters with hydrogen surrounded by silicon atoms .",
    "we find that hydrogen atom always comes out of the silicon cluster independent of the cluster size .",
    "this is mainly due to the higher electrostatic energy of the cluster when hydrogen is inside the cluster .",
    "thus our result implies that hydrogen will tend to come out of crystalline silicon and would like to stay on the surface .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental observation in which hydrogen is used to produce homogeneous silicon surface by terminating surface silicon dangling bonds to reduce the surface reconstruction@xcite .    to investigate fragmentation products of si@xmath0 and si@xmath0h clusters",
    ", we have calculated the difference between the total energy of a cluster which undergoes fragmentation and that of its possible product clusters .",
    "the most probable pathway for fragmentation of a particular cluster is the one which has the smallest total energy difference@xcite .",
    "since the clusters are small in size , we are assuming that the fragmentation results in only two product clusters .",
    "our calculations are only for neutral fragmentation of si@xmath0 and si@xmath0h clusters .",
    "our lowest energy fragmentation products of si@xmath0 clusters agree very well with all primary fragmentation products calculated by shvartsburg _ _ et al__@xcite . in table .",
    "1 we have given the lowest energy fragmentation products of si@xmath0h clusters with the corresponding dissociation energies .",
    "we see from the table that the lowest energy fragmentation products have hydrogen atom as one of the products for all si@xmath0h clusters except for si@xmath8h cluster .",
    "this shows that it is easy to remove hydrogen from si@xmath0h clusters .",
    "we have presented detailed results for the ground state structures and electronic properties of si@xmath0h clusters using the car - parrinello molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we find that hydrogen can form a bridge like si - h - si bond connecting two silicon atoms .",
    "such bridge like bonds are thought to be present in _ a_-si : h@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , among the clusters considered here hydrogen forms a bridge like bond only in si@xmath2h , si@xmath3h and si@xmath4h clusters ; in others it is bonded with only one silicon atom and attached to the cluster from outside .",
    "charge density calculations show that the si - h bond in all clusters is polar covalent . in clusters from si@xmath7h to si@xmath10h ,",
    "silicon atoms form a compact unit and hydrogen attaches to a silicon atom which is over - coordinated .",
    "though hydrogen has small effect on the geometry of the host silicon cluster , it changes bond lengths and tries to distort the silicon cluster .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of hydrogen in _",
    "a_-si : h where it has been found that hydrogen creates local distortions as it moves@xcite , @xcite .",
    "we find that hydrogen has a tendency to come out of compact silicon clusters and prefers to stay out of the cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of hydrogen on silicon surfaces@xcite .",
    "the first excitation electronic level gap of the si@xmath0h clusters fluctuates as a function of size and this may provide a first principles basis for the short range potential fluctuations in _",
    "a_-si : h@xcite-@xcite .",
    "our calculations show that the addition of hydrogen can cause large changes in the electronic structure of host si@xmath0 cluster .",
    "furthermore , it shows that si@xmath2h , si@xmath3h , si@xmath4h , si@xmath7h , si@xmath9h and si@xmath10h clusters are electronically more stable than si@xmath5h , si@xmath6h and si@xmath8h clusters .",
    "we find that si@xmath2 , si@xmath5 , si@xmath7 and si@xmath10 clusters are geometrically more stable than si@xmath3 , si@xmath4 , si@xmath6 , si@xmath8 and si@xmath9 clusters , while si@xmath2 , si@xmath4 , si@xmath6 , si@xmath7 and si@xmath10 clusters are electronically more stable than si@xmath3 , si@xmath5 , si@xmath8 and si@xmath9 clusters .",
    "we have calculated the lowest energy fragmentation products of si@xmath0 and si@xmath0h clusters .",
    "our results for fragmentation products of si@xmath0 clusters agree very well with the earlier predictions .",
    "the lowest energy fragmentation products of si@xmath0h clusters show that it is easy to remove hydrogen from silicon clusters .",
    "comparison of si@xmath2h to si@xmath7h cluster with the corresponding f and na substituted clusters shows that almost all have similar low energy geometries implying that the geometrical effect of h , f and na on si@xmath0clusters are similar .",
