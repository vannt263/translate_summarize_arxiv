    "it is a well - known fact of physical chemistry that solvophobic solutes of similar sizes and shapes tend to attract each other in an incompatible solvent .",
    "classic examples are the effective attraction between monomers of polymer coils in poor solvent , which leads to collapse below the @xmath0-temperature,@xcite or the attraction between hydrophobic surfaces in water.@xcite the effective attraction ultimately leads to phase separation of the solvent and solute as the concentration of the latter increases . the solvent - averaged effective interaction ( or potential of mean force )",
    "is related to the variation of free energy upon bringing the two solutes from infinite to a finite separation in the solvent .",
    "the change in free energy has an entropic component , associated with the reorganization of the solvent molecules around the two solutes , and an energetic contribution which accounts for the deficit in attractive interactions between solvent molecules close to the solutes .",
    "there is some analogy between solvophobic attraction and the well - known depletion interaction between colloidal particles induced by a depletant like non - adsorbing polymers.@xcite in the latter case the depletion attraction can be essentially understood in terms of excluded volume , and is hence of entropic origin , while hydrophobic interactions have a large energetic contribution , associated with the formation or break up of hydrogen bonds .",
    "it has been recognized that the size of the solute plays an important role in understanding its solvation energy , and effective solute - solute attraction.@xcite for solutes of a characteristic size larger than a few molecular diameters ( typically larger than 1 nm ) , a mechanism first envisioned by stilinger @xcite is that of solvent dewetting ( `` drying '' ) , i.e. the solvent molecules tend to move away from the surface of a large solute , and form a liquid - gas like interface parallel to the solute interface.@xcite the overlap of the drying zones associated with two large solutes as their surfaces come together may then give rise to an effective attraction,@xcite very much like the depletion mechanism between - colloidal particles .",
    "the mechanism holds , a priori , for any solvent , provided that it is in a thermodynamic state close to liquid - vapor coexistence.@xcite the drying mechanism and resulting attraction between two plate - like solutes was confirmed by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of wallquist and berne.@xcite similar simulations were carried out for two large spherical solutes in a lennard - jones solvent , and attractive solvation force profiles were determined.@xcite    however most nano - scale biomolecular solutes , like proteins , carry electric charges , which make them , at least partly , hydrophilic .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to investigate the influence of solute - solute and solute - solvent electrostatic interactions on the effective , solvent - induced potential of mean force between two solutes . in order to make contact with earlier work on neutral hard - sphere solutes , we restrict the present investigation to spherical solutes of identical radii @xmath1 nm , but carrying various surface charge patterns .",
    "the two main questions which will be addressed are : a ) how does the competition between hydrophobicity and electrostatics affect the total effective force between anionic and cationic solutes ; b ) is the total force sensitive to details of the charge patterns carried by the solutes ?",
    "in particular are there significant differences between results obtained with continuous and discrete charge patterns of the solutes ? such differences were recently highlighted by a calculation of the second virial coefficient in an implicit solvent model of globular proteins , which does not , of course , allow for hydrophobic attraction.@xcite    we have attempted to answer these questions by a series of constant pressure md simulations of two spherical solutes of varying radii ( up to @xmath2 nm ) immersed in water modeled by the spc / e intermolecular potential,@xcite taken under normal conditions , i.e. close to liquid - vapor coexistence .",
