    "the study of flavor changing decays of the @xmath5-quark is always an active field in the heavy flavor physics , and the most obvious reason lies on that those processes can provide useful information on the various charm related cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix elements which are the main ingredients of the standard model(sm ) .",
    "furthermore , the thorough understanding of the sm in itself needs a comprehension of the flavor changing dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , such a comprehension is difficult contemporarily , the fact is that form factors characterizing those processes are not perturbative quantities and whose determination must invoke some non - perturbative method . this paper aims to give a preliminary determination of the form factors of semileptonic @xmath0 decay . in the calculation",
    "we will use the method of qcd sum rules on the light - cone @xcite , which in the past has been successfully applied to various problems in heavy meson physics , see @xcite for a review .",
    "the method of light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) is a new development of the standard technique of qcd sum rules  la svz sum rules @xcite , which comes as the remedy for the conventional approach in which vacuum condensates carry no momentum @xcite .",
    "the main difference between svz sum rule and lcsr is that the short - distance wilson ope in increasing dimension is replaced by the light - cone expansion in terms of distribution amplitudes of increasing twist , originally used in the description of the hard exclusive process @xcite . in recent years",
    "there have been many applications of lcsr to baryons .",
    "the nucleon electromagnetic form factors were studied for the first time in @xcite and , more recently , in @xcite for a further consideration .",
    "several nucleon related processes gave fruitful results within lcsr , the weak decay @xmath6 was considered in @xcite in both full qcd and hqet lcsr .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath7 transition form factor was worked out in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will adopt the lcsr approach to study the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath0 .",
    "this transition had been studied in the literature by several authors , employing flavor symmetry or quark model or both in refs .",
    "@xcite . there are also qcd sum rule description of the form factors @xcite , upon which the total decay rate are obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the relevant @xmath1 baryon das are first discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] . following that sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] is devoted to the lcsrs for the semileptonic @xmath0 decay form factors . the numerical analysis and our conclusion",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "our discussion in this section for the @xmath1 baryon das parallels with that for the nucleon @xcite , so we only list the results following from that procedure and for details it is recommended to consult the original paper .",
    "the @xmath1 baryon das are defined through the matrix element @xmath8 where the @xmath1 generically designates the spinor for the @xmath1 baryon with momentum @xmath9 .",
    "only axial - vector das are presented here , for those with other lorentz structures do not contribute in the final sum rules .",

    "complying with the standard philosophy in the sum rule analysis , we consider the following correlation function @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the current interpolating the @xmath33 baryon state , @xmath34 is the weak current , @xmath35 is the charge conjugation matrix , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 denote the color indices .",
    "the auxiliary light - cone vector @xmath39 is introduced to project out the main contribution on the light - cone .",
    "the interpolating current used here is not the unique one , as exemplified in case studies @xcite for the applications of qcd sum rules , and there can be other choices .",
    "the coupling constant of the interpolating current to the vacuum can thus be defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the @xmath33 baryon spinor and four - momentum , respectively .",

    "we start with analysis of the twist-3 sum rules , in which only twist-3 da is kept .",
    "substitute the above given parameters into the lcsrs and vary the continuum threshold within the range @xmath98 , we find there exist an acceptable stability in the range @xmath99 for the borel parameter .",
    "the @xmath100 and the @xmath51 dependence for the          respectively . also given in fig",
    ". 2 are two leading twist results , corresponding to only retain @xmath64 in the sum rules .",
    "it is apparent that in that approximation , only @xmath67 and @xmath65 survive .",
    "apart from the leading twist da we discuss in ( [ da - a ] ) , there still exists another form from chernyak , ogloblin and zhitnitsky@xcite : @xmath101 , \\label{coz}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the asymptotic da .",
    "the corresponding result is also illustrated for contrast .    for the up to twist-6 sum rules , the stability is agreeable within the range @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in that working region ,",
    "the twist-3 contribution to @xmath67 is the dominant one , amounting to over @xmath105 .",
    "however , the case is different for @xmath65 : the main contribution comes from the twist-4 das and its magnitude is approximately @xmath106 of the twist-3 one in the whole dynamical region , but with a different sign . on account of the relatively small momentum transfer , the asymptotic behavior of das may not be fulfilled and we need incorporate higher conformal spin in the expansion for them . furthermore , qcd sum rule tends to overestimate the higher conformal spin expansion parameters @xcite , and the corresponding parameter will enter in the coefficients of the higher conformal spin expansion , which is well known as the wandzura - wilczek type contribution .",
    "so at the current stage , the strategy to stay with twist-3 sum rules seems to be a good choice .",
    "the @xmath100 and the @xmath51 dependence for the corresponding form factors are also shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 .    both the form factors in the whole kinematical region , @xmath107 , can be fitted well by the dipole formula @xmath108 and the uncertainties are negligible .",
    "below in table [ di - fit ] we give those coefficients for two sets of parameters : @xmath109 , @xmath110 for the twist-3 sum rule and @xmath111 , @xmath112 for the up to twist-6 one .",

    "the differential decay rate is shown in fig .",
    "3 . if only the twist-3 amplitude @xmath25 is retained , we have for the total decay width @xmath3 , which agrees well with the data given by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "this result is also in agreement with the qcd sum rule predictions made in @xcite . as for the decay asymmetry",
    "parameter @xmath2 defined in @xcite , we obtain @xmath130 , which corresponds to the ratio at zero momentum transfer @xmath131 .",
    "that value lies very close to the recent experimental data from cleo @xcite .",
    "note that the errors quoted above reflect the uncertainty due to the borel parameter @xmath132 and the continuum @xmath133 .",
    "the uncertainty due to the variation of the other qcd parameters is not included , which may reach @xmath134 or more .      for a comparison , the total decay width computed from the up to twist-6 form factors",
    "is @xmath135 , whose agreement with the experimental value is good , too .",
    "however , for the asymmetry parameter @xmath2 , we get @xmath136 , which lies above the particle data group s average @xcite and still greater than the latest experimental measurement @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the two form factors at zero momentum transfer of that asymmetry is @xmath137 .",
    "this phenomenon , i.e. , the twist-3 result agrees better with the experiments , may be attributed to our incomplete inclusion of the higher conformal spin components in the expansion for the das .    to summarize , we have given a preliminary investigation on the semileptonic decay @xmath138 using the lcsr method .",
    "sum rules for the form factors are derived and used to calculate the decay width and the asymmetry parameter .",
    "the decay width agrees well with the experimental data both for the twist-3 and the up to twist-6 sum rules , while the asymmetry s agreement is not so good : the twist-3 da alone can account for the experimental value but the result including higher twist contributions is not so good .",
    "this is partly due to the interplay of our incomplete inclusion of the higher conformal spin contributions and the qcd sum rule over - estimated value for @xmath28 .",
