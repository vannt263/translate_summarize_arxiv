    "_ chromatic number _ of @xmath9 , denoted @xmath10 , is the least number of colors needed in a proper coloring of @xmath9 ( a coloring such that any two adjacent vertices have distinct colors ) .",
    "when talking about a proper coloring of a family @xmath3 of subsets of a given set , we implicitly refer to a proper coloring of the intersection graph of @xmath3 , thus the chromatic number @xmath1 is defined in a natural way .",
    "the chromatic number of families of geometric objects in the plane have been extensively studied since the sixties @xcite .",
    "since it is possible to construct sets of pairwise intersecting ( straight - line ) segments of any size , the chromatic number of sets of segments in the plane is unbounded in general .",
    "however , erds conjectured that triangle - free intersection graphs of segments in the plane have bounded chromatic number ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this was recently disproved  @xcite .",
    "the conjecture of erds initiated the study of the chromatic number of families of geometric objects in the plane as a function of their _ clique number _ , the maximum size of subsets of the family that pairwise intersect  @xcite . in this paper , we consider families of geometric objects in the plane for which the chromatic number only depends on local properties of the families , such as the maximum number of objects containing a given point of the plane .",
    "consider a set @xmath11 of pseudo - disks ( subsets of the plane which are homeomorphic to a closed disk ) such that the intersection of the interiors of any two pseudo - disks is empty .",
    "let @xmath12 be the planar hypergraph with vertex set @xmath3 , in which the hyperedges are the maximal sets of pseudo - disks whose intersection is non - empty .",
    "a proper coloring of @xmath3 is equivalent to a coloring of @xmath12 in which all the vertices of each hyperedge have distinct colors .",
    "if every point is contained in at most @xmath4 pseudo - disks , borodin conjectured that there exists such a coloring of @xmath12 with at most @xmath13 colors  @xcite .",
    "it was recently proven that this conjecture holds asymptotically  @xcite ( not only in the plane , but also on any fixed surface ) . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath3 can be properly colored with @xmath14 colors .",
    "it seems natural to investigate the same problem when pseudo - disks are replaced by _ pseudo - segments_. these are continuous injective functions from @xmath15 $ ] to @xmath16 and are usually referred to as _ strings_. consider a set @xmath17 of such strings .",
    "we say that @xmath18 is _ touching _ if no pair of strings of @xmath18 cross , and that it is _ @xmath4-touching _ if furthermore at most @xmath4 strings can `` touch '' in any point of the plane , i.e. , any point of the plane is contained in at most @xmath4 strings ( see figure  [ fig : strings ] for an example ) .",
    "note that the family of all touching sets of strings contains all _ contact systems of strings _ , defined as sets of strings such that the interior of any two strings have empty intersection .",
    "in other words , if @xmath19 is a contact point in the interior of a string @xmath20 , all the strings containing @xmath19 distinct from @xmath20 end at @xmath19 . in  @xcite , hlinn studied contact system of strings such that all the strings ending at @xmath19 leave from the same side of @xmath20 .",
    "such a representation is said to be _ one - sided _",
    "( see figure  [ fig : contact ] for an example ) .",
    "it was proved in  @xcite that if a contact system of strings is @xmath4-touching and every contact point is one - sided , then the strings can be colored with @xmath21 colors .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to study @xmath4-touching sets of strings in their full generality . observe that if @xmath18 is @xmath4-touching , @xmath4 might be much smaller than the maximum degree of @xmath18 .",
    "however , based on the cases of pseudo - disks and contact system of strings , we conjectured the following in the conference version of this paper  @xcite :    [ conj : multi ] for some constant @xmath22 , any @xmath4-touching set of strings can be colored with @xmath23 colors .",
    "this conjecture was subsequently proved by fox and pach  @xcite , who showed that any @xmath4-touching set of strings can be colored with @xmath24 colors ( where @xmath25 is the base of the natural logarithm ) . in section  [ sec : general ] , we show how to slightly improve their bound for small values of @xmath4 .",
    "we also show that for any odd @xmath4 , the clique on @xmath26 vertices can be represented as a set of @xmath4-touching strings , so the best possible constant @xmath19 in conjecture  [ conj : multi ] is between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    in section  [ sec : intersect ] , we give improved bounds when any two strings can intersect a bounded number of times . in section  [ sec : contact ] , we restrict ourselves to contact systems of strings where any two strings intersect at most once ( called @xmath29-intersecting , which were previouly studied by hlinn  @xcite .",
    "he asked whether there is a constant @xmath19 such that every one - sided @xmath29-intersecting @xmath4-touching contact system of strings is @xmath30-colorable .",
    "we prove that they are @xmath31-colorable , and that every @xmath4-touching contact system of segments is @xmath32-colorable .",
    "note that we do not need our contact systems to be one - sided ( but adding this assumption offers a minor improvement on the additive constants ) .    before giving general bounds ,",
    "let us first mention two classical families of touching strings for which coloring problems are well understood .",
    "if a @xmath4-touching set of strings has the property that the interior of each string is disjoint from all the other strings , then each string can be thought of as an edge of some ( planar ) graph with maximum degree @xmath4 . by a classical theorem of shannon , the strings",
    "can then be colored with @xmath33 colors .",
    "if moreover , any two strings intersect at most once , then they can be colored with @xmath34 colors by a theorem of vizing ( even with @xmath4 colors whenever @xmath35 , using a more recent result of sanders and zhao  @xcite ) . in this sense , all the problems considered in this article can be seen as a extension of edge - coloring of planar graphs .",
    "an _ @xmath36-monotone string _ is a string such that every vertical line intersects it in at most one point .",
    "alternatively , it can be defined as the curve of a continuous function from an interval of @xmath37 to @xmath37 .",
    "sets of @xmath4-touching @xmath36-monotone strings are closely related to bar @xmath4-visibility graphs .",
    "bar @xmath4-visibility graph _ is a graph whose vertex - set consists of horizontal segments in the plane ( bars ) , and two vertices are adjacent if _ and only if _ there is a vertical segment connecting the two corresponding bars , and intersecting no more than @xmath4 other bars .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the graph of any set of @xmath4-touching @xmath36-monotone strings is a spanning subgraph of some bar @xmath38-visibility graph , while any bar @xmath38-visibility graph can be represented as a set of @xmath4-touching @xmath36-monotone strings . using this correspondence",
    ", it directly follows from  @xcite that @xmath4-touching @xmath36-monotone strings are @xmath39 colorable , and that the clique on @xmath40 vertices can be represented as a set of @xmath4-touching @xmath36-monotone strings .",
    "if the left - most point of each @xmath36-monotone string intersects the vertical line @xmath41 , then it directly follows from  @xcite that the strings can be colored with @xmath42 colors ( and a clique on @xmath42 vertices can be represented by @xmath4-touching @xmath36-monotone strings in this specific way ) .",
    "before proving any result on the structure of sets of @xmath4-touching strings in general , we make the following observation :    [ obs : pla ] the family of intersection graphs of 2-touching strings is exactly the class of planar graphs .    the class of planar graphs being exactly the class of intersection graphs of 2-touching pseudo - disks ( see @xcite ) it is clear that planar graphs are intersection graphs of 2-touching strings ( by taking a connected subset of the boundaries of each pseudo - disk ) .",
    "furthermore , every intersection graph of 2-touching strings is contained in the intersection graph of 2-touching pseudo - disks , and is thus planar .",
    "indeed , it is easy given a set of 2-touching strings @xmath17 to draw a set of 2-touching pseudo - disks @xmath11 such that @xmath43 for every @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the following result was proved by fox and pach  @xcite ( this shows conjecture  [ conj : multi ] ) . in the following , @xmath25 is the base of the natural logarithm .",
    "[ th : fox ] any @xmath4-touching set of strings is @xmath45-colorable .",
    "their theorem is a direct consequence on the following bound on the number of edges in a graph represented by a set of @xmath4-touching strings . their proof is inspired by the probabilistic proof of the crossing lemma .    [ lem : fox ] any graph represented by a set of @xmath46 @xmath4-touching strings has less than @xmath47 edges .    when @xmath48 , their proof can easily be optimized to show that the number of edges is less than @xmath49 .",
    "hence , every such graph has a vertex with degree less than 24 .",
    "these graphs are thus 23-degenerate and have chromatic number at most 24 .",
    "we now show how to modify their proof to slightly improve this bound .",
    "[ th : k3 ] any 3-touching set of strings is 19-colorable .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : k3 ] any graph represented by a set of @xmath46 3-touching strings has at most @xmath50 edges .    our proof follows the same lines as that of lemma  [ lem : fox ] in  @xcite .",

    "we can assume that for any point @xmath52 contained in three different strings , one of the strings is `` sandwiched '' between the other two ( see figure  [ fig : transform ] , left ) .",
    "for otherwise , we can apply the local transformation described in figure  [ fig : sandwich ] and turn @xmath52 into three different points , each containing exactly two strings , without changing @xmath9 .    ]",
    "we now define two spanning subgraphs @xmath53 and @xmath54 of @xmath9 as follows .",
    "two strings @xmath55 and @xmath19 are adjacent in @xmath53 if they intersect and for every intersection point @xmath52 of @xmath55 and @xmath19 , there exists a third string @xmath56 that is sandwiched between @xmath55 and @xmath19 . for every pair of strings @xmath55 and @xmath19 adjacent in @xmath53 , let @xmath57 be an arbitrarily chosen intersection point between @xmath55 and @xmath19 ( with some third string sandwiched between @xmath55 and @xmath19 ) .",

    "if we modify the set of strings intersecting @xmath19 so as to only preserve those 2-touching points ( all the other pairs of strings are made disjoint ) , we obtain a planar graph with vertex - set @xmath67 and with @xmath68 edges .",

    "again , we take @xmath46 minimal , and with respect to this , @xmath51 maximal .",
    "as before , we can assume that @xmath148 is connected and that the two ends of each segment are contact points .",
    "we again consider the plane graph @xmath158 whose vertices are the contact points of @xmath18 , whose edges link two contact points if and only if they are consecutive on a segment of @xmath18 , and whose faces are the connected regions of @xmath159 .",

    "recall that any face @xmath166 of @xmath112 contains at least @xmath169 vertices ( where @xmath232 , defined in the proof of lemma  [ lem : contact ] , is the number of flat contact points `` incident '' to @xmath166 ) , thus at least @xmath170 edges can be added to @xmath112 ( inside @xmath166 ) with the property that @xmath112 remains planar .",
    "we now show that , moreover , the vertices corresponding to the peaks of @xmath18 all lie on the outerface of @xmath158 .",
    "this directly implies that we can add @xmath233 edges to @xmath112 , while keeping @xmath112 planar ( as a consequence , @xmath158 has at most @xmath234 edges ) .    indeed ,",

    "@xmath75 is extendible , so let @xmath237 be an arrangement of pseudo - lines extending @xmath75 ( i.e. such that every segment of @xmath75 is contained in a different pseudo - line of @xmath237 ) .",

    "note that the @xmath256-degeneracy may not be tight for every @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , we only know graphs that are not @xmath257-degenerate for @xmath258 . those graphs are obtained in the following way for @xmath259 : first consider the segments in a straight - line drawing of a planar triangulation with minimum degree 5 and maximum degree 6 , such that any degree five vertices is at distance at least two from the outerface , and such that any pair of degree five vertices are at distance at least three appart .",
    "now let @xmath260 be the segments whose ends respectively touch a 5- and a 6-contact points .",
    "those are the only segments that touch less than 10 other segments ( they only touch 9 of them ) . to make each of them touch one more segment , prolong successively the segments @xmath156 , @xmath155 and so on , by their end that is at the 6-contact point , until reaching another segment .",
