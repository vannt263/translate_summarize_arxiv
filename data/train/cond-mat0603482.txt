    "it is not clear when the mantra `` room temperature superconductivity '' first passed the lips of superconductivity researchers , but it has attained some prominence in the literature since little used it in the title ( `` superconductivity at room temperature '' ) of an overview in 1965@xcite of his electronic polarization mechanism proposed for polymeric systems .",
    "ginzburg immediately transitioned this to two - dimensional metal - insulator sandwich materials and generalized the description.@xcite sad to say , these electronic - mediated superconductors are yet to be realized .",
    "uses of the term _ room temperature superconductivity _ have ranged from general speculations@xcite to glimpses of `` glitchite''@xcite to editorial coverage of public announcements@xcite to preplanning for applications.@xcite in the ensuing decades vitaly ginzburg has been the most visible and persistent advocate that there is no theoretical justification for pessimism .",
    "ginzburg was elaborating more generally on `` high temperature superconductivity '' by@xcite 1967 and his optimism has never flagged .",
    "hts ( cuprate high temperature superconductors ) set the standard with t@xmath0 90 k in 1987 and rising to @xmath1130 k by the mid-1990s , but there have been no further increases . since there is no viable theory of the mechanism of hts , there is no approach that will allow the rational design of new materials with higher @xmath2 in that class .",
    "the phonon mechanism however has an accurate microscopic theory that is valid to reasonably strong coupling , and therefore invites the design of materials with higher t@xmath3 .",
    "the recent and very surprising breakthroughs in phonon - mediated superconductivity can be put to use to provide a plausible recipe for the design of a room temperature superconductor .",
    "this is the purpose of this modest proposal , where a central feature is the emphasis on _ control _ of the coupling , versus the standard approach of increasing the _ brute strength _ of the coupling .",
    "nearing the end of the 1970s there was pessimism about raising the superconducting transition temperature ( t@xmath3 ) significantly , and there were claims ( mostly unpublished ) that the maximum t@xmath3 was around 30 k. the only superconductivity known at the time ( excluding the superfluidity of @xmath4he which was unlike anything seen in metals ) was symmetric ( @xmath5-wave ) pairing mediated by vibrations of the atoms ( phonons ) .",
    "the maximum t@xmath3 known at the time was 23 k in the a15 system .",
    "the maximum t@xmath3 had increased by only 6 k in 25 years , and it was not due to increase for several more years ( 1986 , when hts was announced ) .",
    "the discovery@xcite in 2001 of mgb@xmath6 , with t@xmath3=40 k , was stunning not only because of the unimaginably high t@xmath3 for phonon - mediated superconductivity , but also because it appeared in a completely wrong kind of material according to the accumulated knowledge .",
    "this aspect has been dealt with in some detail@xcite now , and the pairing mechanism , character , and strength is well understood . while there has been some effort to apply what has been learned from mgb@xmath6 to find other similar , or even better , superconductors ,",
    "so far mgb@xmath6 remains in a class by itself .",
    "diamond , when it is heavily doped with b , becomes superconducting@xcite with reports as high as 12 k. b - doped diamond has features in common@xcite with mgb@xmath6 except for the two - dimensionality ( 2d ) of mgb@xmath6 s electronic structure .",
    "it is this 2d character we deal with here , one important aspect of which has not been emphasized previously .",
    "we confine our consideration to ambient pressure ; applied pressure could well provide enhancements .",
    "migdal - eliashberg ( me ) theory of superconductivity is firmly grounded on the material - specific level@xcite and is one of the impressive successes of condensed matter theory . stripped to its basics , ( phonon - coupled )",
    "t@xmath3 depends on the characteristic frequency @xmath7 of the phonons and on the strength of coupling @xmath8 ; in the strong coupling regime of interest here the retarded coulomb interaction loses relevance .",
    "the essence of increasing t@xmath3 lies in making one or both of these characteristic constants larger while avoiding structural instability .",
    "the focus here is on the decomposition@xcite of @xmath8 @xmath9 where the mode-@xmath8 for momentum @xmath10 is given for circular fermi surfaces in two dimensions by @xmath11^{-2 }       \\sum_k \\delta(\\varepsilon_k)\\delta(\\varepsilon_{k+q } )         = \\frac{1}{\\eta_q\\sqrt{1-\\eta_q^2 } }    \\label{xiq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 .",
    "here @xmath13 is the fermi level ( e@xmath14=0 ) density of states , @xmath15 is the squared electron - displaced ion matrix element averaged over the fermi surface , @xmath16 is the atomic mass , and @xmath17 is the characteristic physical phonon frequency .",
    "the el - ph matrix element @xmath18 involves @xmath19 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 in the standard way . here the band degeneracy @xmath20 factor ( number of fermi surfaces ) is treated as in mgb@xmath6 , where the two @xmath21 surfaces are equally important .    in the conventional adiabatic approximation ,",
    "phonon renormalization is given by the real part of the phonon self - energy at zero frequency @xmath22 ,                  \\eta_q > 1 .",

    "it is the last result eq .",
    "[ chiq ] that we emphasize here : the phonon renormalization is constant ( _ i.e. _ controlled ) for @xmath24 , and diminishes quickly for larger @xmath10 . for circular fermi surfaces there is no sharp peak in @xmath25 at @xmath26 nor anywhere else . in mgb@xmath6 ,",
    "phonon coupling arises dominantly from @xmath24 , and only the two bond - stretching branches have the very large matrix elements .",
    "the number of phonon scattering processes from / to the fermi surface is quantified by the `` nesting function '' @xmath27 ( given here in normalized form whose zone sum is unity ) . for the 2d circular dispersion relation ,",
    "it is the simple known quantity in eq .",
    "it has simple integrable divergences at @xmath10=0 and @xmath28 which , most importantly , do not result in @xmath10-dependent softening , hence avoiding instability in spite of contributing positively to @xmath8 .",
    "this behavior can be contrasted with the vast uncertainty inherent in a general fermi surface , which has arisen forcefully in recent discoveries . under pressure",
    "elemental li metal becomes superconducting up to near 20 k as shown by three groups,@xcite in spite of being an @xmath29 metal with a simple fermi surface.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ xiq3d ] @xmath30 is displayed in three planes@xcite in the zone , where extremely sharp structure is apparent .",
    "the sharp structure near the k symmetry point leads to a lattice instability ( large contribution to @xmath31 ) .",
    "the sharp structure occurs in spite of a very simple cu - like fermi surface consisting of spheres joined by necks along @xmath32 directions .",
    "this example demonstrates why _ control _ of the @xmath10-dependence of the coupling is essential ; @xmath8 is not so large@xcite for li at this volume ( @xmath33 ) yet the lattice has been pushed to instability .",
    "this example shows that the overall value of @xmath8 is not the indicator of instability of the system , which occurs when some phonon frequency is renormalized ( softened ) to zero .",
    "the crucial features to be learned from mgb@xmath6 and li under pressure follow .",
    "high frequency is important ; this has long been understood . by beginning from a very stiff unrenormalized lattice ,",
    "a crystal can withstand a great deal of renormalization to lower frequencies that must accompany strong coupling .",
    "+ 2 . very high",
    "mode @xmath34 s ( up to 20 - 25 for mgb@xmath6 ) can arise without instability .",
    "mgb@xmath6 appears not to be near any instability , although analysis shows@xcite that only @xmath115 - 20% stronger coupling would result in instability .",
    "the phonon softening in 2d systems due to strong coupling , and the total @xmath8 , is independent of carrier concentration ( or varies smoothly if the effective mass changes with doping ) .",
    "impressive results can be attained from strong coupling to only a fraction of the modes . for mgb@xmath6 , t@xmath3 = 40 k with",
    "only 3% of the modes strongly coupled .",
    "these modes are the bond - stretch modes ( 2 out of 9 branches ) with @xmath24 ( 12% of the zone ) .",
    "general - shaped fermi surfaces , even the simple one of li , can readily lead to lattice instability from a thin surface of soft modes in q - space .",
    "such instability restricts the achievement of high t@xmath3 .",
    "two - dimensional parabolic bands provide _ ideal control _ of the q - dependence of coupling strength : phonon renormalization is _ constant _ for @xmath24 , not sharply peaking in an unexpected region of the zone as can happen for a fermi surface of general shape ( viz .",
    "for li in fig .",
    "[ xiq3d ] ) .",
    "the superconducting t@xmath3 of mgb@xmath6 is remarkable , and arises from the extreme strong coupling of 3% of its phonons .",
    "the electron - phonon deformation potential @xmath35 is very large for the bond - stretch modes , and mgb@xmath6 gains a factor @xmath36=4 from having two fermi surfaces .",
    "figure [ hex1 ] illustrates ( 1 ) the @xmath21-band fermi surfaces , idealized to identical circular surfaces , and ( 2 ) the kohn - anomaly region of renormalized phonons @xmath24 . in mgb@xmath6",
    "this `` kohn surface '' encloses only 12% of the zone .",
    "previous analysis@xcite has shown that pushing these phonons further , by either increasing the bare coupling strength @xmath37 or varying the lattice stiffness ( bare phonon frequency ) separately , could increase t@xmath3 by perhaps 20% but then would drive the material to a lattice instability .",
    "it is fairly obvious that if one increases both proportionately , then one gains by enhancing the characteristic frequency while keeping @xmath8 constant .",
    "this is the _ metallic hydrogen _",
    "scenario that was discussed originally 40 years ago.@xcite      there is however the equally obvious approach : introduce more phonons into the coupling . from this viewpoint ,",
    "mgb@xmath6 with its 3% of useful phonons seems pathetic , yet as noted in sec .",
    "iii , increasing the number of strongly coupled phonons be increasing the doping does not enhance @xmath8 because the individual mode @xmath34 s decrease accordingly . and further increasing the matrix elements , which increases @xmath8 , also readily leads to instability .",
    "the key to increasing @xmath8 is not in doing more ( more carriers , hence more phonons ) , but in doing it _",
    "again _ and _ again _ , with other fermi surfaces and other phonons . here the _",
    ", not over the strength of the coupling but over the _ specific momenta _ [ that is , @xmath34 , or more specifically @xmath25 ] becomes essential .",
    "the requirement is to renormalize frequencies in other parts of the zone _ without further softening _ the ones that are already very strongly renormalized , since that will not lead to lattice instability .",
    "two - dimensional circularly - symmetric dispersion relations provide that control , as demonstrated by the equations above .",
    "adding an additional circular fermi surface centered at @xmath39 gives another region of renormalized phonons , and contributions @xmath34 to @xmath8 , of radius @xmath26 centered at @xmath39 .",
    "let us skip directly to the optimal case , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hex19 ] . by adding to the mgb@xmath6 zone - centered surface another spherical fermi surface half - way along the @xmath40-k line , with radius 1/8 of the length of the @xmath40-k line , one obtains three new spanning vectors @xmath41 and their symmetry partners that produces an array of close - packed kohn surfaces of radius @xmath26 within which coupling is strong .",
    "given the close - packing fraction in 2d , @xmath42=0.907 , this arrangement manages to utilize 90% of the zone for strongly coupled phonons , an increase in fraction of zone used , compared to mgb@xmath6 ( 12% ) , by a factor of 7.5 .    this extension from mgb@xmath6",
    "is not yet optimum , because mgb@xmath6 uses only 2/9 of its branches .",
    "optimally , every branch would be drafted into service in strong coupling , giving another factor of 4.5 , or a total enhancement of @xmath130 - 35 .",
    "the strongly coupled modes in mgb@xmath6 have mode-@xmath34 s of mean value 20 - 25 ( calculations so far have not been precise enough to pin this down ) .",
    "let us not be pessimistic , and therefore use @xmath43=25 ; this value is consistent with the value of @xmath8 from the strongly coupled modes divided by 3% , i.e. 0.7/0.03@xmath123 . then with 90% participation of the phonons @xmath8=25@xmath44=22.5 . using the allen - dynes equation@xcite to account properly for the strong - coupling limit that is being approached , and using the mgb@xmath6 frequency of 60 mev",
    ", one obtains t@xmath3=430 k. the strong coupling limit@xcite of the ratio @xmath45 is 13 , so we can estimate the gap of such a superconductor to be @xmath46 ev .",
    "this will be an interesting superconductor indeed .      whereas the architectural design of a room temperature superconductor provided here",
    "is straightforward , the structural engineering necessary to implement this vision will require creativity and knowledge of materials . where does one look ?",
    "figure [ hex19 ] gives an idea of a set of fermi surfaces that could be promising .",
    "this pattern is very much like that of na@xmath47coo@xmath6 , although its t@xmath3=4.5 k , and even that not necessarily from phonons , is not a good example of strong coupling enhanced by fermi surface arrangement .",
    "( the zone - centered fermi surface in na@xmath47coo@xmath6 is much larger than the others . )",
    "the encouraging feature to be emphasized here is that this example shows that the desirable arrangement of figure [ hex19 ] is nothing unusual .",
    "not only are the fermi surfaces very near the midpoint of the @xmath40-k line , but they are nearly circular although not enforced by symmetry .",
    "a more provocative example is that of the layered , electron doped system li@xmath47mncl , which has up to t@xmath3=15 k for m = zr , and t@xmath3=26 k for m = hf . for @xmath48 which probably includes the accessible concentrations",
    ", this system has very nearly circular k - centered fermi surfaces whose nesting possibilities have been noted.@xcite there are surfaces at two inequivalent points k , resulting in kohn regions centered at the zone center ( degeneracy two ) and [ because k@xmath49k scattering involves momentum transfer k in the hexagonal zone ] at each of the pair of points k ( also degeneracy two ) .",
    "the figure of kohn surfaces would look like fig .",
    "[ hex19 ] with circles centered at the @xmath39 and @xmath50 points missing .",
    "indeed , heid and bohnen calculate@xcite phonon softening around k and the zone center , but alas they find that the calculated coupling strength comes well short of accounting for t@xmath3=15 k in li@xmath47zrncl ( not to mention the question of t@xmath3=26 k in li@xmath47hfncl ) .",
    "the superconductivity in this system remains unexplained , but the placement of its 2d circular fermi surfaces illustrates the first step in pulling more phonons into the coupling .      while the electronic system we seek is 2d in character ,",
    "we also seek ( strong ) coupling to phonon of arbitrary momentum and polarization .",
    "mgb@xmath6 is a bad example here , since the strong bonding lies solely within the layer ; the @xmath51-axis modes are hardly coupled .",
    "a lattice with strong bonds with substantial component perpendicular to the layers have a better likelihood of coupling to bond stretch modes . from this point of view",
    "the li@xmath47zrncl system seems to be a step in the right direction , as it has zr - n bonds both within the layer and perpendicular to it .",
    "heid and bohnen@xcite found moderate coupling both to two stiff modes ( @xmath165 mev , primarily n ) and to two softer modes ( @xmath125 mev ) .",
    "these modes are however polarized in - plane ; the perpendicular zr - n modes do not couple to the 2d electronic system .",
    "creativity will be required to find how to involve a larger fraction of modes in the coupling .",
    "since there may be people who are truly interested in this topic of room temperature superconductivity , the basic premises and concepts should be made as clear and precise as possible ( `` truth in advertising '' ) .",
    "the following issues should be mentioned .",
    "the use of the term _ optimal _ as used above was disingenuous and incorrect , and that discussion as it stands is unduly pessimistic .",
    "close - packing of @xmath52-diameter kohn circular surfaces does indeed use the area of the zone efficiently ( although mathematicians or engineers would fill the holes with smaller circles , and then again and again ad infinitum , thereby using 100% of the area ) .",
    "however , maximizing the area is _ not _ the objective .",
    "the objective is to maximize t@xmath3 or to simplify slightly for now , to maximize @xmath8 .",
    "phase space in 2d leads to the non - intuitive result that integration of @xmath34 over a kohn region of diameter @xmath52 is independent of @xmath23 , as long as the me theory we are applying holds .",
    "the objective then is to maximize the _ number _ of kohn regions .",
    "since there are likely to be different values of @xmath53 and @xmath17 for the different regions , it will be something like the quantity @xmath54_j}{\\omega_j }   \\label{optimum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that needs maximizing , where @xmath55 is the ( variable ) number of kohn regions .",
    "care must be taken to keep the kohn regions from overlapping if the combined renormalization of phonons will be so strong as to drive instability .",
    "also , the band degeneracy factor @xmath20 seems to be extremely helpful , but must be watched .",
    "[ optimum ] there would be some factor related to @xmath20 of identical terms . ) for example , in fig .",
    "[ hex19 ] each of the fermi surfaces contributes ( via intrasurface scattering ) to the coupling strength and accompanying phonon softening inside the kohn region at @xmath56 , a factor of 12 in this case .",
    "a good strategy would be to have matrix elements be larger for @xmath41 , which have smaller degeneracy factors , than for @xmath57 with its large multiplier , thereby crafting strong coupling while avoiding the @xmath58 instability .",
    "the validity of the theory bears reconsideration .",
    "it is safe to say that if @xmath59 for every phonon @xmath10 , then me ( second order perturbation ) theory is safe . if this inequality is not satisfied for a small fraction of the coupling strength , corrections are probably minor .",
    "however , for the typical strongly - coupled phonon in mgb@xmath6 , @xmath60 the condition of validity is violated badly for _ every important phonon _ , making me theory in mgb@xmath6 unjustified as pointed out earlier.@xcite nevertheless , its predictions seem to be reasonable for mgb@xmath6 , so it is reasonable for us to extrapolate the theory to include more phonons with similar strength of coupling .",
    "it was noted above that for a frequency @xmath61 60 mev as in mgb@xmath6 , @xmath62 20 is required to reach the vicinity of room temperature .",
    "while there have been many papers addressing the very strong regime and resulting polarons and bipolarons , we are not aware of any that address seriously such coupling in a degenerate electron system .",
    "there is a general expectation that the electron system becomes unstable , but unstable to what is unclear ; a degenerate gas of polarons ( of the order of one per atom ) does not seem like a clear concept .",
    "( if the instability occurs only below t@xmath3 , it may not control or limit the pairing at high temperature . )",
    "the description of such a system is still unknown ; while mgb@xmath6 has a finite concentration ( 3% ) of _ extremely _ strongly coupled phonons , the net value of @xmath8 is less than unity . following",
    "the materials design proposed here will lead to study of a new materials regime as well as higher t@xmath3 .",
    "a blueprint for the design of a room temperature superconductor has been provided here .",
    "the essence is this : very strong q - dependent coupling in a _ controlled _ fashion is possible , and one follows the path toward getting as much as one can out of both the electronic and the phononic systems .",
    "two - dimension electronic structures with circular fermi surfaces give an unsurpassed level of control of the q - dependence , which if uncontrolled can and does lead to structural instabilities even at moderate total coupling strength .",
    "stiff lattices are important , as is getting as many of the branches as possible involved in coupling .    on the one hand mgb@xmath6 ,",
    "impressive as it is , seems to be doing a poor job in most respects of making use of the available phase space .",
    "mgb@xmath6 uses only 12% of all the possible phonon momenta , and only 2/9 of its phonon branches , netting only 3% of phonons involved in coupling .",
    "mgb@xmath6 excels at producing extremely large electron - displaced ion matrix elements , and its 2d phase space keeps the extremely large coupling ( to those 3% ) firmly under control .",
    "all things considered , it seems reasonable to expect that materials exist , or can be made , that will improve on mgb@xmath6 s current record .",
    "there is no promise here , nor even expectation , that such improvement will be easy . although one can employ tight - binding models to suggest crystal structures and interatomic interactions that will place band extrema in the desired positions in the zone , synthesizing the corresponding material is more uncertain .",
    "we work with discrete nuclear charges , so this is a diophantine problem rather than a continuous one , and bonding properties can change rapidly from atom to atom .",
    "in addition , incremental improvements lead to even more incremental payoffs .",
    "the behavior@xcite of t@xmath3(@xmath8 ) @xmath63 in the strong - coupling regime , while monotonically increasing , provides a law of diminishing returns : doubling t@xmath3 requires quadrupling @xmath8 , a sobering prospect .",
    "finally , it should re - emphasized that no realistic theory of the degenerate electronic system in the presence of phonon coupling in the regime @xmath64 ( say ) exists , but this is another , perhaps better , physical reason to push to stronger coupling systems . and think of it  would nt it be really great to carry around a spool of superconducting d@xmath6e@xmath65z wire in your pocket ?",

    "<S> the vision of `` room temperature superconductivity '' has appeared intermittently but prominently in the literature since 1964 , when w. a. little and v. l. ginzburg began working on the _ problem of high temperature superconductivity _ around the same time . since that time the prospects for room temperature superconductivity have varied from gloom ( around 1980 ) to glee ( the years immediately after the discovery of hts ) , to wait - and - see ( the current feeling ) . </S>",
    "<S> recent discoveries have clarified old issues , making it possible to construct the blueprint for a viable room temperature superconductor . </S>"
