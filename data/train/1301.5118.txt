    "a fundamental result in ramsey theory , originally due to issai schur @xcite , states that given a finite partition of the natural numbers @xmath0 , one cell of the partition contains two points @xmath19 and their sum @xmath20 .",
    "an extension of schur s theorem , which we will call the _ finite finite sums theorem _ states that whenever @xmath0 is finitely partitioned , there exist arbitrarily large sets of numbers all of whose sums belong to the same element of the partition .",

    "is @xmath26-summable .",
    "in this paper we consider three different families of subsets of @xmath0 each characterized by an additive property which may be regarded as an extension of the finite finite sums theorem : finite fs - big , infinite fs - big , and ip - sets .",

    "is said to be _ partition regular _",
    "if for each @xmath30 whenever @xmath1 is partitioned into finitely many sets , at least one set of the partition is in @xmath31 by the finite sums theorem , the collection of all ip - sets is partition regular . other examples of partition regular families are sets having positive upper density , and sets having arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions .",

    "in contrast , for any fixed value of @xmath2 , the property of being @xmath2-summable or @xmath26-summable is not partition regular .",
    "for example , the set @xmath48 is clearly @xmath49-summable . on the other hand @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 and neither @xmath53 is @xmath54-summable .",
    "nevertheless , for each fixed @xmath2 we could consider the set @xmath55 then each @xmath56 is non - empty .",
    "in fact every ip - set belongs to @xmath56 .",
    "it is a difficult open question of imre leader s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 8.1 ) whether there is any member of @xmath57 which is not an ip - set . in general , the question of determining whether a given subset @xmath58 is in @xmath56 or is an ip - set is typically quite difficult , even if for every @xmath59 either @xmath1 or its complement belongs to @xmath56 or is an ip - set .",
    "in this note we focus on sets @xmath1 which are defined in terms of the binary expansions of its elements . in this respect",
    "it is natural to consider the _ thue - morse infinite word _",
    "@xmath60 where @xmath61 is defined as the sum modulo @xmath54 of the digits in the binary expansion of @xmath62 the thue - morse word is @xmath54-automatic  @xcite : in fact @xmath61 is computed by feeding the binary expansion of @xmath35 in the deterministic finite automata depicted in figure  [ gtau ] .",
    "starting from the initial state labeled @xmath63 we read the binary expansion of @xmath35 starting from the most significant digit .",
    "then @xmath61 is the corresponding terminal state .",
    "for example , the binary representation of @xmath64 is @xmath65 and the path @xmath65 starting at @xmath66 terminates at vertex @xmath67 whence @xmath68    ( 25 , 10)(0,-5 ) ( a1)(0,0)@xmath66 ( a1)@xmath66 ( a2)(25,0)@xmath69 ( a2)@xmath66 ( a1,a2)@xmath69 ( a2,a1)@xmath69    [ gtau ]    the origins of @xmath16 go back to the beginning of the last century with the works of the norwegian mathematician axel thue @xcite .",
    "thue noted that every binary word of length four contains a square , that is two consecutive equal blocks",
    "@xmath70 he then asked whether it was possible to find an infinite word on @xmath71 distinct symbols which avoided squares .",
    "he also asked whether there exists an infinite binary word without cubes , that is with no three consecutive equal blocks .",
    "thue showed that in each case the answer is positive and constructed this very special infinite word @xmath16 to produce the desired words .",
    "in fact the word @xmath16 contains no fractional power greater than @xmath72 i.e. , contains no word of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a prefix of @xmath75 thue s work originally appeared in an obscure norwegian journal and for many years remained largely unknown and unappreciated .    a few years later in the 1920s",
    ", marston morse and gustav hedlund @xcite were pioneering a new branch of mathematics known as symbolic dynamics , inspired by the study of various classical dynamical systems dating back to newton .",
    "the basic idea of symbolic dynamics consists in dividing up the set of possible states into a finite number of pieces . by discretizing both space and time",
    ", one could model a dynamical system @xmath76 by a space consisting of infinite words of abstract symbols , each symbol corresponding to a state of the system , and a shift operator corresponding to the dynamics .",
    "thus from this point of view , the orbits of motion are described as _ symbolic trajectories _ or _",
    "a periodic orbit would give rise to a periodic infinite word , while an aperiodic orbit would correspond to an aperiodic infinite word .",
    "curiously enough , these foundational works of morse and hedlund exhibited strong ties with the earlier work of thue .",
    "this connection stems through the use of infinite words to describe infinite geodesic curves on a surface of negative curvature . and",
    "so , the word @xmath16 originally defined by thue to study combinatorial properties of words was rediscovered in 1921 by morse @xcite in connection with differential geometry .",
    "he proved that every surface of negative curvature having at least two normal segments , admits a continuum of recurrent aperiodic geodesics .",
    "an alternative definition of the thue - morse word which will be useful to us is in terms of the morphism @xmath77 given by @xmath13 and @xmath78 more precisely , iterating @xmath79 on the symbol @xmath66 gives @xmath80 in general , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is obtained from @xmath83 by exchanging @xmath66 s and @xmath69 s .",
    "in particular , since @xmath83 is a prefix of @xmath84 the sequence @xmath85 tends in the limit to the infinite word @xmath86 for more background and information on the thue - morse word we refer the reader to @xcite or @xcite .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the word obtained from @xmath16 by exchange of @xmath66 s and @xmath69 s , i.e. , @xmath87 is the fixed point of the thue - morse morphism beginning in @xmath69 .",
    "we consider subsets of @xmath0 defined by the thue - morse word via occurrences of its factors .",
    "more precisely , writing @xmath88 with @xmath89 for each factor @xmath15 of @xmath16 we set @xmath90 in other words , @xmath18 denotes the set of all occurrences of @xmath15 in @xmath16 .",
    "the main result of this note is to obtain a full characterization of each of the sets @xmath18 in terms of the three additive properties defined above .",
    "we show that factors of the thue - morse word can be split into three classes : one corresponding to factors @xmath15 for which @xmath18 is an ip - set ; these factors are precisely all prefixes of @xmath16 .",
    "the second class consists of all factors @xmath15 such that @xmath18 is infinite fs - big but not an ip - set ; this corresponds to all prefixes of @xmath87 . finally , for all remaining factors @xmath15 of @xmath16 ,",
    "the set @xmath18 is not @xmath71-summable , and in some cases not even @xmath54-summable ( see theorem  [ main ] ) .",
    "we also show that the set @xmath91 may be partitioned into two cells neither of which is @xmath49-summable ( see lemma  [ tm1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the collection of all infinite fs - big sets is not partition regular ( see corollary  [ notpartreg ] ) .",
    "as pointed out to us by the referees of this paper , this latter point may be proved independently of the thue - morse word ( either directly using the binary representation of digits without reference to @xmath16 , or via other digital representations of the integers ) .",
    "our use of @xmath16 is merely one of convenience as it provides a uniform framework on which to investigate the various additive properties defined above .",
    "we conclude this introduction with some notation that we will be using .",
    "we denote the set of all @xmath2-summable subsets of @xmath0 by @xmath92 and the set of all finite fs - big subsets of @xmath0 by @xmath93 .",
    "thus , @xmath94 . we denote the set of all @xmath26-summable sets by @xmath95 and the set of all infinite fs - big sets by @xmath96 so that @xmath97 .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we have seen that @xmath100 .",
    "more generally , for each @xmath101 we have that @xmath102 this follows immediately from the following simple lemma which is likely a well known fact but the authors were unable to find it in the literature .",
    "we thus include a proof here for the sake of completeness .",
    "given any set @xmath103 of @xmath2 nonnegative integers , some subset @xmath104 of @xmath103 sums up to @xmath66 modulo @xmath7 i.e. , @xmath105 for some @xmath106    equivalently , given a @xmath2-term sequence @xmath107 in the cyclic group @xmath108 of order @xmath7 we will show that some subsequence sums up to @xmath109 to see this , for each @xmath110 define sets @xmath111 recursively as follows : @xmath112 and for @xmath113 set @xmath114 in other words @xmath115 we claim that @xmath116 for some @xmath117 i.e. , some subsequence of @xmath118 sums to @xmath109 in fact , for each @xmath117 if @xmath119 then @xmath120 ( since @xmath121 thus if for every @xmath122 we had that @xmath123 then @xmath124 a contradiction ( since @xmath125    * acknowledgements : * the authors would like to express their gratitude to the two referees of this paper . in particular one of the referees suggested a simplification to the proof of item ( 1 ) of theorem  [ main ] which we decided to use , as well as an alternative simple but clever proof that the collection of all infinite fs - big sets is not partition regular which we included as one of two proofs of corollary  [ notpartreg ] .",
    "in this section we prove that the collection of all finite fs - big sets is partition regular ( see theorem  [ fsbpr ] below ) .",
    "surprisingly the authors were unable to find a proof of this fact in the existing literature .",
    "thus we take this opportunity to present two different derivations : our first proof is a straightforward application of the so - called finite finite unions theorem ( see theorem  [ ffu ] below ) and is by now quite routine to experts in ramsey theory .",
    "our second proof uses a clever argument suggested to us by imre leader which establishes theorem [ ffu ] using only the finite finite sums theorem ( theorem [ ffs ] ) and ramsey s theorem @xcite .    throughout this section",
    "we will use the notation @xmath126 for the set of all non - empty finite subsets of @xmath1 and let @xmath127 .",
    "we first observe that we had some choices to make when we defined @xmath2-summable .",
    "that is , we could have defined @xmath1 to be @xmath2-summable@xmath128 if there is a sequence @xmath5 such that @xmath129 ; we could have defined @xmath1 to be @xmath2-summable@xmath130 if there is an increasing sequence @xmath5 such that @xmath129 ; and we could have defined @xmath1 to be @xmath2-summable@xmath131 if there is a sequence @xmath5 satisfying uniqueness of finite sums such that @xmath129 .",
    "( we actually chose @xmath2-summable@xmath131 because it generalizes most naturally to arbitrary semigroups as in theorem [ fsbpr ] . )",
    "these notions are progressively strictly stronger .",

    "however , for the notion of finite fs - big subsets of @xmath0 , it does not matter which choice was made for @xmath2-summable .",
    "the reason is that for each @xmath2 there is some @xmath135 such that if @xmath1 is an @xmath135-summable@xmath128 subset of @xmath0 , then @xmath1 is @xmath2-summable@xmath130 .",

    "the main key for proving that finite fs - big sets are partition regular is the finite finite unions theorem .",
