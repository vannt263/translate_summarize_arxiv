    "after generation , the turbulence kinetic energy cascades from larger to smaller scales .",

    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the inertial range includes length scales @xmath33 , i.e. , length scales shorter than those on which energy flows into the turbulence and larger than those on which the turbulence energy is dissipated .",
    "we also assume that the energy is injected into the turbulence continuously over a time @xmath26 , rather than as an instantaneous impulse @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) unequal time correlations are modeled as @xcite @xmath34 , \\label{spectrumtime}\\ ] ] where the @xmath35 dependence of the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 reflects the assumption of time translation invariance . since energy is injected continuously , at @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40",

    "it has been speculated that in a magnetized medium an iroshnikov - kraichnan spectrum with @xmath54 might develop instead .",
    "the presence of hydrodynamical helicity makes the situation more complex .",
    "two possibilities have been discussed .",
    "first , with a forward cascade ( from large to small scales ) of both energy and helicity ( dominated by energy dissipation on small scales ) one has spectral indices @xmath53 and @xmath55 ( the helical kolmogorov ( hk ) spectrum ) , p.  243 of ref .",
    "second , if helicity transfer and small - scale helicity dissipation dominate , @xmath56 ( the helicity transfer ( ht ) spectrum ) @xcite .",
    "the hk spectrum has been observed in the inertial range of weakly helical turbulence ( i.e. , where @xmath57 ) @xcite . for strongly helical hydrodynamical turbulence",
    "the characteristic small - scale length scale of helicity dissipation is larger than the kolmogorov energy dissipation length scale @xcite .",
    "therefore here the inertial range is taken to consist of two sub - intervals , both with power - law spectra . for smaller @xmath58 the spectra",
    "are determined by helicity transfer and have @xmath56 , while for larger @xmath58 turbulence becomes non - helical and the more common hk spectrum is realized . since gw generation",
    "is mostly determined by the physics at small @xmath58 ( near @xmath59 ) @xcite , it is fair to only use the ht spectrum in this case also @xcite .    based on these considerations we model the primordial spectra as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where : ( i ) for the hk case @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite , implying @xmath64 ; and , ( ii ) for the ht case @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are the energy and mean helicity dissipation rates per unit enthalpy , and @xmath69 ( the kolmogorov constant ) , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are constants of order unity .",
    "the formalism described here is applicable for locally isotropic turbulence .",
    "another requirement is connected with plasma viscosity , i.e. the reynolds number @xmath72 , which is related to the cut - off scales @xmath59 and @xmath73 ( for hk case , @xmath74 ) , has to be enough large @xcite . summarizing , to model cosmological turbulence it is required to know @xcite : ( i ) the part of the vacuum energy converted to the turbulent motions @xmath75 ; ( ii ) the `` stirring '' scale @xmath16 ; ( iii ) the temperature of the universe @xmath76 when turbulence is generated .",
    "this temperature defines the energy density and enthalpy ( @xmath77 ) of the plasma ; ( iv ) the ratio between energy and helicity dissipation rates @xmath78 . knowing these quantities and the turbulent motion spectral index , we are able to obtain the damping scale @xmath73 and the plasma viscosity @xmath79 ( p.  483 of ref .",
    "in particular , for locally isotropic turbulence the energy dissipation rate @xmath80 is equal to the source power input , i.e. , @xmath81 where @xmath14 is the phase transition efficiency . for hk turbulence with @xmath53 ,",
    "the damping scale is related to plasma viscosity via @xcite @xmath82 for the ht spectrum ( @xmath83 ) the damping scale is connected with plasma viscosity and the dissipation rates @xmath84 and @xmath85 via @xmath86 ; using the fact that the total energy density of turbulent motion @xmath87 , we find @xcite @xmath88 the @xmath89-scale eddy turnover ( circulation ) time can be obtained as a ratio of length scale @xmath89 to the physical velocity @xmath90 related to the normalization of the symmetric part of turbulent motion spectrum @xmath22 ( or the energy dissipation rate @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is easy to find that @xmath92 for any @xmath89 inside the inertial range @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "it should be underlined that we use the non - relativistic turbulence model to describe processes in the early universe .",
    "the kolmogorov model of turbulence has been proved only for non - relativistic velocities in plasma , and there is no standard model for the relativistic case .",
    "we have also used the non - compressible plasma approximation .",
    "for the realistic case of a compressible fluid one can expect that a large enough input of energy may lead to the formation of shocks . on the other hand ,",
    "our assumption that the upper limit of plasma velocity is equal to sound speed may be justified because of significant thermal dissipation due to shock waves .",
    "presuming that shock fronts accumulate kinetic energy , the gravitational radiation signal will be increased ( relative to the non - relativistic case ) , if we account for relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "since the turbulent source acts a short time ( comparing with hubble time - scale ) , the expansion of the universe can be neglected in the gw equation of motion , then in wave - number space we get @xcite @xmath94 here @xmath95 is the newtonian gravitational constant .",
