    "non  abelian discrete symmetries have found applications in explaining aspects of the flavor question not addressed by the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",

    "maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing angles in terms of the quark mass ratios @xcite .",
    "such symmetries have been employed successfully to generate a geometric structure for the leptonic mixing angles , independent of the lepton mass ratios @xcite .",
    "the non  abelian discrete symmetric structure @xmath6 appears to bode well within the supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model , since the same symmetry can also provide a natural solution to the excessive flavor change that occurs with generic soft susy breaking terms @xcite .",
    "the three families of quarks and leptons will transform as doublets or triplets of the group @xmath6 , which would result in the degeneracy of their masses .",
    "degenerate squarks ( and sleptons ) would alleviate the susy flavor violation problem .",
    "if the non  abelian symmetry is continuous @xcite and gauged @xcite , there is flavor violation arising from the @xmath7terms of the flavor group @xcite .",
    "continuous global symmetries are susceptible to explicit violation from quantum gravity .",
    "non  abelian discrete symmetries which have a gauge origin are free from these problems and deserve special considerations @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a susy model based on the non  abelian discrete group @xmath0  the binary dihedral group of order 12 .",
    "this group has two inequivalent doublet representations , one real doublet , and one pseudo ",
    "real doublet , which can be handy for model building . in the flavor sector",
    "this symmetry results in one prediction for for a combination of the ckm mixing parameters , which was shown to be consistent with data .",
    "the quark and lepton superfields are assigned to doublets and singlets of @xmath0 , with the singlets identified as belonging to the third family . in the @xmath0",
    "symmetric limit the squarks of the first two families would be degenerate , which is sufficient to solve the susy flavor problem . furthermore , by assuming that cp violation has a spontaneous origin , this model also solves the susy cp problem .",
    "excessive cp violating processes arising from the susy breaking sector are absent , since the parameters are all real .",
    "yet the model admits cp violation in the quark mixing matrix",
    ".    one major purpose of the present paper is to show that the @xmath0 model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite admits a new minimum which violates cp , but leaves a new interchange symmetry in tact . by virtue of this interchange symmetry",
    ", we derive a new sum rule among the quark mixing parameters and cp violation , which is found to be consistent with observations . such an interchange symmetry was present in ref .",
    "@xcite as well , but the new one presented here is different , although it arises from the same higgs potential .",
    "we extend this symmetry to the lepton sector and obtain interesting correlations between the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "we also compare the predictions of the new minimum with those of the old , and in the process update our old predictions .",
    "we use the most recent values of light quark masses where the errors have decreased significantly as a result of improved lattice calculations .",
    "we compare the model predictions to the best fit values obtained in the sm as well as by including certain new physics contributions in @xmath8 mixings as obtained by the ckffitter group @xcite .",
    "these new contributions are motivated by certain discrepancies obtained in the sm ckm fits  such as the differences of order 20% in the cp violation parameter @xmath9 obtained from fits to @xmath10 and @xmath11 decay .",
    "small new physics contributions naturally arise in our @xmath0 based model .",
    "for example , there are contributions to meson  antimeson mixing via susy box diagrams , which may be important for the @xmath12 meson system since the third family squark is not degenerate with the first two family squarks .",
    "we also present a complete higgs potential that leads to the spontaneous breaking of cp symmetry and the @xmath0 flavor symmetry without leading to pseudo  nambu ",
    "goldstone bosons .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 , a flavor universal @xmath13 symmetry is introduced .",
    "owing to this @xmath13 , even after spontaneous symmetry breaking , an unbroken interchange symmetry survives in the higgs potential , for which there are two possible choices , denoted as @xmath14 .",
    "these symmetries , along with @xmath0 , reduce significantly the number of parameters in the fermion mass matrices .",
    "this reduction of parameters leads to a sum rule involving quark masses and mixings @xcite .",
    "moreover , cp violation has a spontaneous origin , which is perhaps more satisfying than the usual assumption of explicit cp violation . nevertheless , the dominant source of cp violation in the quark sector is the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism .",
    "the sum rule involving quark masses and mixings that has been derived relies on the spontaneous violation of cp . with this",
    ", the problem of excessive cp violation that generically exists in the soft susy breaking sector can be solved in a rather simple way .",

    "the @xmath0 model of flavor is constructed to solve the susy flavor problem of the supersymmetric standard model .",
    "it also yields an interesting prediction for the quark mixing parameters , which compares very well with experimental data .",
    "an unbroken interchange symmetry plays an important role in obtaining the quark mixing parameter prediction . in this paper",
    "we have updated this prediction , and compared it with the best fit values within the standard model as well as with new physics contributions assumed in @xmath8 mixing amplitudes .",
    "the model prediction is in very good agreement with the data .",
    "a major observation of the present paper is the existence of a new minimum that violates cp symmetry spontaneously , but leaves a new interchange symmetry unbroken . in this minimum",
    ", there is again a prediction for quark mixing parameters .",
    "we have analyzed this prediction and found that it fits data ( within the ckm model and with new physics included ) rather well .",
    "we have extended this symmetry to the leptonic sector , and have found various correlations between neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "we conclude with several comments on the new solution found .    *",
    "( 1 ) * the susy flavor problem is solved in the new ground state @xmath16 in the same way it is solved in @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath0 invariance requires the first two family squarks and sleptons to be degenerate in mass , which provides the needed susy gim mechanism . since after @xmath0 breaking the @xmath0 doublet and singlet quark states mix , there is residual flavor violation mediated by the susy particles , but such fcnc processes are well within experimental limits .    * ( 2 ) * the susy cp problem is solved in the model by virtue of spontaneous cp violation .",
    "the fundamental parameters in the lagrangian are all real , complex phases develop only spontaneously via the vevs of @xmath48 and @xmath182 fields .",
    "this implies that the soft susy breaking parameters such as the gluino mass are all real , which alleviates bulk of the susy phase problem .",
    "the trilinear susy breaking @xmath100terms are not proportional to the corresponding yukawa couplings , however the phases in these @xmath100terms , since they arise spontaneously , will align with the phases in the fermion mass matrices .",
    "thus the @xmath100terms do not generate cp violation .",
    "there is cp violation arising from the @xmath183terms , but as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , if the higgsino masses are parametrically smaller than the squark and slepton masses , this cp violation is not excessive .",
    "we also note that in the new minimum @xmath16 , the spontaneously induced phase that is necessary for km cp violation is rather small , @xmath184 .",
    "one can then assume an approximate cp symmetry for the entire lagrangian , where all the phases remain small , of this order .",
    "this will further suppress the susy phase effects .    *",
    "( 3 ) * the new interchange symmetry @xmath16 might appear to be cp transformation , but it actually is not .",
    "if it were cp transformation , when extended to the fermion yukawa sector , that would make the parameters @xmath185 in eq .",
    "( [ wyuk ] ) purely imaginary .",
    "cp violation will then disappear from the ckm matrix , as it should , since this symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "the symmetry @xmath16 is an accidental symmetry of the higgs potential , and is not respected by the yukawa couplings , just as it was for the interchange symmetry @xmath15 .",
    "this state leads to a new sum rule involving the quark masses and ckm mixing parameters , which is found to be in good agreement with data .",
    "extension of the model to the neutrino sector , by changing the @xmath0 assignment of the leptons , can lead to a predictive scenario . in this version",
    "we find that neutrino mass hierarchy is inverted with nearly maximal cp violation along with nearly maximal mixing of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "thus the model lends itself to experimental scrutiny in the near future .    * ( 4 ) * the question of whether it is possible to obtain a large cp violation in the @xmath186 mixing for the case of @xmath16 , as in the case of @xmath98 @xcite , remains to be studied . to distinguish two ground states of the same model , precise measurements of the ckm parameters @xcite and neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite as well as precise determination of the quark masses",
    "@xcite are indispensable .",
