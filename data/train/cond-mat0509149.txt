    "the understanding of low - temperature properties of doped mott insulators is a central challenge in solid state physics . from the numerical point of view , this problem has remained elusive due to the sign problem .",

    "they show that the density matrix of an arbitrary model hamiltonian may be expressed as a positive sum over gaussian operators .",
    "the imaginary time propagation of the density matrix boils down to a fokker - planck equation governing the time evolution of the probability distribution in the space of gaussian operators .",
    "one can then solve the fokker - planck equation by integrating numerically the corresponding stochastic differential equation ( sde ) .",
    "for the hubbard model on arbitrary lattice topologies and at arbitrary band fillings , the sde has real stochastic and drift forces thereby leading to no explicit sign problem .",
    "the aim of this article is to test the precision of the method with respect to ground state properties .",
    "we will see  on the basis of simple examples  that the low temperature density matrix obtained by solving the sde numerically does not have the symmetry of the hamiltonian thereby producing biased ground state properties .",
    "the problem stems from the fact that a single gaussian operator breaks spin , lattice as well as translation symmetries .",
    "since the weighted summation over the gaussian operators produces the density matrix , the summation has to restore the symmetries of the problem at hand .",
    "however the summation is carried out stochastically , and it is a - priori not clear that the sampling is efficient enough to restore symmetries . at _ high _ temperatures this poses no further problems but as the temperature is lowered symmetry restoration fails .",
