    "the classical theory of @xmath2-functions is a rich and beautiful subject that weaves threads from a diverse set of mathematical disciplines .",
    "it is the purpose of this note to describe a generalization of this theory when viewed from a geometric / representation theoretic point of view .",
    "it is the authors hope that this generalization will not only illustrate interesting new connections between @xmath2-functions and symplectic geometry , but also clarify some aspects of the classical theory by comparison .",
    "we will develop a theory of @xmath2-functions associated to the kodaira ",
    "thurston manifold , a certain nontrivial 2-torus bundle over a 2-torus , realized here as a compact nilmanifold , which is symplectic but _ not _ khler .",
    "it seems that our constructions are not unique to this situation and could be adapted to other compact nilmanifolds . just as in the classical theory , @xmath2-functions associated to the kodaira ",
    "thurston @xmath0 manifold arise when studying the decomposition of the @xmath5-space of sections of certain line bundles over @xmath0 .",
    "the construction we give is intimately related to the symplectic structure of @xmath0 .",
    "the main results of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , we give a construction of @xmath2-functions on @xmath0 which parallels the classical theory , where possible .",
    "the construction we present of @xmath2-functions on @xmath0 uses the representation theory of an associated nilpotent lie group @xmath6 , just as the classical @xmath2-functions are intimately related to the heisenberg group ( in fact , @xmath4 can be interpreted as `` the heisenberg group on @xmath7 '' ) .",
    "the second main result of this paper is a connection between the algebraic structure of @xmath4 and the symplectic structure of @xmath0 . to make the construction of @xmath2-functions explicit requires a choice : a subalgebra @xmath8 of @xmath9 of a certain type ( subordinate to a @xmath1-dimensional integral coadjoint orbit , to be precise ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath8 is connected to the symplectic structure of @xmath0 ; we will see that each subordinate subalgebra @xmath8 corresponds to a lagrangian foliation of @xmath0 .",
    "if the subordinate subalgebra is an ideal , then the foliation is special lagrangian .",
    "( our proof of this fact is indirect ; we enumerate all possible relevant subordinate subalgebras and observe that those which are ideals induce special lagrangian fibrations . ) the family of such subordinate subalgebras can be parameterized by @xmath10 , and in a certain parametrization , those foliations associated to the subalgebras corresponding to @xmath11 and @xmath12 are torus fibrations .    in the remainder of this introduction , we will state our main results ( though we leave some technical details for later ) .",
    "next , we give an overview of the classical theory of @xmath2-functions so that the analogy of our results with the classical theory is apparent .",
    "we then briefly review the tool which we use to generalize @xmath2-functions to our situation : a generalization of geometric quantization to the symplectic category which is known as almost khler quantization .",
    "we conclude this section with a summary of the rest of the paper .",
    "let @xmath13 be the direct product of the three - dimensional heisenberg group with the real line .",
    "denote by @xmath14 the integer lattice in @xmath15 .",
    "the _ kodaira ",
    "thurston manifold _ is the compact quotient @xmath16 .",
    "it can be equipped with a left @xmath15-invariant integral symplectic form @xmath17 and complex structure ( see kodaira s work @xcite ) , but , as thurston was the first to observe @xcite , it is _ not _ a khler manifold ; that is , the metric defined by any choice of complex structure and symplectic structure is not positive definite . in this paper , we will primarily be interested in the symplectic structure of @xmath0 .",
    "since we assume @xmath17 is integral , there is a hermitian line bundle @xmath18 with compatible connection whose curvature is the symplectic form .",
    "as we will see , there exists a central extension @xmath19 such that @xmath4 acts on @xmath0 in a hamiltonian fashion .",

    "this new group is , of course , the well - known heisenberg group described by the short exact sequence @xmath132    the heisenberg group can be realized in many equivalent ways . for what comes",

    "the quotient @xmath139 is a compact manifold .",
