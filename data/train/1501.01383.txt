    "the envelope theory ( et ) , aslo known as the auxiliary field method , is a technique to obtain approximate solutions of @xmath0-body hamiltonians in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it has been recently extended to treat systems with arbitrary kinematics in @xmath1-dimension @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to replace the hamiltonian @xmath2 under study by an auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath3 which is solvable , the eigenvalues of @xmath3 being optimized to be as close as possible to those of @xmath2 .",
    "the method is easy to implement since it reduces to find the solution of a transcendental equation . in the most favourable cases ,",
    "the approximate eigenvalue is an analytical lower or upper bound . in less favourable situations , a nonvariational numerical approximation can be computed .",
    "this is often interesting for @xmath0-body problems which are always difficult and very heavy to solve numerically .    in a recent paper @xcite , accurate ground state energies and correlation functions of bosons interacting via various potentials",
    "are calculated using explicitly correlated gaussian ( ecg ) basis @xcite .",
    "up to 8 particles are considered , allowing a plenty of numerical results to test the accuracy of the et for eigenvalues and eigenvectors ( the quality of eigenvectors for the et has only been tested for @xmath4 @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the purpose of the et is not to compete with methods such as the ecg .",
    "the main goal of the et is to produce without great pain reliable estimations for the energy of a @xmath0-body system .",
    "if a lower or an upper bound can be produced , this must be sufficient for some applications or can be used as a test for heavy numerical computations . in the peculiar situations where an analytical expression is obtained",
    ", the result can give valuable insights about the system .",
    "in several cases , it has been shown that the approximation given by the et can be largely improved by modifying the structure of the characteristic global quantum number of the method @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the kind of modification must be guessed for each system , and can be found precisely only by comparing with several exact ( or accurate estimation of ) eigenvalues . clearly , a better defined procedure would be preferable .",
    "a universal effective quantum number for centrally symmetric 2-body systems is proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will show that this notion can be used to improve the et .",
    "let us note that the variational character of the approximation can not be guaranteed when the global quantum number is modified .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the et method is recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : et ] , where a modification of the global quantum number is proposed to improve the quality of the approximation .",
    "the accuracy of the method is tested with various systems in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] .",
    "some concluding remarks are finally given .",
    "here we consider the @xmath0-body hamiltonian , in a @xmath1 dimensional space ( @xmath5 ) , for identical particles with a kinetic energy @xmath6 , interacting via the one - body @xmath7 and two - body @xmath8 interactions ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the centre of mass position .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that an approximate eigenvalue @xmath13 is given by the following set of equations for a completely ( anti)symmetrized state : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the number of particle pairs , and @xmath17 is a global quantum number ( corresponding to @xmath18 identical harmonic oscillators ) . following the forms of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the approximate value @xmath13 can have a variational character .",
    "the corresponding approximate eigenstate is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a @xmath1-dimensional harmonic oscillator wavefunction @xcite , depending on the jacobi coordinate @xmath21 @xcite , and decreasing asymptotically like @xmath22 ( the magnetic quantum number is omitted ) .",
    "the function @xmath23 , which can be an oscillator state , describes the centre of mass motion ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the scale parameters @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 a state  ( [ piphi ] ) has neither a defined total angular momentum nor a good symmetry , but its is characterized by a parity @xmath27 . by combining such states with the same value of @xmath28 , it is generally possible to build a physical state with good quantum numbers and good symmetry properties , but the task can be technically very complicated , even for @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "it is possible to compute mean values for the power of interparticle distance @xmath30 with the pair correlation function defined by @xmath31 the value at origin , @xmath32 , of the radial part of this density is also interesting to compute . for the bosonic ground state ( @xmath33 ) , which is completely symmetrical , we have @xmath34    in @xcite , it is shown that an effective quantum number @xmath35 that determines with high accuracy the level ordering of centrally symmetric 2-body systems has the following structure differs from the one used in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath36 where the number @xmath37 depends on the system .",
    "for instance , exact results are obtained for a harmonic oscillator with @xmath38 , and for a coulomb system with @xmath39 . in the dominantly orbital state ( dos )",
    "method @xcite , the approximate solutions are found by quantizing the radial motion around a semiclassical solution for a circular motion . the same separation in a radial quantum number @xmath40 and",
    "an orbital quantum number @xmath41 naturally occurs in this method .",
    "its extension to 3-body systems seems to preserve the same separation @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown , in the framework of the et , that relations exist linking the energy of a @xmath0-body system to the energy of the corresponding 2-body system by a rescaling of the global quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "so , it is tempting to try to modify the global quantum number @xmath28 as @xmath42 which partly breaks the strong degeneracy of @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 can be determined by theoretical considerations , or by a fit on a single known accurate solution . in the following",
    ", @xmath28 will be systematically replaced by @xmath43 .",
    "the genuine et , with its possible variational solutions , is then recovered with @xmath38 . for other values of @xmath37 ,",
    "the variational character of the solution can not be guaranteed .",
    "in this section , we consider various systems of @xmath0 identical particles with the same mass @xmath44 .",
    "the et formalism developed is valid for bosons or fermions with any values of @xmath1 , but we will show only numerical results for bosons in the @xmath45 space .",
    "for the three first nonrelativistic systems taken from and named as in @xcite , only the ground state is computed .",
    "the fourth case is an ultrarelativistic 3-body system studied in @xcite , for which excited states are also available .      in the first case ,",
    "the nonrelativistic particles interact via a soft gaussian potential @xmath46 the resolution of the system ( [ afm1n]-[afm3n ] ) gives the following upper bound for the energy @xmath13 @xmath47 the multivalued lambert function @xmath48 is the inverse function of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "@xmath50 is the branch defined for @xmath51 .    in order to test the quality of the approximation with accurate data , we compare with the results given in @xcite , for the parameters @xmath52 ( a.u.)@xmath53  k , @xmath54  k and @xmath55  a.u .",
    "results for the ground state energies @xmath13 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : wibe ] ( the exact result for @xmath56 is taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the agreement is quite good for the genuine et , but irrelevant values for the energies ( complex or positive real numbers ) are computed when the binding is very weak . this phenomenon has already been observed in @xcite for @xmath4 . note that excited values of the energies are available up to @xmath57 in @xcite , but the et method can only produce one relevant value of the energy for @xmath57 .",
    "so no tendency can be shown as a function of @xmath0 . a better agreement with the exact values for @xmath58",
    "is obtained for @xmath59 , but the improvement is not spectacular .",
    "mean values @xmath60 are presented with @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : wibobs ] .",
    "the global agreement is good , but the value @xmath59 does not necessarily produce an improvement .",
    "note that the values of @xmath32 are not so well reproduced .",
    "this is typical for a given value of a density .",
    "better results are obtained for mean values , for which an integration is performed with the density over the whole domain of distances .          in this case",
    ", we consider nonrelativistic particle interacting via a coulomb - like potential @xmath61 for a self - gravitating system , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the et method gives the following upper bound @xmath64 for @xmath4 , the exact result is recovered with @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "moreover , for @xmath45 and @xmath39 , the ground state bosonic energy is @xmath65 this is comparable with the lower bound obtained in @xcite @xmath66    as in the previous case , the comparison is performed with @xcite , for the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "results for the ground state energies @xmath13 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgbe ] for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "if the global tendency is good for the genuine et , as indicated by the log - log plot , a spectacular improvement is reached with @xmath39 ( a better global agreement with the exact values for @xmath69 is obtained for @xmath70 ) .",
    "mean values @xmath60 are presented with @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgbobs ] .",
    "again , for the genuine et , values of @xmath60 are globally better reproduced than values of @xmath32 .",
    "the strong improvement obtained for the energy is not repeated for these observables .",
    "now , we consider particles confined by a harmonic oscillator potential with a pairwise repulsive coulomb interaction @xmath71 the et method gives the following lower bound @xmath72 @xmath73 is the only positive root of the quartic equation @xmath74 with @xmath75 @xcite . with @xmath76 . ]",
    "one can check that @xmath77 when @xmath78 , which is the exact solution in this case .",
    "again , the comparison is performed with @xcite , for the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath79 and @xmath68 .",
    "the hamiltonian studied in this reference is defined with @xmath80 , that is to say with the centre of mass motion ruled by a harmonic oscillator , with a mass @xmath81 and a frequency @xmath82 .",
    "so , to compare the results of this paper with ours , we must add the value @xmath83 ( centre of mass ground state energy ) to the internal energy of the ground state of our hamiltonian ( [ hcb ] ) .",
    "results for the ground state energies @xmath13 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbe ] .",
    "the agreement is quite good for the genuine et . with the values chosen for the parameters ,",
    "an analytical solution can be found for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this exact result can be reproduced by our formula with @xmath84 .",
    "a better global agreement is obtained for this value of @xmath37 , but the improvement is very weak .",
    "mean values @xmath60 are presented with @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbobs ] .",
    "the agreement of the genuine et results is just reasonable , with again the values of @xmath60 better reproduced than the values of @xmath32 . in this case ,",
    "the quality of the observables is deteriorated for @xmath84 .",
    "light baryons in a particular large-@xmath0 limit ( @xmath0 is the number of colours ) can be studied with the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath85 the baryons are then composed of @xmath0 quarks @xmath86 or @xmath87 , with @xmath88 , moving ultrarelativistically .",
    "quarks are fermions , but the colour part of the wave - function is completely antisymmetrical .",
    "so , they behave like bosons for the rest of the wave - function . with the et , the following upper bound",
    "is obtained for the mass @xmath13 of the baryons @xmath89    in order to test the relevance of @xmath43 for the ground state and some excited states , we consider the 3-body system studied in @xcite .",
    "for the genuine et ( @xmath38 ) , the mean relative error @xmath90 computed on the 16 eigenmasses listed in table  [ tab:1 ] is 15.1% . with the value @xmath91 predicted by the dos method for @xmath78 @xcite , @xmath90",
    "reduces to 4.4% . with @xmath92 ,",
    "the et yields the exact value for the ground states and @xmath90 drops to 3.1% .",
