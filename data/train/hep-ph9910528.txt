    "the electron - photon collision mode of an @xmath1 linear collider @xcite provides us with the possibility to produce single selectrons in association with the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is assumed to be the lightest neutralino @xmath2 .",
    "thus selectrons can be produced with masses beyond the kinematical range for pair production at an @xmath1 linear collider .",
    "also the production mechanism ( electron exchange in the s - channel and selectron exchange in the t - channel ) for associated selectron - neutralino production is simpler than that for selectron pair production in @xmath1 collisions . assuming a common scalar mass @xmath3 at the unification point the masses of the selectrons are related to the mssm parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the @xmath6 gaugino mass parameter , by renormalization group equations @xcite . in the mssm",
    "quite generally the right selectron @xmath7 is lighter than the left selectron @xmath8 . in extended susy models ,",
    "however , @xmath7 could be heavier than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we study in this paper the process @xmath9 with polarized beams .",
    "since the cross section and the forward - backward asymmetry of the decay electron depend sensitively on the selectron masses this process is suitable for testing the renormalization group relation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the associated production of selectrons and the lsp proceeds via @xmath12 exchange in the s - channel and @xmath13 exchange in the t - channel . in the narrow width approximation the total cross section @xmath14 for the combined process of @xmath15 production and the subsequent decay @xmath16 factorizes into the production cross section @xmath17 and the leptonic branching ratio : @xmath18 the measured cross section @xmath19 in the @xmath1 cms is obtained by folding @xmath14 with the energy spectrum @xmath20 of the compton backscattered laser beam taking into account the mean helicity of the photon beam @xcite : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 is the circular photon asymmetry and @xmath24 is the ratio of the photon energy and the energy of the converted electron beam .",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath25 and the mean helicity @xmath26 of the high energy photon beam sensitively depend on the polarizations @xmath27 of the laser beam and @xmath28 of the converted electron beam . beyond the cross section @xmath29 , we study the forward - backward asymmetry of the decay electrons : @xmath30 the forward direction is defined by the electron beam .",
    "apart from the kinematics the selectron masses enter the cross sections and the forward - backward asymmetries explicitly via the selectron propagator in the t - channel . assuming a common scalar mass @xmath3 at the unification point the masses of the selectrons are related to the mssm parameters @xmath4 and the gaugino mass parameter @xmath5 by renormalization group equations @xcite : @xmath31 @xmath32 in the mssm quite generally the right selectron @xmath7 is lighter than the left selectron @xmath8 . in extended susy models these relations",
    "are changed as a consequence of additional d - terms in the scalar potential and the right selectron may be heavier than the left selectron .    in chapter 3 we study the dependence of the cross section @xmath33 and the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath34 on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we shall see that this process is useful for testing the gut - relations equs .",

    "we present numerical results for the mssm parameters @xmath35 gev , @xmath36 gev , @xmath37 gev and @xmath38 for the cms - energy @xmath39 gev .",
    "the lsp is gaugino - like with @xmath40 gev . for @xmath41 gev and @xmath42 gev",
    "this corresponds to one ecfa / desy reference scenario for the linear collider @xcite .",
    "1 shows the total cross section @xmath33 and the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath34 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this choice of @xmath28 and @xmath27 leads to a strongly marked high energetic peak in the energy spectrum @xmath20 @xcite and therefore to maximal cross sections . for the electron beam in the @xmath45 collision we choose in fig .",
    "1a , b the polarization @xmath46 . then due to @xmath47 the cross section for @xmath7",
    "is enhanced whereas that for @xmath8 is strongly suppressed so that @xmath33 is nearly independent of @xmath11 . the cross section for this polarization configuration ( fig .",
    "1a ) allows to constrain @xmath10 up to 344 gev . in a region around 200 gev the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath10 is rather weak . in this case",
    "@xmath34 ( fig .",
    "1b ) gives additional informations on the mass @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath48 gev the production of right selectrons becomes impossible and due to the suppression by the polarization factor @xmath49 the cross section is rather small : @xmath50 fb for @xmath51 gev .",
    "then @xmath34 only depends on @xmath52 and is independent of @xmath10 ( see fig .",

    "now the production and decay of left selectrons is no longer neglectible .",
    "1c gives the cross sections for three different masses @xmath54 gev , 127 gev , 200 gev .",
    "in all three cases it should be possible to constrain @xmath11 up to 170 gev .",
    "for masses larger than 170 gev the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath11 is too weak so that one obtains only a lower limit on @xmath11 . for large values of @xmath10 the measurement of the asymmetry @xmath34 ( fig .",
