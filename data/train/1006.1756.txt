    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are helium core burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes that lie at the blue end of the horizontal branch and hence are identified with the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars ( see a recent review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite showed that a high mass - loss rate on the red giant branch produces a thin hydrogen envelope and prevents the star from ascending the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the evolution of single ehb stars from zero - age to helium exhaustion may be followed on a series of tracks narrowly centred on 0.475 @xmath5@xcite .",
    "after helium exhaustion these objects evolve directly onto the white dwarf sequence .    on the other hand , following the original proposal of @xcite for the formation of sdb stars through binary evolution , it has been found that a significant fraction of these stars reside in close binary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the onset of a common envelope phase or roche lobe overflow contributes to the removal of the hydrogen envelope and directs the star toward the ehb .",
    "@xcite propose three formation channels for the formation of sdb stars through binary interaction , either involving common envelope ( ce ) phases , episodes of roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , or the merger of two helium white dwarfs .",
    "the ce scenario involving primary stars that experience a helium flash accompanied by a low - mass or white dwarf secondary star is expected to create short - period binaries ( @xmath6 to 1 ) and a final primary mass distribution narrowly centred on 0.46@xmath5 .",
    "the ce scenario with primary stars massive enough to avoid a helium flash is expected to achieve a much lower final mass for the primary ( 0.33 - 0.35 @xmath5 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the rlof scenario creates longer period binaries and a wider distribution of primary final masses .",
    "studies of the binary components , and an estimate of the frequency of such systems are required to constrain these models and determine the relative contribution of these formation channels to the sdb population .    in this context , we have initiated a program to identify new hot subdwarf candidates ( vennes et al .",
