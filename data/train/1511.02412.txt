    "we have come a long way since the work of kaluza and klein on the unification of gravity with electromagnetism obtained by attaching a fifth coordinate to the four spacetime coordinates . by enlarging the spacetime with",
    "further bosonic coordinates which , like the fifth , are ` curled up ' it is possible to attain a unified description of gravity with yang - mills theory , and the strong interactions in particular  but at the price of producing infinite towers of excitations of the ground state@xcite .",
    "one may even extend the idea with supersymmetry@xcite but at the extra price of some spin state proliferation .    in recent years",
    "we have suggested an alternative enlargement based on lorentz scalar anti - commuting coordinates , which avoids towers of excitations and spin problems .",
    "we have associated these new coordinates with concrete ` attributes ' that accompany events .",
    "the next step in our endeavour to unify gravity with the other forces involves the consideration of the strong force . as in our previous papers@xcite",
    ", we achieve this through the addition of property coordinates to space - time in order to describe the `` what '' that is missing from the `` when '' and `` where '' of an event . in the case of the strong force",
    "we need to include three ` chromicity ' coordinates , one for each colour . since the strong force conserves parity we do not need to consider separate left and right chiral property coordinates , simplifying the situation greatly .",
    "so far our work on this topic has been as follows : first@xcite we carefully worked through how to extend general relativity with anti - commuting property coordinates and then applied it to a one coordinate model , or electricity .",
    "this unified gravity with electromagnetism and also produced a cosmological constant , the sign of the which was wrong due to a lack of freedom in our metric ",
    "but this was only an issue for the one coordinate case .",
    "next@xcite we considered two property coordinates and found that we could unify gravity with a u(2 ) yang - mills gauge field , again producing a cosmological constant but this time with enough freedom that it was at least consistent with observation . to properly treat the weak force one needs to consider chiral fields , so finally@xcite we looked again at two property coordinates , but assigned them left and right chiralities .",
    "this resulted in unification of gravity with u(1)@xmath0u(1)@xmath1 gauge fields and a cosmological constant . to ensure the universality of gravitational interactions we found the gauge couplings had to be equal at high energy .",
    "the next step , which is the focus of this paper , is to consider three property coordinates associated with ` chromicity ' or colour and to attempt to unify gravity with the strong force . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we will briefly introduce property coordinates , then section [ sec3 ] covers the construction of a supermetric and the resulting lagrangian that is produced . in section [ sec4 ] we will describe how matter fields come into play and finally in section [ sec5 ] we offer some conclusions and mention what steps to take next .",
    "we attach three complex anti - commuting coordinates @xmath2 and their conjugates @xmath3 to space - time .",
    "we choose these coordinates to be lorentz scalars , which distinguishes our scheme from supersymmetry where the extra degrees of freedom transform as spinors , leading to spin state proliferation .",
    "as we have done previously , we adopt the convention that space - time - property indices run over uppercase roman characters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , etc ) , space - time indices run over lower case roman characters ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc ) and property indices run over greek letters ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc ) .",
    "thus our superspace is denoted by @xmath13 .    in our last paper@xcite",
    "we discussed left and right handed chiralities , but since the strong force conserves parity we do not need that distinction here .",
    "we assign quantum numbers to our chromic coordinates as follows : @xmath14 , colour = ( red , green , blue ) , quark number = ( 1/3 , 1/3 , 1/3 ) and similarly for the conjugates : @xmath15 , colour = ( anti - red , anti - green , anti - blue ) , quark number = ( -1/3 , -1/3 , -1/3 ) . the matter fields resulting from this assignment are discussed later in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the construction of the metric follows a very similar procedure to that of our u(2 ) paper@xcite , we start with a flat manifold possessing coordinates @xmath16 without space - time curvature or gauge fields . our metric distance in this case is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is minkowskian",
    ". the property coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 are being taken as dimensionless , so a length scale @xmath20 has been introduced to ensure the metric distance carries the correct units .",
    "we now deviate slightly from our previous work and consider the addition of the property curvature before the inclusion of gauge fields .",
    "the idea is to include u(3 ) invariants multiplied by free parameters @xmath21 ; these have no effect on the _ global _",
    "u(3 ) invariance of the metric distance . in the u(2 ) paper@xcite we had 4 free parameters , in the u(1)@xmath22u(1 ) paper@xcite we had 9 .",
    "if we continue this to the u(3 ) case we would have 6 free parameters . however all we need is the freedom to allow newton s constant and the cosmological constant to take sensible values .",
    "the restriction of these extra parameters then becomes necessary as we move forward ; we are still investigating possible ways of doing this but for now we will include one overall factor @xmath23 .",
    "thus our metric becomes :    @xmath24    we then apply the formula from our first paper@xcite to get the christoffel symbols : @xmath25[n ] } g_{ml , n }    +   g_{nl , m}- ( -1)^{[l]([m]\\!+\\![n ] ) } g_{mn , l } \\big](-1)^{[l ] } g^{lk}.\\ ] ] this is then used in the palatini form of the ricci scalar : @xmath26}g^{mk}[(-1)^{[l][m]}{\\gamma_{kl}}^n{\\gamma_{nm}}^l                  - { \\gamma_{km}}^n{\\gamma_{nl}}^l]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to produce the lagrangian ( via mathematica ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the inclusion of the property curvature factor @xmath29 has thus generated a cosmological constant .",
    "the next step is to introduce space - time curvature by generalizing from @xmath30 to @xmath31 and also to admit local u(3 ) phase transformations to our chromic coordinates so as to incorporate qcd ; these transformations of chromicity take the form : @xmath32^{\\mu\\bar\\nu } \\zeta^\\nu ; \\;\\;\\ ; \\zeta^{\\bar\\mu } \\rightarrow \\zeta^{\\bar\\nu } [ e^{-i \\theta(x)}]^{\\nu\\bar\\mu}.\\ ] ] for our metric to transform correctly under such local phase transformations the minimal way is to introduce non - abelian gluon fields @xmath33 , leading to the following metric : @xmath34 there are two reasons for the choice of metric in the spacetime - property sector : we have to ensure that it is overall fermionic and incorporates carriers of property , namely the gauge fields .",
    "one could contemplate including in that sector ghost fields @xmath35 with the wrong spin - statistics multiplying polynomials of @xmath36 , but these have no place at the semiclassical level and it is hard to see where they fit in at this stage ; however they may have a role to play when quantizing gravity via brst@xcite , but @xmath35 most certainly should _ not _ appear as asymptotic states ; similar remarks can be made for the scalar ghosts@xcite helpful in quantizing gauge models .    making use of mathematica , the lagrangian arising from ( 6 ) then comes out to be : @xmath37 } -\\left(2c_2 - 3c_1{}^2\\right ) g_w{}^2 \\mathcal{f}^{mn } \\mathcal{f}_{mn }   - \\frac{288}{l^4}k_\\lambda \\bigg)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 .",
    "this gives : @xmath40 even with this fairly minimal set of @xmath21 coefficients , there is easily enough freedom to fix the gravitational and cosmological constants to be what they physically are , though the smallness of @xmath41 implies fine - tuning .",
    "focussing on the three chromic @xmath2 , we are dealing with an sp(6 ) group that contains u(3)@xmath42 su(3)@xmath43 .",
    "if there are no powers of @xmath2 or @xmath44 , we are dealing with a black or colourless object , whereas the coefficient of the cubic term @xmath45 corresponds to a white system ( or baryon ) ; this is to be contrasted with the colour neutral combination @xmath46 ( a meson ) .",
    "however from the point of view of the colour group , we can make use of the levi - civita tensor @xmath47 and its conjugate to contract / raise / lower chromic indices ; as far as su(3 ) colour is concerned white is the same as black and all free hadrons have this property , but chromicity regards them differently .",
    "nonetheless the basic polynomials @xmath48 with @xmath49 , which have already been used in introducing property curvature previously , are both colour and chromicity neutral and have the potential of describing ` generations ' of singlets .      to investigate this notion systematically ,",
    "start with the linear in @xmath2 colour or chromic triplet @xmath50 which belongs to the superfermion field @xmath51 .",
    "next consider the quadratic combination @xmath52  part of a bosonic superfield @xmath53  corresponding to the colour product : @xmath54 , of which the @xmath55 is missing because of anticommutativity !",
    "next add one power of @xmath44 , leading to @xmath56 . here",
    "both representations are permitted ; the new triplet can be written as @xmath57 while the new sextet contains @xmath58 , etc .",
    "we can envisage another fermionic triplet through the polynomial @xmath59 having components @xmath60 so far as bosons are concerned , in addition to the colour singlets and octets , contained in the combinations , @xmath61 , there are only two colour triplets : @xmath62 plus their conjugates .    to summarise all these facts",
    ", it serves to draw up a table of 32 component fields each arising in the property expansions of the superfields containing fermions and bosons : @xmath63 these components , labelled by @xmath64 , can be arranged in a 4@xmath224 magic square where entries ( as colour representations ) tie in with the powers of chromicity .",
    "thus we get the fermion ( see table  [ ta1 ] ) and boson ( see table  [ ta2 ] ) squares below :    observe that reflection about the main diagonal is connected with charge conjugation , whereas reflection about the cross - diagonal @xmath65 does not affect the colour representation .",
    "we may take advantage of the last observation to cut down the number of independent components arising in the property expansion . for a start",
    "let the duality@xmath66 operation correspond to reflection about the cross - diagonal of the monomials : @xmath67 . specifically , using the colour levi - civita symbol , we construct for example , @xmath68 .",
    "thus @xmath69 is colour selfdual , while @xmath70 and vice versa .",
    "so if we were to impose anti - selfduality on the magic square we would remain with two colour triplets ( & conjugates ) in the fermion sectors ( see table  [ ta3 ] ) , with the colour sextet disappearing ; the boson sector ( see table  [ ta4 ] ) would comprise two singlets , one octet and one triplet ( + conjugate ) :    the corresponding anti - selfdual ( normalized ) chromic expansions read , in detail ( @xmath49 ) : @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 note also that both @xmath51 and @xmath53 are overall bose but @xmath51 carries spinorial indices @xmath74 and that both left and right fermion fields occur in the magic square ; so we are dealing with dirac fields . the salient points to stress after all these manoeuvres",
    "is that two fermion generations ( each with three colours of fermions ) survive the antiduality constraint , while there are two scalar colour singlets @xmath75 .",
    "the aim here is to show that the interactions with the gluons arise automatically from the supermetric @xmath76 or frame vectors @xmath77 in the spacetime - chromicity sector ( as listed in appendix a.3 ) through the full free lagrangian @xmath78 , where @xmath79\\quad{\\rm and}\\ ] ] @xmath80\\psi.\\ ] ]    to simplify the discussion we shall at first ignore the property and spatial curvatures , thereby setting all @xmath81 , but will retain the gauge fields components of the metric to check that the correct gluon interactions ensue .",
    "( later on we will relax this restriction as it can potentially complicate the picture by producing intergenerational mixing and finite wave function renormalization effects . )",
    "the normalization factors have been correctly introduced in ( 10)-(12 ) in as much as @xmath82    the bose field integration gives for the kinetic term @xmath83)(\\partial_m\\phi'-ig_w[w_m,\\phi'])\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the fermi field produces @xmath84 provided that @xmath51 is a singlet in the auxiliary property gamma - matrix space , as explained in ref .",
    "2 ; this ensures that the only relevant derivative part of ( 13 ) is @xmath85 , with @xmath86 giving zero .",
    "that is all well and good .",
    "however an interesting byproduct of the analysis is that the property derivative contributions , 2@xmath87 , will add to the masses by planckian magnitudes @xmath88.\\ ] ] at this stage we are unclear if this is a desirable feature or not , but we need to be reminded that there is also an unrenormalized bare mass term @xmath89 which can serve to cancel out the planckian additions ; besides we have disregarded the self - interactions such as @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "it is quite straightforward to introduce the space - time curvature via the full frame vectors ( not just the gauge field part ) as per eq ( a.2 ) : @xmath92 or the full metric ( 6 ) . including the property curvature coefficients @xmath21",
    ", the berezinian ( @xmath93 ) reads : @xmath94.\\ ] ] finally one must integrate over the property coordinates .",
    "the result of including space - time curvature is to produce a fully coordinconfident ate independent and gauge invariant lagrangian unifying gravity and qcd .",
    "the only complication which arises is that the component fields , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , may undergo wave function renormalizations determined by the property curvature coefficients @xmath21 .",
    "for instance , noting that the spatial derivatives and the gauge field interactions are equally affected , the fermion field @xmath95 must be rescaled by the factor @xmath97 $ ] , while the other fermion colour triplet @xmath98 does not require any rescaling .",
    "( similar remarks apply to some of the boson field components . )",
    "we see that it is a fairly simple matter to extend our formalism from our previous papers to the strong force .",
    "further , by including an overall gauge invariant factor @xmath29 multiplying our metric , we can generate a cosmological constant .",
    "then considering a local su(3 ) gauge transformation of our property coordinates we end up producing an su(3 ) yang - mills term in our lagrangian .",
    "together this unifies gravity with the strong force , as well as allowing for an unrestricted cosmological constant .",
    "as well , it automatically generates the correct interactions of matter fields with gluons .",
    "the next step in our program is to consider larger gauge groups , for instance u(1)@xmath22su(3 ) for dealing with electromagnetism plus the strong force , followed by considerations of chirality to deal with the weak force .",
    "the restriction of the free parameters @xmath21 is also worth further study ; in this paper we have confined ourselves to an overall factor @xmath29 multiplying the metric but there are likely to be other ways of limiting the extra degrees of freedom in the metric .",
    "we have been encountering issues with the time taken for algebraic computations , as the computational complexity is factorial in the number of property coordinates .",
    "this can be addressed by developing better algorithms to simplify expressions involving the metric or through further analysis of the underlying mathematical structure to allow us to compute the lagrangian in a simpler manner .",
    "as we are now confident our scheme is self consistent and frame invariant , we can take shortcuts in our calculations to determine the cosmological and gravitational constants .",
    "the ultimate goal of all this is to eventually unify gravity with the full standard model group of u(1)@xmath22 su(2)@xmath0su(3 ) , with enough restrictions on our free parameters @xmath21 to be able to predict the value of the cosmological constant , or at least to be consistent with observations while maintaining a minimal number of free parameters .",
    "in the evaluation of the lagrangian we come across expressions of the form : @xmath99 which will produce various traces over the matrices @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 when the property integration is performed .",
    "we now set about determining how to evaluate these expressions for @xmath5 property coordinates .",
    "first , if we sum over @xmath5 property indices @xmath103 , the following is true : @xmath104 where we take @xmath105 .",
    "this means that if we have some expression of the form : @xmath106 we can permute this to : @xmath107 where ( sign ) = @xmath108 for @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 ( + 1 when @xmath5 mod 4 = 0 or 1 , otherwise @xmath110 ) .",
    "we now rewrite this in terms of levi - civita symbols : @xmath112 this product of levi - civita symbols can be re - expressed as a matrix determinant , @xmath113 thus we can find the results of integration over property coordinates for our non - abelian matrices @xmath114 .",
    "we now test this on su(2 ) , which we know already via explicit expansion to be : @xmath115 using our above method , we have a minus sign since @xmath116 , and then we need the determinant : @xmath117 thus our expression becomes : @xmath118 after integration over property , which agrees with above .",
    "we can now apply the same process to su(3 ) traces .",
    "we will start in the permuted order , as this is what mathematica deals with ( i.e. no sign due to permutation ) .",
    "@xmath119 we need the determinant : @xmath120 thus after integration over property our expression becomes : @xmath121 for the purposes of mathematica implementation there are several important subcases , namely when @xmath100 , @xmath101 or @xmath102 are the identity . in this case",
    "their traces evaluate for @xmath122 : for @xmath123 we get @xmath124 ; for @xmath125 we get @xmath126 , and finally for @xmath127 we get 6 .",
    "we have the overall curvature factor @xmath128 , leading to @xmath129 in section 4 we have taken upper - triangular frame vectors of the following form which produce the metric ( 6 ) used previously : @xmath130 these have as their inverse the vielbein matrix , @xmath131    99 y.m .",
