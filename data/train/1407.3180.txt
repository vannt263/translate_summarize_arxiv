    "the analysis of series of rankings has a vast tradition in the literature ( see , e.g.  @xcite for a review on applications ) and in recent years has attracted the interest of big companies that handle massive amount of data on the internet .",
    "one of the most studied issues is the computation of a consensus ( or aggregated ) ranking that best summarizes a series of rankings .",
    "a typical application of that approach is the set of web pages shown following a user query on a web searcher @xcite .",
    "the studies interested in obtaining a consensus ranking often define a distance ( see  @xcite ) to properly define their goal : that is , a ranking that minimizes such a distance .",
    "one of the seminal works dealing with distances in rankings can be found in chapter ii of  @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding a ranking that minimizes the distance to a series of rankings , sometimes called kemeny optimal aggregation problem  @xcite , is np - hard ( for @xmath1 rankings or more ) but some approximation techniques exist , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful approaches to measure the distance between two rankings is based upon the number of permutations , or crossings , that occur when passing from one ranking to the other .",
    "the study of permutations in series of rankings has a long history and its origin can be situated around the 40 s in the works of kendall  @xcite .",
    "the kendall s @xmath2 correlation coefficient , a measure of the number of pairs of elements that flip their positions , has been extensively used .",
    "for example , in the 70 s , kendall s coefficient ( including the treatment of ranking with ties ) was used to compare political alliances among states ; see references in  @xcite .",
    "kendall s @xmath2 can be computed in @xmath3 time , being @xmath4 the number of elements to rank  @xcite .    when applied to web search ,",
    "it is usually sufficient to worry about the top - k elements  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the rest of the @xmath5 elements can be supposed to be tied .",
    "the treatment of ties when comparing rankings has an intrinsic importance and it is one of our main focus in this paper . sometimes in the literature , for example in  @xcite ,",
    "rankings with ties are called _ partial rankings_. this kind of rankings ( rankings with ties ) arises naturally in many applications : for example , when users @xmath6 score the service offered by some hotels ( @xmath7 ) on a scale of 1 to 5 there can be a user that assign the same score to different hotels , producing a tie in that ranking .",
    "some variations of kendall s @xmath2 , including treatment of ties , have been proposed .",
    "for example , in  @xcite the authors focus on some problems arisen on information retrieval applications ; in  @xcite the authors analyse the treatment of ties and show some problems in the original treatment of kendall ; in  @xcite the authors show different alternatives to weight a crossing depending on the initial and/or final position of the swapped elements ; in  @xcite the authors show the equivalence of some metrics , and set up an appropriate framework to extend kendall s @xmath2 to the case of partial rankings , by defining a _ kendall distance with penalty parameter @xmath8_.    in the field of graphs the topic of counting crossings is known as permutation graphs ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . the theoretical definition of a graph that shows successive permutations can be situated , as far as we know , in the work of  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the crossings that occur between successive rankings when these rankings show ties . as a starting point",
    "we use the method presented in @xcite based on measures of complex networks , such as mean strength and mean degree . in this paper",
    "we extend this technique to partial rankings and we make use of multiplex networks @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , to achieve that goal .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : def ] we give the basic definitions about scores and rankings with ties . in section  [ sec : network ]",
    "we motivate our approach based on multiplex networks and we extend the concept of _ kendall distance with penalty parameter @xmath8 _ of  @xcite to the case of a series of partial rankings .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : economy ] we show an application to analyse the competitiveness of ibex index from 2003 to 2013 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is analysing series of rankings with ties by using complex networks , and therefore we start this section giving the basic definitions about rankings ( with and without ties ) , scores and competitivity graphs . roughly speaking a _ ranking _ ( with or without ties ) of a finite set of elements @xmath9 is an _ ordering _ of the elements of @xmath10 with or without ties between elements . from a mathematical point of view , this idea can be rewritten in the following way :    given a finite set @xmath9 a _ ranking @xmath11 ( without ties ) _ of @xmath10 is a total order @xmath12 on @xmath10 , i.e. it is a binary relationship on @xmath10 such that    * @xmath12 is _ reflexive _ , i.e. , @xmath13 for every @xmath14 , * @xmath12 is _ antisymmetric _ , i.e. if @xmath15 and @xmath16 , then @xmath17 , * @xmath12 is _ transitive _ , i.e. if @xmath15 and @xmath18 , then @xmath19 , * @xmath12 is _ total _ , i.e. if @xmath20 , then either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "[ rem : biyeccion ] in other references of the literature , a _ ranking @xmath11 ( without ties ) _ of @xmath10 is defined as a bijection @xmath21 , since any bijection @xmath11 defines a binary relationship @xmath12 on @xmath10 given by @xmath15 if and only if @xmath22 that it is straightforward to check that it is a total order on @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , it can be proved that if @xmath12 is a total order on @xmath10 , a bijection @xmath23 can be defined such that @xmath24 if and only if @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , a _ ranking @xmath11 ( without ties ) _ of @xmath10 can be defined as any injective function @xmath25 , as we will point out later when we remind the concept of score .",
    "note that if we take a ranking without ties , if we consider @xmath20 , then either @xmath15 or @xmath16 , and therefore , if @xmath26 , they are always ranked differently .",
    "this fact is not always possible in real cases , since , for example , two teams can be tied in a competition or two web pages could have the same pagerank and therefore we should also consider rankings with ties , as the following definition shows .",

    "if @xmath11 is a ranking with ties , and we have two different elements @xmath20 , we say that @xmath27 and @xmath28 _ are tied _ if @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "the ranking is the _ qualitative _ version of an ordering while the corresponding score is the _ quantitative _ version of it , but in many real - life applications it is enough considering the qualitative version , i.e. the ranking itself .",
    "note that @xmath11 is a ranking without ties if and only if the score @xmath30 is injective , as we pointed out in remark  [ rem : biyeccion ] and since the fact that two different elements @xmath20 are tied ( with respect to @xmath34 ) if and only if @xmath35 .",
    "this fact makes that the existence of ties in many real - life rankings can be very unstable : if the raking is given by an empirical score with non - integer values , the ties could disappear by round - off errors .",
    "in order to avoid this problem , we suggest considering _ approximated ties _",

    "in the sequel , we always construct ranking with ( approximated ) ties associated to a score @xmath30 and a precision threshold @xmath49 and we simply call it simply _ ranking with ties associated to the score @xmath30 and with precision threshold @xmath49_.    [ ex:5scores ] let us consider the following @xmath59 scores of elements @xmath60 given by the columns of table  [ ta : scores ] .    @xmath61    if we consider the precision threshold @xmath62 , then the rankings with ( approximated ) ties associated to the scores @xmath63 is given in table  [ ta : rankings ]",

    "there are several ways of extending this notion to families of rankings with ties , but in the next section , we will see how to define the _ multiplex ( evolutive ) competitivity network _ , which is the natural extension of competitivity graphs that helps to analyse properties of families of rankings with ties .",
    "in this section we introduce a multiplex network associated to a family of rankings , some of them with ties among its nodes .",
    "we extend the notion of kendall distance with penalty and show that can also be computed by considering the associated projected multiplex network .",
    "moreover , we relate the classical notion of normalized mean strength of such network with the extension of the kendall distance .      in this subsection",
    "we introduce the notion of multiplex evolutive competitivity network associated to a family of rankings with ties , extending the previous notion of @xcite defined for rankings with no ties .",

    "enough_. in order to estimate the risk of an investment , some parameters may be considered .",
    "the simplest is the range of the share prices considered along a period of time , i.e. , the difference between the greatest and the smallest value during that period of time .",
    "another usual parameters are the variance and the standard deviation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that although the most commonly used concept to estimate the risk of an investment is the variance , many academics prefer to use the standard deviation since it offers advantages with respect to the number of decimals we have to employ @xcite .",
    "for example , we prefer say that a stock share has an annual performance of @xmath155 per cent instead of saying that it has a variance of @xmath156 . for this reason ,",
    "we have employed the standard deviation instead of the variance in our analysis as the risk indicator .",
    "specifically , the ( annualised ) daily volatility @xmath157 has been calculated according to the formula @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the number or trading days from day @xmath27 ( of the year @xmath86 ) to the same day of the previous year ( @xmath160 ) , @xmath161 are the daily return of all the days trading days from day @xmath27 ( of the year @xmath86 ) to the same day of the previous year ( @xmath160 ) and @xmath162 is the mean of these values ( also called _ annualized moving average of the daily return _ at day @xmath27 ) .",
    "it is known that financial market is a chaotic system in the sense that it is sensitive to initial conditions and gives rise to effectively unpredictable long - term behaviour @xcite . a possible reason for this development may be that it contains positive feedback ( which tends to amplify trends over time ) and negative feedback ( which tends to reduce trends over time ) . however , some attempts to detect the presence of chaos in certain systems have not had any success .",
    "for example , in  @xcite the authors tested for the presence of chaos in the ftse 100 index using a six month sample of about 60,000 minute by - minute returns and found little to support the view that the process is chaotic at any frequency .",
    "a question to investigate is the evidence of chaos in the evolution of some other parameters related to the stock markets which give information about the stock of the different companies .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of competitivity for the daily values of return and volatility for the twenty - five considered stocks in the ibex 35 during the period 2003 - 2013 .",
    "the analysis is based on the study of global ( structural ) properties of the corresponding competitivity networks .",
    "as the theoretical framework established in previous sections differs from those traditionally used in the analysis of stock markets , the information we get is completely different from that obtained through a traditional analysis , since we have analysed the ranking fluctuations of the stock values rather than the actual values . in particular",
    ", we have considered the evolution of the normalized mean strength ( @xmath163 ) for the competitivity networks obtained from return and volatility during the period 2003 - 2013 , but many other structural , global or local , parameters could be considered as it happened in @xcite .",
    "@xmath163 is a good indicator of the number of fluctuations in the daily rankings , since by using proposition  [ prop_ns - cev ] , the higher @xmath163 is the more fluctuations in the rankings of return or volatility we get .",
    "furthermore , since a high number of fluctuations in the daily rankings of return or volatility can be economically understood as uncertainty in the investment strategies or non - preconditioned markets , @xmath163 could be considered as a quantitative indicator of such economical variables .",
    "once we have fixed the economical dataset to be analysed ( in this case the ranking fluctuations of the return and volatility of the common twenty - five companies that have been trading on the spanish stock market contributing to this stock market ibex35 index during the whole period 2003 - 2013 ) , the rankings to be considered must be fixed .",
    "note that the rankings are given by the return or the volatility and therefore they are actually rankings with ties .",
    "furthermore , these ties must be also considered as _ approximated ties _ as we introduced in definition  [ def : aprox ] .",
    "note that either return and volatility are non - integer scores and therefore the use of approximated ties helps avoiding the instability of ties due to round - off errors .",
    "in addition to this , some stock markets values which are very similar ( but different ) could be considered equivalent for an investor , and therefore they are _",
    "approximately tied_.    in order to fix the setting of the analysis the precision threshold @xmath49 must be stated .",
    "the right choice of @xmath49 should consider the coexistence of tied and non - tied nodes , since a very low value of @xmath49 produces unstable results due to round - off errors , while a very high value of @xmath49 forces to all the nodes to be tied and therefore produce a rough analysis .",
    "the trade - off between number of ties , accuracy and stability of the analysis is obtained for values of @xmath49 that produce a significant but not too high number of ties .",

    "note that either for very high or for very low values of @xmath49 , we get that @xmath168 , as it is shown in figure  [ figfn1 ] .",

    "note that the multiplex behaviour of the multiplex competitivity graphs obtained from the ranking of the return and volatility are different , exhibiting these differences in multiplex properties .",
    "the classic idea of comparing rankings by using the number of crossings -or permutations- that occur when going from one ranking to the other , can be straightforward extended to compare series of several rankings when one focus on pairs of consecutive rankings .",
    "this work was already done in  @xcite by introducing a tool from complex networks : the so - called _ competitivity graph_. in this paper , we have extended this procedure for the case when ties are allowed in each ranking .",
    "given that the treatment of ties in rankings has a long tradition in the literature we have adopted ( and extended ) the procedures defined in  @xcite to compute kendall s distance between rankings when ties are presented .",
    "we have used the technique of multiplex networks and we have considered the crossings distinguishing when the crossing occurs between adjacent rankings ( we take account of this on layer 1 , or crossing layer ) , when the crossing is a change from tied to untied or vice versa ( layer 2 , or semi - crossing layer ) , when the crossing occurs after a period of consecutive ties ( layer 3 , or long - term crossing ) and when there are a situation of tie among two elements in two consecutive rankings ( layer 4 , or tie layer ) see figure  [ figrent2013 ] .",
    "we have denoted this network as the multiplex evolutive competitivity network associated to a family of rankings with ties .",
    "we have also contributed with two theoretical issues . on the one hand",
    ", we have introduced a technique to convert a family of scores ( or ratings ) to a family of rankings by introducing the concept of approximated ties : that is , a way to define a tie when two elements have a score close enough depending on a certain threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown theoretical results relating our concept of normalized mean strength ( @xmath163 ) with the corresponding background concept of evolutive kendall s distance .",
    "as an application of the introduced concepts we have shown an analysis of the spanish stock market for 25 values during the period 2003 - 2013 .",
    "the main conclusions of this analysis are the following :    * since the number of crossings depends on the number -and the type- of ties presented in the rankings , the first step in an analysis of a series of scores is to study how the variations in the threshold for ties ( that we denote @xmath49 ) affects the number of ties ( see figure  [ figtiesall ] ) . by using the data of return for year 2003 we have shown ( see figure  [ figfn1 ] ) that our treatment of crossings is equivalent to the model of  @xcite in the two limit cases : when no ties are present ( that is , for small values of @xmath49 ) or when all the elements are tied ( that is , when @xmath49 is very large ) .",
    "* during the period 2003 - 2013 the maximum competitivity regarding the return values corresponded to year 2004 ( see figure  [ figevolnsvsyears ] and figure  [ figevolnseachyears ] , for @xmath165 or @xmath182 , where there are not too many ties ) .",
    "that is , a year that corresponded to a growing period of the spanish stock market , presented a lot of crossings between the values of the companies .",
    "in fact , such number of crossings ( @xmath183 at the end of the year , for @xmath165 ) has not reached yet , not even in the year 2013 that was also a growing period but with a level of crossings of @xmath184 . therefore we conclude that the competitivity level ( as measured by @xmath163 ) of 2004 has not been reached yet .",
    "* we have shown that although the values of the return may show a great variation ( for example see figure  [ fig2004 ] ) the competitivity may rest invariant or with minimal changes : that is , stock values may go up and down preserving the number of crossings between their values : they go up and down maintaining the level of competitivity of the whole system .",
    "that is why we say that our information gives a different information than the usual one . * regarding volatility",
    ", that is a measure of the dispersion of the stock along a year , we recall that a crossing in volatility means that stocks more volatile than other become less volatile and vice versa . in year 2004",
    "( figure  [ fig2004 ] , down right ) we see that the crossings in volatility tend to decrease , while the values of volatility decrease ( figure  [ fig2004 ] up right ) . in the year 2008",
    "( a crisis year ) volatility was growing up ( figure  [ fig2008 ] up right ) while the crossings in volatility grew up from days around 40 to 60 in that year ( reaching values of @xmath163 around 0.014 such as in 2004 ) and then the crossings fall down to values of @xmath163 around 0.008 such as the values of 2004 .",
    "therefore we see that two years with different trend in volatility show the same trend in @xmath163 .",
    "observing figure  [ fig2013 ] down right , we see that in the year 2013 the volatility was decreasing while the @xmath163 was slowly growing up but without reaching the values of the year 2004 .",

    ", could be studied for the ( multiplex ) networks associated to series of rankings with ties , and extract conclusions about the rankings themselves .",
    "the introduction of multiplex nature in the analysis of rankings with ties , enables the use of multiplex - native measures and techniques , such as inter - layer correlations , that could be considered in the future .",
    "let us illustrate this with an example : imagine a group of cyclists going up to the top of a hill .",
    "they can go up in an ordered way , with no interchange in their relative positions or they can go up in a turbulent way changing their positions so that the head of the group is occupied by different cyclists as long as they climb the hill .",
    "now imagine that each cyclist is a stock value and the group is composed of 25 values that are going up or down during a year .",
    "our measure of competitiveness @xmath163 gives an idea of the turbulences in this process of going up or down .",
    "if @xmath163 is high it means that the group moves in a disordered way , crossing their positions .",
    "when @xmath163 is low it means that the movement is made with small changes in the relative positions .",
    "we think it could be interesting to analyse if there are subgroups of stocks ( or _ communities _ in the language of complex network analysis ) that move together in these crossings .",
    "it would be useful to analyse the crossings of each individual stock with respect to the others and could help analysing the optimal composition of an investment portfolio and studies about investment funds .",
