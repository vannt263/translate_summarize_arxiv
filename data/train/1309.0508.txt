    "understanding the dispersal of protoplanetary discs remains a key problem in star and planet formation .",
    "in particular , the time at which the disc disperses sets the time in which ( gas ) planets must form . additionally , the method and time - scale on which disc clearing operates strongly influences the dust and gas physics in the disc , as well as the evolution of currently forming planets .",
    "observationally , optically thick primordial discs are known to survive for several myr before being dispersed in both dust ( haisch et al .",
    "2001 ; hernandez et al .",
    "2007 ; mamajek 2009 ) and gas ( kennedy & kenyon 2009 ) , leaving behind a pre - main sequence star possibly surrounded by an optically thin debris disk , containing second generation dust particles ( wyatt 2008 ) .",
    "a small fraction of young stars show evidence for a cleared gap or hole in their dust discs , indicated by a lack of opacity at nir wavelengths , but values comparable with an optically thick disc at mir wavelengths .",
    "these ` transition ' discs ( strom et al . 1989 ; sturski et al . 1990 ; calvet et al . 2002 ) have been interpreted as discs caught at a stage which is intermediate between disc bearing and disc - less .",
    "furthermore , the lack of objects observed in regions of parameter space that represent discs that are no longer optically thick at ir wavelengths indicates that the time - scale for disc dispersal is short compared to the disc s lifetime ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) .",
    "comparing the ratio of observed transition discs to primordial discs indicates that the clearing time - scale for the inner disc in roughly 10% of the disc s lifetime ( luhman et al .",
    "2010 ; ercolano et al . 2011 ; koepferl et al .",
    "furthermore , the lack of objects which show no nir or mir excess but show excesses at fir or sub - mm / mm wavelengths ( duvert et al . 2000 ; andrews & williams 2005;2007 ; cieza et al .",
    "2013 ) indicate that this inner disc clearing is correlated with outer disc clearing .    while ` transition ' discs have several possible origins such as grain growth ( dullemond & dominik 2005 ; birnstiel et al .",
    "2012 ) , tidal truncations by planets ( calvet et al . 2005 ; rice et al . 2006 ; zhu et al .",
    "2012 , clarke & owen 2013 ) or photoevaporation ( clarke et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is planet formation ( armitage & hansen 1999 ) or photoevaporation that offer the best scenarios for disc dispersal . while no qualitative or quantitative predictions can be made about how planet formation clears the disc , one would assume it slows as it proceeds through the disc due to the longer planet formation time and large mass - reservoir to remove .",
    "photoevaportion driven by x - rays from the central star can explain a large fraction of the observed transition discs ( owen et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) but not the full sample ; in particular transition discs with large holes and high accretion rates ( espaillat et al . 2010",
    "; andrews et al .",
    "2011 ) are inconsistent with a photoevaporative origin .",
    "however , this category of ` transition ' disc may have a different origin and not even be associated with the disc clearing process at all ( owen & clarke 2012 ; clarke & owen 2013 ; nayakshin 2013 ) being instead perhaps a relatively rare but long - lived phenomenon .",
    "photoevaporation can explain the population of observed transition discs with small holes ( @xmath2 au ) and modest accretion rates ( @xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "however , the same model predicts a comparable sample of non - accreting transition discs with large holes ; termed ` relic discs ' by owen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and a similar population may be expected if planet formation is the dominant dispersal mechanism . while the exact population of transition discs with large holes is yet to be quantified , the lack of weak t tauri stars ( wtts ) with sub - mm detections ( duvert et al .",
    "2000 ; andrews & williams 2005;2007 , mathews et al . 2012 ) or _ herschel _ detections ( cieza et al . 2013 ) is inconsistent with a sizeable ( comparable to the population of ` transition ' discs ) population of relic discs .",
    "the 1d viscous calculation of disc dispersal typically employed in disc evolution calculations ( clarke et al .",
    "2001 ; alexander et al .",
    "2006 ; alexander & armitage 2009 ; owen et al .",
    "2010,2011 ) neglect the fact that the disc may be unstable to dynamical clearing , where the disc s mid - plane can be entirely penetrated by the x - rays .",
    "owen et al . ( 2012 ) presented simulations of a process they termed ` thermal sweeping ' whereby a disc with an optically thin inner hole is dynamically cleared ( on a time - scale @xmath6 years ) once the surface density at the disc s inner edge falls to a sufficiently low value . in the low mass discs simulated by owen et al , this process set in at radii @xmath7 au .",
    "owen et al . ( 2012 ) argued that this process prevents the production of a long - lived population of low mass discs with large cavities ( ` relic discs ' ) and that it shifts the predicted populations of transition discs created through photoevaporation to those dominated by small holes and low accretion rates .",
    "in addition , owen et al . (",
    "2012 ) presented a back of the envelope calculation to estimate the surface density @xmath8 at which thermal sweeping begins ; however , such a calculation was only compared to two multi - dimension radiation hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "a parameter span using multi - dimensional calculations is not currently computationally feasible .",
    "thus , in this paper , we build on the framework for thermal sweeping outlined in owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in order to determine the critical surface density for thermal sweeping to proceed by performing a large set of 1d radiation - hydrodynamic calculations . in section  2 we describe the thermal sweeping mechanism and summarise the back of the envelope calculation performed by owen et al .",
    "section  3 outlines the numerical method used for suite of 1d radiation hydrodynamic calculations and present our findings in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we discuss the implications for thermal sweeping on disc evolution and discuss an improved model for determining the critical density at which thermal sweeping proceeds and finally in section  6 we summarise our findings .",
    "in this section we describe the theoretical basis for how x - ray irradiation of a disc with an inner hole leads to rapid , dynamical disc dispersal .",
    "we also present the back of the envelope calculation presented by owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) as well as pointing out the assumptions that may break down .      in order to explain the origin of thermal sweeping , we show in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] a schematic depiction of the flow structure that results from x - ray irradiation of a disc with an inner hole , based on the simulations of owen et al .",
    "( 2010,2011,2012 ) .        the x - rays heat up the inner disc and drive a sub - sonic wind radially inwards .",
    "the simulations of owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that the gas becomes significantly decelerated by centrifugal effects at a radius of roughly @xmath9 and at this point is deflected vertically by pressure gradients , attaining a sonic transition at a height @xmath10 .",
    "owen et al ( 2012 ) showed that the mass flux in the wind is set at the sonic point and that the structure of the radially inflowing thermal wind region ( see figure 1 ) can be understood in terms of a one - dimensional , angular momentum conserving flow subject to this boundary condition on the mass flux . the total radial column density in this thermal wind region is given by :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the column , @xmath13 is the number density , @xmath14 the mass - loss rate , @xmath15 the mean particle mass , @xmath16 the gas velocity and @xmath17 the scale height .",
    "this is significantly lower than the column required to absorb the x - rays ( @xmath18 @xmath19 - ercolano et al .",
    "2008;2009 ) .",
    "thus , in this flow topology the material that dominates the absorption of the x - rays is not actually in the thermal wind , but is still bound to the disc , essentially in hydrostatic equilibrium with temperatures @xmath20 k.    owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) argued that for this bound x - ray heated region to remain in dynamical equilibrium it must have a radial pressure scale ( @xmath21 ) smaller than its vertical pressure scale ( @xmath22 ) . since in order to obtain dynamical equilibrium , the disc must be able to adjust itself radially to changes in the vertical structure on a time - scale considerably shorter than the dynamical time - scale of the disc @xmath23 . in situations",
    "where @xmath24 ( and where the time - scales for attaining equilibrium in the radial and vertical directions are comparable ) , this bound x - ray heated region is unstable to progressive penetration by the x - rays as follows . in the case of a small vertical expansion of the flow , the disc can not re - gain equilibrium in the radial direction on the vertical expansion time - scale and",
    "so the radial column density at the mid - plane ( and the local volume density ) are reduced .",
    "consequently , the temperature of the x - ray heated flow rises and the vertical expansion is accelerated . the further reduction in mid - plane column density results in further penetration of the x - rays and the process of _ vertical _ evacuation of the disc",
    "is repeated for a fresh layer of previously unheated disc material .",
    "the key difference between this behaviour and ` normal ' photoevaporative clearing from a holed disc is that vertical expansion leads to runaway heating of the disc inner rim .",
    "here we repeat the simple analytical argument presented by owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , but emphasise the assumptions made in its derivation . since the x - ray bound heated region must be in approximate pressure equilibrium with the passively heated ( by dust ) disc at large radii one can write : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath27 & @xmath28 is the number density and temperature in the bound x - ray heated region and @xmath29 is the gas pressure in the passively heated disc .",
    "writing @xmath30 as approximately @xmath31 , and using the fact that thermal sweeping begins when @xmath32 , we can recast equation  [ eqn : disc_pressure ] in terms as a criterion for thermal sweeping as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radial column density corresponding to complete absorption of the x - rays ( @xmath35 @xmath19 ) . in the case of a disc in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium",
    "this can be re - cast in terms of a critical surface density for the inner rim of the dust - heated disc : @xmath36 given @xmath37 , this resulted in a weak @xmath38 scaling for the critical surface density with radius , with no explicit dependence on stellar mass or x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , this derivation presented by owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) makes two strong assumptions : i ) that the bound x - ray heated region always represents a column density of @xmath39 @xmath19 ; ii ) the surface density at the transition between the x - ray heated disc and passively heated disc is representative of the peak surface density of the disc s profile .",
    "assumption i ) may break down if the gas density is so high that x - ray heating is insufficient to heat the gas above the dust temperature even if it is optically thin to the x - rays .",
    "this typically occurs at ionization parameters @xmath40 erg cm s@xmath5 ( where @xmath41 ) . in the case that the boundary of the x - ray heated region is set by the criterion @xmath42 , we can estimate the column density in the bound x - ray heated region as @xmath43 . at the point of onset of thermal sweeping this",
    "can be written @xmath44 which ( from the definition of the ionization parameter ) becomes : @xmath45 therefore , since we expect thermal sweeping to take place when the hole radius is large ( @xmath46 au ) , then we need to consider cases where the total column density in the bound x - ray heated region is @xmath47 @xmath19 .",
    "this means that equation  [ eqn : o12_crit ] will not represent how the critical surface density for thermal sweeping varies in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "in particular , if the criterion in some regions of parameter space is set by a minimum ionization parameter rather than total column density then it should depend on the x - ray luminosity as well as inner hole radius .    in this paper",
    "we assume without further discussion that @xmath32 is a necessary and sufficient condition for initiating thermal sweeping ( an assumption that we will revisit in future two - dimensional studies motivated by the results of the present paper . ) here we use 1d radiation - hydrodynamic models to perform a parameter space study , calculating how the critical surface density ( @xmath8 - defined as the peak surface density at the inner edge of the dust - heated disc for which @xmath32 ) varies with stellar mass , x - ray luminosity and inner hole radius .",
    "the advantage of a one - dimensional treatment is that it is possible to perform a large suite of high resolution simulations that are beyond the scope of 2d simulations and that can inform the choice of parameters and resolution requirements of future 2d studies .",
    "the justification for a one dimensional treatment is that - prior to the onset of thermal sweeping - the flow is to a good approximation one dimensional in the vicinity of the inner edge .",
    "in order to calculate the inner disc structures we must make use of numerical hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "we use the zeus code ( stone et al . 1992 ; hayes et al .",
    "2006 ) , which has been modified by owen et al .",
    "( 2010;2012 ) to include the heating of circumstellar material by stellar x - ray photons .",
    "we use this modified code to calculate the mid - plane inner disc structure ; therefore , we run the code radially in one - dimension ( although we also evolve the azimuthal velocity ) . in the absence of x - ray heating",
    "the disc s temperature is set to the mid - plane temperature expected for a passively irradiated protoplanetary disc ( e.g. chiang & goldreich 1997 ; dalessio et al .",

    "2001 ) . as initial conditions we adopt a @xmath50 profile , where in order to convert between surface density and mid - plane gas density we assume the disc is vertically isothermal and use : @xmath51 this mid - plane density profile is setup in hydrostatic equilibrium including the necessary modification to the keplerian rotation due to the radial pressure gradient .     star with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath52 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "we note the outer boundary is not shown and is at a radius of 38 au in this calculation . ]    . ]    in order for the simulations to obtain stable configuration the boundary conditions require careful consideration .",
    "the outer boundary condition is implemented in order to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium across the outer boundary throughout the simulation , so sub - sonic radial flows are not allowed to interact with the boundary .",
    "explicitly we do this by maintaining a @xmath50 power law across the boundary and adjust the azimuthal velocity in the boundary cells in order to maintain this equilibrium . in x - ray",
    "heated winds , the mass - flux is determined explicitly by the conditions at the sonic surface ( owen et al .",
    "2012 ; owen & jackson 2012 ) .",
    "it is not possible to follow the flow to the sonic point in a one dimensional simulation since this occurs at a height @xmath53 above the disc .",
    "therefore we adjust the inner boundary condition in order to match the flow properties ( density , temperature , velocity ) onto the results of an on - axis streamline taking from the multi - dimensional inner hole simulations performed by owen et al .",
    "such a method is sufficient provided the inner boundary lies between the centrifugal radius and inner hole radius ( so the problem remains remains essentially 1d , see figure  [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "the radial grid is non - uniform , spanning @xmath54 $ ] - where @xmath55 in the radius of the inner boundary - with a high resolution of 200 cells ; typically this gives @xmath56 cells per radial pressure scale height in the inner hole region . in general , the structures are spatially resolved with a lower resolution , typically 100 cells ; however , the higher resolution reduces the scatter in properties calculated ( particularly @xmath30 ) . under this set - up the inner disc",
    "is then irradiated , with the x - rays driving a flow off the inner disc with a mass - flux specified by the conditions at the inner boundary ; this flow slowly erodes material from the disc resulting in an inner hole radius that increases slowly with simulation time .",
    "the evolution is slow enough that the structure maintains a quasi - dynamical equilibrium at each time - step .",
    "we stop the simulation once the inner hole moves to such a radius that the inner boundary is no longer outside the centrifugal radius , and the 1d approximation is no - longer appropriate . in figure",
    "[ fig : den_flow ] & [ fig : temp_flow ] we show an example of the quasi - steady state flow structure obtained from one of the simulations , for a disc around a 0.1 m@xmath4 star with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath52 erg s@xmath5 .    using 1d simulations allows us to probe a large range of the observable parameter space of disc models at high resolution .",
    "we perform roughly @xmath57 simulations covering a range of initial surface densities and radial ranges for two stellar masses . for the 0.1 m@xmath4 star we consider x - ray luminosities of @xmath58 and @xmath52 erg s@xmath5 and hole sizes in the range @xmath59 . for the 0.7 m@xmath4 star we consider x - ray luminosities of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 erg s@xmath5 with inner hole sizes in the range @xmath63 au . for each simulated radial range",
    "we vary the initial surface density normalisation at intervals of @xmath64dex over the range expected in clearing discs .",
    "these simulations are then used to compute how the ratio of @xmath65 varies with surface density , thus extracting the critical surface density for thermal sweeping and how it varies varies with stellar mass , x - ray luminosity and inner hole radius .",
    "our suite of simulations cover a large range of parameter space and provide the mid - plane structure of discs with large inner holes . for a given inner hole radius and surface density normalisation in the disc we use the simulation to solve for the ratio of @xmath30 to @xmath17 and can hence determine how this ratio varies as a function of the maximum surface density in the dust heated disc .",
    "an example of how @xmath65 varies with the peak surface density in a disc is shown in figure  [ fig : ratio_surf ] .     with peak surface density for a disc with an inner hole at @xmath66 au around a 0.7 m@xmath4 star and x - ray luminosity of @xmath52 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the points represent individual values computed at a given time in the simulation , where the scatter is indicative of the resolution .",
    "the dashed line shows a polynomial fit to the points .",
    "points which sit far from the line occur at early time - steps where the disc has not reached quasi - dynamical equilbrium . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio_surf ] demonstrates how we use the simulation data to calculate @xmath8 .",
    "we use the simulations to regularly store the current flow state ( density , temperature , velocity ) ; thus for each data dump we compute the ratio of @xmath65 , the current hole radius and the peak surface density of the disc .",
    "then for each radial range we string together all these values in order to produce a plot of how this ratio varies with the peak surface density in the disc .",
    "these data points necessarily have some scatter due to the finite grid resolution ( around 0.05dex for our resolution ) , and therefore we fit a polynomial to this data series ( typically a quadratic ) .",
    "we then use the fitted polynomial to compute the peak surface density in the disc at which @xmath67 and the inner hole radius at which this occurs . then we can combine the simulations at different radial ranges to see how @xmath8 varies with inner hole radius , x - ray luminosity and stellar mass .",
    "the resulting variation in the critical surface density for thermal sweeping is shown as a function of inner hole radius and x - ray luminosity in figure  [ fig : crit0.7 ] & [ fig : crit0.1 ] for discs around 0.7 & 0.1 m@xmath4 solar mass stars respectively . the finite grid resolution that results in the scatter in figure  [ fig : ratio_surf ] gives rise to an uncertainty in the surface density of @xmath68 dex which we represent as error bars in the figures .",
    "we emphasise this scatter does not mean the simulations are not spatially resolved , in - fact the simulations are well resolved ( we perform several resolution tests and note the simulations are resolved with @xmath69100 cells , we use 200 cells ) and the resolution has been chosen to minimise this uncertainty while allowing a computationally feasible parameter study .    ) shown as a function of inner hole radius around a 0.7 m@xmath4 mass star for three x - ray luminosities : @xmath62 erg s@xmath5 ( triangles ) , @xmath52 erg s@xmath5 ( circles ) and @xmath60 erg s@xmath5 ( squares ) .",
    "the error bars show the uncertainity in the calculation of the critical surface density introduced by the finite grid resolution ( see text and figure  [ fig : ratio_surf]).we also show a @xmath70 fit ( perfomed at 10  au ) as the dotted line , to represent the column - limited model ( equation  4 ) , which clearly fails to reproduce the simulations . ]     but shown for a 0.1 m@xmath4 mass star ]    the general trends of the critical surface density with inner hole radius and x - ray luminosity are characterised in figure  [ fig : crit0.7 ] .",
    "in general we find the surface density increases with radius as well as x - ray luminosity . at the highest x - ray luminosity of @xmath62 erg s@xmath5",
    ", we find the surface density is roughly constant at small radius ( @xmath71 au ) .",
    "this range represents the column limited case discussed by owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ( equation [ eqn : o12_crit ] ) , where the size of the x - ray heated region is purely set by the absorption of the x - rays and @xmath30 is simply given by @xmath72 . however , as we will discuss further in section  5 , over most of parameter space the extent of the x - ray heated region is set by a minimum ionization parameter , rather than an optical depth cut - off .",
    "in the previous section we have shown how the critical surface density for thermal sweeping varies with stellar mass , inner hole radius and x - ray luminosity .",
    "as expected we find that thermal sweeping will proceed once the remaining mass in the disc is low @xmath73 m@xmath74 .",
    "however , we do not find the shallow @xmath38 dependence expected from the owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) model , but a steeper variation with inner hole radius .",
    "furthermore , we find an explicit , roughly linear , dependence on the x - ray luminosity , not predicted by owen et al .",
    "in section  2 we outlined the two assumptions that underpinned the previous calculation : that the total column density in the bound x - ray heated layer is @xmath18 @xmath19 , and that the surface density at the inner edge of the passively heated disc may not be representative of the peak surface density in the disc .",
    "we find that while the second clause certainly plays a role , it is not the major reason why the simulations do not show the expected dependence .",
    "it is the first reason : that the total column density in the bound x - ray heated layer is not always @xmath39 @xmath19 and in the majority of realistic cases is lower than this value and a function of radius .",
    "for example we show in figure  [ fig : column_radius ] how the total column density and the ionization parameter at the transition from x - ray bound to dust heated layer varies with inner hole radius for the case of a disc around a 0.7 m@xmath4 star irradiated at a high x - ray luminosity of @xmath62 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "this figure clearly shows that , at about @xmath75 au the x - ray heated region makes a transition from being column limited to being ionization parameter limited , or more correctly x - ray temperature limited .",

    "the points show the radius of individual simulations . ]",
    "we can now use the above result : that the properties of the warm x - ray heated bound portion of the disc are set by a minimum ionization parameter rather than total column condition .",
    "since the gas velocity in the bound portion of the disc ( both dust and x - ray heated ) is extremely sub - sonic , we can treat these regions of the disc as being approximately hydrostatic . inside a radius @xmath76 ( i.e. radius in the disc",
    "at which the source of material for the wind is in centrifugal balance ) the specific angular momentum is constant and the effective gravity in the radial direction is given by : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the local keplerian velocity . now using the definition that @xmath30 is the radial pressure scale length in the x - ray heated gas we see that : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the sound speed at the outer edge of the x - ray heated disc and we have applied the condition for hydrostatic equilibrium normal to the disc plane , i.e. @xmath82 . so on the point of thermal sweeping ( @xmath83 ) , equation  [ eqn : delta1 ] tells us that @xmath84 so that @xmath85 .",
    "thus we proceed , in the limit @xmath86 and retain terms in @xmath87 to first order in @xmath88 : we solve for radial hydrostatic equilibrium in the dust - heated disc , where the approximation @xmath85 ensures that the dust - heated disc is approximately isothermal at a temperature @xmath89 .",

    "the innermost extent of the dust - heated disc is thus set by the condition of pressure balance with the x - ray heated region ( pressure @xmath95 ) - which we set as @xmath96 for convenience - and is given by : @xmath97 applying the condition for thermal sweeping ( @xmath83 ) allows equation  [ eqn : pprofile ] to be re - written as : @xmath98\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\exp\\left(\\frac{t_x}{2t_c}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can qualitatively understand this result by considering a case where @xmath99 is fixed .",
    "if @xmath100 is high then the x - ray heated gas can only achieve pressure equilibrium with the cold gas at a point that is relatively far from @xmath76 , so the effective gravity is large ( equation  [ eqn : geff ] ) and the radial scale length correspondingly small ( equation  [ eqn : delta1 ] ) .",
    "however , as @xmath100 is reduced , the x - ray heated region is pushed closer to @xmath76 , where @xmath87 is low and the radial scale length becomes larger .",
    "when @xmath100 is reduced sufficiently , the thermal sweeping criterion ( @xmath101 ) is activated .    this minimum value of @xmath92 can be readily converted into a minimum surface density criterion since in hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the sound speed at @xmath76 .",
    "thus we have :    @xmath104    however , equation  [ eqn : sigts ] only allows us to evaluate @xmath8 ( for a given radius in the disc and corresponding temperature of the dust heated disc ) if one also knows @xmath28 and @xmath95 .",
    "it is now necessary to consider the form of the relationship between @xmath105 and @xmath106 which we use to assign x - ray temperatures . in the dense conditions at the base of the x - ray heated flow ( i.e. at low ionisation parameter ) , the relationship is nearly flat at a temperature of @xmath107k and then steepens at @xmath108 , with pressure then declining mildly as the temperature is reduced below @xmath107 k. where the structure of the temperature - ionization parameter relation is determined by the falling x - ray heating efficiency with ionization fraction ( xu and mccray 1991 ) , in combination with cooling by lines ( owen et al .",
    "the number density on the cold side of the interface is such that the x - ray temperature at this point is equal to @xmath89 since in this case the x - rays would be unable to heat this region above @xmath89 .",
    "this condition sets the pressure at the interface ; on the x - ray heated side of the interface the gas shares the same pressure but has a temperature of @xmath107k , since this places it in the nearly isothermal portion of the @xmath109 relationship . we can see from figure [ fig : txi ] that a line of constant pressure ( @xmath110 ) that originates on the @xmath111 curve at a typical dust temperature of @xmath112 k crosses the curve at a value of @xmath113 , as indicated by our simulations ( see figure  [ fig : column_radius ] ) .",
    "we can therefore simply set @xmath95 and @xmath28 by requiring @xmath108 at this point , where comparing with figure  [ fig : txi ] and our simulations indicate a sensible choice for @xmath114 erg s@xmath5 cm@xmath5 .",
    "substituting this condition into [ eqn : sigts ] we obtain : @xmath116\\label{eqn : final_sol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in constructing [ eqn : final_sol ] from [ eqn : sigts ] we have also assumed that the temperature in the dust - heated disc follows a @xmath117 profile ( cf equation [ eqn : cg ] ) and @xmath118 is the dust temperature at 1au defined in equation  [ eqn : cg ] .",
    "we can compare equation  [ eqn : final_sol ] to our simulations by plotting @xmath119 for the two sets of simulations around a 0.1 & 0.7 m@xmath4 mass star . given the result for @xmath119 presented above has no further dependence on x - ray luminosity , but is only a function of mass and radius",
    "then the simulation points should line up along the same line .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] , where we plot the simulations ( 0.7 m@xmath4 - open points ; 0.1 m@xmath4 - filled points ) for the various x - ray luminosities to equation [ eqn : final_sol ] ( 0.7 m@xmath4 - dashed line ; 0.1 m@xmath4 - solid line ) .",
    "we see the agreement is exceptionally good , for the full range of parameters explored ( apart from the small radius runs at the highest x - ray luminosity that are column limited , and are not covered by the model as discussed above ) .",
    ": plotted as @xmath119 verus radius , and the simulations presented in section  4 .",
    "the open points and dashed line are for the 0.7 m@xmath4 star and the filled points and solid line are for the 0.1 m@xmath4 star .",
    "the square , circular and triangular points are for x - ray luminosities of @xmath60 , @xmath52 and @xmath62 erg s@xmath5 respectively . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : compare ] also clearly shows that thermal sweeping is more efficient around lower - mass stars , possibly indicating that it may become ineffective around higher mass stars , as the x - ray luminosity fails to increase with stellar mass around intermediate mass stars .",
    "furthermore , the general form ( equation  [ eqn : final_sol2 ] ) could be applied to cases where an optically thin ( to the x - rays ) gap is created by a planet ( e.g. rice et al .",
    "2006 , zhu et al . 2012 ) or by a combination of photoevaporation and a planet ( rosotti et al . 2013 ) , to see if planet formation could trigger rapid disc dispersal through thermal sweeping .",
    "confident that our model presented above can accurately predict the surface density of discs that are unstable to rapid clearing by thermal sweeping , we can now make observational predictions for the inner hole radius at which thermal sweeping clears the disc .",
    "we use equation  [ eqn : final_sol ] to re - analyse the disc population synthesis model performed by owen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which was designed to match the evolution of disc fraction as a function of time .",
    "the model well reproduced a large fraction of transition discs with small holes and low accretion rates , and fully explains the population of transition discs with low mm fluxes that owen & clarke ( 2012 ) identified as discs most likely to be transitioning from disc bearing to a disc - less state .",
    "however , in doing so the model also predicted a large population of relic discs with large holes and no accretion .",
    "this population is yet to be observed and owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) noted that this problem would be alleviated by the thermal sweeping mechanism .",
    "thus we take the synthetic disc population run by owen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and assume the disc is dispersed instantaneously by thermal sweeping once the disc s surface density drops below @xmath8 .",
    "we determine the distribution of maximum cavity radius for transition discs created by photoevaporation .",
    "the resulting radius distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : max_rad ] , where we plot the maximum inner hole radius reached before thermal sweeping takes over for discs evolving around a 0.7 m@xmath4 star with different x - ray luminosities .     star with an x - ray luminosity drawn from the observed x - ray luminosity function ( gdel et al .",
    "2007 ) . ]    figure  [ fig : max_rad ] clearly shows that thermal sweeping prevents the formation of relic discs ( i.e those with large holes and no accretion ) , explaining the lack of a significant population of transition discs observed to have large holes with no accretion .",
    "the trend of smaller hole radii reached around higher x - ray luminosity stars is due to the ability of thermal sweeping to begin at higher surface densities with higher x - ray luminosities . at low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath120 erg s@xmath5 )",
    "the hole radius is _ independent _ of x - ray luminosity : this is because both @xmath8 and also the surface density of the disc at a given radius at the point of photoevaporative hole opening scale linearly with x - ray luminosity and so equality is always achieved at a fixed radius . at larger x - ray luminosities , the process of ` photoevaporation starved accretion ' ( drake et al .",
    "2009 ; owen et al .",
    "2011 ) causes a slightly sub - linear dependence on x - ray luminosity for the disc surface density at hole opening .",
    "consequently the thermal sweeping radius declines somewhat with x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , at the highest x - ray luminosities this is countered by the fact that gap formation happens at earlier times and hence higher surface densities for stars with higher x - ray luminosities .",
    "furthermore , the rapid dispersal of transition discs created by photoevaporation at radii @xmath121 means that the ratio between the time spent in an accreting transition disc phase to a non - accreting transition disc phase is greatly enhanced , compared to the photoevaporation model analysed in owen et al . 2011 .",
    "for example , our new thermal sweeping models predicts that the median model ( @xmath122 erg s@xmath5 - figure 9 of owen et al .",
    "2011 ) , initially opens the hole at @xmath123 au and the disc is destroyed by thermal sweeping when @xmath124 au , with a remaining disc mass of a few jupiter masses .",
    "furthermore , it spends approximately @xmath125 years as an accreting transition disc and @xmath126 years as a non - accreting transition disc .",
    "thus , the addition of thermal sweeping suggests that transition discs created by photoevaporation spend the _ majority _ of their life as accreting transition discs .",
    "due to the variation of thermal sweeping with stellar mass , thermal sweeping can begin earlier around lower mass stars , and may become inefficient around intermediate mass stars , where the x - ray luminosity no longer increases with stellar mass above 1 - 2m@xmath4 ( e.g. guedel et al .",
    "2007 , albacete colombo 2007 )      one possible limit on the time - scale at which thermal sweeping proceeds through the disc is energetic .",
    "the multi - dimensional simulations that were initially used to investigate thermal sweeping enforced local radiative equilibrium .",
    "this condition meant energetic consideration were neglected ( see discussion in owen et al 2010 who demonstrated that for standard x - ray photoevaporation the mechanical luminosity of the wind is a comfortably small fraction ( @xmath127 ) of the x - ray luminosity of the source ) .",
    "so @xmath128 work done escaping from the potential was not accounted for .",
    "the dynamical time - scale on which thermal sweeping begins is not going to be limited by this consideration ( because the mass at the inner edge is small ) .",
    "however , as most of the disc material is at large radius , it may take longer than the dynamical time - scale at the inner edge for the disc material at such large radius to be fully heated up to the equilibrium temperature .",
    "we can estimate an ` energy - limited ' time - scale for clearing to occur by comparing the gravitational potential energy stored in the disc , to the rate at which the x - rays inject energy into the system .",
    "we can calculate the gravitational binding energy of a power - law disc of the form @xmath129 as : @xmath130 comparing this binding energy to the received x - ray luminosity , we find an energy - limited clearing time - scale of : @xmath131 where @xmath132 represents the fraction of x - rays intercepted by the disc ( the x - ray photosphere to the star occurs at height @xmath133 , owen et al .",
    "this time - scale is still much shorter than the clearing time - scale for the inner disc by standard photoevaporation @xmath134 years ( clarke et al .",
    "2001 , alexander 2006 ; owen et al .",
    "thus , we expect thermal sweeping to still be efficient in removing the outer disc .",
    "moreover , since @xmath135 , this energy limited time - scale is independent of x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , future multi - dimensional calculations that relax the assumption of radiative equilibrium will be required to fully assess the actual efficiency of the thermal sweeping process at large radius .",
    "in this work we have investigated the rapid disc dispersal mechanism for holed disc ` thermal sweeping ' , introduced by owen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) which takes over from photoevaporation and destroys the remaining disc material on a short ( @xmath0 year ) time - scale once the surface density of the disc has dropped to sufficiently low values .",
    "we use the criterion suggested by owen et al ( 2012 ) ( involving equality of the disc s vertical scale height and the radial thickness of the x - ray heated bound gas at the rim of the holed disc ) in order to define the point at which a disc will undergo rapid dispersal , using a large suite of 1d radiation - hydrodynamical simulations . in this way",
    "we identify the surface density at which thermal sweeping proceeds as a function of x - ray luminosity , stellar mass and inner hole radius .",
    "our results however do not replicate the analytic estimate presented by owen et al 2012 since this was based on the assumption that the extent of the x - ray heated region at the disc s inner rim is set by a fixed absorption column .",
    "instead we find ( apart from at the largest x - ray luminosities and smallest radii ) that the limits of x - ray heating are set by the ionisation parameter falling to the value @xmath136 , below which the temperature - ionisation parameter relation steepens strongly ( see figure 8) , at which point the x - rays do not heat the gas above the local disc temperature .",
    "we use this result to derive a new criterion ( equation 15 ) for how the critical surface density for thermal sweeping varies with physical properties of disc systems and find that this provides an excellent match to the simulation results ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "our main findings are summarised below :    1 .",
    "thermal sweeping can rapidly clear the disc , once the disc mass drops below a few jupiter masses and the inner hole is at sufficiently large radii @xmath137 au .",
    "the critical surface density for thermal sweeping to proceed scales linearly with x - ray luminosity , and increases with inner hole radius .",
    "thermal sweeping is considerably more efficient at clearing discs around lower mass stars and could possibly become ineffective around intermediate mass stars which have comparatively weaker x - ray emission .",
    "4 .   using the derived condition for thermal sweeping ,",
    "we show that transition discs created through photoevaporation are completely destroyed once their inner hole radii reach sizes @xmath138 au .",
    "the destruction of transition discs by thermal sweeping , prevents the formation of ` relic ' discs meaning that the _ majority _ of transition discs created by photoevaporation should be found to be accreting , albeit modestly ( @xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "future multi - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamic simulations are required to understand the details of thermal sweeping .",
    "in particular , energy considerations raise questions about how rapid thermal sweeping can be in heating the outer parts of the disc once runaway penetration is in progress . additionally , penetration and heating of the disc by the fuv radiation field ( e.g. gorti & hollenbach 2009 ; gorti et al .",
    "2009 ) may aid in thermal sweeping .",
    "the inclusion of fuv heating in hydrodynamic simulations still remains challenging , and we can not speculate on the role played by fuv heating in thermal sweeping at this stage .",
