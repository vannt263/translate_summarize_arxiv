    "glass formation in the absence of _ intrinsic _ disorder is a long - standing problem but the last years saw a rapid progress @xcite in the qualitative understanding of this phenomena .",
    "mostly this progress is due to the solutions of periodic models that assume a mapping between the periodic model and the appropriate random model @xcite .",
    "the validity of this assumption is still an open question in a general case but it was shown that at least one periodic model allows a direct study of a phase transition @xcite and non - ergodic behavior below the transition @xcite without any reference to a disordered model .",
    "this model describes a long - range josephson array in a magnetic field and another reason for the interest in this model is that it that can be realized experimentally ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of experimental conditions ) .",
    "all these results were obtained in the framework of classical statistical mechanics , the glass formation in a _",
    "regular quantum _ systems has not been addressed .",
    "the goal of this paper is to fill this gap .",
    "the problem of a glass formation in _ disordered _ quantum systems was discussed in a number of works @xcite ; these works studied the critical behavior near the quantum vitrification transition @xcite and the properties of the glassy phase itself @xcite using the replica approach .",
    "they found that the glass phase transition at @xmath2 indeed exists ; further , it strongly resembles classical ( high @xmath3 ) phase transition in the same system : the main difference is in the critical exponent of correlation function which decays faster than at the classical critical point : @xmath4 at @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "@xmath5 at non - zero @xmath3 ) .",
    "a surprising result stated in @xcite is that at zero temperature no replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) is needed for the description of the glassy state , i.e. replica - symmetrical solution is stable at @xmath2 . since",
    ", usually , rsb is believed to be a signature of non - ergodicity , this result means either absence of non - ergodic behavior at @xmath2 or violation of the usual relation between rsb and non - ergodicity .",
    "we feel that in order to clarify this important question , an approach that is free from the ambiguities of the replica method should be employed .",
    "understanding of a quantum glass formation in a system with regular hamiltonian is important for the general problem of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the reason is that quantum computer is also a quantum system with exponential number of states and the process of computation can be viewed as an almost adiabatic change of the external parameters resulting in a different state .",
    "the crucial question is what are the conditions so that such process does not lead to the collapse of the density matrix due to the coupling to the environment .",
    "this question can be addressed to the spin glass system as well and one can learn about decoherence in a generic large system with exponential number of states from the answer to it .    here",
    "we study the quantum version the long - range josephson array in a frustrating magnetic field that was suggested in @xcite .",
    "we consider here only the problem of glass formation , approaching the glass from the `` liquid '' ( i.e. insulating ) side .",
    "we show that the quantum version of this problem is described by the same dynamic equations as the quantum disordered p - spin model studied in @xcite .",
    "thus , we explicitly prove that this frustrated quantum system can be mapped onto the quantum disordered system in a complete analogy with the situation for classical problems .",
    "further , we provide a direct numerical proof that the transition in this model is indeed continuous as conjectured in @xcite and we calculate the anomaly of the diamagnetic response associated with this transition .",
    "another , and more physical , justification of the model is the following .",
    "it is well established , both experimentally ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) and theoretically @xcite that usual nearest - neighbors josephson arrays made of small superconductive islands demonstrate zero-@xmath3 superconductor - insulator transition as the ratio of the josephson coupling @xmath6 between the superconductive islands to the coulomb energy cost @xmath7 for the transfer of the cooper pair between the islands decreases . at small values of @xmath8",
    "the ground state is an insulator with nonzero coulomb gap in the excitation spectrum . at nearly - critical values of @xmath9",
    "the transition between insulating and superconductive states can be triggered by application of a weak magnetic field , producing frustration of the josepson interaction ; moreover , this transition can be splited @xcite into the sequence of two different transitions : superconductor - metal - insulator .",
    "although main qualitative features of these phenomena are understood , there is still no quantitative theory which describes quantum phase transitions in 2-dimensional short - range systems , especially in the presence of frustration .",
    "therefore , in our attempt to study the origin of a quantum glass state , we have to turn to the simplest ( theoretically ) model of a josephson array with long - range interaction , which consists of long superconducting wires ( instead of islands ) .",
    "it will allow us to employ some version of mean - field - theory and reduce the problem to a zero - dimensional quantum theory with the interaction that is non - local in time .",
    "the system of our study is a stack of two mutually perpendicular sets of @xmath10 parallel thin superconducting wires with josephson junctions at each node that is placed in an external transverse field @xmath11 .",
    "macroscopic quantum variables of this array are the @xmath12 superconducting phases associated with each wire ( e.g. the value of the phase of the superconducting order parameter at the center of each wire ) ; we will always assume that excitations within individual wire can be neglected , so the whole wire is characterized by one phase , @xmath13 . in the absence of an external field",
    "the phase differences would be zero at each junction , but this is not possible for finite @xmath11 , so the phases are frustrated . here",
    "we assume that the josephson currents are sufficiently small so that the induced fields are negligible in comparison with @xmath11 ( this imposes an important constraint for the experimental realization of this network @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the array is described by the hamiltonian = h_j + h_c = -e_j_m , n ( _ n-_m - ) + _ m",
    "m , n^-1 [ 1 ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent , correspondingly , josephson and coulomb parts of the hamiltonian , and @xmath16 is the matrix of the capacitances .",
    "there are several different contributions to @xmath17 : self - capacitances of the wires @xmath18 ( with respect to substrate ) , the contact capacitances @xmath19 and mutual capacitances of wires @xmath20 .",
    "below we will assume , that the self - capacitance is the largest of all , @xmath21 ( the factor @xmath10 accounts for the fact that there are @xmath10 contacts along each wire ) .",
    "these conditions allow as to neglect all mutual capacitances and consider the matrix @xmath22 to be diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of `` spin '' variables @xmath23 .",
    "choosing the landau gauge for the vector potential and introducing @xmath24 by @xmath25 so that the transition temperature remains constant in the limit @xmath26 at fixed @xmath24 we get = - _ m , n^2n s_m^ * j_mn s_n + _",
    "n q_n^2 [ h ] where @xmath27 is the charge operator conjugated to the phase @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the coupling matrix = (    cc 0 & + ^ & 0    ) [ j ] with @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the index of the horizontal ( vertical ) wires ; @xmath23 where the @xmath13 are the superconducting phases of the @xmath12 wires . here",
    "@xmath34 is the flux per unit strip , @xmath35 is the inter - node spacing and @xmath36 is the flux quantum .    because every horizontal ( vertical ) wire is linked to every vertical ( horizontal ) wire , the connectivity in this model is high ( @xmath10 ) and it is accessible to a mean - field treatment ( its classical version was developed in @xcite ) . for @xmath37",
    "there exists an extensive number of metastable solutions which minimize the josephson ( `` potential '' ) part of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) ; these minima are separated by the barriers that scale@xcite with @xmath10 .",
    "a similar ( classical ) long - range network with disorder was previously found to display a spin glass transition@xcite for @xmath38 ; in the absence of short - range phase coherence between wires @xmath39 ) it is equivalent to the sherrington - kirkpatrick model.@xcite physically this glassy behavior occurs because the phase differences associated with the couplings , @xmath40 , acquire random values and fill the interval @xmath41 uniformly . for the periodic case , this condition is satisfied in the `` incommensurate window '' @xmath42 for which the magnetic unit cell is larger than the system size so that the simple `` crystalline '' phase is inaccessible.@xcite there are thus no special field values for which the number of minima of the potential energy are not extensive , in contrast to the situation for @xmath43 . below we will consider the case @xmath44 only . as follows from the previous studies @xcite , the characteristic energy scale related to the potential energy @xmath45 is of the order of the glass transition temperature of the classical system , @xmath46 .",
    "the zero-@xmath3 transition we study here is driven by the competition between josephson and coulomb energies , the scale of the latter being @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we expect that the quantum transition occurs at @xmath48 .",
    "our goal is to show that such a ( continuous ) phase transition indeed occurs and to study the critical behavior near the transition point .",
    "below , in the main part of the paper , we measure all energies in units of @xmath49 , and return to the physical units only in the final expression for the critical behavior of the ac diamagnetic susceptibility .",
    "we are going to develop a diagram technique for the hamitlonian ( [ h ] ) which will be very similar to the one employed previously @xcite for the classical langevin dynamics of the same array .",
    "the idea is to treat coulomb part of the hamiltonian as the zero - level approximation , and construct expansion in powers of josephson coupling constant @xmath24 , keeping all the terms of the lowest order in the coordination number @xmath50 .",
    "thus our approach can be considered as quantum version of the thouless - anderson - palmer  @xcite method .    the diagram technique for the matsubara green function @xmath51 is closely related to the one developed in  @xcite .",
    "dyson equation for the frequency - dependent matrix green function reads ( note that in our units @xmath52 ) : * g_= [ gg ] where we introduced the local green functions @xmath53 that is irreducible with respect to the @xmath54 lines .",
    "the matrix @xmath55 depends only on the `` distance '' @xmath56 and acquires a simple form in fourier space @xmath57 ; therefore in this representation g_(p ) = + [ gg ] diagrammatically eq.([gg ] ) and the equation for the irreducible function @xmath53 are represented by the graphs shown in fig",
    ". 1 . *    note that the equation for @xmath58 is written in the lowest nontrivial order in @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , it is seen from eq.([gg ] ) that nontrivial part of the green function which contains critical slowing down , is of relatively small weight @xmath60 .",
    "it is this long - time part of @xmath61 which enters 3-line diagram on fig.1 and makes it proportional to @xmath62 ; more complicated diagrams either contain even higher powers of @xmath59 , or are small as @xmath50 .",
    "since the second diagram on fig.1 contains single - site functions only , the whole system of equations can be written in the form @xmath63 here @xmath64 , as in  @xcite , is a static value of four - point vertex denoted as a square box in fig.1 ( we assume that , like in  @xcite , the main critical anomaly is contained in the 2-point green function alone ) . equations ( [ g_full],[sigma ] ) should be solved with obvious initial condition : @xmath65 similar normalization condition in the classical problem was sufficient to determine @xmath66 exactly  @xcite . the same calculation seems to be difficult for the present quantum problem and we will not perform it here .",
    "instead , we will use general properties of the function @xmath67 , namely : i ) @xmath68 , and ii ) @xmath67 is analitic at low @xmath69 and has characteristic frequency scale of the order of 1 . in doing so , we will not determine exact position of the phase transition ( i.e. critical value @xmath70 of the coupling strength @xmath24 ) , but we will show the existence of continuous transition and find the form of critical scaling .",
    "let us first analyze equations ( [ g_full],[sigma],[init_cond ] ) omitting the term with @xmath71 , and using simplest interpolation @xmath72 .",
    "then initial condition  ( [ init_cond ] ) gives us the equation for @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath76 as long as @xmath77 . on the other hand , at @xmath78 the solution is @xmath79 .",
    "the value of @xmath80 determines the asymptotic decay rate of the green function g(t ) = ( -|t|a ) [ g0 ] with @xmath71 being neglected .",
    "it will be seen below that @xmath81 and thus @xmath76 near the phase transition point @xmath82 ( we will see also that @xmath83 and thus it is much smaller than the @xmath84 term at high frequencies @xmath85 ) .",
    "it means that the parameter @xmath80 can be considered as a smooth function of @xmath86 in the vicinity of @xmath87 .",
    "clearly , this conclusion does not depend on the model form of @xmath67 used in the above analysis .",
    "now we re - introduce @xmath88 into the equations for @xmath89 and focus on its low - frequency behavior at @xmath90 : @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "strictly speaking , eqs.([g_q],[sigma1 ] ) do not form closed system since @xmath80 should be determined with the use of eq.([init_cond ] ) which contains high - frequency contributions .",
    "however , in this high - frequency region ( which produces the main contribution to the normalization condition ( [ init_cond ] ) ) the contribution of @xmath88 can be neglected and thus @xmath80 can be treated as an external control parameter which governs the transition .",
    "green function defined by the eqs.([g_q],[sigma1 ] ) acquires singularity when @xmath94 . to find the form of this singularity",
    ", we make use of the scaling anzats @xmath95 and neglect @xmath84 term in the denumenator of eq.([g_q ] ) .",
    "then we find @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this critical - point solution matches the short - time asymptotics ( [ g0 ] ) at @xmath98 .",
    "the estimate for @xmath99 which follows from the above scaling anzats , @xmath100 gives @xmath101 at @xmath102 and @xmath81 , as it was expected .",
    "these estimates show that second - order phase transition with critical slowing down _ may _ indeed occur in the above range of parameters . in the next section we will study the vicinity of the critical point in more details .",
    "to study the form of the critical singularity , it is convinient to define universal scaling functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 which do not contain small parameter @xmath105 , and the parameter @xmath106 measuring the proximity to the critical point : ( ) = g ( ) ; ( ) = ( ) ; = / ; b = ( a-2(0))/[new ] now eqs.([g_q],[sigma1 ] ) acquires the following form : @xmath107 exactly at the critical point @xmath108 the solution of eq.([para ] ) is ( ) = ( ) ^1/4 ^ -3/2||^-1/2 [ critsol ] consider now the vicinity of the critical point , @xmath109 .",

    "the results of this computation are shown on fig .  1 .",
    "clearly , all three functions @xmath103 coincide in the high-@xmath69 region , there they are close the square - root asymptotic ( [ critsol ] ) .",

    "the above results refer to the zero-@xmath3 phase transition controlled by the single parameter @xmath75 .",
    "we found that this phase transition is a continuous one and the corresponding critical behavior differs considerably from the one found in an analogous classical model  @xcite .",
    "in particular , at @xmath2 critical point @xmath82 there is no `` plato '' solution with approximately constant @xmath130 at @xmath131 which is known to be a peculiar property of regular classical glasses .",
    "now we consider low but non - zero temperatures @xmath132 and will find how `` classical '' critical scaling `` grow up '' from the `` quantum '' background ; we also find the low - temperature shape of the phase transition line on the plane @xmath133 .",
    "green function is defined now at discrete frequencies @xmath134 and the equations  ( [ g_q ] ) , ( [ sigma1 ] ) can be written as @xmath135 it will be convenient now to perform analytic continuation of eqs.([g_t ] ) and rewrite them in terms of real - time correlation function @xmath136_+\\rangle$ ] and response function @xmath137_-\\theta(t)$ ] .",

    "( [ trelations ] ) ) a closed set which determines critical singularity at @xmath142 . formally eqs.([claschi ] ) coincide with the corresponding `` classical '' equations from  @xcite , the only difference is in the form of the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "let us consider low temperature region @xmath143 .",
    "as long as we are interested in the long - time asymptotic @xmath144 , the correlation and response functions are related by classical fdt : @xmath145 .",
    "characteristic times , which is relevant in  ( [ claschi ] ) , are also belong to classical region @xmath146 .",
    "therefore the correlation function at the transition point has the same critical behavior as in the classical case : @xmath147 .",
    "however parameter @xmath148 is determined by the `` quantum '' region of frequencies @xmath149 , i.e. by the equation  ( [ eqfora ] ) .",
    "the substitution of this expression to the equations ( [ claschi ] ) allows us to find @xmath150 in the short - time domain @xmath151 the zero-@xmath3 critical solution with @xmath152 is valid .",
    "equation ( [ thermalq ] ) demonstrates the way the `` classical '' solution with nonzero @xmath153 grows up with the temperature increase .",
    "correlation and response functions @xmath154 and @xmath155 are not directly measurable in our system , but they can be used in order to calculate measurable physical quantity which is dynamic diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath156 , like it was done previously for the classical problem  @xcite .",
    "total magnetic moment induced by time - dependent external magnetic field is given by @xmath157 where @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "then magnetic susceptibility @xmath159 can be found making use of the kubo formula : @xmath160 \\theta(t ) $ ] which leads to the expression @xmath161 here we omit the term , containing irreducible four - spin correlator ( of the order of @xmath50 ) , and take into account that @xmath162 .",
