    "besides , on the assumption of the spectrum of mini - quasars , instead of a simple power - law , one can also adopt a multicomponent spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also note that we have ignored the secondary ionizations from the mini - quasar emission in our model for simplicity .",
    "we caution that , until most of these properties of mini - quasars have been better understood , a stringent constraint on the contribution of mini - quasars can not be obtained . in turn",
    ", it is also reasonable to expect that , improved measurements of helium reionization , especially at high redshifts , coupled with the constraint from the sxrb , could be used to better constrain these properties of mini - quasars , which would make a relevant contribution to the solution of the puzzles related to the formation of smbhs at high redshifts .",
    "moreover , it is commonly believed that the feedback from the accretion onto central bhs could play an important role .",
    "for example , the radiation from accreting bhs can limit the gas supply by radiation pressures and photon - heating , leading to the self - regulation of the bh growth ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "additionally , @xcite suggest that the igm heating by mini - quasars can also suppress the formation and growth of central bhs in low - mass halos . on the other hand",
    ", the star formation in low - mass galaxies may be affected by both local and global heating from mini - quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
