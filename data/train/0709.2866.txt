    "bose - einstein condensation of _ dipolar _ gases has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite because it offers the opportunity to create degenerate quantum gases with adjustable long- and short - range interactions , which gives rise to a wealth of novel phenomena @xcite . in particular , the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in a gas of chromium atoms @xcite , with a large dipole moment , has opened the way to promising experiments on dipolar quantum gases @xcite .    as an alternative system with tunable interactions ,",
    "the bose - einstein condensation of neutral atoms with electromagnetically induced attractive @xmath0 interaction has been proposed . here",
    ", `` gravity - like '' , long - range interaction , in addition to the short - range ( van - der - waals - like ) interactions , takes the place of the dipole - dipole interaction in dipolar gases .",

    "the @xmath7 interactions of the retarded dipole - dipole interaction of neutral atoms in the presence of intense electromagnetic radiation are averaged out in the near - zone limit @xcite , while the weaker @xmath0 interaction is retained . the resulting atom  atom interaction potential in the near - zone is @xcite @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the isotropic , dynamic , polarizability of the atoms at frequency @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the intensity of the radiation .",

    "@xcite for co@xmath13 laser light of intensity @xmath14",
    "w/@xmath15 is equivalent to the attraction of two opposite equal charges with @xmath16 .",
    "however , by contrast with the van der waals interaction , the @xmath0 potential acts over the entire sample , and therefore its contribution to the energy can become important . instead of 6 triads of lasers a different arrangement with three rotating lasers has been proposed @xcite .    even though the experimental realization of such configurations is not yet at hand , the theoretical issues associated with monopolar degenerate quantum gases are worthwhile investigating . in particular , as pointed out by odell et al .",
    "@xcite , the intriguing new physical feature that emerges is the possibility of _ self - trapping _ of the condensate , without external trap .    in the theory of trapped bose - einstein condensates",
    "it is common to introduce as natural units for energy and length the quantum energy @xmath17 and the oscillator length @xmath18 of the trap potential . in the case of self - trapping , however , where the trapping potential is switched off , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus these quantities become `` bad '' units . as a consequence , in their study of the physical conditions necessary to observe the transition from external binding to self - binding giovannazzi et al . @xcite",

    "it is the purpose of this paper to re - analyze bose condensates with attractive @xmath0 interaction using appropriate `` atomic '' units .",
    "this will first reveal remarkable scaling properties of the condensates .",
    "next we solve the extended gross - pitaevskii equation for monopolar quantum gases numerically and compare with previous variational results .",
    "last , as a novel feature , we point out that our numerical calculations reveal the existence of a second solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation for negative scattering lengths , which is born together with the ground state in a bifurcation `` out of nowhere '' .",
    "the existence of the second solution indicates the existence of an unstable collectively excited state of such condensates at negative scattering lengths .",
    "we analyze the physics of trapped monopolar gases , and in particular the limit @xmath21 , in terms of natural `` atomic '' units . from the analogy",

    "using the `` order parameter '' @xmath38 instead of the single - particle orbital , one can absorb the @xmath3-dependence in ( [ hfat ] ) in the wave function @xmath39 , and obtains an extended ( or , for vanishing gravity - like interaction , the familiar ) time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation .    from ( [ hfat ] )",

    "for the example mentioned before one has an estimate of @xmath42  m , @xmath43 , thus @xmath44 .",
    "however , a central result of the present paper is that the physics of degenerate monopolar gases depends only on _ two _ relevant parameter , viz . @xmath2 and @xmath1 . to see this we note a remarkable scaling property of the mean - field hamiltonian in ( [ hfat ] ) : let @xmath45 be a solution of the ( formal ) _ one_-boson problem for a given scaling length @xmath41 and trap frequency @xmath6 , @xmath46 then @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , solves the @xmath3-boson problem for the scaled scattering length @xmath49 and the scaled trap frequency @xmath50 : @xmath51 \\quad \\hbox{\\rm with }   { \\tilde \\varepsilon } & = & n^2 \\varepsilon \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the proof is straightforward and left to the reader . from ( [ scaling ] )",

    "apart from a numerical factor , the relevant parameter @xmath54 is identical to the quantity @xmath55 used by odell et al .",
    "@xcite , but the universal nature of this quantity was not emphasized .",
    "the two asymptotic regimes of self - trapping dubbed `` g '' ( `` gravity '' ) and `` tf - g '' ( `` thomas - fermi gravity '' ) in @xcite are characterized by the size of the scaling parameter . for @xmath56 , the kinetic energy is negligible , and self - binding results from the balance between repulsive scattering and gravity - like attraction . for @xmath57 scattering",

    "the total energies of the condensates corresponding to the two solutions are also shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the energy increases from the bifurcation point on for the second solution .",
    "this would mean that above the bifurcation point there exists a _ collective excited state _ of the condensate in which all atoms occupy one and the same nodeless orbital , just like in the true ground state .",
    "the second solution is in fact present also in the variational calculation .",
    "it there appears as a second stationary ( maximum ) point of the mean - field energy given as a function of the width of the gaussian type orbital .",
    "the variational results for the chemical potential and the total energy of the second solution are also included in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the numerically accurate calculation is necessary for the quantitative description of the bifurcation .",
    "the second solution even persists in external trapping potentials , for any value of @xmath6 .",
    "the bifurcation diagram for two finite values of @xmath6 is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that with growing @xmath6 the bifurcation point is shifted to smaller absolute values of @xmath54 .",
    "the increase of the total energy of the second solution which is evident from the figures is a consequence of the fact that the self - consistent potentials become more and more binding and the wave functions more and more localized which leads to a dramatic increase in the kinetic energy .",
    "what is the physical meaning of the second solution ?",
    "we note , on the one hand , that it corresponds to a maximum of the mean - field energy functional .",
    "schrdinger s equation , however , and in our case equation ( [ hfat ] ) , follows as the euler - lagrange equation of a variational principle which only demands the energy functional to be an extremum .",
    "thus the fact that the second solution corresponds to a maximum of the energy functional does not preclude it from corresponding to a real physical quantum state .",
    "on the other hand , the two solutions are nodeless , and hence nonorthogonal .",
    "obviously this is a consequence of the nonlinearity of the extended gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ hfat ] ) : each solution creates its own self - consistent potential and thus sees a different hamiltonian .",
    "this would seem surprising since the original many - body hamiltonian is hermitian and linear in the wave function , and therefore should possess only orthogonal eigenstates .",
    "the nonlinearity of ( [ hfat ] ) is a result of the hartree approximation made for the states .    in studies of the decay rates in attractive trapped bose - einstein condensates , with contact interaction only , huepe",
    "@xcite have seen similar behavior , i.  e. , a second solution is born in a tangent bifurcation together with the ground state .",
    "these states also are nonorthogonal . analyzing the stability of the states huepe et al .",
    "have shown that the first excited state out of the two solutions is unstable with respect to macroscopic quantum tunneling .",
    "this is a strong indication that the second solution found in this paper in bose condensates with gravity - like interaction also corresponds to an unstable collectively excited state .",
    "a way to establish this is to linearize the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation corresponding to ( [ hfat ] ) around the stationary states and to carry out a stability analysis , as was done for the case of a pure attractive contact interaction by huepe et al .",
    "alternatively , by choosing a gaussian ansatz with time - dependent widths @xcite , equations of motion for the widths can be obtained from the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation and analyzed with standard stability methods of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "investigations along these lines are under way .",
    "we finally note that there is an analogy with bifurcations seen in investigations of attractive one - dimensional bose - einstein condensates on a ring ( cf .",
    ", e.  g. , @xcite ) . there , at a critical value of the ratio of the mean - field interaction energy to the kinetic energy ,",
    "symmetry - breaking , soliton - like solutions appear , in addition to the symmetry - preserving solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation , which are lower in energy . by contrast , in the example discussed in this paper , both bifurcating solutions possess the same symmetry .",
    "we have re - analyzed bose condensates with attractive @xmath0 interaction by introducing appropriate atomic units which are in particular adapted to the case of self - binding .",
    "we have thus been able to derive new scaling properties of such condensates .",
    "we have calculated numerically accurate results for wave functions and observables of self - binding condensates and compared them with previous variational results .",
    "it turned out that in particular at negative scattering lengths the variational results become poor and have to be replaced with our accurate numerical results .",
    "as a novel finding we have demonstrated that the critical point where collapse of the condensate occurs at negative scattering lengths is in reality a bifurcation point of the energy functional where both the ground state and an excited state merge and disappear . we have argued that this second solution indicates the existence of an unstable collectively excited state at negative scattering lengths in degenerate bose condensates with long - range attractive @xmath0 interaction .",
    "critical points , below which collapse of the condensate sets in , not only exist in attractive condensates at negative scattering lengths @xcite and in the monopolar gases with gravity - like interaction discussed in this paper but also exist in dipolar gases , in certain parameter ranges of the particle number , the scattering length and the trap frequencies @xcite .",
    "our investigations suggest that these also correspond to bifurcation points .",
    "studies of the bifurcation scenarios in dipolar gases are therefore strongly encouraged ."
