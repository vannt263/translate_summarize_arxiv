    "it s well believed that black holes exist in many astrophysical systems , such as in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , centers of galaxies , and some stellar binary systems . for a rotating black hole with an accretion disk , magnetic field threading the black hole and the disk could exist ( @xcite and references therein ) . due to the rotation of the black hole relative to the magnetic field , the black hole s rotational energy can be extracted through the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite .",
    "currents in the disk are needed to confine the magnetic field , but without using any mass accretion we can tap the huge rotational energy of the black hole .",
    "the blandford - znajek process provides a mechanism for extraction of energy from a rotating black hole which is more promising than the penrose process in practice @xcite . for a long time",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism has been considered as a reasonable process powering the radio jets in agns @xcite .",
    "recently , this mechanism has been invoked in models for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) where a rotating black hole with an accretion disk ( or torus ) forms through the collapse of a rotating massive star or the merger of a black hole with a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism is favorable for these phenomena since ultra - relativistic lorentz factors are required for jets in agns and grbs and it s believed that very clean energy can be created through the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , though some numerical calculations have been taken ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , by now there are no clear answers to such questions as how the magnetic field is generated , how it is distributed , how much energy can be extracted from the black hole and disk , what portion of the extracted energy is attributable to the black hole , and if the energy extracted from the black hole is clean enough .",
    "realistic cases are too complicated , we have very little observational clues .    in this paper , instead of searching for complicated numerical solutions , we consider a semi - analytical toy model to probe the blandford - znajek mechanism . the toy model is a kerr black hole with a toroidal electric current residing in a geometrically thin disk around the kerr black hole .",
    "the toroidal current generates a poloidal magnetic field threading the black hole and disk . due to the interaction between the magnetic field and remote charged particles",
    ", the rotation of the black hole and disk induces an electromotive force ( emf ) on the black hole s horizon and on the disk .",
    "this emf could be the energy source for remote astrophysical loads ( such as the jets in agns and grbs ) .",
    "the power and torque provided by the black hole and disk are calculated .",
    "it is found that for a wide range of parameters specifying the rotation of the black hole and the distribution of the current density in the disk , the power provided by the disk exceeds the power provided by the black hole .",
    "the torque provided by the disk is comparable to the torque provided by the black hole .",
    "this agrees with the results in @xcite and suggests that the blandford - znajek mechanism may be less efficient in extracting energy from a rotating black hole for the thin disk case .",
    "though the case of thin disks is simple for calculation , in real astronomy accretion disks may be geometrically thick and the case of thick disks may be quite different form that of thin disks@xcite .",
    "however the simple model presented in the paper gives a complete semi - analytical example : from the generation of magnetic fields to the extraction of energy from the black hole and the disk .",
    "the extension to the case of thick disks is extremely interesting and challenging .",
    "realistic cases of a rotating black hole with a disk and magnetic field are likely to be extremely complicated .",
    "however , if the the magnetic field associated with the black hole has a somewhat poloidal structure , it can be modeled as being generated by some toroidal electric current outside the black hole s horizon .",
    "this toroidal electric current most likely resides in the disk around the black hole .",
    "thus here we consider a model of a kerr black hole with a thin disk in the equatorial plane and there is a distribution of electric current in the disk .",

    "the magnetic field is most strong at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "from the simple model presented in the paper we have got some insight into the blandford - znajek mechanism . since the electric current generating the magnetic field must reside outside the black hole and most likely resides in a disk around the black hole , as described in our thin disk model , the strength of the magnetic field at the inner edge of the disk should be bigger than that on the horizon @xcite .",
    "the solutions of our model show that this is true . though the average strength of the magnetic field in the whole disk could be smaller than that on the horizon",
    ", the local strength of the magnetic field at the inner edge of the disk could be much stronger .",
    "in fact , in our solutions @xmath139 has never got smaller than @xmath113 .",
    "our solutions show that , for a wide range of parameters specifying the model considered in the paper , the power of the disk is stronger than the power of the black hole .",
    "the torque provided by the disk is comparable to the torque provided by the black hole .",
    "these results are physically plausible since ( 1 ) the electric current generating the magnetic field resides in the disk and thus the magnetic field at the inner edge of the disk ( where the current density is most strong ) should be stronger than that on the black hole s horizon ; ( 2 ) rapidly rotating black holes exclude stationary and axisymmetric magnetic fields @xcite , as seen from fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( left diagram ) ; ( 3 ) the disk has a surface area larger than that of the horizon and thus the magnetic flux through the disk could be larger than that through the black hole ; ( 4 ) the disk is a perfect conductor with a negligible resistance while the black hole s horizon has a significant internal resistance of several hundred ohms which consumes the power of the black hole and disk .    for the model considered in the paper",
    "the angular momentum and energy lost from the disk are important .",
    "as the disk loses its angular momentum , the mass of the disk gradually drifts towards the black hole and gets accreted .",
    "ultimately the power at the remote load comes from the gravitational binding energy between the disk and the black hole , as in the standard theory of accretion disk , instead of the rotational energy of the black hole .",
    "this implies that the blandford - znajek mechanism is not likely to be efficient in extracting energy from a rotating black hole with a geometrically thin disk and magnetic field .",
    "though the simple model is simple and convenient for calculations and we believe that some essential features for the blandford - znajek mechanism have been included , the limitations must also be emphasized : ( 1 ) we have assumed that the disk is geometrically thin .",
    "but in real cases this may not be true , especially for subcritical accretion",
    ". there could be an alternative type of models where , in the limiting case , poloidal flux is confined by and excluded from a funnel formed by an ion torus with adaf or adios solution where the disk s power is manifestly zero @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) we have neglected the magnetic coupling between the black hole and the disk .",
    "in fact there could be strong coupling between the disk and the hole with the former acquiring energy from the work done by the later @xcite , which might lead that some of the power of the disk effectively comes from the rotation of the black hole @xcite . in particular , loops of closed lines connecting the disk with the hole could exist and play important roles in transportation of angular momentum and energy . for a fast rotating black hole ( @xmath140 ) with a relativistic keplerian disk ,",
    "the rotation of the disk is slower than the rotation of the black hole .",
    "so the closed magnetic field lines will transfer angular momentum from the hole to the disk and reverse the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "accompanying the angular momentum , energy will also be transfered from the black hole to the disk via poynting flux .",
    "then for the remote load the energy directly extracted from the black hole is decreased , but it may be compensated by the energy extracted from the disk .",
    "we can imagine that with suitable conditions a steady state could exist when the power from the disk balances the energy flux from the black hole to the disk and then all the power of the disk effectively comes from the spin of the black hole .",
    "( 3 ) we have supposed that the poloidal magnetic field is generated purely by the toroidal currents in the disk . by doing so we have neglected the effect of the currents induced by the charges in the magnetosphere .",
    "this allows to calculate the poloidal magnetic field from the potential instead of solving the complicated grad - shafronov equation . with this approach",
    "the back - reaction of the induced charges and currents can not be taken into account , but it is particularly useful for semi - analytical investigations .",
    "( 4 ) we have modeled the toroidal magnetic field with a global poloidal current loop flowing through the black hole , the accretion disk , and the remote load .",
    "this allows us to conveniently compare the power of the black hole and the power of the disk since they have the same unique current .",
    "the realistic case will be more complicated since poloidal currents flow into and out of the black hole and the disk diversely at all radius .",
    "an alternative type of current loops is that the poloidal current associated with black hole and the poloidal current associated with the disk flow separately , i.e. we have two distinct poloidal current loops . in this case",
    "the black hole and the disk have different loads and it s hard to compare their powers .",
    "however if the disk and the black hole have comparable emfs and the impedance matching conditions are satisfied for both the hole s circuit and the disk s circuit , the power of the disk will exceed the power of the black hole since the disk has much smaller internal resistance .",
    "but in this case , even the black hole s power is only a small faction of the total power , it can still be important in practice if the energy from the black hole is very clean and not mixed with the energy from the disk @xcite .    in conclusions , for the simple model considered in the paper we have shown that the power of the disk dominates over the power of the black hole .",
    "this suggests that the blandford - znajek mechanism may be less efficient for extraction of energy from black hole with a thin disk .",
    "however , due to many simplifications we have made for the model , improvements are required for getting more thorough understanding of the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "especially the generalization to the case of thick disk deserves considerations ."
