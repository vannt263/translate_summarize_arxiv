    "recently , cms and atlas reported the observations of the signals , which can be interpreted as the presence of a standard model higgs(-like ) boson with the mass of 125 gev around the five sigma confidence level @xcite .",
    "the news seems to be accepted as the discovery of the long - awaited higgs particle , which is very essential in mass generations for the standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "however , the theoretical issues associated with the higgs boson , e.g. how the higgs can naturally exist at low energies , still remain unsolved .",
    "actually , these issues have played the role of strong motivations to study various new physics beyond the sm .    for the last three decades",
    ", the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has maintained the status as the leading candidate beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "the mssm provides a beautiful solution to the large hierarchy problem between the electroweak(ew ) and the grand unification ( gut ) or planck scales with the minimal extension of the sm in the supersymmetric ( susy ) way , which makes it possible to embed the sm in a fundamental theory like the string theory @xcite .",
    "the gauge coupling unification is another great advantage of the mssm .    : in the mssm , a relatively smaller higgs mass is preferred .",
    "it is basically because the tree - level quartic coupling of the higgs potential is given by the small gauge coupling unlike the sm . as a result",
    ", the higgs mass can not be even larger than the @xmath2 boson mass ( @xmath3 ) without large radiative corrections : by including the radiative correction by the large top quark yukawa coupling , the higgs mass can be lifted above 100 gev .",
    "actually , the lightest higgs mass in the mssm is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the top quark yukawa coupling , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the mass squared of the top quark and the soft mass squared of its superpartner `` s - top , '' respectively .",
    "the factor `` 3 '' results from the number of the colors which the ( s-)top carries .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side comes from the tree - level contribution , and the second term from the radiative correction ( @xmath8 ) by the top quark and the s - top . here",
    "we neglect the `` @xmath9-term '' contribution . in eq .",
    "( [ mh2mssm ] ) , however , the values of the top quark mass @xmath10 and also the top quark yukawa coupling @xmath5 ( up to @xmath11 ) have already been precisely measured .",
    "thus , the only useful parameter for raising the higgs mass is the soft mass squared of the s - top , @xmath7 .",
    "note that the radiative correction _ logarithmically _ depends on the s - quark mass squared ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "thus , raising the higgs mass with the soft mass squared of the s - top is not a quite efficient way .",
    "indeed , an s - top mass larger than a few tev is needed to achieve 125 gev higgs mass at two - loop level , unless the large mixing effect between the left and right s - tops through the @xmath9-term contribution is assumed @xcite . however , the s - top mass can not be arbitrarily large .",
    "the radiative correction by the top and s - top also contributes to the renormalization of the soft parameter @xmath13 , which is the soft mass squared of the mssm higgs , @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 indicates the gut scale ( @xmath17 gev ) , at which the soft parameters are assumed to be generated in the minimal supergravity ( sugra ) model . here",
    "we keep only the radiative correction coming from the top quark yukawa coupling , which is the largest correction to @xmath13 . the negative contribution of the last term in eq .",
    "( [ m2mssm ] ) causes the sign flipping of @xmath13 at the ew energy scale , which triggers the ew symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , one of the extremum conditions for the mssm higgs fields is modified as @xmath18 the radiative corrections add the last term ( @xmath19 ) in eq .",
    "( [ m22mssm ] ) . if a too heavy s - top mass is taken to raise the higgs mass by eq .",
    "( [ mh2mssm ] ) , @xmath20 and other parameters should be properly tuned to give @xmath21 , which implies that the ew symmetry breaking becomes unnatural . actually , eq .  ( [ m22mssm ] )",
    "is not directly related to the observed value of the higgs mass but closely associated with the naturalness of the ew symmetry breaking .",
    "it is known as the `` little hierarchy problem '' in the mssm .",
    "thus , e.g. for @xmath22 of 2 tev , the size of the tuning is roughly estimated by the hierarchy in the relation of eq .",
    "( [ m22mssm ] ) : @xmath23 in order to reduce the tuning in eq .",
    "( [ m22mssm ] ) , thus ,    @xmath24 smaller mass parameters need to be taken , but yielding @xmath25 gev ;    @xmath24 a low energy soft term generation scenario is needed for a smaller log piece in eq .",
    "( [ m22mssm ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will introduce a phenomenologically attractive scenario , addressing the above two requirements .    :",
    "in fact , 125 gev higgs mass could be achieved even with relatively lighter s - tops by considering also the `` @xmath9-term '' contribution to the radiative correction , which was dropped in eq .",
    "( [ mh2mssm ] ) .",
    "a large mixing between the s - tops of the su(2)@xmath26 doublet and singlet , @xmath27 , via the susy breaking `` @xmath9-term '' is very helpful for raising the higgs mass .",
    "particularly , the `` maximal mixing '' @xmath28 where @xmath29 , can lift the higgs mass up to 135 gev without any other helps in the decoupling limit of the cp odd higgs @xcite .",
    "however , as the mixing deviates from the maximal mixing , the enhancement effect drops rapidly . employing a large mixing of @xmath30-@xmath31 , hence ,",
    "would be a kind of fine - tuning in this sense . throughout this paper",
    ", we will not consider such a mixing effect .",
    ": in order to efficiently enhance the radiative correction , one might introduce the fourth family of chiral matter or extra vectorlike matter @xcite . in the case of the fourth family of the chiral matter , the top quark yukawa coupling and also the top quark mass in eq .",
    "( [ mh2mssm ] ) are replaced by the unknown parameters , which can be utilized to enhance the higgs mass .",
    "since such susy parameters appear outside the logarithmic function , they can efficiently increase the higgs mass unlike the s - top mass squared in the mssm .",
    "however , the presence of extra colored particles _ coupled to the higgs _ with order - one yukawa couplings would exceedingly affect the production rate and also decay rate of the higgs at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 : they result in immoderate deviation from the lhc data .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , indeed , the existence of such an extra family of the chiral matter is excluded at the 99.9@xmath34 confidence level for the higgs mass of 125 gev .    in the case of extra vectorlike matter ,",
    "in which a yukawa coupling of order unity with the higgs is still necessary for lifting the higgs mass , the lhc bound could be avoided by employing heavy enough mass terms for vectorlike fields . however , the tuning problem associated with the naturalness of the higgs mass becomes serious with the high scale mass parameters .",
    "is introduced and the superpotential @xmath35 , where @xmath14 and @xmath36 are the higgs and a quark singlet in the mssm , is considered , using the formula in @xcite one can show that the radiative correction to the higgs potential is @xmath37+{\\rm constant } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 indicates a renormalization scale . here",
    "all the soft mass squareds are set to be @xmath40 , and the `` @xmath9-term '' effect is ignored for simplicity .",
    "this expression is quite similar to that in the case of ref .",
    "however , the fields circulating on the loops in ref .",
    "@xcite are mssm singlets .",
    "] moreover , the extra vectorlike matter should compose the su(5 ) or so(10 ) multiplets to protect the gauge coupling unification .",
    "if the low energy effective theory is not embedded in four - dimensional su(5 ) or so(10 ) guts but in other unified theory defined in higher dimensional spacetime like string theory @xcite , we need to explore other possibilities to explain the 125 gev higgs mass .    : in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , the higgs mass can be raised by the tree - level correction of the higgs potential @xcite . in the nmssm ,",
    "the mssm @xmath41 term is promoted to a renormalizable trilinear term @xmath42 in the superpotential , introducing an extra singlet superfield @xmath43 together with a dimensionless coupling @xmath44 .",
    "the presence of such a trilinear term in the superpotential provides the quartic coupling to the higgs potential as well as a solution to the @xmath41 problem through the gravity mediated susy breaking scenario . by the quartic higgs potential coming from @xmath45 in the superpotential , the mass of the lighter cp even higgs in the nmssm",
    "is modified at the tree - level as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denotes the radiative correction by the ( s-)top . the tree - level correction `` @xmath49 '' in eq .",

    ", the allowed range of @xmath44 should be quite limited : @xmath52 the relatively small @xmath44 pushes @xmath11 to the smaller values for the 125 gev higgs mass : @xmath53 which gives almost the maximal values to @xmath54 in eq .",

    "@xcite , it was shown that the parameter space of @xmath55 and the trilinear coupling of `` @xmath42 '' ( @xmath56 ) in the superpotential to explain the 125 gev higgs mass can be remarkably enlarged by extending the nmssm with some other mssm singlets , compared to the original form of the nmssm : @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be also consistent with the higgs mass of 125 gev even without the mixing effect .    since the higgs mass is radiatively generated from a hidden sector and then it is transmitted to the higgs sector through a mediation by a messenger in this scenario , the fine - tuning problem can be quite alleviated by taking low scale messenger and mass parameters . in this paper",

    "note that a tadpole term of @xmath64 in the superpotential can be induced after the global symmetries are broken [ @xmath350 , but it is extremely suppressed .",
    "since @xmath345 and @xmath330 carry accidental @xmath351 charges of @xmath352 and @xmath353 , respectively , a domain wall problem would potentially arise .",

    "1 , when susy is broken .",
    "the tadpole of @xmath137 is also similarly renormalized by @xmath65 . ] even if @xmath366 , thus , the tadpole coefficients are just of order @xmath100 or smaller . with the minimal k@xmath317hler potential ,",
    "moreover , such divergences are known to be canceled out at the one - loop level @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the shifts of the vevs by the tadpoles , @xmath367 and @xmath368 are quite suppressed in our case , and so the gauge hierarchy is not destabilized by them . in this paper , hence , we neglect their effects .",

    "( [ ksinglet ] ) . without the factors , we had extremely huge tadpole terms , @xmath369 , which destabilizes the gauge hierarchy , since @xmath43 couples to @xmath14 and @xmath327 at the tree level in the superpotential eq .",
    "( [ superpot ] ) @xcite .",
    "we proposed a new type of the singlet extension of the mssm in order to raise the higgs mass to 125 gev with the alleviation of the tuning associated with the light higgs mass .",
    "apart from the ( s-)top quark s contribution , the higgs mass is radiatively generated in a hidden sector because of the mass splitting of hidden sector fields , and such an effect is transmitted to the higgs sector through the mediation by the messenger field @xmath104 . since the higgs mass is raised by the superpotential parameters , lifting the higgs mass is quite efficient as in the extra matter scenario .",
    "unlike the extra matter scenario , however , our model is free from the constraint on extra colored particles with order - one yukawa couplings to the higgs , which is associated with the production and decay rates of the higgs at the lhc @xcite .",
    "as shown in our previous paper @xcite , the parameter space for 125 gev higgs mass can be enlarged compared to the original form of the nmssm , and so even @xmath199 or @xmath58 , which is excluded region in the nmssm , can explain the 125 gev higgs mass with a relatively light s - top ( @xmath1 gev ) but without considering the mixing effect .",
    "in this paper , we also particularly emphasized that the fine - tuning problem associated with the light higgs mass can be remarkably mitigated by taking low enough messenger scale ( @xmath370 gev ) and light enough mass parameters ( @xmath371 tev ) .",
    "we have explored the least tuning condition ( @xmath273 ) , under which even the soft parameters much lighter than 500 gev can explain the higgs mass of 125 gev without conflicting with the lhc experimental results .",
    "it is possible because the newly introduced particles are mssm singlets .    under the assumption that the observed excess of the diphoton decay rate of the higgs over the sm expectation will persist",
    ", we also studied the way to enhance the diphoton decay rate in our framework .",
    "it turns out to be simply realized , only if the hidden sector fields in our model are converted to carry also electromagnetic charges .",
    "thus , the mechanism of the higgs mass enhancement and mitigating the fine - tuning can be closely related to the excess of the diphoton decay rate of the higgs in our framework .",
