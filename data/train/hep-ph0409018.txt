    "mixing of quarks or leptons belonging to different generations is suggestive",
    ". it could give a clue to underlying theories for the generations .",
    "for this end , we should get phenomenological information about the mixing as much as possible . until recently most experimental data for the mixing were on the quarks , though data on the leptons are accumulating from the neutrino oscillations @xcite . as a result , for instance",
    ", an examination of grand unified theories can now be made through comparison of the mixing for quarks and leptons @xcite .    the supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) is considered a plausible candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this model includes superpartners of quarks and leptons , which could also be mixed among different generations .",
    "if the ssm is indeed the extension of the sm , information about generation mixing of these supersymmetric particles will also help us to have deep insight into the generations . in future experiments , therefore , study of generation mixing in the ssm may well be an important subject .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a pair of different charged leptons , especially @xmath3 and @xmath2 or @xmath1 , could be produced at detectable rates in @xmath0 collisions , assuming the slepton generation mixing predicted by a certain scenario for the ssm .    in this article",
    "we study the generation - changing interaction of charged leptons , sneutrinos , and charginos without assuming a specific scenario for generation mixing .",
    "this interaction can create two different charged leptons with two charginos in @xmath0 annihilation through the sneutrinos on mass - shell , which may be measured in near future experiments .",
    "we obtain the cross section of this process within the general framework of the ssm .",
    "the same interaction , on the other hand , induces radiative charged - lepton decays , which are constrained by non - observation in experiments to date @xcite . under these constraints , concentrating on the production of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with two lighter charginos , systematic analyses are performed to discuss the possibility of measuring the interaction at @xmath0 colliders .",
    "particular attention is payed to the dependencies on various ssm parameters .",
    "it is shown that there are sizable regions of the parameter space which could be examined in the future experiments .    in @xmath0 annihilation a pair of sneutrinos @xmath4 are created if kinematically allowed : @xmath5 , where the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the generations . assuming that the sneutrinos are heavier than some of the charginos @xmath8 , the sneutrino can decay into a charged lepton and a chargino @xmath9 , with @xmath10 representing the generation .",
    "the generation mixing could be measured by tagging the charged leptons .",
    "however , it is suggested by both theoretical considerations and experimental constraints derived from radiative charged lepton decays that some sneutrino masses are highly degenerated .",
    "then , the generation mixing has to be analyzed without specifying the sneutrino generations @xcite .",
    "our analyses are made generically under an assumption that the sneutrinos of three generations are produced at the same collision energy and all the sneutrinos can yield a charged lepton of any generation .",

    "the mass eigenstates of the leptons or the sneutrinos are generally not the same as their interaction eigenstates . assuming that no superfield for a right - handed neutrino exists at the electroweak energy scale , the sneutrinos have a @xmath11 hermitian mass - squared matrix @xmath12 .",
    "the generation mixing of the sneutrinos is traced back to soft supersymmetry - breaking terms .",

    ", they have approximately the same value and are monochromatic in each rest frame of the decaying sneutrino . the chargino yields , by three - body decays , two quarks or two leptons with a neutralino .",

    "the mass of @xmath89 does not sensitively affect the cross section nor the decay width .",

    "( b ) , and ( c ) , we can see that the mass ranges of @xmath88 allowed by the radiative charged - lepton decays are not much different from each other .",

    "different values for @xmath54 and @xmath55 do not alter much the cross section and the allowed mass difference , as long as these mixing angles are small .",
    "for a larger value of @xmath42 , the allowed region becomes small , though the cross section does not vary much with it .    under the constraints from the presently available experiments ,",
    "the cross section of @xmath91 is larger than 0.05 fb in sizable regions of the parameter space .",
    "it should be noted that there also exists a charge conjugate process which has the same cross section . for the integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath96 ,",
    "more than ten events are expected there .",
    "although possible backgrounds have to be taken into account for estimating realistically available events , a number of order of ten would not be insufficient for detection in near future experiments .",
    "we comment on possible background processes .",
    "the two leptons @xmath1 and @xmath2 with missing energy - momentum can be produced by the @xmath97 pair production and their subsequent leptonic decays , which is due to generation - conserving interaction of the sm .",
    "this pair production occurs as e.g. @xmath98 , @xmath99 in the sm and @xmath100 in the ssm .",
    "the final states of these processes are similar to those of the discussed generation - changing process . however , there are wide differences in magnitude and distribution of the produced charged - lepton energy between the decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "an appropriate energy cuts will be useful to reduce the backgrounds .",
    "next , suppose that the masses of the charged sleptons are not much different from the sneutrino masses and , in addition , larger than the mass of the second lightest neutralino . then , a pair of charged sleptons are produced and can decay into two charged leptons with two second lightest neutralinos , @xmath101 . owing to possible generation - changing interaction of charged leptons , charged sleptons , and neutralinos , these two leptons could belong to different generations , such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "if the second lightest neutralino decays into two quarks with the lightest neutralino , the final state topology is the same as that of the lighter chargino decay which consists of two jets with missing energy - momentum . on the other hand , the second lightest neutralino does not lead to one charged lepton with missing energy - momentum .",
    "the background from the pair production of the charged sleptons is discarded by requiring that one additional charged lepton be contained in at least one hemisphere .",
    "the production @xmath91 could also be induced by the generation - changing interaction in eq .",
    "( [ cint ] ) through the pair production of different charginos @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the heavier chargino decays into one charged lepton and a sneutrino , and this sneutrino decays into another charged lepton and a lighter chargino , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "this process yields @xmath1 and @xmath2 in one hemisphere and thus will be distinguishable from the previous process which leads to one charged lepton in each hemisphere .",
    "therefore , the interaction could be examined independently by these two processes .",
    "we have discussed the possibility of measuring the generation mixing for the interaction of charged leptons , sneutrinos , and charginos in future @xmath0 collision experiments .",
    "numerical analyses have been made on the process @xmath91 .",
    "the experimental signal is given by a energetic charged lepton and two jets or a charged lepton with missing energy - momentum in each hemisphere .",
    "the experimental bound on the radiative decay @xmath75 implies that the sneutrino mass difference and the mixing angle for the first two generations should be small . under these constraints ,",
    "the cross section of the process is larger than 0.05 fb in sizable regions of the parameter space .",
    "the ssm parameters for the chargino and neutralino sector affect non - trivially the cross section .",
    "combined with information on charginos and neutralinos , the examination of the process will enable us to explore the generation mixing for the interaction . or on the contrary , the study of the generation mixing will give information on the ssm parameters .",
