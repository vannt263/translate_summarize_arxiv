    "exclusive nonleptonic decays represent a great challenge to theory .",
    "they are complicated by the hadronization of final states and strong - interaction effects between them .",
    "today measurements have already reached sufficient precision to examine our knowledge of these effects . in order to make real use of data in the determination of fundamental parameters and in testing of the standard model ,",
    "we are forced to provide a more accurate estimation of nonperturbative quantities , such as the matrix elements of weak operators .    at the first sight",
    ", the nonleptonic @xmath2 meson decay seems to be simple , as far as we essentially consider this decay as a weak decay of heavy @xmath3 quark .",
    "we are encouraged to use this argument by the facts that the @xmath3 quark mass is heavy compared to the intrinsic scale of strong interactions and that the @xmath3 quark decays fast enough to produce energetic constituents , which separate without interfering with each other . this naive picture was supported by the color - transparency argument @xcite and natural application to nonleptonic two - body decays emerged under the name _ the naive factorization _ ( discussed in detail below ) .",
    "however , although predictions from the naive factorization are in relatively good agreement with the data ( apart from the color - suppressed decays ) , the naive factorization provides no insight into the dynamical background of exclusive nonleptonic decays .",
    "the theoretical discussion of the nonleptonic decay starts with the effective weak hamiltonian , which summarizes our knowledge of weak decays at low scales ( for a review see @xcite ) : @xmath4 \\ , .",
    "\\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath5s represent the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements specified for the particular heavy - quark decay @xmath6 .",
    "strong - interaction effects above some scale @xmath7 are retained in the wilson coefficients @xmath8 .",
    "these coefficients are perturbatively calculable and therefore well known .",
    "actually , the weak theory without strong corrections and qed effects knows only the operator @xmath9 , and in that case @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the operator @xmath12 , defined in ( [ o12 ] ) , emerges after taking the gluon exchange into account and therefore its contribution is suppressed as @xmath13 .",
    "the main problem persists in the calculation of matrix elements of operators @xmath14 in a particular process . in ( [ ham ] ) we retain only the leading operators @xmath9 and @xmath12 and suppress explicitly so called penguin operators , @xmath15 .",
    "being multiplied by , in principle , small wilson coefficients , the penguin operators usually can be neglected ( except for the penguin - dominated decays ) , but could be extremely important for detection of @xmath16 violation in @xmath2 decay @xcite .    the four - quark operators @xmath9 and @xmath12 differ only in their color structure : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are color indices , and @xmath20 .",
    "the color - mismatched operator @xmath12 can be projected to the color singlet state by using the relation @xmath21 , as @xmath22 this projection , as can be seen from ( [ proj ] ) , results in a relative suppression of the @xmath12 operator contribution of the order @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the number of colors ) and in the appearance of the new operator @xmath25 with the explicit color su(3 ) matrices @xmath26 : @xmath27 depending on the process involved , the operators @xmath9 and @xmath12 can exchange their roles , and then it is customary to define the effective parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xmath30 these parameters distinguish between three classes of decay topologies : + - _ class-1 _ decay amplitude , where a charged meson is directly produced in the weak vertex ; i.e. in the quark transition @xmath31 with @xmath32",
    ": @xmath33 - _ class-2 _ decay amplitude , where a neutral meson is directly produced , i.e. in the quark transition @xmath34 with @xmath35 : @xmath36 - _ class-3 _ decay amplitude , where both cases are possible , but this amplitude is however connected by isospin symmetry with the class-1 and class-2 decays ; i.e. in the quark transition @xmath37 with @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the nonperturbative factor being equal to one in the flavor - symmetry limit .    the effective parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are defined with respect to the naive factorization hypothesis , which assumes that the nonleptonic amplitude can be expressed as the product of matrix elements of two hadronic ( bilinear ) currents , for example : @xmath41 and that there is no nonfactorizable exchange of gluons between the @xmath42 and the @xmath43 system .",
    "effectively , that means that the nonfactorizable matrix element of the @xmath25 operator ( [ tilde ] ) , is vanishing , due to the projection of the colored current to the physical colorless state .      the effective parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 could be generalized to parametrize also _ the nonfactorizable strong - interaction effects _ , for example gluon exchanges between bilinear currents ( i.e. in ( [ fact ] ) ) which introduce nonvanishing contribution from @xmath44 operators .",
    "schematically , in the large @xmath24 limit , @xmath45 where we have explicitly indicated that the nonfactorizable contribution to the class-1 and class-2 decays @xmath46 , do not necessarily need to be the same , and also they can be process dependent quantities , which will be discussed later . theoretically , nonfactorizable effects are desirable in order to cancel explicit the @xmath47 dependence of @xmath8 and therefore of the @xmath48 s .",
    "all physical quantities are @xmath47 independent , and because there is no explicit @xmath47 dependence of the matrix elements @xmath49 multiplying @xmath8 , there must be some underlying mechanism to cancel the explicit @xmath47 dependence of @xmath48 s persisting in the factorization approach . in the calculation of the wilson",
    "coefficients beyond the leading order , also the renormalization scheme dependence is presented @xcite .",
    "naturally , the parameter @xmath29 is more sensitive on the value of the factorization scale and on the renormalization scheme , due to the similar magnitude and different sign of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 terms ( calculated in the ndr scheme and for @xmath52 , the wilson coefficients have the following values : @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite ) .",
    "this means also that @xmath29 is more sensitive to any additional nonperturbative long - distance contributions .",
    "the global fit of @xmath28 and @xmath29 parameters to the @xmath2 meson experimental data performed in @xcite , has shown that the @xmath28 coefficient , being essentially proportional to @xmath55 , is in the expected theoretical range : @xmath56 while @xmath29 has the fitted value of @xmath57 compared with the theoretical values calculated with the @xmath58 and @xmath59 stated above , we note that both fitted values show no explicit indication that there is a significant nonfactorizable contribution in @xmath2 decays .",
    "this confirms the naive factorization picture , although the simple extrapolation of results in @xmath60 decays to the @xmath2 case would suggest that the @xmath29 coefficient could be negative , meaning a nontrivial cancellation of the @xmath23 terms and dominance of ( negative ) @xmath50 in ( [ as ] ) .",
    "the negative value of @xmath29 in @xmath60 decays has found its confirmation in the large @xmath24 hypothesis of neglecting the higher order @xmath23 terms , @xcite , and in the qcd sum rule calculation @xcite , where the cancellation of the @xmath23 part with the explicitly calculated nonfactorizable terms was verified .    however , there are additional indications that nonfactorizable contributions in @xmath2 decays can not be simply neglected and deserve to be investigated .",
    "new experimental data on @xmath2 mesons indicate nonuniversality of the @xmath29 parameter and the strong final - state interaction phases in the color - suppressed class-2 decays being proportional to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the nonfactorizable contributions must play an important role in nonleptonic decays , particularly in the color - suppressed class-2 decays , such as the @xmath1 decay discussed in sect.4 .      nowadays , there exist several approaches for the treatment of nonleptonic decays , which try to investigate the dynamical background and nonfactorizable contributions of such processes .",
    "the most exploited ones are _ the qcd - improved factorization _ , @xcite , and _ the pqcd approach _",
    "@xcite .",
    "_ the pqcd approach _ claims the perturbativity of the two - body nonfactorizable amplitude if the sudakov suppression is implemented into the calculation .",
    "the sudakov form factor suppresses the configuration in which the soft gluon exchange could take place , and the amplitude is dominated by exchange of hard gluons and therefore perturbatively calculable .    a somewhat different method is applied in _ the qcd - improved factorization_. this method provides the factorization formula that separates soft and hard contribution on the basis of large @xmath61 expansion .",
    "the leading nonfactorizable strong interaction can be then studied systematically , while soft ( incalculable ) contributions are suppressed by @xmath62 .",
    "the method applies to class-1 decays and to class-2 decays under the assumption @xmath63 .",
    "none of these models take nonfactorizable soft @xmath64 corrections into account .",
    "these corrections can be brought under control by using _ the light - cone qcd sum rule method _ @xcite .",
    "this method is going to be discussed more in detail in what follows .",
    "all qcd sum rules are based on the general idea of calculating a relevant quark - current correlation function and relating it to the hadronic parameters of interest via a dispersion relation .",
    "sum rules in hadron physics were already known before qcd was established ( for a comprehensive introduction to sum rules see i.e. @xcite ) , but have reached wide application in a calculation of various hadronic quantities in the form of so - called _ svz sum rules _ @xcite .",
    "the other type of sum rules , _ the light - cone qcd sum rules _ were established for calculation of exclusive amplitudes and form factors ( @xcite and references therein ) .      in order to illustrate application of the qcd sum rules and the main differences between svz sum rules and light - cone sum rules",
    ", we introduce an example .",
    "one of the typical calculation using _ the svz sum rules _ is the estimation of the @xmath2 meson decay constant @xmath65 .",
    "the starting point is a correlation function defined as @xmath66 in the euclidean region of @xmath67 momenta , @xmath68 , we can perform a perturbative calculation in terms of quarks and gluons by applying the short - distance operator - product expansion ( ope ) to the correlation function @xmath69 . the correlation function",
    "is then expressed via a dispersion relation in terms of the spectral function @xmath70 , representing the perturbative part , and the quark and gluon condensates , i.e. @xmath71 , @xmath72 , etc ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are perturbative coefficients in front of the vacuum condensates of operators @xmath76 , etc .",
    "on the other hand , in the physical ( minkowskian ) region , @xmath77 , we insert the complete sum over hadronic states starting from the ground state @xmath2 meson , and use a defining relation for @xmath65 : @xmath78 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath69 can then be written as @xmath79 where the hadronic spectral density @xmath80 contains all higher resonances and non - resonant states with the @xmath2 meson quantum numbers .    by applying _",
    "the quark - hadron duality _ to these higher hadronic ( continuum ) states , which means assuming that we can replace the continuum of hadronic states , described by the hadronic spectral function @xmath81 via a dispersion relation , by the spectral function calculated perturbatively in the @xmath68 region @xmath82 , we match both sides , @xmath83 , and extract the needed quantity @xmath65 . the replacement is done for @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is an effective parameter of the order of the mass of the first excited @xmath2 meson resonance squared .    in a practical calculation one performs a finite power expansion in @xmath82 . to improve the convergence of the expansion , _ the borel transform _ of both sides , @xmath86 and",
    "@xmath87 , is considered , defined by the following limiting procedure @xmath88 @xmath89 is so called borel parameter .",
    "it is determined by the search for stability criteria in a sense that , on the one hand , excited and continuum states are suppressed ( asks for smaller @xmath89 ) and , on the other hand , the reliable perturbative calculation is enabled ( asks for larger @xmath89 ) .    the general procedure of qcd sum rules is depicted on fig .  [ eps1 ] .        for calculating quantities which involve hadron interactions , such as for example the @xmath90 form factor , _ the light - cone sum rules",
    "_ are more suitable @xcite .",
    "the correlation function is now defined as a vacuum - to - pion matrix element : @xmath91 the calculation follows by performing a light - cone ope , an expansion in terms of the light - cone wave functions of increasing twist ( twist = dimension - spin ) .",
    "physically , it means that one performs an expansion in the transverse quark distances in the infinite momentum frame , rather than a short - distance expansion @xcite . instead of dealing with the vacuum - to - vacuum quark and gluon condensates ( numbers ) like in the svz sum rules",
    ", we have now to know the pion distribution amplitude ( wave function ) . the leading twist-2 pion distribution amplitude , @xmath92 is defined as @xmath93 distribution amplitudes ( das ) describe distributions of the pion momentum over the pion constituents and @xmath94 denotes the fraction of this momentum , @xmath95 ( for a comprehensive paper on the exclusive decays and the light - cone das see @xcite ) .",
    "the das represent a nonperturbative , noncalculable input and their form has to be determined by nonperturbative methods and/or somehow extracted from the experiment .    in the physical region of @xmath96",
    "nothing changes in comparison to the svz sum rules .",
    "we insert the complete set of hadronic states with @xmath2 meson quantum numbers as before , and extract the @xmath90 form factor from the relation : @xmath97 .",
    "the matching procedure follows as described above .",
    "although the idea to apply qcd sum rules for calculating nonfactorizable contributions in nonleptonic @xmath2 decays is not the new one , earlier applications were facing some problems which have caused unavoidable theoretical uncertainties in their results @xcite . in the work @xcite",
    ", a new approach was introduced and we are going first to review its main ideas in the application to the @xmath98 decay .",

    "it was introduced in order to avoid the @xmath2 meson four - momenta before ( @xmath108 ) , and after ( @xmath109 ) the decay to be the same , fig .",
    "in such a way , it was prevented that the continuum of light states enters the dispersion relation of the @xmath2 channel .",
    "states , like @xmath110 and @xmath111 , have masses smaller than the ground state @xmath2 meson mass and spoil the extraction of the physical @xmath2 meson .",
    "these parasitic contributions have caused problems in the earlier application of the sum rules @xcite .",
    "there are several other momenta involved into the decay and we take @xmath112 and consider region of large spacelike momenta @xmath113 where the correlation function is explicitly calculable .         [ triple ]      the procedure which one performs is exhibited in fig .",
    "3 . first , fig . 3a , one makes a dispersion relation in a pion channel of momentum @xmath114 and applies the quark - hadron duality for this channel , as it was explained in sect.2 .",
    "thereafter , to be able later to extract physical @xmath2 meson state , one has to perform an analytical continuation of @xmath109 momentum to its positive value , @xmath115 .",
    "this procedure is analogous to the one in the transition from the spacelike to the timelike pion form factor , fig .",

    "3c , a dispersion relation in the @xmath2 channel of momentum @xmath116 has to be done , together with the application of the quark - hadron duality , now in the @xmath2 channel @xcite . in such a way we arrive to the double dispersion relation .",
    "apart from somewhat more complicated matching procedure , the calculation otherwise follows in a standard way .      in @xcite , first , the factorization of the @xmath9 operator contribution in the @xmath98 decay was confirmed .",
    "the soft nonfactorizable contributions due to the @xmath117 operator , which express the exchange of soft gluons between two pions in fig .",

    "therefore , their impact on the complete decay amplitude was shown to be of the same order as that of hard nonfactorizable contributions calculated in the qcd - improved factorization approach @xcite .",
    "also , the calculation has shown no imaginary phase from the soft contributions , whereas aforementioned hard nonfactorizable contributions get small complex phase because of the final state rescattering due to the hard gluon exchange .",

    "the confirmation of this assumption seems to be also found experimentally .",
