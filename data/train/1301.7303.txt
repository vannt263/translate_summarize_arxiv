    "a new boson with a mass of about 126 gev has been discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the particle is likely to be the higgs boson .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the higgs sector in the standard model ( sm ) is correct , because the scalar boson with the similar property to the sm higgs boson can be predicted in higgs sectors extended from the sm one .",
    "on the other hand , new physics models beyond the sm have often been considered by introducing extended higgs sectors to explain new phenomena such as the neutrino oscillation  @xcite , the existence of dark matter  @xcite and the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite , all of which can not be explained in the sm . therefore , determining the higgs sector is paramountly important to know what kind of the new physics exists at the tev scale .",
    "the electroweak rho parameter is important to determine the structure of the higgs sector .",
    "the experimental value of the rho parameter is close to unity  @xcite , which suggests that there is a global su(2 ) symmetry , so - called the custodial symmetry , in the higgs sector .",
    "the rho parameter strongly depends on the property of the higgs sector ; i.e. , the number of higgs multiplets and their hypercharges . in the higgs sector",
    "composed from only su(2 ) doublets and/or singlets , the rho parameter is unity at the tree level because of the custodial symmetry .",
    "thus , these higgs sectors can be regarded as the natural extension of the sm higgs sector . on the other hand",
    ", the rho parameter deviates from unity at the tree level for the higgs sector with exotic representation fields such as triplets .",
    "in such a model , a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of such an exotic field violates the custodial symmetry , so that the vev is severely constrained by the rho parameter data .",
    "there is another extended higgs sector in which an alignment of the triplet vevs makes the rho parameter to be unity at the tree level , named as the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the addition of the isospin septet field with the hypercharge @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 to be the electromagnetic charge and third component of the isospin , respectively . ] does not change the rho parameter from unity at the tree level . in order to discriminate these exotic higgs sectors",
    ", we need to measure the other observables which are sensitive to the structure of the higgs sector .    as a striking feature of exotic higgs sectors",
    ", there appears the @xmath11 vertex at the tree level  @xcite , where @xmath12 are physical singly - charged higgs bosons . in the multi - doublet model ,",
    "this vertex is induced at the one - loop level , so that the magnitude of the @xmath11 vertex tends to be smaller than that in exotic higgs sectors  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a precise measurement of the @xmath11 vertex can be used to discriminate exotic higgs sectors such as the gm model and the higgs sector with a septet field .",
    "the feasibility of measuring this vertex has been discussed in ref .",

    "@xcite at the tevatron , at the lhc  @xcite and at the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the other method to probe or constrain exotic higgs sectors by focusing on the sm - like higgs boson couplings with the gauge bosons @xmath13 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) . at present",

    "the higgs boson couplings will be measured at future colliders as precisely as possible .",
    "for example , the @xmath13 couplings are supposed to be measured with the @xmath16 accuracy at the hi - luminosity lhc with the collision energy to be 14 tev and the integrated luminosity to be 3000  fb@xmath17  @xcite .",
    "in addition , they can be measured with the @xmath18 accuracy at the ilc with the collision energy to be @xmath19 gev and the integrated luminosity to be @xmath19 fb@xmath17  @xcite .    in models with multi - doublet structure ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath13 vertex is smaller than that of the corresponding sm vertices . on the other hand",
    ", they can be larger than the sm prediction in exotic higgs sectors . thus , measuring the @xmath13 vertex can be the other and more important tool to constrain exotic higgs sectors in addition to measuring the rho parameter and @xmath11 vertex .",
    "we also discuss the deviation in the yukawa coupling @xmath2 as well .",
    "we first derive the formula for the @xmath13 vertex in the general higgs sector .",
    "we then discuss the possible deviations in the @xmath13 and @xmath2 vertices in several concrete extended higgs models .",
