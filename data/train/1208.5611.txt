    "understanding the meson mass spectrum in the region below 2 gev is one of the fundamental problems of qcd .",
    "while the quark model seems to work very well for many resonances , some fundamental questions , such as the constituent quark content of scalar and axial - vector resonances , are still unanswered .",
    "the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite suggests in the region below 1.8 gev the existence of five @xmath1 states : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ; two @xmath7 states : @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; and two @xmath10 states : @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 .",
    "a description of all mentioned scalar states as @xmath0 states is not possible , since the number of physical resonances is much larger than the number of resonances that can be constructed within a @xmath0 picture of mesons , e.g. in the isoscalar sector two states compared to five experimentally seen resonances .",
    "the question is : which of the five states are ( predominantly ) quarkonia ?",
    "understanding these issues is not only crucial for hadron vacuum spectroscopy but is also important at nonzero temperatures and densities , because the correct identification of the chiral partner of the pion and of the @xmath14 meson is necessary for a proper description of the in - medium properties of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the answers to this fundamental question is in principle contained in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "unfortunately , qcd can not be solved by analytic means from first principles in the low - energy domain .",
    "for this reason , effective theories have been developed which share some of the underlying symmetries of qcd .",
    "the qcd lagrangian exhibits , in addition to the local @xmath15 color symmetry and the discrete @xmath16 symmetry , a global @xmath17 chiral symmetry which is broken in several ways : spontaneously [ due to the chiral condensate @xmath18 , explicitly ( due to non - vanishing quark masses ) , as well as at the quantum level [ the @xmath19 anomaly ] .    in the framework of effective theories the chiral symmetry of qcd can be realized along two lines : linearly @xcite and non - linearly @xcite . in this contribution , we present a linear sigma model containing scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial - vector mesons with both non - strange and strange quantum numbers . in view of the large number of the fields involved , our model shall be referred to as the `` extended linear sigma model '' , or `` elsm '' .",

    "similarly , the isospin triplet @xmath70 can be assigned to different physical resonances  although , in this case , there are only two candidate states : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "an analogous statement holds for the scalar kaon @xmath71 that can be assigned to the resonances @xmath11 or @xmath13 .    in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] )",

    "@xcite ] . besides this explicit symmetry breaking the chiral symmetry",
    "is also broken spontaneously .",

    "moreover , the parameter @xmath80 describes the axial anomaly , i.e. , the @xmath19 symmetry is explicitly broken by this term .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the fields with nonzero vev s are shifted by their expectation values , namely , @xmath81 , where we have introduced @xmath82 . after substituting the shifted fields into the lagrangian , one obtains the tree - level masses by selecting all terms quadratic in the fields .",
    "the ( square ) mass matrices are in general non - diagonal due to the mixing among particles sitting in the center of a given nonet .",
    "besides the mixing inside the nonets there are other terms which mix different nonets because of the vacuum expectation values of the @xmath83 fields .",
    "the mass matrices can be diagonalized by appropriate orthogonal transformations . in order to retain the canonical normalization for the fields",
    ", one has to introduce wavefunction renormalization constants , too .    from the lagrangian one can also derive several decay widths .",
    "the mass and decay - width formulas can be found in ref .",
    "we perform a global fit of the parameters of the lagrangian to experimentally known quantities ( decay constants , masses , and decay widths as well as amplitudes ) , for details see ref .",
    "we do not include the scalar - isoscalar states into the fit , but we test _ a posteriori _ their assignment and phenomenology .",
    "we do , however , include the isotriplet and isodoublet quark - antiquark scalar states and we test all four combinations @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "quite remarkably , the outcome of the fit is univocal : only the pair @xmath84 yields a good fit , while the other combinations do not .",
    "we thus conclude that the @xmath7 and @xmath10 quark - antiquark scalar resonances lie above 1 gev .",
    "in fact , the quality of our fit is surprisingly good . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fit ] we describe all experimental quantities with an average error of 5% , and most of them even to much better precision .",
    "we then study the two isoscalar mesons of the model . setting the (",
    "large-@xmath88 suppressed ) parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the lagrangian to zero , these masses turn out to be about @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 gev , respectively .",
    "our results for @xmath68 are in agreement with the experimental decay widths of @xmath93 our theoretical value for @xmath94 turns out to be too large , while @xmath95 vanishes , because @xmath96 is a pure @xmath97 state .",
    "nevertheless , our model predicts the existence of a scalar - isoscalar state which decays predominantly into kaons ; this is indeed the decay pattern shown by @xmath98 for these reasons we identify our state @xmath99 as ( predominantly ) @xmath6 .",
    "it should be stressed that a quantitative study of the scalar - isoscalar system can not be performed at present because our model does not contain the glueball state , the mass of which is around 1.5 gev and which mixes with the two @xmath100 scalar - isoscalar states , forming the three physical states in the 1.31.7 gev energy region .",
    "we have presented a linear sigma model with three flavors and global chiral @xmath72 symmetry .",
    "the model implements the symmetries of qcd , the discrete @xmath16 symmetry , the global @xmath101 chiral symmetry , and the breaking mechanisms of the latter symmetry .",
    "the model includes meson states up to energies of @xmath102 gev .",
    "this energy region exhibits numerous resonances , related by scattering reactions and decays . for this reason ,",
    "a realistic model of qcd degrees of freedom in the mentioned energy region should describe as many of the resonances as possible .",
    "thus , we have constructed a linear sigma model that contains scalar ( two isoscalars , @xmath68 and @xmath99 , as well as an isotriplet , @xmath70 , and two isodoublets , @xmath71 ) , pseudoscalar ( @xmath103 , @xmath54 , @xmath43 , @xmath56 ) , vector ( @xmath14 , @xmath104 , @xmath60 , @xmath105 ) , and axial - vector [ @xmath106 , @xmath61 , @xmath52 , @xmath63 ] degrees of freedom .",
    "the model , dubbed extended linear sigma model ( elsm ) , has allowed us to study the overall phenomenology of mesons and , in particular , to explore the nature of scalar and axial - vector resonances . in order to test our model we have performed a global fit to 21 experimental quantities involving both the ( pseudo)scalar and the ( axial-)vector masses and decays . due to mixing with the scalar glueball ( not included here ) , we did not include the scalar - isoscalar resonances in the fit .",
    "similarly , we have omitted the axial - vector resonance @xmath108 due to the fact that in reality a large mixing of two kaonic fields from the @xmath109 and @xmath110 nonets takes place .",
    "one of the central questions of our discussions has been the assignment of the scalar states : to this end we have tested the possible scenarios for the isotriplet and isodoublet scalar states by assigning our scalar fields @xmath70 to @xmath8 or @xmath9 and @xmath71 to @xmath11 or @xmath13 .",
    "the outcome is univocal : the global fit works well only if the states @xmath9 and @xmath13 are interpreted as quark - antiquark states . on the contrary , the other combinations deliver large and unacceptable values of @xmath111 .",
    "we thus conclude that the scalar @xmath7 and @xmath10 states have to be identified with the resonances @xmath9 and @xmath112 moreover , the overall phenomenology described by the fit is very good , see ref .",
    "the good agreement with data also shows that the axial - vector mesons can be interpreted , just as their vector chiral partners , as quark - antiquark states .",
    "we have then studied the consequences of our fit .",
    "we have primarily concentrated on the scalar - isoscalar sector which was not included in the fit . in the large @xmath113 limit it is possible to make clear predictions for the two states @xmath68 and @xmath99 .",
    "their masses lie above 1 gev and their decay patterns have led us to identify @xmath68 with ( predominantly ) @xmath4 and @xmath99 with ( predominantly ) @xmath98 the theoretical decay rates of @xmath68 are in agreement with experiment ; @xmath99 decays only into kaons , but turns out to be too wide . at a qualitative level",
    ", this large-@xmath113 result clearly shows that also the scalar - isoscalar quark - antiquark states lie above 1 gev .",
    "however , in this system the inclusion of an additional glueball state would be necessary for a full quantitative study .",
    "mixing phenomena are known to be large here and affect both the masses and decays .",
    "the study of a genuine three - state system is mandatory : starting from @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 to describe properly @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath6 .",
