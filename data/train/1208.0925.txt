    "let us consider solutions of the linear wave equation on a manifold @xmath4 , with ( possibly empty ) boundary @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath8 .",
    "when dealing with the cauchy problem for nonlinear wave equations , one starts with perturbative techniques and faces the difficulty of controlling the size of solutions to the linear equation in terms of the size of the initial data .",
    "of course , one has to quantify this notion of size by specifying a suitable ( space - time ) norm .",
    "it turns out that , especially at low regularities , mixed norms of type @xmath9 are particularly useful .",
    "moreover , the arguments leading to such estimates turn out to be useful when considering spectral cluster estimates , which are of independent interest ( see @xcite ) .    on any smooth riemannian manifold without boundary , the following set of so - called strichartz estimates holds for solutions of the wave equation ( for @xmath10 )",
    "@xmath11 denotes the dimension of the manifold , we have @xmath12 ( which is consistent with scaling ) and where the pair @xmath13 is wave - admissible , i.e. @xmath14 when equality holds in we say that the pair @xmath13 is sharp wave - admissible . here",
    "@xmath15 denotes the ( homogeneous ) @xmath16 sobolev space over @xmath8 .",
    "such inequalities were long ago established for minkowski space , where they hold globally in time ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "their local in time version may be generalized to any @xmath18 where @xmath19 is smooth ( thanks to the finite speed of propagation ) , while global in time estimates require stronger geometric requirements of global nature on the metric .",
    "the canonical path leading to such strichartz estimates is to obtain a stronger , fixed time , dispersion estimate , which is then combined with energy conservation , interpolation and @xmath20 arguments to obtain .",
    "let us denote by @xmath21 the half - wave propagators in flat space , and @xmath220,\\infty[)$ ] .",
    "the following dispersion inequality holds : @xmath23 our aim in the present paper is to obtain these estimates inside domains .",
    "in fact , @xcite outlines a roadmap to prove such a dispersion estimate , on a finite time interval , for solutions of inside a strictly convex domain @xmath4 of dimension @xmath1 . a complete description of the geometry of the ( semi - classical ) wave front set is provided for the solution to with initial data @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a point sufficiently close to the boundary ( depending on the scale @xmath26 ) .",
    "this wave front set has caustics developing in arbitrarily small times and this induces a loss of @xmath27 in for the @xmath28 factor .    in the present work",
    ", we aim at completing the roadmap by constructing a suitable parametrix for such a solution and then proving dispersion for the approximated solution .",
    "it should be noted that parametrices have been available for the boundary value problem for a long time , see @xcite , as a crucial tool to establish propagation of singularities for the wave equation on domains .",
    "however , while efficient at proving that singularities travel along the ( generalized ) bi - characteristic flow , they do not seem strong enough to obtain dispersion , at least in the presence of gliding rays . in the outside of a strictly convex obstacle ( no gliding rays ) , the melrose - taylor parametrix was utilized in @xcite to prove strichartz estimates hold as in the @xmath29 case .",
    "all other positive results ( @xcite and references therein ) rely instead on reflecting the metric across the boundary and considering a boundary less manifold with a lipschitz metric across an interface , and then using the machinery originally developed for low regularity metrics @xcite and spectral cluster estimates @xcite . such constructions do away with multiply reflected rays by suitable microlocalizations : one ends up working on a possibly very small time interval , depending on the incidence of the wave packet under consideration , such that all corresponding rays are only reflected once . summing these intervals induces ( scale - invariant ) losses , which get worse with dimension ; while strichartz estimates are obtained in a more direct way in @xcite , one can observe that the corresponding dispersion estimate would have at most @xmath30 decay for @xmath31 , as the argument is blind to the full dispersion which should occur in tangential directions . on the other hand ,",
    "negative results were obtained in @xcite , where a special solution is constructed , propagating a cusp across multiple reflections and providing a counterexample to the sharp strichartz estimates , for @xmath32 .",
    "this special solution is constructed via a microlocal parametrix which utilizes the melrose one , and our present construction generalizes this special example while retaining most of its useful features . +",
    "before stating our main result , we briefly introduce the friedlander s model domain of the half - space @xmath33 with laplace operator given by @xmath34    by rotational symmetry , we will eventually reduce to the two - dimensional case @xmath35 .    for the metric @xmath36 ,",
    "the laplace - beltrami operator is @xmath37 which is self adjoint with the volume form @xmath38 .",
    "the friedlander s model uses instead the laplace operator associated to the dirichlet form @xmath39 and is self adjoint with volume form @xmath40 . as a model , the friedlander operator @xmath41 is better than the laplacian @xmath42 since it allows explicit computations .",
    "clearly , manifold @xmath43 is a strictly convex domain : in fact , on the geodesic flow starting at @xmath440,1[$ ] , one has @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , @xmath46 may be seen as a simplified model for the disk @xmath47 with polar coordinates @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "we will always work with the dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "the neumann boundary condition can be handled exactly in the same way , providing the same results : one simply modifies the reflexion coefficient in our parametrix construction and replaces zeros of the airy function @xmath52 by zeros of its derivative @xmath53 .",

    "we will prove in fact a slightly better estimate than : the @xmath65 factor may be replace by @xmath66 for @xmath67 ( proposition [ propadisp ] ) and by @xmath68 for @xmath69 ( theorem [ thl1 ] ) .",

    "we will see soon that this optimal loss is due to swallowtail type singularities in the wave front set of @xmath58 .",
    "note that when @xmath79 , where we gain from the factor @xmath80 , the loss in is still greater than the usual dispersive estimate in the flat case : this requires @xmath81 whereas we have @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , in this range , the loss is also greater than the loss which would occur if we had only cusp singularities .",
    "it follows from our proof that theorem [ disper ] and [ disperoptimal ] holds true if one replaces @xmath83 by @xmath84 with @xmath85 .    as a consequence of and classical arguments , we obtain the following set of strichartz estimates .",

    "@xmath92 the known range of admissible indices for which sharp strichartz hold is in fact slightly larger , see @xcite .",
    "however , in larger dimensions @xmath93 , theorem [ thstri ] improves the range of indices for which sharp strichartz do hold , and does so in a uniform way with respect to dimension , in contrast to @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our results are , for now , restricted to a model case of strictly convex domain , while @xcite applies to any domain .",
    "one may use the model case analysis to extend estimates to any smooth strictly convex domain , as in the counterexample situation @xcite .",

    "this would heuristically match a @xmath94 loss in the dispersion estimate .",
    "we plan to address this issue in future work , by proving that the worst time - space points @xmath95 may be suitably averaged over .",
    "one may then make good use of such strichartz estimates for the local ( and global ) cauchy theory of nonlinear wave equations .",
    "we provide one simple example .",
    "the energy critical wave equation @xmath96 with data @xmath97 has unique global in time solutions for @xmath98 .    in the small data case",
    ", the result follows directly from the previously obtained set of strichartz estimates .",
    "appendix [ nonlin ] provides details on how to combine these new estimates with arguments from @xcite to obtain the large data case .      in @xcite",
    "the second author sketched the main steps of a proof of and gave a full description of the geometry of the wave front set . in this work",
    ", we provide a complete construction of a suitable parametrix for the wave equation , which we then utilize to obtain decay estimates by ( degenerate ) stationary phases .",
    "recall that , at time @xmath99 , one expects the wave propagating from the source of light to be highly concentrated around the sphere of radius @xmath100 . for a variable coefficients metric , one can make good of this heuristic as long as two different light rays emanating from the source do not cross : in other words , as long as @xmath100 is smaller than the injectivity radius .",
    "one may then construct parametrices using oscillatory integrals , where the phase encodes the geometry of the wave front .    in our situation ,",
    "the geometry of the wave front becomes singular in arbitrarily small times , depending on the frequency of the source and its distance to the boundary .",
    "in fact , a caustic appears right between the first and the second reflexion of the wave front , as illustrated on figure [ figprops ] and figure [ figqueues ] ( which is a zoomed version at the relevant time scale ) .",
    "therefore , we are to investigate concentration phenomena ( `` caustics '' ) that may occur near the boundary .",
    "geometrically , caustics are defined as envelopes of light rays coming from our source of light .",
    "each ray is tangent to the caustic at a given point .",
    "if one assigns a direction on the caustic , it induces a direction on each ray .",
    "each point outside the caustic ( and in the sunny side of the caustic ) lies on a ray which has left the caustic and also lies on a ray approaching the caustic .",
    "each curve of constant phase has a cusp where it meets the caustic .    at the caustic point",
    "we expect light to be singularly intense .",
    "analytically , caustics can be characterized as points were usual bounds on oscillatory integrals are no longer valid .",
    "oscillatory integrals with caustics have enjoyed much attention : their asymptotic behavior is known to be driven by the number and the order of those of their critical points which are real .",
    "let us consider an oscillatory integral    @xmath101.\\ ] ]    we assume that @xmath102 is smooth and that @xmath103 is compactly supported in @xmath104 and in @xmath105 .",
    "if there are no critical points of the map @xmath106 , so that @xmath107 everywhere in an open neighborhood of the support of @xmath103 , then repeated integration by parts ( i.e. non stationary phase ) yields that @xmath108 , for any @xmath109 .",
    "if there are non - degenerate critical points , where @xmath110 but @xmath111 , then the method of stationary phase applies and yields @xmath112 .",
    "the corresponding canonical form is a gaussian phase .",
    "if there are degenerate critical points , we define them to be caustics , as @xmath113 is no longer uniformly bounded .",
    "the order of a caustic @xmath114 is defined as the infimum of @xmath115 such that @xmath116 .",
    "the most simple degenerate phase beyond the gaussian is @xmath117 , which corresponds to a fold with order @xmath118 .",
    "a typical example is the airy function .",
    "the caustic is given by @xmath119 and the illuminated side is @xmath120 .",
    "the next canonical form is given by a phase function which is a polynomial of degree @xmath121 , namely @xmath122 whose order is @xmath123 ; its associated integral is called pearcey s function and it produces a cusp singularity on the caustic which is parametrized by @xmath124 .    finally , we conclude this brief overview with the swallowtail integral ( which is an oscillatory integral with four coalescing saddle points ) whose canonical form is given by a polynomial of degree @xmath125 , @xmath126 : the caustic surface of the swallowtail is defined by the condition that two or more _ real _ saddle points are equal : it is pictured on figure [ picswallow ] . in the event that two simple saddle points undergo confluence when @xmath127 , then the uniform asymptotic behavior of contains terms involving the airy function and its derivatives multiplied by powers of @xmath128 ; the caustic surface is smooth ( @xmath129 on the figure ) .",
    "if three simple saddles coalesce as @xmath130 , then the uniform asymptotic behavior of can be described by terms containing the pearcey function and its first - order derivatives , each multiplied by a power of @xmath131 ; the caustic surface has cusps ( two of them in the @xmath132 region on the figure ) .",
    "the swallowtail enters the picture when four simple saddle points of undergo confluence as @xmath130 ( which is @xmath133 on the figure ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a very nice presentation , both from the mathematical and the physical point of vue , of degenerate oscillatory integrals and their relation to thom s theory of catastrophes .",
    "such integrals will play a crucial role in the proof of theorem [ disper ] . between two consecutive reflections of the wave propagating along the boundary",
    ", we shall construct a parametrix of the form @xmath134 where the phase is essentially @xmath135 , with @xmath136 , @xmath137 is the fourier variable associated to the tangential variable @xmath51 and @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the fourier variable associated to the normal variable @xmath140 .",
    "note we may restrict to @xmath141 which corresponds precisely to waves propagating along the boundary and explains the @xmath142 parametrization for the oscillatory integral . for a particular value @xmath143 of @xmath136",
    ", this phase will have a saddle point of order @xmath121 ; it corresponds to @xmath144 and @xmath145 : the geometric picture is that of a swallowtail singularity , but the decay loss is that of the pearcey s integral , i.e. @xmath146 . for @xmath147 , our oscillatory integral will have only critical points of order at most @xmath148 , corresponding to @xmath149 and @xmath150 : the picture is , at worst , that of cusps and the loss is that of the airy function , i.e. @xmath151 .",
    "finally , we notice figures [ picswallow ] and [ figqueues ] picture the same singularity formation : in [ picswallow ] , up to translations , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 ; @xmath129 corresponds to the ( smooth ) refocusing wave front in the left part of [ figqueues ] while two cusps form on the right part after the swallowtail singularity .",
    "let us mention the main ideas of the proof of theorem [ disper ] .",
    "first , we may reduce to the two dimensional case , as the tangential directions will produce the usual decay factor when we integrate them out , see section [ dim3 ] .",
    "let @xmath56 $ ] be a small parameter ( @xmath155 will later be the spectral frequency ) and @xmath156 the distance of the source to the boundary .",
    "we assume @xmath64 to be small as we are interested in highly reflected waves , which we do not observe if the waves do not have time to reach the boundary .    from the spectral analysis which will be recalled in section [ wgm ]",
    ", we have an explicit representation for the green function associated to the half - wave initial value problem with a dirac at @xmath157 as initial condition at time @xmath158 : @xmath159 where @xmath160 , with @xmath161 a zero of the airy function and the @xmath162 are explicit , real - valued functions which are defined in section [ wgm ] .",
    "we now record several remarks that will be of help later and relate to various phase space localizations .",
    "[ remspectal ] we may perform a spectral localization at @xmath163 , which corresponds to inserting a smooth , compactly supported away from zero @xmath164 ; on the flow , this is nothing but @xmath165 and this smoothes out the green function .",
    "then we are dealing with a semi - classical boundary value problem with small parameter @xmath26 . with the usual notations @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , the characteristic set of our operator",
    "is given by @xmath169 the hyperbolic ( resp .",
    "elliptic ) subset of the cotangent bundle of the boundary @xmath170 is @xmath171 , ( resp .",
    "@xmath172 ) and the gliding subset is @xmath173 . from @xmath174 ,",
    "one gets at the symbolic level on the micro - support of any gallery mode associated to @xmath175 ( see section [ wgm ] for a definition of gallery modes ) @xmath176    [ remspectraly ] we may also localize with @xmath177 , with @xmath1780,\\infty[)$ ] , which correspond to a fourier localization along the tangential ( i.e. @xmath51 ) direction ( notice such a truncation is easily seen to commute with the equation , hence the flow ) . since we are not interested with waves transverse to the boundary , we may and will assume that on the support of @xmath179 one has @xmath180 with @xmath181 small .",
    "this is compatible with since @xmath182 and @xmath180 is equivalent to @xmath183 .",
    "this fact will later have its importance when @xmath67 .",

    "hence , it can be dealt with as in @xcite to get the free space decay and we will ignore it in the upcoming analysis .",
    "[ symax ] finally , the symmetry of @xmath186 ( or its suitable spectral truncations ) with respect to @xmath140 and @xmath64 will be of great importance : it allows us to restrict the computation of the @xmath187 norm to the region @xmath188 .",
    "now , we consider initial data @xmath189 where the @xmath190 are those of remark [ remspectraly ] .",
    "we will use different arguments depending on the respective position of @xmath64 and @xmath26 .",
    "the first case is @xmath191 : there , we follow ideas of @xcite and write a parametrix for the wave equation as a superposition of localized waves for which we can compute the wave front set and hence the singularities that appear at different times and locations .",
    "the construction of @xcite has to be significantly altered to allow for the range @xmath192 , with a phase which is less explicit but prevents amplifying factors at each reflexion that induced the @xmath193 restriction in @xcite .",
    "the second case corresponds to data for which the distance @xmath64 to the boundary is such that @xmath194 : we write the contribution of our data which is localized in a @xmath146 cone of tangential directions as the @xmath195 orthogonal sum of whispering gallery modes and prove that after a time @xmath100 the corresponding wave remains frequency localized in the same cone of directions of size @xmath146 , at least up to smooth remainders . while not quite as strong as a microlocal propagation of singularities result , this allows for the use of sobolev embedding theorem to recover the `` dispersion '' by using the size of the fourier support .",
    "the contribution of data corresponding to directions with angles with the boundary greater than @xmath146 may be dealt with separately , using a crude parametrix construction , as they involve only cusp - type singularities .",
    "notice that there is an overlap between the two regions : in fact the parametrix construction obviously provides better bounds in the overlap region , both in size ( we gain an @xmath80 factor in the worst case ) and position ( the swallowtail occurs exactly once in between two consecutive reflexions ) .",
    "had we reproduced the parametrix construction from @xcite , we would have an epsilon loss in the dispersion estimate because of the @xmath196 region .",
    "we thought it was of independent interest to quantify how `` far '' below @xmath197 the construction could be pushed while retaining the most interesting features of @xcite .",
    "figure [ figprops ] illustrates the propagation of ( part of ) the wavefront set of the dirac data ; the second picture is a zoomed version of the first one and shows in detail the formation of the swallowtail singularity for the part of the wave front moving along directions which are initially tangent to the boundary .",
