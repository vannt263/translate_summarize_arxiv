    "the study of the @xmath18/cft correspondence @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) has taught us much about both the behavior of field theories and the nature of string theory .",
    "accordingly , generalizations of the correspondence with additional structure added to both sides are inherently quite interesting , and potentially have much more to teach us about field theory dynamics , the nature of string theory and how holography relates them .",
    "it is well - known that spatial defects may be introduced into conformal field theories , reducing the total symmetry but preserving conformal invariance @xcite . whether one can obtain holographic duals of such `` defect conformal field theories '' ( dcfts ) is a fascinating question .",
    "a potential gravity dual was proposed by karch and randall @xcite , who studied curved branes in anti - de sitter space in an effort to `` locally localize '' gravity @xcite .    in their investigation ,",
    "karch and randall noticed that an @xmath19 brane inside @xmath20 could be naturally realized in string theory using a certain d3-brane / d5-brane system .",
    "the near - horizon limit of the @xmath10 d3-branes produces an @xmath21 background in which the d5-branes occupy an @xmath1 submanifold .",
    "karch and randall speculated that the @xmath18/cft correspondence would `` act twice '' in this system , meaning that in addition to the closed strings propagating throughout space providing a holographic description of a field theory on the boundary of @xmath20 as usual , the fluctuations on the @xmath19 brane should be dual to additional physics confined to the boundary of the @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the dual field theory contains not only the usual @xmath22 super - yang mills theory , but also new fields and couplings living on a @xmath23-dimensional defect , obtained from the low - energy limit of the 3 - 5 open strings interacting with the 3 - 3 strings of the original brane setup .",
    "we study the case of a single d5-brane , whose backreaction on the near - horizon geometry can be neglected in the t hooft limit , allowing it to be treated as a probe hosting open strings .",
    "the resulting dual field theory consists of @xmath24 @xmath25 sym in * r*@xmath26 , with a subset of these ambient modes interacting in a fashion we will determine with a single fundamental hypermultiplet on the * r*@xmath27 defect .",
    "the resulting theory has half the supersymmetry of the ambient theory , but intriguingly , must preserve @xmath28 conformal symmetry in order to match the unbroken anti - de sitter isometries on the gravity side . as a result",
    "the karch - randall system is an ideal candidate for the holographic description of a dcft .",
    "we will construct the field theory explicitly as a novel defect superconformal theory with an exact lagrangian description .",
    "the reduced symmetries of codimension - one dcfts admit interesting structures such as one - point functions for the usual operators in the ambient space , two - point functions for ambient operators with different conformal dimensions , and mixed two - point functions between these and operators localized on the defect ; the functional forms of such correlators are significantly constrained @xcite . on the supergravity side , we employ holography to calculate such novel correlation functions from witten diagrams involving integrals over the @xmath19 submanifold , and we reproduce the space - time forms required by defect conformal symmetry .",
    "we consider the expansion of the d5-brane action through quadratic order in fluctuations about the @xmath1 probe configuation .",
    "we perform a kaluza - klein reduction of quadratic terms in bosonic open string fields @xmath29 and find a set of modes of integer mass and scale dimension .",
    "the lowest mode of the d5-brane gauge field on @xmath19 is dual to the current of a global @xmath30 symmetry in the field theory .",
    "as expected all modes can be organized in short representations of the superalgebra @xmath6 associated with supersymmetry in @xmath19 .",
    "other terms in the fluctuation action involve closed string fields @xmath31 , specifically terms of order @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "these are interpreted as interactions which determine the novel correlators discussed above .",
    "we also obtain the leading power of @xmath10 and the t hooft coupling @xmath34 for the d5-brane contribution to all correlation functions , a strong - coupling prediction .",
    "we then turn to the dual dscft . using gauge invariance , supersymmetry and r - symmetry ,",
    "we construct the field theory lagrangian .",
    "this involves augmenting the usual @xmath25 super yang - mills in four dimensions with dynamics on the defect .",
    "the fundamental defect hypermultiplet couples canonically to the restriction of the 4d gauge field to the hypersurface ; we use the `` superspace boundary '' technique @xcite to derive a defect action preserving eight supercharges .",
    "we construct the action in @xmath35 superspace , but demonstrate that it is fully @xmath25 supersymmetric by identifying the @xmath36 r - symmetry .",
    "the symmetries rule out any additional marginal interactions , preserving the 4d gauge coupling @xmath37 as the only dimensionless parameter , as well as forbidding mass terms , leaving the theory classically conformal - invariant .",
    "interestingly , the bulk fields participating in the defect interaction involve not just half the scalars , but the normal derivatives of the other half .",
    "the bosonic parts of related ( non - conformal ) supersymmetric defect actions derived from intersecting branes appeared in @xcite .",
    "we also match the bosonic modes of the d5-brane on the gravity side to dual field theory operators .",
    "the multiplets are short , so conformal dimensions should be protected in the usual way .",
    "there is a unique candidate for the chiral primary operator of the lowest multiplet , and we use supersymmetry to fill out the rest of this multiplet , matching the modes to fluctuations on the gravity side .",
    "we also discuss the operator structure of higher multiplets .",
    "weak coupling calculations help to determine which operators have protected scale dimensions .    finally , we discuss the perturbative dynamics of the field theory .",
    "we argue that for a certain class of `` pinned '' correlators , there are no divergences other than wavefunction renormalization of the defect fields .",
    "this is sufficient to demonstrate quantum conformal invariance for gauge group @xmath12 . for gauge group @xmath24 non - pinned correlators",
    "must be considered as well , and we have not yet studied these .",
    "hence the question of quantum conformal invariance remains open .",
    "we also discuss the field theory computation of various one- and two - point functions , and compare to gravity .",
    "we find that although the powers of @xmath10 match perfectly , the powers of the t hooft parameter do not . hence , unlike the @xmath25 case , the simplest correlators of this theory do not obey a nonrenormalization theorem .",
    "we do describe a class of correlators independent of @xmath34 at leading order , for which a non - renormalization theorem is not ruled out .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of directions for future research .",
    "one can consider analogous models in other dimensions .",
    "defect conformal field theories in two dimensions are studied in @xcite .",
    "some of them have holographic duals in @xmath38 , such as the @xmath39 branes inside @xmath38 with the ns - ns flux studied in @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "one may be able to study the correspondence beyond the supergravity approximation .",
    "sections [ fieldsec ] and [ perturbsec ] on the construction and analysis of the field theory are largely independent of holography and can be read separately .",
    "the system of partially - overlapping 3-branes and 5-branes preserving 8 supercharges has been known for some time , and was extensively studied in @xcite as a way to engineer 3-dimensional @xmath25 field theories on branes . in contrast , we consider systems which have infinite d3-branes , and hence have four - dimensional ( as well as three - dimensional ) dynamics .",
    "we choose coordinates as follows .",
    "the @xmath10 d3-branes fill the 0126 directions , while the d5-brane spans 012345 ; all the branes sit at the origin of the transverse coordinates . in the absence of the d5-brane",
    ", the system has 16 unbroken supercharges , an @xmath40 lorentz symmetry acting on @xmath41 and an additional @xmath42 acting on @xmath43 .",
    "the d3-d5 background preserves 8 supersymmetries , reduces @xmath40 to @xmath44 on @xmath45 , and breaks @xmath46 to @xmath47 acting on @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "four kinds of strings exist in this system . as usual ,",
    "closed strings propagate in the bulk , giving rise to the fields of iib sugra as well as all the excited modes . also ,",
    "3 - 3 and 5 - 5 open strings lead to sixteen - supercharge vector multiplets on the d3-brane and d5-brane , respectively ; these each split into a vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet under the preserved eight supercharges .",
    "finally , 3 - 5 strings localized on the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional intersection of the branes lead to a three - dimensional hypermultiplet , charged as a bifundamental under the gauge group of each brane .",
    "we remind the reader of the familiar facts of the original @xmath18/cft procedure of maldacena @xcite . consider a stack of @xmath10 parallel d3-branes with @xmath50 , @xmath51 with @xmath52 fixed .",
    "this system may be examined either for @xmath53 , in which case the appropriate description is provided by open strings propagating on flat branes , or for @xmath54 , in which case the appropriate description is a black three - brane solution of type iib supergravity . by sending @xmath55 with the energies of fluctuations fixed ,",
    "one is left in the former case with the renormalizable field theory of the massless open string states , namely 4d @xmath25 super - yang mills , and with closed strings propagating in the @xmath21 near - horizon geometry of the black brane in the latter case .",
    "thus , the two kinds of string modes in the original brane set - up , open and closed , have been segregated from one another , yet are found to describe the same physics in the field theory / near - horizon limit .",
    "each description is useful in a different region of parameter space .",
    "additionally , the symmetry groups enlarge on both sides in the limit , as the field theory is exactly ( super)conformal , while @xmath18 isometries appear on the gravity side ; the 4d conformal and 5d anti - de sitter supergroups are algebraically identical , and are denoted @xmath56 .",
    "this group also contains the @xmath42 of the original brane setup , which is an r - symmetry in the field theory and the isometry group of @xmath57 in the dual .",
    "the system we study is richer , but displays similar behavior .",
    "again we take @xmath58 , @xmath59 with @xmath60 fixed . for the case",
    "@xmath53 , the appropriate description of the branes are as flat hypersurfaces .",
    "we take the limit @xmath55 with the energies of d3-brane fluctuations fixed .",
    "this decouples the modes of the heavy d5-branes , as in @xcite , and leads to the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional field theory described by @xmath25 sym throughout most of the space , but with a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional defect containing a localized , interacting fundamental hypermultiplet .    for @xmath54 , on the other hand",
    ", the appropriate description of the d3-branes is a black three - brane .",
    "however , we still have @xmath61 , and hence a single d5-brane should still be described as a hypersurface with propagating open strings . taking the @xmath62 limit here",
    "leads to the usual @xmath21 near - horizon geometry of d3-branes with an embedded `` probe '' d5-brane .",
    "d5-branes with @xmath63 , a different regime from our case @xcite .",
    "other studies of @xmath64 setups with strong backreaction include @xcite .",
    "] once again the stringy modes of the brane set - up have been segregated into two sets , one for each limit of @xmath65 : the closed strings and open 5 - 5 strings describe the gravity side , while the low - energy limit of the 3 - 3 and 3 - 5 open strings produces the field theory . once again , the expectation is that the two systems are holographic duals of one another .",
    "we may readily see that the d5-brane lives on an @xmath1 submanifold of @xmath21 , as follows . in the near - horizon geometry of the d3-branes ,",
    "the useful coordinates are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and the radial coordinate @xmath68 and the angles @xmath69 defined by @xmath70 the metric for the near - horizon geometry in this coordinate system is @xmath71 where as usual @xmath72 .",
    "the d5-brane sits at @xmath73 , filling the @xmath19 defined by the coordinates @xmath68 , @xmath74 and wrapping the @xmath75 parameterized by @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",

    "is the unbroken r - symmetry and @xmath28 is the 3d conformal group , suggesting that the dual field theory must be exactly conformal and contain the eight preserved supercharges of the d3-d5 system . including the superconformal enehancement to sixteen supercharges",
    ", we expect to find the supergroup @xmath6 .",
    "the symmetries and the form of correlation functions for cft@xmath85 with planar boundary have been discussed in the literature , for example in @xcite .",
    "our field theory system , a cft@xmath86 in @xmath3 with additional fields on a planar @xmath4 defect , shares these features .",
    "we therefore review the most relevant part of this information , which is mostly taken from @xcite .    in the field theory description we denote points of @xmath3 by @xmath87 with the defect at @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath28 conformal group of the dcft is generated by 3-dimensional translations and lorentz transformations together with the 4-dimensional inversion , @xmath89 .",
    "these transformations preserve the defect and act on it as standard 3-dimensional conformal transformations .",
    "the possible forms of correlation functions for primary scalar operators @xmath90 on the ambient @xmath91 and @xmath7 on the defect are restricted by the conformal symmetry .",
    "correlators involving only @xmath7 have the properties expected from standard 3-dimensional conformal invariance , e.g.  the space - time form of two- and three - point functions is completely determined , while four - point functions contain an arbitrary function of two `` cross - ratio '' variables .    on the other hand the restriction of the conventional conformal group @xmath92 of cft@xmath86 to @xmath28 leads to new possibilities for correlators of @xmath90 in dcft .",
    "let scale dimensions of operators @xmath90 and @xmath7 be denoted by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "there are non - vanishing one - point functions @xmath95 , with fully determined space - time dependence : @xmath96 as well as two - point functions @xmath97 between one ambient and one defect operator , with space - time dependence also fully determined : @xmath98 and finally there can be non - vanishing two - point functions @xmath99 between ambient operators with @xmath100 , containing an arbitrary function of one invariant variable : @xmath101 our calculations in both weak coupling field theory and the @xmath102 dual confirm this structure .    on the gravity side",
    "the action of the conformal symmetries is best seen if we transform the radial coordinate @xmath68 to @xmath103 , in terms of which the @xmath20 metric ( [ adsmetric ] ) becomes conformally flat , @xmath104 the boundary is now at @xmath105 .",
    "the usual inversion isometry of @xmath20 preserves both the boundary and the @xmath19 of the d5-brane at @xmath88 .",
    "it acts as the standard inversion on this @xmath19 .",

    "surfaces at @xmath106 and acts as the standard inversion on these surfaces . ]",
    "the bulk degrees of freedom at @xmath50 , @xmath65 fixed but large include both closed string modes , and open string excitations on the d5-brane .",
    "the former are the massless multiplet of iib sugra reduced on @xmath21 , while the latter are a 6d 16-supercharge vector multiplet living on the d5 , dimensionally reduced on @xmath1 .    with the goal of calculating correlation functions , we are interested in the fluctuation equations of this system .",
    "the total action is the sum of the iib sugra action and the born - infeld and wess - zumino pieces of the d5-brane action : @xmath107 the fluctuation equations for iib sugra reduced on @xmath21 were analyzed in @xcite , and they have been used extensively to calculate correlations for gauge - invariant operators @xmath90 in @xmath25 sym at large @xmath34 ( for a review and references , see @xcite ) .",
    "these results will generically be corrected in our system due to the new physics on the defect , and we expect new correlators of the form ( [ one ] ) , ( [ correctedtwo ] ) to appear . on the gravity side , this is a consequence of couplings of closed - string modes to brane modes that are implicit in @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , terms in the brane action involving open string modes and open / closed string couplings make predictions for purely three - dimensional correlators of the @xmath7 , as well as mixed correlators involving both @xmath7 and @xmath90 , which we expect to match for example ( [ mixed ] ) .",
    "let us compare the normalizations of the terms in ( [ totalaction ] ) to understand the relative coupling strength of the various kinds of interaction .",
    "the overall normalization of @xmath110 in einstein frame is @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 includes factors of the string coupling extracted from the dilaton before passing to einstein frame . in calculating correlation functions ,",

    "we use @xmath120 for the coordinates along the 5-brane , @xmath121 for the normal directions , and @xmath122 to run over all 10 indices .",

    "weyl - rescaling the metric in @xmath108 , we will find @xmath125 where we used the expression @xmath126 for the d5-brane tension , and @xmath127 includes the numerical factors .",
    "let us imagine a generic d5-brane field @xmath128 and some coupling of @xmath129 bulk generic fields @xmath130 to @xmath131 5-brane fields : @xmath132 where we defined a canonically normalized brane field @xmath133 .",
    "the interaction terms resulting from @xmath109 scales identically in @xmath10 and @xmath34 .",

    "the one - point function of the bulk field @xmath134 scales as @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) and the two - point function of the bulk field and the defect field scales as @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "holography requires that the power of @xmath10 in the gravity result for any correlator agree with that of planar graphs in the field theory at fixed @xmath34 . on the other hand the power of @xmath34 from ( [ couplings ] ) at large @xmath140 need not agree with field theory results at weak coupling .",
    "it is quite easy to see in the present case that the @xmath10-dependence always agrees but the @xmath34-dependence generically does not .",
    "the agreement for @xmath10 can best be ascertained in the normalizations of ( [ niib ] ) and ( [ biweyl ] ) in which we have the factor @xmath141 in @xmath110 and @xmath10 in @xmath108 .",
    "all correlators @xmath142 which are non - vanishing if the defect is removed are of leading order @xmath141 , while contributions of @xmath108 are of order @xmath10 in all correlators .",

    "planar graphs with only adjoint fields are of order @xmath141 , while in those with defect fields there is a fundamental `` quark '' loop which matches the @xmath10 in ( [ biweyl ] ) .",
    "the power of @xmath34 for multi - point correlators is generically a negative fraction , and it is clear that perturbative field theory gives non - negative integer powers in the weak coupling limit .",
    "this situation is entirely consistent with the view that @xmath18/cft amplitudes sum all planar graphs at large fixed @xmath34 , but it also indicates that the non - renormalization properties of correlation functions in @xmath25 sym which were revealed through supergravity @xcite are absent for generic defect correlators - dependence of @xmath95 and recognized it could not obey a non - renormalization theorem .",
    "we thank them for communicating their results . ] .",
    "correlation functions with @xmath147 and any @xmath129 , however , are seen from ( [ couplings ] ) to be independent of @xmath34 .",
    "this includes defect 2-point functions @xmath148 and others which behave as @xmath149 at weak coupling .",
    "non - renormalization theorems could exist for this class of correlators",
    ".    one can use ( [ couplings ] ) to compute correlation functions of defect and ambient operators @xmath7 and @xmath90 for a generic boundary dcft .",
    "the one - point function @xmath150 is computed by taking the standard bulk - boundary propagator in @xmath20 , fixing a point on the boundary where @xmath90 is located , and integrating the propagator over the @xmath19 subspace .",
    "let us consider a scalar @xmath90 of conformal weight @xmath93 .",
    "the integral is convergent for @xmath151 , and one finds @xmath152 by translational invariance along the defect , the one - point function depends only on the transverse coordinate @xmath153 .",
    "the scaling @xmath154 is what is expected from conformal invariance ( [ one ] ) .",
    "we will discuss the the singularity at @xmath155 shortly .",
    "the one - point function @xmath156 is closely related to the two - point function @xmath157 in the conventional @xmath158/cft@xmath85 correspondence .",
    "it is known @xcite that a naive supergravity computation for the latter is incorrect and that a careful cutoff procedure is required .",
    "one may thus be worried about a similar sensitivity in the computation of @xmath150 . however , there is reason to believe that this is not the case here , and that ( [ onepoint ] ) is in fact the correct answer .",
    "one way to see this is to recall that for the two - point function , each of the two contributing terms from the action was separately divergent , and so a more careful treatment of the dirichlet problem was required to extract the proper finite result @xcite .",
    "here there is no such divergence in the single term contributing to the one - point function .",
    "alternately , a worldsheet way to understand the subtlety in the computation of the two - point function follows from trying to perform the calculation in string theory , which is well - defined for @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "there one considers a two - point function of the corresponding vertex operators on a sphere and divides the result by the volume of the worldsheet conformal symmetry which fixes the two insertion points .",
    "the volume of this residual conformal symmetry is infinite , and it is canceled by another infinity in the numerator from the worldsheet two - point function .",
    "thus again the computation of the target space correlator involves cancellation of two divergent factors , which may leave out a finite @xmath160-dependent coefficient ; in fact the proper treatment of this computation has been shown to give the correct factor for @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "however , there is no corresponding subtlety in the computation of the one point function @xmath95 , since the volume of the residual conformal symmetry of a disk with one interior point fixed is finite .",
    "hence we expect ( [ onepoint ] ) to be unambiguous and correct .    for the two - point function @xmath161 ,",
    "the integral to be done is the product of bulk - boundary propagators @xmath162 , with the first as above and the second propagating from the point @xmath163 on @xmath19 to the point @xmath164 on its boundary . we write @xmath165 with the integral @xmath166",
    "as explained in @xcite , it is convenient to use the inversion @xmath167 to do the integral , which leads to @xmath168 after scaling @xmath169 and @xmath170 , one finds @xmath171 the conformal invariant form ( [ mixed ] ) thus arises from gravity .",
    "the integral converges if the conditions @xmath172 and @xmath173 are satisfied .",
    "the singularity at @xmath174 is due to a divergence as the inverted radial coordinate @xmath175 and is similar to the singularity of @xmath95 at @xmath155 .",
    "the singularity at @xmath176 arises as @xmath177 .",
    "the poles due to the @xmath178-functions in the numerators of ( [ onepoint ] ) and ( [ jint ] ) were calculated using the generic form ( [ couplings ] ) of @xmath108 . we can show that they cancel in the particular @xmath179 theory we are studying because the actual couplings vanish due to @xmath180 symmetry . for ( [ onepoint ] )",
    "the issue arises only @xmath155 , but the primary operator @xmath181 belongs to the @xmath182 irreducible representation of @xmath46 which contains no singlets under the residual r - symmetry .",
    "to discuss the poles in @xmath183 , we must anticipate one key result of the kaluza - klein analysis in the next subsection , namely that the primary operators on the defect carry @xmath184 quantum numbers @xmath185 and have scale dimension @xmath186 .",
    "thus the pole at @xmath187 in ( [ jint ] ) can appear only for @xmath188 and the lowest @xmath7 , a case which violates r - symmetry .",
    "consider next poles at @xmath189 .",
    "we need the fact that the primaries @xmath190 contain only components in the representations @xmath191 of @xmath184 .",
    "isospin conservation in @xmath192 thus requires @xmath193 or @xmath194 ; thus only the case with pole @xmath195 is allowed by r - symmetry .",
    "however , the set of poles we are discussing are close analogues of those in the 3-point function on @xmath25 sym @xmath196 studied in @xcite . in the 3-point case a large set of singular cases is forbidden by @xmath46 symmetry , and there is one remaining extremal case with @xmath197 . for this case the actual bulk couplings @xmath198 from type iib supergravity",
    "have a zero which cancels the pole leaving a finite result @xcite .",
    "the remaining singular case for @xmath183 is extremal in exactly the same sense , and we conjecture that the specific couplings that occur in the @xmath199-brane action will cancel the pole .",
    "we now turn to a more detailed study of the d5-brane action for the karch - randall system .",
    "we will enumerate all terms up to quadratic order in both open and closed string bosonic fluctuations .",
    "considering first the quadratic action for the open string modes alone , we perform a kaluza - klein reduction on the @xmath75 , producing kinetic terms for towers of @xmath19 modes .",
    "we solve for the masses of these fluctuations , and determine the conformal dimensions of the dual operators @xmath7 .",
    "as we will see , two kinds of excitation are elementary to handle , while the remaining two types are mixed and their mass matrix must be diagonalized .",
    "although there are three negative - mass modes in the full system , the breitenlohner - freedman stability bound is satisfied .",
    "all masses and conformal dimensions are nontrivially found to be integers , a sign of supersymmetry .",
    "these fluctuations fit into short multiplets of @xmath6 , and we will establish the dictionary relating them to gauge - invariant defect operators in the dual dscft in section  [ operatorsec ] .    there still remain interactions on the brane involving closed string modes . as explained in the last subsection ,",
    "these give rise to various correlation functions .",

    "this is followed by a discussion of weak coupling properties of correlation functions of composite operators which illuminate issues which arose in our discussion of the putative gravity dual .",
    "the elementary yet essential aspect of our defect theories is that certain fields of the ambient @xmath25 sym theory are `` pinned '' to the defect at @xmath88 and couple as 3-dimensional fields with scale dimension enhanced by one unit .",
    "thus for a scalar boson @xmath589 or restricted spinor @xmath590 we have the pinned propagators ( in euclidean signature ) @xmath591 whereas propagators of defect fields are @xmath592 which is relevant for correlation functions with all external operators pinned at the defect .",
    "we thus find that pinned propagators are more singular at short distance or high momentum than is standard in 3 dimensions .",
    "it is in this way that the defect theory , which would have been super - renormalizable if purely in 3 dimensions , becomes critically renormalizable with dimensionless couplings .",
    "we now outline an argument based on power counting and symmetries that conformal symmetry is maintained in perturbation theory .",
    "we will argue that , after cancellation among the graphs of fixed loop order contributing to a given 1pi amplitude , the only new divergences are those of wave function renormalization of the defect fields @xmath593 .",

    "the quartic couplings of the scalar potential in @xmath617 ( [ spot ] ) are generated from three - point couplings by eliminating auxiliary fields , and hence these are also fixed by susy and can not be renormalized .",

    "they are more divergent at short distance , and lack conventional translation symmetry .",
