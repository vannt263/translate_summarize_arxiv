    "we study the following time evolution of random graphs on @xmath1 vertices .",
    "let us denote one sample trajectory of graphs by @xmath2 , where the time @xmath3 is a real number .",
    "@xmath4 is assumed to contain @xmath5 edges that connect two vertices chosen randomly . here",
    ", @xmath6 is regarded as a control parameter of the model . when @xmath7 , a vertex is chosen with a constant rate @xmath8 for each vertex .",
    "then , if the number is less than an integer @xmath0 , all the edges incident to the vertex are deleted .",
    "this rule defines the poisson jump process @xmath9 in the set of graphs on @xmath1 vertices .",
    "we display two examples of the time evolution of graphs in fig .",
    "[ anime ] , where the random graphs are embedded in the two - dimensional space .",
    "let @xmath10 be the number of edges at time @xmath3 .",
    "obviously , when @xmath11 is sufficiently small , @xmath12 is zero with probability 1 in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "it has been known that there is a critical value of @xmath11 above which @xmath14 is finite ( nonzero ) with probability 1 in the same limit @xcite .",
    "the final graph provides the @xmath0-core ( see fig .",
    "[ anime ] ) , which is defined by the largest subgraph with minimum degree at least @xmath0 .",
    "this transition with respect to the change in @xmath11 is called the @xmath0-core percolation in a random graph .",
    "the critical value @xmath15 was calculated exactly in ref .",
    "@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     nevertheless , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we present the numerical result of random graphs on @xmath16 vertices .",
    "the square symbols represent @xmath17 and @xmath18 for several values of @xmath19 . in order to complement the numerical data",
    ", we also display the results of numerical simulations of a simple langevin equation whose local form near the marginal saddle is equivalent to ( [ veq - noise ] ) .",
    "the equation is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the noise intensity which is expected to be proportional to @xmath23 in the present problem .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to the case @xmath24 , whose value is chosen such that the square symbols are on the solid curves .",
    "then , by decreasing the noise intensity to @xmath25 , which might correspond to the @xmath0-core problem with @xmath26 , we obtain the dotted curve .",
    "as discussed theoretically , the power - law behavior of @xmath27 is observed in the regime @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is observed in the regime @xmath30 .    with regard to finite size effects , we mention that the probability of finding trajectories satisfying @xmath31 is given by a universal function of @xmath32 .",
    "this implies that the system behavior in the regime @xmath33 is qualitatively different from that in the regime @xmath34 . theoretically , in order to describe the crossover around @xmath35 , we need to analyze ( [ langevinz ] ) , not ( [ veq - noise ] ) .",
    "when we are interested in the relaxation behavior , we should focus on the regime @xmath36 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that @xmath37 exhibits the simpler behavior than @xmath18 .",
    "we therefore conjecture that @xmath37 is a more fundamental quantity than @xmath38 .",
    "we also mention that the critical behavior of exit time from a marginal saddle is observed in a coupled oscillator model @xcite related to neuronal avalanches @xcite .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "it is an interesting subject to find other examples belonging to the same universality class .",
    "although the @xmath0-core percolation is not directly related to jamming transitions , our results might provide a suggestion for future studies on jamming transition .",
    "as one example of such a study , we may theoretically consider the numerical result obtained for the jamming transition in the frederic - andersen model in a random graph @xcite , because the @xmath0-core percolation dynamics is regarded as an irreversible version of a kinetic constraint model . as another direction of study",
    ", one may analyze fluctuations of exit time in more general jamming systems .",
    "the important example is the application to the spherical @xmath39-spin glass model , for which the mode coupling theory is believed to be exact @xcite .",
    "since the transition described by this theory is interpreted as a variant of saddle - node bifurcation @xcite , we might discuss the divergent behavior of the so - called nonlinear susceptibility @xmath40 on the basis of the exit time from the plateau regime .",
    "finally , we consider the @xmath0-core percolation in finite dimensional systems . in general",
    ", one may conjecture that a transition is smeared in a manner similar to bootstrap percolation problems @xcite .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for attempts of studying the @xmath0-core percolation in finite dimensional systems . ) from our viewpoint , as the first stage of a study on finite dimensional systems , we should identify the upper - critical dimension @xmath41 for a diffusively coupled model of a simple stochastic system undergoing a saddle - node bifurcation . with regard to this problem",
    ", we point out that @xmath42 might be related to the exponent @xmath43 that characterizes the divergence of the length scale as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the next stage of studying finite dimensional systems , we should consider an equivalence or inequivalence between such a coupled model and the @xmath0-core percolation dynamics in a finite dimensional lattice .",
    "the analysis developed in the present study may be useful in this consideration .",
    "the authors express special thanks to g. biroli for his suggestion that the dynamics of @xmath0-core percolation in a random graph may be related to a saddle - node bifurcation .",
