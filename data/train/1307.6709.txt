    "several bands , all of which are traveling to the same direction , appear .",
    "occasionally ( not always ) the largest band splits into two due to large fluctuations in the tail part and the separated smaller one begins to travel to the opposite direction .",
    "because of the periodic boundary conditions , these two bands get head - on collision and after each collision , the smaller band tends to grow in its size .",
    "therefore these two bands become a comparable size eventually .",
    "the results shown below are the behavior obtained asymptotically in time .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot ] displays the snapshots just before and after collision .",
    "the orientational order in a band is destroyed transiently upon collision but there is a sharp front where the density changes steeply as can be seen in figs .",

    "we have checked that the two bands do not change their shape and speed appreciably even after seven consecutive collisions .",
    "one can see the tendency that the velocity of the bands is accelerated just after collision and then it becomes constant as the two bands are separated apart .",
    "we have observed preservation of traveling bands upon collision for @xmath701.1 and 1.3 so far .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , chat _ et al .",
    "_ have shown reflection of a traveling band at the system boundary by imposing elastic collision between the point particles and the boundary .",
    "we emphasize that what we have found above has no relation with this because there are no rooms of elastic collisions in our system since the dynamics are dissipative with deformability of each particle .",

    "we have investigated the order - disorder transitions of deformable self - propelled particles with repulsive interaction which contains an alignment mechanism .",
    "in particular , the migrating velocity of individual particles depends on the local density such that the velocity increases as the local density is increased .",
    "traveling band structures appear in the ordered state in the vicinity of the order - disorder transitions .",
    "both the density profile and the velocity profile are steep at the front and there is a plateau region followed by an exponential decay in the rear .",
    "the reason as to why band structures appear when the velocity is an increasing function of the local density can be understood qualitatively as follow .",
    "let us suppose formation of a locally high density region due to fluctuations",
    ". since the traveling velocity is higher in the region , the particles are further elongated and this enhances the orientational order in that region .",
    "the particles catch up the slowly moving particles in front whereas the alingment effect is weaker for the particles in the rear where the density is lower since the front velocity is larger than that of each particle .",
    "when the high density region grows up to the system size , it constitutes a traveling band because of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , increase of the traveling velocity as the local density is increased is favorable for formation of stable traveling bands .",
    "if the local density dependence on the migration velocity is absent , formation of traveling bands is quite rare @xcite .",
    "inverse bands are possible only for extremely large system .",
    "this is because our model system has a repulsive interaction which tends to make the system uniform in density .",
    "furthermore , deformability of individual particles prevents from alignment compared to the system of rigid rod particles .    as a remarkable property",
