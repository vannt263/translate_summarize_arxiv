    ", however , the molecular chaos assumption becomes questionable .",
    "in addition , the interactions may no longer be approximated by the instantaneous collisions but enduring contacts take place around the random closed packing fraction .",
    "the comprehensive granular rheology including the rather complicated dense regime has not been established yet .    during the last several years",
    ", careful experiments and large - scale molecular dynamics simulations have been done on the dense granular flows  @xcite .",
    "one of the important model systems that has been intensively studied is the steady flow down a slope under the gravity , where we can control the ratio of the shear stress @xmath0 to the normal stress @xmath1 by changing the inclination angle @xmath2 . in this system",
    ", it has been found that the packing fraction @xmath3 in the bulk of the flow is constant and is determined solely by the inclination angle @xmath2 ; in other words , @xmath3 is independent of the total flow hight @xmath4 and/or the roughness of the slope  @xcite .",
    "this interesting feature has been qualitatively understood by using _ the bagnold scaling _",
    "@xcite , which states the shear stress @xmath0 is proportional to the square of the shear rate @xmath5 : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the particle mass , and @xmath8 is the particle diameter .",
    "this scaling can be understood by dimensional analysis of the rigid granular flow , where the inverse of the shear rate @xmath9 is the only time scale in the system .",
    "this scaling applies to the normal stress @xmath1 also , which gives @xmath10 in the slope flow under gravity , the force balance gives @xmath11 .",
    "thus we finally have @xmath12 i.e. , the packing fraction @xmath3 is determined by the inclination angle @xmath2 .",
    "this dimensional analysis does not hold when the time scales other than @xmath9 come into the problem , e.g. the time scales of the particle deformation  @xcite , but not only the constant density profile but also the bagnold scaling itself has been found in the numerical simulations of dense steady flow down a slope for hard enough particles  @xcite .    in the slope flow simulations ,",
    "the value of the packing fraction @xmath3 has been shown to increase upon decreasing the inclination angle @xmath2 , and eventually the flow stops at a finite angle @xmath13 ; namely , @xmath14 is an decreasing function of @xmath3 in the dense region  @xcite .",

    "in contrast with the rather good agreement for the stresses , it has been found that the kinetic theory overestimate the energy dissipation rate @xmath16 , and this discrepancy is responsible for the contradicting behavior in the kinetic theory , i.e. @xmath14 increases with the packing fraction @xmath3 .",
    "the authors conjectured that the discrepancy in the energy dissipation rate @xmath16 should be caused by the velocity correlations enhanced by the inelastic collisions ; the decrease of the relative normal velocity through the inelastic collisions results in reduction of the energy loss per collision .",
