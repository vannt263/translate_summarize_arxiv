    "for metrology with atomic spins , the spin - projection - noise - limited sensitivity scales as the square root of the spin relaxation time @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for thermal vapors in closed containers , collisions with the cell walls typically destroy atomic spin after just one bounce .",
    "an early solution to this problem was to fill cells with high densities of a gas with very low polarizability , such as noble gases , which prevent atoms from reaching the cell walls over diffusion - limited times on the order of seconds @xcite .",
    "however , in these so - called buffer - gas cells , spin relaxation still occurs via spin - destruction collisions with the noble gas species , and ensemble dephasing can reduce sensitivity when magnetic field gradients are present",
    ".    early work on optical pumping led to the striking realization that if the walls of an alkali - metal vapor cell were coated with paraffin ( hydrocarbon chains , @xmath3 ) , the atomic polarization relaxed at a much slower rate @xcite . shortly thereafter , vapor cell technology improved to the point where cells with high - quality paraffin coatings enabled polarized alkali atoms to bounce between the cell walls up to 10,000 times before they depolarized @xcite .",
    "these early reports of the remarkable qualities of paraffin have led to widespread application of coated cells in areas where long - lived atomic polarization is desired  for example , in optical magnetometers @xcite , quantum memories @xcite , and atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "measurements with paraffin - coated cells without buffer gas are relatively immune to small magnetic field gradients and currently hold the record for the longest alkali - vapor spin relaxation times  up to one minute for rb atoms at near - zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "while paraffin - coated cells have been used for over half a century , the micro - chemistry of the surface coatings has only recently been explored @xcite , and the atomic depolarization mechanisms in these cells @xcite are still not fully understood . in a simple model of an evacuated alkali vapor cell at room temperature ,",
    "the two dominant sources of depolarization are due to atom - atom `` spin - exchange '' collisions and atom - wall collisions .",
    "recently , evidence for unexplained additional relaxation due to `` electron spin - randomization '' collisions has been observed for rb , cs , and k in paraffin - coated vapor cells @xcite .",
    "understanding additional sources of relaxation is especially important in light of the discovery of new cell coatings which operate at higher temperatures ( corresponding to higher vapor density ) @xcite and the very recent advent of a new coating which enables nearly one million bounces before depolarization @xcite .    in this article",
    "we examine whether gaseous impurities , of which homonuclear diatomic molecules ( dimers ) are the most abundant , are a substantial source of atomic - spin relaxation in paraffin - coated cells . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the `` electron spin - randomization '' collisions were shown to contribute @xmath4 to the atomic magnetic resonance linewidths at @xmath5c . for collisions with dimers to explain such an effect , the dimer density would have to be approximately four orders of magnitude greater than the thermodynamic equilibrium density , assuming an atom - dimer electron spin - randomization cross section on the order of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "as dimer formation involves a three - body collision most likely to occur near a surface ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , hypotheses were formulated that paraffin might catalyze formation of dimers resulting in vapor densities greatly exceeding those expected for a non - interacting vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we measured the relative dimer and atom densities in both coated and uncoated cells in order to test for these possible effects .",
    "the detection of dimers in paraffin - coated cells presents a significant technical challenge , as the melting temperature of paraffin is @xmath7c @xcite , corresponding to a dimer density of @xmath8 ( typical molecular spectroscopy experiments are performed in the range @xmath9c where dimer number densities are between @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 @xcite ) . at such low temperatures , optical absorption",
    "is highly suppressed , as the dimer population is spread over many ro - vibrational levels , so we used fluorescence to measure dimer density . by using frequency - modulation techniques we achieved a sensitivity to dimer number densities of @xmath13 after one minute of averaging , and were therefore able to operate at low enough temperatures to avoid melting the coating",
    "the law of mass action , when applied to a gas of element , x , in a closed cell reveals that the thermodynamic equilibrium condition is @xmath14 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath15 is the total number of gas - phase particles and @xmath16 is the single - particle partition function . if we can assume that the particles do not interact with each other or the cell walls , then , for alkali atoms in the ground state ( electronic angular momentum @xmath17 ) , the sum over all momentum and internal states gives a number - density ratio of : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the atomic mass , @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath21 is the ambient temperature , @xmath22 is the nuclear spin , and the brackets refer to number density .",
    "@xmath23 is the sum over internal dimer states given by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rotational constant , @xmath26 is the vibrational constant , and @xmath27 is the dissociation energy for the ground electronic molecular state @xcite .",
    "this ratio depends only on spectroscopic constants and temperature , and is therefore a cell - geometry invariant measure which can be compared to the observed vapor density .",
    "three cylindrical ( 1.7 cm length , 2.0 cm diameter ) isotopically - enriched ( more than @xmath28 ) @xmath29rb vapor cells were used , labeled p1 , b1 , and p2 ( the p stands for paraffin and b for buffer gas ) .",
    "cells p1 and p2 were paraffin - coated cells prepared following the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , while b1 was an uncoated cell containing 3 torr of ne buffer gas . to check",
    "that the cell coatings were of high quality , spin relaxation measurements were performed using a modified `` relaxation in the dark '' technique @xcite outlined in ref .",
    "these measurements revealed spin relaxation times of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for p1 , p2 , and b1 respectively @xcite , which are within the range of typical values for paraffin - coated and low pressure buffer - gas cells @xcite .",

    "holographic grating was split by a beam splitter and directed into the heated vapor cells , exciting the rb@xmath34 @xmath35 electronic transition .",
    "the excitation wavelength was chosen because it is near the band head of the @xmath35 transition , and other optical transitions , for example to the @xmath36 excited state , can be neglected . for all measurements ,",
    "the laser intensity was @xmath37 , chosen to maximize fluorescence intensity while remaining in the linear absorption regime .",
    "the laser current was modulated to produce sinusoidal frequency oscillations with a modulation depth of @xmath38 ( on the order of the doppler broadened linewidths ) and modulation frequency of 90 khz .",
    "the central frequency of the laser was scanned by a slower current ramp over a range of @xmath39 ghz ( @xmath40 ) at a repetition rate of @xmath41 .",
    "the fluorescence from each cell was collected by a lens with a collection efficiency ( percentage of total fluorescence ) of @xmath42 , spectrally filtered with an interference filter , and detected with a red - sensitive photomultiplier tube .",
    "the interference filter was tilted to transmit light at @xmath43 ( full width , half maximum ( fwhm ) 12 nm ) , which maximized the transmitted fluorescence intensity .",
    "the resulting spectra are referred to as excitation spectra throughout this manuscript .",
    "the excitation spectrum from a reference cell maintained at @xmath44 was used to stabilize the laser frequency against drifts .",
    "both signals were demodulated with lock - in amplifiers and averaged for approximately one minute with an oscilloscope .",
    "as the resulting spectra are approximately the frequency derivatives of the unmodulated spectra , they are referred to as derivative spectra here .    for temperature - dependence studies ,",
    "an oven , consisting of two high - temperature heat - tape spools and isolating cell mount , heated the cells with a variable equilibrium temperature in the range @xmath45 .",
    "two thermocouples placed at different locations near the surface of the cell monitored the temperature .",
    "the atomic vapor density was monitored by analyzing absorption of light from a @xmath46 laser which scanned across the rb d2 line .",
    "the collection efficiency for each cell was periodically measured by simultaneously recording the d2 absorption and fluorescence spectra at low temperature , using the same optical path and collection geometry as for dimer fluorescence .",
