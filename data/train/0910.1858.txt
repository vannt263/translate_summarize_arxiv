    "the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) is an important model from statistical mechanics which was introduced independently in the context of biology @xcite and in mathematics @xcite around 1970 . since then there has been a huge amount of activity on the asep and its variants for a number of reasons : although the definition of the model is quite simple , the asep is surprisingly rich .",
    "for example , it exhibits boundary - induced phase transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking , and phase separation .",
    "furthermore , the asep is regarded as a primitive model for translation in protein synthesis @xcite , traffic flow @xcite , and formation of shocks @xcite ; it also appears in a kind of sequence alignment problem in computational biology @xcite .",
    "important mathematical techniques used to understand this model include the matrix ansatz of derrida , evans , hakim , and pasquier @xcite , and also the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "this paper concerns the asep on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath0 sites with open boundaries .",
    "particles may enter from the left at rate @xmath7 and from the right at rate @xmath8 ; they may exit the system to the right at rate @xmath9 and to the left at rate @xmath10 .",
    "the probability of hopping left and right is @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . , so we will often do so . ]",
    "dating back to at least 1982 , it was realized that there were connections between this model and combinatorics  for example , young diagrams appeared in @xcite , and catalan numbers arose in the analyses of the stationary distribution of the asep in @xcite . more recently , beginning with papers of brak and essam @xcite , and duchi and schaeffer @xcite , and followed by a number of works including @xcite , there has been a push to understand the roots of the combinatorial features of the asep .",
    "ideally , the goal is to find a combinatorial description of the stationary distribution : that is , to express each component of the stationary distribution as a generating function for a set of combinatorial objects .",
    "up to now , the best result in this direction was provided by @xcite , which addressed this question when @xmath6 in terms of permutation tableaux , combinatorial objects introduced in the context of total positivity on the grassmannian @xcite .",
    "there is a second reason why combinatorialists became intrigued by the asep .",
    "papers of sasamoto @xcite and subsequently uchiyama , sasamoto , and wadati @xcite linked the asep with open boundaries to orthogonal polynomials , in particular , to the askey - wilson polynomials .",
    "the askey - wilson polynomials are orthogonal polynomials that sit at the top of the hierarchy of ( basic ) hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials @xcite , in the sense that all other polynomials in this hierarchy are limiting cases or specializations of the askey - wilson polynomials .",
    "it is known that orthogonal polynomials have many combinatorial features : indeed , starting around the early 1980 s , mathematicians including flajolet @xcite , viennot @xcite , and foata @xcite , initiated a combinatorial approach to orthogonal polynomials . since then , combinatorial formulas have been given for the moments of ( the weight functions of ) many of the polynomials in the askey scheme , including @xmath5-hermite , chebyshev , @xmath5-laguerre , charlier , meixner , and al - salam - chihara polynomials , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , no such formula was known for the moments of the askey - wilson polynomials .",
    "therefore when the paper @xcite provided a close link between the moments of the askey - wilson polynomials and the stationary distribution of the asep , this gave the idea that a complete combinatorial understanding of the asep might also give rise to the combinatorics of the askey - wilson moments .    in this paper we give a complete solution to both of the above problems .",
    "namely , we introduce some new combinatorial objects , which we call _ staircase tableaux _ , and we prove that generating functions for staircase tableaux describe the stationary distribution of the asep , with all parameters general .",
    "we then use this result together with @xcite to give a combinatorial formula for the moments of the askey - wilson polynomials .",
    "the method of proof for our stationary distribution result builds upon important work of derrida , evans , hakim , and pasquier @xcite , who introduced a _ matrix ansatz _ as a tool for understanding its stationary distribution .",
    "briefly , the matrix ansatz says that if one can find matrices and vectors satisfying certain relations ( the _ dehp algebra _ ) , then each component of the stationary distribution of the asep can be expressed in terms of certain products of these matrices and vectors .",
    "knowing this ansatz , the strategy for proving our stationary distribution result which one would like to employ is the following : find matrices and vectors satisfying the dehp algebra , and show that appropriate products enumerate staircase tableaux .",
    "however , it has been known since 1996 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iv ) that when the parameters of the asep satisfy certain relations ( for example @xmath13 ) , there is no representation of the dehp algebra .",
    "therefore the above strategy can not succeed when all parameters of the asep are general .",
    "what we do instead is to introduce a slight generalization of the matrix ansatz ( see theorem [ ansatz2 ] ) , which is more flexible , albeit harder to use : instead of checking three identities , one must check three infinite families of identites . so",
    "our strategy is to find matrices and vectors such that appropriate products enumerate staircase tableaux , and prove that they satisfy the relations of the generalized matrix ansatz .",
    "this second step is quite involved , as our  matrices \" and  vectors \" are somewhat complicated ( they have four and two indices each , see section [ def - matrices ] ) , and there is no easy way to use induction to prove the three infinite families of identities .",
    "we believe that our new staircase tableaux deserve further study , because of their combinatorial interest and their potential connection to geometry .",
    "for example , staircase tableaux of size @xmath0 have cardinality @xmath14 , and hence are in bijection with doubly - signed permutations . in @xcite",
    ", we will prove this with an explicit bijection , and also develop connections to other combinatorial objects , including matchings , permutations , and trees .",
    "furthermore , because of the connection to the asep , we know that our staircase tableaux have some hidden symmetries which are not at all apparent from their definition .",
    "for instance , it is clear from the definition of the asep that the model remains unchanged if we reflect it over the @xmath15-axis , and exchange parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and @xmath5 and @xmath16 .",
    "however , the corresponding bijection on the level of tableaux has so far eluded us .",
    "finally , staircase tableaux generalize permutation tableaux , which index certain cells in the non - negative part of the grassmannian @xcite ; it would be interesting to better understand the relationship between the tableaux , the asep , and the geometry , and potentially generalize it to staircase tableaux .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in recent years there has been an explosion of activity @xcite surrounding another version of the asep , in which particles hop not on a finite lattice but on @xmath17 .",
    "much of this interest was inspired by johansson s work @xcite , which reinterprets the tasep ( totally asymmetric exclusion process ) as a randomly growing young diagram .",
    "johansson then used the well - understood combinatorics of young diagrams and semi - standard tableaux to approach the problem of current fluctuations in the tasep . in light of this",
    ", one may hope that a better understanding of the combinatorics of staircase tableaux could lead to even more results on the asep with open boundaries .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "we define the asep ( with open boundaries ) , and in sections [ results ] and [ aw section ] we state our main results on the asep and on askey - wilson polynomials . in section [ newansatz ] we prove a generalized matrix ansatz , and in sections [ proof1 ] and [ awproof ] we prove our results on the asep and askey - wilson polynomials .",
    "section [ conc ] gives open problems , and the appendix describes how staircase tableaux generalize permutation tableaux and alternative tableaux @xcite .",
    "acknowledgments : we would like to thank i. gessel , r. stanley , and j. de gier for interesting remarks .",
    "we are also grateful to the referees for their thoughtful comments , which helped us to greatly improve the exposition .",
    "the asep is often defined using a continuous time parameter @xcite .",
    "however , one can also define it as a discrete - time markov chain , as we will do below .",
    "the continuous and discrete - time definitions are equivalent in the sense that their stationary distributions are the same @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath16 be constants such that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the set of all @xmath25 words in the language @xmath26 .",
    "the asep is the markov chain on @xmath24 with transition probabilities :    * if @xmath27 and @xmath28 then @xmath29 ( particle hops right ) and @xmath30 ( particle hops left ) . * if @xmath31 and @xmath32 then @xmath33 ( particle enters from the left ) . * if @xmath34 and @xmath35 then @xmath36 ( particle exits to the right ) . * if @xmath37 and @xmath38 then @xmath39 ( particle exits to the left ) . *",

    "more specifically , the _ stationary distribution _ is the unique ( up to scaling ) eigenvector of the transition matrix of the markov chain with eigenvalue @xmath48 .",
    "the asep clearly has multiple symmetries , including the following .    *",
    "the  left - right \" symmetry : if we reflect the asep over the @xmath15-axis , we get back the same model , except that the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and @xmath16 and @xmath5 are switched . * the  arrow - reversal \" symmetry : if we exchange black and white particles , we get back the same model , except that the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath16 and @xmath5 are switched .",

    "these symmetries imply results about the stationary distribution .",
    "[ symmetries ] the steady state probabilities satisfy the following identities :    * @xmath55 , * @xmath56 , * @xmath57 .",
    "above , the notation @xmath58 indicates that the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 are exchanged .",
    "these symmetries are related to the symmetries of the askey - wilson polynomials ( see for example remark [ awsymmetry ] ) , though neither is a direct consequence of the other .",
    "the main combinatorial objects of this paper are some new tableaux which we call _ staircase tableaux_. these tableaux generalize permutation tableaux ( equivalently , alternative tableaux ) .    a _ staircase tableau _ of size @xmath0 is a young diagram of  staircase \" shape @xmath59 such that boxes are either empty or labeled with @xmath60 , or @xmath4 , subject to the following conditions :    * no box along the diagonal is empty ; * all boxes in the same row and to the left of a @xmath3 or a @xmath4 are empty ; * all boxes in the same column and above an @xmath1 or a @xmath2 are empty .",

    "[ weight ] the _ weight _ @xmath62 of a staircase tableau @xmath63 is a monomial in @xmath64 , and @xmath16 , which we obtain as follows . every blank box of @xmath63 is assigned a @xmath5 or @xmath16 , based on the label of the closest labeled box to its right in the same row and the label of the closest labeled box below it in the same column , such that :    * every blank box which sees a @xmath3 to its right gets assigned a @xmath16 ; * every blank box which sees a @xmath4 to its right gets assigned a @xmath5 ; * every blank box which sees an @xmath1 or @xmath2 to its right , and an @xmath1 or @xmath4 below it , gets assigned a @xmath16 ; * every blank box which sees an @xmath1 or @xmath2 to its right , and a @xmath3 or @xmath2 below it , gets assigned a @xmath5 .    after assigning a @xmath5 or @xmath16 to each blank box in this way",

    "in @xcite and @xcite , which concerned the asep with parameters @xmath6 , we gave combinatorial expressions for the stationary distribution in terms of _ permutation tableaux _ : more specifically , the steady state probability of a state @xmath68 was given by enumerating permutation tableaux lying in a young diagram of shape @xmath82 , according to the number of @xmath48 s in the top row and the number of unrestricted rows .",

    "<S> introduced in the late 1960 s @xcite , the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) is an important model from statistical mechanics which describes a system of interacting particles hopping left and right on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath0 sites . it has been cited as a model for traffic flow and protein synthesis . in the most general form of the asep with open boundaries , particles may enter and exit at the left with probabilities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and they may exit and enter at the right with probabilities @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the bulk , </S>",
    "<S> the probability of hopping left is @xmath5 times the probability of hopping right . </S>",
    "<S> the first main result of this paper is a combinatorial formula for the stationary distribution of the asep with all parameters general , in terms of a new class of tableaux which we call _ staircase tableaux_. this generalizes our previous work @xcite for the asep with parameters @xmath6 . using our first result and also results of uchiyama - sasamoto - wadati @xcite , we derive our second main result : a combinatorial formula for the moments of askey - wilson polynomials . since the early 1980 s there has been a great deal of work giving combinatorial formulas for moments of various other classical orthogonal polynomials ( e.g. hermite , charlier , laguerre , meixner ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is the first such formula for the askey - wilson polynomials , which are at the top of the hierarchy of classical orthogonal polynomials . </S>"
