    "long - accepted conventional wisdom  @xcite precludes the large @xmath0 limit of qcd  @xcite from supporting narrow tetraquark states ( _ i.e. _ , whose widths are suppressed by powers of @xmath3 ) .",
    "the original argument was formulated by witten  @xcite and described in coleman s classic lectures on large @xmath0 physics  @xcite . recently",
    "weinberg  @xcite has questioned this lore by pointing out a serious loophole in the reasoning .    the argument espoused by witten  @xcite and coleman  @xcite states that a tetraquark source of the form @xmath4 can always be expressed ( owing to fierz reordering ) as a sum of products of two color - singlet @xmath5 operators , each of which sources single - meson states at leading order in @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the two - point function of @xmath6 , which is @xmath7 due to the two closed , disconnected color loops that follow the quark and antiquark lines , is dominated by the creation and annihilation of two - meson states .",
    "since each meson terminus supplies a decay constant @xmath8 , the scaling of the full two - point function is saturated by the @xmath9 free propagation of two noninteracting mesons and no tetraquark states .    however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this argument only applies to the leading - order ( @xmath10 ) disconnected diagram ; the leading _ connected _ diagram has only a single quark color loop [ @xmath11 and therefore excludes the leading order of free two - meson propagation .",
    "for the connected contribution of the @xmath6 two - point function , the propagation of single free tetraquark states with decay constants @xmath12 can contribute at leading order .",
    "moreover , analysis  @xcite of the connected three - point function of a @xmath6 source and two bilinear @xmath5 sources @xmath13 , which is also @xmath14 , gives a tetraquark - meson - meson coupling of @xmath15 , producing a tetraquark decay width of @xmath16 : if tetraquarks exist as @xmath17 , they are narrow . for certain special flavor quantum numbers , the tetraquark states must be even narrower  @xcite .    that new states should first appear in the @xmath0-subleading part of a correlation function is not a novel idea ; in fact , precisely the same argument as above may applied to the @xmath18 four - point correlation function , whose leading - order ( @xmath10 ) disconnected piece is again saturated by noninteracting two - meson states , but whose leading connected [ @xmath11 piece contains scattering through single - meson states with @xmath15 trilinear and @xmath19 quartic couplings .",
    "this mechanism allows , for example , the well - known resonant scattering @xmath20 to occur at large @xmath0 .",
    "the possibility considered by weinberg is that tetraquarks behave similarly : if a tetraquark exists and couples to two ordinary mesons with @xmath15 strength , then one finds no contradiction with standard @xmath0 counting rules for meson - meson scattering , nor with a leading - order ( @xmath10 ) disconnected contribution .",
    "however , obtaining @xmath21 may require a subtle limiting mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we note that certain other exotic hadrons , ( those with neither exclusively @xmath5 meson nor @xmath22 baryon quantum numbers ) do occur in the conventional large @xmath0 limit .",
    "glueballs have @xmath0-suppressed couplings to mesons  @xcite , leading both to a parametric suppression of glueball - meson mixing amplitudes [ @xmath15 ] and glueball decay widths to two - meson states [ @xmath24 . meanwhile , hybrid mesons ( those requiring at least a single `` valence gluon '' in addition to @xmath5 in order to obtain the quantum numbers of the state , such as @xmath25 ) behave just like ordinary mesons at large @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the fact that hadrons with exotic quark structure often have the same quantum numbers as nonexotic hadrons ( so - called `` cryptoexotic '' states ) and therefore can mix with them is a major contributing factor to the lack of clear evidence for exotics .",
    "the phenomenon of cryptoexotic - conventional meson mixing is just as apparent for large-@xmath0 tetraquarks with nonexotic quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "note that , even though cleanly identifying the role of cryptoexotics in the spectrum has intrinsic difficulties , the literature has a long tradition of explaining various scalar resonances that do not fit into simple quark models as being cryptoexotics  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on tetraquark with exotic quantum numbers , and in particular those with quantum numbers requiring at least two quarks and two antiquarks in all fock components .",
    "examples include isospin-2 states , doubly - strange states , and strange states with isospin @xmath26 .",
    "we do this to keep the issue as theoretically crisp as possible .",
    "the question of whether a component of a quantum state is or is not cryptoexotic has theoretical ambiguities , and could depend upon the precise definition of precisely what constitutes a cryptoexotic state ; such a definition may depend upon a choice of basis or of lorentz frame .",
    "in contrast , quantum - number exotic configurations are unambiguously exotic .",
    "it is significant that the logic of ref .",
    "@xcite does not rule out , but also does not guarantee , the existence of tetraquarks . in particular , the analysis shows that previous arguments ruling out tetraquarks at large @xmath0 are wrong , but _ not _ that tetraquarks must , in fact , exist . the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite uses the best - known @xmath3 expansion , in which each quark carries a single color index in the fundamental ( f ) representation of su(@xmath0 ) , a theory we label qcd(f ) .",
    "however , it is worth recalling that the extrapolation from @xmath27 to large @xmath0 is not unique . for the physical case of @xmath28 , the color two - index antisymmetric ( as ) representation of su(@xmath0 ) is isomorphic to the ( anti-)fundamental via the identification @xmath29 . for larger @xmath0 ,",
    "the two representations differ  @xcite and therefore give rise to distinct large @xmath0 limits and distinct @xmath3 expansions for the two theories . the new expansion based on quarks in the two - index antisymmetric representation",
    "is denoted as qcd(as ) . while the study of qcd(as ) at large @xmath0 was largely motivated by the appearance of elegant field theoretic dualities  @xcite , one",
    "may instead develop the formalism for physical baryons  @xcite and investigate whether qcd(f ) or qcd(as ) is phenomenologically superior for a given set of observables  @xcite .",
    "in the case of mesons , it was shown very recently  @xcite that the presence two distinct color indices on each qcd(as ) quark field allows one to define a single - color - trace source @xmath6 with tetraquark quantum numbers .",
    "the implication of this finding is that tetraquarks contribute to the @xmath6 two - point correlator in leading order in the @xmath3 expansion but two - meson states can not .",
    "therefore , tetraquarks necessarily appear in the spectrum of qcd(as ) as narrow hadrons .",
    "the demonstration that tetraquarks exist in qcd(as ) raises the question of whether it is possible to go beyond weinberg s argument  @xcite and prove the existence of tetraquarks in qcd(f ) .",
    "we have not been able to do so .",
    "moreover , we suspect that the reason is likely to be that that narrow tetraquark resonances do not exist in the large @xmath0 limit of qcd(f ) .",
    "this suspicion is based on the demonstration reported here that the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which tetraquarks associated with the leading - order connected diagrams exist and have widths of @xmath19 ( the most natural scenario if narrow tetraquarks exist ) , can not be correct for quantum - number exotic channels provided the standard assumptions used in large @xmath0 analysis hold .",
    "this demonstration is based on a careful analysis of the analytic structure of the meson - meson scattering amplitude at leading nontrivial order in the @xmath3 expansion .",
    "ultimately , the result follows because all connected diagrams associated with four - point functions for quark bilinear sources at leading order in @xmath0 possess no @xmath30-channel cuts associated with a tetraquark .",
    "the result shown here implies that one of three possibilities must be true : i ) quantum - number exotic tetraquarks do not exist at large @xmath0 for qcd(f ) ; ii ) tetraquarks exist , but are associated with subleading connected diagrams and have anomalously small widths that scale as @xmath2 or smaller ; or iii ) the conventional assumptions used in large @xmath0 analysis are inadequate .",
    "-channel tetraquark contribution to meson - meson scattering.,width=192 ]    the analysis is based on an indirect proof .",
    "we begin by supposing that the scenario proposed by weinberg  @xcite is correct : a narrow quantum - number exotic tetraquark resonance exists at large @xmath0 with a coupling to mesons of @xmath15 .",
    "ultimately , we will show that this assumption leads to a contradiction .",
    "the process at the hadronic level is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schannel ] .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is useful to remind the reader that the scattering amplitude upon which we focus and the four - point correlation function of four - quark bilinear sources are related by the standard lehmann - symanzik - zimmermann ( lsz ) reduction formula .",
    "that is , the scattering amplitude is given by the appropriately normalized _ amputated _ four - point function .",
    "for the case in which the incident and final mesons are ( pseudo)scalars , the four - point correlation function in momentum space depends upon six kinematic variables : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , as well as @xmath30 and @xmath35 .",
    "the scattering amplitude , in contrast , fixes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 to assume their on - shell values for the particular mesons of interest , and is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the four - point correlation function in momentum space for quark bilinear sources @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the diagonal two - point correlation function for linear source @xmath40 .",
    "note that this structure guarantees the external mesons are always on shell in the scattering amplitude .",
    "however , the amplitude @xmath41 itself is taken to be a general function of ( complex ) @xmath30 and @xmath35 , which can correspond to unphysical values that can not be reached by the on - shell mesons .",
    "analogous expressions hold for the case in which the external mesons carry spin ( recall that the large-@xmath0 world supports stable higher spin - mesons ) .",
    "it is also useful to note that the scattering amplitude can be written in the form of a fixed-@xmath35 dispersion relation : @xmath42 where we have assumed two subtractions .",
    "we make the standard assumption that this form continues to hold in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the key to our analysis is that , if the weinberg scenario is correct , it follows from this standard dispersion analysis that the scattering amplitude for meson - meson scattering amplitudes has @xmath30-channel spectral strength concentrated at the position of the tetraquarks over a region of width @xmath1 and with integrated strength of @xmath16 .",
    "we focus on the @xmath30 channel since the quantum numbers are given by the incident mesons , and the physical production of tetraquarks in scattering occurs only in this channel due to kinematic constraints . if one can demonstrate that the spectral function @xmath43 for meson - meson scattering does not support @xmath30-channel spectra of this character , then the weinberg scenario is ruled out .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : diagrams ] focuses on feynman diagrams at the quark - gluon level that contribute to the leading - order connected four - point correlation function for quark bilinear sources .",
    "a critical issue is the connection between a spacetime representation of the diagrams and a description in terms of color flow .",
    "in fact , the feynman diagrams are actually identical and are merely drawn in different ways .",
    "section  [ sec : cuts ] identifies all possible types of cuts of these leading - order connected diagrams and the intermediate states revealed by them .",
    "these cuts play a critical role in that they are associated with the spectral function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) .",
    "a careful analysis of these cuts shows that no possible cut corresponds to a tetraquark intermediate state in meson - meson scattering .",
    "we summarize and discuss our conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] ; here , the issue of cryptoexotics is addressed briefly .",
    "the analysis depends upon a number of standard assumptions used in large @xmath0 , which are also discussed briefly in the concluding section .",
    "this section focuses on the four - point function of @xmath5 bilinear sources labeled @xmath44 . following weinberg  @xcite",
    ", we consider only the leading - order connected diagrams . as a first step , we consider the diagrams rendered in spacetime so that the initial meson sources are placed at the bottom of the diagram and the final meson sources ( actually sinks ) are placed at the top ( _ i.e. _ , time flows upward ) . in this analysis , we focus on the @xmath0 counting and assume the standard counting rules : we count only @xmath0 factors arising from color traces ( each closed color loop contributing @xmath45 ) and factors of @xmath46 from gluon vertices .",
    "typical leading - order connected diagrams are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_legs ] .",
    "it is straightforward to show , using t  hooft double - line color - flow diagrams , that all of these diagrams are @xmath14 and hence of leading order .",
    "this result might come as something of a surprise since diagrams b ) and c ) do not appear to be planar , and it is well known that all leading - order connected diagrams containing quark lines are planar and bounded by the quark loop . however , the sense in which planarity holds has to do with color flow and not with spacetime .",
    "that is , a diagram is of leading order in @xmath0 counting if , ignoring spacetime considerations , the diagram _ can _ be drawn in a plane with the quark line bounding the diagram .",
    "planarity is entirely determined by how the quarks and gluons in the diagram are connected topologically and not on how momentum flows from source to sink .",
    "this distinction is critically important since the question of @xmath30-channel spectral strength clearly depends upon the spacetime flow of momentum in the diagram .",
    "the leading - order connected diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_legs ] can be easily seen to be planar and bounded by a quark loop if one ignores the momentum flow and unfolds them , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] .",
    "in fact , the diagrams in fig .  [",
    "fig : typical_legs ] are identical to the corresponding ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] , in which it is apparent that any leading - order connected diagram associated with a four - point function can be represented by a square with the four quark bilinear sources ( sinks ) on the vertices .",
    "one can then return to momentum - flow form by considering how the sources inject momentum into the system .",
    "again , the issue is topological : how the various momenta inserted into the system are related .",
    "one can divide such diagrams into topological classes .",
    "superficially there appear to be 24 classes of leading - order connected diagram since each of the four bilinears can attach to any of the four vertices .",
    "however , since the value of the diagram does not change if the square is rotated through any multiple of @xmath47 radians , the number of independent classes reduces to six .",
    "one can label the class of diagram by the order of the vertices , with @xmath48 and @xmath13 representing the sources of the two incoming mesons and @xmath49 and @xmath50 the outgoing ones , ordered counterclockwise starting at the bottom left , so that diagram a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] is labeled @xmath51 .",
    "cyclic combinations of the square are identified because they correspond to the same diagram : @xmath51 is equivalent to @xmath52 . finally , because of crossing symmetry , if one reverses the order of the sources and flips all internal gluons along the diagonal , the value of the diagram changes by at most a phase .",
    "thus one can reverse the ordering so that , _ e.g. _ , @xmath51 is in the same class as @xmath53 , leaving three classes .",
    "figures  [ fig : typical_legs ] and [ fig : typical_cut ] give one representative of each class .",
    "it is worth noting that not all of these classes of leading - order connected diagrams contribute to processes in the quantum - number exotic channels of interest here .",
    "consider for concreteness the case of processes that carry @xmath54 in the @xmath30 channel .",
    "it is easy to show that classes @xmath51 and @xmath55 [ corresponding to diagrams a ) and c ) in fig .  [ fig : typical_cut ] ] do not contribute to @xmath54 processes in the @xmath30 channel , while class @xmath56 [ corresponding to diagram b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] ] does . to see why , note that the @xmath30 channel carries the quantum numbers injected at sources @xmath48 and @xmath13 .",
    "since the process carries @xmath54 in the @xmath30 channel , the sources @xmath48 and @xmath13 together must provide @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , since the gluons are isosinglets , isospin can be injected into the diagram only at sources @xmath48 , @xmath13 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . in diagrams of classes @xmath51 and @xmath55 , vertices @xmath48 and @xmath13 are adjacent . the quark line connecting the adjacent @xmath48 and @xmath13 vertices , treated as a @xmath5 pair , can be considered an isosinglet source ( since deep in the diagram , it turns into pure glue ) ; the two remaining quarks in the @xmath30-channel can carry no more than @xmath57 and therefore give a vanishing matrix element with an @xmath54 operator .",
    "this section describes the role in the analysis of `` cuts '' , for which two related meanings are relevant .",
    "the first meaning is related to the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude [ @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) ] , or more generally , @xmath59-point correlation functions @xmath60 .",
    "consider for example eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) , which relates the real and imaginary parts of @xmath58 . as an analytic function of @xmath30",
    ", @xmath58 has a cut over the full region in which the spectral function @xmath43 is a nonzero and continuous function .",
    "note that the cut is associated with accessible physical states : it corresponds to all values of @xmath30 for which the system can go on shell .    at the level of perturbation",
    "theory for the underlying theory of quarks and gluons , `` cut '' can also be used to describe the process of dividing a diagram into two distinct regions .",
    "typically , this separation can be done in more than one way .",
    "the region along the boundary between the regions can be referred to as the `` cut '' .",
    "the combination of quarks and gluons along the cut corresponds to a particular quark - gluon intermediate state contributing in perturbation theory .",
    "these two meanings are strongly related : when the hadronic intermediate states revealed by cutting a diagram go on shell , they contribute to the cut in the sense of the analytic function ( to the extent that such states are calculable in perturbation theory ) .    one class of cuts is easily depicted by using the color - flow diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] : a diagram in each of the three classes can be cut in two natural ways . in the class @xmath51 of a )",
    ", one can generate an @xmath30-channel cut ( cutting through both quark lines separating the @xmath48 and @xmath13 vertices from the @xmath49 and @xmath50 vertices ) or a @xmath35-channel cut ( separating vertices @xmath48 , @xmath49 from @xmath13 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "of course , more than one particular cut is available , depending upon which specific gluon lines are cut , but these two basic cut structures naturally arise .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] shows @xmath61- and @xmath35-channel cuts for class @xmath56 and @xmath30- and @xmath61-channel cuts for class @xmath55 .    the types of cuts shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] clearly do not contain intermediate quark - gluon states that contribute to tetraquark states .",
    "all of these cuts contain precisely one @xmath62 pair in the intermediate states ; thus , they contribute to mesons , not tetraquarks . recall that we seek only @xmath30-channel singularities connected with the physical intermediate states created in the scattering process .",
    "it is significant that fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] has @xmath30-channel cuts only in classes @xmath51 and @xmath55 but not @xmath56 , but this result is not surprising : as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : diagrams ] , @xmath30-channel quantum - number exotic channels correspond only to class @xmath56 among the leading - order connected diagrams .",
    "if class @xmath56 had meson - type @xmath30-channel contributions , one would have a contradiction : the exotic channels associated with this class by definition lack ordinary meson contributions .",
    "however , as it turns out , the kinds of cuts shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] that seem natural when the diagrams are drawn in planar form are not the only ones appearing in the four - point functions at leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "the key point is that the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] are drawn in a form to emphasize color - flow connectivity and not the flow in spacetime . however , the spacetime description is the most relevant one for understanding the cuts . to make this point clear ,",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : topprop ] .",
    "the diagram is of class @xmath56 and hence can arise in an exotic @xmath30-channel scattering process .",
    "this class is also analogous to diagrams considered by weinberg in ref .",
    "the critical point is that the diagram viewed in its spacetime form clearly has an @xmath30-channel cut passing through two quarks and two antiquarks .",
    "that is , it has the correct quantum - number content to be a tetraquark .",
    "in fact , if one considers quantum - number exotic channels and restricts attention to leading - order connected diagrams , all @xmath30-channel cuts clearly have this character : the intermediate states revealed by the cut always contain two quarks and two antiquarks .",
    "the critical question is whether these cuts reveal resonant tetraquark states or merely two noninteracting ( or weakly interacting ) mesons .",
    "it is possible to definitively answer this question if one accepts the standard assumptions used in large @xmath0 analysis . to see how , note that if one unfolds the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : topprop ] given in spacetime form ( the first inset ) to write it in manifestly planar color - flow form ( the second inset ) , the line denoting the cut breaks into two distinct parts . in the case indicated here , one part cuts off vertex @xmath48 and the other cuts off vertex @xmath13 ; that is , it literally cuts the corners off the diagram ( in the literal transcription of this cut , the cut termini at the top and bottom of the color - flow diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : topprop ] are identified ) .",
    "it is guaranteed that _ any _ @xmath30-channel cut for all diagrams in class @xmath56 ( and hence for all leading - order connected diagrams in quantum - number exotic channels ) cut corners in the diagram written in planar form , either the corners @xmath48 and @xmath13 as the preceding example , or the corners @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the reason is simple topology : in class @xmath56 , corners @xmath48 and @xmath13 are opposite from each other , as are corners @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "however , an @xmath30-channel cut by definition cuts the region associated with the incoming particles ( which contains vertices @xmath48 , @xmath13 ) from the region associated with the outgoing particles ( which contains vertices @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) . in a spacetime description , a single line across the diagram always accomplishes the cut . however ,",
    "since @xmath48 and @xmath13 lie diagonally across from each other in planar form ( as do @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , no single line across the diagram can represent the cut .",
    "the only resolution is to make such a cut remove two diagonally separated corners and associate the disconnected regions of the two corners to be part of the same `` side '' of the cut .",
    "the physical significance of the fact that the @xmath30-channel cuts always isolate opposite corners for leading - order connected diagrams in exotic channels ( and for class @xmath56 generally ) is clear : the individual cuts across the two corners carry precisely the four - momentum and color structure ( singlet ) injected at each of the two sources .",
    "the four - momentum entering at sources @xmath48 and @xmath13 is conserved at every vertex and must flow out of the corner , but the only way out of the corner is across the cut .",
    "this result is crucial because the object of interest is the scattering amplitude @xmath58_i.e .",
    "_ , the appropriately normalized _ amputated _ four - point correlation function  rather than the four - point correlation function @xmath37 itself ;",
    "as noted in the introduction , the scattering amplitude _ must _ contain a tetraquark if the mesons couple to tetraquarks .",
    "moreover , if one accepts the standard assumptions underlying the large @xmath0 analysis of hadrons and weinberg s scenario that tetraquarks couple to two meson with a strength of @xmath63 , then it must be true that the scattering amplitude computed using the leading - order connected diagrams contains analytic singularities in the @xmath30 channel associated with the tetraquark intermediate state .",
    "however , the lsz reduction rule removes all spectral strength from the incoming and outgoing mesons to produce the scattering amplitude . in @xmath58 , the only contributions to the spectral strength @xmath43 come from intermediate states that are distinct from the incident and outgoing ones ; the factors of @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) ensure this .",
    "in particular , when one cuts the corner of a diagram , the contribution associated with the cut corner to the scattering gives no spectral strength and thus no cut ( in the sense of analytic functions ) ; it has been removed from the full four - point function via lsz reduction .",
    "physically , the spectral strength in the four - point function associated with cut corners corresponds to the external meson states only and not to any intermediate state .",
    "the preceding argument implies that an exotic diagram such as fig .",
    "[ fig : topprop ] produces no spectral strength at leading @xmath0 order in the @xmath30 channel , and hence no leading - order contribution to the scattering amplitude . in terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) , @xmath43 vanishes at @xmath16 .",
    "however , in the scenario in which tetraquarks exist and couple to two mesons with a strength @xmath65 , tetraquarks must be present in the scattering amplitude if the standard assumptions for large @xmath0 hadrons hold .",
    "thus we are forced to conclude that , for the case of exotic channels , either the scenario in which quantum - number exotic tetraquarks exist and couple with a strength @xmath63 is incorrect , or the standard large @xmath0 assumptions are inadequate .",
    "we should note that the vanishing of the leading - order spectral strength in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) for exotic channels does _ not _ imply the absence of scattering at this order .",
    "rather , it means that leading - order scattering comes through @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which can arise through @xmath35-channel exchange .",
    "the argument we have presented implies that either the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which quantum - number exotic tetraquarks exist and couple with a strength @xmath63 , is incorrect , or the standard assumptions about hadrons in large @xmath0 are inadequate .",
    "let us first consider the possibility that some of the standard assumptions used in large @xmath0 hadronic analysis might be incorrect .",
    "one should note that a variety of such assumptions occur  some explicitly made in the large @xmath0 literature and others that are implicit .",
    "we believe that these assumptions are highly plausible and we have no reason to doubt any of them .    as a question of logic ,",
    "however , it remains possible that one or more of these assumptions is not valid and that as a result , quantum - number exotic tetraquarks are not excluded from arising through leading - order connected diagrams .",
    "let us consider an example : it is always implicitly assumed that the standard dispersion relations and spectral representations of field theory hold in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "now of course , they are supposed to hold for any legitimate field theory , any hence should hold for qcd at any @xmath0 .",
    "however , this assertion does not necessarily imply that these relations are valid for the large @xmath0 limit of the theory .",
    "such issues could arise , for example , due to some types of nonanalytic behavior in @xmath3 for correlation functions as @xmath68 . as a concrete model in which such behavior could allow quantum - number exotic tetraquarks ,",
    "consider the example in ref .",
    "there , it is assumed that the four - point function in position space has a coupling to the tetraquark scaling as @xmath69 $ ] , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the positions of the two quark bilinears .",
    "such nonanalytic behavior has the consequence that widely separated quark bilinear sources  the type associated with external mesons  do not couple to tetraquarks , while overlapping sources do .",
    "thus , even though tetraquarks by construction exist in the theory and couple to mesons , at large @xmath0 they have no spectral strength in the scattering amplitude , in contradiction to what one expects from a spectral representation .",
    "the example above is hardly unique .",
    "many assumptions used in large @xmath0 analysis are believed to be true but have never been rigorously proven and , if false , would invalidate the argument of the preceding section .",
    "for example , a basic tenet of the analysis to assume the leading @xmath3 scaling of a correlation function is the same as the that of the leading class of contributing feynman diagrams .",
    "this assertion is highly plausible and is the basis for almost all analyses of hadrons at large @xmath0 .",
    "it is nevertheless not guaranteed to be true in a mathematical sense , since the perturbative expansion embodied in the feynman diagrams is not convergent . if it is false , one can easily evade the argument given above : only the _ leading_-order diagrams lack spectral strength in the @xmath30 channel for the scattering amplitude in exotic channels , and the tetraquark could be built up from formally subleading perturbative orders .",
    "overall , we view such possibilities ( while being logically not excluded ) as being highly unlikely .",
    "the standard large @xmath0 analysis has produced many useful insights into hadronic physics , and it seems unlikely that exceptions should first become apparent in the tetraquark sector . if one accepts the standard large @xmath0 assumptions , then the analysis here rules out the possibility that quantum - number exotic channels follow the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which tetraquarks exist and arise due to the leading - order connected diagrams , and accordingly couple to two mesons with a strength of @xmath15 . then two possibilities remain : either narrow tetraquarks do not exist , or they arise from subleading diagrams and couple to mesons at @xmath16 or less ( making them even narrower ) .    consideration of the second possibility actually follows the basic insight ref .",
    "@xcite , where weinberg observed that just because the leading [ @xmath7 ] contribution to the two - point correlation function of a source with tetraquark quantum numbers is a pure two - meson state with no resonant tetraquark contribution does not mean that no tetraquark contribution arises in the first subleading contribution , which happens to be the leading contribution for the connected correlator .",
    "here we have shown ( modulo the assumptions discussed above ) that , in exotic channels the leading connected diagrams also contain no tetraquark contributions .",
    "however , a simple extension of weinberg s logic leads one to the observation that subleading contributions could contain a tetraquark .",
    "how plausible is this ?",
    "we believe it unlikely to be correct . to see why , consider the analogous situation of mesons at large @xmath0 , in which mesons arise from the leading - order [ @xmath11 correlation functions of quark bilinears .",
    "one deduces that mesons , for reasons of self - consistency , have widths that scale as @xmath3 . using the standard analysis",
    ", can one falsify the existence of an additional class of special mesons with the same quantum numbers as the ordinary ones but that arise from subleading diagrams and have anomalously small [ @xmath24 widths ? at a strict formal level , the answer is `` no '' .",
    "however , the idea seems quite far - fetched .",
    "indeed , occam s razor argues against it : we know of no reason why such a peculiar behavior ought to emerge , and in the absence of a compelling reason , it appears to be unlikely . in much the same way",
    ", it seems quite far - fetched that ultra - narrow tetraquarks should arise from subleading diagrams . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds channels with special flavor content that would require tetraquarks ( were they to exist ) to have particularly narrow [ @xmath73 widths .",
    "however , the case considered here is whether `` ordinary '' tetraquarks with , _ e.g. _ , @xmath54 are anomalously narrow .",
    "thus , we conclude that quantum - number exotic narrow tetraquarks are unlikely to exist as resonant states at large @xmath0 in qcd(f ) .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively very different from that of qcd(as ) , in which such states are known to exist  @xcite .",
    "such a difference is both awkward and interesting , since one hopes to use large @xmath0 behavior as a guide for our @xmath27 world .",
    "since the two distinct large @xmath0 limits are qualitatively different for tetraquarks , the presence or absence of observably narrow tetraquarks at @xmath27 provides an exciting opportunity to distinguish which limit is superior in this case .    finally , the analysis here is limited to quantum - number exotic channels .",
    "what would change for nonexotic channels ? as noted above , the situation becomes more ambiguous , because it is difficult to separate cryptoexotic components from those of conventional mesons .",
    "one thing is clear : our analysis shows that the diagrams in class @xmath56 can not contribute to the spectral strength in the scattering amplitude for tetraquark channels . on the other hand , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical_cut ] , classes @xmath51 and @xmath55 do have @xmath30-channel spectral strength , but these are of a @xmath5 nature and can be ascribed to mesons rather than tetraquarks .",
    "thus it appears likely that any sensible definition of `` tetraquark '' in cryptoexotic channels yields is no specifically tetraquark spectral strength .",
    "since the large @xmath0 limit of qcd(f ) has produced so many useful phenomenological insights , the exciting possibility of narrow tetraquarks gives hope for the eventual observation of such a state .",
    "however , we have found that no mechanism relying upon the conventional counting of @xmath0 factors , even ones with unusual diagrammatic and cut structures , give rise to parametrically narrow tetraquarks .",
    "even so , the alternative and phenomenologically viable qcd(as ) large @xmath0 limit remains a possibility for producing naturally narrow tetraquarks .",
    "lastly , other suppressions having nothing to do with @xmath0 counting ( _ e.g. _ , by heavy quark masses , as may be the case for the @xmath74  @xcite ) might still make an observably narrow tetraquark state viable .      99 e.  witten , nucl .  phys .",
