    "[ tab - occu ]    in order to test the impact of na chiral distribution on the spin ordering , dft calculations of exchange couplings @xmath23-@xmath24-@xmath25 for systems having three different site occupancy assignments are compared , from calculation using the refined occupancies of 62.5@xmath55na1/37.5@xmath55na2 to the fully occupied na2 and na1 , as shown in table  [ tab - occu ] .",
    "it is found that the dominant @xmath24 is not affected significantly by the occupancy change , but the weak @xmath23 and @xmath25 couplings are reduced accordingly .",
    "based on these simulated calculations , we propose that the observed na - layer 2d chiral distribution via weighted multiplet splitting can not affect the magnetic couplings significantly .",
    "while the in - plane antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains [ see fig .  [ fig - spinstru](a ) ] may break the mirror symmetry of the honeycomb network via an expected peierls - like afm inter - chain coupling , current neutron and x - ray structure analysis failed to detect the expected mirror symmetry breaking , instead , an in - plane chirality was uniquely identified in the na - layer .",
    "it is likely that the 2d chiral distribution pattern identified in the na - layer may induce the structure relaxation via phonon softening only without breaking the original 3d crystal symmetry .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the ift - assisted powder neutron diffraction refinement technique is crucial to provide an accurate site refinement for the diffusive na ions in the layered material like na@xmath1ni@xmath1teo@xmath2 . a chiral distribution pattern hidden in the na - layer is found to be intimately related to its diffusion behavior and the spin structure of ni arranged in a honeycomb network .",
