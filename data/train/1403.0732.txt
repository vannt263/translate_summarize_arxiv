    "there are spatially extended ly@xmath0 profiles of laes in figure [ fig : lpsf ] , but here we investigate whether these spatially extended ly@xmath0 profiles are real or spurious signals . because the central profiles of large - scale psfs are contaminated by saturation , we connect the large - scale psf to the small - scale psf ( section [ image_stacking ] ) in the radius range with no saturation effects .",
    "figure [ fig : lpsf ] indicates that the large - scale psfs provide fluxes much fainter than the ly@xmath0 emission by @xmath107 magnitudes , and that the profile shape of large - scale psf are clearly different from those of extended ly@xmath0 .",
    "we thus confirm that the large - scale psfs do not mimic the extended ly@xmath0 profile of our laes .              in section [ large - scale_psf_errors ]",

    "although the large - scale flat - fielding error may not be a major source of systematics in our high - quality images of suprime - cam , one needs to carefully evaluate total errors contributed from all sources of systematics .",
    "we carry out image stacking for objects that are not laes , which are referred to as non - laes .",
    "because non - laes have no intrinsically extended emission - line halos like lahs , extended profiles of non - lae composite images should be given by a total of all systematic effects .",

    "first , we randomly choose non - laes with the same number as our laes .",
    "these non - laes have size and nb - magnitude distributions same as those of our lae samples ( figure [ fig : sample_nonlae ] ) . to make a ly@xmath0 image of the non - lae sample , we normalize a composite continuum image to match the total flux of a composite nb image , and then subtract the continuum image from the composite nb image .",

    "we identify no significant extended profiles in these images .",
    "we should note that a ring - like structure found at the source centers of @xmath66 data is attributable to the slight differences of small - scale psf profiles of continuum and nb images , which are irrelevant to the extended profiles .",

    "besides the large - scale psf , there are a number of potential systematic effects , such as flat - fielding and sky subtraction errors ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as unknown systematics . to reveal the total systematic errors involved in our data and analysis , we stack non - laes ( figure [ fig : sample_nonlae ] ) in the same manner as our laes , and carry out the empirical tests . we find that there exist systematic errors that make an extended emission signal , but that no systematic errors can make a radial profile with the sb amplitude and shape similar to those of our extended ly@xmath0 emission of laes , except for our sample of @xmath106 laes whose data quality is poor ( figure [ fig : radi_nonlae ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that we definitively identify lahs around the laes with our data by our analysis technique .",
    "our results indicate that laes commonly possess lahs at @xmath7 .      in theoretical studies ,",
    "lahs are thought to be produced primarily by two physical mechanisms : 1 ) the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 in the cgm and/or igm ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and 2 ) the cold streams ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our observational results imply that lahs would be made by the former mechanism .",
    "first , we discuss the possibility of resonant scattering .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons escaping from a galaxy are scattered by the neutral hydrogen in the cgm within a few 100 kpc from the center of galaxy , making the ly@xmath0 emission extended more than that of stellar continuum .",
    "theoretical predictions indicate that the sb profiles of lahs are determined by a combination of the ism dynamics and distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have carried out monte carlo radiative transfer simulations of ly@xmath0 propagating through the ism with various kinematic properties , and found that the extent of lahs is @xmath149 kpc . @xcite",
    "have predicted that the clumpy and inhomogeneous ism produces an lah with a characteristic radius of @xmath150 kpc in their cosmological simulations .",
    "the lahs from our observations also extend up to a radius of @xmath151 kpc similar to those of the simulations ( figure [ fig : radi_allz ] ) .",
    "moreover , similar lahs are predicted for the neutral igm scattering ly@xmath0 photons at the epoch of reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the sizes of observed lahs are comparable to those of ly@xmath0 scattering models , which indicate that the major physical origin of the lah is probably the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons in neutral hydrogen of the cgm and/or igm .",
    "second , we examine whether the cold streams would be a major mechanism of the lah formation .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have predicted that high - redshift ( @xmath152 ) galaxies assemble baryon via accretion of relatively dense and cold gas ( @xmath153 k ) that represents the cold streams ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at the temperature of @xmath153",
    "k , the cold gas could primarily emit ly@xmath0 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which would produce an lah around galaxies @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations have predicted that ly@xmath0 emission are more extended for a higher dark halo mass of host galaxies . @xcite",
    "have found that cold streams in dark halos with a mass of @xmath154 m@xmath155 produce extended ly@xmath0 structures , but that ly@xmath0 emission is centrally - concentrated ( @xmath156 kpc in diameter ) in less - massive dark halos with a mass of @xmath157 m@xmath155 . because the typical dark halo mass of laes is estimated to be @xmath158 m@xmath155 ( @xcite and reference therein ) , the cold streams would not make an lah as large as @xmath159 kpc found in our data .",
    "the cold streams are probably not the major mechanism of the lah formation .      in section [ scale_lejgths_of_our_lahs_and_comparisons ] , we find differences of scale lengths between measurements of this and some previous studies .    first , at @xmath160 , the scale lengths from this study are smaller than those from @xcite by a factor of @xmath127 ( figure [ fig : size ] ) .",
    "note that the scale lengths of @xcite are estimated for their lbgs , while our study obtains the scale lengths of laes . by definition , ly@xmath0 emission of laes",
    "are brighter than that of lbgs , at a given sfr or uv continuum on average .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that the resonance line of ly@xmath0 can escape from galaxies with a low column density of neutral hydrogen in the cgm @xcite .",
    "this physical picture of ly@xmath0 escape is confirmed by recent imaging and spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "based on this picture , ly@xmath0 photons produced in star - forming regions of laes reach the observer with little resonant scattering .",
    "the observer thus finds that ly@xmath0 profiles of laes are more centrally concentrated than those of lbgs , and obtains a bright ly@xmath0 luminosity in the central core of ly@xmath0 profile of laes above the shallow detection limit of non - stacked images . on the other hand ,",
    "lbgs have more resonant scattering in the cgm than laes , and ly@xmath0 profiles of lbgs are largely extended .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the sb of lbgs of @xcite ( @xmath161 erg s@xmath9 @xmath17 hz@xmath9 arcsec@xmath18 at 30 kpc ) is one - order of magnitude brighter than that of our laes ( @xmath162 erg s@xmath9 @xmath17 hz@xmath9 arcsec@xmath18 at 30 kpc ) .",
    "the scale - length difference of our laes and @xcite s lbgs indicates that laes do not have much neutral hydrogen cgm that scatters ly@xmath0 , and that the ly@xmath0 profiles of laes are steeper than lbgs .",
    "second , at @xmath163 , the lah scale lengths of our laes are comparable with those of the lowest - density environment laes of @xcite , but lower than the highest - density environment laes of @xcite ( figure [ fig : size ] ) . here , the galaxy populations of our and @xcite s samples are the same .",
    "the difference of scale lengths is probably explained by the environment .",
    "clustering analysis with our lae samples indicates that our survey field at @xmath46 is not a high density region @xcite .",
    "our results confirm that low - density environment laes have a moderately small scale length of @xmath164 kpc , and support the idea of the environmental effect on lahs that is claimed by @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have predicted that the sb profiles are affected by the galaxy environment .",
    "@xcite have found the sb profiles of their lahs at @xmath14 have three notable features separated at two radial positions ; a central cusp at @xmath165 mpc ( co - moving ) , a relatively - flat part at @xmath166 mpc , and an outer steep region at @xmath167 mpc .",
    "the two radial positions of @xmath168 and @xmath169 mpc are characterized by the one- and two - halo terms of dark matter halos .",
    "however , we do not find such features in the radial profiles of our lahs .",
    "this is probably because our lahs at @xmath14 are only found within an inner region of @xmath170 mpc , and/or the clustering strength of the sxds field is weaker than that of zheng et al .",
    "( 2011 ; private communication ) .",
    "one needs deeper images than those of this study to investigate the environmental effect at the moderately high redshift of @xmath14 .",
    "we find no size evolution of lahs ( @xmath164 kpc ) from @xmath2 to @xmath5 as we describe in section [ size_evolution_of_lahs ] .",
    "@xcite have measured the half - light radii of stellar distribution of laes , @xmath171 , in the rest - frame uv , and found no size evolution ( @xmath172 kpc on average ) in the redshift range of @xmath173 .",
    "these two results indicate that the size ratio of lahs to stellar component is almost constant , @xmath174 , between @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "this ratio is comparable with those of @xmath160 lbgs ( @xmath175 ; @xcite ) and @xmath176 laes ( @xmath177 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the former lbg results indicate that there is a scaling relation between the lah and stellar - distribution sizes over the samples of lbgs and laes .",
    "the latter should be comparable , because these results include a low - density environment lae sample similar to ours .",
    "this no evolution of @xmath21 and @xmath178 at @xmath11 is interesting , because similar trends of no evolution of lae s physical properties are found in this redshift range .",
    "spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting of our lae samples have revealed that stellar population of our laes do not evolve significantly in the redshift range of @xmath11 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , hosting dark halos of laes are typically @xmath179 m@xmath155 at @xmath180 ( @xcite and reference therein ) , and do not evolve .",
    "these observational results of no evolution of @xmath21 , @xmath178 , stellar population , and dark halo mass would indicate that laes are the population in a specific stage of galaxy evolution , which nb observations can snapshot .",
    "we find a possible increase of scale length from @xmath14 to @xmath6 in section [ size_evolution_of_lahs ] ( see figure [ fig : size ] ) .",
    "again , clustering analysis with our laes indicates that our survey field at @xmath12 is not a high density region @xcite , and it is unlikely that this increase is due to the environmental effect .",
    "because there is no significant increase of scale lengths in the redshift range of @xmath11 , this sudden increase from @xmath14 to @xmath6 may be explained by cosmic reionization .",
    "signatures of the increase in the neutral hydrogen fraction of igm ( @xmath181 ) at @xmath182 have been found by many observational studies based on ly@xmath0 luminosity functions of laes or the gunn - perterson test of qsos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that ly@xmath0 emission around star - forming galaxies is extended due to the neutral hydrogen in the igm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have predicted that the sb profile of lahs becomes flatter in the igm with a high @xmath181 .",
    "the relatively large scale length of our lahs at @xmath12 may come from a more neutral igm at the epoch of reionization , although the reliability of increase is not very high in statistics ( figure [ fig : size ] ) and systematics ( section [ tests_for_all_systematic_errors ] ; see section [ size_evolution_of_lahs ] for the details ) . to conclude this trend",
    ", one needs a large amount of high - quality nb data such obtained by the upcoming survey of subaru hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) .",
    "we investigate diffuse lahs of laes with composite subaru nb images of ( @xmath63 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) laes at @xmath61 ( @xmath62 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , and discuss their physical origin and size evolution .",
    "the major results of our study are summarized below .    1 .",
    "we detect extended ly@xmath0 emission around laes at @xmath7 in the composite images .",
    "we carefully examine whether the radial profiles of ly@xmath0 emission can be made by systematic errors that include a large - scale psf of instrumental and atmospheric effects . stacking ly@xmath0 images of randomly - selected non - laes",
    ", we confirm that the combination of all systematic errors can not produce the extended ly@xmath0 emission in our composite images of all redshifts of @xmath7 , except for @xmath106 whose data have a quality poorer than the others .",
    "we thus conclude that the extended ly@xmath0 emission found in our composite images are real , and regard the extended ly@xmath0 emission as lahs .",
    "we investigate radial sb profiles of our lahs , and measure their characteristic exponential scale lengths .",
    "the scale lengths are estimated to be @xmath10 kpc at @xmath183 and 12.6@xmath184 kpc at @xmath12 for lae samples with @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 ( figure [ fig : size ] and table [ tab : z ] ) .",
    "the comparison with the lah scale lengths given by previous lbg and lae studies would indicate that the radial profiles of lahs depend on galaxy populations and environment : laes have a centrally - concentrated ly@xmath0 profile , and laes in low - density regions possess less extended lahs .",
    "we identify no evolution of scale lengths ( @xmath13 kpc ) from @xmath2 to @xmath5 beyond our measurement uncertainties . combining with no size evolution of lahs and uv continuum emission of laes found by @xcite ( @xmath172 kpc ) over @xmath185 , we suggest the ratio of @xmath178 to be nearly constant ( @xmath174 ) over the redshift range , @xmath11 .",
    "this no evolution of @xmath178 probably indicates that the population of laes at @xmath11 would be in the same evolutionary stage .",
    "we find a possible increase in the scale length from @xmath14 to @xmath6 .",
    "this sudden increase only found at @xmath186 may be a signature of increasing neutral hydrogen of igm that scatters ly@xmath0 photons due to the cosmic reionization .",
    "this finding would support the theoretical model predictions @xcite , although there remain the possible problems of statistical and systematic effects on the measurements of @xmath21 at @xmath12 .",
    "the upcoming surveys such with subaru hsc will allow us to test whether this hint of increase is real or not .",
