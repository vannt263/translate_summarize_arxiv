    "it is usually expected that any solution to the einstein field equations , describing realistic sources of gravitational field , has to satisfy the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "these conditions for a perfect fluid and for a viscous fluid have been widely used in some astrophysical and theoretical contexts @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent researches are focused on the magnetic and radiation fields contributions to the energy - momentum tensor , because they allow describing a wider variety of astrophysical scenarios ; for instance , the effect of a toroidal magnetic field on the equilibrium configurations of rotating neutron stars was treated in @xcite .",
    "the structure of neutron stars when strong magnetic fields are presented is studied in @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are also important for the production of relativistic jets , as it was showed in @xcite , where magnetohydrodynamic simulations in full general relativity were used to generate relativistic flows in binary neutron stars mergers with initial dipolar magnetic fields . on the other hand , in some astrophysical systems",
    "the radiation is dynamically important , as in the case of the collapse of massive stars to black holes @xcite , or the core - collapse supernovae , whose structure and dynamics is determined by the neutrino transport @xcite .",
    "additionally , the magnetic and radiation fields are key ingredients for giving a realistic description of the accretion of matter into a black hole",
    ". it was showed in @xcite that the radiative cooling processes should be considered for some accretion rates to reproduce the true dynamics of the disk .",
    "finally , the optically thick limit for accretion disks is introduced numerically to study the bondi @xcite and bondi - hoyle accretion @xcite to black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "one problem the relativistic eulerian magnetohydrodynamic codes have to face is the implementation of an atmosphere to avoid the presence of unphysical results when the rest mass density is too small , that is , to avoid the presence of vacuum regions in the numerical domain . in the practice ,",
    "what the different authors do is fix the value of the density @xmath0 and the velocity @xmath1 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , once @xmath4 @xcite , or set to zero the initial value of magnetic field , instead of the velocity , in the low density regions @xcite .",
    "this last numerical artifact is not well motivated ; that is why , the implementation of an atmosphere based on the energy conditions makes the numerical simulations more physically credible .",
    "for all these reasons , it becomes important to find the energy conditions for a perfect fluid with magnetic and radiation fields .",
    "the energy conditions for a viscous fluid were calculated in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , when the heat flux vector of the fluid is different from zero , the procedure to compute the energy conditions becomes more difficult . in 1988",
    "kolassis , santos , and tsoubelis found the conditions for the energy - momentum tensor of a viscous fluid with heat flux , written in the eckart approximation of small velocity gradients @xcite . to do it ,",
    "the authors diagonalized the energy - momentum tensor and wrote its energy conditions in terms of the corresponding eigenvalues @xcite . with this method ,",
    "it was necessary to deal with a fourth order polynomial equation , so additional assumptions were required in order to find the eigenvalues .",
    "recently , the energy conditions for the same dissipative fluid were found in @xcite , without considering any approximation on the velocity gradients .",
    "the used method leave the energy conditions free from restrictions and consists in diagonalize the spatial part of the energy - momentum tensor , compute the physical quantities as measured by an arbitrary observer , and finally , to write the conditions so that they are independent of the observer .",
    "now , in this work we are going to find the energy conditions for a perfect fluid with magnetic and radiation field by using the same algebraic procedure developed in @xcite , that leaves the conditions independent from the 4-velocity of the observer .",
    "the organization of this work is the following : we present in section [ sec : emt ] the energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid with magnetic and radiation fields , for which we are going to compute the energy conditions .",
    "we also discuss briefly the assumptions we made for each field and its physical motivation . in section [ sec : ec ] , we compute the energy density and the isotropic pressure of the total system , because in terms of this quantities the energy - momentum tensor can be written in a similar fashion as the one of a viscous fluid with heat flux . following the procedure presented in @xcite",
    ", we find the energy conditions for the gravitational system consisting of a magnetized fluid with radiation field . as a particular case",
    ", we suppose the radiation contribution equals to zero in order to find the energy conditions for a perfect fluid with magnetic field .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss about the main results of this work . in this work",
    ", we will work with the signature @xmath5 , and with units in which the gravitational constant @xmath6 and the speed of light @xmath7 are equal to one .",
    "in this section we are going to present the energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid with magnetic and radiation fields .",
    "this tensor can be splitted into three terms , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the energy - momentum tensors of the fluid , the magnetic field , and the radiation field , respectively .",
    "now , we will introduce each tensor by separately , presenting the approximations and assumptions for each contribution .    1 .",
    "_ the fluid contribution _    we are going to compute the energy conditions for a non - dissipative matter field in which the energy fluxes are zero and there are not anisotropic stresses . in this case",
    ", the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the four - velocity vector of the fluid , @xmath0 is the energy density in the comoving frame , and @xmath14 is the thermal pressure of the fluid , also measured by the comoving observer .",
    "a fluid described by ( [ m_fluid ] ) is commonly know as _ perfect fluid _ , and is widely used to model the average properties of isolated rotating relativistic stars @xcite , and to study the fluid dynamics around compact objects @xcite .    1 .",
    "_ the magnetic field contribution _",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field is given by the following expression , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the faraday tensor , whose covariant components are @xmath17 so we can compute the electric field and the magnetic field via the relations @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the levi - civita tensorial density .",
    "on the other hand , according to the ohm s law , the conduction current , @xmath20 , is related to the electric field through the constitutive relation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the conductivity .",
    "now , if we suppose that the material is a perfect conductor , then @xmath23 , and the only way to have a finite conduction current in ( [ ohm ] ) is that @xmath24 .",
    "this approximation is the basis for the ideal magnetohydrodynamics , which is very useful to describe highly conducting astrophysical fluids where the effect of the magnetic field can not be neglected , such as neutron stars , accretion fluids , magnetized winds , etc @xcite . as a consequence of this approximation , @xmath25",
    "; so it is possible to write the faraday tensor in terms of the magnetic field as @xmath26 in such a way that the energy - momentum tensor ( [ energy - electromagnetic ] ) reduces to @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the 4-vector @xmath30 is spacelike and satisfies the property @xmath31 .",
    "the tensor @xmath10 describes the energy and the momentum of the magnetic field in a well - conductor fluid .    1 .   _",
    "the radiation field contribution _",
    "the last term in the right hand side of ( [ energy - momentum1 ] ) , which describes the energy and the momentum of the radiation field , is given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the specific intensity of the radiation at position @xmath34 with frequency @xmath35 and moving in the direction @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the photon four - momentum , @xmath38 is the planck constant , and @xmath39 is the differential of solid angle ; @xmath35 , @xmath40 and @xmath39 are measured in a comoving frame . moreover , since the photon propagation direction becomes @xmath41 , @xmath42 , in this comoving frame @xcite , we can define the radiation moments @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the radiation energy density , @xmath43 the radiation flux , @xmath44 and the radiation stress tensor , @xmath45    now , many current numerical codes are devoted to describe systems such as relativistic stars or high density fluids in which the photons free paths are small , and therefore they interact with the material and diffuse through it . as a consequence",
    ", the radiation is trapped in the interior of the compact object and @xmath40 becomes isotropic , so that @xmath46 @xcite . under this limit of isotropy ,",
    "widely known as the optically thick regime , the radiation stress tensor becomes @xmath47 with @xmath48 , and the radiation flux vector vanishes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , allowing @xmath49 to have small non - zero values , we introduce a small anisotropy but retain the expression ( [ stress_tensor_otl ] ) for the radiation stress tensor , so the radiation field is only approximately isotropic .",
    "henceforth , we will concern only on gravitational systems in which the optically thick regime is approximately valid .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the radiation field in such a systems can be written in a covariant form as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the radiation flux four - vector which is defined as @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the induced metric of the normal space to the 4-velocity @xmath13 , so it is easy to show that @xmath54 .    finally , replacing ( [ m_fluid ] ) , ( [ mag_fluid ] ) , and ( [ emt_raditaion_otl ] ) in ( [ energy - momentum1 ] ) we obtain @xcite @xmath55 which is the total energy - momentum tensor for a perfect magneto - fluid with a radiation field .",
    "now , we are interested in finding the energy conditions for a fluid described by ( [ total_energy_momentum ] ) .",
    "these conditions are restrictions on the energy - momentum tensor that ensure the solutions to the einstein equations to describe realistic gravitational systems .",
    "we can briefly formulate the energy conditions as @xcite    * _ the weak energy condition : _ the energy density , @xmath56 , measured by an arbitrary observer , defined by its four - velocity vector @xmath57 , must be positive , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath58 * _ the strong energy condition : _ any timelike or null congruence of geodesics must be convergent , thus , @xmath59 this condition ensures the attractive nature of the gravitational field .",
    "* _ the dominant energy condition : _ the energy flux density measured by an arbitrary observer , @xmath60 must be a future oriented timelike or null vector .",
    "this means that @xmath61    therefore , the aim of this section is to write this conditions in terms of the energy density and pressure of the fluid , the energy density and pressure of the radiation , the radiation flux vector , and the magnetic field .",
    "there are two ways for addressing the problem .",
    "the first one is to rewrite the energy conditions in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , computing the eigenvalues of ( [ total_energy_momentum ] ) is a difficult task because we need to deal with a fourth - order polynomial , so it becomes necessary to impose additional restrictions on the energy - momentum tensor in order to find solutions .",
    "the other way for finding the energy conditions is to define an orthonormal basis in which the spatial part of @xmath62 ( the one associated with the normal and tangential stresses ) becomes diagonal . in this basis",
    ", the four - velocity @xmath57 has arbitrary components , and therefore , the energy conditions are written in terms of these components ( cf .",
    "[ wec ] - [ dec2 ] ) . then , with the aim of ensuring the invariance of the energy conditions , it is necessary to apply algebraic procedures to decouple them from the components of @xmath57 .",
    "this last method was applied in @xcite in order to find the energy conditions for a viscous fluid with heat flux .    in this paper",
    ", we are going to use the same method used in @xcite , but now with the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect magneto - fluid with radiation field ( [ total_energy_momentum ] ) . to do it , we start by computing the total energy of the system , @xmath63 , measured by a comoving observer , @xmath64 we also compute the isotropic pressure @xcite , which is written via the spatial trace of the energy - momentum tensor as @xmath65 with @xmath63 and @xmath66 we find that the proportional term to @xmath67 in ( [ total_energy_momentum ] ) can be written as @xmath68 in a similar way , the term in parenthesis accompanying the metric tensor in ( [ total_energy_momentum ] ) is related to @xmath69 through @xmath70    now , with ( [ first_term ] ) and ( [ second_term ] ) , the energy - momentum tensor ( [ total_energy_momentum ] ) becomes @xmath71 where we have defined the deviatoric tensor @xmath72 it is important to note that @xmath73 satisfies the same properties of the deviatoric stress tensor from relativistic fluid dynamics @xcite : it is traceless and its projection along @xmath74 is zero , so @xmath75 respectively .",
    "finally , if we introduce the stress tensor @xmath76 then ( [ total_t_v1 ] ) reduces to @xmath77 which has the same form as the one of the energy - momentum tensor for a viscous fluid with heat flux @xcite .",
    "this make sense since the term @xmath78 may introduce tangential stresses due to the magnetic field , in a similar manner as the deviatoric stress tensor does for a viscous fluid .",
    "additionally , the radiation flux vector , @xmath51 , plays an analogous roll to the one of the heat flux vector .",
    "the tensor @xmath79 is the spatial part of @xmath62 ; therefore , it describes the normal and tangential stresses due to the fluid , the magnetic field , and the radiation field .",
    "we can find an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors @xmath80 in which @xmath79 takes the diagonal form , @xmath81 where , @xmath82 , @xmath83 are the eigenvalues . in this basis of eigenvectors , the radiation flux and the magnetic field have arbitrary components , so , @xmath84 in such a way that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "additionally , in the orthonormal tetrad @xmath87 , the four - velocity vector of the arbitrary observer takes the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath83 satisfy the relation @xmath91 , with @xmath92 . finally ,",
    "the eigenvalues , @xmath82 can be computed as follows : @xmath93 where the different magnetic components are the responsible for the anisotropy of @xmath79 , because in general , @xmath94 .",
    "the following step is to use ( [ t_final_v ] ) and ( [ velocity_observer ] ) to write the inequalities ( [ wec ] - [ dec2 ] ) and try to develop an algebraic procedure to decouple the energy conditions from the components of @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , this algebraic procedure will be the same as the one used in @xcite to find the energy conditions for a viscous fluid with heat flux .",
    "hence , we can state that the energy conditions for the energy - momentum tensor presented in ( [ t_final_v ] ) are @xmath95 therefore , using ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ isotropic_pressure ] ) , and ( [ iso1]-[iso3 ] ) , the energy conditions for a perfect magneto - fluid with radiation field are @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 with the inequalities ( [ e111 ] ) , ( [ e222 ] ) , and ( [ e333 ] ) the weak energy condition and the strong energy condition are both satisfied ; while the dominant energy condition is equivalent to ( [ e555 ] ) .    as a particular case , when @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the radiation field vanishes , and ( [ e111]-[e555 ] ) reduce to @xmath103 these energy conditions are also of astrophysical and numerical interest because they may be applied to the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid with an arbitrary magnetic field .",
    "we have obtained the energy conditions for a perfect fluid with magnetic and radiation fields , whose physical description is the main objective of the _ general relativistic radiation magneto - hydrodynamics_. we first presented the energy - momentum tensor of the total system ( [ total_energy_momentum ] ) , consisting of the fluid , the magnetic field , and the radiation field . with this tensor",
    ", we computed the energy density of the system , by projecting ( [ total_energy_momentum ] ) along the four - velocity vector of the fluid , and the isotropic pressure , which is defined through the spatial trace of ( [ total_energy_momentum ] ) . by writing the energy - momentum tensor in terms of these quantities",
    ", we realized that the magnetic field introduces an anisotropic term , @xmath73 , to the stress tensor of the fluid ( [ stress_tensor ] ) , in the same way as the deviatoric stress tensor does for a viscous fluid .    by writing the four - velocity vector of the arbitrary observer @xmath57 in the comoving tetrad , where the stress tensor ( [ stress_tensor ] ) is diagonal",
    ", we can compute the energy density @xmath56 , the energy flux density @xmath104 , and the scalar @xmath105 , as measured by this observer . then , by applying the same algebraic procedure presented in @xcite , we showed that the weak , and strong energy conditions are satisfied if ( [ e111]-[e333 ] ) are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "we also showed that the dominant energy condition , for the system of interest , is equivalent to the inequality ( [ e555 ] ) .",
    "as a particular case , when @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , the radiation field vanishes , and the energy conditions reduce to those presented in ( [ e1]-[e5 ] ) , and correspond to a perfect fluid with magnetic field .",
    "these conditions are useful since many numerical simulations are carried out using this fluid as a test fluid in a curved spacetime background , or as a source of gravitational field to model the average properties of neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
