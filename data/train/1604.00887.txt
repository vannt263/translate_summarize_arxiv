    "decades ago @xcite and @xcite suggested that there is a separation in the duration distribution of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . today",
    "it is widely accepted that the physics of the short and long grbs are different , and these two kinds of grbs are different phenomena @xcite .    in the third batse catalog @xcite",
    " using uni- and multi - variate analyses  @xcite and @xcite found a third type of grbs .",
    "later several papers @xcite confirmed the existence of this third ( `` intermediate '' in duration ) group in the same database . in the swift data the intermediate class has also been found @xcite .",
    "there are also more recent works @xcite in this field .    in the swift database , the measured redshift distribution for the two groups are also different , for short burst",
    "the median is 0.4 @xcite and for the long ones it is 2.4 @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly summarizes the method and fits , section 3 contains the calculations of the fits and their results , section 4 contains the comparison of the redshift distributions of the different classes and section 5 summarizes the conclusions of this paper .",
    "on the swift web page there are 997 grbs ; 957 of these bursts were catalogued prior to october 2015 .",
    "multi - variate analyses have demonstrated that flux and fluence values are also needed for a robust classification .",
    "there were 30 grbs without fluence information and 19 grbs without peak flux information .",
    "another 20 grbs are excluded from this analysis because their fluence uncertainties are larger than 50% .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath0 ( time to accumulate the central 90% of the burst fluence ) distribution of the remaining 888 grbs .    the maximum likelihood ( ml ) method assumes that the probability density function of an @xmath1 observable variable is given in the form of @xmath2 where @xmath3 are parameters of unknown value .",
    "having @xmath4 observations on @xmath1 , one can define the likelihood function in the following form :    @xmath5    or in logarithmic form ( the logarithmic form is more convenient for calculations ) :    @xmath6    the ml procedure maximizes @xmath7 according to @xmath3 .",
    "since the logarithmic function is monotonic , the logarithm reaches its maximum at the same @xmath3 parameter set where @xmath8 does .",
    "the confidence region of the estimated parameters is given by the following formula , where @xmath9 is the maximum value of the likelihood function and @xmath10 is the likelihood function at the true value of the parameters @xcite :    @xmath11",
    "@xmath12    similar to our previous work @xcite , we fit the @xmath13 distribution using ml with a superposition of @xmath14 log - normal components , each of them having two unknown parameters to be fitted with @xmath15 measured points .",
    "the choice to use log - normal functions to fit the duration distribution is based on the results of @xcite .",
    "our goal is to find the minimum value of @xmath14 suitable to fit the observed distribution . assuming a weighted superposition of @xmath14 log - normal distributions , one has to maximize the following likelihood function :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a weight and @xmath18 is a log - normal function with @xmath19 mean and @xmath20 standard deviation having the form of    @xmath21    and due to a normalization condition    @xmath22    we used a simple c++ code to find the maximum of @xmath23 . assuming only one log - normal component",
    ", the fit gives @xmath24 but in the case of @xmath14 = 2 one gets @xmath25 with the parameters given in table  1 .",
    "the solution is displayed in fig .  2 .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) we can infer whether the addition of a further log - normal component is necessary to significantly improve the fit .",
    "we make the null hypothesis that we have already reached the the true value of @xmath14 . adding a new component , i.e. moving from @xmath14 to @xmath26 ,",
    "the ml solution of @xmath27 has changed to @xmath28 , but @xmath10 remained the same . in the meantime",
    "we increased the number of parameters with 3 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) on both @xmath27 and @xmath28 we get after subtraction    @xmath32    for @xmath33 , @xmath34 is greater than @xmath35 by more than 100 , which gives for @xmath36 an extremely low probability .",
    "it means that the fit with two log - normal distributions is really a better approximation for the duration distribution of grbs than the fit with one .",
    "thirdly , a three - log - normal fit is made combining three @xmath37 functions with eight parameters ( three means , three standard deviations and two independent weights ) .",
    "for the best fitted parameters see table 2 .",
    "the highest value of the logarithm of the likelihood ( @xmath38 ) is 5098.361 . for two log - normal functions the maximum is 5082.246 .",
    "the maximum has thus improved by 16 .",
    "twice this value is 32 , which gives us a probability of 0.00006% for the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath38 being only by chance .",
    "therefore , there is a high probability that a third log - normal distribution is needed .",
    "in other words , the three - log - normal fit ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is better and there is a 0.0000006 probability that it was caused only by statistical fluctuation .",
    "@xmath39    in one of our previous papers @xcite , we published a similar analysis on 222 grbs of the first bat catalog .",
    "one should compare these results with the results published in that paper .",
    "the centers of the distributions change by only a very small amount . in the current analysis ,",
    "the center of the distribution of the short bursts is at -0.508 ( 0.311 s ) which was previously at -0.473 ( 0.336 s ) . for the intermediate ones ,",
    "the center is at 1.076 which was at 1.107 and for the long bursts at 1.897 , which was at 1.903 in our previous analysis .",
    "the relative frequencies of the distribution of the groups now are 8% for short , 35% for intermediate and 57% for long bursts ( see table 2 ) . using a sample four times smaller in 2008 @xcite ,",
    "the relative frequencies of the distribution of the groups were 7% for short , 35% for intermediate and 58% for long bursts .",
    "therefore , both analyses give us very similar results .",
    "this does not mean that the three - gaussian is the best approximation for the duration distribution of the grbs , but strongly suggests that the smaller and the larger sample duration distributions are almost the same . neither the nature of the grbs nor the swift detectors changed during the years .",
    "one should also calculate the likelihood for four log - normal functions .",
    "the best logarithm of the ml is 5098.990 .",
    "it is larger with 0.63 than it was for three log - normal functions .",
    "this gives us a low significance ( 26% ) , therefore the fourth component is not needed . in table 3",
    "we summarize the improvement of the likelihood and the corresponding significances .",
    "among the 888 grbs there are 269 grbs which have redshift information .",
    "since the duration distribution of the three groups overlap one can not be sure to which group does a specific burst belong .",
    "however , 2.5 s ( 0.4 in logarithmic scale ) and 31.6 s ( 1.5 in logarithmic scale ) seems to be an approximate border between the short , intermediate and long gbrs . using these borders",
    ", there are 20 short , 79 intermediate and 170 long grbs .",
    "we cut the biggest population , the long burst group , into two parts : shorter than 100 s ( 91 grbs ) and longer than 100 s ( 79 grbs ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution of the short , intermediate , long1 and long2 bursts .",
    "one can use the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to compare the distributions .",
    "the redshift distribution of the intermediate , the long1 and the long2 groups do not differ from each other .",
    "the probabilities can be seen in table 4 .",
    "however , the observed redshift distribution of the short bursts differs from the other three distributions with high significance ( more than 99.9 % ) .",
    "this latter result is well - known in the literature . for the intermediate bursts",
    ", there was a suggestion with a very low significance that the redshift distribution of these bursts are different from the redshift distribution of the long grbs .",
    "based on the results discussed above , we are not able to confirm this suggestion",
    ". the redshift distributions of the long and the intermediate grbs seem to be very similar .",
    "we presented that fitting the duration distribution of 888 swift bat grbs with three log - normal functions is better than the fit using only two . though this may be the result of statistical fluctuations and maybe there are only two types of grbs , the probability that the third component is not needed is only 0.00006% .",
    "one can compare the parameters of the burst groups with previous results . in @xcite the relative frequencies were 7% for short , 35% for intermediate and 58% for long bursts .",
    "now our results show 8% for short , 35% for intermediate and 57% for long ones .",
    "the center of the groups are also nearly the same .",
    "we have shown with very high significance that the redshift distribution of the short bursts is different from the redshift distributions of the other ( longer ) grbs .",
    "however , the redshift distribution of the intermediate grbs seems to be similar to the redshift distribution of the long grbs .",
