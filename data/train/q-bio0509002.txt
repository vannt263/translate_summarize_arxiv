    "one of the more interesting aspects of evolution at high mutation rates is the possible emergence of a _ quasispecies_. originally formulated by eigen and schuster @xcite , the quasispecies model describes how natural selection may act on a group of related genotypes that are coupled via mutations , rather than on each genotype independently .",
    "this model is most relevant when the product of population size and genomic mutation rate exceeds one , so that new mutants are introduced into the population in each generation . in this context ,",
    "robustness to mutations can be seen as a beneficial trait , and selection for this robustness is invariably associated with the emergence of a quasispecies . because rna viruses have mutation rates in the range that is relevant for quasispecies theory  ,",
    "quasispecies models have been used to describe the dynamics of rna virus populations . however ,",
    "this use has generated criticism because quasispecies theory , as it was originally developed , assumes an infinite population size and predicts deterministic dynamics .",
    "viral populations , on the other hand , are finite and subject to stochastic dynamics and neutral drift .",
    "however , the hallmark of quasispecies dynamics  the existence of a mutationally coupled population that is the target of selection in its entirety  does not presuppose an infinite population size or the absence of neutral drift  .",
    "rather , infinite populations were used by eigen  @xcite and eigen and schuster  @xcite to simplify the mathematics of the coupled differential equations describing the population dynamics .",
    "even though technically the quasispecies solution of eigen and schuster , defined as the largest eigenvector of a suitable matrix of transition probabilities , only exists for infinite populations after an infinitely long equilibration period , it would be wrong to conclude that the cooperative population structure induced by mutational coupling would disappear when the population is finite .",
    "we show here that quasispecies dynamics are evident in fairly small populations ( effective population size @xmath0 ) , and that these dynamics cross over to pure neutral drift in a continuous manner as the population size decreases .",
    "we investigate the presence of quasispecies dynamics by simulating populations of self - replicating rna sequences , and looking for an unequivocal marker for quasispecies dynamics in this system , the selection of mutational robustness  .",
    "we choose rna secondary structure folding as a fitness determinant because it is a well - studied model   in which the mapping from sequence to phenotype is not trivial .",
    "the non - triviality of this mapping is crucial for the formation of a quasispecies , as we explain in more detail below .",
    "we consider rna sequences that fold into a specific target secondary structure as viable , and all other rna sequences as non - viable .",
    "we choose a neutral fitness model , that is , one where the replicative speed of all viable sequences is identical and set equal to one , in order to be able to study quasispecies dynamics exclusively ( non - viable sequences have fitness zero ) . if there were fitness differences among viable sequences ( i.e. , if the fitness landscape contained peaks of different heights ) , then adaptive events leading to higher peaks could dominate the evolutionary dynamics . in the neutral landscape ,",
    "all peaks are of equal height , but some peaks are wider than others .",
    "thus , we can describe the rna folding landscape as a network of neutral sequences  .",
    "the viable sequences form a network in genotype space , i.e. , a graph that results from including all viable sequences as vertices , and including an edge between two such vertices if a single mutation can interconvert the two sequences . for each sequence , the probability of a mutation being neutral rather than lethal",
    "is called the sequence s _ neutrality_. in the absence of differential fitness among the viable sequences , differences in sequences neutrality becomes the target of natural selection , that is , we observe selection for mutational robustness .    in our model ,",
    "since individual sequences have either fitness 0 or 1 , the average fitness of the population is equal to the fraction of viable sequences in the population .",
    "an increase in the average fitness therefore indicates that the sequences in the population have become more robust to mutations . in order to detect selection for mutational robustness",
    ", we look for abrupt transitions of the adapting population to higher average fitness , after allowing for an initial equilibration period . for a purely neutrally drifting swarm of sequences such transitions can not exist , although stochastic effects can mimic such transitions if the population size is small .",
    "if we observe transitions in average fitness above the background level expected from stochastic fluctuations , we can ascribe these transitions to the discovery of a region of higher neutrality on the neutral network . in this case",
    ", the transition to higher average fitness corresponds to the outcompetition of the previous quasispecies by a more mutationally robust one .",
    "we consider a population of fixed size @xmath1 composed of asexual replicators whose probability of reproduction in each generation is proportional to their fitness ( wright - fisher sampling ) .",
    "the members of the population are rna sequences of length @xmath2 , and their fitness @xmath3 is solely a function of their secondary structure . those that fold into a specific target secondary structure are deemed viable with fitness @xmath4 , while those that fold into any other shape are non - viable ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the average fitness @xmath6 of the population is therefore the fraction of living members out of the total population .",
    "rna sequences are folded into the minimum free energy structure using the vienna package  , and dangling ends are given zero free energy . for a given simulation",
    ", an initial rna sequence is selected uniformly at random and its minimum - energy secondary structure defines the target structure for this simulation , thereby determining a neutral network on which the population evolves for a time of @xmath7,000 generations .",
    "mutations occur during reproduction with a fixed probability @xmath8 per site , corresponding to an average genomic mutation rate @xmath9 .",
    "our simulations spanned a range of genomic mutation rates and population sizes , and we performed @xmath10 independent replicates for each of the pairs @xmath11 , starting each with a different randomly chosen initial sequence . to study mutation rate effects , we considered a fixed population size of @xmath12 , across a range of genomic mutation rates , using @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to study effects due to finite population size",
    ", we considered a fixed mutation rate of @xmath15 , using population sizes of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the neutrality of a sequence was determined by calculating the fraction of mutations that did not change the minimum - energy secondary structure .",
    "thus , if @xmath18 of all @xmath19 one - point mutants of a sequence retain their structure , the neutrality of that sequence is given by @xmath20 . because sequences that do nt fold into the target structure have zero fitness , a sequence s neutrality is equal to the mean fitness of all possible single mutants",
    "we recorded the population s average fitness every generation , while the population s average neutrality , being much more computationally expensive , was calculated only at the start and end of each replicate . for illustrative purposes , select replicates of interest were recreated using the original random seed , and the population s neutrality was recorded every 100 generations .    to observe the signature of natural selection acting within our system ,",
    "we derive a statistical approach to identify transitions in the population s average fitness @xmath6 .",
    "if a beneficial mutation appears and is subsequently fixated in the population , we expect to observe a step increase in the population s average fitness .",
    "we emphasize again that such selective sweeps must be due to periodic selection of quasispecies for increased mutational robustness , since there are no fitness differences between individual genotypes .    in light of the fluctuations in the population s average fitness due to mutations and finite population effects , we employ statistical methods to estimate the time at which the beneficial mutation occurred and associate a @xmath21-value with our level of confidence that a transition has occurred .",
    "our approach can be thought of as a generalization of the test for differing means between two populations ( those before and after the mutation ) , except that the time of the mutation s occurrence is unknown _ a priori_. for a full derivation and discussion of our approach ,",
    "see the appendix . while our alogrithm can be applied recursively to test for and identify multiple transitions that may occur in a single simulation , unless otherwise noted , we considered only the single most significant step found .",
    "because replicates were initialized with @xmath1 ( possibly mutated ) offspring of the randomly chosen ancestor , the simulation runs did not start in mutation  selection balance .",
    "typically , we observed an initial equilibration period of 50 to 200 generations , after which the population s fitness and neutrality stabilized , with fluctuations continuing with magnitude in proportion to the mutation rate .",
    "as predicted by van nimwegen et al .",
    "@xcite , during the equilibration period , we observed in most replicates beneficial mutations that increased the equilibrium level of both average fitness and neutrality .",
    "( throughout this paper , by beneficial mutations we mean mutations that increase a sequence s neutrality , and thus indirectly the mean fitness of the population .",
    "there are no mutations that increase the fitness of a viable sequence beyond the value 1 in our system . )",
    "these mutations led to the initial formation of a quasispecies on a high - neutrality region of the neutral network .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , we are not interested in this initial equilibration , but in transitions towards more densely connected areas of the neutral network once the initial equilibration has occurred .    to determine if such a transition has occurred , we need a method to distinguish significant changes in the population s mean fitness from apparent transitions caused by statistical fluctuations .",
    "we devised a statistical test ( see appendix for details ) that can identify such transitions and assign a @xmath21-value to each event .",
    "we found that transitions to higher average fitness occurred in over 80% of simulations across all mutation rates studied , if we considered all transitions with @xmath21-values of @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ fig : step ] shows a particularly striking example of such a transition ( @xmath21-value @xmath23 ) , where a 5.0% increase in average fitness occurs at @xmath24 . a similar analysis of the average neutrality ( not usually available , but computed every generation specifically in this case ) finds an increase of 11.2% occurring at @xmath25 , with the same level of confidence .",
    "the multiple transitions shown in the figure  [ fig : step ] are the results of recursively applying our step - finding algorithm until no steps are found with @xmath26 .",
    "depending on the mutation rate , a step size as little as 0.04% in the population s average fitness could be statistically resolved in a background of fitness fluctuations several times this size . for comparison , typical noise levels , as indicated by the ratio of the standard deviation of the fitness to its mean , ranged from 0.7 to 6.6% over the mutation rates studied .",
    "note that fluctuations in the neutrality level are much smaller , due to the additional averaging involved .",
    "however , because neutrality is much more expensive computationally , and would also be difficult to measure in experimental viral populations , we used mean fitness as an indicator of transitions throughout this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : avg_step ] shows the average size of the most significant step observed as a function of the mutation rate . at low mutation rates , such as @xmath27 , the smaller",
    "observed step size corresponds to the fact that @xmath28 of the population is reproducing without error , and hence improvements in neutrality can only increase the population s fitness in the small fraction of cases when a mutation occurs . at higher mutation rates",
    "the step sizes increase , reflecting the larger beneficial effect of increased neutrality under these conditions .    in about @xmath29 of all simulations with statistically significant changes in fitness ,",
    "the most significant change in fitness was actually a step _ down _ , that is , a fitness loss , rather than the increase in fitness typically observed .",
    "negative steps in average fitness occur due to stochastic fixation of detrimental mutations at small population sizes @xcite .",
    "these negative fitness steps , however , are generally much smaller than the typical positive step size .",
    "the average size of these negative steps was between 0.09 and 0.77% , compared with an average positive step size between 0.27 and 2.33% ( see figure  [ fig : neg_step ] ) .",
    "we specifically studied the role of finite population size and its effects on neutral drift by considering populations of size @xmath30 , 100 , 300 , and 1000 at a constant genomic mutation rate of @xmath15 .",
    "we again performed 50 replicates at each population size , and the distribution of statistically significant step sizes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : step_dist ] ( biggest step only ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : step_dist_all ] ( all steps ) .",
    "while the larger population s distributions show a clear bias towards positive steps in fitness , the distributions become increasingly symmetric about zero for smaller population sizes .",
    "a gap around zero fitness change becomes increasingly pronounced in smaller populations , as the fluctuations in fitness due to finite population size preclude us from statistically distinguishing small step sizes from the null hypothesis that no step has occurred .",
    "we also kept track of the consensus sequence in our simulations , to determine whether the population underwent drift while under selection for mutational robustness . in the runs with @xmath12 , the consensus sequence accumulated on average one substitution every 2 to 3 generations .",
    "as such rapid change might be caused by sampling effects , we also studied the speed at which the consensus sequence changed over larger time windows . using this method with window lengths of 50 and 100 generations",
    ", we found that the consensus sequence accumulated one substitution every 10 to 20 generations ( window size 50 generations ) or 15 to 30 generations ( window size 100 generations ) .",
    "thus we find that the populations continue to drift rapidly throughout the simulation runs , and never settle down to a stable consensus sequence .",
    "figure  [ fig : consensus ] shows the evolution of the consensus sequence over time for the same simulation run as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : step ] .    finally , to confirm that our finite population was not sampling the entire neutral network during our simulations",
    ", we estimated the average size of the neutral network .",
    "we can represent each rna secondary structure in dot - and - parenthesis notation , where matched parentheses indicate a bond between the bases at those points in the sequence and dots represent unpaired bases .",
    "the number of valid strings of length @xmath31 can be counted using catalan numbers @xmath32 , which give the number of ways to open and close @xmath33 pairs of parentheses @xcite .",
    "since there are @xmath34 possible rna sequences , we obtain for the average network @xmath35 } { \\mathrm{cat}}(i ) \\binom{l}{l-2i } \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{12}\\ ] ] for @xmath2 .",
    "this expression is a lower bound to the true average network size , because the denominator counts some unphysical structures , such as hairpins wiht fewer than 3 bases . for comparison ,",
    "the number of possible distinct genotypes that can appear in each simulation is maximally @xmath36 .",
    "in the study of varying mutation rates , the observed increases in the population s fitness in almost all replicates demonstrate the action of natural selection .",
    "since all viable sequences are neutral and hence enjoy no reproductive fitness advantage , this selection acts on increasing the population s robustness to mutations through increases in its average neutrality ( as seen in figure  [ fig : step ] ) .",
    "thus , these results show evidence that a quasispecies is present in almost all cases , even though the difference between a randomly drifting swarm and a population structured as a quasispecies decreases as the population size and mutation rate decrease . our results also show evidence of neutral drift leading to the fixation of detrimental mutations in some populations .",
    "the negative steps observed ( figure  [ fig : neg_step ] ) were comparable in size to @xmath37 , the probability of a neutral mutation drifting to fixation .",
    "in the study of varying population sizes , the distribution of mutational effects on fitness showed an increasing bias towards beneficial rather than detrimental mutations as the population s size increased ( figures  [ fig : step_dist ] ,  [ fig : step_dist_all ] ) . at population sizes 100 , 300 , and 1000",
    ", the clear positive bias of mutational effects illustrates the presence of a quasispecies , where natural selection is able to act to improve the population s neutrality and hence its robustness to mutations .",
    "as the fluctuations in fitness due to small population size become more significant , selection for neutrality becomes less relevant when the @xmath37 sampling noise exceeds the typical step size of 1% . at the smallest population size of @xmath38",
    ", there still seems to be a bias towards beneficial mutations , but the evidence is less clear and more replicates are probably necessary to observe a clear signal of quasispecies dynamics .",
    "since the average network size is many orders of magnitude larger than the number of sequences produced during a simulation , we know that the system is non - ergodic and the population can not possibly have explored the whole neutral network . moreover , reidys et al .",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of neutral network sizes in rna secondary structure and found that they obey a power law distribution , implying that there are a small number of very large networks , and many smaller networks .",
    "as a consequence , choosing an arbitrary initial sequence will more likely result in the choice of a large network .",
    "therefore , eq .   is effectively a lower bound on the sizes of the networks we actually sampled .",
    "we have shown that quasispecies dynamics is not confined to the infinite population - size limit .",
    "instead , one of the hallmarks of quasispecies evolution  the periodic selection of more mutationally robust quasispecies in a neutral fitness landscape  occurs at population sizes very significantly smaller than the size of the neutral network they inhabit . despite small population sizes ,",
    "if the mutation rate is sufficiently high ( in the simulations reported here , it appears that @xmath39 is sufficient ) , stable frequency distributions significantly different from random develop on the partially occupied network in response to mutational pressure .",
    "most importantly , we have shown that genetic drift can occur simultaneously with quasispecies selection , and becomes dominant as @xmath40 decreases .",
    "thus , the notion that genetic drift and quasispecies dynamics are mutually exclusive can not be maintained .",
    "instead , we find that both quasispecies dynamics and neutral drift occur at all finite population sizes and mutation rates , but that their relative importance changes",
    ".    the existence of a stable consensus sequence in the presence of high sequence heterogeneity has long been used as an indicator of quasispecies dynamics . here , we have shown that quasispecies dynamics can be present while the consensus sequence changes over time . in our simulations ,",
    "the consensus sequence drifts randomly , in a manner uncorrelated with the transitions in average fitness that we detect .",
    "thus , quasispecies dynamics does not require individual mutants to be stably represented in the population , nor does it require a stable consensus sequence .    the population structure on the neutral network is strongly influenced by the mutational coupling of the genotypes that constitute the quasispecies .",
    "this coupling arises because mutations are not independent in the landscape we studied .",
    "rather , as in most complex fitness landscapes , single mutations at one locus can affect the fitness effect of mutations at another ( a sign of epistasis ,  ) .",
    "in the neutral fitness landscape investigated here , mutations at neutral or non - neutral ( i.e. , lethal ) sites can influence the neutrality of the sequence . the absence of epistatic interactions between the neutral mutations in the fitness landscape studied by jenkins et al .",
    "@xcite implies the absence of quasispecies dynamics in these simulations .",
    "theoretical arguments show that a non - interacting neutral region in a genome does not alter the eigenvectors of the matrix of transition probabilities , and therefore can not affect quasispecies dynamics .    using fitness transitions in neutral fitness landscapes as a tool to diagnose the presence of a quasispecies has a number of interesting consequences from a methodological point of view . clearly ,",
    "because selection for robustness is a sufficient criterion for quasispecies dynamics but not a necessary one , the absence of a transition does not imply the absence of a quasispecies . at the same time , as the population size decreases , fluctuations in fitness become more pronounced , rendering the detection of a transition more and more difficult .",
    "theoretical and numerical arguments suggest that small populations at high mutation rate can not maintain a quasispecies  , so the disappearance of the mutational robustness signal at small population sizes is consistent with the disappearance of the quasispecies .",
    "however , the type of analysis carried out in this work does not lend itself to detecting quasispecies in real evolving rna populations , because the fitness landscape there can not be expected to be strictly neutral . instead",
    ", transitions from one peak to another of different height  @xcite are likely to dominate .",
    "quasispecies selection transitions such as the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : step ] can , in principle , be distinguished from peak - shift transitions in that every sequence before and after the transition should have the same fitness .",
    "unfortunately , pure neutrality transitions are likely to be rare among the adaptations that viruses undergo , and the data necessary to unambiguously identify them would be tedious if not impossible to obtain .",
    "our simulations provide evidence of selection for mutational robustness occurring in the form of increased neutrality of rna sequences for population sizes far below the size of the neutral network that the sequences inhabit .",
    "such increased neutrality was recently found in a study that compared evolved rna sequences to those deposited in an aptamer database  . for example , the comparison showed that human trna sequences were significantly more neutral , and hence more robust to mutations , than comparable random sequences that had not undergone evolutionary selection .",
    "however , we must caution that while in our simulations , selection for mutational robustness is the only force that can cause the sequences to become more mutationally robust , in real organisms other forces , for example selection for increased thermodynamic stability , could have similar effects .",
    "an experimental system that is quite similar to our simulations , probably more so than typical rna viruses , is that of _ viroids_unencapsidated rna sequences of only around @xmath41 bases  capable of infecting plant hosts .",
    "viroid evolution appears to be limited by the need to maintain certain secondary structural aspects  @xcite , which is consistent with our fitness assumptions .",
    "furthermore , in potato spindal tuber virus ( pstvd ) , a wide range of single and double mutants are observed to appear after a single passage  @xcite , suggesting that a quasispecies rapidly forms under natural conditions .",
    "viroids may have agricultural applications as they are capable of inducing ( desirable ) dwarfism in certain plant species  , and as such , a better understanding of their evolutionary processes may help to direct future research efforts .",
    "making the case for or against quasispecies dynamics in realistic , evolving populations of rna viruses , or even just self - replicating rna molecules , is not going to be easy .",
    "as the presence of an error threshold (; see also discussion in ) or the persistence of a consensus sequence ( this work ) have been ruled out as a diagnostic , we have to look for markers that are both unambiguous and easy to obtain .",
    "selection for robustness may eventually be observed in natural populations of adapting rna viruses or viroids , but up to now , no such signals have been reported .",
    "thus , while we can be confident that small population sizes do not preclude quasispecies dynamics in rna virus populations , on the basis of current experimental evidence , we can not decide whether quasispecies selection takes place in rna viruses .",
    "quasispecies effects are not confined to deterministic systems with infinite population size , but are readily observed in finite  even small  populations undergoing genetic drift .",
    "we find a continuous transition from very small populations , whose dynamics is dominated by drift , to larger populations , whose dynamics is dominated by quasispecies effects . the crucial parameter is the product of effective population size and genomic mutation rate , which needs to be significantly larger than one for quasispecies selection to operate .",
    "however , experimental evidence for these theoretical findings is currently not available , and will most likely be hard to obtain , because the differences in the dynamics of populations that are simply drifting and populations that are under quasispecies selection can be quite subtle .",
    "thus , a dedicated experimental effort is needed to demonstrate quasispecies selection in natural systems .",

    "if we take fitness @xmath46 of the @xmath47th offspring in our population as a random variable , the neutral fitness landscape implies that @xmath46 takes only values @xmath48 or @xmath49 , where @xmath50 occurs with probability @xmath42 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath46 is therefore a bernoulli distribution with probability of success @xmath42 , and we have @xmath51=\\pi$ ] and @xmath52=\\pi(1-\\pi).$ ]    we now consider the average fitness of the population in equilibrium , @xmath6 , defined as @xmath53 by the central limit theorem , the distribution of @xmath6 will approach a normal distribution @xmath54 $ ] as @xmath55 , and this limit will be reached well before @xmath12 ( typically @xmath56 is sufficient @xcite , and this condition is easily satisfied under all conditions studied ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : autocorr ] shows the autocorrelation function for the first equilibrium period shown in figure  [ fig : step ] ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the autocorrelation drops almost immediately to a mean of nearly zero , and has a noise level @xmath60 , consistent with the variation of @xmath3 over the time period in question .",
    "similar results hold for each period of fitness equilibrium shown in figure  [ fig : step ] .",
    "in contrast , the population s average neutrality showed significant autocorrelations . while we included the neutrality transitions in figure  [ fig : step ] for illustrative purposes",
    ", this lack of independence suggests that not all the neutrality steps identified are statistically significant .",
    "motivated by our observations , we seek to characterize the rapid transitions of the population from lower to higher neutrality states .",
    "we derive a statistical test for identifying such transitions _ a priori _ in time series data , and associating a @xmath21-value to measure the confidence level of such a transition occurring by chance .    consider a time series @xmath61 $ ] measured at @xmath62 sequential points in time . to test the hypothesis of equal means between two specified time periods @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] is straightforward , and we will assume equal variances for simplicity .",

    "thus , under the null hypothesis , the difference of observed means @xmath71 is normal with zero mean and known variance , and the associated @xmath21-value can be obtained by looking up the probability of @xmath77 exceeding its observed value in a cumulative distribution table .",
