    "<S> three - dimensional topological weyl semimetals can generally support a zero - dimensional weyl point characterized by a quantized chern number or a one - dimensional weyl nodal ring ( or line ) characterized by a quantized berry phase in the momentum space . here , </S>",

    "<S> such a weyl exceptional ring is characterized by both a quantized chern number and a quantized berry phase , which are defined via the riemann surface . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an experimental scheme to realize and measure the weyl exceptional ring in a dissipative cold atomic gas trapped in an optical lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , condensed matter systems have proven to be a powerful platform to study low energy gapless particles by using momentum space band structures to mimic the energy - momentum relation of relativistic particles  @xcite and beyond  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one celebrated example in three dimensions is the zero - dimensional weyl point  @xcite described by the weyl hamiltonian , which has been long sought - after in particle physics but only experimentally observed in condensed matter materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a weyl point can be viewed as a magnetic monopole  @xcite in the momentum space and possesses a quantized chern number on a surface enclosing the point . </S>",
    "<S> another example is the one - dimensional weyl nodal ring  @xcite , which has no counterpart in particle physics </S>",
    "<S> . it can be regarded as the generalization of zero - dimensional dirac cones in two - dimensional systems , such as in graphene , to three - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> such a nodal ring has a quantized berry phase over a closed path encircling it but does not possess a nonzero quantized chern number . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a natural question of whether there exists a topological ring exhibiting both a quantized chern number and a quantized berry phase in the momentum space .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , studies on those gapless states focus on closed and lossless systems . however , particle gain and loss are generally present in natural systems . </S>",
    "<S> such systems can often be described by non - hermitian hamiltonians  moiseyev2011 , berry2004 , rotter2009 , heiss2012 , which are widely applied to many different systems  @xcite . due to the non - hermiticity , eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are generically complex unless the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite is conserved and the imaginary part of energy is associated with either decay or growth . </S>",
    "<S> another intriguing feature of a non - hermitian system is the existence of exceptional points ( eps )  @xcite at which two eigenstates coalesce and the hamiltonian becomes defective , leading to many novel phenomena , such as loss - induced transparency  @xcite , single - mode lasers  khajavikhan2014science , zhang2014science , and reversed pump dependence of lasers  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate a system of weyl points in the presence of a spin - dependent non - hermitian term and find a weyl exceptional ring composed of eps . in stark contrast to a weyl nodal ring  @xcite , which does not have a nonzero chern number , remarkably , this ring exhibits a nonzero quantized chern number as long as the integral of the berry curvature is evaluated over a surface ( labeled by @xmath1 ) that encloses the whole ring . since energy is multi - valued in the complex parameter space due to its square root form , a state on the surface @xmath1 may be defined over the riemann surface , on which a function is single valued . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the chern number is zero when the surface @xmath1 does not enclose any part of the ring even when it is located inside it . </S>",
    "<S> besides the chern number , such a weyl exceptional ring has a quantized berry phase over a trajectory encircling the ring twice , instead of once in the case of the weyl nodal ring . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we propose a feasible scheme to engineer and probe the weyl exceptional ring in a dissipative ultracold atomic gas . in such a system , we find that the fermi arc can still exist but is suppressed , even though the weyl point transforms into a ring </S>",
    "<S> .        _ toy model of weyl exceptional ring_near a weyl point in the momentum space , a system can be described by the weyl hamiltonian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 represent pauli matrices and @xmath4 the chirality . for clarity , </S>",
    "<S> we consider the positive chirality and choose @xmath5 hereafter . in the presence of a non - hermitian term @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) associated with particle gain for spin up atoms and loss for spin down ones </S>",

    "<S> the eigenvalues are @xmath10 , where @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is defined via @xmath14 and @xmath15 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath13 is used to label two branches , given that @xmath16 gains a minus sign upon @xmath17 , corresponding to the other band . in the absence of @xmath18 , energy of both bands is real and two bands touch at @xmath19 with linear dispersion along all three momentum directions . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath13 takes only two nonequivalent discrete values : @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( corresponding to two distinct and separate bands ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7 , the eigenvalues become complex , and the single touching point morphs into a weyl exceptional ring in the @xmath22 plane characterized by @xmath23 . on this ring , </S>",
    "<S> both the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues vanish [ shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) ] and two eigenstates coalesce into a single one ( different from the case of degeneracy ) . fig .  [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) also illustrate that in the @xmath22 plane energy is purely real outside the ring ( with conserved @xmath0 symmetry ) and purely imaginary inside it for this simple model . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath13 takes continuous values from @xmath20 to @xmath24 ( @xmath13 and @xmath25 are equivalent ) and gains @xmath21 when a state travels through the ring and returns , ending up at another state with opposite energy , arising from the role of branch points that the weyl exceptional ring plays .    in complex analysis , besides using branch cuts , an alternative visual representation to depict a multi - valued function is the riemann surface , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) manifold that wraps around the complex plane infinite ( noncompact ) or finite ( compact ) number of times . </S>",
    "<S> before we discuss the topology of the weyl exceptional ring , let us first focus on the definition of a closed 2d surface @xmath1 via the riemann surface . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> fig1(c ) and ( d ) , we plot the riemann surface of @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( the color represents the strength of @xmath28 ) , showing that energy is single - valued on the surface , which connects the different bands . given the single value property , we define each state on @xmath1 to be living on the riemann surface . for example , if we consider a state at @xmath29 with @xmath30 , any other states on the surface @xmath1 can be obtained by starting from this state and travelling on the momentum space surface @xmath1 while keeping @xmath31 on the riemann surface .    with the proper definition of a closed 2d surface </S>",
    "<S> , we can characterize the topology of a weyl exceptional ring by the chern number on the surface based on two approaches : the integral of spin vector fields and the berry curvature . for the former , </S>",
    "<S> the chern number is given by  @xcite @xmath32 which characterizes the number of times that the spin field @xmath33 wraps around a closed surface @xmath1 parametrized by ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath36 denotes the unit vector along the @xmath37 direction and @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the normalized right eigenstate of @xmath40 [ i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> direct calculations show that @xmath43 when the surface @xmath1 encloses the whole ring as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , while @xmath44 when it does not enclose any part of the ring [ shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> analogous to the scenario without decay  @xcite , we may also define the first chern number via the berry curvature @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the berry curvature . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that @xmath47 when the surface @xmath1 encloses the weyl exceptional ring and @xmath48 otherwise , suggesting that the topological charge is entirely carried by the ring .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical meaning of the berry curvature in this system can be understood from the following semiclassical equation under an external gradient force @xmath49 ( see the supplemental material for derivation ) @xmath50 where @xmath51+\\bar{\\mathbf{a}}_\\theta(\\mathbf{k}_{c } ) \\cdot { \\dot { \\mathbf{k}}}_{c}$ ] , @xmath52 $ ] with the berry connection being @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the normalized left eigenstate of @xmath56 [ i.e. , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the center coordinate of a wave packet in the real space and momentum space , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the berry curvature plays the same role as in the traditional semiclassical equation in a closed system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this open system , the equation includes a term that effectively modifies the energy spectra , resulting from the difference between left and right eigenstates , a feature in a non - hermitian hamiltonian . without @xmath49 , </S>",
    "<S> the group velocity is dictated by the real part of the spectra , which implies that inside the weyl exceptional ring in the @xmath61 plane , the group velocity vanishes .    </S>",
    "<S> other than the chern number on the surface , there also exists a quantized berry phase characterizing the weyl exceptional ring , defined as @xmath62 where the path @xmath63 travels across the ring twice along the riemann surface so that the state returns to the original one after the entire trajectory as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) and ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> direct calculations yield @xmath64 , consistent with the result for a single ep  @xcite . </S>",
