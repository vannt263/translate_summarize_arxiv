    "the experiments with seeding the @xmath5-recurrence with @xmath29 generations of @xmath22-numbers ( see the end of section 2 ) could be a first step towards a better understanding of this relation .    whenever one observes the phenomenon of universality in a _ model _",
    ", one is tempted to look for realizations of the same universality class in _ nature_. it is an interesting question whether recurrences of the type studied in this article represent real physical processes or might be of use in the study of some dynamical system occuring in real life .",
