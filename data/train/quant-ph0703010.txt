    "numerical results show ( fig .",
    "[ h - osc ] ) that entanglement oscillates with the two  site period .",
    "the qualitative explanation of the numerical results is the following .",
    "qubits 1 and",
    "n are situated at the chain ends . since entanglement is non  zero only between the nearest  neighbors , the pair of qubits 1 and 2 and the pair of qubits n-1 and n have the maximal pairwise entanglement for the homogeneous chain .",
    "spin 2 can be entangled both with spin 1 and with spin 3 . since spin 2",
    "is strongly entangled with spin 1 , the entanglement of spins 2 and 3 is weaker . as a result ,",
    "spin 3 is strongly entangled with spin 4 , etc .",
    "this explains the oscillator behavior of the concurrence displayed in fig .",

    "in fact we have here the dimerised spin chain which can be considered qualitatively as a set of non  interacting spin pairs at @xmath132 the dependence of the concurrence on the ratio of the ssi is shown in fig .  [ ratio ] .",
    "it is worth to notice that it is impossible to observe the influence of ends of the chain on the entanglement already at @xmath133 .    in figs .",
    "[ 1 - 2lt ]    [ 2 - 3lt ] the dependence of the concurrences @xmath134 and @xmath135 on the length of the homogeneous chain consisting of an odd ( even ) number of spins is displayed .",
    "the concurrence @xmath134 decreases at even n and increases at odd",
    "n when n increases .",
    "for the concurrence @xmath135 the situation is opposite . in order to explain these results",
    "it is necessary to take into account the influence of the ends of the chain on the entangled states .     and for @xmath128.,width=325 ]    as a result , we obtain that the ends of the chain yield opposite contributions to the entanglement for the chain of an odd number of spins . for example , one can easily find in a chain consisting of 5 spins that spin 5 leads to a decrease of the entanglement of spins 1 and 2 .",
    "this effect is diminished when the odd number of spins increases and then the entanglement of spins 1 and 2 increases . on the contrary ,",
    "the second end of the chain increases the entanglement of spins 1 and 2 at an even number of spins .",
    "this leads to the calculated decrease of the concurrence ( see fig .  [ 1 - 2lt ] ) when the even number of spins increases .",
    "analogously , it is possible to explain the growth ( fall ) of the concurrence of the entanglement of spins 2 and 3 in the dependence on the length of the chain consisting of an even ( odd ) number of spins  ( see fig .  [ 2 - 3lt ] ) .",

    "[ 2 - 3lt ] have a simple qualitative explanation .",
    "the growth of the concurrence up to its maximal value is determined by the decrease of the partial suppression of the ssi due to the flip  flop transitions at low temperatures .",
    "the state of spins 2 and 3 approaches to a separable one at low temperatures when the spins are trying to orient parallel to the local fields .",
    "entanglement of such a state decreases when the temperature decreases .",

    "in the present work we investigate entanglement in alternating open chains .",
    "the developed methods of the diagonalization of the xy - hamiltonian of open alternating spin chains allow us to study the pairwise entanglement for different parameters of the chain and its temperature .",
    "similar methods can be applied for an investigation of the pairwise entanglement in open chains with periodic coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "methods of exact diagonalization of the xy - hamiltonian in such chains  @xcite allow a solution of different problems of quantum information theory for models of quantum registers taking into account the qubit addressing .",
    "however , the qubit addressing requires a large difference of the larmor frequencies of different spins in comparison with their ssi coupling constants .",
