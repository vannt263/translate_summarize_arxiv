    "the acceleration of high - energy particles is an important problem in astrophysics .",
    "this paper examines one acceleration mechanism , `` surfing acceleration , '' as it applies to relativistic particles at perpendicular shocks .",
    "an illustration of an ion undergoing surfing acceleration at a perpendicular shock is given in figure  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "in this picture an ion of velocity  @xmath3 arrives just upstream of the shock with small @xmath4 and is reflected by the jump in the electrostatic potential  @xmath5 at the shock , which is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : f2 ] .",
    "the lorentz force then causes the ion to return to the shock where it is again reflected and brought back to the shock front by the lorentz force .",
    "this process continues , confining the particle to the vicinity of the shock , where it is accelerated in the  @xmath6 direction by the motional electric field ,  @xmath7 , where  @xmath8 is the plasma velocity .",
    "if one thinks of  @xmath9 in figure  [ fig : f2 ] as analogous to the profile of an ocean wave , the accelerating ion in figure  [ fig : f1 ] is analogous to a surfer . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on ions .",
    "however , shock surfing acceleration is believed to be important for electrons as well ( mcclements et  al 2001 , hoshino & shimada 2002 ) , and it is trivial to modify the analysis of sections  [ sec : analytic ] and  [ sec : num ] to treat the electron case .",
    "an ion s @xmath10-oscillations in front of the shock can be approximately described in terms of an effective potential energy ( lee et  al 1996 , ucer & shapiro 2001 ) , which can be derived as follows .",
    "we start with the @xmath10-component of the equation of motion , @xmath11 where  @xmath12 is the relativistic lorentz factor , and we work in shock wave frame .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 with  @xmath14 a function of  @xmath10 alone , that  @xmath15 , that  latexmath:[$|v_x| \\ll    scale that is much shorter than the time required for  @xmath12 or  @xmath17 to change appreciably .",
    "we also treat  @xmath18 as spatially uniform .",
    "we then multiply equation  ( [ eq : dpxdt ] ) by  @xmath19 and integrate in time , treating  @xmath12 and  @xmath17 as constant , to obtain @xmath20 where @xmath21 , \\label{eq : ueffdef0}\\ ] ] @xmath22 is the energy of @xmath10-oscillations , and @xmath23 is the value of  @xmath24 at its local minimum at  @xmath25 .",
    "we define @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the value of @xmath28 at its local maximum .",
    "surfing ions , which are trapped in the effective potential well , have  @xmath29 .",
    "the effective potential energy is plotted in figure  [ fig : f2 ] for  @xmath30 .",
    "the turning points of an ion of given  @xmath22 , obtained by solving equation  ( [ eq : xenergy ] ) with  @xmath31 , are denoted  @xmath32 and @xmath33 . over many bounces ,",
    "@xmath12 and  @xmath17 vary slowly , causing  @xmath22 to change in a way that can be calculated by noting that the adiabatic invariant @xmath34 is approximately conserved ( ucer & shapiro 2001 ) .",
    "surfing can only occur if there is a local minimum in  @xmath24 , which requires that @xmath35 over some interval of  @xmath10 [ see , e.g. , sagdeev & shapiro ( 1973 ) , katsouleas & dawson ( 1983 ) , ucer & shapiro ( 2001 ) ] . in order for particles with  @xmath36 to surf",
    ", @xmath37 must locally exceed  @xmath18 , a condition that may arise at large alfvnic mach number ( hoshino & shimada 2002 ) .",
    "the escape of a surfing particle from the effective potential well determines how far the particle can travel along the @xmath6 direction , which in turn determines the amount of energy the particle gains .",
    "several escape mechanisms have been considered in the literature .",
    "first , if the maximum value of  @xmath38 , denoted @xmath39 , is less than @xmath18 ( assumed constant ) and a surfing particle s @xmath40 increases to the point that @xmath41 , then the local minimum of  @xmath24 disappears and the particle escapes downstream ( sagdeev & shapiro 1973 ) .",
    "second , as a non - relativistic particle s  @xmath40 increases , the slope of  @xmath24 at large  @xmath10 increases as illustrated in figure  [ fig : f2 ] , causing the width  @xmath42 of a particle s bounce oscillations to decrease . since @xmath43 is approximately conserved , where  @xmath44 is a typical value of  @xmath45 , decreasing  @xmath42 increases  @xmath44 , thereby increasing  @xmath22  ( ucer & shapiro 2001 ) . if  @xmath22 increases above  @xmath46 , then the particle escapes downstream ( lee et  al 1996 , ucer & shapiro 2001 ) .",
    "third , in an oblique shock the velocity vector of a surfing particle gradually rotates in the  @xmath47-plane due to the lorentz force associated with  @xmath48 , as depicted in figure  [ fig : f3 ] , which is an adaptation of figure  4 of lee et  al ( 1996 ) .",
    "as this happens , @xmath40 is eventually reduced to zero and the particle escapes upstream since the  @xmath49 component of the lorentz force ceases to turn the particle back towards the shock ( lee et  al 1996 ) .",
    "fourth , wave - particle interactions can reduce a surfing particle s  @xmath40 to zero , again allowing the particle to escape upstream ( shapiro , lee , & quest 2001 ) .",
    "fifth , as noted by lee , shapiro , & sagdeev ( 1996 ) and hoshino & shimada ( 2002 ) , some shocks are intrinsically nonstationary and can periodically `` break , '' allowing surfing particles to escape downstream .    for perpendicular shocks and relativistic particles with  @xmath36 , the first three mechanisms described above are absent .",
    "this has led previous authors to consider scenarios of `` unlimited acceleration '' when @xmath50 over some interval in  @xmath10 ( katsouleas & dawson 1983 , ucer & shapiro 2001 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that shock surfing of relativistic particles at perpendicular shocks leads to a power - law energy spectrum of accelerated particles , provided fluctuations in the shock electric and magnetic fields are not too large , and to calculate the power - law index of this spectrum .",
    "we ignore diffusion in a particle s @xmath51-momentum , @xmath52 , and assume that changes in  @xmath52 are dominated by the motional electric field .",
    "however , we take into account moderate fluctuations in the electric and magnetic fields in the shock s vicinity , and in particular the effects of these fluctuations on the  @xmath10 component of a particle s momentum ,  @xmath53 .",
    "an ion propagating primarily in the  @xmath6 direction encounters a series of random forces in the @xmath10 direction ( denoted  @xmath54 ) due to fluctuations in  @xmath38 and @xmath18 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : f4 ] .",
    "these forces induce a series of random increments in  @xmath53 , causing diffusion in  @xmath53 .",
    "for example , suppose the typical electric and/or magnetic field structures have a length  @xmath55 along the  @xmath51 direction and a typical amplitude  @xmath56 , that an ion moves primarily in the  @xmath57 direction at a speed  @xmath58 , and that these structures fluctuate on a time scale that is longer than the time @xmath59 for a surfing particle to traverse one of the structures .",
    "the random increment in  @xmath53 when an ion moves through one structure then has a magnitude @xmath60 if the field structures are space filling , the ion undergoes one such momentum kick during each time  @xmath61 , leading to a coefficient of diffusion in  @xmath53 , @xmath62 that is independent of particle energy .",
    "the energy spectrum of accelerated particles can be understood in terms of two competing effects .",
    "on the one hand , diffusion in  @xmath53 stochastically de - traps particles by increasing  @xmath22 above  @xmath46 , thereby allowing particles to escape downstream . on the other hand ,",
    "the gradual increase in  @xmath12 due to acceleration by  @xmath63 focuses a surfing particle with  @xmath36 into the bottom of the effective potential well , as follows from conservation of  @xmath64 ( ucer & shapiro 2001 ) .",
    "this combination of factors leads to a power - law energy spectrum of accelerated particles , @xmath65 .",
    "the value of  @xmath2 depends upon @xmath66 where  @xmath67 is the time to double a surfing particle s energy and  @xmath68 is the momentum diffusion time scale . as  @xmath69",
    "is decreased , the acceleration time is reduced relative to the momentum diffusion time scale , particles experience larger energy increases before escaping the surfing mechanism , and one expects the energy spectrum  @xmath70 to become harder .",
    "this expectation is born out by the calculations and simulations to be presented in sections  [ sec : analytic ] and  [ sec : num ] , which show that in the strong - scattering limit ( @xmath71 ) @xmath72 , in the moderate - scattering limit ( @xmath73 ) @xmath74 , and in the weak - scattering limit ( @xmath75 )  @xmath76 .",
    "if , contrary to what we assume , the field fluctuations were so large that the minimum of the effective potential energy disappeared at locations separated by a typical distance  @xmath77 along a surfing particle s trajectory , one would not obtain a simple power - law energy spectrum ; the spectrum would instead steepen above an energy  @xmath78 corresponding to the energy a particle gains by surfing a distance  @xmath77 ( hoshino & shimada 2002 ) .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "if a particle is assumed to undergo diffusion in  @xmath52 with diffusion coefficient  @xmath79 as well as `` advection '' in  @xmath52 due to  @xmath63 , then a particle can in principle diffuse to  @xmath80 and escape into the upstream region .",
    "the condition under which this escape mechanism can be neglected can be understood by considering an analogy to first - order fermi acceleration at a non - relativistic shock , as follows .",
    "suppose a particle is a distance  @xmath10 downstream of a shock , that the downstream fluid velocity is  @xmath81 , and that the particle diffuses in space with diffusion coefficient  @xmath82 .",
    "the time for a particle to return to the shock in the absence of advection is  @xmath83 , and the time for the particle s distance from the shock to be doubled by advection in the absence of diffusion is  @xmath84 .",
    "the probability that the particle returns to the shock is  @xmath85 ( see , e.g. , bicout 1997 ) .",
    "this advection - diffusion problem is analogous to the advection and diffusion in  @xmath52 that would occur in shock surfing with nonzero  @xmath79 .",
    "the probability that a particle escapes the surfing mechanism by diffusing in momentum space to  @xmath80 is again @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the time to diffuse to  @xmath80 in the absence of advection in  @xmath52 , and  @xmath88 is the time for a particle s @xmath51-momentum to double due to  @xmath63 .",
    "escape through  @xmath52 diffusion is thus negligible provided  @xmath89 , or latexmath:[$d_{p_y } \\ll p_y^2",
    "q     we note that it is not clear how efficiently particles are injected into the surfing acceleration mechanism .",
    "injection appears to be natural for pickup ions accelerated by the heliospheric termination shock . in the frame of the solar wind ,",
    "pickup ions are born with particle speeds comparable to the solar - wind velocity , and thus pickup ions that arrive at the heliospheric termination shock at the right point in their gyromotion have very small @xmath4 , which allows them to be trapped in front of the shock ( lee et  al 1996 , zank et  al 1996 , lever et  al 2001 ) .",
    "surfing acceleration in other cases , however , may be more difficult to initiate",
    ". it may be that particles can be injected at the time that a shock is formed if the shock originates from an explosive event .",
    "it is also possible that turbulent conditions in the shock transition region can feed particles into the surfing mechanism .",
    "hoshino & shimada ( 2002 ) have found electron surfing in pic simulations of perpendicular shocks , demonstrating that injection does occur , at least for electrons . additional work on injection , however , is needed .",
    "although our analysis is restricted to the case of perpendicular shocks , some of the results may apply to the more general case of superluminal shocks , for which the point of intersection between a field line and the shock plane moves faster than  @xmath91 . for such shocks",
    ", there exists a `` perpendicular shock frame '' in which the shock is stationary and the upstream electric and magnetic fields lie in the shock plane ( begelman & kirk 1990 ) .",
    "there are , however , two issues that would have to be addressed before our results could be generalized to this case . first , the condition for @xmath38 to exceed  @xmath18 in more general superluminal shocks must be found .",
    "second , in general the upstream flow velocity in the perpendicular shock frame has a component along the upstream magnetic field .",
    "if particles start to surf with a significant  @xmath92 velocity , they would only approach the state that we analyze with  @xmath93 after significant acceleration in the  @xmath6 direction . as a particle approaches this state ,",
    "@xmath40 gradually increases , and the effects of such a gradual increase are not included in our analysis .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "analytic ] we show analytically that surfing ions that diffuse in  @xmath53 are described by a power - law energy spectrum .",
    "we calculate analytically the power - law index for the case of weak momentum diffusion ( @xmath75 ) , and derive a rough estimate for the power - law index in the case of strong momentum diffusion ( @xmath71 ) . in section  [ sec : num ] we present monte carlo numerical calculations of surfing in the presence of diffusion in  @xmath53 for the weak , moderate , and strong momentum - diffusion cases .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we begin with the relativistic vlasov equation with a term added to model diffusion in  @xmath53 , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is taken to be independent of particle energy as in equation  ( [ eq : dpxest ] ) .",
    "we consider a perpendicular shock and ignore spatial variations in the magnetic field and motional electric field : @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 we also take @xmath99 @xmath100 and @xmath101 we confine our analysis to relativistic surfing ions , for which we assume @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 equation  ( [ eq : vl1 ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath108    we now change variables , defining @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath112 or , equivalently , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the effective potential energy for the particle s motion in  @xmath10 illustrated in figure  [ fig : f2 ] , @xmath22 is the energy associated with this motion , and @xmath23 is the value of  @xmath24 at its local minimum at  @xmath25 . as discussed in the introduction , surfing particles satisfy @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath27 is the value of @xmath24 at its local maximum . in terms of @xmath117 , equation  ( [ eq : vl2 ] ) becomes @xmath118 where @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) is the distribution function for particles with  @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "we assume that the time  @xmath123 for a particle to bounce in the effective potential well is much shorter than the acceleration time or the time for a particle to escape from the potential well due to diffusion in  @xmath53 .",
    "we thus take @xmath124 and @xmath125 with @xmath126 we then set @xmath127 and expand equation  ( [ eq : vl3 ] ) in powers of  @xmath128 . upon collecting all terms of order  @xmath129 (",
    "there is only one ) and dividing by  @xmath4 , we find that @xmath130 as in the introduction , we take @xmath32 and @xmath33 to be the bounce points of a particle of `` energy ''  @xmath22 , with @xmath131 . since @xmath132 and @xmath133 give the distribution function at the same point in phase space , one has @xmath134 .",
    "similarly , @xmath135 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : eps0 ] ) thus implies that @xmath136 upon collecting all terms in equation  ( [ eq : vl3 ] ) of order  @xmath137 and dividing by  @xmath4 , we find that @xmath138 we integrate equation  ( [ eq : eps1 ] ) from  @xmath32 to @xmath33 for @xmath119 , then integrate equation  ( [ eq : eps1 ] ) from @xmath32 to @xmath33 for @xmath120 , and then add the two resulting equations to annihilate the terms involving  @xmath139 , thereby obtaining @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142    we note the behavior of  @xmath143 near  @xmath144 for future reference .",

    "we find @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the flux of particles in  @xmath22-space .",
    "the quantity in the first set of parentheses on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : defgamma ] ) is  @xmath161 , while the coefficient of  @xmath162 within the second set of parentheses is  @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the change in  @xmath22 during a small time interval  @xmath165 , and the angle brackets denote an average over the stochastic scattering that gives rise to diffusion in  @xmath53 .",
    "the term  @xmath166 is the rate of change of  @xmath22 caused by the approximate conservation of the adiabatic invariant @xmath167 that is , setting @xmath168 yields @xmath169 , which confirms the statement made in the introduction that @xmath64-conservation drives a relativistic surfing particle towards the bottom of the effective potential well ( ucer & shapiro 2001 ) . the terms on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : defgamma ] ) proportional to  @xmath95 give the advection and diffusion in  @xmath22-space arising from a time average of a particle s diffusion in  @xmath53 .",
    "if diffusion in  @xmath53 causes a particle s  @xmath22 to increase to  @xmath46 , the particle escapes downstream .",
    "we thus seek a solution to equation  ( [ eq : fp1 ] ) subject to the boundary condition @xmath170 we also require that  @xmath162 be finite and differentiable at  @xmath171 . since there are no @xmath153 derivatives in equation  ( [ eq : fp1 ] ) , we can treat particles with different values of  @xmath153 independently .",
    "we will henceforth focus on particles with a single value of  @xmath153 , and assume that a large number of such particles are injected into the surfing mechanism at  @xmath172 .",
    "we rewrite equation  ( [ eq : valgam2 ] ) , dropping the prime on  @xmath173 , to obtain @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the time required to double the particle s initial @xmath51-momentum .",
    "because a surfing particle s energy increases linearly in time , the number of particles that are accelerated to a final lorentz factor in the interval  @xmath176 , denoted  @xmath177 , is equal to the number of particles that escape the effective potential well in the time interval  @xmath178 , where @xmath179 and @xmath180 from equation  ( [ eq : gam1 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath181    using equation  ( [ eq : gam1 ] ) , we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq : fp1 ] ) as @xmath182 + \\frac{\\partial ^2}{\\partial u^2 } \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha u p}{2h}\\right ) \\equiv{\\cal l}(p ) \\label{eq : fp2}\\ ] ] where @xmath183 and @xmath184 the eigenvalue equation @xmath185 can be written in sturm - liouville form .",

    "we follow a set of test particles ( ions ) with  @xmath260 that obey the equations of motion @xmath261 and @xmath262 where @xmath263 is a stochastic function of time that increments  @xmath53 by  @xmath264 ( equal chance for  + or  - ) during each time step  @xmath61 , where  @xmath265 and @xmath95 is a constant .",
    "we work in the shock wave frame , with @xmath13 , where @xmath266 we set @xmath267 , where @xmath268 , @xmath269 , and @xmath270 are the shock speed , the lorentz factor for the shock speed , and the upstream magnetic field in the laboratory frame , respectively .",
    "although @xmath18 is in general not constant , we assume a constant value , @xmath271 .",
    "we set  @xmath272 , @xmath273 , and @xmath274 .",
    "the minimum of the approximate effective potential @xmath275 occurs at  @xmath276 .",
    "we start the particles at  @xmath277 , with  @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and  @xmath280 . by varying  @xmath95 ,",
    "we are able to consider different values of  @xmath69 in equation  ( [ eq : defalpha ] ) .    to improve the statistics , we implement particle splitting as follows .",
    "we start each simulation with  1000 particles . at each time step , we update @xmath281 and @xmath282 for each particle . when a particle escapes from the effective potential well the calculation for that particle is stopped and @xmath12 at that time is recorded .",
    "when half of the original particles have escaped , each of the remaining particles is `` split''that is , a copy of each particle is created with the same position and momentum , and both the original and the copy are subsequently tracked .",
    "when we calculate the energy spectrum , the weightings of split particles are halved .",
    "the splitting process is repeated each time that the particle number drops to  500 until the end of the simulation , when every particle s @xmath12 exceeds a threshold value ,  @xmath283 .    in the weak scattering case ,",
    "@xmath284 , a difficulty for calculating the spectrum is that almost all of the particles reach the threshold  @xmath285 before escaping .",
    "we therefore use another method to obtain the spectrum when  @xmath284 .",
    "we assume that the spectrum is given by a power law , @xmath286 with  @xmath287 .",
    "the number of particles with  @xmath12 between @xmath288 and @xmath289 is given by @xmath290 where @xmath291 is a constant .",
    "the number of particles with  @xmath292 is @xmath293 from eqs .",
    "( [ nu1 ] ) and ( [ nu2 ] ) , we obtain the spectral index @xmath2 as @xmath294 we take @xmath295 and @xmath296 and track 5000 particles for each value of  @xmath69 .",
    "our numerical results for  @xmath297 are plotted in figure  [ fig : f5 ] along with our analytic result [ equation  ( [ eq : bweak ] ) ] for the same shock parameters .",

    "our numerical results for @xmath298 are plotted in figure  [ fig : f6 ] , and are consistent with equation  ( [ eq : bstrong ] ) when  @xmath71 .",
    "in this paper we model surfing acceleration of relativistic particles at perpendicular shocks as a process in which particles undergo diffusion in  @xmath53 ( @xmath10 being the direction of the shock normal ) while propagating in steady - state electric and magnetic field profiles . for shocks with  @xmath50 over some interval in  @xmath10 ,",
    "where  @xmath92 is the direction of the magnetic field , and for relativistic ions propagating primarily in the @xmath57 direction , surfing produces a power - law energy spectrum of accelerated particles , provided the momentum diffusion coefficient  @xmath95 is independent of energy .",
    "we have calculated analytically the power - law index for the case of weak momentum diffusion , given in equation  ( [ eq : bweak ] ) , and have carried out monte carlo test - particle calculations to determine the power - law index for the weak , moderate , and strong momentum diffusion cases ( section  [ sec : num ] ) .",
