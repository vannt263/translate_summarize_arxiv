    "a modification of rack cohomology theory led to quandle cohomology theory which was developed in @xcite in order to define invariants of classical knots and knotted surfaces in state - sum form , called quandle cocycle ( knot ) invariants .",
    "these invariants can be understood as enhancements of the quandle counting invariant , where quandle colorings of a link diagram are counted with a weight determined by a quandle cocycle .    in @xcite ,",
    "the quandle homology theory was generalized to the case when the coefficient groups admit the structure of alexander quandles , by including an action of the infinite cyclic group in the boundary operator . using generalizations of quandle homology theory provided by andruskiewitsch and graa @xcite ,",

    ", we prove that the degenerate chains form a sub - complex of the classical complex defining rack homology and define a homology theory analogous to quandle homology for non - quandle racks which reduces to the usual quandle homology when the rack is a quandle . in section 4",
    "we use cocycles in @xmath10 to enhance the rack counting invariant , obtaining a family of link invariants which generalize the cjkls invariants to allow non - quandle racks . note",
