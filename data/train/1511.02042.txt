    "the collapse transition of a polymer chain in dilute solution is one of the most classical topics in polymer physics  @xcite .",
    "such a phenomenon arises from a competition between excluded volume and some kind of attractive interaction of the monomers with one another .",
    "depending on which of the two effects prevails , the polymer takes on a swollen state ( coil ) or a compact one ( globule ) , also denoted as good- or bad - solvent regimes , respectively .",
    "the two regimes are separated by a phase transition ( driven by temperature , or by some actual change in the solvent quality ) , which is characterized by specific properties of the polymer , usually denoted as the _ theta _ state .",
    "different lattice models have been proposed to investigate these phenomena . in the standard _ interacting self - avoiding walk _ ( isaw ) model  @xcite , polymers are forbidden from visiting a lattice site more than once , and a contact interaction is assigned to nearest - neighbor sites visited by nonconsecutive monomers .",
    "alternative models are the _ interacting self - avoiding trail _ ( isat )  @xcite and the _ vertex - interacting self - avoiding walk _ ( visaw )  @xcite , both characterized by the fact that only lattice bonds ( not sites ) are subject to the single - visit constraint .",
    "the two models differ in the fact that the isat is allowed to cross itself , whilst the visaw is not . in both cases ,",
    "the self - attractive interaction is associated with the multiply - visited sites .    according to the paradigm of universality",
    ", one would expect that the critical behavior of all three of the above models should be described by the same universality class .",
    "indeed , this seems to be the case in the good - solvent regime ( which is itself a critical state ) , but there are several evidences that , in two dimensions , the theta state belongs to three different universality classes and , for the isat and visaw cases , it is also associated to the onset of a peculiar _ maximally - dense _",
    "phase  @xcite and other more subtle features  @xcite .",
    "note that two - dimensional models have attracted great theoretical interest , due to the availability of rigorous results coming from exact solutions and/or conformal field theories , through the analogy with `` magnetic '' @xmath0 models in the limit @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the isaw theta point has been clearly identified as a tricritical point in the language of @xmath0 models , and all of its properties are quite well - established , with good agreement between theory  @xcite and simulations  @xcite for the values of critical exponents .",
    "conversely , a number of contradictory results have emerged for the isat and visaw theta points , in particular some striking discrepancies among monte carlo simulations  @xcite , numerical transfer - matrix methods  @xcite , field - theoretic arguments  @xcite , and exact results  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we study a generalized polymer model that incorporates all the aforementioned ones , in the framework of husimi  @xcite and bethe lattices  @xcite .",
    "the free parameters characterizing such lattices ( building blocks , coordination numbers ) are chosen , according to experience , in order to obtain the best possible approximation to a regular 2d square lattice model .",
    "the motivation for this work stems from the difficulty of extracting , from the existing literature , a unified view of the phase diagram in the presence of the different topological constraints and competing collapse interactions described above .",
    "indeed , considerable work has been done in this direction in particular by bedini , owczarek , and prellberg ( making use of refined monte carlo simulations )  @xcite and by foster and pinettes ( mainly by means of numerical transfer - matrix techniques )  @xcite , but several unresolved issues and contradictory results still remains .",
    "just to give a couple of examples , the mentioned authors have investigated an _ asymmetric _",
    "isat ( denoted as aisat ) on the square lattice , where doubly - visited sites with or without crossing are assigned a different attractive interaction .",
    "now , in the special case of crossing interactions only , the transfer - matrix results  @xcite suggest the onset of a first - order collapse , while the simulations  @xcite seem to predict a revival of the isaw theta state , i.e. , a weak continuous transition , with no evidence of a maximally - dense phase .",
    "moreover , whilst an exact solution  @xcite of the visaw model predicts a correlation - length exponent @xmath2 , monte carlo simulations  @xcite suggest the isaw value @xmath3 , and transfer - matrix methods  @xcite are incompatible with both results .    in this context , a clear advantage of the approach developed in the current article is the possibility of a sharp determination of the phase diagram ( with extremely high numerical precision in the case of the husimi lattice , even analytical in the case of the bethe lattice ) .",
    "for instance , we have no ambiguity on the order of the transitions , which is usually not the case with methods affected by higher numerical uncertainties . on the other hand",
    ", a primary drawback of the matter is that the resulting phase diagram , indeed exact on such infinite - dimensional treelike lattices , is not guaranteed to correspond to the actual phase diagram of the 2d model . concerning this point",
    ", we have nonetheless to say that husimi and bethe lattice models often turn out to exhibit a remarkably good qualitative agreement with finite - dimension results , when the latter are well - established by other methods .",
    "this has been observed in different polymer models , such as the semiflexible isaw  @xcite or the bond - isaw  @xcite , and holds true , as we shall see , at least in a limiting case of the model under investigation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we shall see that the bethe lattice model yields a slightly less convincing behavior for the general case , but we have found it interesting ( and therefore we have included it in the article ) , mostly by virtue of the opportunity of a fully analytical solution .",
    "a more substantial difficulty of our approach is that , even though the husimi or bethe solutions take into account certain local correlations , they still have a mean - field nature , so that _ in principle _ they can not predict critical exponents . as a consequence ,",
    "the universal points are to be naively identified on the basis of physical intuition , and/or according to their role in the phase diagram . in conclusion , we can not expect that our results provide definitive answers to the open problems of the 2d case , in particular to the issue of universality classes , but we believe they might be nonetheless of some use , mainly as a coherent set of hypotheses , yet to be tested by more specific methods .",

    "let us define the model on the regular two - dimensional square lattice , as in the original ( partial ) versions .",
    "the definition for the husimi or bethe lattices follows in a straightforward way .",
    "the polymer is represented as a _ self - avoiding trail _ , that is , a walk such that lattice bonds can be visited only once , whereas lattice sites can be visited more than once ( at most twice on the square lattice ) .",

    "[ fig : husimilattice ] , where it is understood that the size of the tree is arbitrarily increased ( toward a thermodynamic limit ) by a self - replicating growth procedure . in a wide part of the literature ,",
    "a _ husimi lattice _ is defined as the `` inner region '' of a corresponding infinite husimi tree  @xcite , meaning a region where a homogeneity condition holds for thermal averages of local observables ( for instance , the site magnetization for the ferromagnetic ising model ) .",
    "such thermal averages can thus be determined by the fixed points of relatively simple self - consistency equations .",
    "unfortunately , due to the fact that in a husimi tree the majority of sites is located on the boundary , it turns out that in certain cases boundary conditions heavily affect the properties of the inner region as well , which is not a good fact to the purpose of approximating the thermodynamic behavior of a regular lattice model . for a discussion of these issues , see for instance refs .  .",
    "the husimi lattice is therefore better defined  @xcite as an ensemble of random - regular hyper - graphs , that are , roughly speaking , random graphs made up of a unique type of hyper - edge ( for instance , a square cluster as in fig .  [ fig : husimilattice ] ) , with a fixed coordination number .",
    "this kind of systems have no boundary , so that the problem of boundary conditions is avoided , and are _ locally treelike _ , since the length of closed paths diverges as the logarithm of the number of sites in the thermodynamic limit ( excluding of course short paths that are closed within single clusters ) .",
    "the latter fact means that a husimi lattice still looks ( locally ) like fig .",
    "[ fig : husimilattice ] and , more importantly , that its thermodynamic properties can still be derived in terms of simple self - consistency equations .",
    "of course , our choice to use square clusters as building blocks , and a coordination number @xmath18 ( in this context , we define the coordination number as the number of building blocks attached to each given site ) is motivated by the purpose of approximating the model on the ordinary 2d square lattice .",
    "the self - consistency equations ( a.k.a . _ recursion equations _ ) can be worked out in different ways .",
    "a possible way , which we believe likely to be the simplest one , is to derive them as stationarity conditions for a suitable variational free energy density .",
    "let us consider the grand - canonical free - energy density per site ( in @xmath19 units ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the number of sites .",
    "for the husimi lattice defined above , this free - energy density can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the _ cluster partition function _ , @xmath24 is the _ single - site partition function _ , and @xmath25 is the ratio between the number of square clusters and the number of sites present in the system . roughly speaking",
    ", the single - site term may be regarded as a correction over the cluster term , due to the overlap between clusters .",
    "the cluster partition function @xmath23 is the partition function of a small subsystem made up of four sites on a square cluster , interacting with one another and with effective fields that represent the remainder of the system .",
    "it will therefore take the following form @xmath26 where @xmath27 are labels for the polymer configurations on each site , @xmath28 is the statistical weight of interactions inside the square cluster ( including topological constraints ) , and @xmath29 are the effective fields . note that these fields are sometimes called _ cavity fields _ , since they represent the probabilities of site configurations for a system in which a cluster interaction is removed ( that is , replaced by a cavity ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 can be regarded as the _ free - energy shift _ between the system with a cavity and the unperturbed system . for clarity ,",
    "let us note that , in most papers dealing with polymer models on husimi or bethe lattices , the cavity fields are called _ partial partition functions_. in equation  ( [ eq : cluster_partition_function ] ) the treelike nature of the system is reflected in the fact that , in the absence of the cluster interaction , the joint probability distribution factorizes , meaning that the site configurations are statistically independent . indeed , in a real tree - graph the removal of a cluster splits the system into noninteracting subsystems ( usually called _ branches _ ) .    the single - site partition function @xmath24 is a similar quantity for a single site , interacting with two cavity fields associated to the two `` branches '' attached to the given site .",
    "it can be written in the following form @xmath31 note that we have two configuration labels @xmath32 even though for a single site , because it is convenient to define the local polymer configurations with respect to two different reference frames , integral with each branch . as a consequence",
    ", the same configuration may be identified by different labels with respect to different branches . moreover",
    ", the statistical weight @xmath33 also has to ensure consistency between the two labels .",
    "this issue should get clearer in appendix  [ app : rec ] , where we report the explicit expression of  @xmath24 .",
    "all the information needed to solve the model is contained in equations ( [ eq : free - energy_density ] ) , ( [ eq : cluster_partition_function ] ) , and  ( [ eq : site_partition_function ] ) , provided explicit expressions of the statistical weights @xmath28 and @xmath33 ( and therefore of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) are derived .",
    "as previously mentioned , equilibrium states are determined by the stationarity conditions for the free energy , namely , @xmath34 which can be easily written in a self - consistent form @xmath35 explicit expressions for the functions @xmath36 are also reported in appendix  [ app : rec ] , along with a proof that 4 cavity fields ( denoted as @xmath37 ) suffice to represent all the relevant configurations .",
    "the recursion equations  ( [ eq : rec ] ) can be solved numerically by a simple iterative algorithm .",
    "note that a proportionality constant remains undetermined , because the free - energy density @xmath38 is invariant under multiplication of each cavity field by a constant , as one can easily verify .",
    "as usual , we fix the constant so as to satisfy , at each iteration , a normalization condition , namely @xmath39 for the benefit of readers who are not familiar with husimi lattice models , let us briefly note that the self - consistent form is not only an efficient way to solve numerically a set of nonlinear simultaneous equations , but it can be interpreted as a self - similarity condition , namely , the equality between the cavity fields associated to a given branch and those of its sub - branches .",
    "indeed , most studies directly derive the recursion equations via self - similarity .",
    "all equilibrium properties of the system can now be derived from the knowledge of the cavity field values satisfying equations  ( [ eq : rec ] ) , along with the expression of the free - energy density , equations ( [ eq : free - energy_density ] ) , ( [ eq : cluster_partition_function ] ) , and  ( [ eq : site_partition_function ] ) . the average number of segments per site , which in the following we shall briefly refer to as _ segment density _ , or simply _ density _ , can be evaluated as @xmath40 note that , in the above derivative , the dependence on  @xmath14 of the cavity fields can be neglected , because we are interested in equilibrium points , and the derivatives of @xmath38 with respect to the cavity fields vanish at such points .",
    "the density  @xmath41 is the main order parameter for our system .",
    "other meaningful observables are the average number of contacts per site ( _ contact density _ ) @xmath42 and the average number of collisions or crossings per site ( respectively , _ collision _ or _ crossing density _ )",
    "@xmath43 explicit expressions for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 can be derived straightforwardly .    in the presence of multiple solutions ( i.e. , fixed points ) of the recursion equations , revealing the occurrence of coexistence phenomena , the free - energy values allow one to discriminate the thermodynamically stable phase , and therefore to determine first - order transitions .",
    "conversely , second - order transitions can be better detected by analyzing the _ stability _ of the solutions .",
    "the latter is a rather technical issue , which we discuss in appendix  [ app : rec ] .",
    "in the framework of the grand - canonical formulation , the phase diagram can be described as a function of the boltzmann weights of the elementary interactions , also denoted as _ activities _ ( in our case @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6 ) , and of the _ fugacity _ variable @xmath14 , which controls the segment density . for given activity values",
    ", we expect a phase transition to occur at a certain fugacity @xmath47 , where the density changes from @xmath48 for @xmath49 to @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "the transition manifold , defined by the function @xmath52 , can be identified as the canonical thermodynamic limit for a single polymer chain , and in particular @xmath53 represents the corresponding helmholtz free - energy density per segment ( in @xmath54 units ) . in the limit @xmath55 ,",
    "the properties of the dense phase are expected to approach those of a single chain ( we shall denote it as the `` single - chain '' limit ) , so that , in particular , the segment density  @xmath41 can be viewed as a measure of the chain compactness .",
    "therefore , a second - order transition represents a swollen state , whereas a first - order transition represents a collapsed state . for the well - known isaw model ( @xmath56 in our scheme ) , increasing the contact activity  @xmath6 ( which usually means lowering the temperature ) drives the system from the former to the latter regime , giving rise to a continuous transition ( theta collapse ) .    solving the recursion equations  ( [ eq : rec ] ) , we find ,",
    "besides the zero - density phase ( also denoted as _ 0  phase _ in the following ) , two different dense phases : an `` ordinary '' one ( _ 1  phase _ ) , and a `` maximally dense '' one ( _ 2  phase _ ) . the 2  phase is characterized by very large values of the segment density @xmath41 and of the crossing - collision density @xmath57 ( quite close to the respective upper bounds @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , and by small values of the contact density @xmath46 ( quite close to @xmath60 ) .",
    "conversely , the 1  phase is characterized by smaller values of @xmath41 and @xmath61 , and larger values of @xmath46 .",
    "the segment density @xmath41 is the natural order parameter for both 0 - 1 and 0 - 2 phase transitions , because the 0  phase is characterized by @xmath48 , whereas @xmath50 in the 1 and 2 phases .",
    "the 1 - 2 transition can not be defined rigorously in terms of densities , but a suitable order parameter is instead the @xmath62 cavity field , which turns out to be strictly positive in the 1  phase and zero in the 2  phase .",
    "let us first analyze the case of a symmetric crossing - collision interaction ( @xmath63 ) , which has been previously denoted as the wu - bradley model .",
    "we shall present a sequence of projections of the grand - canonical phase diagram in the plane @xmath14  vs  @xmath64 , for different fixed values of the contact activity , namely , @xmath65 . note that @xmath66 or @xmath67 means that contacts are energetically favored or disfavored , respectively , whereas the case @xmath68 corresponds to the isat model , with no contact interaction .    the phase diagram for @xmath69",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega=1 - 2 ] .    the transition line between the 0 and 1 phases turns out to be partially first and partially second order",
    "the point separating the two regimes represents a continuous collapse in the single - chain limit , so that it can be viewed as the analogous of the theta point of the isaw model , which is , a tricritical point in the language of @xmath0 models .",
    "we shall denote this point as tc-1 to avoid misunderstandings , because , as previously mentioned , the theta point of the isaw model corresponds to a well - defined universality class , whereas husimi lattice models necessarily belong to a mean - field universality class . in the dense region ( @xmath50 )",
    "a second - order transition line separates the 1 and 2 phases .",
    "this line joins to the transition line with the 0 phase at a critical end - point , which we shall denote as ce-2 .",
    "the latter corresponds , in the single - chain limit , to a continuous transition between two different regimes of the collapsed state .",
    "the regime associated to the first - order portion of the 0 - 1 phase represents a moderately compact state , whose density rapidly increases upon increasing @xmath64 . on the other hand ,",
    "the regime associated to the 0 - 2 transition ( which is all first - order ) represents a very compact state , with a large majority of doubly - visited sites , whose density value is almost saturated around @xmath70 .",
    "these observations can be confirmed by inspection of the density contour lines , reported in fig .",

    "[ fig : omega=0 - 5 ] displays the @xmath14 vs @xmath64 phase diagram in the particular case @xmath71 .",
    "the tc-1 point disappears , so that the 0 - 1 transition line is now all second - order .",
    "conversely , the 1 - 2 transition line turns out to be partially second and partially first order . as a consequence , the 0 - 1 transition line terminates in a critical end - point , which we denote as ce-1 .",
    "the latter also marks the separation between the first - order portion of the 1 - 2 transition line and the ( all first order ) 0 - 2 transition line . in the single - chain limit",
    "the ce-1 point represents a discontinuous ( first order ) collapse transition to the very compact state with almost saturated density .    analyzing the evolution of the @xmath14  vs  @xmath64 phase diagram between the two regimes observed , from @xmath69 to @xmath71",
    ", we realize that all the relevant changes occur precisely at @xmath11 , that is , in the case of the pure isat model .",
    "the phase diagram for this case is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega=1 - 0_isat - model ] .    we can observe that all four of the `` special points '' defined above , namely , tc-1 , tc-2 , ce-1 , and ce-2 degenerate into a unique multicritical point ( tagged as mc ) . in the single - chain limit , this point still represents an abrupt collapse transition to the saturated compact state , but it turns out to exhibit rather peculiar features .",
    "first of all , it is located precisely at @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ". these values , which we can determine with very high numerical precision ( of the order of ten decimal places ) , coincide with those pointed out ( though with lower precision ) by both simulations  @xcite and transfer - matrix techniques  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can observe that all the density contour lines in the 1  phase converge toward the mc point .",
    "this means that precisely _ at _ the mc point there exists a continuum of solutions of the recursion equations ( i.e. , a continuum of minima of the free energy ) , all with the same free - energy value , but with densities ranging from zero ( the 0-phase value ) up to the 2-phase value . in other words",
    ", we can state that the 0 phase and the 2 phase remain distinct , but the free energy barrier associated with the 0 - 2 ( first - order ) transition vanishes precisely at the mc point .",
    "as far as the single - chain limit is concerned , we might analogously say that the collapse transition of the isat model is a discontinuous transition with a zero free - energy barrier . finally , it is noticeable that both the location and the specific features of the mc point are preserved even in the bethe lattice solution . in this case",
    "all the details reported above can be probed analytically , as discussed in appendix  [ app : bethe ] . in particular",
    ", it turns out that , in a landau expansion of the variational free energy , the derivatives of any order vanish precisely at the mc point .",
    "this is just the mean - field representation of a multicritical point of infinite order , which remarkably agrees with the characterization of the isat theta point , recently given by nahum and coworkers .",
    "@xcite    to complete the picture of the phase diagram for the wu - bradley model , we have systematically analyzed the evolution of the `` special points '' as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "this analysis leads to the graph reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegatau ] , which can also be regarded as a single - chain phase diagram .",
    "indeed , all the special points , except tc-2 , lie on the @xmath74 manifold ( i.e. , on the 0-phase boundary ) , and represent certain conformational transitions for a single polymer chain in the thermodynamic limit ( note that all the points except mc evolve into lines upon varying @xmath6 ) .",
    "in particular : tc-1 represents a continuous isaw - like collapse from a swollen state to a moderately compact state , ce-2 represents another continuous collapse from the moderately compact to the highly compact or saturated state ; ce-1 represents a direct discontinuous ( first - order ) collapse from the swollen state to the highly compact state .",
    "finally , mc can be regarded as a limiting case of ce-1 , in which the free - energy barrier vanishes .",
    "let us now switch to the general case @xmath12 .",
    "let us note that , in principle , a complete description of the phase diagram would require the exploration of the whole four - parameters space ( @xmath75 ) , which would be a rather heavy task .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that the description can be considerably simplified by introducing suitable alternative parameters , namely , a particular _",

    "[ fig : omegatau ] ) , we can argue that , as soon as @xmath88 ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) , the @xmath11 line will cross the ce-1 line , which means that the aisat polymer undergoes a first - order like collapse from the swollen state to the highly - compact state .",
    "conversely , when @xmath90 ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) , the @xmath11 line will cross both the tc-1 line and the ce-2 line , which means that the aisat polymer undergoes two different continuous transitions , from the swollen state to the moderately - compact state , and then to the highly - compact one .",
    "these two transition scenarios are qualitatively equivalent to those previously reported for the wu - bradley model , respectively for @xmath92 and @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , such an equivalence appears rather intuitive , because a collision interaction is somehow similar , on a shorter length scale , to a contact interaction ( even though the former necessarily implies polymer bending , whereas the latter does not ) . as a consequence ,",
    "a symmetric isat model ( @xmath80 ) with the addition of a favored nearest - neighbor contact interaction ( @xmath93 ) can be argued to be similar to an aisat model with collisions preferred to crossings ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "analogously , a symmetric isat model with the addition of a disfavored contact interaction ( @xmath95 ) appears similar to an aisat model with collisions penalized with respect to crossing ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "we have devoted special attention to the aisat model , because it has recently been the subject of different studies on the ordinary 2d square lattice  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauctaux ] we report the single - chain phase diagram for the husimi lattice case .    in the @xmath4 vs @xmath5 diagram , the collapse transition looks like a single line passing through the mc point ( which occurs for @xmath96 ) , separating the swollen state from the highly - compact state . nevertheless , the mapping on the alternative parameters @xmath64 and @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tauctaux ] inset ) reveals the fine structure of this `` line '' .",
    "in fact , for @xmath97 , the transition line splits into two different lines of tc-1 and ce-2 points , whereas for @xmath98 it turns out to be a line of ce-1 points , which is , a first - order collapse .",
    "the similarity of the @xmath64  vs  @xmath99 diagram for the aisat model with the @xmath64  vs  @xmath6 diagram of the wu - bradley model is now evident .",
    "the most relevant difference is that , in the latter case , the tc-1 and ce-2 lines become well separated for large @xmath6 values , whereas , in the former case , they remain very close to each other over the whole range of admissible @xmath83 values . in figs .",
    "[ fig : tau - x=1_collision - model ] and  [ fig : tau - c=1_crossing - model ] we report grand - canonical phase diagrams for the two special cases @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "this two cases have been respectively denoted as _ colliding model _ and _ crossing model _",
    "@xcite , since either only collisions or only crossings are energetically favored , even though _ both _ collisions and crossings are always allowed .",
    "we can fully appreciate the analogy with the @xmath66 and @xmath67 cases of the wu - bradley model ( figs . [",
    "fig : omega=1 - 2 ] and  [ fig : omega=0 - 5 ] , respectively ) , even though at a much smaller energy scale .",
    "let us now discuss our results , with special attention to comparing them with those appeared in the literature for corresponding two - dimensional models .",
    "as far as the wu - bradley model ( @xmath102 ) is concerned , we have obtained a nice agreement with the ( single - chain ) phase diagram proposed by bedini and coworkers  @xcite . the 0 - 2 transition ( ce-1 line in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegatau ] ) is conjectured to be first order , in agreement with our prediction .",
    "moreover , the 0 - 1 transition is conjectured to be in the isaw - theta universality class , and , even though in this case we can not give a corresponding prediction for critical exponents , we find it significant that our 0 - 1 transition line is indeed made up of tricritical ( tc-1 ) points .",
    "note also that for @xmath9 ( isaw model ) the tc-1 point occurs at @xmath103 , to be compared with the theta point of the 2d square lattice model , occurring at @xmath104  @xcite .",
    "finally , the 1 - 2 transition is not characterized precisely in the cited article , due to difficulties in simulating dense polymers , but there is reasonable evidence that it is a continuous transition , which is also in agreement with our prediction .",
    "on top of this , bedini and coworkers identify the merging point of the above transitions with the isat collapse , characterized by specific properties ( putatively , an infinite - order multicritical point  @xcite ) , which disappear as soon as an arbitrarily small contact interaction is introduced .",
    "there is indeed a striking analogy with the mc  point of our husimi - lattice model .",
    "we also find it noticeable that the husimi - lattice solution reproduces some fine details of the 2d phase diagram , for instance , the slight positive slope of the ce-1 line and the precise location of the mc point .",
    "as far as the aisat model ( @xmath11 ) is concerned , the situation is more involved . for the case of preferred crossings ( @xmath98 ) ,",
    "our prediction , that the collapse transition becomes first order , agrees with foster s transfer - matrix results  @xcite . in the cited reference ,",
    "it is not possible to estimate the precise point at which the change of regime takes place , but the results seem to be compatible with our scenario .",
    "unfortunately , the first - order transition is not confirmed by bedini and coworkers simulations  @xcite , which conversely predict , for the _ crossing model _",
    "( @xmath101 ) , an isaw - like transition , with a moderately compact collapsed state .",
    "let us note that , probably with an eye to foster s findings , the latter authors report having observed some evidence of a multiply - peaked probability distribution , which seems nonetheless to become unimodal at large lengths . our scenario might be compatible with such not fully definite results , because the close proximity of the tc-2 point ( where the 1 - 2 transition becomes critical ) to the ce-1 point ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tau - c=1_crossing - model ] ) implies a very weak free - energy barrier , which might in fact give rise to a broad probability distribution , rather than two sharp peaks .",
    "note indeed in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega=0 - 5 ] the much larger distance between the tc-2 and ce-1 points for the wu - bradley model with @xmath71 , where the first - order transition is clearly pointed out by the simulation  @xcite .    in the opposite case of preferred collisions ( @xmath94 ) ,",
    "a comparison with 2d findings presents even more difficulties .",
    "our results predict a two - stage collapse , with a tc-1 point followed by a ce-2 point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tau - x=1_collision - model ] ) . as mentioned in the text , both",
    "these points correspond to continuous transitions , the former ( which we have conjectured to be isaw - like ) toward a moderately - compact state , and the latter toward a highly - compact one .",
    "again , due to the close proximity of the two points in the parameters space , we believe that such a scenario is not incompatible with bedini and coworkers simulations  @xcite , predicting a highly - dense collapsed phase for the _ colliding model _ ( @xmath105 ) . on the other hand , foster s transfer - matrix results  @xcite seem to suggest that the isat critical properties extend to the whole range of preferred collisions ( or penalized crossings ) @xmath106 , but the validity of these results ( for the pure isat case itself  @xcite ) has recently been questioned , by means of field - theoretic arguments  @xcite , pointing out the presence of very strong logarithmic corrections .",
    "the limiting case @xmath13 ( visaw model ) is worth a separate discussion , because in this case an exact solution  @xcite of the corresponding @xmath0 model ( due to blte and nienhuis  @xcite ) points out a specific universality class , different from that of the isaw .",
    "the critical exponent values predicted by the exact solution turn out to be quite elusive , since transfer - matrix approaches  @xcite give incompatible results , whereas monte carlo simulations  @xcite are almost compatible ( at least for the @xmath107 exponent ) with the isaw universality class itself",
    ". a careful investigation of the blte - nienhuis theta state , recently performed by vernier , jacobsen , and saleur  @xcite , suggests that so difficult numerical estimates might arise from the peculiar nature of the associated conformal field theory , characterized by a continuous spectrum of critical exponents . in order to reconcile our phase diagram for the visaw case ( in fact practically equivalent to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : tau - x=1_collision - model ] ) with the exact results , we should postulate that the actual collapse transition is indeed the tc-1 point , so that the blte - nienhuis theta state should be associated to a different object , which we might tentatively identify with the ce-2 point .",
    "of course , on the sole basis of our arguments , this possibility is nothing more than speculation , but we find it quite intriguing , because it seems not to be inconsistent with the most up - to - date results  @xcite , still inconclusive about the role of the different integrable points in the phase diagram . on the other hand , a slight evidence supporting our interpretation is provided by the fact that the blte - nienhuis point is characterized by a nonzero density  @xcite , and that , approached upon increasing fugacity , it corresponds to a discontinuous transition  @xcite .",
    "both features qualitatively agree with our predictions for the ce-2 point .",
    "let us finally spend a few words about the analytical technique that we have used in this article . even though the solution of husimi and bethe lattice models is a very standard technique  @xcite , we would like to emphasize that our variational - free - energy approach considerably simplifies the derivation of the recursion equations , which may be of use in particular when dealing with models of considerable complexity like the current one .",
    "this approach is not fully original , because it has been demonstrated for instance in certain specialized literature dealing with spin glasses ( where a _ quenched _ variational free energy is considered )  @xcite , but , to the best of our knowledge , it has never been practically exploited , at least in the context of polymer models  @xcite .",
    "in this appendix , we shall report a detailed derivation of the recursion equations for the husimi - lattice model .",
