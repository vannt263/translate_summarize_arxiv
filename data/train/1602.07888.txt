    "the main purpose of the current work is to investigate a singular mathematical behaviour , called _ quenching _ , of the solutions of the following non - local parabolic problem : & & u_t - u = q_t:=(0,t ) , [ eqn:1 ] + & & u=0 ( 0,t ) , [ bc ] + & & u(x,0)=u_0(x ) , x,[ic ] where @xmath0 are positive constants , @xmath1 , @xmath2 is a bounded domain with smooth boundary @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a continuous function in @xmath5 such that @xmath6 .",
    "the motivation for studying problem - is that it arises as a mathematical model which describes operation of some electrostatic actuated micro - electro - mechanical systems ( mems ) .",
    "mems \" more precisely refers to precision devices which combine mechanical processes with electrical circuits . in particular ,",
    "electrostatic actuation is a popular application of mems .",
    "mems devices range in size from millimetres down to microns , and involve precision mechanical components that can be constructed using semiconductor manufacturing technologies .",
    "various electrostatic actuated mems have been developed and used in a wide variety of devices applied as sensors and have fluid - mechanical , optical , radio frequency ( rf ) , data - storage , and biotechnology applications .",
    "examples of microdevices of this kind include microphones , temperature sensors , rf switches , resonators , accelerometers , micromirrors , micropumps , microvalves , data - storage devices etc .",
    ", @xcite .",
    "the principal part of such a electrostatic actuated mems device usually consists of an elastic plate suspended above a rigid ground plate .",
    "typically the elastic plate ( or membrane ) is held fixed at two ends while the other two edges remain free to move .",
    "an alternative configuration could entail the plate or membrane being held fixed around its entire edge .",
    "when a potential difference @xmath7 is applied between the membrane and the plate , the membrane deflects towards the ground plate . under the realistic assumption that the width of the gap , between the membrane and the bottom plate , is small compared to the device length , and when the configuration of the two parallel plates is connected in series with a fixed voltage source and a fixed capacitor , then the deformation of the elastic membrane @xmath8",
    "is described by the dimensionless equation , see @xcite . in @xmath9 @xmath10",
    "is the tension in the membrane , @xmath11 the characteristic length ( diameter ) of the domain @xmath12 @xmath13 the characteristic width of the gap between the membrane and the fixed ground plate ( electrode ) , and @xmath14 the permittivity of free space .",
    "the integral in arises from the fact that the device is embedded in an electrical circuit with a capacitor of fixed capacitance .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 denotes the ratio of this fixed capacitance to a reference capacitance of the device . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that @xmath16 .",
    "( the limiting case @xmath17 corresponds to the configuration where there is no capacitor in the circuit . )",
    "if the edges of the membrane are kept fixed then dirichlet boundary conditions of the form ( [ bc ] ) are imposed .",
    "it is usually supposed that the elastic membrane is initially at rest , so that @xmath18 however , in this work , we consider more general non - negative initial conditions @xmath19 . for a more detailed derivation of see @xcite .    from many experiments",
    "it is clear that the applied voltage @xmath7 controls the operation of the mems device .",
    "it is observed that when @xmath7 exceeds a critical threshold @xmath20 , called the _ pull - in voltage _ , then the phenomenon of _ touch - down _ ( or _ pull - in instability _ as it is also known in mems literature ) occurs when the elastic membrane touches the rigid ground plate . for the mathematical problem -",
    ", this means that there is some critical value @xmath21 of the parameter @xmath22 above which singular behaviour should be anticipated .",
    "focusing on the nonlinear term of problem , one can notice that such singular behaviour is possible only when @xmath8 takes the value @xmath23 , a phenomenon known in the mathematical literature as _ quenching _ , see also section  [ fq ] .",
    "from the point of view of applications it is important to determine whether quenching occurs and , if it does , to clarify when , how and where it might happen .    when @xmath17 we obtain the following local ( standard ) parabolic problem , [ local ] & & u_t - u= q_t , + & & u=0 ( 0,t ) , + & & u(x,0)=u_0(x ) x , whose quenching behaviour has been extensively studied in the papers @xcite .",
    "the quenching behaviour of the solutions of - has been also studied in @xcite but questions regarding : + @xmath24 occurrence of quenching for @xmath25 where @xmath26 is defined by ; + @xmath27 determination of the quenching rate ; + @xmath28 establishment of the form of the quenching set ; + were left open .",
    "these questions are addressed in the current work for radially symmetric problems with the extra assumption that the initial data decreases with distance from the centre of the domain .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the problem - shares some common features with a non - local problem which exhibits blow - up and models control of mass , and which was investigated in @xcite .",
    "however , the methods we use in this paper to examine finite - time quenching are rather different from the those of @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ ss ] a brief study of corresponding steady - state problem",
    "is presented ; this will be used for proving the occurrence of finite - time quenching in section  [ fq ] .",
    "section  [ spq ] is devoted to determination of the form of the quenching set and a bound on the quenching rate .",
    "finally section [ nr ] presents some numerical results confirming some of the analytical results obtained in the preceding sections .",
    "in this section a brief study of the steady - state problem corresponding to - is provided .",
    "this problem has the form @xmath29 where we always have @xmath30 in @xmath5 for a ( classical ) solution of .",
    "let [ crl ] ^*:=\\{>0 : } , then @xmath31 for any dimension @xmath32 see @xcite . for more on the structure of the solution set of see @xcite .    for the purposes of the current work we will need the notion of a weak solution of problem .",
    "in particular we define the following form of weak solution for .",
    "[ def0 ] a function @xmath33 is called a * weak finite - energy solution * of if there exists a sequence @xmath34 satisfying as @xmath35 & & w_jw h_0 ^ 1()[ws1 ] , + & & w_jw[ws2 ] + & & l^1()[ws3 ] , + & & l^1()[ws4 ] and w_j+ 0 l^2()[ws5 ] .",

    "we now restrict our discussion to radially symmetric problems , so that we may take @xmath37 with solutions which are decreasing in @xmath38 . the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath39",
    "is then provided by the following :    [ sp1 ] for radially symmetric problems , with radially decreasing solutions , the suprema of the spectra of the classical and weak problems are identical : @xmath40    since any classical solution of is also a weak finite - energy solution , @xmath41 .    on the other hand , we can take @xmath42 arbitrarily close to @xmath39 so that there is a weak finite - energy solution @xmath43 for @xmath44 . since @xmath43 is decreasing with @xmath45 , either @xmath46 for @xmath47 or",
    "there is some @xmath48 such that @xmath49 for @xmath50 . in the latter case @xmath51",
    "becomes infinite so that @xmath52 is then a weak finite - energy solution of @xmath53 satisfying @xmath45 , as well as the boundary condition @xmath54 , giving @xmath55 .",
    "we must then have @xmath56 for @xmath57 and it follows that @xmath43 is regular for @xmath57 .    for @xmath58 , simple integration now gives that the solution is classical . for @xmath59 , following now @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the ( classical ) problem can be solved in @xmath60 to find that there is precisely one limiting value of @xmath22 , say @xmath61 , for which @xmath62 and @xmath52 is then a weak finite - energy solution but not classical .",
    "depending upon the value of @xmath63 , @xmath64 or @xmath65 . in either case , @xmath66 .",
    "local - in - time existence of a solution to problem - is established in corollary 2.4 of @xcite by constructing a proper lower - upper pair or solutions .",
    "moreover the solution @xmath8 exists as long as @xmath67 and it ceases to exist once @xmath8 reaches 1 . in particular we have :    the solution @xmath68 of problem - quenches at some point @xmath69 in finite time @xmath70 if there exist sequences @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 as @xmath75 such that @xmath76 as @xmath75 . in the case where @xmath77 we say that @xmath68 quenches in infinite time at @xmath78    the set = \\{x^ * & | & + & & x_kx^ * , t_kt_q u(x_k , t_k)1 k } is called the quenching set .    some finite - time quenching results for large values of the parameter @xmath79 have been proved in @xcite , while the authors in @xcite proved a quenching result for initial data @xmath4 quite close to @xmath80    in the current section we are working towards the improvement of the preceding quenching results under some circumstances . before we proceed with the proof of our quenching results we will present some auxiliary lemmata .",

    "the next step is to provide another key estimate for @xmath90 which will allow us not only to prove finite - time quenching but also to characterize the form of the quenching set .",

    "this function is determined by the scale invariants of the problem , @xcite . in our case , for the semilinear parabolic equation of the form @xmath266 for @xmath267 , an appropriate monitor function should be @xmath268 in this case .    at the same time",
    "we need also a rescaling of time of the form @xmath269 for @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is a function determining the way that the time scale changes as the solution approaches the singularity , and is given by @xmath272 ( again see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition the evolution of @xmath273 is given by a moving mesh pde which has the form @xmath274 . here",
    "@xmath275 is a small parameter accounting for the relaxation time scale .",
    "thus finally we obtain a system of ode s for @xmath257 and @xmath276 and the ode system takes the form @xmath277    we may apply now a discretization in space and we have @xmath278    therefore the resulting ode system to be solved , for @xmath279 will have the form @xmath280 where the matrix @xmath281 has the block form @xmath282,\\quad y=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c }   t(\\tau)\\\\   { \\bf u}\\\\    { \\bf x } \\end{array } \\right ] , \\quad b = g(u)\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 1\\\\ \\delta_x^2 { \\bf u } + \\lambda \\frac{1}{\\left(1-{\\bf u}\\right)^2 \\left(1+{\\mathcal i}(u)\\right)^2}\\\\ \\delta_{\\xi } ( { \\mathcal m}\\delta x_{\\xi } ) \\end{array } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath283 is an approximation of the integral @xmath284 , using , for example , simpson s rule .    for the solution of the above system a standard ode solver , such as the matlab function  ode15i \" , can be used .",

    "using now @xmath288 , we can see the evolution of the solution profile against space for various times in figure  [ fig : prof ] .",
    "again we take @xmath289 and use @xmath286 .    regarding the behaviour of the solution near quenching with respect to time ,",

    "note also that the local quenching behaviour of our non - local problem is expected to be like that of the standard problem , ( [ local ] ) , because of the boundedness of the integral in the non - local term , lemma  [ est2 ] . )",
    "we look briefly at the radial symmetric problem in two dimensions , @xmath299 taking , for a change , @xmath300 .",

    "figure [ radprof ] shows the profile of the solution for various times . we again take @xmath289 and use @xmath286 .",
    "we see that the behaviour is very similar to the one - dimensional problem .",
    "temporary flattening can again be observed .",
    "our results clearly easily extend to other problems of a similar form .",
    "for example , the analysis holds with @xmath302 , the right - hand side in ( [ eqn : r1 ] ) , again given by @xmath303 now with @xmath304 and @xmath305 positive and satisfying @xmath306 as @xmath307 for some @xmath308 .",
