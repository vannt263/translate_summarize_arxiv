    "a two - user genie - aided cognitive interference channel ( cic ) is a two - user interference channel ( ic ) in which one of the transmitters ( termed the secondary transmitter , here @xmath0 ) knows the other transmitter s message ( termed the primary transmitter , here @xmath1 ) noncausally ( i.e. , by a genie ) .",
    "devroye , mitran , and tarokh ( dmt ) in their premier paper , titled `` achievable rates in cognitive radio channels , '' derived an achievable rate region for the discrete memoryless cic ( [ [ dmt : cic ] , th . 1 ] ) .",
    "we observe that the coding scheme proposed in @xcite is correct but unfortunately the derived achievable rate region is incorrect because of occurring some mistakes in decoding and analysis of error probability .",
    "we first intuitively show that some rate - terms in the dmt rate region seem to be incorrect ( in fact , they are incomplete ) .",
    "then , we correct the dmt achievable rate region and thereby show that the corrected achievable rate region includes the dmt rate region given in @xcite .",
    "the two - user discrete memoryless cic ( dm - cic ) , denoted by @xmath2 consists of four finite alphabets @xmath3 and a collection of conditional probability mass functions @xmath4 on @xmath5 .",
    "the channel is memoryless in the sense that @xmath6 .    in this channel transmitter @xmath7 ,",
    "wants to send a message @xmath8 , uniformly distributed on @xmath9 , to its respective receiver .",
    "the primary transmitter @xmath1 generates the codeword @xmath10 as @xmath11 , and the secondary transmitter @xmath0 , being non - causally aware of the primary message , generates the codeword @xmath12 as @xmath13 . the decoding function @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 .    a pair @xmath16 of non - negative real values is called an achievable rate for the dm - cic if for any given @xmath17 and for any sufficiently large @xmath18 , there exists a sequence of encoding functions @xmath19 , and a sequence of decoding functions @xmath20 , such that    l p_e^(n)=p_r\\ { g_1(y_1^n ) m_1   g_2(y_2^n ) m_2  |   ( m_1,m_2 )   }    where @xmath21 is the average probability of error .",

    "we first saw that the rate - terms ( 2.7)(2.9 ) and ( 2.13)(2.16 ) of @xmath36 intuitively seem to be incomplete because of not utilizing some dependencies among rvs .",
