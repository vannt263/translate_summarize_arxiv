    "over the past decade , we have witnessed enormous and rapid progress in the field of cavity quantum optomechanics , the field of research exploring the coupling of optical radiation to mechanical motion from both theoretical and experimental points of view ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this field has emerged as an ideal platform to explore the applicability of quantum mechanics to systems of much larger sizes and masses than the atomic and particle scales thanks to sophisticated experiments , including the cooling of the mechanical motion down to the quantum ground state @xcite , the detection of quantized mechanical motion @xcite , coherent state transfer between cavity and mechanical modes @xcite , the realization of squeezed light @xcite , and the preparation of mechanical squeezed state @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the exploration of quantum features in optomechanical systems has not only led to the development of novel applications , but also opened new insights into the fundamental properties of nature .",
    "the examples include precision measurements @xcite , the development of hybrid systems @xcite , probing open quantum system dynamics @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite , and probing the interface between quantum mechanics and gravity @xcite . + quantum squeezing of a mechanical oscillator , characterized by an uncertainty of a single motional quadrature ( position or momentum ) beyond the standard quantum limit , is one of the key macroscopic quantum effects that can be utilized to investigate the quantum to classical transition and to improve the precision of quantum measurements such as the detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "although only a few experimental realizations have been reported very recently @xcite , many proposals have been put forward to generate and enhance mechanical squeezing in optomechanical systems .",
    "some examples include the conditional quantum measurements @xcite , parametric amplification @xcite , coupling a nanomechanical oscillator to an atomic gas @xcite , quantum reservoir engineering @xcite , exploiting the periodically - modulated driving on the dissipative optomechanical system @xcite , and squeezing via intracavity nonlinear crystal @xcite .",
    "+ research on the interaction of squeezed light with matter has been one of the most attractive issues in quantum optics over the past many years . in particular , considerable attention has been directed at modifying the radiative properties of atom via interaction with a squeezed light .",
    "the basis for this attention originates from the prediction of a sub - natural linewidth in the spontaneous emission spectrum of a two - level atom in a broadband squeezed vacuum bath @xcite .",
    "this effect results from the quantum correlations between pairs of photons in the squeezed vacuum , produced , e.g. , by the process of parametric down - conversion , which lead to reduced quantum fluctuations in one quadrature of the field driving the atom .",
    "following from this prediction , a number of other interesting and novel quantum effects , arising from quantum correlations and noise reduction in the squeezed vacuum interacting with an atom , have been studied .",
    "some of these include sub - natural linewidth in resonance fluorescence spectrum @xcite as well as in weak field absorption spectrum @xcite , population trapping @xcite , anomalous resonance fluorescence @xcite , hole burning and dispersive profiles in the probe absorption spectrum @xcite , and linear two - photon excitation @xcite .",
    "the above - cited studies have been carried out assuming the squeezed vacuum to be broadband , i.e. , its width to be much larger than the atomic linewidth and the rabi frequency of the driving field .",
    "however , experimental realizations of squeezed light by subthreshold optical parametric oscillators @xcite indicate that the bandwidth of the squeezed light is typically of the order of the atomic linewidth . in this sense ,",
    "some other studies have been performed to explore the response of a two - level atom to a squeezed vacuum excitation with finite - bandwidth@xcite .",
    "the results reveal that the atomic dynamics , radiative properties , and photon statistics of the emitted radiation exhibit unique features which do not appear for a broadband excitation . + in comparison with atomic systems ,",
    "the interaction of mechanical oscillators with squeezed light has not been investigated extensively .",
    "the relevant investigations are mainly focused on the generation and enhancement of mechanical squeezing in an optomechanical cavity by injecting finite - bandwidth @xcite or broadband@xcite squeezed vacuum light into the cavity . aside from the generation of mechanical squeezing ,",
    "injecting the optomechanical systems with squeezed light may lead to the entanglement between two separate nanomechanical oscillators @xcite and electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in atomic systems , quantum coherent control of mechanical motion is state of the art @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fabricated nanomechanical and micromechanical resonators extend this level of control to a different realm , of objects with large masses and of devices with a great flexibility in design and the possibility to integrate them in on - chip architectures .",
    "+ in this paper , the response of a movable mirror in an optomechanical cavity to dpo and ndpo finite - bandwidth squeezed vacuum states as input probe fields is investigated and the results are compared to the case of broad - band squeezed vacuum injection . in particular , the effects of the bandwidth and squeezing parameters of the squeezed vacuum input on the displacement and momentum fluctuations spectra as well as the mechanical squeezing of the movable mirror are analyzed . we show that a squeezed vacuum of bandwidth smaller than the cavity decay rate induces certain effects that are unique to finite - bandwidth excitations and the quantum nature of squeezed light . we show some anomalous features such as pimple , hole burning , and dispersion - like profile in the spectra of the movable mirror which has not yet been studied in optomechanical systems .",
    "+ we also study the role of mirror temperature in the appearance or suppression of these features .",
    "we find that when hole burning appears , the two - photon correlation of the incident squeezed vacuum is transferred to the spectral density of movable mirror , and accordingly one can use the optomechanical cavity for detecting the two - photon correlation in the driving squeezed vacuum .",
    "+ we also examine the squeezing of the position and momentum quadratures of the movable mirror and analyze how the mechanical squeezing is affected by the squeezing parameters as well as the type ( dpo or ndpo ) of the squeezed vacuum input .",
    "the results reveal that the maximum mechanical squeezing occurs for the case of finite - bandwidth dpo squeezed vacuum input .",

    "we have found that the squeezing parameters as well as the mirror temperature affect the hole burning , and the phase of driving squeezed vacuum plays a key role in the appearance of dispersive profile which appears at high intensities of the squeezed vacuum input .",
    "when the hole burning appears , the two - photon correlation of the driving squeezed vacuum is transferred to the mechanical spectra of the movable mirror .",
    "we have also found that in the case of finite - bandwidth ndpo squeezed vacuum input when the pump laser power increases two pimples appear in the momentum spectrum around the squeezing carrier frequency @xmath18 , indicating the two - mode nature of the driving squeezed vacuum . for the case of dpo squeezed vacuum input",
    ", only one pimple appears at frequency @xmath18 .",
    "these features strongly depend on the squeezing bandwidth and do not extend into the regime of broadband squeezed vacuum excitation .",
