    "optomechanics studies systems composed of a mechanical oscillator , such as a mobile mirror or membrane , and an electromagnetic field interacting by means of radiation pressure or thermal forces @xcite .",
    "some of the main attractions of this area come from the facts that it provides systems that can interact with other quantum systems such as cold atoms @xcite , that can serve as microwave to optical converters in quantum information networks @xcite , and that are very promising to study the quantum physics of macroscopic objects @xcite . in order to do the latter",
    ", one needs to create and manipulate quantum states of motion in the mechanical oscillator .",
    "in particular , the mechanical oscillator has already been prepared in its quantum ground state of motion in various optomechanical systems either by cryogenic cooling @xcite or laser cooling using cavity fields @xcite , and it has also been prepared in a squeezed state @xcite .",
    "moreover , some experimental set ups have demonstrated single - phonon control in the mechanical oscillator using a superconducting qubit @xcite , non - classical correlations with longer lifetimes between single photons and phonons from the mechanical oscillator @xcite , the generation of entanglement between a microwave field and a mechanical oscillator @xcite , and the generation of quantum squeezed states of light @xcite .",
    "some of the technical difficulties of these experiments consist in the production of quantum states with sufficiently long lifetimes and that they operate at very low temperatures .",
    "the situation is now more encouraging because mechanical resonators for optomechanics that may allow studies in the quantum regime and at room temperature have recently been developed @xcite .",
    "optomechanical systems are usually described in terms of a harmonic oscillator model @xcite where the mechanical oscillator can only have small displacements around an equilibrium position .",
    "nevertheless , there are works that go beyond this and describe other physical phenomena arising from coupling the electromagnetic field with the motional degrees of freedom of the mechanical oscillator , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular , @xcite develops a scattering theory that allows the description of a point - like scatterer ( e.g. , an atom or mobile mirror with infinitesimal thickness ) coupled to the electromagnetic field through radiation pressure , while @xcite presented a model from first principles to describe a mobile mirror with non - zero thickness interacting with the electromagnetic field . in this article",
    "we use the model of @xcite to describe a one dimensional cavity composed of two perfect , fixed mirrors and a mobile membrane with non - zero thickness in between .",
    "this set up is frequently referred to in the literature as the _ membrane - in - the - middle optomechanical set up _ @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is one of the paradigmatic optomechanical systems because it has been noted to combine good properties of the cavity ( e.g. , highly reflective mirrors ) with good properties of the mechanical oscillator ( e.g. , a very thin , light membrane that can be moved easily by radiation pressure ) .",
    "the objective of this work is to determine how the cavity electromagnetic field evolves in the presence of the mobile membrane .",
    "this has the purpose of improving and extending the understanding of the electromagnetic field in the presence of moving boundaries .",
    "in particular , the work has the novelties of using a model deduced from first principles , that the membrane is not restricted to small deviations around an equilibrium position , that we establish how , why , and when the electromagnetic field follows adiabatically a single cavity mode , and that we deduce and give a physical picture of how and why other cavity modes are excited .",
    "moreover , we obtain simple analytic formulas that describe the cavity field to good approximation and that provide physical insight to its evolution .",
    "we note that some results were presented without giving any proofs in the conference @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the physical system under consideration and we establish the equation governing the evolution of the electromagnetic field . it is a wave equation modified by terms that arise from the fact that the membrane s properties are altered when it is in motion . in section iii",
    "we review the evolution of the field when the membrane is fixed and , in particular , we introduce the modes of the cavity . in sections iv and v we determine to good approximation the evolution of the field when the membrane can move and when only one mode is initially excited . in section",
    "vi we extend the results to the case of several initially excited modes .",
    "finally , a summary and the conclusions are given in section vii .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional cavity composed of two perfect , fixed mirrors and a mobile membrane in between , see figure [ figure1 ] . here",
    "we are assuming that the mirrors and the membrane are slabs of infinite length and width that are parallel to each other and that there is vacuum between the membrane and the mirrors .",
    "this system is frequently referred to in the literature as the _ membrane - in - the - middle _ optomechanical set up @xcite . to describe it we consider a coordinate system such that the @xmath0-axis is perpendicular to the faces of the mirrors and the membrane",
    ", the interior of the cavity extends from @xmath1 to @xmath2 where the boundaries of the perfect mirrors are located , and the midpoint of the membrane along the @xmath0-axis at time @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 , see figure [ figure1 ] . in the rest of the article we refer to @xmath4 as the _ position of the membrane _ and",
    "we assume that the membrane is a linear , isotropic , non - magnetizable , non - conducting , and uncharged dielectric of thickness @xmath5 when it is at rest .",
    "moreover , the electric susceptibility of the membrane is denoted by @xmath6 $ ] and we assume that it is piecewise continuous with a piecewise continuous derivative , non - negative , and that it vanishes outside of the membrane , that is , we assume that @xmath7 \\ = \\",

    "the motion can be due to an external agent or to the radiation pressure exerted by an electromagnetic field inside the cavity .",
    "schematic representation of the system under consideration .",
    "the outer slabs are the perfect , fixed mirrors of the cavity , while the slab in the middle is the membrane .",
    "the interior of the cavity goes from @xmath1 to @xmath2 where the boundaries of the mirrors are located .",
    "the midpoint of the membrane along the @xmath0-axis at time @xmath3 is @xmath4 and the membrane has thickness @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath8-axis points into the page.,width=302 ]    inside the cavity there is an electromagnetic field and we use gaussian units to describe it .",
    "we assume that it can be deduced from vector and scalar potentials of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a unit vector in the direction of the positive @xmath11-axis .",
    "hence , the electric and magnetic fields are given by @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are unit vectors in the direction of the positive @xmath0 and @xmath8 axes , respectively .",
    "we now introduce the equation governing the dynamics of the potential @xmath16 . in order to do this",
    "we first assume that    1 .",
    "@xmath17 is the characteristic wavelength of the electromagnetic field , 2 .",

    "hence , @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] are the electric susceptibility and the dielectric function of the membrane with a non - dimensional argument @xmath34 $ ] , respectively .",
    "we now discuss the interpretation of the parameter @xmath35 in ( [ adimensionales ] ) .",
    "observe that the time - scale in which the electromagnetic field evolves appreciably can be taken to be @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 is the time - scale @xmath36 in which the field evolves appreciably divided by the time - scale @xmath37 in which the membrane moves appreciably .",
    "since the electromagnetic field usually evolves more rapidly than the membrane , one usually has @xmath38 or , equivalently , @xmath39 .",
    "for example , using the parameters of the membrane - in - the - middle optomechanical set up in @xcite one has @xmath40 hz , @xmath41 hz , and , consequently , @xmath42 .    before proceeding",
    "it is important to give an interpretation of the first and second derivatives of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "from the fact that @xmath19 and from ( [ adimensionales ] ) one has @xmath44 here the @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the first and second derivatives of @xmath47 with respect to its argument @xmath24 , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the first and second derivatives of @xmath50 with respect to its argument @xmath51 .",

    "our results are valid for both cases because further below we assume that @xmath59 and this allows us to solve ( [ 8 ] ) using the method of multiple scales @xcite .    in order to take into account the perfect , fixed mirrors of the cavity",

    "the boundary conditions in ( [ bco ] ) come from applying the usual boundary conditions for electric fields at interfaces between different media @xcite .",
    "explicitly , they come from the following two requirements : ( i ) the electric field @xmath67 given in ( [ campos ] ) must vanish inside the perfect mirrors , and ( ii ) the component of the electric field tangent to the surface of each mirror must be continuous across the boundary of each mirror .    in the next sections we solve the boundary value problem ( [ 8])-([bco ] ) to good approximation .",

    "in this section we first describe briefly how the initial value problem in ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) can be solved by the method of multiple scales .",
    "the details are provided in appendix b for the case of two time - scales and in appendix c for the case of three time - scales .",
    "we treat the case of three time - scales in order to have an approximate solution that is accurate for very long times , while the case of two time - scales is presented because some of its results are used in the case of three time - scales . in the subsequent subsections we only present the results and discuss them .",
    "the method of multiple scales is applicable whenever there are several separate time - scales involved in a system , that is , when there are parts of a system that evolve much faster than others .",
    "the method consists in appropriately separating the parts of the system that evolve with the different time - scales and deducing the differential equations that govern the evolution of each part .",

    "separates the original differential equation for the harmonic oscillator into two differential equations , one for the fast oscillation and one for the slow decay of the amplitude . since  @xmath59  ( see item 1 in section iv ) , we have a similar situation in the system under consideration .",
    "the analogue of the fast oscillation of the harmonic oscillator is the evolution of the electromagnetic field with a fixed membrane , while the analogue of the slow decay of the amplitude is the dependence on the motion of the membrane . from (",
    "[ 12 ] ) it is clear that the slow time - scale in our system is given by @xmath138 since all of the coefficients of @xmath93 in ( [ 12 ] ) are functions of @xmath139 .",
    "the deduction of the fast time - scale is a bit more elaborate , but using the assumption that only mode @xmath101 is initially excited ( see item 2 in section iv ) , it can be shown ( see appendix b ) that it is given by @xmath140 d\\tau ' \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] physically this result is very reasonable as we now explain .",
