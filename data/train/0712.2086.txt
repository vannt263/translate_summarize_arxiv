    "in this letter we investigate homogeneous and steadily driven incompressible magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence . in practical applications , such as fusion devices , solar wind , and interstellar medium ,",
    "turbulence is driven by various large - scale instabilities , and turbulent energy is then spread over a broad range of spatial scales due to nonlinear interactions until small dissipative scales are reached where the energy is removed from the system . in the interval of scales between the injection and dissipation regions turbulence properties",
    "are thought to be universal  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mhd equations describing the evolution of magnetic and velocity fluctuations @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the presence of a guide field @xmath11 can be represented in the so - called elssser variables @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath15 is the fluid density , @xmath16 is the pressure that is determined from the incompressibility condition , @xmath17 , @xmath18 represents a large - scale forcing , and we omit the terms representing small viscosity and resistivity . the linear term on the left - hand side of equations  ( [ mhd1 ] ) , @xmath19 , is responsible for advection of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 wave packets , with the alfvn velocity along the guide field .",
    "the nonlinear term , @xmath22 , describes the interaction of turbulent fluctuations , and it is responsible for the energy transfer among different spatial scales . the nonlinear term is considered small if @xmath23 where @xmath1 and @xmath24 are typical field - parallel and field - perpendicular wavenumbers of the fluctuations spectrum , and @xmath3  ( @xmath25 ) is the typical magnitude of fluctuations at the scale  @xmath4 . this regime is referred to as `` weak turbulence . ''",
    "the regime when the nonlinear term in not formally small will be called `` strong turbulence . ''",
    "one can argue that in strong turbulence the following critical balance condition should be maintained at all scales  @xcite : @xmath26 indeed , during the characteristic time of nonlinear interaction , @xmath27 , the fluctuations become correlated along the guide field up to a distance @xmath28 .",
    "this causality condition ensures the critical balance  ( [ crit ] ) .",
    "depending on the way turbulence is excited , it satisfies either condition  ( [ weak - turb ] ) or  ( [ crit ] ) in a certain range of scales .",
    "recent numerical simulations and analytic modeling suggest that in the case of strong turbulence ( [ crit ] ) , the field - perpendicular energy spectrum is @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "however , geophysical and astrophysical observations often exhibit somewhat steeper spectra  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this raises the question of to what extent such systems can be described in the framework of mhd turbulence .    in the present work",
    "we conduct direct numerical simulations of reduced mhd equations , driven by a force with varying @xmath1  spectral width .",
    "this provides a unifying numerical setting allowing one to address the regimes of weak and strong turbulence in the same framework .",
    "we observe that when the critical balance  ( [ crit ] ) is satisfied , the spectrum of strong mhd turbulence is close to  @xmath30 .",
    "when the critical balance condition  ( [ crit ] ) is even slightly broken , the spectrum steepens .",
    "as the weak turbulence condition  ( [ weak - turb ] ) becomes better satisfied , the spectral exponent approaches  @xmath31 in accord with the theory of weak turbulence @xcite .",
    "the observed sensitivity of the spectrum to the forcing details may explain conflicting results of numerical and astrophysical observations , where the spectral properties of forcing are either not well controlled or not well known .    according to the standard derivation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the reduced mhd equations are valid in the region @xmath32 ; therefore , their applicability in the strong turbulence regime  ( [ crit ] ) is justified .",
    "their applicability in the weak turbulence regime  ( [ weak - turb ] ) , however , requires an explanation , which we provide in the following sections .",
    "when the condition  ( [ weak - turb ] ) is satisfied , one may assume that turbulence consists of shear - alfvn and pseudo - alfvn waves , weakly interacting with each other . in the absence of nonlinear interaction ,",
    "the waves would have random phases , and the gaussian rule could be applied to express their higher order correlation functions through the second - order ones .",
    "@xcite developed a perturbative theory of weak mhd turbulence based on such random phase approximation . by expanding the mhd eq .",
    "( [ mhd1 ] ) up to the second order in the nonlinear interaction and using the gaussian rule to split the fourth - order correlators , they derived a closed system of kinetic equations governing the wave energy spectra .    these equations demonstrate that wave energy cascades in the fourier space in the direction of large  @xmath24 , and the universal spectrum of wave turbulence is established in the region  @xmath33 . in this limit the dynamics of the shear - alfvn waves",
    "decouple from the dynamics of the pseudo - alfvn waves , and the pseudo - alfvn waves are passively scattered by the shear - alfvn ones .",
    "the kinetic equation for the energy spectrum of shear - alfvn waves , @xmath34 , derived by @xcite , then reads : @xmath35\\delta(q_\\| ) d_{\\bf k , pq } \\label{galtier - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , the interaction kernel is @xmath36 , and we adopt the shorthand notation @xmath37 .",
    "the phase - volume compensated energy spectrum is then calculated as  @xmath38 .",
    "the stationary solution of equation  ( [ galtier - eq ] ) was found analytically and verified numerically in @xcite .",
    "it has the general form  @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is an arbitrary function that is smooth at  @xmath41 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the derivation of  ( [ galtier - eq ] ) based on the weak interaction approximation is not rigorous . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ galtier - eq ] ) , only the @xmath42  components of the energy spectrum @xmath43 are responsible for the energy transfer .",
    "however , if we apply eq .",
    "( [ galtier - eq ] ) to these dynamically important components themselves , that is , if we set @xmath41 in ( [ galtier - eq ] ) , we observe an inconsistency . indeed",
    ", the perturbative approach implies that the linear frequencies of the waves are much larger than the frequency of their nonlinear interaction . the nonlinear interaction in  ( [ galtier - eq ] )",
    "remains nonzero as @xmath44 while the linear frequency of the corresponding alfvn modes , @xmath45 , vanishes .",
    "therefore , as shown by  @xcite , the additional assumption of smoothness of the function @xmath46 at @xmath47 is crucial for deriving the spectrum @xmath48 .",
    "a definitive numerical verification of such a spectrum seems therefore desirable .",
    "while numerical integration of a scattering model based on mhd equations expanded up to the second order in nonlinear interaction does reproduce the  @xmath31 exponent  @xcite , this spectrum has not yet been confirmed in direct numerical simulations of systems  ( [ mhd1 ] ) .",
    "the major problem faced by such simulations is to simultaneously satisfy the two conditions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which is hard to achieve with present - day computing power . in the next section",
    "we discuss a numerical setting in which the spectrum of weak turbulence can be verified .",
    "an important fact concerning eq .",
    "( [ galtier - eq ] ) was emphasized by  @xcite .",
    "they noted that there exists a dynamical system that leads to exactly the same kinetic equation  ( [ galtier - eq ] ) in the weak turbulence regime  ( [ weak - turb ] ) , _ without _ any additional restrictions on  @xmath24 and  @xmath1 . to derive this system",
    ", we note that in the universal regime where eq .",
    "( [ galtier - eq ] ) is applicable , the polarization vectors of the pseudo - alfvn modes are almost parallel to the guide field",
    ". one can therefore consider a system where such modes are eliminated for _ arbitrary _",
    "@xmath51 by restricting the initial mhd system to field - perpendicular fluctuations ,  @xmath52 : @xmath53 the fluctuating fields here have only two vector components , @xmath54 , but depend on all three spatial coordinates .",
    "although system  ( [ restricted ] ) is not presented in @xcite , their analysis of  ( [ mhd1 ] ) is equivalent to solving such a system .",
    "formally , system  ( [ restricted ] ) is equivalent to the reduced mhd equations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the principal difference is in the limits of validity : the reduced mhd model is applicable only for  @xmath33 , while we consider system  ( [ restricted ] ) without any restrictions .    within the formalism of the weak turbulence theory both systems ( [ mhd1 ] ) and  ( [ restricted ] ) lead to the same kinetic equation  ( [ galtier - eq ] ) for the shear - alfvn turbulence .",
    "we thus conclude that the wave energy spectrum obtained from the full mhd system  ( [ mhd1 ] ) under the assumption @xmath33 should coincide with the spectrum obtained from the restricted system  ( [ restricted ] ) , where the condition @xmath55 is not required . on the other hand ,",
    "strong turbulence is expected to develop when @xmath56 , which is precisely the domain in which reduced mhd provides a good approximation of the full mhd model .",
    "this opens an effective way for numerical investigation of both strong and weak mhd turbulence in the same framework , which is the goal of the present letter .",
    "we solve numerically the restricted mhd model  ( [ restricted ] ) using a fully dealiased pseudo - spectral technique in a periodic box that is elongated along the guide field @xmath57 with aspect ratio @xmath58 .",
    "the random force @xmath59 has no component along @xmath60 , it is solenoidal in the @xmath61 plane and its fourier coefficients outside the range @xmath62 , @xmath63 are zero , where integer @xmath64 determines the width of the force spectrum in @xmath65 .",
    "the fourier coefficients inside that range are gaussian random numbers with amplitude chosen so that the resulting rms velocity fluctuations are of order unity .",
    "the individual random values are refreshed independently at time intervals @xmath66 .",
    "the parameters  @xmath64 and @xmath67 control the degree to which condition  ( [ weak - turb ] ) or  ( [ crit ] ) is satisfied at the forcing scale .",
    "note that we do _ not _ drive the @xmath68  modes but allow them to be generated by nonlinear interactions .",
    "the reynolds number is defined as @xmath69 , where @xmath70  @xmath71 is the field - perpendicular box size , @xmath72 is fluid viscosity , and @xmath73  @xmath74 is the rms value of velocity fluctuations . in our case magnetic resistivity and fluid viscosity",
    "are the same , @xmath75 .",
    "the system is evolved until a stationary state is reached , as determined by the time evolution of the total energy of the fluctuations .",
    "a typical run produces from 30 to 60 snapshots .",
    "the field - perpendicular energy spectrum is obtained by averaging the angle - integrated fourier spectrum , @xmath76 , over field - perpendicular planes in all snapshots .     of mhd turbulence , calculated by direct numerical integration of  ( [ restricted ] ) .",
    "the presented cases correspond , from bottom to top , to @xmath77 .",
    "for clarity , the curves in the top panel are arbitrarily offset in the vertical direction.,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    we performed a series of simulations for @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we used the resolution @xmath81 mesh points in these simulations ( and @xmath82 ) , except for the case @xmath83 , where the resolution was @xmath84 ( and @xmath85 ) .",
    "we also performed a simulation with @xmath78 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 and the resolution @xmath84 ( and @xmath85 ) .",
    "[ spectrum ] shows the field - perpendicular energy spectra for each run .",
    "all the runs have different values of parameter @xmath88 that measures deviation from the critical balance  ( [ crit ] ) condition .",
    "( bottom ) , @xmath89  ( center ) , and @xmath90  ( top ) .",
    "the colors represent energy in a log scale , normalized to the energy of the most dominant large - scale mode . ]",
    "we found that as the spectral width of the forcing along @xmath65 increases , higher and higher frequency modes of the velocity and magnetic fields are excited .",
    "for run @xmath91 , all the forced modes have linear frequency @xmath92 , which corresponds to a critically balanced forcing . in this case , the spectrum is @xmath93 .",
    "this result is consistent with recent numerical simulation of full mhd by  @xcite , since the reduced mhd system approximates the full mhd system when the critical balance condition is satisfied .",
    "as we increase the parameter  @xmath94 , we break the critical balance condition at the forcing scales . as a result",
    ", the spectrum monotonically steepens from @xmath30 in the strong turbulence case to @xmath31 in the weak turbulence case , as shown in fig",
    ".  [ spectrum ] .    fig .",
    "[ spectrum2d ] shows isocontours of the full energy spectrum @xmath95 as a function of  @xmath2 and  @xmath65 for the three typical cases @xmath96 .",
    "the bottom frame presents the energy distribution for the case @xmath91 , where the random force preserves the critical balance .",
    "as the cascade continues deeper into the inertial range , higher frequency modes  @xmath97 are generated by virtue of nonlinear interactions , just enough to maintain the critical balance condition at all scales , and establish a strong turbulence spectrum . as the frequency of the forced alfvn modes increases in the cases",
    "@xmath98 , the parallel cascade is slightly inhibited as the weaker interaction among the large scale alfvn modes dominates the energy transfer to smaller scales , resulting in a steepening of the field - perpendicular energy spectrum .",
    "this can be seen in the middle and top frames in fig .",
    "[ spectrum2d ] , where the distribution of energy becomes more and more elongated along @xmath2 rather than @xmath65 .",
    "our numerical results demonstrate that if the energy spectrum has a limited extent , increasing the  @xmath65 width of the forcing spectrum leads to the energy spectrum of weak turbulence  @xmath99 .",
    "if however the @xmath65 width of the forcing is limited , but we can achieve arbitrarily high resolution in the @xmath2 direction , the interaction between alfvn modes will eventually become strong enough to satisfy critical balance and establish a strong turbulence spectrum .",
    "this is partly supported by the following derivation .",
    "it can be proved that turbulent fluctuations described by system  ( [ restricted ] ) satisfy the exact relation : @xmath100 where @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is the longitudinal component of @xmath103 .",
    "averaging is taken over the statistical ensemble , or over time and spatial position  * x*. in this formula , @xmath104 are the constant rates of  @xmath105 and  @xmath106 energy dissipation . in the isotropic case , that is , without the guide field , the relation analogous to  ( [ pp - restricted ] ) was derived by  @xcite .",
    "we now prove the following general inequality : @xmath107 the first step is to use the schwartz inequality , @xmath108 ; the second step is to note that  @xmath109 , which completes the proof .",
    "both sides in the expression  ( [ mhd - inequality - restricted ] ) have finite limits as viscosity and resistivity go to zero . in the inertial interval ,",
    "the correlation functions on the right - hand side of this expression have a power - law behavior , that is , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( we assume statistical symmetry between @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) .",
    "since the left hand side of ( [ mhd - inequality - restricted ] ) scales as @xmath114 , and the inequality should hold for arbitrarily small  @xmath115 , we obtain the exact result @xmath116    this inequality is useful for evaluation of these exponents from numerical simulations or experiments since the _ ratio _ of these exponents is well measured by the method of extended self - similarity  @xcite .",
    "the inequality  ( [ bound - mhd ] ) then provides a boundary on the turbulence energy spectrum that is related to the second - order scaling exponent as @xmath117 in our case , the scaling exponent @xmath118 is usually close to @xmath119 within small intermittency corrections , which can be checked numerically  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "inequality  ( [ bound - mhd ] ) then implies that @xmath120 , and , therefore , the field - perpendicular energy spectrum can not be essentially steeper than @xmath121 in the limit  @xmath122 .",
    "note , however , that in our numerical findings the spectral exponent  @xmath123 is not distinguished in any way ; rather , the field - perpendicular energy spectrum of strong mhd turbulence is flatter and closer to  @xmath30 .",
    "this is consistent with recent results of  @xcite and also with high - resolution simulations of isotropic mhd turbulence by  @xcite .",
    "astrophysical observations of the solar wind and of the interstellar medium reveal the presence of mhd turbulence , and find support for both @xmath123 and @xmath30 spectral exponents  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , statistics of such data are often not good enough to distinguish between `` @xmath123 '' and `` @xmath30 '' with confidence . on the numerical side ,",
    "simulations of mhd turbulence in the framework of reduced mhd were performed in many works  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , either the simulation domain was not anisotropic to ensure the critical balance condition  ( [ crit ] ) , or the driving force was not spatially homogeneous , for example , applied at the boundary of the domain .",
    "our results suggest that the interpretation of observational and numerical results may be obscured if the @xmath65 and @xmath24 structure of the spectrum is either not well measured or not well controlled , in which case it is hard to deduce whether the field - parallel dynamics have been captured and whether the universal regime of mhd turbulence has been established .    this work was supported by the us department of energy under grant de - fg02 - 07er54932 , and by the nsf center for magnetic self - organization in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas at the university of wisconsin - madison .",
