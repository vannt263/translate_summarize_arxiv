    "in @xcite , fomin and kirillov introduced a new class of quadratic algebras @xmath13 , as an attempt to give a combinatorial explanation of the fact that , with respect to the linear basis on the cohomology ring of a flag manifold consisting of all schubert cells , the constant structures are non - negative .",
    "fomin - kirillov algebras have many intersting properties .",
    "for example , they are strongly related to nichols algebras .",
    "let us recall that , by definition , a nichols algebra is an @xmath14-graded bialgebra in the category of yetter - drinfeld @xmath15-modules , which is connected and generated by @xmath16-degree elements . here",
    "@xmath15 may be any hopf algebra over a field @xmath17 , but in this paper we are interested in the case when @xmath15 is the group algebra @xmath18 of a finite group @xmath19 .",
    "nichols algebras over abelian groups play a fundamental role in the classification of finite dimensional pointed hopf algebras with commutative coradical , cf . @xcite and the references therein .",
    "they have also been used as a very important tool for the investigation of certain quantum groups . for a non - abelian group @xmath19 , the structure of nichols",
    "algebras over @xmath18 is not so well understood , but nowadays this is a very dynamic research area , see @xcite .",
    "one of the main difficulties in the non - commutative setting is that only few finite dimensional nichols algebras are known .    turning back to fomin - kirillov algebras ,",
    "it was proved in @xcite that @xmath20 is a graded bialgebra in the category of yetter - drinfeld @xmath21-modules , and it is a nichols algebra for @xmath22 .",
    "a similar result was obtained for @xmath23 in @xcite .",
    "based on these results , milinski and schneider have conjectured that @xmath20 is a nichols algebra too , for all other values of @xmath24 .",
    "see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 9.3 ) .",
    "notably , for @xmath25 , it was proved that @xmath26 and it was conjectured that @xmath27 , provided that @xmath28 .",
    "the theory of support and rank variety for hopf algebras is the driving force behind the results concerning the finite generation of the cohomology ring of these and other related structures .",
    "rather recently , the famous result due to golod , venkov and evans @xcite , stating that the cohomology ring of a finite group is finitely generated , has been extended for several classes of hopf algebras , including the finite dimensional cocommutative hopf algebras @xcite , the finite dimensional pointed hopf algebras with abelian coradical of dimension relatively prime to @xmath29 and the corresponding nichols algebras @xcite , small quantum groups @xcite and finite quantum function algebras @xcite .    according to our best knowledge , analogous results are not known for pointed hopf algebras over non - abelian groups , excepting the case when the corresponding nichols algebras are of diagonal type , as in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , using the ` gap ` package ` qpa ` the dimension of @xmath30 was computed for @xmath24 up to @xmath31 , the outcome suggesting that the hilbert series of the cohomology ring @xmath32 is @xmath33 and that @xmath32 is generated by three cohomology classes of degree @xmath16 and one of degree @xmath34 , see @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to clarify the ring structure of @xmath32 and , in particular , to confirm the computer calculations that we mentioned above . roughly speaking , in our main result , theorem [ te : main ]",
    ", we prove that @xmath32 is a polynomial ring @xmath10 $ ] over the braided symmetric algebra @xmath35 of the yetter - drinfeld @xmath36-module @xmath7 that help us to regard @xmath1 as a nichols algebra @xmath37 .",
    "the key steps of the proof of theorem [ te : main ] are the following .",
    "first we notice that , by @xcite , the algebra @xmath1 is a twisted tensor product @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are presented by generators and relations as follows : @xmath41 and @xmath42 , see  [ subsec : b is a twist ] .",
    "this property allows us to use a version of cartan - eilenberg spectral sequence , that we construct for any graded twisting product @xmath43 with invertible twisting map @xmath44 that satisfying an extra mild condition . by definition ,",
    "its second page is given by @xmath45 and it converges to @xmath46 , cf .",
    "theorem [ te : ce ] and corollary [ co : ce ] . in order to use this spectral sequence",
    ", we have to explicit the ring structure of the cohomology ring @xmath47 and the @xmath40-action on @xmath47 . in the special case of the fomin - kirillov algebra @xmath48 ,",
    "this is done in the third section , see theorem [ thm : ea algebra structure ] and theorem [ thm : r action ] .",
    "as an important step , we find lower and upper bounds for the dimension of @xmath49 . to be more specific , by proposition [ prop : la b embeds into eb ] the subalgebra generated by @xmath50 is precisely @xmath51 , the braided symmetric algebra of the yetter - drinfeld module @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the dimension of @xmath49 is at least the dimension of @xmath52 . on the other hand , using a basic property of spectral sequences , we deduce that the dimension of @xmath49 is at most @xmath53 . for @xmath54",
    "the lower and the upper bounds of @xmath55 coincide and @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , there is a @xmath34-cohomology class which is a central element and does not belong to @xmath57 .",
    "all these results imply that our spectral sequence degenerates and @xmath55 reaches the upper bound , see theorem [ thm : dime^n ] .    to give a presentation of @xmath32 by generators and relations we use that the cohomology ring of a nichols algebra is braided commutative ( * ?",
    "* corollary 3.13 ) . taking into account this result and the fact that @xmath32 is generated by elements of degree at most @xmath34 ( see proposition [ prop : generatorsyoneda ] ) we are able to prove that @xmath32 is a quotient graded algebra of @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "we conclude the proof of our main result by showing that the homogeneous components of @xmath32 and @xmath10 $ ] are equidimensional .    as an application of our main result we also compute the cohomology ring of the bosonization @xmath11 . by definition ,",
    "the bosonization of @xmath1 is the ordinary hopf algebra whose underlying vector space is @xmath58 with the algebra and coalgebra structures given by the smash product and smash coproduct , respectively .",
    "our computation is a consequence of the fact that @xmath59 is the invariant ring of a canonical @xmath8-action on @xmath32 .",
    "more precisely , in theorem [ te : bos ] we show that @xmath59 is the quotient of the polynomial ring @xmath60 $ ] by the principal ideal @xmath61 .",
    "a similar computation is performed in theorem [ te : bos 1 ] for the dual hopf algebra of @xmath11 , which is also a bosonization of @xmath1 , regarded as a bialgebra in the category of yetter - drinfeld modules over the dual of @xmath36 .",
