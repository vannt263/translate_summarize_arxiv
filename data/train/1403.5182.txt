    "in recent years , various attempts are being made in the laboratory to implement quantum gates , which are basic building blocks of a quantum computer .",
    "performance of a quantum computer is determined by how fast one can apply these logic gates so as to drive the initial state to a final state .",
    "then , the natural question that arises is : can a quantum state evolve arbitrarily fast ?",
    "it turns out that quantum mechanics limits the evolution speed of any quantum system . in quantum information ,",
    "study of these limits has found several applications over the years . some of these include , but not limited , to quantum metrology , quantum chemical dynamics , quantum control and quantum computation .",
    "extensive amount of work has already been done on the subject ",
    "minimum time required to reach a target state \" since the appearance of first major result by mandelstam and tamm @xcite .",
    "however , the notion of quantum speed or speed of transportation of quantum state was first introduced by anandan - aharonov using the fubini - study metric @xcite and subsequently , the same notion was defined in ref .",
    "@xcite using the riemannian metric @xcite .",
    "it was found that the speed of a quantum state on the projective hilbert space is proportional to the fluctuation in the hamiltonian of the system . using the concept of fubini - study metric on the projective hilbert space , a geometric meaning",
    "is given to the probabilities of a two - state system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the quantum speed is directly related to the super current in the josephson junction @xcite . in the last two decades",
    ", there have been various attempts made in understanding the geometric aspects of quantum evolution for pure as well for mixed states @xcite . the quantum speed limit ( qsl ) for the driven @xcite and the non - markovian @xcite quantum systems",
    "is introduced using the notion of bures metric @xcite .",
    "very recently , qsl for physical processes was defined by taddei _",
    "@xcite using the bures metric and in the case of open quantum system the same is introduced by campo _",
    "@xcite using the notion of relative purity @xcite . in an interesting twist",
    ", it has been shown that qsl for multipartite system is bounded by the generalized geometric measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that very recently , an experiment was reported @xcite , which is the only experiment performed , where only a consequence of the qsl had been tested and any experimental test of the speed limit itself is still lacking . in this paper , we introduce a new operation dependent metric , which can be measured experimentally in the interference of mixed states .",
    "we show that using this metric , it is possible to define a new lower limit for the evolution time of any system described by mixed state undergoing unitary evolution .",
    "we derive the qsl using the geometric uncertainty relation based on this new metric .",
    "we also obtain a margolus - levitin ( ml ) bound and an improved chau bound for mixed states using our approach .",
    "we show that this bound for the evolution time of a quantum system is tighter than any other existing bounds for unitary evolutions .",
    "most importantly , we propose an experiment to measure this new distance in the interference of mixed states .",
    "we argue that the visibility in quantum interference is a direct measure of distance for mixed quantum states .",
    "finally , we generalize the speed limit for the case of completely positive trace preserving evolutions and get a new lower bound for the evolution time using this metric .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the metric for the density operator along unitary path",
    ". then , we use this metric to obtain new and tighter time bounds for unitary evolutions in section iii , followed by examples in section iv . in section",
    "v , we show that bounds are experimentally measurable .",
    "section vi is for generalization of the metric and the time bounds for completely positive trace preserving(cptp ) maps followed by an example .",
    "then , we conclude in section vii .",
    "let @xmath0 denotes a finite - dimensional hilbert space and @xmath1 is the set of linear operators on @xmath0 . a density operator @xmath2 is a hermitian , positive and trace class operator that satisfies @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "it evolves under a unitary evolution and at time @xmath10 , the state becomes @xmath11 .",
    "any two density operators that are connected by a unitary transformation will give a unitary orbit .",
    "if @xmath12 denotes the set of @xmath13 unitary matrices on @xmath14 , then for a given density operator @xmath2 , the unitary orbit is defined by @xmath15 . the most important notion that has resulted from the study of interference of mixed quantum states is the concept of the relative phase between @xmath9 and @xmath16 and the notion of visibility in the interference pattern .",

    "the quantity @xmath22 $ ] represents the probability amplitude between @xmath9 and @xmath16 , which are unitarily connected .",
    "therefore , for the unitary orbit @xmath23 represents the transition probability between @xmath9 and @xmath16 .",
    "all the existing metrics on the quantum state space give rise to the distance between two states independent of the operation . here , we define a new distance between two unitarily connected states of a quantum system . this distance not only depends on the states but also depends on the operation under which the evolution occurs . whether a state of a system will evolve to another state depends on the hamiltonian which in turn fixes the unitary orbit",

    "in particular , we have @xmath51 and @xmath52 are two unitarily connected mixed states of a quantum system @xmath28 .",

    "this evolution is equivalent to a unitary evolution of @xmath239 as @xmath240 in the extended hilbert space .",
    "the unitary evolution is implemented by a hamiltonian @xmath241 this is a canonical two qubit hamiltonian up to local unitary operators . with the unitary @xmath197=@xmath242",
    ", we have the kraus operators @xmath243=@xmath244 and @xmath245=@xmath246 and it is now easy to show from eq .",

    "quantum interference plays a very important role in testing new ideas in quantum theory .",
    "motivated by interferometric set up for measuring the relative phase and the visibility for the pure state , we have proposed a new and novel measure of distance for the mixed states , which are connected by the unitary orbit .",
    "the new metric reduces to the fubini - study metric for pure state . using this metric ,",
    "we have derived a geometric uncertainty relation for mixed state , which sets a qsl for arbitrary unitary evolution .",
    "in addition , an ml bound and an improved chau bound is derived using our formalism .",
    "these new speed limits based on our formalism are tighter than any other existing bounds .",
    "since , the design of the target state is a daunting task in quantum control , our formalism will help in deciding which operation can evolve the initial state to the final state faster . recently ,",
    "an experiment was reported , which is the only experiment , where only a consequence of the qsl was tested and any experimental test of the qsl itself is still lacking . here , we have proposed an experiment to measure this new distance and quantum speed in the interference of mixed states .",
    "the visibility of the quantum interference pattern is a direct measure of distance between two mixed states of the quantum system along the unitary orbit .",
    "we have shown that by appropriately choosing different unitaries in the upper and lower arm of the interferometer one can measure the quantum speed and the bargmann angle .",
    "this provides us a new way to measure the quantum speed and quantum distance in quantum interferometry .",
    "we furthermore , extended the idea of speed limit for the case of density operators undergoing completely positive trace preserving maps .",
    "we hope that our proposed metric will lead to direct test of qsl in quantum interferometry .",
    "our formalism can have implications in quantum metrology @xcite , precision measurement of the gravitational red shift @xcite and gravitationally induced decoherence @xcite with mixed states and other areas of quantum information science .",
    "* note : * recently , a number of papers have appeared on qsl relating it with the quantum coherence or asymmetry @xcite , leakage and decoherence @xcite , generation of non - classicality @xcite and also with the quantum fisher information @xcite .",
