    "in this paper we re - examine the following problem .",
    "let @xmath0 be three distinct points in the plane , and , for @xmath1 , let @xmath2 be a family of @xmath3 unit circles that pass through @xmath4 .",
    "the goal is to obtain an upper bound on the number of _ triple points _ , which are points that are incident to a circle of each family .",
    "see figures [ triples ] and [ setups](a ) for an illustration .",
    "recently , elekes et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the number of such points is @xmath6 , for some constant parameter @xmath7 ( that they did not make concrete ) ; by this they settled a conjecture of szkely ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 3.41 ) ) , stipulating that this number should be @xmath8 .    using a different technique , which appears to be simpler than the one in  @xcite , we improve",
    "the earlier bound , showing that the number of triple points is @xmath5 .",
    "the specific problem studied in this paper can be viewed as a special instance of a more general setup , which has been studied by elekes and rnyai  @xcite and by elekes and szab  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . from a high - level point of view",
    "the setup is as follows .",
    "we have three sets @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , each of @xmath3 real numbers , and we have a trivariate real polynomial @xmath12 of some constant degree @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the subset of @xmath15 where @xmath12 vanishes .",
    "the goal is to show that , unless @xmath12 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 have some very special structure , @xmath16 is subquadratic .",
    "( for a simple example where @xmath16 is quadratic in @xmath3 , consider the case where @xmath17 , and where @xmath18 . )",
    "positive and significant results for this general problem have been obtained by elekes and rnyai  @xcite and by elekes and szab  @xcite , who showed that , unless @xmath12 has a very restricted form , @xmath16 is indeed subquadratic in @xmath3 .",
    "for example , in the case where @xmath12 is of the form @xmath19 , if @xmath16 is quadratic in @xmath3 , then @xmath20 must be of one of the forms @xmath21 or @xmath22 , for suitable univariate polynomials @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we have recently studied in @xcite this specific problem ( where @xmath26 ) and obtained improved bounds for @xmath16 , when @xmath20 does not have these special forms ; see below .",
    "related representations , somewhat more complicated to state , for a polynomial @xmath12 with @xmath27 , have also been obtained for the general case ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .    the high - level approach used in this",
    "paper is similar to those used in several recent works that study problems in combinatorial geometry that are special instances of this general framework ( see sharir , sheffer , and solymosi  @xcite and sharir and solymosi  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the actual implementations of this approach in our paper , as well as in the other works just mentioned , are very problem - specific and exploit the special geometric structure of the relevant problem .",
    "we will later detail the connection of our problem to the setup in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , for each @xmath2 , its circles have one degree of freedom , and we parameterize them by a suitable single real parameter . then , with a proper choice of these parameters , the condition that three circles , one from each family , have a common point can be expressed by an equation of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath12 is a real trivariate polynomial , and @xmath29 are the parameters representing the three relevant circles .     and",
    "@xmath30.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in both cases , the specific problem studied in this paper ( and the specific problems studied in @xcite ) , and the general one in @xcite , the approach is to double count the number @xmath31 of quadruples @xmath32 , such that , in our specific context , @xmath33 represent two circles in @xmath34 , @xmath35 represent two circles in @xmath36 , and there exists @xmath37 , representing a circle through @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "( in the general case , the quadruples to be considered are @xmath32 such that @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and there exists @xmath43 such that @xmath44 . ) a lower bound for @xmath31 , in terms of @xmath45 , is easy to obtain ( see below for details ) , and an upper bound is obtained by regarding each such quadruple @xmath32 as an _ incidence _ between the point @xmath46 , in a suitable parametric plane , and a curve @xmath47 which is the locus of all points @xmath46 that satisfy with @xmath33 the above conditions .",
    "the comparison between the lower and upper bounds yields the asserted upper bound on @xmath16 .    the main issue that arises in bounding the number of incidences is the possibility that many curves @xmath47 overlap each other , in which case the standard techniques for analyzing point - curve incidences fail . a major part of the analysis in this paper is to show that the amount of overlap is bounded .",
    "in this case the standard incidence techniques do apply , and yield a sharp upper bound that leads to the aforementioned bound on @xmath16 ; see below for details .    in the general problem ,",
    "the goal is to show that when there is a larger amount of overlap between the curves , the polynomial @xmath12 must have a special form , as the ones mentioned above and established in @xcite , and to establish a subquadratic upper bound on @xmath16 when this is not the case .",
    "as mentioned , this indeed has recently been shown in a companion paper @xcite for the special case where @xmath26 , for any constant - degree bivariate polynomial @xmath20 , with the same subquadratic bound @xmath5 as the one established in this paper .",
    "this argument has not yet been worked out for the case of a general trivariate polynomial @xmath12 , except for the general ( and weaker . ] ) analysis in @xcite . in our problem , though , this part is not needed , and the argument that the overlap is bounded is an ad - hoc argument that exploits the geometric and algebraic structure of the problem .",
    "we begin by observing the following equivalent and , in our opinion , more convenient formulation of the problem .",
    "let @xmath48 be three unit circles in @xmath49 , and , for each @xmath1 , let @xmath50 be a set of @xmath3 points lying on @xmath51 .",
    "the goal is to obtain a subquadratic upper bound on the number of unit circles , spanned by triples of points in @xmath52 .",
    "( the equivalence between this formulation and the one in  @xcite , as stated in the introduction , is indeed trivial : for each @xmath53 , @xmath50 is the set of centers of the circles of @xmath2 , and the centers of the resulting `` trichromatic '' unit circles in the new formulation are the triple points in the previous one . )",
    "see figures  [ setups](a ) and [ setups](b ) for an illustration of this connection between the two setups . in what follows we use the new formulation .",
    "we note that the condition that three points @xmath54 span a unit circle can be expressed as a polynomial equation in their coordinates .",
    "that is , there exists a 6-variate real polynomial @xmath12 of degree 6 , such that @xmath55 when @xmath56 span a unit circle .",
    "we delegate the explicit construction of @xmath12 , which we believe might be of some interest , to appendix  [ app : f ] , and remark that our analysis will not make use of the explicit form of @xmath12 .    for each @xmath1",
    ", each point @xmath57 can be parameterized by ( an appropriate algebraic representation of ) the orientation @xmath58 of @xmath23 with respect to the center @xmath59 of @xmath51 ( note that the centers @xmath59 are the points @xmath4 in the original formulation ) ; denote the set of these @xmath3 orientations as @xmath60 . in what follows",
    "we will interchangeably use both notations , referring to a point @xmath57 , for @xmath1 , either by its corresponding parameter @xmath61 , when we want to stress the algebraic nature of the problem , or as @xmath23 itself , when geometry is concerned .",
    "we call a triple @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , @xmath1 , a _ unit triple _ if the three corresponding points @xmath64 span a unit circle .",
    "we use the standard algebraic representation of the @xmath65 s , where we replace @xmath65 by @xmath66 , and the corresponding point on @xmath51 then becomes @xmath67 . with these representations ,",
    "the property of being a unit triple can be expressed by a polynomial equation @xmath68 , obtained by the appropriate substitutions into the equation of @xmath12 ( see ( [ ucirpoly ] ) in appendix  [ app : f ] ) . clearly , @xmath20 has constant ( and small ) degree .",
    "this illustrates how our problem is indeed a special instance of the general problem mentioned in the introduction .",
    "in what follows we will refer to the @xmath65 s as orientations , also when substituting them in @xmath20 ( the actual substitution should be of the corresponding parameters @xmath69 ) .",
    "this slightly incorrect treatment is made to simplify the presentation , and has no real consequences in the analysis .",
    "we next argue that , without loss of generality ( with a possible re - indexing of the input circles and points ) , we may assume that the points of @xmath70 all lie in the portion of @xmath71 that lies outside the closed disk circumscribed by @xmath72 ( this property will become handy for the forthcoming analysis ) . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath73 denote the three ( closed ) unit disks circumscribed by @xmath74 , respectively , and consider the intersection region @xmath75 .",
    "assume first that @xmath76 has a nonempty interior .",
    "as is well known , the boundary @xmath77 of @xmath76 is of the form @xmath78 , where @xmath59 is a single ( possibly empty ) connected arc of @xmath51 , for @xmath1 .",
    "more generally , in the intersection @xmath76 of any finite number of unit disks , each disk contributes at most one connected arc to @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a unit circle in the plane , which is not one of @xmath74 , and let @xmath79 denote the disk bounded by @xmath11 .",
    "then , as just mentioned , @xmath11 contributes a single connected arc @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "it follows that @xmath11 avoids the relative interior of at least one of the arcs @xmath82 , namely the arc not containing any endpoint of @xmath80 .",
    "( if one of those arcs is empty , @xmath11 trivially misses that arc . )",
    "it follows that , for every triple @xmath83 spanning a unit circle @xmath11 , at least one of the points @xmath0 avoids @xmath76 , because neither of these points can lie in the interior of @xmath76 , and they lie on @xmath11 , which meets @xmath77 in at most two points .",
    "so , for one of the indices @xmath84 , and for at least a third of these triples @xmath85 , the point @xmath86 avoids @xmath76 ; without loss of generality assume @xmath87 . by discarding the other points of @xmath70",
    ", we obtain a reduced configuration in which the points of @xmath70 lie outside @xmath76 and the number of unit triples is at least one third of its original value .",
    "that is , each point in ( the reduced ) @xmath70 lies either outside @xmath88 or outside @xmath89 .",
    "one of these subsets of @xmath70 participates in at least half the ( remaining ) unit triples . to recap , by removing the points of the other subset , and by re - indexing",
    "if needed , we may assume that all the points of @xmath70 lie outside the disk @xmath88 , and that the number of unit triples is at least one sixth of the original number .",
    "this reasoning also applies when @xmath76 is empty or is a singleton ( with an empty interior ) , and in fact becomes much simpler in these cases .",
    "we therefore continue the analysis under the assumption that the points of @xmath70 all lie outside @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath90 denote the number of unit circles spanned by @xmath52 .",
    "our strategy is to double count the quantity @xmath31 ( mentioned in the introduction ) that we are now going to define . for each @xmath91 ,",
    "let @xmath92 denote the set of pairs @xmath93 such that @xmath62 is a unit triple , so @xmath68 .",
    "note that we have @xmath94 .",
    "indeed , there are at most eight triples in @xmath52 that span the same unit circle @xmath11 ( @xmath11 intersects each of @xmath74 in at most two points , and each triple of points , one from each pair , spans @xmath11 ) , and clearly , by definition , at least one of these triples is counted in @xmath90 .",
    "we now define @xmath95 the quantity @xmath31 may be interpreted as the number of ordered pairs of unit triples of the form @xmath96 , with a common third component @xmath97 . using the cauchy - schwarz inequality , we have @xmath98    [ [ the - curves - gamma_ab . ] ] the curves @xmath47 .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to obtain an upper bound for @xmath31 , we use the following approach . fix two points @xmath99 , with orientations @xmath100 , respectively , and define @xmath47 to be the algebraic curve given by the polynomial equation @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the _ resultant _ of the two polynomials @xmath103 , @xmath104 with respect to @xmath97 ( which is thus a real bivariate polynomial in @xmath105 , independent of @xmath97 ) . by the properties of the resultant , the curve @xmath47 contains all points @xmath106 , with corresponding points @xmath107 , for which there exists @xmath97 ( not necessarily in @xmath108 ) such that @xmath109 for more details see , e.g. , cox et al .",
    "however , it might contain points @xmath106 where there is no real point @xmath110 that spans unit circles with both pairs @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "in general , the curve @xmath113 is partitioned into a constant number of connected arcs of two kinds : _ real _ arcs , over which ( [ eqgam ] ) has a real solution @xmath97 , and _ non - real _ arcs , over which there are no such real solutions .",
    "we refer to the endpoints of these arcs as _ transition points_. we will analyze and handle these points later on .. only @xmath37 can assume non - real values for points on non - real arcs .",
    "in other words , ignoring its geometric interpretation , @xmath47 is a real curve . ]",
    "let @xmath114 denote the set @xmath115 , represented as a set of points in the above parametric plane , let @xmath116 denote the ( multi-)set of the curves @xmath47 , and let @xmath117 denote the number of incidences between the curves of @xmath116 and the points of @xmath114 .",
    "note that , for any fixed @xmath91 and for any ordered pair of pairs @xmath118 , @xmath119 in @xmath92 , we have @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it follows that the number @xmath122 of point - curve incidences is at least @xmath123 .",
    "indeed , there can be at most four values of @xmath97 that give rise to the same incidence ( any of the pairs @xmath124 , say @xmath118 , defines at most two unit circles that pass through the two corresponding points , and each of these circles can intersect @xmath125 in at most two points ) , and only those values among them that belong to @xmath108 are reflected in the above sum ; also , the fact that each pair of pairs in @xmath92 generate two incidences is `` neutralized '' by the fact that the same two incidences are generated for each of the two orderings of the pairs .",
    "that is , we have @xmath126 , so it suffices to obtain an upper bound for @xmath122 .",
    "the number of incidences between curves of @xmath116 that are of the form @xmath127 , with @xmath128 , and the points of @xmath114 , is @xmath129 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath128 and consider the curve @xmath127 . for @xmath130 , there exist at most two unit circles that pass through @xmath131 and @xmath80 , and these circles form at most four intersection points @xmath37 with @xmath125 .",
    "then for each such intersection point @xmath37 , there exist at most two unit circles that pass through @xmath131 and @xmath37 , which form at most four intersection points @xmath13 with @xmath72 .",
    "thus there are at most 16 values @xmath13 for which @xmath132 .",
    "it follows that , for each @xmath128 , the curve @xmath127 is incident to @xmath133 points of @xmath114 , and hence the total number of incidences that curves of this form contribute is @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , letting @xmath134 be the ( multi-)set of the curves @xmath47 , with @xmath135 , and letting @xmath136 denote the number of incidences between the curves of @xmath137 and the points of @xmath114 , we get @xmath138 , and thus @xmath139 .",
    "we reiterate that @xmath140 ( and @xmath122 ) might include many irrelevant incidences , first , because the corresponding parameter @xmath97 does not belong to @xmath108 , and second , because @xmath97 is not real ( the incidence occurs on a non - real arc of the relevant curve @xmath47 ) . still , an upper bound on the ( overestimate ) @xmath140 suffices for our purpose .",
    "hence the problem is reduced to obtaining an upper bound on @xmath140 .",
    "this is an instance of a fairly standard point - curve incidence problem , which can be tackled using the well established machinery , such as the incidence bound of pach and sharir  @xcite , or , more fundamentally , the crossing - lemma technique of szkely  @xcite ( on which the analysis in @xcite is based ) .",
    "however , to apply this machinery , it is essential that the curves of @xmath137 have a constant bound on their multiplicity .",
    "more precisely , we need to know that no more than @xmath141 curves of @xmath137 can share a common irreducible component . in more detail , while the points of @xmath114 are clearly distinct , there might be potentially many pairs of curves of @xmath137 that coincide or overlap in a common irreducible component , in which case the aforementioned incidence - bounding techniques break down .",
    "fortunately , this can be controlled through the following key proposition .",
    "( recall that this arises as a key issue when applying this approach to the general setup of elekes and rnyai  @xcite , as manifested in the companion paper @xcite , and it will certainly also be a key issue in further attempts to tackle the more general setup of elekes and szab  @xcite in a similar manner . )    [ pr : ov ] there exists a set @xmath142 of @xmath133 pairs @xmath143 , such that , for any irreducible component @xmath144 , there are at most @xmath141 pairs @xmath143 such that @xmath144 contains a portion of a real arc of @xmath47 , and @xmath145 .",
    "the proof of the proposition is given in section  [ se : ov ] .",
    "this allows us to derive an upper bound on the number of incidences , given in the following proposition .",
    "[ prop : incid ] let @xmath137 and @xmath114 be as above .",
    "then the number @xmath140 of incidences between @xmath137 and @xmath114 is @xmath146 .",
    "the proof of the proposition is given in section  [ se : incid ] . since @xmath147",
    ", it follows that in this case @xmath148 and thus , recalling that @xmath149 , @xmath150 too , so we get @xmath151 .",
    "we thus obtain the following main result of the paper , returning to the original formulation of the problem .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath0 be three distinct points in the plane , and , for @xmath1 , let @xmath2 be a family of @xmath3 unit circles that pass through @xmath4 .",
    "then the number of points incident to a circle of each family is @xmath5 .      in this section",
    "we provide a detailed analysis of the structure and properties of the curves @xmath47 , from both algebraic and geometric perspectives .",

    "note that @xmath334 , having degree @xmath13 , has at most @xmath13 irreducible components , and thus , by the pigeonhole principle , there exists an irreducible component @xmath337 of @xmath334 that is shared by at least @xmath311 curves @xmath335 ; by reindexing , if needed , assume these are @xmath335 , @xmath338 .",
    "let @xmath339 be the multiplicity bound obtained in proposition  [ pr : ov ] .",

    "we have @xmath344 , or , by duality , @xmath345 , for every @xmath346 .",
    "similarly , we also have @xmath347 and so @xmath348 , for @xmath349 . using bzout s theorem once again ,",
    "we have that @xmath350 and @xmath351 , which intersect in at least @xmath332 points , share a common irreducible component , for each @xmath352 .",
    "since @xmath350 is of degree @xmath13 , and thus has at most @xmath13 irreducible components , we conclude that there exists an irreducible component of @xmath350 that is shared by @xmath353 other curves @xmath351 .",

    "we skip over at most @xmath326 points in the process , but now , having applied this `` stretching '' to each pair of bad neighbors , each of the modified edges has multiplicity at most @xmath354 ( the factor 2 comes from the fact that a new edge @xmath355 can be obtained by stretching an original edge from either endpoint of @xmath355 ) .    note that this edge stretching does not always succeed : it will fail when the connected component @xmath144 of @xmath47 along which we connect the points contains fewer than @xmath356 points of @xmath114 , or when there are fewer than @xmath326 points of @xmath114 between @xmath357 , and the  end \" of @xmath144 ( recall the constraint in the definition of the curves @xmath47 ) . still , the number of new edges in @xmath305 is at least @xmath358 , for a suitable constant @xmath359 , where the term @xmath360 accounts for missing edges on connected components of the curves , for the reasons just discussed . by what have just been argued ,",
    "the number of edges lost on any single component is at most @xmath361 .",
    "the final ingredient needed for this technique is an upper bound on the number of crossings between the ( new ) edges of @xmath305 .",
    "each such crossing is a crossing between two curves of @xmath137 . even though the two curves might overlap in a common irreducible component ( where they have infinitely many intersection points",
    ", none of which is a crossing ) , the number of proper crossings between them is @xmath362 , as follows , for example , from the milnor  thom theorem ( see @xcite ) , or from bzout s theorem . finally , because of the way the drawn edges have been stretched",
    ", the edges , even those drawn along the same original curve @xmath47 , may now overlap one another , and then a crossing between two curves may be claimed by more than one pair of ( stretched ) crossing edges .",
    "nevertheless , since no edge straddles more than @xmath326 points , the number of pairs that claim a specific crossing is still a constant ( that depends on @xmath13 ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the total number of edge crossings in @xmath305 is @xmath363",
    ".    we can now continue by applying the crossing lemma argument , exactly as done by szkely and in other works ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , and conclude that @xmath364 with the constant of proportionality depending on @xmath13 .",
    "this completes the proof of proposition  [ prop : incid ] .",
    "we do not know whether the bound in theorem  [ main ] is tight in the worst case , and suspect that it is not .",
    "resolving this question is a major problem for further research , especially since it arises in all the related specific and general problems in @xcite .    the specific problem studied in elekes et al .",
    "@xcite and in this paper is well motivated in  @xcite , because it yields a combinatorial distinction between unit circles and lines .",
    "that is , there exist three families of lines passing through three respective points , which determine @xmath365 triple points .",
    "nevertheless , this problem is clearly only one special instance of several related problems , in which we have three sets @xmath295 of points , each contained in some curve , and we want to bound the number of triples in @xmath52 that satisfy some property ( that can be specified by polynomial equation ) . as a simple example , consider the case where each @xmath50 is contained in some respective line @xmath366 , for @xmath1 , and the property is that the triple span a triangle of unit area . in a companion work in progress",
