    "this discrepancy could have originated from the different power indices between @xcite and ours . in order to estimate the effect of this potential uncertainty in determining the power index , we calculated fits to different portions of the early light curve , and a fit to the entire light curve excluding the rebrightening portion ( this simulates the result by @xcite ) and subtracted each of them from the light curve .",

    "@xcite tried to reproduce the rebrightening spike of v2362 cyg by assuming a temporary expansion of the pseudo - photosphere of the nova and estimated its temperature and radius .",
    "@xcite suggested that this temporary expansion was caused by a fast ejecta reaching the photosphere , resulting a significant increase in the density .",
    "although the authors attributed the rapid fading following the rebrightening peak to dust obscuration , the reason is unclear why and how dust formation took place around the peak .",
    "if this interpretation is also applicable to the extremely similar nova v1493 aql , the apparent lack of evidence of dust formation @xcite could be problematic . furthermore , a drastic expansion of the photosphere should affect the free - free component of the light curve , which is considered to dominate at this stage of nova evolution ( see equation 9 of @xcite ) .",
    "if such an expanded photosphere was obscured by dust formation , and the remaining light is from a `` detached shell '' , the subsequent evolution of the light curve should follow a steeper decline ( corresponding to the epoch after the wind stops , cf .",
    "@xcite ) rather than a smooth extrapolation of the early decline .",
    "emission lines would be also affected , while observations of strength of fitted emission of the main outburst ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) smoothly declined regardless of the rebrightening .",
    "these difficulties probably arise from an assumption of a continuous input of substantial amount of new ejecta into the preexisting one .",
    "we probably need a more dynamic , rather than this static , process .",
    "we then propose an alternative idea that the thin shock front formed by a limited amount of newly ejected matter , and potentially its breakout in the optically thick nova winds , comprises the rebrightening phenomenon .",
    "the spectra of v2362 cyg taken around the rebrightening maximum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) showed temporary appearance of strong and blue - shifted absorption components in the balmer - emission - line profiles .",
    "@xcite also noted an enhancement of a new component of emission lines during the rebrightening .",
    "such high - velocity component is expected to collide with the exterior , slower , preexisting winds , and will naturally produce a shock front ( cf .",
    "the detection of hard x - rays @xcite can also be attributed to the presence of a shock @xcite .",
    "the presence of optically thick wind provides a favorable condition that a breakout , if present , of such a shock becomes observable ( e.g. @xcite for a supernova / grb case ) .",
    "after the optically thick , geometrically thin shock front reaches the photosphere , and the energy loss via a kinetic motion dominates over the radiative transport , the subsequent rapid expansion and cooling of a thin shell can be naturally expected .",
    "the visibility of the high - velocity component only around the peak indicates that the velocity structure dramatically varied around the rebrightening peak . in the present picture",
    ", the matter outside the photosphere would remain largely untouched , preserving the general power law - type decline trend and behavior of emission lines arising from the outer optically thin region .",
    "dust formation may be associated with the quick expansion of the shock front , as discussed later , probably naturally explaining the temporal coincidence of the suggested dust formation around the rebrightening peak .",
    "the rising stage of the rebrightening , the exponential rise , commonly observed in these two novae appears to be harder to explain in any mechanism , and would be a challenge for theoreticians . within the present picture , we propose a working hypothesis that that photons emerging from a shock front constitute the exponentially rising , excess component .",
    "before the shock front reaches the photosphere , the photons from the shock front have an escape probability of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the optical depth from the shock front to the observer .",
    "the observer can thus see photons from the shock front attenuated by @xmath18 as an additional component .",
    "this interpretation corresponds to the `` radiative precursor '' phase of a shock breakout in a supernova @xcite . under the condition that the front is approaching the photosphere",
    ", @xmath19 is expected to decrease with time .",
    "a simple assumption of a constant rate of decrease of @xmath19 can explain an exponential rise .",
    "the parameter fits give characteristic time - scales of the rise corresponding to @xmath20 of 44(1 ) d and 14.6(2 ) d for v2362 cyg and v1493 aql , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath2 being @xmath39 d and @xmath34 d for respective novae , the result might suggest a positive relation between @xmath2 and the time - scale of the rise .",
    "our interpretation is different from that by @xcite in that they assumed continuous mass input to the photosphere during the entire rising stage of the rebrightening ( since day 170 , resulting an expansion of the photosphere ) while we assume the continuous presence of a shock front under the photosphere before the peak of rebrightening ( i.e. the front reaches the photosphere around the time of the peak ) .",
    "our interpretation in turn requires the presence of optically thick wind at the time of the shock formation .",
    "this can be tested whether the light curve follows by @xmath14 or by a steeper ( @xmath21 ) power law @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the fading part after the end of rebrightening ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the best fit powers @xmath23 for @xmath24 were 1.6(1 ) for the @xmath5-band and 1.2(2 ) for the @xmath25-band ( less affected by emission lines ) , which were closer to @xmath26 .",
    "this result suggests that the optical thick winds had not yet stopped at the epoch in question .",
    "the bluer color around the rebrightening peak , compared to the initial maximum @xcite also favors the presece of a hot shock front .",
    "most recently , @xcite reported @xmath27 multicolor light curves and attributed the later infrared peak to transient dust formation .",
    "the duration of the infrared peak was unusually short and it quickly decayed despite its optical thickness .",
    "this makes a contrast to other well - known novae with substantial dust formation @xcite .",
    "although this shortness may be attributed to the only transient formation of the dust , these light curves , alternatively , can be also interpreted as progressively slower maxima with longer wavelengths ; the same tendency is inferred from the optical work by @xcite .",
    "this characteristic may be understood as a manifestation of a shock breakout , analogous to the supernova case ( e.g. @xcite ) , although a red @xmath28 color would also require an excess reddening , i.e. the coexisting dust .",
    "this dependence between maxima times and wavelengths would be worth further investigation .",
    "a shock formed in an optically thick wind , and its potential subsequent breakout , is attractive in that it can not only naturally produce a rapid fade but also enable efficient dust production after its compression and subsequent rapid expansion in post - shock cooling as in wind - wind collision binaries ( e.g. @xcite ) . in v2362 cyg , at the epoch following the rapid fade , @xcite and @xcite reported an infrared excess and reddening which were attributed to dust formation in the inner region . the dust formation related to the expansion after a shock around the contracted photosphere is compatible with observations only slightly affecting emission lines and the power - law decline component , which is considered to arise from free - free emission in outer ejecta @xcite .",
    "we note that similar brightening phenomena accompanied by gradual brightening and rapid fade , although less conspicuous , are present in some other novae .",
    "the noteworthy examples include the fast nova v2491 cyg 15 d after maximum ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : v2491fit ] , vsnet - alert 10129 ) and the unusual , slowly evolving nova v1280 sco ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and potentially v5579 sgr ( vsnet - alert 10201 ) .",
    "@xcite tried to explain the behavior of v2491 cyg by introducing the polar - type magnetism and nova explosion - induced asynchronization .",
    "although this interpretation was apparently motivated by the difficulty in reproducing the rapid decline following the rebrightening , we do not consider this possibility in the present paper because the quiescent brightness of v2491 cyg is incompatible with a polar and because similar anomalies ( high quiescent x - ray luminosity ) were neither detected in v2362 cyg nor v1493 aql .",
    "the fading in v1280 sco was accompanied by dust formation occurring at an unexpectedly early epoch .",
    "although the mechanism of unusual variation in these novae is not well known , v2362 cyg / v1493 aql - type ejection of and shock formation at an early epoch may have played a role in producing unusual light variation and in dust production in a harsh environment ( cf .",
    "another commonly seen feature of a bump ( maximum ) following a premaximum halt in slow novae ( @xcite and references therein ) might be an extension of the same phenomenon .",
    "if this is the case , the fading rate ( such as @xmath2 ) derived from the fading portion of the bump would easily be an overestimate . the apparent discrepancy between the presence of a premaximum halt and very rapid fading in v463 sct @xcite",
    "might then be solved .",
    "a model incorporating more elaborate treatment of a shock formation in realistic nova winds and radiative transfer , which is beyond the scope of this paper , is needed for a comparison with observed light curves , color variations , and change in the profile of emission lines .",
    "considering the variety of phenomena potentially arising from this mechanism , a survey in a wide parameter space is encouraged .",
    "the reason why only some novae show this kind of late - stage rebrightening is still poorly known .",
    "the present interpretation suggests that if a second ejection in the late stage somehow occurs when the optically thick wind is still present , the resultant light curve should generally resemble those of the two objects investigated .",
    "such phenomena may have been overlooked in the past due to the limited high - precision observation .",
    "future systematic multiwavelength photometry and high - resolution spectroscopy are desired to better understand the phenomenon .",
    "x - ray observations are also expected to provide evidence for the shock in the nova wind .",
    "these observations should be aimed prospectively starting from the early rising stage of rebrightening .",
    "a deviation of the light curve from the power - law decline , as empirically shown in this paper , would provide a promising early warning signal for coordinating such observations , that is , real - time examination of nova light curves on @xmath29 plots will become a powerful diagnostic tool .",
