    "a motion through a nonstationary barrier is commonly treated as a combination of quanta absorption and tunneling .",
    "the particle pays in probability to absorb quanta and to reach the certain higher energy level but the subsequent tunneling is easier since it occurs in a more transparent part of the barrier .",

    ", a penetration through a nonstationary barrier can occur according to a scenario of a completely different physical nature .",
    "briefly , the basis of this phenomenon is a formation of under - barrier dynamical state which starts to move away of the barrier and carries a non - exponentially small fraction of the incident wave packet .",
    "this phenomenon is called euclidean resonance ( er ) since an outgoing flux depends sensitively on dynamical parameters @xcite . the same refers to an amplitude of the under - barrier state which can be called a resonant state .",
    "the phenomenon of euclidean resonance can be manifested in any physical process where tunneling is a substantial part . in particular",

    "in contrast to photon - assisted tunneling , the phenomenon of euclidean resonance is counterintuitive .",
    "this means that it is very hard to reduce it to a combination of known physical effects .",
    "euclidean resonance was established on the basis of solution of the schrdinger equation by methods of classical trajectories in complex time @xcite and by exact solution of hamilton - jacobi equation for the classical action ( semiclassical approximation @xcite ) .",
    "the last approach was mostly advanced but it was also not an exact mathematical solution of the whole problem since semiclassical approximation violated at the moment of formation of the under - barrier state and one had to go around that singular point .",
    "in this situation , any interpretation of euclidean resonance through a set of known physical effects would be very useful .",
    "unfortunately , such interpretation in the case of a general nonstationary barrier was not easy .",
    "another way , to interpret euclidean resonance , is to point out _ at least one _ particular nonstationary potential for which one can obtain a solution of the schrdinger equation of er type .",
    "then , on the basis of this mathematical solution , a physical interpretation would be possible",
    ". the nonstationary potential may be very specific and not necessary having a direct physical application .",
    "it is not important in this case since one should answer the general and non - trivial question : does the schrdinger equation allow a solution of er type in principal ? the answer is `` yes '' if one can find at lest one example of this type .",

    "when a potential barrier is acted by a nonstationary field another phenomenon enters the game .",
    "a particle can go through a barrier by a combined mechanism .",
    "schematically , this mechanism is a simultaneous absorption of quanta of nonstationary field and subsequent tunneling .",
    "this process is called photon - assisted tunneling .",

    "one or two quanta absorption has lower probability providing only a weak assistance of tunneling .",
    "when @xmath7 is not very small the number @xmath3 of absorbed quanta may be big and this multiquanta assistance of tunneling has essentially bigger probability compared to the static result @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "the probability of photon - assisted tunneling is not exponentially small only if a particle can effectively reach the barrier top ( no tunneling component in the process ) .",
    "this can happen , for example , when the nonstationary field is not small or its typical frequency @xmath9 is of the order of a barrier height .    in principal ,",
    "the idea of photon - assisted tunneling is clear and this mechanism was commonly considered as a unique one in physics of quantum mechanical motion through potential barriers .",

    "but it is not a unique one .",
    "a penetration through a nonstationary barrier can also occur according to a scenario of a completely different physical nature .",

    "if there is a steady incident flux of particles , with the energy @xmath1 , from the left to the barriers @xmath26 then the penetrated flux at @xmath31 strongly depends on @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 does not coincide with any discrete level tunneling processes through two barriers are not coherent . in this case the total tunneling probability through the double barrier @xmath26 is proportional to the product of partial probabilities @xmath32 .    under the condition @xmath33",
    ", one can say that a particle multiply reflects in the well between the barriers before to tunnel through the right one in fig .",

    "one should emphasize that this scenario holds in a static situation when incident and penetrated fluxes are steady . in this case the resonant level @xmath30 is highly occupied with the density @xmath34 .",
    "when an incident flux is not steady but is a wave packet of a finite length @xmath35 , as in fig .",

    "the energy uncertainty of the incident wave packet @xmath36 should not exceed the width @xmath37 of the energy level @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath38 the minimal length @xmath39 and the minimal duration @xmath40 of a wave packet obey the relations ( @xmath41 ) @xmath42 the duration @xmath43 of the wave packet is long which is sufficient to pump the resonant level up to the high occupation @xmath44 .",
