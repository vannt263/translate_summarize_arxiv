    "the long history of quasibound states dates back to the earliest days of quantum mechanics with schrdinger s successful calculation of stark splittings in atomic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "only later was it realized that the stark spectrum had no true eigenvalues ( a continuous spectrum ) , and that the perturbation series used to calculate the stark levels is , in fact , [ asymptotically ] divergent !",
    "the physical mechanism giving rise to this state of affairs ultimately was traced to the existence of quasi - stationary states caused by the perturbation of true bound states .",
    "the unstable nature of these states was recognized by oppenheimer , who apparently was the first to estimate their lifetime @xcite .",
    "a similar idea was subsequently advanced by gamow @xcite to explain alpha emission from radioactive nuclei , and by fowler and nordheim @xcite to account for the ` cold ' emission of electrons from metals .",
    "subsequently , quasi - stationary states came to be known as resonances or later , quasibound states : all refer to states with a high degree of localization embedded in an energy continuum of de - localized states @xcite .",
    "the excellent review by harrell @xcite traces the development of the mathematical foundations of quantum resonance theory from its earliest days up to the present .",
    "recently , there has been a resurgence of interest in quasibound states , driven in large part by their newly - discovered relevance to the areas of nanoscience and electronic devices .",
    "semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) and superlattices ( sls ) , which have been widely studied for more than three decades , have interesting electronic and optoelectronic properties that arise from the localization of carrier wave functions .",
    "accurate knowledge of the energy levels and wave functions of electrons in these structures is vital to their design , and resonant phenomena have been shown to be critical , both in understanding their principles of operation and in boosting performance .",
    "high performance qwips ( quantum well infrared photodetectors ) for example , rely on bound - to - quasibound rather than bound - to - bound transitions to enhance their sensitivity @xcite . and",
    "the kinetics of quasibound states have been identified as playing an essential role in the performance of quantum cascade lasers @xcite .",
    "lastly , recent photoreflectance experiments @xcite reveal the signature of quasibound states localized in a thick gaas barrier of ( in , ga)as / gaas heterostructures having alas interface layers .    the general theory of resonances in nanostructures was advanced by price @xcite , and efficient methods for their calculation soon followed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the methods fall into two broad categories , but each has its drawbacks .",
    "the simpler ( from a conceptual standpoint ) methods are based on an identification of quasibound state energies with peaks in the continuum density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the width of the dos peaks is taken as a measure of state lifetime , but the relation is imprecise and the widths themselves can be difficult to calculate for broad or overlapping resonances . aside from their relative ease of computation ,",
    "the dos - based methods possess another virtue : they yield _ real _ quasibound state energies with well - behaved wave functions that are essential for calculating related quantitites of interest , e.g. , dipole matrix elements involving quasibound states .",
    "the alternative methods rely on the rigorous definition of resonances as singularities of the scattering matrix ( @xmath0-matrix ) , and yield complex - valued energies whose imaginary part prescribes unambiguously the lifetime of these metastable states .",
    "however , the wave functions for these complex - energy states increase exponentially at the ends of the quantum structure , and are unbounded at infinity .",
    "such behaviour is unphysical , and dipole matrix elements involving these exponentially - increasing waveforms are ill - defined .    as early as 1997 , we championed another approach to characterizing quasibound states @xcite which has been largely overlooked in semiconductor device studies , perhaps because it was too narrow in scope ( quasibound states in a uniform electric field ) .",
    "the quasibound states described there have real energies with physically acceptable wave functions , thereby sharing the virtues of the dos - based methods described above .",
    "this feature was exploited effectively in ref.@xcite to study the behavior of the induced electric dipole moment in fields of arbitrary strength .",
    "the theory presented here builds on that earlier work by clarifying several crucial points and extending it to encompass a variety of continuous spectra , including those with degenerate energy levels .",
    "the result is a comprehensive framework for the study of quasibound states .",
    "central to these developments is the introduction of a new basis  essentially a fourier time transform of the spectral basis  that we have dubbed the _",
    "quantum history_.    the plan of the paper is as follows : following a brief introduction to quantum histories in sec .",
    "ii , a general method for selecting quasibound states is proposed and elaborated in secs .",
    "iii and iv . of necessity",
    ", this demands a precise definition of the term ` quasibound ' ; the one we adopt is rooted in a connectedness between the quasibound state and a true bound state brought about by the variation of some physical parameter . in sec .",
    "v we argue that this definition combined with the requirement of gauge invariance leads to just two fundamental types of quasibound states , viz . , ( 1 ) quantum resonances , and ( 2 ) , true stationary states , with real energies and bounded ( though not square - integrable ) wave functions . secs . vi ",
    "viii are devoted to developing concrete methods for calculating these stationary quasibound states in several important applications , distinguished by the spectral characteristics ( boundedness , degeneracy ) of the embedding continuum .",
    "the principal results are summarized in sec .",
    "throughout we adopt natural units in which @xmath1 , a choice that leads to improved transparency by simplifing numerous expressions .",
    "for a quantum system described by the hamiltonian operator @xmath2 , we define a set of states @xmath3 in the hilbert space to have the property@xmath4 ) are labeled by a continuous variable @xmath5 that we call the _ system time _ ; it extends over the whole domain of reals from the remote past ( @xmath6 ) to the distant future ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we refer to the set @xmath8 as a _ timeline _ or _ quantum history _ ; it is distinguished by the requirement that its elements ( the _ time states _",
    "@xmath3 ) can be combined to represent any physical state .",
    "we advance the conjecture that _ a timeline exists for every system , and constitutes a complete basis in the hilbert space_. the completeness of this basis is expressed by the closure rule for time states ; formally,@xmath9 , say @xmath10 , also span the space of physically realizable states to form the _ spectral basis _",
    "@xmath11 ) , the transformation from a timeline to the spectral basis is characterized by functions @xmath12 with the property@xmath13 where @xmath14 may still be a function of energy @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , ref.@xcite establishes that @xmath16 must be independent of @xmath15 to satisfy closure , and goes on to show how timelines can be constructed for virtually any system , starting from the stationary states of the associated hamiltonian .",
    "the role of degeneracy deserves special comment : _ a spectrum with _",
    "@xmath17__-fold degenerate levels breeds _ _",
    "distinct histories_. in other words , with degeneracy we get not just one , but multiple quantum histories with mutually orthogonal timelines , all of which must be included to span the hilbert space of physically realizable states .",
    "we seek to identify quasibound states described by the eigenvalue problem @xmath18 @xmath19 is that piece of the hamiltonian giving rise to the embedding continuum ; it is time - independent and hermitian , and normally would include  but is not limited to  the kinetic energy . for the present discussion",
    "we assume that the spectrum of @xmath19 is non - degenerate , with an associated single quantum history @xmath20 ( this restriction will be lifted later ) .",
    "@xmath21 is the interaction that is the source of the quasibound states , and is assumed to have _ compact support _ , so that the stationary state waveforms in the asymptotic region take the same mathematical form with or without @xmath21 .",

    ". then the integral term on the right of eq.([integral equation ] ) becomes simply @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , eq.([timeline - spectral link ] ) implies that the first term on the right can be written @xmath37 . combining these results , we arrive at an alternative formulation of the eigenvalue problem posed by eq.([eigenvalue problem ] )",
    "( with @xmath31 now replaced simply by @xmath5):@xmath38 eq.([hilbert ] ) is more fundamental than its expression in a particular basis , eq.([integral equation ] ) , and will be used exclusively in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we note that the non - uniqueness inherent in the original eq.([eigenvalue problem ] ) is manifested in eq.([hilbert ] ) by the parameter @xmath5 ( formerly @xmath31 ) , which can take any real value .",
    "the inhomogeneous structure of eq.([hilbert ] ) allows formal solutions to be found by repeated iteration . defining @xmath39",
    ", we get for any @xmath40:@xmath41 leaving aside questions of convergence , this development convincingly demonstrates that any state @xmath42 constructed in this manner is connected ( in the mathematical sense ) to the ` bare ' eigenstate @xmath10 , and thus persists even in the absence of the interaction @xmath21 .",
    "by contrast , solutions to the corresponding homogeneous equation@xmath43 owe their very existence to @xmath21 , vanishing if the interaction is too weak , or completely absent .",

    "the same property implies that any @xmath50 is a non - essential scale factor ( e.g. , a normalization choice ) whose value can be set independently of eq.([hilbert ] ) .",
    "evidently , it is the peculiar structure of eqs.([hilbert ] ) and ( [ green - timeline ] ) that preserves the identity of states ` sourced ' by @xmath21 even though they be embedded in a continuum , and it is illuminating to inquire what about this structure is crucial to our argument , quite apart from the manipulations leading up to it .",
    "now any procedure that transforms the eigenvalue problem posed by eq.([eigenvalue problem ] ) into a form like eq.([hilbert ] ) requires the operator inverse for @xmath51 .",
    "this inverse ( the green operator for @xmath19 ) we will denote simply by @xmath52 ; it satisfies@xmath53 but as is well - known , the inverse is not unique , for we can add to @xmath52 any projector of the form @xmath54 where @xmath10 is an eigenstate of @xmath19 with energy @xmath15 and @xmath55 is _ completely arbitrary_. eq.([green - timeline ] ) has just this structure . so in place of eqs.([hilbert ] ) and ( [ green - timeline ] ) we are led to consider the generalized pair    [ hilbert - general - pair]@xmath56 with @xmath57 so far an unspecified state .    to sort out those states generated by @xmath21 requires @xmath58 , a condition that is automatically satisfied by eq.([green - general ] ) provided only that@xmath59 exists and is non - zero . but to achieve faithful sorting , _ _ the existence and non - vanishing demands on__@xmath60 _ must be met for every energy _",
    "@xmath15 _ in the spectrum of _ @xmath19__. _ _ for lack of a better term , we will call states with this property _ taggers _ ; they uniquely identify the eigenstates of @xmath22 that are ` sourced ' by @xmath21 as having the property @xmath61 .",
    "eq.([timeline - spectral link ] ) shows that time states @xmath62  belonging to the history of @xmath19 are such taggers .",
    "other taggers are derivable from these by a restricted class of unitary transformations : we readily confirm that @xmath63   |\\,\\tau\\,\\rangle$ ] with @xmath64 any real function of @xmath19 is also a tagger , with @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly @xmath66 , too , is a time state of @xmath19 ; it differs from @xmath3 only according to how we fix the phases of the stationary states @xmath10 .",
    "[ we have stumbled here upon an important observation : the quantum history for @xmath19  is a gauge - dependent construct , with the time states in one gauge related to those in another by a unitary transformation ( more on this later ) . ]",
    "that said , we conclude that _ eqs.([hilbert - general - pair ] ) successfully generalize our previous results to arbitrary spectra , provided _",
    "@xmath57 _ is identified with an element in the timeline of _ @xmath19 .",
    "the ambiguity of these time states under gauge transformations notwithstanding , we simply label them and the associated green operator with the system time , writing @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "quasibound states @xmath42 satisfy @xmath44 ; equivalently , they are non - trivial solutions to the homogeneous eq.([hilbert-2 ] ) .",
    "we note that degenerate spectra give rise to various kinds of quasibound states , corresponding to the multiplicity of states @xmath3 for the same value of @xmath5 .",
    "ubiquitous among the quasibound states referenced in the literature are quantum resonances , i.e. , decaying states with complex energies .",
    "if the theory of quasibound states presented here is to include such resonances , it is not enough to assume that @xmath15 is confined to the axis of reals ; at a minimum , @xmath69 must be extended into those regions of the complex @xmath15-plane encompassing the solution space of eq.([hilbert-2 ] ) .",
    "to that end , we recognize in @xmath69 the _ resolvent operator _ for the ` bare ' hamiltonian @xmath19 @xcite :    @xmath70    the resolvent plays a central role in the formal treatment of quantum collisions , and its analytical properties as a function of the complex variable @xmath15 have been studied extensively .",
    "more to the point , the resolvent operator is intimately tied to scattering resonances : the latter correspond to poles of the scattering matrix ( @xmath0-matrix ) , analytically continued into the complex wavenumber ( or energy ) plane @xcite .",
    "these , in turn , coincide with the poles of the resolvent operator for the full hamiltonian , @xmath71 .",
    "but @xmath72 is related to @xmath73 by@xmath74 from which we deduce that the _ singularities _ of @xmath72 ( the resonance energies ) coincide with the _ zeros _ of @xmath75 .",
    "locating those zeros returns us to an equation like eq.([hilbert-2 ] ) , with @xmath76 there replaced by @xmath73 .",
    "thus we are led to speculate whether @xmath69 is equivalent to @xmath73 for some choice(s ) of @xmath5 .",
    "inspection of eq.([green - timeline ] ) suggests that @xmath77 becomes indistinguishable from @xmath78 in the limit of large @xmath5 _ provided _",
    "@xmath12 diverges in this limit .",
    "this heuristic argument can be made more precise by exploiting closure in the spectral basis of @xmath19 to write timeline matrix elements of eq.([green - timeline ] ) as @xmath79 ( eq.([timeline - spectral link ] ) has been invoked in writing the final form . )",
    "so long as @xmath15 is not real , the integrand in the last line is not singular anywhere on the path of integration ( which extends over all [ real ] energies @xmath80 in the continuous spectrum of @xmath19 ) .",
    "indeed , for @xmath81 this integral converges to a function that is analytic over the complex @xmath15-plane , except possibly on the real axis .",
    "furthermore , due to the rapid fluctuations of the exponential factor in the integrand , the integral vanishes as @xmath82 for all fixed values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . over large swaths of the complex @xmath15-plane ,",
    "then , we can expect @xmath85 accordingly , we assert that _ the quasibound states defined here for _ @xmath82 _ and the scattering resonances encountered in quantum collision theory are one and the same_.",
    "the property of timelines that they span the hilbert space suggests that eqs.([hilbert ] ) and ( [ green - timeline ] ) together furnish an exhaustive description of all those states generated by the interaction .",
    "in particular , @xmath86 for any eigenstate @xmath42 of @xmath22 that owes its existence to the presence of @xmath21 .",
    "there are several strategies we might employ to calculate quasibound states .",
    "one is to solve the homogeneous relation eq.([hilbert-2 ] ) for some fixed @xmath5 , noting that each such solution automatically satisfies @xmath87 .",
    "another is to solve the eigenvalue problem for the interacting system , eq.([eigenvalue problem ] ) , and supplement the results by imposing the quasibound state condition @xmath87 on the resulting eigenfunction .",
    "either way , one lingering question remains , viz .",
    ", how to choose the value for @xmath5 or , for that matter , how to resolve the phase ambiguity that breeds distinct ( though related ) quantum histories ?",
    "the two are really the same question , since a changed @xmath5 is itself the result of a gauge transformation ( with @xmath88 ) . and",
    "yet , we know a unitary transformation can not change the properties of a physical system ( in this case , quasibound state energies ) .",
    "so how do we reconcile this state of affairs ?",
    "put succinctly , the quasibound selection rule in the form @xmath44 is _ not _ manifestly gauge - invariant , which begs the question : can we find an alternate formulation that is ?",
    "further insight into this issue rests on two additional observations :    1 .",
    "regardless of the specific application , the spectral representation of time states encapsulated in eq.([timeline - spectral link ] ) together with closure in the spectral basis generated by @xmath19 allows the quasibound state selection rule to be recast as@xmath89 + the integral in eq.([criterion - general ] ) includes all energies @xmath90 in the [ continuous ] spectrum of @xmath19 , and @xmath91 is the quasibound wavefunction in the spectral basis generated by @xmath19 .",
    "2 .   for quasibound states with _ real energies _ , eq.([criterion - general ] ) must admit solutions for real values of @xmath15 , and this demand constrains the acceptable values we can choose for @xmath5 in that equation .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to such states as _ stationary quasibound states _",
    ", to distinguish them from the resonances so often identified with quasibound states .",
    "we note that stationary quasibound states are described by physically acceptable wave functions that can be used with confidence to calculate _ all _ properties of physical interest .",
    "precisely this feature was exploited successfully in ref.@xcite to elicit the divergent behavior of the electric dipole moment accompanying the onset of electrical breakdown for a bound charge subjected to a uniform electric field .    to explore the effect of a gauge transformation ,",
    "let us stipulate first that a gauge exists in which @xmath92 is itself real - valued for real @xmath15 and all pertinent [ real ] values of @xmath80 ( this appears always to be so , as will become evident from the applications discussed in subsequent sections ) .",
    "then eq.([criterion - general ] ) admits real roots @xmath15 only if @xmath93 ( for @xmath94 , complex conjugation results in a distinct equation that , along with the original , over - constrains the problem ) .",
    "equivalently , the selection rule for stationary quasibound states in this gauge reduces to @xmath95 .",
    "next , consider a gauge transformation that results in the replacement @xmath96   \\,\\langle\\,e^{\\prime}\\,|\\,\\psi_{e}\\,\\rangle$ ] . to recover real roots in this instance ,",
    "we must employ a time state that is a unitary transform of @xmath97 , namely @xmath98   |\\,0\\,\\rangle$ ] .",
    "but this leads to the same equation for @xmath15 as before ( viz .",
    ", eq.([criterion - general ] ) with @xmath93 ) .",
    "thus , _ the specification of stationary quasibound states is indeed gauge - invariant _ , but all conceivable time states must be entertained to accomodate a general phase assignment when constructing the eigenstates of @xmath19__. _ _ preserving this flexibility , it would appear , is the principal role of the parameter @xmath5 in eq.([hilbert ] ) .",
    "conversely , while complex roots @xmath15 to eq.([criterion - general ] ) typically exist for any finite value of @xmath5 , they most assuredly _ would _ be affected by a phase reassignment ( unitary transformation ) , and therefore can not represent any observable property .",
    "the arguments of the preceding paragraph indicate that only in the limits @xmath82 might we find a gauge - invariant rule for calculating quasibound states with complex energies .",
    "that such states do indeed exist and are to be identified with the scattering resonances of quantum collision theory was argued in the preceding section .",
    "these , then , are the only physically permissable outcomes : _ stationary quasibound states may exist , and do so alongside scattering resonances as the only possibilities for states truly deserving of the branding ` quasibound ' . _    in the next three sections we will take up quasibound state formation as it relates to a several distinct choices for @xmath19 , each specifying what we call an _ application class_. in every instance we exhibit the time states @xmath3 for that class , and establish the appropriate [ gauge - invariant ] selection rule(s ) for stationary quasibound states in such applications .",
    "this is followed by calculations for a model potential that serve to illustrate the formalism in a specific context .",
    "in this  arguably the simplest  case , we take @xmath99 , with @xmath100 denoting the classical force .",
    "this force has the same magnitude and direction everywhere , rendering the problem essentially one - dimensional .",
    "the spectrum is non - degenerate , and stretches continuously from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "while the unbounded nature of the spectrum from below is considered unphysical , this model nonetheless serves a useful purpose by sidestepping the issue of boundary conditions at the potential energy minimum .",
    "time states for continuous , unbounded spectra are constructed as an ordinary fourier transform of the spectral basis states ( cf .",
    "eq.([timeline - spectral link ] ) ) . in the coordinate basis , @xmath103 the stationary state waves @xmath104  for this case are airy functions @xcite",
    "; in turn , these give rise to timeline components that are simply plane waves @xcite:@xmath105 it is a straightforward matter to confirm that the timeline waves of eq.([waves - open ] ) are orthogonal , and obey the closure rule of eq.([closure rule ] ) .",
    "quasibound states @xmath42 are most simply characterized by @xmath44 . expressing this condition in the coordinate basis , we get@xmath106 where @xmath107 is the schrdinger waveform for the stationary state of @xmath22 with energy @xmath15 . apart from an overall scale factor ,",
    "these are real functions so long as @xmath21 has compact support .",
    "thus , the quasibound selection rule admits real roots @xmath15 only if @xmath108 also is real ( apart from a scale factor ) , which in this gauge requires @xmath93 , or ( cf .",

    "the last integral on the right of eq.([criterion - twin - even ] ) diverges , whereas the remaining terms are bounded for all @xmath280 .",
    "it follows that the coefficient of the divergent integral must vanish in this limit .",
    "careful analysis of eq.([criterion - twin - even ] ) shows that for large @xmath281@xmath406 since the zeros of the expression on the left locate the energies of even - parity states in the finite square well of width @xmath396 , the even - parity stationary quasibound levels evidently merge with those bound state energies in the limit @xmath258 . also since there is but one even - parity state at each energy  either with or without the ` sourcing ' potential @xmath130  the stationary quasibound state waveforms must converge to the even - parity bound state wave functions of the finite well in this limit .",
    "2 .   unlike the odd - parity case",
    ", there is no minimum barrier thickness required to sustain even - parity quasibound states in the central well , so at least one such state always exists .",
    "a more refined statement follows by writing eq.([criterion - twin - even ] ) in the form@xmath407 where @xmath285 and @xmath286 are the same expressions encountered previously in our study of the ` leaky ' spherical well , and subject to the estimates eq.([bounds - ab ] ) .",

    "numerical investigation shows that the first ( highest ) maximum is reached for @xmath410 and the function value there is @xmath411 .",
    "we conclude that multiple even - parity , stationary quasibound states are unsustainable if@xmath412 again , the bound of eq.([cutoff - thin barrier - even ] ) is not rigorous , but represents a reasoned estimate that can guide more in - depth studies .    for resonances in the scattering from twin symmetric barriers , we turn again to the work of maheswari , et .",
    "@xcite , this time with focus on the symmetric states described in their study . with @xmath300 ( in units where @xmath138 ) and @xmath299 they report three symmetric resonances below the top of the barrier ( @xmath306 ) , at energies @xmath413 , @xmath414 , and @xmath415 . using the same parameter values , we find just one even - parity , stationary quasibound state at energy @xmath416 . the wave function for this quasibound state",

    "4 , where it is compared with the bound state wave function to which it converges in the thick barrier limit @xmath258 . the two are in good agreement where they must be , viz . , within the central well and near the inner barrier edge ; they differ noticeably in the outer half of the barrier and beyond .",
    "our finding of only one quasibound state is actually inconsistent with the bound of eq.([cutoff - thin barrier - even ] ) , which for @xmath300 predicts a critical barrier thickness @xmath417 .",
    "in fact , the actual value is about @xmath303 larger , at @xmath418 .",
    "this level of discrepancy is not surprising given the lack of rigor inherent in eq.([cutoff - thin barrier - even ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have advocated the viewpoint that states described as ` quasibound ' should exhibit a connectedness ( in the mathematical sense ) to true bound states through the growth of some parameter .",
    "and we have demonstrated how this connectedness can be formulated in a rigorous way using the novel concept of quantum histories , or timelines , that span the hilbert space of physical states .",
    "the principle that a change of gauge can not influence the outcome of a measurement restricts the quasibound states to one of two basic types : ( 1 ) stationary quasibound states that are characterized by real energies and schrdinger wave functions that are everywhere bounded ( but not square - integrable ) , and ( 2 ) , resonant states having complex energies ( and consequently divergent waveforms ) that correspond to poles in the complex @xmath15-plane of the scattering or @xmath0-matrix . heretofore ,",
    "only the latter have been recognized in much of the quasibound state literature . that both are rooted in the same underlying principle of connectedness leads to the expectation that stationary quasibound states and resonant states admit identical perturbation expansions in the growth parameter whenever such series developments exist , i.e. , the two quasibound types can not be distinguished in the perturbative regime .",
    "the general theory has been applied to three diverse systems exemplifying distinct spectral characteristics ( bounds , degeneracies ) of the hamiltonian for the embedding continuum . within each such application class ,",
    "the stationary quasibound states of a model system have been explored and compared with previously reported results for resonant states .",
    "the calculations are aimed at highlighting the differences between the two basic quasibound types , while also emphasizing their common origins .",
    "future work will focus on further exploring these model systems , while also entertaining other application classes that encompass problems of widespread physical interest .",
    "our model results confirm that stationary quasibound states with the properties advertised are prescribed correctly by the theory .",
    "but under what circumstances might they actually be observed ?",
    "given that these are states with real energies connected to true bound states by the growth of a parameter , the adiabatic approximation provides an answer : starting from a bound state , evolution proceeds through the connected quasibound state as the controlling parameter increases , _ provided the growth rate is ` small'_. to formulate this idea more carefully , we follow schiff @xcite in writing ( approximately ) the transition amplitude from the initial state labeled @xmath419 to any other instantaneous eigenstate @xmath420 of the full hamiltonian @xmath2 as@xmath421 where @xmath422 .",
    "we observe with schiff that the probability of populating states other than the initial one simply oscillates in time , and shows no steady increase over long periods .",
    "but the amplitude of these oscillations is fixed by @xmath423 , i.e. , directly proportional to the growth rate and inversely proportional to the level spacing . for continuous spectra ( @xmath424 )",
    ", negligible transition amplitude would require infinitesimal growth rates , but the continuum approximation is a mathematical convenience that is never realized in practice .",
    "confining boundaries introduce level separations and matrix elements that scale inversely with system size .",
    "if the length scale of the system is set by @xmath425 , we can expect @xmath426 and @xmath427 @xmath428 .",
    "in such systems @xmath429 can be kept small if @xmath430 .",
    "we conclude that experimental evidence for the ideas presented here is likely to be found among mesoscopic systems where the interaction can be varied slowly and with great precision .",
    "resonances always connote decaying states , described by the stationary form @xmath431 with complex energy @xmath15 whose imaginary part directly determines the state lifetime .",
    "common usage suggests that quasibound states are synonomous with resonances , but a distinction often is drawn when they are constructed following a procedure that endows them with real energies . in our view , ` quasibound ' is the more inclusive term , and our usage in this manuscript reflects that bias .",
