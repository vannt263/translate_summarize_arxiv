    "weak  absorbers are defined to be those with rest frame equivalent widths @xmath0 and represent a different population than strong  absorbers @xcite .",

    "* but see @xcite for some exceptions ) .",
    "the exact environment(s ) and process / processes that give rise to weak  absorbers is not yet known , but they may arise in dwarf galaxy environments , in the cosmic web surrounding galaxies , and/or in high velocity clouds .",
    "weak  absorbers generally correspond to sub - lyman limit systems ( @xmath8 $ ] ) @xcite and they have metallicities of at least 10% solar and as high as solar or even supersolar @xcite .",
    "in addition , the /  ratio of some absorbers does not allow for @xmath9-enhancement , thus type ia supernovae must contribute as well as type ii .",
    "because type ia supernovae can not eject metals to large distances , metals must be produced `` _ _ in situ _ _ '' .",
    "the number statistics and kinematics of single cloud weak  absorbers lend themselves best to a flattened geometry and suggest that the absorbers may be produced by higher density regions in the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "absorption typically arises in a high density region @xmath10 1100 pcs thick which is often surrounded by a lower density region that gives rise to high ionization  absorption centered at the same velocity as the  @xcite .",
    "additional low density regions producing  absorption , that are detected at different velocities than , often exist .",
    "while most weak  absorbers can be fit by a single voigt profile component , about one third have multiple components @xcite .",
    "some of these multiple cloud weak  absorbers are weaker versions of strong  absorbers with similar kinematics , as if they arise in the outskirts or in sparse regions of luminous galaxies .",
    "others , which tend to have more kinematically compact profiles , have been hypothesized to arise in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "when exploring the nature of weak  absorbers , two methods are often used ",
    "statistical surveys and photoionization modeling of individual systems .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite conducted surveys of systems with equivalent widths in the range @xmath11 , which when combined , span the redshift range @xmath12 . these surveys obtained number densities of absorbers per unit redshift ( @xmath5 ) : @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , and @xmath15 @xcite . apparently , the population of weak  absorbers peaks at @xmath3 over the range @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the density of absorbers at @xmath4 is significantly lower than expected if the change in @xmath5 was due only to cosmological effects and to the changing extragalactic background radiation @xcite .",
    "this indicates that either the same process creates weak  absorbers across this redshift range but was less active at @xmath4 than at @xmath3 , or that the physical mechanisms responsible for creating the absorbers change across redshift and are more efficient at @xmath3 than at @xmath4 .",
    "it should be noted that this trend in @xmath5 is consistent with the star formation history in dwarf galaxies @xcite , which may suggest that weak  absorbers are related to this activity .",
    "photoionization models facilitate the exploration of the physical properties of the absorption system , such as ionization parameter , density , temperature , abundance pattern , and size . by understanding these properties for absorbers at different redshifts",
    ", we can gain insight into what processes create them . if different processes are responsible for the formation of these absorbers at different epochs , then the physical properties of the absorbers are likely to evolve .",
    "if no statistical difference in the physical properties is observed , this would suggest that the same mechanism is responsible for creating weak  absorbers at different epochs . to this end , we have produced photoionization models of the nine @xmath1 systems found by @xcite using the code cloudy @xcite and compared our results to those of systems at lower redshift @xcite .",
    "our methodology for modeling the systems is the subject of   [",
    "sec : method ] . in   [ sec : props ] we report the results of our models for each individual system . in   [ sec : disc ] we discuss our results and their implications for the population of weak  absorbers and end with a conclusion in   [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the 9 systems selected for modeling were taken from @xcite , and were identified through a detection of a weak mg0.1emii  @xmath16  doublet in the redshift range @xmath1 .",
    "the systems were chosen because they lie in a region of redshift - space ( @xmath1 ) that previous weak  studies have not looked at . in order to be accepted as a true detection , the mg0.1emii  @xmath16  had to be detected at at least a @xmath17 significance level in  @xmath182796 . for a detailed discussion of the data reduction procedure see @xcite , and for a discussion of the survey method see @xcite .",
    "once an absorption system was identified , the doppler parameter and column density of the mg0.1emii  @xmath16  doublet were measured from a voigt profile fit to the doublet using minfit @xcite .",
    "this code finds the minimum number of components required for an adequate fit to the observed absorption of .",
    "the measured  column density was used as a direct constraint for the photoionization code cloudy 94.00 last described by @xcite ( i.e. the photoionization models were `` optimized '' on the column density of ) . for each cloud ( separate voigt profile component )",
    "a grid was constructed for which the metallicity ( @xmath19 ) and ionization parameter ( @xmath20 ) were changed in incremental values , typically in steps of 0.5 dex .",
    "a solar abundance pattern was assumed unless otherwise noted .",
    "a haardt & madau ionizing background of quasars plus star forming galaxies with a photon escape fraction of 0.1 for @xmath21 , was used at the redshift of each system @xcite .",
    "this radiation was assumed to be incident on a plane parallel slab .",
    "cloudy calculated column densities for all detected transitions and an equilibrium temperature for the cloud .",
    "this temperature was used along with the measured doppler parameter of  to calculate the turbulent / bulk motion contribution to the total doppler parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "this @xmath23 was then applied to calculate the expected @xmath24 for every other element , again using the equilibrium temperature given by cloudy .",
    "the model column densities and doppler parameters of all clouds were used to generate a synthetic spectrum which was convolved with the instrumental profile appropriate for uves , @xmath25 .",
    "these were compared to the data by using @xmath26 indicators combined with profile inspection in order to refine the metallicity and ionization parameter values of the model . at times , it was necessary to adjust the abundance pattern of the model in order to achieve an adequate fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "the effect of such changes on model parameters is given in the individual system descriptions .",
    "we assume a solar abundance pattern unless otherwise stated .",
    "many of the low wavelength transitions fell in the  forest and contained significant blends . in this case , a model was taken to be acceptable if it did not overproduce the observed absorption of a given transition .",
    "however , when blends were not present , a more exact match was required . in some cases",
    "a range of model parameters produced an adequate fit .",
    "in the case of blends , an upper or lower limit was often the only constraint that could be obtained .    in most cases",
    ", there was absorption in higher ionization transitions that cloudy could not reproduced through the low ionization  phase ( i.e. the clouds that were optimized on the  column density ) .",
    "this happened either because the high ionization absorption was too broad to arise from the low ionization phase , or because the high ionization absorption was not sufficiently produced for ionization parameters that provided a sufficient fit to low and intermediate ionization absorption . in these cases , the doppler parameters and column densities of the c0.1emiv",
    "@xmath27  doublet were measured using minfit and cloudy models were produced , optimizing on .",
    "the combined low and high ionization phase models were compared to the data .",
    "separate constraints on metallicity and ionization parameter were obtained for the high ionization clouds , when possible . however , it is common that the low ionization phase has only a lower limit on metallicity in order not to overproduce  absorption . for higher values of metallicity , an additional contribution to  from the high ionization phase would be required . in the event that there was a blend in the expected location of the c0.1emiv  @xmath27  doublet ,",
    "the si0.1emiv  @xmath28  doublet was used instead .",
    "if there were blends in the expected locations of both these transitions , no constraint on the high ionization phase could be obtained ( though this was a problem for only the @xmath29 system toward he0151 - 4326 ) .",
    "in addition to a haardt & madau ionizing background of quasars plus star forming galaxies with a photon escape fraction of 0.1 for @xmath21 , the effect of using an ionizing background including only quasars was also explored . in most cases ,",
    "this change had little effect , and the small effect it did have was only seen in the high ionization gas .",
    "the sole exception is the @xmath30 absorber towards q0122 - 380 , for which the effect of the change of spectral shape is described in   [ sec : s3 ] .",

    "we include the 9 systems at @xmath1 from the survey of @xcite as well as systems from @xcite with @xmath94 .",
    "we consider single and multiple cloud weak  absorbers separately , since they are likely to have different origins .",
    "one of the most important basic properties of single cloud weak  absorbers at @xmath95 is their two phase structure .",
    "is found to arise in a higher density region , while the strength of the  absorption requires a separate , lower density region @xcite . this same two phase structure is also found in all four single cloud weak  absorbers at @xmath1 for which it was possible to place a constraint on a second phase .",
    "the other two single cloud weak  absorbers in the @xmath1 sample had blends at the expected location of  that prevented us from deriving a constraint .",
    "for comparison , the weaker extragalactic background radiation ( ebr ) at @xmath96 would lead to broader  components arising from the high ionization phase of single cloud weak  absorbers , and to detectable  absorption from some structures that at higher redshift produced only high ionization absorption @xcite .",
    "most @xmath95 multiple cloud weak  absorbers also require separate phases to explain simultaneously the observed  and  absorption .",
    "our three multiple cloud weak absorbers at @xmath1 also required two phase models . at both redshift regimes ,",
    "we see examples of -deficient multiple cloud weak  absorbers , where a second phase may not be needed ( e.g. , the @xmath97 system toward pg@xmath98 @xcite and the @xmath99 system toward pg@xmath100 @xcite ) or is needed , but produces only weak absorption ( our @xmath74 system toward he2347 - 4342 ) .",
    "thus there may be a difference between single and multiple cloud weak  absorbers in the fraction that have a second , lower density phase producing relatively significant  absorption .",

    "the multiple cloud weak  absorbers do not usually have a direct correspondence between the  and the  clouds . in both types of absorbers",
    ", we might postulate a sheetlike or shell geometry , with separate layers responsible for the  and  absorption .",
    "however , in the case of the single cloud  absorbers it would appear that the layers are quite quiescent , and are moving in unison .",
    "this would suggest an origin in an environment that has not experienced recent star formation or turbulence .",

    "there is no apparent change in these parameters across redshift .",

    "limits for @xmath104 of the high redshift systems are consistent with those of the low redshift systems . to verify that there is no significant evolution",
    ", we applied the spearman - kendall nonparametric rank correlation tests , which take into account the upper limits in the data @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : mcnh ] shows @xmath104 vs. @xmath103 for multiple cloud absorbers .",
    "although our sample size is small , again there is no obvious change in the properties of the absorbers across redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : scz ] shows @xmath19 vs. @xmath103 for single cloud absorbers .",
    "metallicity constraints could not be obtained for all absorbers because there was not always coverage of the  line . taking into account the limits",
    ", we can not see a significant change in the properties with redshift .",
    "the spearman - kendall tests yielded a large probability ( 0.80 and 0.33 ) that there is no correlation .",
    "however , it is worth noting that we do yet know of a @xmath105 absorber with a high ( close to solar ) metallicity .",
    "there are a few solar or higher metallicity absorbers ( 25% of the sample ) at @xmath106 .",
    "figure [ fig : mcz ] shows @xmath19 vs. @xmath103 for multiple cloud absorbers . once again , we suffer from a small sample size , but the metallicities of the high redshift systems are consistent with those of the low redshift systems .    first , we consider the possible implications of our results on the multiple - cloud absorbers .",
    "this class can be broadly grouped into two categories .",
    "first , there are those multiple cloud absorbers that are `` kinematically spread '' and are likely to be `` almost - strong ''  absorbers for which the line - of - sight simply does not pass through dense regions of gas .",
    "second , there are those multiple cloud absorbers that are `` kinematically compact '' and are likely dwarf galaxies or are associated with dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 system toward q0122 - 380 is an example of a kinematically compact absorber .",
    "the metallicity of this system is constrained to be @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath108 system towards he2217 - 2818 and the @xmath109 system toward q0453 - 423 are examples of kinematically spread absorbers .",
    "the metallicities of these two systems are constrained to be @xmath110 and @xmath87 . because the metallicities of our systems are not well constrained",
    ", we can not draw any definite conclusions about the environments in which each type of system arises .",
    "the redshift path density of single cloud weak  absorbers is observed to decrease between @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "some of this evolution is due to the changing ebr which ranges from @xmath111 $ ] between @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the effect of the changing ebr is to lead to more low ionization  gas at lower redshift .",
    "in addition , cosmological effects will lead to a decrease in the density of weak  absorbers at lower redshift .",
    "when these two competing effects are taken together , they can not fully account for the lower @xmath5 at @xmath4 .",
    "the range of physical conditions that were found in this study ( column density , doppler parameter , density , and metallicity ) for systems at redshift @xmath1 do not show a statistical variation from systems at redshift @xmath95 .",
    "the ranges are large , constraints are derived using different transitions at different redshifts , and our samples are small , leading to dilution of any trends . however , at face - value our result is consistent with the idea that the evolution in the weak  absorber population from @xmath112 to @xmath113 is due to an increase in the efficiency of the mechanisms that create weak  absorbers , and not due to a change in the actual mechanisms .",
    "for example , if a collapse process gave rise to weak  absorbing structures , then , to first order , one would expect a constant range of densities across redshift .",
    "since we see such a constant range , the observed evolution in @xmath5 would then be attributed to a change in the number of structures undergoing such a collapse as a function of redshift .",
    "we now turn our attention to the effects of a changing metallicity . as metallicity generally increases with decreasing redshift",
    ", we would expect that , at low redshift , lower total hydrogen column density absorbers cold give rise to weak  absorption .",
    "this would lead to a rise in the number of weak  absorbers . in our data",
    "set , although there is no statistically significant trend , an increase in metallicity with decreasing redshift is still consistent with the data . because we have a relatively small data set and only have limits in most cases",
    ", we can not draw a firm conclusion on the change in metallicity across redshift .",
    "thus it is possible that the increase in weak  absorbers at lower redshift is at least in part due to a systematic increase in metallicity .",
    "this may be a fruitful avenue for future study .",
    "to improve metallicity constraints , we would need access to lower lyman series lines .",
    "the narrow , low ionization components have a dominant contribution to these lyman series lines , while the  absorption can have contributions from broader components ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure 4 therein ) .",
    "in summary , through our modeling we have found that the properties of single cloud weak  absorbers at @xmath1 are similar to those of single cloud weak  absorbers at @xmath95 .",
    "these properties include the existence of two phases , the gas densities , the doppler parameters , the relatively high metallicities , and the presence of offset components .",
    "it is striking that the dominant component , although produced in a different phase , is centered at the same velocity as the cloud . using the facts that almost all absorbers are found within @xmath114  kpc of luminous galaxies and that half of absorbers have weak absorption , @xcite argued that weak absorbers are likely to arise @xmath115-@xmath116  kpc from luminous galaxies .    of course , the fundamental goal of our study is to identify single cloud weak absorbers with a specific environment and physical process .",
    "the lack of evolution in their properties suggests a common mechanism working over time .",
    "the various possibilities include shells or supernova remnants in dwarf galaxies , high velocity clouds , and shells of enriched material surrounding galaxies in the cosmic web .",
    "these possibilities have in common the feature that the high and low ionization gas could be separated , but moving at the same velocity , consistent with the arguments of @xcite .    @xcite note that the star formation history in dwarf galaxies seems to be consistent with the evolution of the absorber population , and suggest that this is a possible process that could give rise to weak  absorbers .",
    "the fact that there is no significant change in the properties of the population across redshift suggest that this scenario is possible .",
    "we note that if this idea is correct , then star formation in the regions would have stopped long ago .",
    "no uv photons would be left , and so we are justified in using a background spectrum rather than local stellar sources .",
    "the results of the present study are consistent with the dwarf galaxy hypothesis .",
    "the origin of single cloud weak absorbers in the extragalactic analogs of high velocity clouds also remains a possibility .",
    "the appeal of this scenario is consistency with the phase structure found in milky way high velocity clouds @xcite , the similar velocities between low and high ionization gas in the high velocity clouds , and the large covering factor of the sky by milky way high velocity clouds @xcite .",
    "if milky way high velocity clouds are produced by cool / warm clouds sweeping through the galactic corona , a similar phenomenon would be expected to occur around other galaxies , leading to typical impact parameters of @xmath117-@xmath116  kpc for lines of sight that pass through the high velocity cloud , but not through the luminous galaxy disk .",
    "any distinction between these sheetlike high velocity clouds structures and portions of the cosmic web clustered near galaxies may just be a matter of semantics .",
    "comparisons between the absorption in single cloud weak absorbers and in milky way high velocity clouds is a useful diagnostic , though challenging because of the location of in the forest .",
    "we used the photoionization code cloudy to model nine weak  absorption systems found by @xcite .",
    "the doppler parameter and column density of  were measured using the minfit program @xcite , and these were used as constraints by cloudy .",
    "the ionization parameter and metallicity were then adjusted incrementally in cloudy for each  cloud until the simulated absorption profiles matched the observed absorption profiles of other transitions in the spectra .",
    "it was usually necessary to include a second , high ionization phase in order to reproduce the observed absorption in .",
    "this was necessary because the  profile was too broad and/or too strong to arise solely from the  phase gas .",
    "it was sometimes the case that only an upper or lower limit could be placed on the conditions of the system due to blends at the expected locations of certain transitions .",
    "these results were then compared to models of absorbers at @xmath95 and checked for any evolution across redshift .    * 6/9 systems had only a single component of absorption in  ( single cloud ) and the remaining three showed multiple components ( multiple cloud ) * a multiphase structure was required in 7/9 systems .",
    "one system had blends at the expected location of  and  and no definite conclusions about a multiphase structure could be reached . in another system ,",
    "the  profile was weak enough that a second phase was not definitely needed , though it was preferred .",
    "* for single cloud systems we find the following constraints on physical properties : * for multiple cloud systems we find the following constraints on physical properties :    the properties of the absorber population as stated above are not significantly different across the redshift range @xmath2 , i.e. the variation in parameters over the sample of absorbers that produce weak  absorption is larger than any systematic evolution with redshift .",
    "these properties include the presence of two phases to produce and absorption and the density of the gas that produces absorption . with a limited number of metallicity constraints at high redshift ,",
    "the data are consistent either with constant metallicity from @xmath2 , or with a metallicity that increases with time . with our increased sample size ,",
    "one of the most significant results is that a required high ionization cloud is always centered within @xmath118  @xmath102 of the single cloud weak absorption .",
    "the lack of evolution in the properties of single cloud weak absorbers implies that the change in the number statistics of absorbers across redshift is due to changes in the rate of relevant processes and not due to a change in the nature of these processes that give rise to weak  absorbers . another possibility for explaining the evolution of the number of weak  absorbers is a systematic increase in metallicity of the absorbing structures from @xmath4 to @xmath3 .",
    "the close correspondence in the velocities of the low and high ionization phases suggests a layered structure which physically could be consistent with supernova remnants or winds in dwarf galaxies , or with extragalactic analogs to high velocity clouds .",
