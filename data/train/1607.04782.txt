    "the process of particle creation from quantum vacuum because of moving boundaries or time - dependent properties of materials , commonly referred as the dynamical casimir effect ( dce)@xcite , has been investigated since the pioneering works of moore in 1970 @xcite , who showed that photons would be created in a fabry - perot cavity if one of the ends of the cavity walls moved periodically , @xcite .",
    "the dynamical casimir effect is frequently used nowadays for phenomena connected with the photon creation from vacuum due to fast changes of the geometry or material properties of the medium .",
    "moving bodies experience quantum friction @xcite and so energy damping @xcite and decoherence @xcite due to the scattering of vacuum field fluctuations .",
    "the damping is accompanied by the emission of photons @xcite , thus conserving the total energy of the combined system @xcite .",
    "an explicit connection between quantum fluctuations and the motion of boundaries was made in @xcite , where the name non - stationary casimir effect was introduced , and in @xcite , where the names mirror induced radiation and motion - induced radiation ( with the same abbreviation mir ) were proposed .",
    "the frequency of created photons in a mechanically moving boundary are bounded by the mechanical frequency of the moving body and to observe a detectable number of created photons the oscillatory frequency must be of the order of ghz which arise technical problems .",
    "therefore , recent experimental schemes focus on simulating moving boundaries by considering material bodies with time - dependent electromagnetic properties @xcite . in this scheme , for example for two semi - infinite dielectrics",
    ", the boundary is not moving mechanically but its moving is simulated or modelled by changing the electromagnetic properties of one of the dielectrics in a small slab periodically . an important factor in detecting the created photons",
    "is keeping the sample at a low temperature of @xmath1 100 mk to suppress the number of thermal black body photons to less than unity .",
    "particularly , the problem has been considered with mirrors ( single mirror and cavities ) , where the input field reflected completely from the surface .",
    "recently the robin boundary condition ( rbc ) has been used as a helpful approach to consider the dynamical boundary condition for this kind of problem .",
    "the well known drichlet and neuwmann boundary conditions can be obtained as the limiting cases of robin boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to use a perturbative approach to study the effect of transition trough the interface on the spectral distribution of created photons .",
    "the interface between two semi - infinite dielectrics is modelled to simulate the oscillatory motion of the moving boundary . for this purpose , the electromagnetic field quantization in the presence of a dielectric medium @xcite",
    "is reviewed briefly then a general approach to investigate the dynamical casimir effect for simulated motion of some part of a dielectric medium is introduced and finally , the spectral distribution of created photons are derived and the effect of small transitions trough the interface has been discussed .",
    "in this section we review briefly the electromagnetic field quantization in the presence of two adjacent semi - infinite absorbing media with different homogeneous and isotropic dielectric functions @xcite .",

    "the inhomogeneous nature of the problem requires the imposition of boundary conditions on the spatial mode functions on the interface .",
    "the vector potential in frequency space satisfies the familiar equation @xcite @xmath5 we can decompose any field to its positive and negative frequency parts then the positive frequency part of the vector potential is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the interface area and the green s function fulfills the equation @xmath8 the green s function is obtained explicitly as     +    @xmath9}{c } ) , \\qquad x>0,\\,\\,x'<0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath10}{c } ) , \\quad x<0,\\,\\,x'>0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the usual transmission and reflection coefficients respectively , and the subscript indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to the light incident on the interface from the right or left .",

    "this property can be used to determine the terms in ( [ a ] ) which correspond to @xmath19 and @xmath26 easily .",
    "motivated by experiments in which moving boundaries are simulated by time dependent properties of static systems including , changing the effective inductance of the squid by a time - dependent magnetic flux @xcite or mir experiment @xcite and also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , we discuss here a model to change the dielectric function of a slab dielectric with thickness @xmath27 which is placed at the interface of semi infinite absorbing dielectrics and its dielectric function oscillates between @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the frequencies @xmath30 .",

    "but here the spectrum ( [ n3 ] ) is the symmetry around @xmath105 where the spectrum has a peak over there ( figure ( [ nem1 ] ) ) , and in this case the spectrum is valuable just for @xmath96 too close to unity or in case of complete reflection .",
    "as a result of the figure ( [ nem ] ) and ( [ nem1 ] ) , spectrum decrease rapidly by the decrease in value of @xmath106 and actually for a small variation from @xmath107 , it vanishes .",
    "but in figure ( [ nem ] ) the decrease in spectrum with respect to @xmath96 is less than the figure ( [ nem1 ] ) .",
    "so we would have valuable content of spectrum , even in case of a little transition of the incidental fields .",
    "but at all , if we are going to detect the created particles , we would increase our chance by considering one of the medium as a conductor .    in the case @xmath101 and @xmath108 the spectrum was the same as the spectrum of dynamical casimir effect which has been studied by a variety of methods @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite such as robin boundary condition@xcite .",
