    "systems coupled to multiple energy reservoirs , sustaining net transport currents , are prevalent in nature but fall outside the fundamentally well - understood paradigms of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the characterization and classification of such systems , starting from simple microscopic models , remains a key problem of current research . since steady states in such systems",
    "constitute the closest relatives of equilibrium ( gibbs ) states , their study has attracted much recent attention @xcite , revealing a wealth of unexpected phenomena , even in simple model systems .",
    "one of the prime , and most elementary , examples of this kind is a system of hard - core particles undergoing biased diffusion . with appropriate boundary conditions , this system , also known as",
    "the simple asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite , can exhibit a number of surprising features , including anomalous diffusion @xcite , long - range spatial correlations @xcite , and shocks @xcite . one of its key characteristics is the breaking of the usual fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .    in the following , we will discuss the effect of long - range correlated noise on this model , formulated via a langevin equation in continuous space and time .",
    "generated , for example , by correlated fluctuations in the strength of the bias , the additional operator acts in the one - dimensional subspace ( labelled *  * `` longitudinal '' ) selected by the bias .",
    "its momentum dependence takes the form @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "the two extreme values , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are of particular interest .",
    "the choice @xmath4 corresponds to the standard asep .",
    "in contrast , @xmath5 leads to a langevin equation with _ non - conserved _ noise , describing biased diffusion of particles which can occasionally be created or annihilated . first introduced by hwa and kardar @xcite as a continuum description for sliding avalanches in sandpile models , it was analyzed in more detail by becker and janssen @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of the correlated noise term is that it allows us to capture the _ crossover _ between these two models , characterized , respectively , by conserved and non - conserved noise .",
    "thus , using field theoretic techniques , we discuss the full renormalization group ( rg ) flow in @xmath6 space , for @xmath7 . while the limit @xmath8 presents no difficulties , the opposite limit @xmath9 is far more subtle : we will see that , just below the upper critical dimension @xmath10 , _ two _ nontrivial renormalizations are required to render the @xmath4 theory finite , in contrast to a _",
    "one if @xmath11 is positive and of @xmath12 , leading to an apparent discontinuity in the critical exponents .",
    "a similar situation arises in standard @xmath13-theory with long - ranged interactions @xcite .",
    "there , however , the discontinuity is entirely spurious and can be removed : letting @xmath14 denote the distance from the upper critical dimension of the short - range theory , the key is to recognize @xcite that there is a region of _ small _ @xmath15 , where a careful analysis of the rg flow reveals a smooth crossover between the @xmath4 and the @xmath16 theories .",
    "thus , all universal scaling properties are shown to depend continuously on @xmath11 and @xmath17 . here",
    ", in contrast , the limit @xmath18 is even more intricate : while the short - range theory is controlled by two fixed points , only a single one remains in the long - range model .",
    "thus , only one of the two short - range fixed points is smoothly connected to the long - range fixed point , leading to a continuous crossover .",
    "the other short - range fixed point eventually loses its stability , accompanied by a discontinuity in critical exponents .    a second feature of our model concerns its close relationship to the kpz @xcite or burgers @xcite equation with correlated noise @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the continuum description for the asep and the noisy burgers equation coincide in one spatial dimension .",
    "in contrast to the burgers equation , the @xmath19-expansion for biased diffusion around @xmath20 presents no difficulties , and numerous results can be obtained exactly , to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "these may therefore be analytically continued to @xmath21 and are expected to hold for both , the asep and the kpz equation . in fact , to the extent that exact solutions @xcite are available , this expectation is indeed confirmed .",
    "thus , our analysis bears some relation to the behavior of the one - dimensional burgers equation with correlated noise .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the langevin equation for the `` short - range '' ( sr ) version of our model , corresponding to the usual @xmath17-dimensional asep with translational invariance .",
    "we then add a second noise term with long - range spatial correlations and propose two possible microscopic mechanisms for such a term . turning to the rg analysis",
    ", we first summarize the sr case , @xmath4 .",
    "the `` long - range ''  ( lr ) theory associated with @xmath22 is presented next , and the limit @xmath8 is discussed .",
    "finally , we introduce the `` hybrid '' model , characterized by @xmath15 , which interpolates between the sr ( @xmath4 ) and lr ( @xmath22 ) theories .",
    "its rg flow is computed in a double expansion , where both @xmath23 and @xmath19 are small parameters .",
    "the different fixed points are interpreted and their stability is evaluated , illustrating how the subtle crossover from @xmath4 to @xmath22 occurs . we conclude with some comments and open questions .",
    "we consider a @xmath17-dimensional system of hard - core particles , which are allowed to diffuse on a regular lattice with fully periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the bias , reminiscent of an electric field @xmath24 acting on charges , favors particle moves along a specific ( `` longitudinal '' ) direction along unit vector @xmath25 .",
    "the long - time , long - wavelength properties of this model are most conveniently captured by a coarse - grained description in continuous space and time . here , only a single slow variable is needed , namely , the local particle density @xmath26 .",
    "since the associated langevin equation has been discussed previously @xcite , we describe it only briefly here . due to particle number conservation",
    ", it takes the form of a continuity equation , @xmath27 .",
    "in addition to a diffusive term , the current @xmath28 contains an ohmic contribution , @xmath29 , induced by the bias , and a gaussian noise term , modelling the fast degrees of freedom . by virtue of the excluded volume constraint ,",
    "the conductivity @xmath30 must vanish with both particle and hole density , i.e. , @xmath31 . aiming for a perturbation expansion around a field with zero average",
    ", we introduce the deviations @xmath32 from the average density @xmath33",
    ". a term linear in @xmath34 , arising from the expansion of @xmath30 , can be absorbed via a galilei transformation .",
    "finally , we allow for anisotropies in the diffusion coefficient and the correlations of the langevin noise , since the bias singles out a preferred direction . neglecting contributions that are irrelevant in the long - wavelength , long - time limit",
    ", the langevin equation can be summarized in the form @xcite : @xmath35 here , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) denote the gradients in the transverse ( longitudinal ) subspace , and the kinetic coefficient @xmath38 defines a time scale .",
    "the coupling @xmath39 captures the effects of the drive .",
    "the noise @xmath40 is gaussian so that two moments suffice to characterize its full distribution ( after a suitable rescaling of the variables ) :    @xmath41    the differential operator @xmath42 in the second moment ensures that the conservation law is strictly obeyed .",
    "clearly , the correlations described by this form are purely local , so that we will refer to eqns .",
    "( [ le],[srn ] ) as the `` short - range '' ( sr ) theory .",
    "its universal properties have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the simplest way of introducing a correlated noise into this equation is to _ add _ a long - range correlated noise to the local one .",
    "thus , eqn .",
    "( [ srn ] ) is amended to @xmath43 \\delta \\left ( { \\bf r}-{\\bf r}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\delta \\left ( t - t^{\\prime } \\right ) .",
    "\\label{lrn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the new operator @xmath44 reflects a power - law decay of the noise correlations in real space , giving rise to a @xmath45 momentum dependence in fourier space .",
    "clearly , setting @xmath11 to zero reproduces the sr theory , albeit with @xmath46 replaced by @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast , choosing @xmath5 generates a non - conserved noise , playing the role of a random source term in eqn .",
    "( [ le ] ) .",
    "note that the vanishing of the first moment ensures that the particle density , while not strictly invariant under the dynamics , remains conserved _ on average_. the long - time , long - wavelength behavior of this theory has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "other choices of long - ranged noise correlations are of course possible @xcite .",
    "the version adopted above is `` minimal '' in the sense that , first , it leads to a nontrivial , renormalizable theory , and second , it allows us to discuss the full crossover between the conserved ( @xmath4 ) and non - conserved ( @xmath48 ) cases using just one additional operator .",
    "microscopically , such long - ranged contributions to the langevin noise can be generated in two ways : one option is to impose a bias which consists of a spatially uniform and a locally random component , with the latter controlled by a distribution with long - range correlations .",
    "alternatively , one can retain the strictly uniform bias but randomly add or remove particles , according to a long - ranged distribution .",
    "more details will be presented in @xcite .    due to the presence of the nonlinearity , the computation of averages over the noise distribution requires a perturbative approach , coupled with renormalization group methods . for these purposes ,",
    "it is most convenient to recast the langevin equations as dynamic functionals @xcite . introducing a martin - siggia - rose @xcite response field @xmath49",
    ", we can recast eqns .",
    "( [ le],[lrn ] ) in the form @xmath50 & = & \\int dt\\int d^{d}r\\left\\ { \\tilde{s}% \\partial _ { t}s-\\lambda \\tilde{s}\\left [ \\left ( \\nabla _ { \\bot } ^{2}+\\rho \\partial ^{2}\\right ) s+\\frac{g}{2}\\partial s^{2}\\right ] \\right .",

    "we stress that the sr model is recovered from this general expression , simply by setting @xmath52 .    as a first step towards the rg analysis of this model , we discuss its scaling symmetries .",
    "first , under a global rescaling of all coordinates , @xmath53 , we find a scale invariant theory *  * ( as long as we neglect any cutoff - dependence ) provided @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56*. * moreover , we obtain @xmath57 which allows us to identify the upper critical dimension @xmath58 . to avoid confusion , we will reserve the symbol @xmath19 for the sr case , i.e. , @xmath59 . for the general case ,",
    "we define @xmath60 .",
    "second , we may rescale the parallel coordinate alone , due to the anisotropy of the model : under @xmath61 , scale invariance is retained if @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this permits us to identify a set of _ effective _ couplings , namely , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "these will emerge quite naturally in perturbation theory , combined with appropriate powers of @xmath71 which absorb the remaining momentum dependence . for convenience ,",
    "a geometric factor @xmath72 , with @xmath73 the surface of the @xmath17-dimensional unit sphere , has been absorbed into @xmath74 . for later reference",
    ", we note that only the positive octant @xmath75 and @xmath76 corresponds to physical theories even though the rg flow can be discussed in a larger parameter space .",
    "finally , the dynamic functional ( [ df ] ) exhibits a nontrivial continuous symmetry , with parameter @xmath77 , which is characterized by the `` galilean '' transformation @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "so far , we were able to consider the case of general @xmath7 .",
    "the next section will show , however , that this procedure can not be continued for the actual perturbative calculation of correlation and response functions .",
    "we now turn to perturbation theory , with the goal of identifying those correlation and response functions that require renormalization , due to the presence of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences in feynman diagrams . as usual , we focus on the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) vertex functions with @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) external @xmath82- ( @xmath34- ) legs , @xmath83 .",
    "these will be computed in dimensional regularization using minimal subtraction . since the models associated with @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been discussed previously ( in @xcite and @xcite , respectively )",
    ", we only briefly summarize their rg structure , focusing predominantly on the theory with @xmath84 .",
    "we first review the model with @xmath4 @xcite . here ,",
    "the coupling @xmath85 and the effective @xmath86 are redundant and will be set to zero .",
    "the upper critical dimension is @xmath87 .",
    "straightforward dimensional analysis shows that there are three naively divergent vertex functions : @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . a ward identity based on the `` galilean '' symmetry shows , however , that @xmath90 requires no additional renormalization once @xmath91 and @xmath89",
    "have been rendered finite . letting the superscript @xmath92denote bare couplings ,",
    "the renormalized couplings are defined in the usual way : @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 . the parameter @xmath71 sets a typical momentum scale which will control the rg flow .",
    "all sr functions are marked with an explicit superscript to distinguish them from their finite @xmath11 counterparts .",
    "the uv divergences in @xmath91 and @xmath89 give rise to nontrivial @xmath97-factors for @xmath98 and @xmath46 , which can be computed perturbatively in @xmath74 .",
    "a one - loop calculation yields @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath101 is _ not _ treated perturbatively here ; therefore , @xmath102 fixed points for @xmath101 should not come as a surprise later .",
    "finally , @xmath103 to all orders in @xmath74 , due to the `` galilean '' invariance . to complete the discussion",
    ", we introduce the wilson functions @xmath104 the rg flow is expressed through the @xmath71-dependence of the renormalized couplings @xmath68 and @xmath105 , especially in the scaling limit @xmath106 : @xmath107 u ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\beta _ { w}^{sr}\\left ( u , w\\right ) & \\equiv & \\left",

    "are exact to all orders .",
    "these flow equations possess three fixed points , marked by the vanishing of both @xmath108 and @xmath109 : ( i ) @xmath110 , @xmath111 ; ( ii ) @xmath112 , @xmath113 ; ( iii ) @xmath114 , @xmath115 ; and finally a fixed line ( iv ) @xmath116 , with arbitrary @xmath101 .",
    "the stability of these fixed points ( and line ) can be expressed through the @xmath117 matrix @xmath118 , @xmath119 , of derivatives of the @xmath120-functions , evaluated at the fixed points .",
    "we find that the fixed line ( iv ) is stable only for @xmath121 , i.e. , @xmath122 , and will therefore be labelled a `` gaussian '' line .",
    "focusing on @xmath123 , we find that ( i ) and ( ii ) are both locally stable .",
    "fixed point ( iii ) is hyperbolic and sits on the separatrix @xmath124 which separates the domains of attraction of ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "flow lines starting in the region @xmath125 are attracted towards fixed point ( i ) , and vice versa .",
    "we refer to fixed point ( i ) as the fdt - restoring short - range fixed point , since theories with @xmath126 can be shown to possess a higher degree of symmetry , associated with satisfying the fdt @xcite . here ,",
    "( [ srbf ] ) allows us to compute the fixed point values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 exactly , to all orders in @xmath19 : @xmath129 .",
    "conversely , fixed point ( ii ) violates the fdt , and @xmath130 ; @xmath131 are known only perturbatively .    finally , we comment briefly on the scaling properties associated with these fixed points @xcite , which arise from the rg equations for the vertex functions .",
    "for example , the dynamic density correlation function ( structure factor ) @xmath132 scales as @xmath133 this reflects the emergence of anomalous diffusion , characterized , near fixed point ( i ) , by a strong anisotropy exponent @xcite @xmath134 , and , near fixed point ( ii ) by an exponent @xmath135 .",
    "next , we turn to the case of finite @xmath11 .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , we will have to distinguish between values of @xmath11 which are @xmath136 versus those which are @xmath137 . here , we analyze the second case , which corresponds to true long - range ( lr ) theories .",
    "the first case , being a `` hybrid '' between short - range and long - range models , will be deferred to the next subsection .",
    "recalling our discussion in section 2 , the critical dimension is now @xmath58 , and we define @xmath138 , to be distinguished from @xmath96 .",
    "the operator @xmath139 is clearly irrelevant compared to @xmath140 and may be dropped .",
    "the naive dimensions of the fields @xmath34 and @xmath82 are @xmath11-dependent , and as a result only _ two _ vertex functions , namely @xmath91 and @xmath141 , are naively divergent .",
    "in contrast to the short - range case , @xmath142 is naively convergent here .",
    "moreover , all divergent contributions to any vertex function are polynomial in the momenta @xcite , so that @xmath143 is not renormalized .",
    "the `` galilean '' invariance still holds , so that @xmath90 , and hence @xmath144 , requires no new @xmath97-factor .",
    "thus , defining renormalized couplings according to @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , we find @xmath148 to all orders , and @xmath149 , to first order in @xmath150 .",
    "the latter is the appropriate effective coupling here , since @xmath46 no longer appears in the theory .",
    "the coefficient @xmath151 controls the one - loop divergence in @xmath91 .",

    ", the value of @xmath157 is again known to all orders in @xmath158 , namely , @xmath159 .",
    "the scaling properties of the long - range models are again easily derived from an rg equation for the vertex functions . for comparison with the sr case ,",
    "we quote the result for the dynamic structure factor : @xmath160 once again , we observe anomalous diffusion ; here , however , it is controlled by the lr exponent @xmath161 .",
    "it is obvious at this point that the limit @xmath18 , taken in the wilson function ( [ lrwf ] ) or the correlation function ( [ lrs ] ) , will not restore the sr theory .",
    "first , @xmath162 which reproduces only the @xmath163 component of @xmath127 .",
    "second , this naive limit can not generate a non - vanishing @xmath128 which plays a key role in the sr theory .",
    "thus , not surprisingly , we do not observe a smooth crossover from the sr to the lr theory , by simply letting @xmath11 tend to zero in this naive fashion .",
    "an elegant way of dealing with this difficulty was suggested in @xcite : by treating @xmath11 as a small parameter of @xmath164 and expanding in both @xmath19 and @xmath23 , one can `` magnify '' the small @xmath11-section of @xmath165 space and resolve the crossover between the sr and lr fixed points . concerning the scaling form of the structure factor , the prefactor @xmath166 originates entirely in the bare dimensions of the fields . since these are well defined under a naive @xmath9 limit ( cf .",
    "section 2 ) and remain unrenormalized , we have @xmath167 without further complications .",
    "the exponent @xmath168 , however , must be tracked much more carefully .    before turning to these subtleties , we briefly consider the other limit , @xmath169 .",
    "first , we summarize the @xmath5 theory @xcite , with @xmath170 , in its own right . here , @xmath143 measures the strength of the ( non - conserved ) noise .",
    "the effective coupling is @xmath171 . according to @xcite ,",
    "there is only one nontrivial @xmath97-factor , namely @xmath172 .",
    "again , @xmath173 to all orders .",
    "thus , the theories with @xmath5 and @xmath174 exhibit the same set of uv divergences . from the preceding discussion",
    ", it is therefore clear that we may anticipate a smooth crossover here .",
    "this is explicitly confirmed by the results of @xcite for @xmath5 : two fixed points @xmath154 and @xmath175 are found , stable above and below @xmath176 , respectively . at the nontrivial fixed point , @xmath177 takes the exact value @xmath178 .",
    "it is easy to check that this agrees with the @xmath179 limit of eqns .",
    "( [ lrwf]-[lrs ] ) , so that this limit is continuous .      finally , we turn to the analysis of the key region in @xmath180 space , namely , @xmath15 .",
    "the naive @xmath181 limit presupposes @xmath182 , and hence fails to resolve the crossover between the sr and lr theories which occurs for @xmath15 . with both @xmath11 and @xmath183 small , we follow @xcite and analyze the general dynamic functional , eqn .",
    "( [ df ] ) , near the upper critical dimension of the sr theory , i.e. , @xmath184 . both couplings @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath143 will be retained , and their rg flow will be studied .",
    "we refer to this model as the `` hybrid '' theory , since it contains the vital elements of _ both _ sr and lr cases .",
    "thus , the hybrid theory will exhibit a well - defined @xmath18 limit .",
    "once again , we will be able to obtain a number of results to all orders in @xmath185 .",
    "our first task will be to identify a set of suitable couplings which allow us to interpolate between the sr and the lr theories .",
    "guided by @xcite , we consider the general structure of the wilson functions in the sr and the hybrid model .",
    "the appropriate effective couplings will be those that map those functions onto one another .    to obtain a general form for the wilson functions ,",
    "we begin with the @xmath97-factors and construct them order by order in perturbation theory . focusing on the sr theory first , a typical graph of @xmath91 , at @xmath186-loop , contains @xmath187 vertices , @xmath186 ( bare ) correlators and @xmath188 ( bare ) propagators .",
    "each vertex carries a factor of @xmath189 , and each correlator contributes a factor @xmath190 , where @xmath191 denote the frequency and momentum of the corresponding line .",

    "higher order poles appear also , of course , but cancel in the wilson functions and need not be considered for this reason .",
    "generic @xmath186-loop graphs of @xmath89 have a similar structure , with @xmath200 correlators and @xmath201 propagators , and the coefficients of the lowest order @xmath19-poles will be denoted by @xmath202 here .",
    "collecting , we obtain the @xmath97-factors in the general form : @xmath203 the general form of the wilson functions is easily found from the above : @xmath204    next , we consider the hybrid case .",
    "two key differences emerge : first , each correlator now contributes a factor of @xmath205 to a given diagram .",
    "this product gives rise to a sum of individual terms each of which contains @xmath206 factors of type @xmath207 and @xmath81 factors of type @xmath208 , with @xmath209 .",
    "second , since @xmath11 is now of @xmath210 , the poles in these individual contributions are proportional to @xmath211 @xcite . following the same reasoning as above , and recalling the effective coupling @xmath70 ,",
    "one finds quite readily that @xmath212 here , @xmath213 and @xmath214 are the numerical coefficients of each pole . in minimal subtraction , they are independent of both @xmath19 and @xmath23 , since the latter is also @xmath215 here .",

    "this line mediates the stability loss of fixed point ( i )",
    ".    the crossover scenario between the sr and the true lr theory can now be summarized .",
    "let us fix @xmath17 just below @xmath192 and increase @xmath11 starting from zero .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath283 , the rg flow is dominated by the sr behavior .",
    "the sr fixed points ( i ) and ( ii ) are stable , within their respective domains of attraction .",
    "the separatrix forms a surface which cuts the @xmath284 plane at @xmath285 and then bends over to larger values of @xmath281 as @xmath86 increases .",
    "the unstable lr fixed point ( vi ) is found on the separatrix , in the unphysical region @xmath286 .",
    "when @xmath11 reaches @xmath249 , the correlated noise begins to make its presence felt .",
    "specifically , for @xmath287 , the fdt violating fixed point ( ii ) is the only globally stable fixed point .",
    "the fdt restoring fixed point ( i ) , while still stable _ within _ the @xmath284 plane , has become unstable to small perturbations _ out _ of that plane .",
    "thus , a flow line starting near ( i ) , with a small @xmath288 component , will first flow out into the half - space @xmath288 and then bend _ back _ towards @xmath284 , flowing into the fdt violating fixed point ( ii ) .",
    "the _ sign _ of @xmath86 remains invariant under the flow .",
    "the lr fixed point ( vi ) is still unphysical , but has moved closer to the @xmath284 plane .",
    "finally , at @xmath289 @xmath254 , ( vi ) merges with ( ii ) and moves out into the positive @xmath86 region as @xmath11 increases beyond @xmath254 . the lr fixed point ( vi )",
    "is now the only stable one , and the global rg flow is dominated by the lr theory .",
    "a different view of the sr - lr crossover is presented in fig . 1 which shows the location of the stability boundaries as functions of @xmath11 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is interesting to note the two different scenarios which control the stability loss of fixed points here .",
    "fixed points ( ii ) and ( vi ) exchange their stability by merging , similar to the stability exchange between the gaussian and the wilson - fisher @xcite fixed points in @xmath13-theory when @xmath17 drops below @xmath290 .",
    "in contrast , fixed point ( i ) loses its stability , at @xmath291 , by generating a _ fixed line_. this fixed line has two key properties : first , it connects fixed points ( i ) , ( iii ) and ( vi ) ; second , it lies on the surface forming the _ separatrix _ between fixed points ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "this surface bends back towards the @xmath284 plane , as @xmath23 increases , to the extent that it _ reaches _ fixed point ( i ) at @xmath292 .",
    "thus , fixed point ( i ) loses one of its three stable directions when being absorbed by the separatrix ; moreover , this direction is now spanned by the fixed line : this allows the flow to change sign when @xmath23 crosses @xmath249 .    the crossover which we observe in the flow diagrams is also reflected by the exponents . as an example , we consider the scaling form of the lr structure factor , eqn .",
    "( [ lrs ] ) .",
    "we recall that its scaling behavior is determined by the exponent @xmath293 . the hybrid fixed point ( vi ) , on the other hand",
    ", generates an exponent @xmath294 .",
    "these two exponents clearly match , since @xmath295 .",
    "as @xmath11 decreases , we reach the stability boundary @xmath296 , where ( vi ) and ( ii ) exchange stability . here , the exponent associated with ( ii ) is @xmath297 , to be compared with the corresponding value near ( vi ) , @xmath298 . in this way , continuity is ensured .",
    "however , a discontinuous change of exponents may occur as @xmath11 decreases below @xmath249 : above @xmath249 , all positive @xmath237 fall into the domain of attraction of fixed point ( ii ) , with @xmath299 ; in contrast , below @xmath249 , some of these will be attracted towards fixed point ( i ) where @xmath300 . for these theories ,",
    "the strong anisotropy exponent @xmath301 will change _ discontinuously _ upon crossing the stability boundary between fixed points ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "note , however , that @xmath300 coincides with @xmath293 at the line @xmath302 to all orders in @xmath19 . nevertheless , even though the exponents may undergo discontinuities , both the hybrid and the sr structure factors scale according to eqn .",
    "( [ srs ] ) .",
    "thus , the scaling _",
    "forms _ remain unchanged .",
    "using field theoretic methods , we have analyzed the rg flow for a model of biased diffusion subject to a noise term , parameterized by its momentum dependence , @xmath303 , with spatially long - ranged correlations .",
    "one limit , @xmath4 , corresponds to a `` short - range '' model with purely local , conserved noise , and the other , @xmath5 , models biased diffusion with a non - conserved noise .",
    "the crossover from @xmath304 to @xmath5 presents no difficulties ; however , the opposite limit , @xmath181 , is quite subtle . here",
    ", the full crossover is observed only if we interpose a hybrid model with @xmath305 , between the sr ( @xmath4 ) and the lr ( @xmath11 finite ) theories .",
    "this hybrid contains the key elements of both , sr and lr , langevin equations .",
    "it possesses a number of fixed points , including the equivalents of the sr and the lr models , so that the crossover can be understood in terms of a stability exchange between different fixed points .",
    "clearly , considering @xmath11 on the scale of @xmath19 enables us to resolve this `` fine structure '' . just below two dimensions ,",
    "the scenario is following : for @xmath11 below a lower stability limit @xmath249 , the theory is controlled by two stable sr fixed points , one fdt  restoring and the other fdt violating , each with its own basin of attraction .",
    "stated differently , we are in a `` weak noise '' regime , for @xmath306 , where the long - ranged noise does not significantly modify the universal behavior of the system . as @xmath11 increases beyond @xmath249 but remains below an upper stability limit @xmath307 , the sr fdt restoring fixed point becomes unstable , leaving the sr fdt violating fixed point in control of the flow .",
    "this stability exchange is mediated by a fixed point line . finally , above @xmath254",
    ", the sr  fdt violating fixed point also destabilizes and the nontrivial lr fixed point becomes globally stable .",
    "we note , in conclusion , that a similar mechanism , namely stability exchange through a fixed point line , has previously been observed in the sine - gordon model : there , two fixed points are stable below @xmath308 , corresponding to the high- and low - temperature phases , respectively .",
    "as @xmath17 increases beyond @xmath192 , the high - temperature fixed point loses its stability , via a similar fixed point line @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , most of the nontrivial crossover phenomena discussed here are confined to dimensions @xmath309 @xmath192 . above @xmath184 ,",
    "the long - range noise dominates , either via its nontrivial or its gaussian fixed point . in one dimension ,",
    "on the other hand , there is no transverse subspace so that the sr  fdt violating fixed point can not be accessed .",
    "consequently , the scenario described above must change significantly .",
    "it is conceivable that only the lower stability limit might survive here or that the two stability limits merge , leaving us with a stability exchange between the fdt restoring sr and the lr fixed point . since , at @xmath291 , @xmath310 to all orders , this may be a reasonable conjecture .",
    "moreover , in @xmath21 , we have @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "these values agree with the corresponding results @xcite for the one - dimensional kpz equation with correlated noise where only one stability limit is observed .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis plays the role of a pilot study for a number of other interesting problems .",
    "clearly , one might consider an interacting theory subject to an external bias @xcite and a long - range noise term @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath313 , so that physical dimensions are more accessible , and comparisons with monte carlo simulations can be made .",
    "other questions of interest concern noise terms with different spatial correlations , or nontrivial correlations in time . for equilibrium systems ,",
    "the existence of an underlying hamiltonian ensures that these correlations have no effect on static properties . for non - equilibrium",
    "steady states , however , the static behavior is generically inseparable from the dynamics .",
    "studies of anomalous noise correlations in non - equilibrium systems may help to unravel the nature of this coupling .",
