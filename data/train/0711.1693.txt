    "the investigation of transport phenomena in metals is very significant since we can extract a large amount of important information with regard to the electronic states of metals . in conventional metals with weak electron - electron correlation",
    ", various transport phenomena are governed by a single parameter , namely , the quasiparticle relaxation time @xmath0 .",
    "that is , the rta holds well in such conventional metals @xcite .",
    "for example , resistivity @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath7 , which is proportional to @xmath8 in conventional fermi liquids .",
    "the hall coefficient @xmath9 is independent of @xmath0 , and @xmath10 expresses the approximate carrier density @xmath11 .",
    "the magnetoresistance @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "the thermoelectric power @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath15 for a wide range of temperatures .",
    "the signs of @xmath9 and @xmath14 represent the type of carrier ( i.e. , electrons or holes ) .",
    "the behaviors of these transport coefficients , which are referred to as fermi liquid behaviors , are well explained by the rta .    in strongly correlated electron systems ,",
    "however , transport coefficients frequently exhibit a prominent deviation from conventional fermi liquid behaviors . because of this , it is difficult to obtain information on the electronic states from the transport phenomena .",
    "for example , in high-@xmath1 superconductors ( htscs ) , both @xmath9 and @xmath16 are very sensitive to temperature ; in some compounds , sign changes occur with changes in the temperature @xcite .",
    "evidently , a simple rta does not work well for htscs .",
    "for example , @xmath10 is considerably greater than the electron density in optimally doped or under - doped systems .",
    "prominent `` non - fermi - liquid - like behaviors '' are also observed in other strongly correlated systems such as organic superconductors @xcite and heavy - fermion systems ( @xmath17-electron systems ) @xcite .",
    "although these behaviors reveal essential information about the electronic states , only a little was understood about them for a long time . to obtain a significant amount of information from these wealth of treasures , we had to develop the theory of transport phenomena in strongly correlated fermi liquids .",
    "the main objective of the present study is to investigate the non - fermi - liquid - like transport properties in htscs , which have been intensively studied as one of the central issues of htsc . thus far , two different kinds of theoretical models have been actively investigated : in the first kind of models , non - fermi - liquid ground states are assumed .",
    "for example , anderson proposed that the elementary excitations are described by spinons and holons .",
    "it is considered that holons , whose density is small in under - doped systems , are responsible for the anomalous transport @xcite . in the second kind of models , fermi - liquid ground states are assumed .",
    "for example , transport coefficients were calculated based on the nearly antiferromagnetic ( af ) fermi liquid picture @xcite . in the previous studies ,",
    "the rta has been frequently used @xcite . however , both these models can explain only a limited number of experimental facts involved in htsc : many other anomalous transport properties remain unsolved . to understand the true ground state of htsc , it is highly desirable to solve the issue of anomalous transport phenomena in htscs in a unified way .",
    "the main aim of the present study is to explain that the _ rich variety of anomalous transport phenomena observed in htscs can be understood in a unified way in terms of the fermi liquid picture_. for this purpose , we have to take the cvc into account correctly , which is totally dropped in the rta . in interacting electron systems ,",
    "an excited electron induces other particle - hole excitations by collisions .",
    "the cvc represents the induced current due to these particle - hole excitations .",
    "the cvc is closely related to the momentum conservation law , which is mathematically described using the ward identity @xcite . in fact , landau proved the existence of the cvc , which is called backflow in the phenomenological fermi liquid theory , as a natural consequence of the conservation law @xcite .",
    "the cvc can be significant in strongly correlated fermi liquids owing to strong electron - electron scattering .",
    "however , its effect on the transport phenomena has not been studied well until recently .    in the present study",
    ", we discuss the role of cvc in nearly af fermi liquids , such as htscs , organic metals , and heavy - fermion systems near the magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "for example , the rta for the highly anisotropic @xmath18 model can not explain the transport anomaly in htsc . we find that _ the rta is unreliable in the presence of strong af fluctuations , because the prominently developed cvc entirely modifies the rta results _ @xcite . in a fermi liquid , the transport coefficients are described by the total current @xmath19 , which is expressed as a sum of quasiparticle velocity @xmath20 and cvc @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we find that the _ @xmath19 in nearly af metals shows anomalous @xmath21-dependence due to the cvc .",
    "_ this is the origin of the transport anomalies in nearly af metals .",
    "based on the microscopic fermi liquid theory , we investigate the important role of the cvc in @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath14 , and the nernst coefficient ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "furthermore , we confirm this idea by performing a numerical study based on the flex+cvc theory . in this approximation",
    ", the coulomb interaction @xmath23 is the only fitting parameter .    to demonstrate the physical meaning of cvc",
    ", we discuss the scattering processes between quasiparticles in an isotropic model @xcite . in the rta",
    ", it is assumed that the conductivity due to a quasiparticle at @xmath21 is proportional to the mean free path @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath25 in a fermi liquid @xcite , the resistivity according to the rta  @xmath26  is finite .",
    "however , this result is _ not true _ since the momentum conservation law ensures that @xmath27 in a spherical model in the absence of the umklapp process @xcite .",
    "the failure of the rta originates from the assumption that the velocity of the excited quasiparticle disappears after scattering . here",
    ", we explain that the correct answer ( zero resistivity ) in the absence of the umklapp processes is recovered by considering all the relevant normal scattering process as shown in fig .",

    "the cvc represents the current conveyed by the particles at ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) and a hole at @xmath30 , which emerge during the scattering process .",
    "_ therefore , the momentum and energy conservation laws , which are violated in the rta , are restored by considering the cvc @xcite .",
    "the cvc is necessary to reproduce the zero - resistivity in the absence of the umklapp process .    in the rta",
    ", we consider an excited quasiparticle at @xmath21 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : cvc - sp ] ) as if it _ annihilates _ after the relaxation time .",
    "since the rta allows such an unphysical process , the conservation law @xmath31 is violated in the rta .",

    "in later sections , we find that the cvc is significant in nearly af metals : we explain that the cvc is the origin of a variety of anomalous transport phenomena in such metals .    .",
    "after the relaxation time @xmath0 , the quasiparticle at @xmath21 collides with another quasiparticle at @xmath30 in the fermi sea . as a result of this collision ,",
    "the two quasiparticles at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and a quasi - hole at @xmath30 are created .",
    "the total momentum is conserved in this process . ]      in htscs , almost all the transport phenomena deviate from the conventional fermi liquid behaviors , which are referred to as the non - fermi liquid behaviors @xcite .",
    "these anomalous transport phenomena have been studied intensively as one of the most important issues in htscs , since they offer important clues to reveal the true ground state in htscs , which has been unsolved until now . to answer this question ,",
    "many analytical and numerical studies have been performed to determine the ground state of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems .",
    "for example , anderson et al . considered that the ground state of a square - lattice hubbard model is the resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) state , where spin and charge degrees of freedom are separated @xcite . in the rvb state ,",

    "at the same time , @xmath9 starts to increase .",
    "below @xmath34 ( in the pseudo - gap region ) , the af fluctuations are suppressed since the strong sc fluctuations reduce the density of states at the fermi level , which is called the pseudo - gap .",
    "in this study , the filling area is @xmath35 . ]    on the other hand , the fermi liquid theory has been developed and applied to analyzing the htscs , considering that the fermi liquid ground state is realized @xcite . by using the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory , moriya , takahashi and ueda explained that the correct superconducting ( sc ) order parameter @xmath36 as well as @xmath15-linear resistivity are derived from the strong af fluctuations @xcite .",
    "based on the phenomenological spin fluctuation model , monthoux and pines performed a quantitative analysis for optimally - doped ybco @xcite .",
    "further , bickers et al . studied the square - lattice hubbard model according to a self - consistent random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) , which is now called the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite .",
    "these spin fluctuation theories have succeeded in reproducing various non - fermi - liquid behaviors in the normal state of htscs : for example , temperature dependence of nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate given by nmr / nqr measurements , @xmath37 , is reproduced well . moreover , famous @xmath15-linear resistivity in htsc , @xmath38 is also explained .",

    "we shortly discuss the absence of the multiband effect on the kw relation : in a usual heavy - fermion compound , there are one or two ( relatively ) large fermi surfaces composed of heavy quasiparticles , and several ( relatively ) small fermi surfaces composed of light - quasiparticles . in the presence impurities , @xmath1345 as explained in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rho - imp ] ) . therefore ,",
    "heavy quasiparticles on the large fermi surfaces give the dominant contribution to both the specific heat and the @xmath1170-term . as a result",
    ", the grand - kw relation is universally realized even in multiband systems .",
    "moreover , in many heavy - fermions , there is evidence that the heavy quasiparticles on the large fermi surfaces give the dominant contribution to the conductivity .",
    "for example , @xmath1346 seems to be realized in many heavy - fermions away from af - qcps , although @xmath1347 should be realized when small fermi surfaces are the most conductive .",
    "figure [ fig : gkw ] ( ii ) shows the mid - infrared peak energies @xmath1309 of the optical conductivity @xmath731 in various heavy - fermion systems @xcite . according to the fermi liquid theory , @xmath1348 is satisfied in the pam , where @xmath522 is the @xmath282-@xmath17 mixing potential and @xmath1349 is the mass enhancement factor .",
    "okamura confirmed that the relation @xmath1350 is universally satisfied in various heavy - fermion compounds , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkw ] ( ii ) .",
    "this scaling relation is well satisfied regardless of @xmath1307 .",
    "their study established the validity of the pam and the fermi liquid theory in various heavy - fermion compounds .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> in this paper , we present a recent developments in the theory of transport phenomena based on the fermi liquid theory . in conventional metals , various transport coefficients are scaled according to the quasiparticles relaxation time , @xmath0 , which implies that the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) holds well . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a simple scaling does not hold in many strongly correlated electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> the most famous example would be high-@xmath1 superconductors ( htscs ) , where almost all the transport coefficients exhibit a significant deviation from the rta results . </S>",
    "<S> this issue has been one of the most significant unresolved problems in htscs for a long time . </S>",
    "<S> similar anomalous transport phenomena have been observed in metals near their antiferromagnetic ( af ) quantum critical point ( qcp ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of this study is to demonstrate whether the anomalous transport phenomena in htsc is the evidence of non - fermi liquid ground state , or it is just the rta violation in strongly correlated fermi liquids . </S>",
    "<S> another goal is to establish a unified theory of anomalous transport phenomena in metals with strong magnetic fluctuations . for these purposes , </S>",
    "<S> we develop a method for calculating various transport coefficients beyond the rta by employing field theoretical techniques .    in a fermi liquid </S>",
    "<S> , an excited quasiparticle induces other excited quasiparticles by collision , and current due to these excitations is called a current vertex correction ( cvc ) . </S>",
    "<S> landau had noticed the existence of cvc first , which is indispensable for calculating transport coefficient in accord with the conservation laws . here , we develop a transport theory involving resistivity and hall coefficient on the basis of the microscopic fermi liquid theory , by considering the cvc . in nearly af fermi liquids , we find that the strong backward scattering due to af fluctuations induces the cvc with prominent momentum dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this feature of the cvc can account for the significant enhancements in the hall coefficient , magnetoresistance , thermoelectric power , and nernst coefficient in nearly af metals . according to the present numerical study , aspects of anomalous transport phenomena in htsc </S>",
    "<S> are explained _ in a unified way _ by considering the cvc , without introducing any fitting parameters ; this strongly supports the idea that htscs are fermi liquids with strong af fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> further , the present theory also explains very similar anomalous transport phenomena occurring in ce@xmath2in@xmath3 ( @xmath2=co or rh ) , which is a heavy - fermion system near the af qcp , and in the organic superconductor @xmath4-(bedt - ttf ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the striking @xmath5-dependence of the ac hall coefficient and the remarkable effects of impurities on the transport coefficients in htscs appear to fit naturally into the present theory . </S>",
    "<S> many aspects of the present theory are in accord with the anomalous transport phenomena in htscs , organic superconductors , and heavy - fermion systems near their af qcps . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some of the open questions for future work . </S>"
