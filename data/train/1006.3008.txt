    "( [ gammadouble2 ] ) .",

    "3 .   minimising spontaneous emission from the excited electronic state @xmath8 of the trapped particle .",
    "this is important , when it comes for example to the cooling of molecules , where such an emission might populate states , where the particle no longer experiences the cooling laser .",
    "as pointed out in the previous paragraph , the cooling rate @xmath36 is much higher when @xmath95 is close to @xmath160 . as a consequence , the restrictions which need to be posed on the minimum size of the single particle cooperativity parameter @xmath35 are therefore much weaker in this case .",

    "this paper analyses cavity cooling of a trapped particle with ground state @xmath7 and excited state @xmath8 in the parameter regime , where the phonon frequency @xmath1 and the cavity decay rate @xmath0 are both relatively large . as shown in figure [ setup ] , we assume that the motion of the particle orthogonal to the cavity axis , i.e.  in the direction of the cooling laser , is strongly confined .",
    "the aim of the cooling process is to minimise the number of phonons in this vibrational mode .",
    "the role of the cooling laser is to establish a coupling between the phonons and the electronic states of the trapped particle .",
    "the result is the continuous conversion of phonons into cavity photons which subsequently leak into the environment .",
    "the finite temperature limit of the cooling process is due to the counter - rotating terms in the system hamiltonian which simultaneously create a phonon and a cavity photon .",
    "we describe the time evolution of the system using the usual master equation .",
    "the main approximations made in the derivation of the master equation are the lamb - dicke approximation , the rotating wave approximation with respect to optical transitions , and the adiabatic elimination of the excited atomic state @xmath8 of the particle .",
    "the second approximation is a standard approximation in quantum optics and in general in very good agreement with experimental findings .",
    "the third approximation requires a sufficiently large detuning @xmath12 of the 01 transition of the particle with respect to the cavity field and the cooling laser ( c.f .",
    "figure [ energy1 ] ) . without further approximations ,",
    "the master equation can then be used to obtain a closed set of differential equations , the cooling equations , which predict the time evolution of the mean phonon number . to calculate the stationary state phonon number , we set the right hand side of the cooling equations equal to zero .",
    "the cooling rate is obtained via an approximate solution of the cooling dynamics with the help of an adiabatic elimination which applies for relatively large @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath168 and is in very good agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "our results show that , in the case of a relatively tightly confined particle inside a relatively leaky optical cavity , the cavity cooling scenario in figure [ setup ] is essentially equivalent to ordinary laser cooling .",
    "this applies , since the mean number of photons inside the cavity remains negligible in the parameter regime considered here .",
    "if the purpose of the cavity is to avoid photon emission from the excited electronic state @xmath8 of the trapped particle , as it might be necessary for the cooling of molecules , the cavity needs to be operated well within the strong coupling regime .",
    "otherwise , the cooling process described here simply becomes a mixture of cavity and ordinary laser cooling .    before concluding this paper we would like to point out that the above results which have also been obtained by other authors are only valid within the lamb - dicke regime .",
    "it is usually believed that the lamb - dicke approximation , i.e.  the expansion of the system hamiltonian as a function of @xmath101 , is well justified for a sufficiently pre - cooled particle .",
    "however , when avoiding this approximation , the methods used in this paper no longer yield a closed set of rate equations . in fact , higher - order terms in @xmath101 which have been neglected here could , in principle , evolve the system in the long term into a state which is very different from the stationary state obtained above @xcite .",
    "when calculating stationary states , a priori assumptions about the existence and the @xmath101-dependence of the stationary state phonon number should be avoided . moreover , going beyond the lamb - dicke regime yields corrections to the cooling rate @xmath36 of the order @xmath117 @xcite .",
