    "@xmath4 this program has only one answer set @xmath5 , and so has @xmath0 and @xmath1 among its consequences . when augmented with the rule  @xmath6 the program gains a second answer set  @xmath7 , and loses consequence  @xmath0 .    a syntactic condition known as",
    "`` order - consistency '' @xcite was shown by fages ( 1994 ) to guarantee consistency of normal programs under the answer set semantics . in this note",
    "we establish that order - consistency guarantees another nice property : cautious monotonicity .",
    "[ cautious monotonicity theorem ] if @xmath2 is an order - consistent program and atom  @xmath0 belongs to every answer set for  @xmath2 , then every answer set for program  @xmath8 is an answer set for  @xmath2 .",
    "all normal programs under the answer set semantics have a property complementary to cautious monotonicity , commonly called `` cut '' : augmenting a program with one of its consequences can not cause it to gain a consequence .",

    "cut and cautious monotonicity together imply another nice property , called `` cumulativity '' : augmenting a program with one of its consequences does not alter its consequences .",

    "we establish in addition that if an atom @xmath0 is a consequence of order - consistent program  @xmath2 , then @xmath0 is a consequence of the corresponding member of each of the families of signed programs .",
    "it follows that adding rule  @xmath11 to  @xmath2 , and so to the corresponding member of each of the families of signed programs , does not affect the answer sets for the members of the families of signed programs .",
