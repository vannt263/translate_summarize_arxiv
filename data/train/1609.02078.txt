    "the possibility of manipulating magnetization by spin - currents in a very efficient way is a key requirement for the design of novel spintronic devices @xcite , which promise to change the way digital information is processed and stored . in particular ,",
    "the advantageous scaling of current - induced spin manipulation compared to the oersted field - induced switching allows for lower power operation at small design rules .",
    "the driving mechanism behind current - induced magnetization dynamics pioneered for use in metallic ferromagnets in the last twenty five years has been the spin - transfer torque @xcite .",
    "however , recently a novel and possibly more efficient approach to current - driven magnetization manipulation has been developed .",
    "in particular , very efficient current - induced spin dynamics has been observed in multilayer systems with an ultra - thin ferromagnetic layer sandwiched between two different non magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "these new current - induced torques originate from spin - orbit effects ( at least one of the two non - magnetic layers consists of an heavy metal ) and so they are referred to as spin - orbit torques ( sots ) @xcite .",
    "two different origins have been suggested for the sots .",
    "one is the spin accumulation induced at the [ heavy metal]@xmath0ferromagnet interface due to the bulk spin - hall effect ( she ) in the heavy metal layer @xcite .",
    "a second possible origin of the sots is the inverse spin - galvanic effect ( isge ) @xcite , which generates a non - equilibrium spin - density at both the top and the bottom interfaces of the ferromagnet .",
    "both effects are expected to induce an effective torque whose strength is a function of the ferromagnetic layer thickness .",

    "chiral domain walls are reported to be very stable against annihilation @xcite and to exhibit interesting transport properties @xcite , thus being very promising for technological applications .",
    "the origin of these chiral spin structures is the interfacial dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) @xcite .",
    "the dmi is expected to primarily originate from the interface between the heavy metal and the ferromagnet , predicting a direct scaling of its effective strength with the inverse of the ferromagnetic layer thickness @xcite . accordingly , both the dmi and the sots are expected to depend strongly on the materials system as well as on the layers thickness .",
    "so , the ferromagnetic layer thickness dependence of dmi and sots is directly linked to their origin . a pure interface - like effect on one side and a more complicated mechanism which includes bulk - like processes on the other",
    "are expected to scale differently with the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer @xcite . in particular , there are predictions that the dmi and the isge can have a common origin , which should result in a similar dependence on the thickness @xcite .",
    "so , studying the sign and amplitude of dmi and sots as a function of the ferromagnetic layer thicknesses is a key necessity to reveal their origins .",
    "+ materials stacks with a strong dmi as well as large sots are particularly promising , due to their rich physics as well as the possibility to be used in novel spintronic devices @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising of those materials stacks is the trilayer pt@xmath0co@xmath0alo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "several manuscripts have reported the characterization of the dmi @xcite and of the sots @xcite in this system .",
    "however , reports from different groups for nominally identical samples have often shown contradicting results possibly originating from different thicknesses and growth conditions and no systematic study has been provided to date . in particular , varying the co thickness is a key challenge as it potentially allows to distinguish between effects from the interface with the pt and the alo@xmath1 and from the bulk of the materials .",

    "accordingly , the spin - hall effect is most probably an important source of both sots measured here , where the weaker fl - field is generated by the precession , around the exchange field , of the itinerant spins diffusing in the ferromagnetic layer @xcite .",

    "indeed , after diffusing across the ferromagnet for a distance equal to the transverse spin - diffusion length , the spin - current is absorbed and no further effect on the magnetization beyond this thickness is produced .",
    "accordingly , in the first spin diffusion length the effective fields build up , then decay with a further increase of the co thickness . while this qualitatively describes the measurements , we can not rule out further origins that would be influenced by an identical effect , resulting in the similar thickness dependence reported here .    ,",

    "these results clearly motivate a theoretical analysis about the comparability of dmi measurements obtained with different experimental techniques .",

    "they observed a larger discrepancy between the two techniques results for materials stacks with a smaller damping factor , suggesting a better agreement for systems with large damping .",
    "however , despite the very large damping factor usually reported for pt@xmath0co@xmath0alo@xmath1 ( @xmath111 @xcite ) we do observe a quantitative discrepancy between the dmi values extracted by cidwm and the ones obtained by bls .",
    "this rules out the small damping as the key factor generating the discrepancy between the cidwm- and the bls - extracted dmi values .",
    "+ a second possible interpretation of such a discrepancy relies on the different type of physical process probed by the two techniques . in the bls measurements",
    "spin waves with wavelengths of hundreds of nanometers are probed on an area of tens of microns ( defined by the laser spot ) @xcite . on the other hand , in cidwm experiments",
    "the object at the center of the study is the dw , whose width is usually @xmath112  nm in pma systems .",
    "accordingly , the dw motion is much more sensitive to the local variations in magnetic properties such as anisotropy , magnetization and dmi due to grain boundaries , interface roughness etc . , while the spin waves probed in the bls measurements are affected by the average values of those physical properties .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested @xcite that pinning sites could be characterized by a weaker dmi compared to the defect - free regions of the sample , which might help to explain the lower dmi probed by the dw compared to thermal magnons . +",
    "a final possible interpretation for the lower dmi extracted by the cidwm study relies on the presence of a non - negligible stt , even though for a related system no significant stt was claimed @xcite .",
    "it is known that the standard stt drives the dw motion along with the electron flow , unless exotic materials properties like a negative non - adiabaticity parameter characterize the system under study .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no experimental observations of a negative non - adiabaticity parameter , in pt@xmath0co@xmath0alo@xmath1 and related systems , has ever been reported so far .",
    "accordingly , the presence of a finite stt would result in the observation of a stopping field that is smaller than the actual dmi field ( as previously reported by torrejon et al .",
    "nevertheless , if this was the main origin of the observed discrepancy , the strength of the stt needed to generate such effect would be @xmath113 times the actual sot s strength .",
    "this would correspond to a @xmath114 underestimation of the actual strength of the sot by the used 1d model calculations . in the scenario of a simple model based on the she - induced sot , where @xmath115 , this would result in the extraction of a max sot efficiency of @xmath116 .",
    "such a large sot efficiency has never been reported before in the study of cidwm , and thus , most likely , this can not explain our results .",
    "so the reported discrepancy between cidwm- and bls - extracted dmi values might be understood if a combination of all the three interpretations reported above is taken into account .",
    "however , it also shows that care needs to be taken when comparing values of the dmi determined by different techniques .",
    "furthermore , this should encourage future comparative studies of different systems using different approaches and in particular theoretically analyze the different probed properties to identify the origin of the discrepancies , which will be reserved for a future study .      when comparing the effective sot - fields ( @xmath81 ) extracted by the ccm on the one side and the @xmath11 technique on the other side , two major observations can be made .",
    "first , the effective fields obtained by the two techniques are of comparable magnitude .",
    "second , while the effective fields extracted by the dw motion study are all contained in a range of values as large as the 25% of the largest extracted value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1dm_sots ] ) , for the effective fields obtained by hall measurements the largest value is 4 times as large as the smallest one ( see black squares in fig .",
    "[ fig_sot - vs - tco ] ) .",
    "furthermore , while the effective field increase with increasing thickness is seen by both techniques , the second harmonics technique detects also a stronger decrease for large thicknesses that is not directly visible in the dw motion results .",
    "+ there may be several possible explanations for the different thickness dependence of the dl - field extracted by the two experiments , and here we discuss two of them .",
    "the first explanation is based on the symmetry of the sots .",
    "it is well known that sots depend on the polar angle ( angle between the magnetic moment and the z - axis ) @xcite , and the thickness dependence of the same sot ( dl - torque in this case ) does not need to be necessarily the same for different polar angles . furthermore",
    ", the magnetic moment in a dw is characterized by a polar angle of 90 deg ( contained in the x - y plane of the sample ) , while the magnetization in the hall measurements is almost collinear to the z - axis ( @xmath20 or @xmath22 state ) .",
    "accordingly , the observed different results obtained by cidwm and @xmath11 measurements can be interpreted as a polar angle - dependent scaling of the dl - field with the ferromagnetic thickness .",
    "a second possible interpretation is based on the different spin structures that are probed in the two experiments . in the dw motion study , the effective sot - field acts on a highly non - collinear spin texture , while in the hall measurements the probed magnetic state is a single domain .",
    "accordingly , the spin - transfer process in the two cases can be different , resulting in the extraction of different effective field amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , the dmi present in this system plays a key role in the dw dynamics @xcite , while it does not affect the current - induced dynamics of the saturated magnetic state .",
    "finally , the 1d - model used to analyze the torques exerted in the domain wall motion is limited by the virtue that it does not capture the evolution of the structure of the domain walls during their motion and this could lead to a limited understanding of the precise magnitude of the torques . in a future work , using independent determination of the damping and more refined modeling might lead to a more quantitative agreement .",
    "+ in conclusion , we observe that the analysis of the results of @xmath11 and dw motion experiments provide us with effective sot - fields that are of similar magnitude . however a detailed correlation between the trend of the effective fields measured by the two methods calls for further investigation , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "a detailed characterization of the thickness dependence of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) and spin - orbit torques ( sots ) in pt@xmath0co(t)@xmath0alo@xmath1 was obtained by mean of two different experimental techniques : current - induced domain wall motion and second - harmonic hall measurements . the sign and strength of the dmi",
    "are extracted by measuring the domain wall motion stopping fields .",
    "a negative dmi , corresponding to the presence of left - handed homo - chiral dws , is observed to decrease in strength with an increasing co thickness .",
    "this confirms that the dmi originates from the pt@xmath0co interface and its measured effective strength decreases for thicker ferromagnetic layers .",
    "the extracted dmi strengths are in agreement with values reported in previous current - induced dw motion studies on similar materials stacks , however they are quantitatively different from the values extracted for the very same sample by brillouin light scattering ( bls ) measurements .",
    "the dmi values presented here are about a factor 3 smaller than the values extracted by bls .",
    "this quantitative disagreement highlights that care has to be taken when comparing the results of the two techniques and the differences possibly originate from the different length scales and physical processes probed in the two experiments . + from the analysis of the dw motion using a collective - coordinates model we extracted the driving sot - field , while the symmetry and magnitude of both damping - like and field - like sot - fields acting on a magnetic single domain state were extracted by @xmath11 hall measurements .",
    "the effective damping - like sot - field driving the dw motion is observed to increase with an increasing ferromagnetic layer thickness up to @xmath117  nm . from the @xmath11 measurements both effective fields acting on the homogeneous spin structure are found to initially increase up to a co thickness of about 1.3 nm , and then to decrease with a further increase of the ferromagnetic thickness .",
    "the differences in the thickness dependence of the effective fields obtained by the two techniques can have different origins : the non - ability of the 1d - model to capture the real dynamics of the dw internal magnetization during its motion , or the different parts of the polar angle dependence of the torques probed in the two experiments .",
    "+ the similar non - monotonic thickness dependence observed for the damping - like and field - like effective fields suggests a possible common origin for the two fields : the spin - hall effect in the pt bottom layer . in this scenario ,",
    "the final effective fields are defined by the transverse spin diffusion length in co , which is expected to be around 1.2 nm .",
    "accordingly , for co thicknesses smaller than the transverse spin diffusion length the effective fields are observed to increase , while for co thicknesses larger than the spin diffusion length the effective fields are observed to decrease .",
    "however , while qualitatively the behavior fits a dominating she origin we can not rule out additional effects that affect the two torques similarly leading to a similar thickness dependence .",
    "finally , the qualitatively different thickness dependence of dmi and sots shows that both effects clearly do not have a common origin in our investigated system .",

    "<S> we report the thickness dependence of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) and spin - orbit torques ( sots ) in pt@xmath0co(t)@xmath0alo@xmath1 , studied by current - induced domain wall ( dw ) motion and second - harmonic experiments . from the dw motion study , </S>",
    "<S> a monotonous decay of the effective dmi strength with an increasing co thickness is observed , in agreement with a dmi originating at the pt@xmath0co interface . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the ferromagnetic thickness dependence of spin - orbit torques reveals a more complex behavior . the effective sot - field driving the dw motion </S>",
    "<S> is found to initially increase and then saturate with an increasing ferromagnetic thickness , while the effective sot - fields acting on a saturated magnetic state exhibit a non - monotonic behavior with increasing co - thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the observed thickness dependence suggests the spin - hall effect in pt as the main origin of the sots , with the measured sot amplitudes resulting from the interplay between the varying thickness and the transverse spin diffusion length of the co layer . </S>"
