    "the fascinating and rich phenomenology of high temperature cuprate superconductors has been very thoroughly studied over the past 20 years .",
    "although there is substantial variability in detail from material to material , all cuprates exhibit robust mott insulator antiferromagnetism when the hole - doping fraction @xmath1 is very small , superconductivity which appears when @xmath1 exceeds a minimum value @xmath4 , and a maximum @xmath5 in optimally doped materials with @xmath6 . in the underdoped regime , the superconducting transition temperature is limited by phase fluctuations@xcite , and experiments hint at a wide variety of ( typically ) short - range correlations associated with competing charge and spin orders .",
    "the underdoped regime poses a fundamental challenge to theory because its electronic properties are not fully consistent with any of the various well - understood _ fixed - point _",
    "behaviors that often help us to classify and predict the properties of very complex materials .",
    "the phenomenological parameter @xmath0 used to characterize phase - fluctuation stiffness in a superconductor is normally expressed in terms of the superfluid density @xmath7 by writing @xmath8 , an identification that is partly justified by bcs mean - field theory .",
    "the increase of @xmath0 with @xmath1 in cuprate superconductors is therefore readily accounted for by theories@xcite in which superconductivity is due to the condensation of cooper pairs formed from holes in a doped mott insulator@xcite .",
    "theories which start with this view must still explain the fact that @xmath0 vanishes at a non - zero value of @xmath1 , and deal with the awkward property that cuprate superconductivity evolves smoothly from the underdoped regime to an overdoped regime in which it appears to be explainable in terms of conventional band - quasiparticle cooper pair condensation .",
    "in this article we propose an alternate explanation for the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath0 based on band - quasiparticle pairing .",
    "our argument accounts for the correlation energy of a d - wave superconductor in the presence of incipient antiferromagnetism and is based on the following general expression for the phase stiffness of a superconductor : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the area of the system , @xmath11 the pairing wavevector@xcite , and @xmath12 is the total energy including both mean - field and correlation contributions : @xmath13 .",
    "the familiar bcs theory expression for @xmath0 captures only the mean - field theory contribution to the energy .",
    "when superconductivity is viewed as a weak - coupling instability of a fermi liquid , it is usually implicitly assumed that @xmath14 is not significantly influenced by the formation of the superconducting condensate , and certainly not by changes in the condensate s pairing momentum @xmath11 . in the case of simple models with parabolic bands and galilean",
    "invariance , neglect of the correlation energy contribution can be justified rigorously .",
    "we argue the correlation energy contribution is significant in underdoped cuprates because there is direct competition between the fermi sea quantum fluctuations which condense in antiferromagnetic and d - wave superconducting states .",
    "consequently the pair - breaking effects of finite @xmath11 , which weaken superconductivity , also increase the importance of antiferromagnetic fluctuations , lowering @xmath14 and decreasing @xmath0 compared to its mean - field value . in the following sections we first use a fully phenomenological and then a partially microscopic extended - hubbard - model weak - coupling theory to expand on this idea .",
    "the conjugate relationship@xcite between pairing and antiferromagnetic fluctuations plays an important role in the fluctuation spectrum and hence in theories of the correlation energy . in our theory of the underdoped state , the resonant magnetic mode ( insr ) observed in inelastic neutron scattering@xcite experiments",
