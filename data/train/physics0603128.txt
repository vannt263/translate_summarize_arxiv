    "to date , all gaseous quantum condensates have been produced by evaporative cooling of confined atoms .",
    "confinement is necessary to thermally isolate the particles from the warmer environment and long confinement times are necessary because the evaporative cooling process can take tens of seconds .",
    "strong magnetic field gradients have been used to confine neutral paramagnetic molecules @xcite and electric - field gradients have been used to confine neutral polar molecules in electrostatic traps @xcite and in toroidal storage rings @xcite . in addition",
    ", polar molecule confinement in a synchrotron storage ring has been modeled @xcite .",
    "all of these methods use molecules or atoms in weak - field - seeking states , whose binding energy decreases in the field .",
    "these states are not the lowest energy state and are therefore subject to collisional relaxation . in alkali atoms , the relaxation rates from the stretched hyperfine levels ( @xmath0 )",
    "but in magnetically trapped paramagnetic molecules @xcite and in electrically confined polar molecules @xcite , the relaxation rate can be large enough to prevent achieving the confinement time needed for evaporative cooling .",
    "collisional relaxation will be absent for polar molecules in their lowest rotational state .",
    "this ground state is strong - field - seeking , as are all rotational states in the limit of strong electric field .",
    "the technical challenges of storing molecules in a strong - field - seeking state have not been previously addressed .",
    "the major challenge is focusing these molecules because electrostatic lenses can focus strong - field - seeking molecules in only one transverse plane while defocusing in the other . therefore alternating - gradient focusing is required .    for experiments on molecules in strong - field - seeking states ,",
    "a storage ring has some useful features not generally found in traps .",
    "the ring has a beam geometry with field - free regions accessible to experiments , and it can simultaneously store many bunches of particles producing a large flux of molecules .    in this paper",
    "we show , by modeling and simulation , that it is feasible to construct a storage ring ( fig.[fig : ringlattice ] ) that will store a symmetric - top molecule ( methyl fluoride ) in the @xmath1 state , at a kinetic energy of 2 k ( 30 m / s ) , and by extension other molecules and velocities . in the storage ring ,",
    "bunching electrodes hold the molecules in a string of short bunches .",
    "the molecules are calculated to be stable against losses due to defocusing , oscillations , and diffusion for over two minutes .",
    "we also model a decelerator for slowing the molecules to 30 m / s , and an injector for loading the storage ring .",
    "a storage ring in which the density of the molecules in a bunch is allowed to vary around the ring , can provide a mechanism for evaporative cooling .",
    "regions of high density speed the thermalization of the molecules . in regions of low density",
    "the molecules can become spatially separated due to their velocity spread allowing the hottest molecules to be removed .",
    "a brief description of focusing and deflecting a beam of molecules using electrostatic multipole fields is given below .",
    "additional details of beam transport and focusing of molecules in strong - field - seeking states , with specific application to methyl fluoride in the @xmath1 state , may be found in kalnins et al .",
    "@xcite .    the guide field in a storage ring for",
    "molecules in strong - field - seeking states must provide all the functions , such as focusing , bending , and bunching , that are used in a ring for charged particles but with forces that arise from gradients of the magnitude of the electric field . in a pure quadrupole or sextupole field , the total electric field increases radially and the force on a molecule , in a strong - field - seeking state ,",
    "is away from the centerline in all transverse directions .",
    "therefore a dipole component must be added to remove the double - defocusing , and obtain focusing in one transverse direction while still defocusing in the other .",
    "the force on a molecule is given by the gradient of its stark potential energy , @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnitude of an external field .",
    "the stark energy of the molecular level is in general a nonlinear function and is described for methyl fluoride in the @xmath1 rotational state in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the limit of large @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the molecule s electric dipole moment .",
    "the transverse ( @xmath7 horizontal , @xmath8 vertical ) electric multipole potential used to bend and focus a molecule is : @xmath9 \\label{eq : potpsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the dipole field strength , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the relative quadrupole and sextupole component strengths .    for the stark energy in the high - field limit , the forces to second order",
    "are : @xmath13\\nonumber",
    "\\\\          f_y&\\rightarrow&d_ee_0[(a_2 ^ 2 - 2a_3)y-(a_2 ^ 3 - 4a_2a_3)xy ] \\label{eq : phixyq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we see that a combined dipole and sextupole ( @xmath12 ) field lens will focus in one plane , while defocusing in the other . to deflect the molecule we must add a quadrupole ( @xmath11 ) component .",
    "this also defocuses the beam in the @xmath8 direction and stronger sextupole ( @xmath12 ) strengths are needed @xcite .    to obtain net focusing in both transverse planes ,",
    "the lenses are arranged in a sequence with gradients alternating in sign ( @xmath14 for @xmath7-focusing and @xmath150 for @xmath8-focusing ) .",
    "when a molecule in a strong - field - seeking state enters the field of an electrode pair it is accelerated longitudinally , and upon exiting the field it is decelerated .",
    "also , the fringing field is stronger away from the midplane and this causes a net defocusing force in the direction of the electric field . between successive sets of electrodes ,",
    "this unwanted defocusing is reduced if the dipole fields are of the same polarity and strength .",
    "longitudinal bunching , as in a charged - particle ring , requires a pulsed field .",
    "the field is ramped in a sawtooth or sine - wave form and the time - dependent acceleration is the net difference between the fields when entering and when exiting .",
    "the effect of gravity is small but not negligible for 30 m / s molecules in this ring .",
    "the vertical orbit will be distorted and an orbit correction must be applied .",
    "the equations of motion of a molecule in the ring are obtained from the hamiltonian : @xmath16 where @xmath2 is the stark energy , g is the acceleration due to gravity , and @xmath17 is the kinetic energy which in a bend region is : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the transverse momenta , @xmath21 is the angular momentum and @xmath22 is the bend radius . in straight sections",
    "the last term is replaced by the square of the longitudinal momentum , @xmath23 .",
    "the longitudinal variation of the stark energy at the ends of electrodes ( treated here as a step function ) adds or subtracts from the kinetic energy , the change in longitudinal velocity being about @xmath2410@xmath25 .",
    "vertical defocusing in a fringe field is derived from the longitudinal variation of the field on the midplane and to lowest order is : @xmath26\\phantom{a}y \\label{eq : edge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the principles and techniques we use apply to all polar molecules in strong - field - seeking states . we choose methyl fluoride ( ch@xmath27f ) as our reference molecule because it is a nearly symmetric rotor with a large electric dipole moment of @xmath6 = @xmath28 c - m ( 1.84 d ) .",
    "it has a moderate rotational constant of @xmath29 @xmath30 and a simple level structure with a @xmath31 rotational ground state .",
    "the rotational constant is large enough to limit the number of rotational levels populated in the beam from a jet - source but still small enough to allow for a large stark effect at moderate electric fields .",
    "methyl fluoride is also a gas at room temperature .",
    "the velocity of 30 m / s ( kinetic energy of about 2k ) is low enough to make for a compact ring , yet keep small the effects of gravity .",
    "long straight regions free of focusing electrodes make the stored beam accessible for experiments and give space for injection and extraction .",
    "molecules , in order to drift through the straight section without loss , must have only small divergences and therefore a large beam width . in a bending region , we need strong deflecting forces to minimize the bend radius for overall compactness .",
    "these strong forces call for a small beam width to avoid nonlinearities . to make the transition ( match ) from straight sections to arc sections , triplets (",
    "q1 , q2 , q3 ) of focusing lenses are placed at the ends of the straight sections , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ringlattice ] .    in each of the eight bend regions , there are five electrode pairs ; each has a combined dipole and quadrupole field to provide the strong deflecting force . to this",
    "is added a sextupole component , the gradient of which alternates in sign .",
    "the electrode parameters are given in table [ table : quadparam ] where q are focusing elements and bf and bd are combined bend and focusing elements .",
    "each arc is a series of bf and bd elements : @xmath32bf+bd+bf+bd+@xmath32bf .    in this sequence of lenses with alternating gradients ,",
    "the molecules execute oscillatory transverse motions .",
    "the parameters of bf and bd are chosen such that the phases of these horizontal and vertical motions each advance through an angle of 2@xmath33 in each octant of arc .",
    "the parameters of q1 , q2 and q3 are varied to find values that produce large dynamic aperture and momentum acceptance .",
    "the decapole coefficient , @xmath34 of q2 , which adds the term @xmath35 to the potential eq([eq : potpsi ] ) , is introduced to reduce the nonlinearity of q2 focusing where the beam is at it s largest . for longitudinal confinement with many short bunches ,",
    "we use eight bunchers in the ring ; each has a short uniform field that is pulsed in time as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dect ] .    molecules with different energies have their closed orbits radially separated in the arcs and perhaps elsewhere in the ring .",
    "if this dispersion of orbits is present at a buncher , the energy change from the buncher produces a shift in the orbit and an increment in the radial oscillation .",
    "this is called synchro - betatron coupling and to avoid growth of radial oscillation amplitude , the dispersion of orbits must be made zero at the bunchers . with the phases of the vertical and horizontal motions advancing through an angle of @xmath36 in each octant , as noted above , the dispersion becomes zero at all eight buncher locations .",
    ".parameters of storage ring electrodes [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      to inject the beam , we need a bend electrode that can pulse on or off in the time between buckets in the ring .",
    "this allows us to store multiple ( up to 203 ) bunches in the ring .",
    "the deflecting electrode ( fig.[fig : ringlattice ] ) is part of a transport line that transforms the pulse leaving the decelerator to match the orientation of the transverse acceptances of the ring at the point of entry onto the closed orbit of the ring .",
    "the deflecting electrode is actually an array of bend electrodes with radius 0.6 m , similar to a bend section in the ring .",
    "a horizontal phase advance of @xmath36 in this bend , avoids a net dispersal of molecules that are within the @xmath37 % velocity spread .    in passage along the line",
    ", the velocity spread of @xmath37% lengthens the bunch and a debuncher at the point of injection ( fig [ fig : ringlattice ] ) brings 90% of the bunch within the @xmath38% longitudinal momentum acceptance of the ring .",
    "we calculate the intensity based upon a pulsed jet source with 1% methyl fluoride seeded in xenon carrier gas , using the equations in miller @xcite and verified against seeded xenon jet source performance reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "xenon s high mass ( 133 ) produces much slower beams ( 310 m / s from a room - temperature reservoir ) than do light carrier gases , resulting in a shorter ( 19.6 m ) decelerator .",
    "the bunch intensity is determined by the source flow rate , the @xmath1 state population , the velocity distribution and the acceptances .",
    "a source orifice of 1 mm diameter and reservoir pressure of @xmath39 pa ( 500 torr ) will produce an intense cold beam with a peak intensity of @xmath40 molecules sr@xmath41 s@xmath41 , a longitudinal velocity spread of 7.2 m / s fwhm , and less than 1% clusters .",
    "we estimate the methyl fluoride j = 0 rotational state fraction to be 30% . in an apparatus with a finite pumping speed ,",
    "this peak intensity is possibly only by using a pulsed jet source operating with a small duty cycle .",
    "the short widely - spaced beam pulses entering the decelerator ( which become more closely spaced after deceleration ) require a duty cycle of less than one percent for a 100 hz pulse rate .",
    "this would allow all 203 buckets in the ring to be filled in 6.4 turns .",
    "the transverse and the longitudinal emittances ( units of m@xmath42 s@xmath41 ) of a bunch of molecules are unchanged in passing through the deceleration process@xcite from the source to their injection in the storage ring .",
    "therefore the fraction of molecules from the source that enters the ring is the product of the ratios of ring acceptances to source emittances . in the transverse directions , the beam from the source has @xmath43 mm spatial extents and @xmath44 mr angular divergences ; then the horizontal and vertical acceptances of the storage ring ( table [ table : mainparam ] ) of 11 mm - mr and 21 mm - mr respectively , result in @xmath45 of the molecules being transversely accepted .",
    "longitudinally , one second of beam from the source is 310 m long and has a velocity spread of @xmath46 m / s .",
    "the storage ring will accept @xmath47 m / s in a 10-mm long bunch , which is @xmath48 of the source longitudinal emittance .",
    "combining these nunbers and acounting for the 90% acceptance of the storage ring from the injector yields an intensity of @xmath49 molecules / bunch .",
    "bunches could be injected into the storage ring singularly or in large numbers . with a maximum of 203 stored bunches",
    "there would be nearly 10@xmath50 molecules circulating in the storage ring and a flux of 2.5 @xmath51 10@xmath50 molecules / s .",
    "each bunch would have a density of about 3 @xmath5210@xmath53 molecules/@xmath54 in the long straight sections , and higher in the bends .",
