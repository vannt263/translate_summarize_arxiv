    "one of the most fundamental problems in the understanding of neural networks is to relate the observed dynamics of a network to its connection structure @xcite .",
    "since networks made of similar elements and interactions , such as our brains , can perform seemingly very different tasks , it is believed that the functions of the network are mainly governed by its connection structure not its constituents . in general , the behavior of a network is governed by the dynamics of its individual elements , their interactions and their connection topology @xcite .",
    "it is straight forward to compute the dynamics of the network when all these three factors are known . however , the reverse problem of reconstructing the structure of the network from its dynamics is highly non - trivial @xcite .",
    "it is possible that different physical connection structures might give rise to similar observed dynamics .",
    "also , the dynamics of a network can be history dependent ( memory ) without any changes in physical connections .",
    "however , since the physical connection of a neural network is usually not available and the network dynamics is the only information one can obtain from a neural network , many studies have been devoted to the studies of network reconstruction from the observed dynamics ; such as cross correlation @xcite , granger causality @xcite , transfer entropy @xcite etc . reconstructing the underlying network connection solely from the measurement of the time - series signal of the elements is in general a difficult task , albeit it can be achieved recently for undirected networks of uniform coupling strengths @xcite or for directed networks with loop - free structure @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes even more challenging for the case of neuronal networks due to the directed synaptic connections and their dynamically dependent plasticity .",
    "one intuitively simple attempt for neuronal network reconstruction is based on repeating spatial temporal firing patterns @xcite of the network . in the concept of cell assembly @xcite , proposed by hebb as a possible mechanism for the realization of higher brain functions from interconnected neurons ,",
    "these repeating spike patterns are believed to be related to the network connection structure of the cell assembly .",

    "temporal firing patterns in cultures and _ in vivo _ experiments . in these studies , the repeating spike patterns are considered fundamental because they represent a dynamical characteristic of the network which should be intimately related to its connection structure . although the relation between these repeating spike patterns and the network structure is still far from clear , one can still `` reconstruct '' network structures from these pattern , if the notion of `` fire together , wire together '' is used . with this heuristic rule , repeating spike patterns obtained from neuronal cultures",

    "since the repeating spike patterns are assumed to have linear connections with only links between adjacent neurons in the spike - time sequence@xcite , this reconstruction method ignores the possibility of `` branching '' in the propagation of spiking activity and could likely predict some connections that were not present in the actual network structure .",

    "from the results obtained above , it is clear that functional networks reconstructed from repeating spike patterns can be quite different from the original physical network .",
    "the major reason is that branching in the propagation of neural activity is ignored in our method of reconstruction @xcite with the `` fire together wire together '' heuristic rule . in our simulations",
    ", branching is actually quite important in all the networks studied here .",
    "this has actually been considered by izhikevich @xcite in the so called polychronization of spiking activity .",
    "therefore , we have adopted a relaxed criteria to assess the correlation between the repeating spike patterns and the nominal network structures based on whether the nodes participated in a repeating spike pattern form a connected subnetwork .",
    "this is the minimal requirement for a spanning tree to exist on the nominal network that connects all the firing nodes of a repeating spike pattern .",
    "we note that , this does not imply that patterns fail to be connected are completely fallacious since some key nodes could have been left out due to numerical error in the template - matching algorithm . in the current study",
    ", we do not further investigate how the nominal network structure underlying a repeating spike pattern can be recovered from the spike pattern itself .",
    "also , we have shown ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pattern - stat ] ) that the effectiveness of using the repeating spike patterns to reconstruct the underlying nominal network structure is strongly dependent on the topology of the underlying network and the operating conditions when the spikes are generated . one major difference between a scale - free network and a random network is the existence of well - connected hubs",
    ". these hubs can play important roles in relaying information and instigate or modulate activities of the system @xcite .",
    "a possible reason for the higher fractions of connected repeating spike patterns found for the scale - free a and intermediate b networks is that the high degree of connectivity for these hubs helps the repeating spike patterns they participated in form connected subnetworks of the systems .      to verify this hypothesis , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction - of - detected ] the mean fractions of a node s occurrences in repeating spike patterns that form connected subnetworks versus the degree of the node",
    ". it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction - of - detected ] that patterns of a node with higher degree are more likely to be connected and the highly connected hub nodes in networks a and b are indeed responsible for the high fractions of connected patterns . for larger background current",
    ", there exists a degree threshold @xmath103 above which , all patterns participated by such a node are connected .",
    "such threshold is not clearly evident for lower background current where the synaptic weights are stronger to compensate the lower excitability of neurons .    in our simulations , we find that some of the repeating spike patterns can be embedded into other repeating spike patterns ; especially those with short sequence lengths .",
    "that is , these repeating spike patterns are subsequences of other repeating spike patterns .",
    "these repeating spike patterns are defined as core patterns in @xcite and are thought to be more relevant to the underlying structure of the network .",
    "however , we find that in a typically simulations , less than 10% of all the detected repeating spike patterns are core patterns by the criteria in @xcite and only a small number of nodes in the network will take part in these core patterns ; especially for network c and d @xcite . if we apply our analysis by using core patterns , nodes participated in the core patterns do have a higher fraction to be connected except for the random network d , and the break down to node degree also shows sharper transitions than those shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fraction - of - detected ] for core patterns @xcite .",
    "it is still not clear whether the repeating spike patterns or the core patterns are better suited for network reconstruction .",
    "presumably , the core patterns are controlled by the core nodes which are likely the hubs in the network while almost all nodes in the network can participate in the repeating spike patterns as long as excitation ( noise ) in the system is strong enough . in this aspect",
    ", the repeating spike patterns should be more relevant in providing information for the reconstruction of the network topology .",
    "the effects of hubs on functional reconstruction can also be seen in the intermediate networks .",
    "the network b in fig .",
    "[ fig : different - network - structures ] represents an intermediate case between scale - free network with power - law tail in the degree distribution and a more uniformly connected network with gaussian degree distribution .",
    "while there are still a number of hub neurons in such a network , their degrees are limited comparing to the case of scale - free network .",
    "consequently , unlike the scale - free network , all neurons can stop firing during the resting period of its dynamics .",
    "we see clear reverberatory bursts in the mid range of background current @xmath104 @xmath94a @xcite . applying the template - matching method , the spiking dynamics of such a network produces the largest numbers of repeating spike patterns in all conditions studied here .",
    "similar to scale - free network a , the number of connected patterns increases consistently with an increase of background current .",
    "still , only a small fraction of the patterns are actually connected sequentially following their spike times .",
    "the picture emerges from our simulations is that although the functional network reconstructed from repeating spike patterns can be quite different from the underlying physical network and even the degree distribution recovered can be quite different , the repeating - spike - pattern method can be effective in identifying hubs when hubs exist .",
    "since the form of reverberations are quite different for networks with and without hubs ( fig  [ fig : comparison - of - bursting ] ) , the form of reverberations together with the reconstruction by repeating spike patterns might provide a reliable method to detect hubs in the neuronal cultures .",
    "in the current setup , the characteristics of detected repeating spike patterns in the small - world network @xmath11 seem to well interpolate that of the geometrically constrained network c and random network d. the low fractions of connected patterns can be correlated with the absence of hubs in these networks following the discussion above .",
    "there is a steady increase in the number of detected patterns as a geometrically constrained network becomes more random by rewiring .",
    "however , the number of these patterns that form connected subnetworks of the underlying nominal network actually becomes less as more links are rewired . while the rewired long links introduce more possibilities for activity propagation , hence more patterns , the neighborhood , cluster structure for a geometrically constrained network can make it more likely for an identified repeating spike pattern to be connected .",
    "we note that for the networks of 100 neurons in the current study , the difference in path lengths is very limited for typical consideration of small - world networks . while our results provide a hint on what can be expected , to properly address the small - world effect in repeating spike patterns of simulated neuron networks , significant computing resources need to be invested to consider networks of higher orders of magnitudes in sizes .",
    "since functional networks reconstructed from repeating spike patterns are governed by both the topology and dynamics of the network and their excitations are the outcome of collective dynamics of the system , perhaps the functional network structure is more relevant to the concept of cell assembly . in fact , hebb @xcite had used the phrase `` functional unit '' when he referred to connections in a cell assembly . in this sense , the repeating spike patterns provide a convenient way to look at the complexity of the system .",
    "while their correspondence to the underlying structure of the network can be complicated by various factors as we have shown in the current study , they are perhaps more relevant to the functional dynamics of the network that might serve to fulfill certain biological purposes .",
    "the situation is somewhat similar to relating the gene expression in a cell with the primary structure of its dna sequence .",
    "recently , a novel method @xcite based on covariance and time delay is used to extract the functional connection between different astrocytes during the propagation of @xmath105 waves induced by an external stimulation . however , this method probably can not be applied to the case of spontaneous reverberations studied here because in order for the method in @xcite to work , special constrains are introduced for the network reconstruction .",
    "these constrains are related to single source of stimulation and the directional nature of the @xmath105 wave propagation ( time delay ) . in the case of spontaneous reverberations ,",
    "both of these features are absent . in this work ,",
    "we studied only spontaneous network dynamics .",
    "similar methods of pattern matching have been used successfully in the identification of functional unit by using evoked activities . in our current study ,",
    "the excitations for the networks are provided by noise .",
    "if some of the nodes in the nominal networks are used as inputs , our simulation method can also be used to study the repeating spike patterns in evoked activities .",
