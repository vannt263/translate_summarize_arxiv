    "many susy studies rely on computer codes that calculate the mass spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the couplings , branching ratios , _ etc .",
    "_ , from given sets of model parameters . for the lhc ,",
    "for instance , many simulations are done for particular benchmark scenarios or by mapping the @xmath1 parameter plane . for such studies",
    "it is certainly important wheather a particular decay channel is open or not and what branching ratio it has . also , theoretically or experimentally excluded regions depend on the details of the spectrum .",
    "studies for an @xmath2 linear collider deal , in addition , with high precision measurements of ( s)particle properties , with the determination of the underlying susy breaking parameters , their extrapolation to the gut scale , model destinction , _",
    "etc_. experimental accuracies of the per - cent or even per - mille level are expected .",
    "it is thus clear that we need theoretical predictions of a precision comparable to the experimental accuracy .",
    "however , it has been noticed @xcite that different programs can give quite different results for the same set of input parameters .    in this article",
    ", we compare the mass spectrum calculations of four public codes : isajet7.63  @xcite , suspect2.005  @xcite , softsusy1.4  @xcite , and spheno1.0  @xcite , in the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) framework .",
    "we discuss the renormalization group ( rg ) running and the implementation of radiative corrections , concentrating on the parameter regions where the largest differences are encountered : large @xmath0 and large @xmath3 .",
    "an overview of which corrections are implemented in each of the four programs is given in table  1 .",
    "large @xmath0 has always been recognized as a difficult case since it requires a thorough treatement of the bottom yukawa coupling @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that @xmath4 gets large @xmath0 enhanced corrections from susy loops , the dominant contributions coming from @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchanges .",
    "these generate a @xmath7 coupling , which is forbidden at tree - level , @xmath8 .",
    "this modifies the tree - level relation between the bottom mass and yukawa coupling , @xmath9 with @xmath10 . in the programs under discussion",
    "this is taken into account as @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the  bottom mass in the standard model and @xmath13 contains the susy - loop corrections .",
    "the complete 1-loop expression for @xmath14 is given in @xcite .. ] compared to the naive 1-loop expansion @xmath15 , eq .",
    "makes a numerical difference of about @xmath16 in @xmath4 and about 1030% in @xmath17 for large @xmath0 .",
    "the re - summation of susy threshold corrections @xcite will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "although all four programs now apply eq .  , some numerical differences in @xmath4 remain .",
    "these are partly due to differences in @xmath18 : suspect , softsusy and spheno calculate @xmath18 in the  scheme , isajet uses the @xmath19 value .",
    "another reason is that isajet uses @xmath20 for the expression @xmath21 in eq .  , while the other programs use @xmath22 or the bottom pole mass ; also the gluino masses differ by about 5% . moreover , the vacuum expectation values @xmath23 are not running in isajet .",
    "the bottom yukawa coupling has its largest effect in the higgs sector .",
    "shows the running of @xmath24 for @xmath25  gev , @xmath26  gev , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the two cases @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "as one can see , there is good agreement for not too large @xmath0 .",
    "however , for @xmath30 , quite different results are obtained for @xmath31 , whose evolution is driven by @xmath4 : @xmath32 note in particular the dotted line which shows the result obtained with isajet7.58 . in this version , the susy corrections to @xmath4",

    "the self energies of @xmath38 and @xmath39 have been neglected in eq .  .",
    "we note that including only the tadpoles from the third generation is in general a good approximation .",
    "the remaining 1-loop contributions account for a @xmath40 correction .",
    "shows the higgs boson masses obtained by the four programs as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the new isajet version 7.63 has led to a majer improvement compared to the situation discussed in @xcite ( the results obtained by isajet7.58 are again shown as dotted lines in ) . for @xmath17 and @xmath41 there is now agreement within @xmath42 up to @xmath43 .",
    "sources for the remaining differences are pointed out above .",

    "a discrepancy of @xmath45  gev is too large compared to the expected experimental accuracy .",
    "this discrepancy is mainly due to the different radiative corrections taken into account for the ( @xmath46 ) system .",
    "they vary between 1- and 2-loop , effective potential and diagramatic calculations , see table  1 . given the expected experimental accuracy for @xmath44 it is clear that the best available calculation should be used .",
