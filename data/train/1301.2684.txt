    "transitions from one kind of collective behavior to another are named shape phase transition .",

    "they are different from thermal phase transitions which occur as a function of temperature .",
    "this implies changes in the shape of the nucleus .",
    "the control parameter is the number of nucleons . in the last decade , many researchers have given insights into the evolution of structure of nuclei ( in particular transitional regions of rapid change )  @xcite .",
    "they have used the concepts of qpts , phase coexistence and the critical - point symmetries ( cps )  @xcite proposed by iachello , as well as a raft of geometrical models  @xcite .",
    "+ theoretically , qpts have been mostly studied in the interacting boson model ( ibm ) .",

    "the u(5 ) , su(3 ) and o(6 ) dynamical symmetries correspond to the shape phase of a spheroid , axially prolate rotor and @xmath0soft rotor , respectively  @xcite . using the model ,",
    "the authors pointed out that second order shape phase transition occurs between u(5 ) and o(6 ) while first order shape phase transition occurs between o(6 ) and su(3 )  @xcite .",
    "more recently , iachello has pointed out that the properties of nuclei lying at the critical - point of a shape phase transition can be described by special solutions of the bohr hamiltonian , called as critical - point symmetries .",
    "the e(5 ) critical - point symmetry  @xcite corresponds to the second order critical - point between u(5 ) and o(6 ) , while the x(5 ) critical - point symmetry  @xcite corresponds to the first order transition between u(5 ) and su(3 ) .",
    "experimentally , the e(5 ) and x(5 ) symmetry has been realized in the spectrum of @xmath4ba  @xcite and @xmath5sm  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the introduction of critical - point symmetries e(5 ) and x(5 ) , and their experimental realizations have triggered many works on quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "+ in spite of the fact that the ibm and the solutions of bohr hamiltonian are useful for determining shape phase transitions in nuclei , mean field formalisms ( e.g. , hfb method  @xcite and relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model  @xcite ) which provide a correct prediction of many nuclear phenomena have been successfully used to study the shape phase transition in nuclei .",
    "the rmf theory has been used to investigate the critical - point nuclei in even@xmath1even sm  @xcite and ce  @xcite isotopes . in these studies , @xmath6sm and @xmath7ce have been suggested as an example of the possible critical - point nuclei with x(5 ) symmetry . beside , ti isotopes have been examined in the hfb method  @xcite and rmf model  @xcite to investigate the critical - point nuclei . in these studies , @xmath8ti and @xmath9ti have been found as to be the possible candidate critical - point nuclei with e(5 ) symmetry in the rmf model and hfb method , respectively .",
