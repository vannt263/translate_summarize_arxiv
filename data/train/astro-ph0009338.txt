    "the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) is well known .",
    "yet why it works is not clear . a dizzying variety of distinct interpretations",
    "have been offered over the years ( e.g. , aaronson , mould , & huchra 1979 ; milgrom 1983 ; walker 1999 ) .",
    "there is no consensus even when the context is limited to that of nfw halos widely divergent pictures have been offered , sometimes in successive papers by the same authors ( e.g. , dalcanton , spergel , & summers 1995 , 1997 ; van den bosch & dalcanton 2000 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; mo & mao 2000 ; steinmetz & navarro 1999 , navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) .",
    "it is commonly _ assumed _ that mass scales with some power of rotation velocity , and that luminosity traces mass .",
    "the first piece of this common wisdom is questionable given the startling lack of dependence of the tf relation on surface brightness ( sprayberry et al .",
    "1995 ; zwaan et al .",
    "it matters not at all whether the luminous mass is concentrated or diffuse .",
    "this is commonly interpreted to mean that the mass in stars is insignificant .",
    "if stellar mass contributes noticeably to the rotation velocity , @xmath0 surely demands _ some _ shift ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; courteau & rix 1999 ) .    whether luminosity traces mass is a more tractable issue .",
    "i address this here in an empirical way using data which span the largest available dynamic range .",
    "this at least makes clear that the fundamental relation which needs explaining is one between _ rotation velocity _ and _ disk mass _ ( mcgaugh et al .",
    "implicit in our presumption that light traces mass is the relation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the baryon fraction of the universe , @xmath3 is the fraction of the baryons associated with a particular galaxy which reside in the disk , @xmath4 is the fraction of disk baryons in the form of stars , and @xmath5 is the mass - to - light ratio of the stars . each of the pieces which intervene between @xmath6 and @xmath7 must be a nearly universal constant shared by all disks , or a finely tuned function of rotation velocity , in order to maintain the observed tf relation .",
    "we can improve on equation ( 1 ) by using the observed gas mass to correct for @xmath4 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the tf relation works in bright galaxies because they are star dominated : @xmath8 .",
    "this breaks down as one examines lower mass galaxies which are progressively more gas dominated ( mcgaugh & de blok 1997 ) . yet",
    "if we add in the gas mass , the tf relation is restored ( fig .",
    "a number of inferences can be drawn from this simple result :    * disk mass is the fundamental quantity of interest .",
    "* stars got mass ! * stars and gas account for nearly all of the disk mass . *",
    "the product @xmath9 is constant .",
    "items ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are just sanity requirements .",
    "if there were another substantial reservoir of baryons in the disk besides the observed stars and gas , then there should be some signature of its absence like that seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) & ( b ) where an important component has been ignored .",
    "similarly , the modest scatter in the tf relation only follows if @xmath3 is a constant , which only happens naturally if @xmath10 ( mcgaugh et al .",
    "one could consider @xmath11 as long as some mechanism maintained it as a universal constant , or even made it a fine - tuned function of @xmath12 .",
    "such a situation is highly contrived ( van den bosch & dalcanton 2000 ) .",
    "the baryonic tf relation between disk mass and rotation velocity can be expressed as @xmath13 a fit to the data ( @xmath14 ) in fig .",
    "1(c ) has a slope indistinguishable from @xmath15 with normalization @xmath16 .",
    "this line is drawn in each panel of fig .  1 .",
    "the greatest source of uncertainty is the mass - to - light ratios of the stars , which must be assumed .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratios assumed in fig .",
    "1(c ) were normalized to the mean of the dynamically determined @xmath17-band maximum disk values for high surface brightness galaxies ( verheijen 1997 ) with colors from stellar population models of de jong ( 1996 ) .",
    "these models also give the same @xmath18 , consistent with that of the milky way ( gerhard , these proceedings ) and the results of sanders & verheijen ( 1998 ) .",
    "requiring continuity in the present relation provides an interesting constraint : stars must have significant mass to avoid the discontinuity apparent in fig .",
    "1(b ) & ( d ) .",
    "such mass - to - light ratios are plausible in terms of both dynamics and stellar populations .",
    "however , this contradicts the much lower mass - to - light ratios needed for rotation curve fits with nfw halos and the observed lack of shift with surface brightness in the tf relation itself .",
    "the tully - fisher relation appears to be a manifestation of a more fundamental relation between disk mass and rotation velocity ( see also de jong & bell , these proceedings ) .",
    "this relation is now observed to span over 4 decades in mass , twice what can be found in most tf studies . that the tf relation continues to hold over such a large range , despite the reversal of dominance of gas at the low masses to stars at the high masses ,",
    "is a tribute to its fundamental importance for understanding disk galaxies .",
    "just why there should be a relation of the form @xmath19 remains open to debate .",
    "i am grateful to my collaborators , jim schombert , greg bothun , and erwin de blok for all their many contributions .",
    "i also thank ken freeman , stephanie cot , eric bell , and roelof de jong for stimulating conversations on this topic .",
