    "understanding how the processing of information in neural media is influenced by the biophysical processes that take place at the synaptic level is an open question . in particular ,",
    "the effect of synaptic dynamics and noise on complex functions such as associative memory is not yet well understood . in relation to this",
    ", it has been reported that short term synaptic plasticity has a main role in the ability of some systems to exhibit switching between stored memories.@xcite the same behavior ensues assuming dynamics of the neuron threshold to fire.@xcite the origin of the switching mechanism seems in both cases at a sort of fatigue of the postsynaptic neuron under repeated presynaptic simulation .",
    "this destabilizes the current attractor which may result in a transition to a new attractor .",
    "it would be interesting to put this on a more general perspective concerning the role of noise in associative memory tasks . with this aim , we present in this paper a _ stochastic neural automata _ that involves two independent competing dynamics , one for neurons and the other for synapses .",
    "consider @xmath0 ( binary ) neuron variables , @xmath1 , any two of them linked by synapses of intensity @xmath2 ; @xmath3 .",
    "the interest is on the configurations @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in order to have a well  defined reference",
    ", we assume that interactions are determined by the hopfield _ energy _ function .",
    "furthermore , consistent with the observation that memory is a global dynamic phenomenon , we take the model dynamics determined at each time step by a single pattern , say @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , @xmath7 with @xmath8 and assuming the hebbian learning rule , for example , @xmath9 , where , @xmath10 are the variables that characterize the @xmath11 pattern , one out of the @xmath12 _ memorized _ ones , and @xmath13 is a proportionality constant . therefore , each configuration @xmath14 is unambiguously associated to a single @xmath11 , and we write @xmath15 in the following .",
    "the above may be formulated by stating that the probability of any configuration @xmath16 evolves in discrete time according to @xmath17 p_{t}(\\mathbf{s^{\\prime } } , \\mu ^{\\prime } ) , \\label{discrete_master_equation}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 $ ] represents the probability of jumping from @xmath19 to @xmath16 .",
    "we explicitly consider here the case in which @xmath20 = t_{0}^{\\mu ^{\\prime } } [ \\mathbf{s } | \\mathbf{s^{\\prime } } ] \\times t_{1}^{\\mathbf{s } } [ \\mu   | \\mu ^{\\prime } ] \\label{probability_of_jumping}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 $ ] corresponding to _ little dynamics _ ,",
    "i.e. , parallel updating , so that @xmath22= \\prod_{i=1}^{n}t_{0}^{\\mu^{\\prime } } [ s^{\\prime } , i]$ ] . furthermore , @xmath23",
    "\\equiv \\psi [ \\beta _ { 0}\\delta h^{\\mu^{\\prime } } ( s_{i}^{\\prime } \\rightarrow s_{i}= \\pm s_{i}^{\\prime } ) ] $ ] , where @xmath24 is an arbitrary function , except that it is taken to satisfy _ detailed balance _ ( see ref.@xcite for a discussion ) , @xmath25 is an ( inverse ) temperature parameter , and @xmath26 denotes the _ energy _ change brought about by the indicated transition . for changes in the synapses ,",
    "we take @xmath27=\\psi [ \\beta _ { 1 } \\delta h^{\\mathbf{s}}(\\mu ^{\\prime } \\rightarrow \\mu ) ] $ ] .",
    "we also take @xmath28 = 1 $ ] for any @xmath19 . after some algebra",
    ", one has that @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 is the overlap between the current state @xmath32 and pattern @xmath11 .",
    "the factor @xmath0 in @xmath33 appears because we assume _ global _ energy variations ( i.e. , all synapses in the configuration are attempted to be changed at each step ) instead of the energy variation per site in @xmath34 .",
    "this model differs essentially from apparently close proposals , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "first , because it assumes the same time scale for changes in both @xmath32 and @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the choice here for @xmath35 $ ] amounts to drive neurons activity and synaptic intensities by different temperature , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the case of our model with a single pattern is equivalent to the equilibrium hopfield model with @xmath38 ; for more than one pattern , however , new nonequilibrium steady states ensue .",
    "this is closely due to the fact that @xmath39 $ ] does not satisfy detailed balance.@xcite    in principle , one may estimate from ( [ discrete_master_equation ] ) how any observable @xmath40 evolves in time .",
    "the result is an equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the set of control parameters and @xmath43 denotes statistical average with @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite alternatively , one may be directly concerned with the time evolution for the probability of jumping in terms of the overlaps @xmath45 .",
    "one has that @xmath46p_{t+1}(\\mathbf{s},\\mu ) $ ] satisfies @xmath47 \\,\\pi _ { t}(\\mathbf{m^{\\prime } } , \\mu ^{\\prime } ) .",
    "\\label{effective_master_equation}\\ ] ]    this amounts to reduce the degrees of freedom , from a number of order @xmath48 in @xmath16 to @xmath49 in @xmath50 dealing with this sort of coarse  grained master equation requires an explicit expression for @xmath51 $ ] which we take as @xcite @xmath52   \\mathcal{k}\\int d \\mathbf{q}\\exp [ n\\phi ( \\beta _ { 0},\\mathbf{m},\\mathbf{m^{\\prime } } , \\mathbf{q},\\mu ^{\\prime } ) ] $ ] . here",
    ", @xmath53 is a constant , and @xmath54 is the conjugated momentum of @xmath55 .",
    "hence , @xmath6 and @xmath55 evolve separately in time .",
    "changes in @xmath6 , given @xmath56 , are controlled by @xmath57 $ ] , while @xmath56 evolves according to the term @xmath58 $ ] with a fixed @xmath59 .",
    "a justification of this equation and a detailed study of its consequences will be reported elsewhere.@xcite",
    "here we report on some preliminary results of a monte carlo study of this model which reveals an intriguing situation .",
    "different regimes are shown in figure @xmath60 ( _ left _ ) depending on the values of temperatures @xmath61 and @xmath62 . to distinguish between them ,",
    "we introduce the overlap ( @xmath63 ) and the total number of jumps ( @xmath64 ) ; three regimes occur that are close to the ones reported in @xcite .",
    "there is an oscillatory phase which is illustrated in figure @xmath60 ( _ right _ ) .",
    "the system in this case has associative memory , like in hopfield model .",
    "however , this is here a dynamic process , in the sense that the system trapped in any attractor corresponding with a pattern is able to jump to the other stored patterns . because the probability of jumping depends on the neurons activity , this mechanism is , in general , a complex process .",
    "one might argue that these jumps are a finite size effect ; it does not seem to be the case , however .",
    "similar jumping phenomena , apparently independent of the size of the system,@xcite have already been described in kinetic ising  like models in which disorder is homogeneous in space and varies with time , and mean  field solutions also exhibit these phenomena .",
    "some finite  size effects are evident , however ; the synaptic temperature , for instance , scales with size .",
    "in fact , we obtain @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; consequently , we redefine @xmath68 from now on .    a series of our computer experiments concerned @xmath69 and @xmath70 in order to study in detail the oscillatory phase , it turned out convenient to look at time correlations . therefore , we used correlated patterns , namely , there was an average overlap of 20% between any two of the stored patterns .",
    "the goal was to detect non  trivial correlations between jumps , so that we computed the time @xmath71 the system _ remains _ in pattern @xmath72 before jumping to pattern @xmath73 @xmath74 is the total time the system stays in pattern @xmath75 this reveals the existence of two different kinds of oscillatory behavior .",
    "one is such that @xmath76 independent of @xmath72 and @xmath77 that is , the system stays the same time at each pattern , so that jumping behaves as a completely random process , without any time correlation .",
    "this is denoted by _",
    "o(ii ) _ in figure @xmath60 ( _ left _ ) .",
    "even more interesting is phase _ o(i)_. as the probability of jumping between patterns is activity dependent , lowering @xmath61 leads to non ",
    "trivial time correlations , namely , @xmath71 depends on both @xmath72 and @xmath78 we also observe that @xmath71 differs from @xmath79 .",
    "this peculiar behavior suggests one that some spatial temporal information may be coded in phase _",
    "o(i ) _ .    in order to understand further these two different jumping mechanisms",
    ", we simulated for @xmath80 , in units of @xmath81 at fixed @xmath82 the resulting probability distribution of time @xmath83 averaged over @xmath84 @xmath85 is shown in figure @xmath86 .",
    "the data fit @xmath87 this predicts that @xmath88 which compared with our simulations gives relative errors of @xmath89 for @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the error increases with @xmath61 because the overlaps then tend to become too small and jumps are , consequently , not so well - defined .",
    "also interesting is the average of time @xmath90 before jumping , because diverging of @xmath91 indicates that the overlap is stable and no jumps occur .",
    "the _ trial _ distribution above gives @xmath92 therefore , @xmath93 , which also enters the probability normalization as @xmath94 , indicates whether there are jumps @xmath95 or not @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath93 measures the jumping frequency .",
    "it is also worth studying the tails of the distributions for large events .",
    "this is illustrated in figure @xmath86 ( _ inset _ ) .",
    "one may argue that , as in ref.@xcite for somewhat related phenomena , this tail is due to the superposition of many exponentials , each corresponding to a well  defined type of jumping event .",
    "we are presently studying this possibility in detail ."
