    "large - spin systems have a finite but comparatively large number of quantum states .",
    "therefore a single system can be used to study a broad range of phenomena , from purely quantum to semiclassical where the spin behaves almost like a classical top .",
    "one of the interesting features of large - spin systems is that , in a strong static magnetic field , their energy levels become almost equidistant , with level spacing close to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the larmor frequency . as a result ,",
    "radiation at frequency @xmath2 is resonant simultaneously for many interlevel transitions .",
    "this leads to new quantum and classical nonlinear resonant effects .",
    "an important class of large - spin systems is single - molecule magnets ( smms ) .",
    "smms display an extremely rich behavior and have been attracting much attention in recent years . a variety of smms has already been discovered and investigated , see refs .   for a review , and new systems are being found @xcite .",
    "another example of large - spin systems is provided by large nuclear spins , the interest in which has renewed in view of their possible use in quantum computing @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of large - spin systems , @xmath3 , in the classical limit .",
    "we assume that the system is in a strong static magnetic field along the easy magnetization axis and in an almost resonant transverse field . for a small relaxation rate ,",
    "even a weak transverse resonant field can lead to hysteresis of the response . as we show",
    ", the hysteresis is quite unusual .",
    "it is convenient to describe the dynamics of a resonantly modulated spin in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "the corresponding analysis in the absence of relaxation has revealed a special quantum feature , an antiresonance of the response which accompanies anticrossing of quasienergy levels @xcite .",
    "quantum spin dynamics in the rotating frame bears also on the dynamics of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite",
    ".    one may expect that the features of the coherent quantum dynamics should have counterparts in the classical spin dynamics in the presence of dissipation . as we show , this is indeed the case .",
    "the system displays an unusual behavior in a certain range of modulation parameters .",
    "this behavior is due to a special symmetry .",
    "it leads to specific features of hysteresis and to discontinuous ( in the neglect of fluctuations ) switching between different response branches even in the absence of hysteresis .",
    "classical dynamics of a large - spin system in a resonant field would be expected to have similarities with the dynamics of a modulated magnetic nanoparticle near ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "it was understood back in the 1950 s @xcite that the response near ferromagnetic resonance becomes strongly nonlinear already for comparatively weak radiation strength due to the magnetization dependence of the effective magnetic field .",
    "resonant response may become multivalued as a function of the modulating field amplitude @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of nonlinear magnetization dynamics in uniaxial nanoparticles modulated by a strong circularly polarized periodic field was done recently @xcite .",
    "these studies as well as many other studies of magnetization dynamics in ferromagnets were based on the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation .",
    "in contrast to magnetic nanoparticles , for large - spin systems quantum effects are substantial .",
    "a distinction which remains important in the classical limit concerns relaxation mechanisms .",
    "spin relaxation occurs via transitions between discrete energy levels with emission , absorption , or inelastic scattering of excitations of a thermal reservoir to which the spin is coupled .",
    "relevant relaxation mechanisms depend on the specific system but as we show , even in the classical limit relaxation is not described , generally , by the landau - lifshitz damping . as a result",
    "the classical spin dynamics strongly differs from the dynamics of a magnetic nanoparticle .",
    "the microscopic analysis of relaxation is simplified in the presence of a strong static magnetic field . here , all spin energy levels are almost equidistant .",
    "therefore excitations of the thermal bath emitted , for example , in transitions within different pairs of neighboring levels have almost the same energies . as a consequence , relaxation is described by a small number of constants independent of the form of the weighted with the interaction density of states of the bath , and the analysis applies for an arbitrary ratio between the level nonequidistance and their relaxational broadening @xcite .",
    "we consider three relaxation mechanisms .",
    "two of them correspond to transitions between neighboring and next neighboring spin levels , with the coupling to bosonic excitations quadratic in the spin operators .",
    "such coupling is important , in particular , for smms where energy relaxation is due to phonon scattering .",
    "the theory of relaxation of smms was developed earlier @xcite and has been tested experimentally , see refs .   and papers cited therein .",
    "we also consider coupling to a bosonic bath linear in spin operators .",
    "it leads to relaxation that in the classical limit has the form of the landau - lifshitz damping provided the modulation field is weak compared to the static field , as assumed in the rwa .",
    "the typical duration of scattering events that lead to spin relaxation is often @xmath4 . in the rwa",
    "they appear instantaneous .",
    "the operator that describes relaxation has a simple functional form , with no retardation in the  slow \" time .",
    "this is advantageous for studying the classical limit and allows us to obtain analytical results .    in the classical limit",
    ", a spin is characterized by two dynamical variables , for example , azimuthal and polar angles . in the rwa , they satisfy autonomous equations of motion , the coefficients in these equations do not depend on time .",
    "a two - variable nonlinear dissipative system can have both stationary and periodic states @xcite . as we show , such states indeed emerge for a resonantly modulated spin . they were predicted also for a magnetic nanoparticle with landau - lifshitz damping in the case of a generally nonresonant modulation @xcite .    for a spin",
    ", the occurrence of periodic states in the rotating frame critically depends on the interrelation between the relaxation parameters .",
    "in particular , these states do not emerge for a resonantly modulated spin with microscopic relaxation that reduces to the landau - lifshitz damping in the rwa .",
    "moreover , quantum fluctuations lead to phase diffusion which results in decay of periodic states in the rotating frame , making the corresponding vibrations transient .",

    "we found that the spin dynamics has special symmetry at exact resonance where the modulation frequency is equal to the larmor frequency , @xmath276 .",
    "this symmetry leads to a hamiltonian - like behavior even in the presence of dissipation . in the rotating frame ,",
    "phase trajectories of the spin form closed loops in a part of or on the whole phase plane",
    ". therefore when @xmath6 goes through @xmath1 several states change stability at a time .",
    "the simultaneous stability change leads to unusual observable features . where the system has only one stable state for a given parameter value , as @xmath6 goes through @xmath1 there occurs switching between different states that leads to an abrupt change of the magnetization .",
    "the behavior is even more complicated where several stable states coexist for @xmath6 close but not equal to @xmath1 . here , where @xmath277 changes sign , the state into which the system will switch is essentially determined by fluctuations or by history ( if @xmath6 is changed comparatively fast ) .",
    "we found the conditions where the spin has more than one stable stationary state in the rotating frame .",
    "such stable states correspond to oscillations of the transverse magnetization at the driving frequency in the laboratory frame .",
    "multistability leads to magnetization hysteresis with varying parameters of the modulating field .",
    "if the fastest relaxation process is transitions between neighboring states due to coupling quadratic in spin operators , the resonantly modulated spin can have periodic nonsinusoidal states in the rotating frame with frequency @xmath278 , where @xmath9 is the anisotropy energy . in the laboratory frame , they correspond to oscillations of the transverse magnetization at combinations of this frequency ( and its overtones ) and the larmor frequency .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the spin lead to phase diffusion of the classical periodic states in the rotating frame . as a result , classical oscillations decay .",
    "the intensity of quantum fluctuations and the related decay rate depend on the value of @xmath279 .",
    "we have found @xcite that the oscillations decay comparatively fast even for @xmath15 .",
    "therefore they are transient . still the classically stable vibrations lead to pronounced features of the full quantum spin dynamics .",
    "the present analysis can be immediately extended to a more general form of the spin anisotropy energy , in particular to the case where along with @xmath280 this energy has a term @xmath281 , which is important for some types of single - molecule magnets @xcite . in the rwa , the corresponding term renormalizes @xmath9 and @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis applies also to decay due to two - phonon or two - magnon coupling , which often plays an important role in spin dynamics and leads to energy relaxation via inelastic scattering of bath excitations by the spin .",
    "another important generalization is that the results are not limited to linearly polarized radiation .",
    "it is easy to show that they apply for an arbitrary polarization as long as the radiation is close to resonance .    in conclusion ,",
    "starting from a microscopic model , we have shown that the classical dynamics of a resonantly modulated large spin in a strong magnetic field displays several characteristic features .",
    "they include abrupt switching between magnetization branches with varying parameters of the modulating field even where there is no hysteresis , as well as the occurrence of hysteresis and an unusual pattern of hysteretic inter - branch switching .",
    "these features are related to the hamiltonian - like behavior of the dissipative spin for modulation frequency equal to the larmor frequency in the neglect of spin anisotropy . along with",
    "forced vibrations at the modulation frequency , the transverse spin components can display transient vibrations at a combination of the modulation frequency and a slower frequency @xmath278 and its overtones .",
    "they emerge if the fastest relaxation mechanism corresponds to transitions between neighboring zeeman levels with the energy of coupling to a thermal bath quadratic in the spin operators .",
    "we are grateful to s.  w.  shaw for the discussion of the bifurcation pattern and to j.  vidal for pointing to the analogy with the lipkin - meshkov - glick model .",
    "this research was supported in part by the nsf through grant phy-0555346 and by the institute for quantum sciences at msu .",
    "in this appendix we outline the calculation of the relaxation of quasienergy @xmath28 near a hopf bifurcation point . for concreteness",
    "we assume that @xmath282 and the only nonzero damping parameter is @xmath148 . for small damping a stationary state that experiences a bifurcation has phase @xmath166 close to either 0 or @xmath168 , whereas @xmath283 .",
    "the dynamics is characterized by two parameters , @xmath284 and @xmath285 $ ] .",
    "the bifurcational value of the field for @xmath256 is @xmath286 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : hopf_explicit ] ) ] .    at the bifurcating stationary state",
    "the quasienergy is @xmath287 ; it is easy to see that this is a local minimum of @xmath288 for @xmath289 or a maximum for @xmath290 . respectively , on phase plane @xmath183 the constant-@xmath28 trajectories close to the bifurcating stationary state rotate about this state clockwise for @xmath291 and counterclockwise for @xmath290 .",
    "the angular frequency of this rotation is @xmath292 , where @xmath232 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : determinant ] ) .",
    "we now consider dissipation - induced drift over quasienergy @xmath224 .",
    "it is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_change ] ) . noting that @xmath293 and using the stokes theorem we can rewrite this equation as @xmath294 where the integral is taken over the interior of the constant-@xmath28 orbit on the @xmath105 plane and @xmath295 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : trace ] ) . at a hopf bifurcation point @xmath180 .",
    "therefore @xmath296 in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : ene_diss_stocks_integral ] ) must be expanded in @xmath297 .",
    "it is convenient to calculate integral ( [ eq : ene_diss_stocks_integral ] ) by changing to integration over action - angle variables @xmath298 , which are canonically conjugate to @xmath299 , with @xmath28 being the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the angle @xmath300 gives the phase of oscillations with given quasienergy @xmath28 .",
    "the action variable @xmath301 is related to @xmath28 by the standard expression @xmath302 ; we note that @xmath303 becomes negative away from the stationary state for @xmath290 .    in evaluating expression ( [ eq :",
    "ene_diss_stocks_integral ] ) it is further convenient to start with integration over @xmath300 .",
    "it goes from 0 to @xmath106 and corresponds to period averaging for a given @xmath304 ( integration over @xmath303 corresponds to integration over @xmath305 ) .",
    "if vibrations about @xmath306 were harmonic , the lowest - order term in @xmath307 that would not average to zero on integration over @xmath300 would be @xmath308 ( the derivative of @xmath125 is calculated at the bifurcating stationary state ) .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the integral over @xmath300 of the linear in @xmath307 term in @xmath125 is also @xmath309 .",
    "it can be calculated from equation of motion @xmath310 by expanding the right - hand side to second order in @xmath311 and noting that @xmath312 , where the overline means averaging over @xmath300 .",
    "this gives , after some algebra , @xmath313 this expression combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ene_diss_stocks_integral ] ) shows how the energy relaxation rate depends on the field @xmath165 .",
    "it is used in section  [ sec : quadratic_in_s ] to establish the full bifurcation diagram ."
