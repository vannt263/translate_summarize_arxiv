    "there are two key properties of the dispersion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) .",
    "first , the dispersion has two degenerate minima .",
    "typically this results in a ground state wavefunction which oscillates in space .",
    "second , the dispersion is anharmonic .",
    "some of the theorems in quantum mechanics ( such as the non - existence of nodes in the ground state ) are based on having a purely harmonic dispersion . in appropriately tailored potentials ,",
    "an anharmonic dispersion with a single minimum can even lead to ground - state nodes . to draw out the role of these features",
    ", we consider the following potentials : infinite square well , harmonic oscillator , double well .",
    "anharmonic dispersion are ubiquitous in lattice systems , but we are unaware of an analogous study .",
    "lattice systems have the additional feature that momentum space is periodic .",
    "we adimensionalize eq .  ( [ eq : main ] ) , scaling all energies by @xmath22 and lengths by @xmath23 .",
    "we restrict ourself to one dimension ( 1d ) , assuming that a tight trap has frozen out motion perpendicular to the @xmath24 direction .",
    "extending the discussion to the three - dimensional case is straightforward , but the interesting results already appear in 1d .    in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath25 ,",

    "( [ eq : adim ] ) , we discretize space , and write the operator @xmath29 as a matrix , using finite difference approximations of various orders .",
    "we then numerically calculate the square root by standard algorithms .",
    "we verify that our results are independent of the discretization grid and the order of our approximation .",
    "the simplest potential to investigate is the infinite square well .",
    "this is most easily defined by taking the limit @xmath30 of the finite square well @xmath31 it should be emphasized that even in the limit @xmath30 , the boundary condition at the edge of the well is not simply that the wavefunction vanishes , otherwise the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adim ] ) is not self - adjoint . if one discretizes space as described in sec .",
    "[ tech ] , and maintains a finite but large @xmath32 , one automatically produces a self - adjoint hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenstates can be classified by the number of nodes they possess . in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarewelles ] , we show the energies of the lowest two eigenstates as a function of the width of the potential well .",
    "as one increases the well width , the lowest symmetric and antisymmetric state take turns being ground state .",
    "these crossings can be understood by noting that there is a preferred wave - vector in the problem . in free space",
    "the lowest energy state has wave - vector @xmath33 .",
    "as one increases the size of the well , different numbers of half - waves of this wavevector fit into the well .",

    "[ fig : squarewellks ] we show the two non - zero wavevectors of the ground - state inside the well .",
    "there are exactly two wavevectors as the equation @xmath34 can be manipulated to make a quadratic equation .",
    "this quadratic will have two real roots when @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in fig .",

    "there are two reasons to study the harmonic potential .",
    "first , the harmonic oscillator is one of the paradigmatic examples of quantum mechanics .",
    "second , we will be able to get further insight into the structure of the ground state by considering a canonical transformation which switches position and momentum . our main results , illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : shoes ] and [ fig : shonodes ] , are qualitatively similar to those of the infinite square well .",
    "the main differences are : ( 1 ) the harmonic potential favors states which have a higher amplitude at the center , resulting in a symmetric ground state .",
    "( 2 ) one can not readily define the  number of nodes \" , as the wavefunction is spread over an infinite domain , and generically oscillates an infinite number of times .",
    "one can , however , consider analogous measures , such as how many nodes lie within a fixed number of oscillator lengths .",
    "we consider a potential of the form @xmath42 and numerically calculate the eigenstates as before .",
    "figure  [ fig : shoes ] shows the energy of the two lowest energy states as a function of @xmath43 . unlike the square well , there are no level crossings , instead the two states simply asymptotically approach one - another .",
    "figure  [ fig : shonodes ] shows a density density plot of the ground state wavefunction as a function of @xmath44 for a range of @xmath43 . as one sees , the locations of the nodes are set by the characteristic wave - vector @xmath45 , while a broader envelope is determined by the width of the potential @xmath43 .",
    "the simplest way to understand these results is to note that a canonical transformation @xmath46 , @xmath47 converts this to a standard quantum mechanics problem with a quadratic dispersion and a double well potential .",
    "thus the the fourier transform of the wavefunction , @xmath48 , is the real - space wavefunction of a conventional double well .",

    "our final potential is the double well , @xmath56}^{2}.\\ ] ] this is particularly interesting , as now we may have both a double well in momentum space and a double well in real space .",
    "either of these double - wells can take the ground state from symmetric to antisymmetric .",
    "figure  [ fig : doubledouble ] shows a cut through parameter space that illustrates this principle .",
    "considering only changes to the real - space potential , there are several different scenarios which lead to an antisymmetric ground state .",
    "first , as in sec .  [ squarewell ] , changing the width of the real - space well changes the number of half - wavelengths of wavevector @xmath45 that fit .",
    "when an even number of half - wavelengths is optimal , the ground state is antisymmetric .",
    "equivalently , changing @xmath45 while fixing the real - space potential , can drive a transition .",
    "second , the bump in the double - well potential , favors wavefunctions which have a node in the center . in regular quantum mechanics",
    ", this effect never drives the energy of the antisymmetric state below that of the symmetric state . here , with the non - quadratic dispersion , one can however find a level crossing . by transforming @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "one can repeat these arguments in fourier space .    ) . increasing the ordinate , @xmath59 ,",
    "increases the size of the barrier in the real space potential , while increasing the abscissa , @xmath60 , decreases the size of the barrier in the double - well momentum space dispersion .",
    "light areas have a symmetric ground state and dark areas antisymmetric . here",
    "we take @xmath61 . ]",
    "our discussion so far centered on the dispersion curve eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) and the resulting hamiltonian eq .  ( [ eq : main ] )",
    ". this form is achieved by applying a unitary transformation @xmath62 to the hamiltonian found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : threed ] ) , after neglecting the decoupled off - resonance state . however , this transformation is a function of momentum , @xmath63 and so it does not commute with the physical potential . under this transformation , the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adim ] ) representing the potential is @xmath64 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the physical trap potential . in our discussion",

    "( [ correct ] ) .",
    "here we consider the limits of validity of this approximation .    as is clear from dimensional analysis , the corrections to our approximation will involve terms such as @xmath66 .",
    "if the characteristic scale of the changes in @xmath67 are large compared to @xmath68 , then these corrections can be neglected . in our dimensionless units",
    ", this requires the potential @xmath69 to only change on a length - scale large compared to unity . in all sections , we investigated potentials of this form , and hence we expect our results to be robust .",
    "numerical investigation of the full spinor hamiltonian , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : validity ] , confirms that eq .",

    "in this paper we explored the implications of the dispersion relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) on the ground state wavefunction for several archetypical potentials .",
    "we found that the symmetry of the wavefunction could be changed by modifying the trapping potential .",
    "this feature would also be seen for more general dispersion relations where @xmath72 is non - quadratic and/or has multiple degenerate minima .",
    "lin et al.s recent realization @xcite of the dispersion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) offers an opportunity to experimentally test our predictions .",
    "the symmetry / antisymmetry of the ground state could be explored by either real - space probes ( absorption imaging ) or momentum - space probes ( time - of - flight ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath68 is large compared to one s imaging resolution , one can simply count nodes or antinodes in the wavefunction . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath73 nm , but this can be made longer by changing the angle between the raman beams .",
    "an interesting use of time - of - flight would involve interfering outgoing waves with momentum @xmath74 and @xmath75 , giving a definitive measure of the symmetry / antisymmetry of the state .",
    "one should be able to map out the phase diagram seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : doubledouble ] : changing @xmath76 and @xmath77 to achieve different sized bumps in the physical potential and the dispersion relation .",
    "in particular , a clear transition should be seen going from a symmetric state localized in time and momentum for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , to an antisymmetric double - well state for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this corresponds to a barrier whose depth is @xmath82 nk and a raman coupling of order @xmath83 khz .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarewelles ] , for a symmetric potential , the transitions between different symmetry ground states are true crossings , and one can not adiabatically change from one to another . however ,",
    "if one introduces some asymmetry , these will become avoided crossings .",
