    "in spite of many efforts the final description of the strong coupling sector of the yang - mills theory still remains a challenge for theoretical physicists .",
    "an interesting approach to this problem is based on some non - perturbative methods which involve soliton solutions .",
    "the importance of solitons in particle physics has increased significantly since it became clear that they could play a role as suitable normal modes in the description of strong coupling regime for some physical theories @xcite .",
    "the presence of solitons is an evidence of a high degree of symmetries of the model that can be associated with conserved quantities .",
    "the relation between symmetries and conserved quantities is often described in terms of the noether theorem . however , this is not the case for solitons since the symmetries associated with them are neither symmetries of the lagrangian nor of the related equations of motion .",
    "in fact , at the first sight there are no obvious symmetries that can be associated with such a large number of conserved quantities . for this reason",
    "they are called _",
    "hidden symmetries_. the study of some two dimensional integrable field theories has shed new light on this issue showing that hidden symmetries are , in fact , symmetries of the zero curvature condition known also as the lax - zakharov - shabat equation @xcite . the question that rises is if there exists a counterpart of such structures in higher dimensional field theories and , in particular , in gauge theories in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "an answer to such question was given in @xcite where a generalization of some ideas of integrability to higher dimensions was proposed using the construction of flat connections on a loop space .",
    "such an approach has already led to successes in some field theoretic models and so this approach has been reformulated further in @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite this approach has been used to construct integral formulations of the classical equations of motion of yang - mills theories in @xmath5 dimensions , chern - simons theories i n @xmath6 dimensions , and integrable field theories in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "the obtained results show some interesting connections between gauge and integrable field theories . for these reasons",
    "this approach seems to be a useful tool for dealing with effective models for strongly coupled yang - mills theories such as the skyrme - faddeev model @xcite .",
    "recently , two of us @xcite , have proposed a version of the @xmath5 dimensional skyrme - faddeev model which differs from the standard skyrme - faddeev model in two aspects .",
    "the first difference is the target space of the model . in the case of the model discussed in @xcite",
    "the target space is the complex projective space @xmath0 which is isomorphic to the symmetric space @xmath8 . due to the arguments presented in @xcite , for @xmath9",
    "this could be an alternative description of the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom which , in the paper of kondo @xcite , is refered to as the _",
    "minimal case_. the other case , for which the target space is the coset space @xmath10 which is frequently used in the literature , corresponds to the _",
    "maximal case_. the version of the skyrme -faddeev model and its exact vortex solution in the simplest case of the @xmath11 target space has been already studied before in @xcite .",
    "the second difference is related to the presence of some additional quartic terms in the lagrangian .",
    "if fact , as shown by h. gies in @xcite , such quartic terms appear unavoidably in the wilsonian effective action of the @xmath12 yang - mills theory calculated up to one loop level .",
    "this observation suggests a possibility of the appearance of similar quartic terms in the effective action of the physically more relevant case of the @xmath13 yang - mills theory . when compared with the @xmath14 case , the skyrme - faddeev model on the @xmath0 target space ( @xmath15 ) allows us to add a further quartic term . for the model with @xmath15",
    "this term provides a new contribution to the total energy density in the integrable sector of the model .",
    "this extra contribution drops out when @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to gain a better understanding of the main consequences of such quartic terms in the model , and this is one of the motivations of our study which is described in the present paper .    in this paper",
    "we address these issues and study some exact vortex solutions of the extended skyrme - faddeev model for the target space @xmath0 .",
    "as shown in @xcite such theory possesses an integrable sector with an infinite number of local conserved currents .",
    "this integrable sector is defined by some specific conditions on the gradients of the fields and some relations among the coupling constants .",
    "we consider a large class of solutions of the sector corresponding to field configurations which are arbitrary functions of the variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , being the cartesian coordinates of the four dimensional minkowski space - time .",
    "apparently , there are no finite energy solutions inside this class , but there are physically interesting configurations corresponding to the vortices which are parallel to the @xmath20-axis with waves traveling along them with the speed of light . in this paper",
    "we generalize the results of @xcite by constructing solutions corresponding to many such vortices distributed symmetrically on the @xmath21-plane , and in some cases rotating relative to each other .",
    "we study some of their properties ; such as their topological charges and the dependence of the energy per unit of length on their separation and on the frequency of their rotation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our vortices are also solutions of the pure @xmath0 in @xmath5 dimensions and so are related to the configurations considered in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss the model , its integrable sector and recall some of its exact solutions and also their relation to the solutions of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the third section contains new results obtained from the study of the quartic terms . in the fourth section we present some examples of the exact solutions that illustrate the results of the previous section .",
    "we also present a numerical example for which the position of the minimum of the energy density depends significantly on the values of the parameters of this solution .",
    "the paper finished with some conclusions .",
    "the model considered in @xcite , is an extension of the @xmath5-dimensional skyrme - faddeev model on the target space @xmath0 , obtained by the inclusion of two terms which are quartic in derivatives of the fields .",
    "the original formulation of the model explored the fact that @xmath0 is a symmetric space , namely @xmath8 , and so the fields where parametrized by the ` so - called principal ' variable @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 being the order two automorphism under which the subgroup @xmath25 is invariant .",
    "therefore , one has @xmath26 , if @xmath27 . for the purpose of this paper",
    "it is enough to express the lagrangian in terms of the quantity @xmath28 defined as @xmath29 . in this formulation",
    "the lagrangian of the model takes the form = -(p_^2)+([p_,p_])^2+^2+^2,[lagrangiansf ] where @xmath28 can be parametrized by the set of complex scalar fields @xmath30 in the following way : p_= (    cc 0_nn & _ u + _ u^ & 0    ) u= (    c u_1 +   + u_n    ) . the symbol @xmath31 denotes the hermitian matrix @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "thus in this parametrization of the @xmath34-dimensional complex projective space @xmath0 we choose to use @xmath34 complex scalar fields @xmath35 .",
    "the first term in ( [ lagrangiansf ] ) , namely , @xmath36 corresponds to the @xmath0 lagrangian which , in the standard formulation , takes the form _ cpn = m^2(d_z)^d^z , ^=1,[lagrangiancpn ] where the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath37 . in ( [ lagrangiancpn ] )",
    "we have also included a dimensional constant @xmath38 since we are interested in comparing the results of the model based on this term alone to those based on the full model ( [ lagrangiansf ] ) .",
    "this correspondence is established via the parametrization @xmath39 for which @xmath40 , by definition , satisfy the condition @xmath41 .",
    "one can check that the part of the lagrangian @xmath42 proportional to @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath43 _ i.e. _ @xmath44 .",
    "the last three terms in ( [ lagrangiancpn ] ) are quartic in powers of derivatives . amongst them",
    "the term proportional to @xmath45 is the standard skyrme - faddeev quartic term whereas those proportional to @xmath46 and @xmath47 constitute an extension of the model .",
    "the extension contains all possible quartic terms that can be considered for this model .",
    "note that in the case of the @xmath11 target space the three quartic terms produce only two types of terms , namely @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , in this case , out of the three coupling constants @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , only two are independent .",
    "this statement is not longer true for @xmath50 , where the interplay between the lorentz indices @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the internal indices @xmath53 and @xmath54 produces extra independent terms . hence , in the case @xmath50 both @xmath46 and @xmath47 can play a significant role .",
    "one of the most important results presented in @xcite was the demonstration that the extended skyrme - faddeev model ( [ lagrangiansf ] ) possesses an integrable sub - sector ( sub - model ) with an infinite number of conserved currents .",
    "the integrability condition has the form ^u_i_u_j=0 , i , j=1,2,  ,n.[constraint ] in what follows we shall refer to ( [ constraint ] ) as _ the constraints_. as shown in @xcite the equations of motion of ( [ lagrangiansf ] ) together with the constraints ( [ constraint ] ) imply that for any arbitrary functional @xmath55 of the fields @xmath35 and @xmath56 , but not of their derivatives , there exists a current @xmath57 which is conserved , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath58 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in addition , it was also shown in @xcite that if one imposes a particular relation among the coupling constants ; namely : @xmath59 , the integrable sub - model possesses a wide classes of exact solutions .",
    "these solutions are given by arbitrary meromorphic functions of the complex variable @xmath16 and of the real variable @xmath60 , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , being the cartesian coordinates of the minkowski space - time .",
    "indeed , the configurations u_i",
    "= u_i(z , y_+),u_i^*=u_i^*(|z , y_+),e^2+e^2=2,[constraint2 ] satisfy the euler -lagrange equations corresponding to ( [ lagrangiansf ] ) as well as the constraints ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "in fact , there is more to it . the configurations ( [ constraint2 ] ) satisfy the following equations ^_u_i=0 , ^u_i_u_j=0,^[_u_i_u_j]=0[expr ] .    note that solutions of ( [ constraint2 ] ) are also solutions of the @xmath0 model in @xmath5 dimensions , _",
    "i.e. _ the model defined by the lagrangian ( [ lagrangiancpn ] ) or the first term in ( [ lagrangiansf ] ) .",
    "that fact has been explored in @xcite to construct vortex solutions for the @xmath0 model . therefore , a key point to be stressed is the observation that the @xmath0 model and the integrable sector of the extended skyrme - faddeev model share a wide class of solutions given by the solutions of ( [ expr ] ) .",
    "the vortex - type solutions presented in @xcite are more general that those of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the vortices can be located at any distance from each other - and so we can study their dependence on this distance ( in the previous case this distance was zero as they were located on ` top of each other ' ) .",
    "in fact we find that the energy per unit length of the vortex depends in a nontrivial way on the distance between any two or more individual vortices .",
    "we would like to add , however , that not all solutions of the @xmath0 model are simultaneously solutions of the extended skyrme - faddeev model .",
    "the class of the so - called _ mixed solutions _ , @xmath61 of the @xmath0 model , see also @xcite , that we have discussed in @xcite , does not satisfy the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) and so they are not solutions of the integrable sub - model . in this paper",
    "we concentrate our attention on the contribution to the total energy density generated by the quartic terms .",
    "we are especially interested in the dependence of the energy per unit length on the distance between vortices .",
    "it is convenient to split the hamiltonian into three parts @xmath62 where the subscript @xmath63 implies that the hamiltonian is already restricted to the integrable sector by assuming ( [ constraint2 ] ) .",
    "the first two contributions are given by ^(1 ) , ^(2 ) , where @xmath64 .",
    "the quartic contribution can be cast in the form ^(3)_i , j , k , l=1^n^2_ij^2_klb_ik^*b_jl , [ h3def ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian @xmath67 is positive definite for @xmath68 since each of its contributions @xmath69 , @xmath70 is positive definite .",
    "the proof of the positive definiteness is given in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagrangiansf ] ) is invariant under the phase transformations @xmath71 , @xmath72",
    ". the associated noether currents ( for the restricted sub - model ) are given by @xmath73 where we have split the expression of @xmath74 into two parts _ ^(i)_j=1^nand _ ^(i)&-&_j , k , l=1^n .",
    "next we observe that both contributions @xmath75 and @xmath76 are conserved independently as a consequence of the fact that in the integrable sector the fields satisfy the relations ( [ expr ] ) . indeed , using ( [ expr ] ) one can check that @xmath77 . since the noether theorem implies @xmath78 it follows that @xmath79 .",
    "another way of obtaining this result is to observe that ( [ expr ] ) also defines an integrable submodel of the pure @xmath0 model , and that @xmath75 is the noether current of such a model , associated with the symmetry @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , @xmath75 is conserved , and so is @xmath76 by the same argument .    following @xmath80 we shall express the restricted hamiltonian density @xmath67 in terms of the time component of above mentioned noether currents .",
    "we find that _ 0^(i)= and _ 0^(i)&=&_j , k , l=1^n.[current0 ]    thus the hamiltonian density can be rewritten as @xmath81 where the first term is purely topological and the last two , related to the noether currents , involve derivatives _ w.r.t .",
    "_ @xmath82 .",
    "thus it follows that the energy per unit length can be cast in the form @xmath83 where the expression in the bracket describes the noether charges @xmath84 .",
    "the topological charge is given by the integral q_top_r^2dx^1dx^2^(1 ) [ qtopdef ] and in a similar manner we have introduced @xmath85 and @xmath86 _ i.e. _ ^(i)_r^2dx^1dx^2^(2),^(i)_r^2dx^1dx^2^(3 ) the reason why we split the charges @xmath84 into two parts will be made clear in the next section .",
    "in this section we restrict our study to the case @xmath87 .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "firstly , this case is more interesting from the physical point of view since the yang - mills theory is a gauge theory based on the symmetry group @xmath13 .",
    "secondly , it is the simplest case for which @xmath88 is not identically zero .    in contradistinction to the parts @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the contribution to the energy density @xmath88 contains terms that have both type of derivatives _ i.e. w.r.t . _ @xmath91 and @xmath82 .",
    "the term @xmath89 is a total derivative and therefore is purely topological whereas @xmath90 has nothing to do with topology since it does not even contain any derivatives _",
    "_ @xmath91 or @xmath92 . from the point of view of topology",
    "one can , however , expect that @xmath88 may have some interesting properties .",
    "indeed , encouraged by the results of our numerical studies we have managed to establish a relation between the topological charge @xmath93 and the contribution @xmath86 to the total noether charge .",
    "the topological charge arises in the contribution to the energy per unit length calculated from @xmath88 when only one of the functions @xmath94 or @xmath95 depends on @xmath91 . without any loss of generality we can choose , for instance , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "one can then check that in this case the expression @xmath88 , given in ( [ h3def ] ) , takes the form ^(3)=2_+u_2^*_+u_2 .    denoting @xmath98",
    ", we observe that @xmath99 $ ] , where we have denoted @xmath100 .",
    "when integrating over @xmath101 and @xmath102 we can use the fact that the integral @xmath103 is invariant under rescaling of @xmath104 by a constant , since it is a topological quantity .",
    "therefore , we obtain the result _ r^2dx^1dx^2^(3)=q_top . where @xmath93 is defined in ( [ qtopdef ] ) .",
    "thus we see that the energy per unit length for this special choice of scalar fields @xmath94 and @xmath95 is a product of the topological charge and of a function which depends only on @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that , for some special solutions , the topology can play an important role also for the energy of the interaction generated by the quartic term .",
    "the zero - components of the noether currents ( [ current0 ] ) in this case become _ 0^(1)=0,_0^(2)=. the @xmath101 and @xmath102 integration then gives _",
    "r^2dx^1dx^2^(2)_0^(2)=q_top , which is , again , a product of the topological charge and of some function of the variable @xmath82 .",
    "one can easily check that the only dependence on @xmath105 of @xmath106 that guarantees the proportionality of the two last integrals is @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are real constants . in order to see this",
    "one can express the complex scalar field @xmath95 in terms of two real fields @xmath110 and @xmath111 _ i.e. _ @xmath112 .",
    "then it follows from the proportionality condition that @xmath113 and so that @xmath114 this equation is satisfied by @xmath115 being a constant @xmath116 and @xmath117",
    ". then ^(2)=q_top.[relation ]    it is easy to observe that this is the only case when the ratio of the two charges is a constant . in consequence",
    ", the energy contribution can be expressed in terms of the corresponding noether charge .",
    "if one choses , for instance , @xmath106 as a real function @xmath118 then the contribution to the energy per unit length remains some function of @xmath82 , while still keeping its proportionality to @xmath93 , whereas both noether charges vanish .",
    "it is clear that the other possible choice , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath119 and @xmath120 , is equivalent to the one discussed above . the third possibility leading to the proportionality of the energy per unit length @xmath121 to the topological charge @xmath93 arises when both scalar fields @xmath94 and @xmath95 possess the same dependence on @xmath91 ( or @xmath92 ) _ i.e. _ @xmath122 . this can be easily seen if , instead of parametrization in terms of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , one considers @xmath123 , introduced in ( [ lagrangiancpn ] ) , parametrized as = .",
    "[ zfpar ] comparing this with ( [ udef ] ) we note that there are several equally good possibilities of the choice of @xmath35 _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath124 or @xmath125 , @xmath126 _ e.t.c .",
    "_ this demonstrates that two possibilities ( u_1,u_2,1)(1,u_2,u_1)=(1 , , ) are totally equivalent .",
    "moreover , this discussion shows that in this new reparametrisation we are taken back to the previous case @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "hence these two results are equivalent .",
    "in this section we give some examples of solutions that are based on the solution of the @xmath129 model discussed in @xcite and some generalizations of the multi vortex solutions discussed in @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the topological case ( the quartic term becomes a topological one ) but in the final subsection we discuss also a numerical solution which is not of this type .",
    "for such a solution the minimum of the energy per unit length depends on the coupling constants .      for some arbitrary choices of the set of functions",
    "@xmath130 introduced in ( [ zfpar ] ) , or equivalently @xmath131 , the energy density per unit length is a very complicated function .",
    "therefore it is quite hard to discover what is the relation between the values of the parameters of the solution and the distances between maxima of the energy density . in order to overcome this problem",
    "it is convenient to study some cases with a symmetric distribution of maxima of the energy density .",
    "the positions of maxima depend on zeros of the functions @xmath130 . when only one of these functions has zeroes then maxima are located at these zeroes . for this reason we first consider the following case @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "the power @xmath134 is the maximal degree of polynomials in @xmath91 which so gives @xmath135 . when @xmath136 the energy per unit length @xmath121 has to be proportional to the topological charge . moreover , in this case @xmath137",
    "according to the previous section the noether charge and the topological charge are proportional for @xmath136 .",

    "this example shows that for some energy density contributions , like a quartic term which we discussed here , the integral over the @xmath193 plane can be time independent in spite of the fact that the energy density is not .",
    "it is important to stress that there is no rotation here which explains the time independence of the energy per unit length .",
    "another interesting solution can be obtained by a straightforward generalization of the vortex solution presented in @xcite .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the one parameter solution of the form u_j(z , y_+)=(z-)^n_j(z+)^m_je^ik_jy_+,j=1,2[multivortex ] where @xmath194 is some real number .",
    "for the values of @xmath194 being sufficiently large the energy density is localized around the points @xmath195 taking the form of either peaks or craters . as a vortex is not a point - like object in order to study the dependence of the energy per unit length on the separation between vortices one has to define what the expression `` the distance between vortices '' means . in order to do",
    "so one needs to chose some characteristic parameters of the solution . in the case of the solution ( [ multivortex ] )",
    "we only have the points @xmath195 in the complex plane .",
    "for @xmath196 the value @xmath197 is a distance between centers of two local peaks ( or craters ) in the plot of the energy density .",
    "however , for smalles @xmath194 s the picture of the energy density becomes more complicated and the reference to the points @xmath195 as to the centers of the vortices is no longer valid .",
    "thus , we can think of @xmath197 as the distance between vortices only for separated vortices .",
    "according to discussion in the previous section , for the solutions of the form @xmath198 the quartic term contribution to the energy density has a topological nature .",
    "taking @xmath199 and @xmath200 one can replace the solution by the equivalent one @xmath201 which gives @xmath202 where for @xmath203 , @xmath204 for @xmath205 and @xmath206 for @xmath207 . when @xmath208 then @xmath209 and vice versa .",
    "the integral does not depend on @xmath194 which is a counterpart of the parameter @xmath151 from example 1 .",
    "fig.[ex2_a ] shows the integral @xmath210 which is the only contribution to the total energy per unit length which depends on the distance between vortices . for solutions of the form ( [ multivortex ] ) not all combinations @xmath211 and @xmath212 lead to the finite energy per unit length .",
    "in fact a grid of points corresponding to acceptable combinations of exponents forms a quite complex structure but we shall not discuss this problem here because it is beyond the scope of present paper .",
    "the common property of all solution having the quartic term topological is that the minimum of the total energy density is determined only by properties of the integral @xmath210 . because of this the position of the minimum does not depend on the coupling constants",
    "when the quartic term can not be reduced to the topological case the minimum ( if it exists ) depends on the mutual relation between quadratic and quartic terms .",
    "the position of such a minimum is a function of the ratio @xmath213 .",
    "this possibility is new since the quartic term for the model with a target space being @xmath11 is identically zero if one imposes the integrability conditions ( [ constraint ] ) . as an example we consider a solution of the modified skyrme- fadeev model in a @xmath129 target space .",
    "such a solution corresponds to ( [ multivortex ] ) for the choice @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "fig.[ex2_b ] shows two contributions to the energy density .",
    "the quadratic contribution leeds to energy per unit length that increases with a distance between two multi - vortices .",
    "this contribution has a minimum at @xmath219 .",
    "the contribution to the energy per unit length given by the quartic term has maximum for @xmath219 and it decreases as @xmath194 tends to infinity what means that the quartic term leads to a repulsive interaction between two multi - vortices .",
    "fig.[ex2_c ] shows the sum of quadratic @xmath90 and @xmath88 contributions to the total energy per unit length @xmath220 in both cases the combination of the terms leads to a minimum situated at some @xmath221 .",
    "the left picture corresponds to the choice @xmath222 whereas the right picture shows the combination with @xmath223 .",
    "in this paper we have shown that holomorphic solutions of the @xmath0 model are also solutions of the extended @xmath0 skyrme - faddeev model . in fact , these are very special solutions since they belong to an integrable sub - model of the @xmath0 skyrme - faddeev theory , defined by the constraints ( [ constraint ] ) , and the condition on the coupling constants given by @xmath224 .",
    "the constraints ( [ constraint ] ) imply that such sub - model possesses an infinite number of conserved currents .",
    "as the total energy of these solutions is infinite these solutions should be interpreted as describing time dependent vortices , and they generalize the results obtained in @xcite .    in this paper we have studied the properties , and in particular the dynamics of these multi - vortex solutions of the @xmath0 skyrme - faddeev model .",
    "the structure of the solutions is very complex and diverse , and we have in fact considered only some types of solutions which are interesting from the physical point of view .",
    "we have shown for instance that in some cases one of the terms in the energy density is related to the noether charge of the model , and in some other cases the energy density can be factorized in the product of two terms where one of them is the topological charge .",
    "it has been put forward in @xcite that the @xmath0 skyrme - faddeev model might describe some aspects of the low energy ( strong coupling ) regime of the pure @xmath12 yang - mills theory .",
    "if that is indeed the case , the solutions constructed in this paper certainly must play a role , describing some type of low energy excitations of the yang - mills theory .",
    "for those reasons more research work is needed to get a better understanding of these interesting phenomena .    * acknowlegment : * l.a .",
