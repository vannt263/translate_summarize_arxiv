    "the creation of specific flows of an electrically conducting fluid is the key element and major challenge in experimental investigation of dynamo phenomenon .",
    "appropriate candidates for this role are the flows capable of the dynamo action , a number of them are theoretically studied in literature @xcite . in most of these studies",
    "kinematic dynamos are considered , i.e. , the magnetic induction equation is treated as an eigenvalue problem for an unknown magnetic field and a prescribed laminar flow .",
    "the model flow is usually chosen in a simple analytical form , which is not necessarily determined from the fluid dynamics .",
    "in fact , the majority of analyzed flows leading to kinematic dynamos do not satisfy the navier - stokes equation ( e.g. , flows from refs .",
    "@xcite ) , so their structure can not be reproduced exactly in the laboratory . nevertheless , it is possible to obtain experimentally a flow sufficiently close to the model one , which may result in the dynamo action .    in the past decade ,",
    "several groups constructed dynamo experiments intended to achieve such flows with liquid metals @xcite .",
    "although the obtained flows were highly turbulent in all the experiments , their mean parts were expected to sustain a dynamo field .",
    "however , only three experiments were successful in dynamo demonstration : experiments in riga , latvia @xcite , and karlsruhe , germany @xcite , where the flows were strongly constrained and the influence of turbulence was small , and a von krmn sodium experiment in cadarache , france , where ferromagnetic impellers played the critical role @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that hydrodynamic turbulence in unconstrained flows significantly inhibits dynamo onset .",
    "the presence of turbulence is an inevitable problem in all liquid metal dynamo experiments .",
    "this is due to the extremely low magnetic prandtl numbers of the liquid metals , i.e. , the ratio of kinetic viscosity @xmath6 to resistivity @xmath7 or , equivalently , the ratio of magnetic reynolds number to fluid reynolds number @xmath8 ( e.g. , for liquid sodium @xmath9 ) . in order to reach the magnetic reynolds numbers sufficient for dynamo excitation ( @xmath10 ) , very high fluid reynolds numbers ( @xmath11 )",
    "are required . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding flows in experiments are always turbulent , making it difficult to achieve dynamos and to compare experimental data with predictions of laminar kinematic theory .",
    "note that the liquid metal laboratory dynamos with @xmath12 are in the regime of the solar convection zone and the interiors of planets , while hot accretion disks and galaxies have @xmath13 .",
    "the present study is motivated by construction of the madison plasma dynamo experiment ( mpdx , fig .",
    "[ mpdx ] ) , which is designed to investigate dynamos excited by controllable flows of plasma @xcite .",
    "the use of plasma as the electrically conducting fluid gives experimentalists flexibility in choosing a regime of dynamo operation . by adjusting experimental controls",
    ", one can change driving velocity , density , electron and ion temperatures , etc .",
    "this makes it possible to adjust @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 at will and study laminar dynamos with @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( table [ t1 ] ) .",
    "such flexibility is advantageous over the liquid metal dynamo experiments .",
    "the experimental vessel in mpdx is an aluminum sphere of 3 meter in diameter [ fig .",
    "[ mpdx](a ) ] .",
    "plasma is confined by an axisymmetric multicusp magnetic field created by 36 equally spaced rings of permanent magnets with alternating polarity .",
    "the plasma filling the vessel is mostly unmagnetized since the multicusp field is localized near the vessel wall .",
    "the novel feature of the experiment is the mechanism for creating controllable plasma flows [ fig .",
    "[ mpdx](b ) ] .",
    "an electric field applied across the multicusp magnetic field drives the edge of the plasma azimuthally , while viscosity couples momentum from the edge to the unmagnetized core .",
    "nearly arbitrary profiles of plasma azimuthal ( toroidal ) velocity @xmath18 can be imposed at the sphere s boundary by modulating the electric field as a function of polar angle @xmath19 using discrete electrodes .",
    "this concept of plasma stirring has been successfully tested in the plasma couette experiment ( pcx ) @xcite , and it allows a unique way to conduct laboratory studies of various astrophysical phenomena including the dynamo @xcite , the magnetorotational instability @xcite , and the parker instability @xcite .    .",

    "@xcite , the pure toroidal flow can not excite a dynamo in a spherical geometry , a finite poloidal component of flow is necessary too .",
    "therefore , dynamo onset should depend on the ratio of poloidal to toroidal flow amplitudes or , equivalently , the ratio of poloidal to toroidal kinetic energies .",
    "for the counter - rotating axisymmetric flow of dudley and james @xcite it was found that this ratio must be in a certain range in order to excite a dynamo . in a boundary driven flow ,",

    "[ epol ] shows the ratio of poloidal to toroidal kinetic energies @xmath21 as a function of @xmath1 for flows i , ii and iii .",

    "the presence of poloidal flow component with large enough amplitude compared to toroidal component is a necessary but not sufficient condition for dynamo onset .",
    "the similar driving velocity profiles of flows ii and iii produce similar ratios of poloidal to toroidal kinetic energies @xmath21 ( fig .",
    ". however , they are completely different from the dynamo point of view : flow iii leads to a dynamo action , while flow ii does not . such difference can be explained by the details of driving velocity profiles .",
