    "oscillations of the critical current @xmath33 in the p - doped regime are easier to observe in junctions a and e , which are significantly shorter than the other junctions .",
    "the dimension of the junctions are listed in table s1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "generally speaking , due to damping , environmental , and thermal effects the true critical current , @xmath33 , of a small josephson junction is inaccessible ; instead a smaller switching current @xmath85 is measured . in particular , in evaluating the dynamics of the junctions ( overdamped vs. underdamped ) it is important to consider the capacitance of the large ( @xmath86 ) bonding pads coupled via a global back gate , which could contribute up to @xmath87 to the junction capacitance . in our earlier work ( ref .  ) , we fabricated @xmath88 resistors in the leads in order to isolate the bonding pads , making the junctions certainly overdamped . in this work",
    ", the junctions are not purposefully isolated from the bonding pads .",
    "therefore , for the shortest junctions and at high critical currents , we estimate that the quality factor could potentially reach up to @xmath89 , the slightly underdamped regime .",
    "( the real @xmath90 of the junction may either be reduced due to the lead impedance , or increased due to the effectively suppressed internal dissipation of the junction at low temperatures . )",
    "we therefore chose to verify our approximation @xmath91 experimentally , by analyzing the statistical distribution of @xmath85 .",
    "the distribution is measured by repeatedly sweeping the bias current from zero past the switching , and recording @xmath85 at every sweep  @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath92 , the probability that the junction will switch from the superconducting to the normal state at bias current @xmath93 . obtaining the critical current @xmath33 via statistical methods , while more accurate , would take a prohibitively long time if performed for every junction , at every gate voltage @xmath35 and temperature @xmath41 . instead , we choose one of the shorter junctions ( e , 300 nm long ) , which would more likely demonstrate premature switching due to being underdamped .",
    "we then select several representative gate voltages and verify that the measured switching current @xmath85 is very close to the true critical current @xmath33 ( figure s2a ) .    instead of the probability distribution @xmath92",
    ", it is more informative to look at the junction escape rate @xmath94 , which may be obtained by summing over the switching histogram  @xcite @xmath95 \\right)\\ ] ] [ equ.1 ]    where @xmath96 is the current sweeping rate .",
    "the resulting calculation @xmath97 allows one to estimate the true critical current @xmath33 .",
    "as the bias current approaches the critical current @xmath98 , @xmath99 should follow the relationship : @xmath100 , with @xmath101 for switching mediated by thermal activation  @xcite .",
    "an example of this dependence is shown in figure s2b . by fitting this dependence",
    ", we obtain a good estimate of the critical current @xmath33 .",
    "we find that as @xmath33 increases , so does its difference from @xmath85 .",
    "however , even for the largest presented currents ( @xmath102a ) , the measured current is suppressed by not more than @xmath103 , so we are justified in using the measured @xmath85 in place of @xmath33 in the main text .",
    "figure s3 shows the critical current @xmath47 on a semilogarithmic scale for devices e , f and g. similar to devices in the main text , @xmath53 is clearly linear in @xmath41 over more than an order of magnitude , consistent with the expectation for long ballistic junctions .",
    "knowing the energy scale @xmath2 , we can examine the universality of the critical current @xmath33 in these ballistic devices . instead of the absolute temperature scale",
    ", we use the device - independent ratio @xmath104 , which accounts for the difference in junction lengths .",
    "next , we normalize the magnitude of the critical current , thus accounting for the device width , as well as the carrier concentration . the normalization point is chosen at @xmath105 , the lowest point for which data are available for all three junctions .",
    "the normalized current plotted versus @xmath104 falls on the same curve for the four junctions and different gate voltages ( figure s5 ) , which strongly indicates that the critical current is a universal function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath104 .",
    "we observed that at high density and @xmath41 approaching zero , each of the @xmath107 transverse modes contributes a supercurrent on the order of @xmath108 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 4 of the main paper , by showing that the ratio @xmath109 tends to a constant at high @xmath35 .",
    "however this ratio is suppressed close to charge neutrality , which we attributed to the lower contact transmission close to the dirac point , as illustrated in figure 3a inset .    in figure",
    "s7 we plot the ratio of @xmath110 to account for the fact that the normal resistance @xmath40 slightly differs from @xmath111 and the supercurrent carried by each mode should be reduced as @xmath112 .",
    "here we observe that the ratio saturates and becomes constant at gate voltages much closer to the dirac point , which suggests that the reduction in @xmath113 is indeed caused by the imperfect transmission at charge neutrality .",

    "<S> figure 4b shows the ratio @xmath73 as a function of the gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , the curves for the four junctions are very close to each other and converge to a constant level of @xmath74 at high gate voltage , where the graphene - more interfaces are highly transparent . </S>",

    "<S> the ratio @xmath73 is significantly reduced close to charge neutrality . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression most likely arises from the @xmath35 dependence of the transmission coefficient @xmath39 of the superconductor - graphene interface . </S>",
    "<S> we extract the contact transparency from the junction normal resistance as @xmath79 and find that while @xmath39 is close to 1 at high densities , it does get significantly suppressed close to the charge neutrality point . </S>",
    "<S> considering this suppression allows us to partially account for the reduced @xmath73 ratio ( see supplementary ) .    in conclusion , we studied the nature of the critical current in several ballistic superconductor - graphene - superconductor junctions . </S>",

    "<S> ( 1 ) , while in the intermediate and long junctions @xmath0 is @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of @xmath82 vs. @xmath41 dependence allows us to extract the energy scale @xmath2 , which depends on the junction length but not the gate voltage @xmath35 . while consistent for very long junctions @xmath83 , the values of @xmath2 for intermediate devices @xmath84 are smaller than those naively estimated from the junction lengths . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this suppression to the finite coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that at the lowest temperature , @xmath0 saturates at a level determined by the product of @xmath44 or @xmath2 ( depending on the regime ) , and the number of transversal modes across the junction width . </S>",
