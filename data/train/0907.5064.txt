    "helical patterns in the sunspots and associated features have been observed for a long time @xcite with a hemispheric preference of their chirality , which is independent of solar cycle . since the 90 s , the subject has been intensively revisited and the similar behaviour of hemispheric patterns for various solar features have been reported by many researchers ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , this hemispheric behaviour needs further investigation due to some inconsistencies reported for different phases of a solar cycle and also for data sets obtained from different magnetographs @xcite .    for a force - free field , the global twist per unit axial length",
    "is given by the force - free parameter @xmath0 ( see appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "some recent studies @xcite have shown that the global @xmath0 of an active region bears the same sign as its associated features / structures observed at chromospheric and coronal heights .",
    "the chromospheric and coronal sign of twist is inferred from the topological chirality sign of the observed features .",
    "this leads us to believe that some form of the photospheric global twist exists on the scale of sunspots .",
    "however , the structures in the sunspot fields revealed by modern vector magnetographs with high spatial and spectral resolution compels us to make a careful revaluation of global @xmath0 and its physical meaning .    since the photospheric field is not force - free @xcite , we need an alternative measure of the twist other than @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce the concept of signed shear angle ( ssa ) for sunspot magnetic fields in this paper and show how ssa is directly related to vertical current ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath0 , irrespective of the force - free nature of the sunspot fields .",
    "the presence of oppositely directed currents in a single unipolar sunspot was first shown by @xcite . for a detailed investigation of local @xmath0 distribution in three sunspots using 46 vector magnetograms",
    "see @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported an interesting pattern of fine structures in the @xmath0 distribution within one active region ( ar ) using hinode data with higher resolution .",
    "we present a comprehensive study of 43 sunspots with high resolution and establish the contribution of such fine structures to the global twist . for this purpose",
    "we will rely on @xmath2 and @xmath0 values .",
    "the helicity hemispheric rule or more precisely twist hemispheric rule is claimed to be established by many researchers @xcite and has recently been a matter of some debate @xcite .",
    "a model developed by @xcite predicts deviation from the twist hemispheric rule in the beginning of the solar cycle .",
    "however , some observers claim this deviation from the hemispheric rule may be present in different phases of different solar cycles @xcite .",
    "we have studied forty three ar s ( as shown in table 1 ) mostly observed during the declining phase of the solar cycle 23 . none but five follow the twist hemispheric rule .    in the following section ( section 2 ) ,",
    "we discuss the data sets used .",
    "section 3 describes the analysis and results obtained . finally in section 4",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "we have used the vector magnetograms obtained from solar optical telescope / spectro - polarimeter ( sot / sp : @xcite ) onboard hinode @xcite and the advanced stokes polarimeter ( asp ; @xcite ) as well as the diffraction limited spectro - polarimeter ( dlsp ; @xcite ) of the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) .",
    "standard and well - established calibration procedure was adopted for asp / dlsp data . the procedure for obtaining the vector fields from the asp / dlsp data",
    "are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the hinode ( sot / sp ) data have been calibrated by the standard `` sp_prep '' routine available in the solar - soft packages .",
    "the prepared polarization spectra have been inverted to obtain vector magnetic field components using an unno - rachkowsky @xcite inversion under the assumption of milne - eddington ( me ) atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the 180@xmath3 azimuthal ambiguity in the data sets are removed by using acute angle method @xcite .",
    "all the data sets used , have high spatial sampling .",
    "for example asp @xmath4 arcsec / pix , dlsp @xmath5 arcsec / pixel and hinode ( sot / sp ) @xmath4 arcsec / pixel .",
    "however , a few observations are seeing limited to about an arcsec .    to minimize noise , pixels having transverse @xmath6 and longitudinal magnetic field @xmath7 greater than a certain level",
    "are only analyzed .",
    "a quiet sun region is selected for each sunspot and 1@xmath8 deviation in the three vector field components @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are evaluated separately . the resultant deviations in @xmath9 and @xmath10 is then taken as the 1@xmath8 noise level for transverse field components .",
    "only those pixels where longitudinal and transverse fields are simultaneously greater than twice the above mentioned noise levels are analyzed .",
    "the data sets with their observation details are given in table 1 .",
    "the data sets observed from august 2001 to april 2005 are obtained with the asp and those observed from june 2005 to december 2005 are from the dlsp .",
    "two vector magnetograms observed on 09 january 2007 and 06 february 2007 from solar vector magnetograph at udaipur solar observatory ( svm - uso : @xcite ) and reported in @xcite , have also been included to improve the statistics .",
    "all the other data sets obtained since november 2006 onwards are taken from hinode ( sot / sp ) .",
    "we have used the following formula to compute the local @xmath0 values @xmath12 the global @xmath0 value of the active regions is estimated from the following formula as described in @xcite @xmath13    this estimate was shown to be not seriously affected by the polarimetric noise @xcite . moreover , since @xmath14 is weighted by strong field values @xcite and not affected by singularities at polarity inversion lines @xcite , this parameter is more accurate than a simple average of local @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite introduced the shear angle @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the azimuthal angles of observed and potential fields respectively .",
    "the amplitude of this angle was studied at the polarity inversion lines to investigate the flare related changes @xcite . to emphasize the sign of shear angle",
    "we wish to introduce the signed shear angle ( ssa ) for the sunspots as follows : we choose an initial reference azimuth for a current - free field ( obtained from observed line of sight field ) .",
    "then we move to the observed field azimuth from the reference azimuth through an acute angle .",
    "if this rotation is counter - clockwise , then we assign a positive sign for the ssa . a negative sign is given for clockwise rotation .",
    "this sign convention will be consistent with the sense of azimuthal field produced by a vertical current .",
    "this sign convention is also consistent with the sense of chirality ( for details , see appendix a ) .",
    "the potential field has been computed using the method of @xcite .",
    "mean of the ssa obtained for a whole sunspot is taken as the global value of ssa for that sunspot .",
    "the force - free parameter @xmath0 involves three dimensions since it basically represents the rate of change of rotation per unit axial length .",
    "the ssa is the rotational deviation of the projection of the field onto the photosphere from that of a reference current - free field .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is a gradient of angle per unit length while ssa is just an angle .",
    "we therefore can not expect a strong correlation between the amplitudes of both the quantities , the ssa and the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "but we do find a good correlation between their signs as evident from table 1",
    ".    signed shear angle ( ssa ) provides the sign of twist irrespective of whether the photospheric magnetic field is force - free or not .",
    "table 1 shows that the sign of @xmath0 is same as the sign of ssa .",
    "thus , we conclude that even if the photosphere is non force - free , the sign of global @xmath0 will empirically give the sign of global ssa and therefore the sign of global twist ( chirality ) of the sunspots .    to avoid any kind of projection effect we have transformed the data sets to disk center @xcite if the observed sunspot is equal to more than 10 degrees away from the disk center . in some active regions",
    "both the polarities are compact enough to be studied separately .",
    "we have treated each pole of those active regions as an individual sunspot and this is denoted in the table 1 after the noaa no . of sunspots by plus or minus",
    "two examples of the local @xmath0 distribution for the data sets obtained from hinode ( sot / sp ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the positive / negative contours are shown in red / blue colors .",
    "the local @xmath0 patches are seen in the umbra and filamentary distribution of @xmath0 is observed in the penumbral region .",
    "we find that the inclination angles oscillate between @xmath18 30 - 80 degrees when we go along azimuthal direction in the filamentary penumbral structures .",
    "this is consistent with the interlocking - comb penumbral structure @xcite of the penumbral magnetic fields .",
    "the vertical current j@xmath19 has two components , viz .",
    "@xmath20  and   @xmath21 .",
    "if we approximate the observed transverse field ( b@xmath22 ) to be mostly radial ( b@xmath23 ) then we can interpret the azimuthal variation of j@xmath19 to result from the term @xmath20 .",
    "this term is not expected to contribute to global twist",
    ". however @xmath21 could be an important contributor to the global twist .",
    "a detailed investigation of this interesting possibility is deferred to another paper . for the present",
    ", we obtain positive and negative values of current side by side in the penumbra . because the @xmath0 parameter depends on the current , this oscillation in the filamentary structure across the penumbral filaments",
    "is expected for the @xmath0 values too .",
    "the distribution of vertical current and local @xmath0 in the penumbra show higher values than that in the umbral regions .",
    "an arc and a straight line , selected respectively in the penumbra and umbra of ar noaa 10933 have been over plotted as shown in the left panel of figure 1 .",
    "the corresponding values of vertical current and @xmath0 along the arc and the line are shown in the figure 2(a ) and figure 2(b ) respectively .",
    "we can see that both the positive and negative vertical current as well as @xmath0 are equally distributed in the penumbra along the azimuthal direction .",
    "this gives a negligible contribution to the global current and global @xmath0 values thereby indicating that the contribution of @xmath21 is indeed small .",
    "we have selected an arc rather than the complete circle because many times sunspots are not circular and therefore selecting a proper penumbral region is not possible by a full circle .",
    "similar arcs have been selected in the other sunspots and all the time it is seen that both the positive and the negative vertical current as well as @xmath0 are distributed equally in the penumbra giving negligible contribution to their global values .",
    "while current and @xmath0 variations are correlated for positive b@xmath19 , they will be anti correlated for negative b@xmath19 .    figure 2(b )",
    "shows a typical profile of spatial variations of current and @xmath0 across the umbra ( along the line ) in the ar noaa 10933 shown in the left panel of figure 1 .",
    "we see that the amplitude of variation of @xmath0 in the umbra is smaller than that in the penumbra by approximately an order of the magnitude and is of the same order as that of the global @xmath0 value of the whole sunspot .",
    "the current values are not as much smaller than that in the penumbra but are less balanced out than in the penumbra .    in the right panel of figure 1",
    "an arc like structure ( partial ring ) with bunch of red contours ( positive @xmath0 ) can be observed .",
    "this is opposite to that of the dominant negative global @xmath0 of the sunspot .",
    "such partial rings with opposite sign of the global value are observed in 10 of the sunspots from our sample . in the rest of the sunspots",
    "mixed current and @xmath0 are present in the umbra with one dominant sign and no such specific structures are seen at the umbral - penumbral boundaries .",
    "a few sunspots in our data sets studied are small and have no penumbra . some asp data",
    "does nt show fine structures in penumbra due to lack of spatial resolution .",
    "we have included these active regions in our study to look at the hemispheric behaviour of the global twist .",
    "most of the data sets we studied are observed during the declining minimum phase of the solar cycle 23 .",
    "all except five of the sunspots observed do not follow the twist hemispheric rule .",
    "we have introduced the concept of ssa for sunspots and further find that the ssa and the global @xmath0 value of sunspots have the same sign .",
    "thus , @xmath0 gives the same sign as the ssa and therefore the same sign of the photospheric chirality of the sunspots , irrespective of the force - freeness of the sunspot fields .",
    "as can be observed from the table 1 , the magnitudes of ssa and @xmath24 are not well correlated",
    ". this lack of correlation could be due to a variety of reasons : ( a ) departure from the force - free nature ( b ) even for the force - free fields , @xmath0 is the gradient of twist variation whereas ssa is purely an angle .",
    "the missing link is the scale length of variation of twist .",
    "the magnitude of global ssa , therefore , holds promise for characterizing global twist of the sunspot magnetic fields , irrespective of its force - free nature .",
    "patches of vertical current and @xmath0 with opposite signs are present in the umbra of each sunspot studied . since opposite currents repel , the existence of a dominant current may be an useful binding force for the umbra ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this will be examined in detail in further studies of evolution of twist in decaying sunspots .",
    "one sign of @xmath0 dominates in the umbra which is also seen to be the sign of the global @xmath0 of the sunspot .",
    "similarly , the magnitude of the global @xmath0 is of the same order as the amplitude of the local @xmath0 in the umbra .",
    "the filamentary structures of vertical current and local @xmath0 are observed in the penumbra of the sunspots and are , as discussed above , due to oscillatory behaviour in the inclination values and therefore gradients of the transverse field in the azimuthal direction .",
    "we find that the contributions of both positive and negative values of vertical current and @xmath0 to their global values cancel each other in the penumbra of the sunspot .",
    "thus the penumbral fine structures provide a negligible contribution to the global @xmath0 and current values of sunspots .",
    "the mutual repulsion of opposite currents also seem to balance out in the azimuthal direction .",
    "it is to be seen whether disruption of this balance leads to sunspot rotation and change in global twist . at any rate ,",
    "the observed balancing of the filamentary currents in the azimuthal direction may be an important contribution to the force - free nature of the sunspot fields .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath0 variation is approximately an order of magnitude smaller in the umbral regions than that in the penumbral regions and is of the order of the global @xmath0 of the whole sunspot .",
    "partial rings with opposite signs to that of dominant sign of umbral @xmath0 are observed at sunspot umbral - penumbral boundaries in 10 out of 43 sunspots studied .",
    "however even in these few cases , the rings are never complete in any sunspot .",
    "most of the ar s observed do not follow the twist hemispheric rule .",
    "this issue of hemispheric rule needs to be reinvestigated over a longer period as well as with improved data .",
    "some researchers have tried to predict flare activity from local distribution of @xmath0 as well as global @xmath0 values of sunspots ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite concluded from a study of ar 6982 that the global twist present in a sunspot does not influence the flaring activity .",
    "it is rather , governed by the spatial distribution and evolution of twisted sub - structures present in the sunspot .",
    "this conclusion indeed needs more study .",
    "we plan to address , in our forthcoming study , the question of relation between flaring activity and the role of global as well as the local twist present in a large number of sunspots .    for the present",
    ", we demonstrate that the sign of the ssa provides the sign of the photospheric chirality irrespective of its force - free nature .",
    "the sign of the global @xmath0 of a sunspot is determined by the dominant sign of umbral @xmath0 values without much contribution from the penumbral @xmath0 values .     + we thank the referee for very useful comments and suggestions .",
