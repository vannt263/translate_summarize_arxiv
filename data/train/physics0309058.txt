    "generation of high order harmonics of the electromagnetic radiation during an interaction of an ultra - intense laser pulse with underdense and overdense plasmas is a manifestation of one of the most basic nonlinear processes in physics .",
    "high order optical harmonics have been observed in the laser plasma interaction for the laser intensity ranging from a moderate level to relativistic intensities .",
    "high order harmonics attract a great attention due to a wide range of their applications for the diagnostics , the uv and coherent x - ray sources , lithography etc .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . recently , the high order harmonics polarization properties have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to detect the strongest magnetic field generated in the laser plasmas .",
    "different physical mechanisms of high order harmonics generation have much in common because of a property of nonlinear systems to react in an anharmonical manner to a periodic driving force .",
    "on the other hand , specific realization of this property depends on the circumstances of the laser - matter interaction and mainly on the laser intensity . at moderate intensities , generation of high order harmonics",
    "is caused by an atom anharmonic response to an oscillating electric field . at relativistic intensities , the electron quiver energy becomes higher than the rest mass energy and the relativistic nonlinear optics comes into play @xcite .",
    "in this regime high order harmonics generation is due to a nonlinear dependence of the particle mass on its momentum and due to electron density modulations in the electromagnetic wave . in the present paper",
    "we discuss high harmonic generation in collisionless plasmas by a relativistically strong electromagnetic wave .    in the underdense",
    "plasmas an ultra - intense laser pulse causes high harmonics generation through a parametric excitation of electromagnetic and electrostatic waves with different frequencies . in an interaction with overdense plasmas",
    "the laser radiation ( partially ) reflects back at the plasma - vacuum interface , in the case of sharp plasma boundary , or at a critical density surface , in the case of gradual density profile .",
    "the reflecting layer in the plasma is dragged by the electromagnetic wave back and forth in the direction of the incident light , as well as in the transverse direction , forming an oscillating mirror ( see refs .",
    "the light reflected by the oscillating mirror contains odd and even harmonics , whose polarization and amplitudes depend on the incidence angle , intensity and a polarization of the laser pulse .",
    "high efficiency of the laser energy transformation into the energy of high harmonics can be achieved in a scheme , in which the laser pulse propagates inside a hollow channel @xcite . in this case , if the channel is sufficiently long , the laser pulse undergoes a multiple reflection at the plasma - vacuum interface , and a portion of the laser pulse energy transforms into the energy of high harmonics at each reflection event . if the laser pulse propagates inside a hollow channel in a tubiform fiber , the radiation with sufficiently high frequency propagates through the fiber walls .",
    "the fiber walls are transparent for harmonics , whose indices are greater than some critical value . only these harmonics are emitted from the fiber at certain angle with respect to the fiber axis .",
    "this approach allows one to design a high frequency radiation source with controlled properties , which depend on the fiber diameter and the fiber wall thickness .",
    "we call this source `` the relativistic whistle '' .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a propagation of an ultra - intense short laser pulse in a fiber , with an aim to study the properties of the high harmonic radiation . here",
    "we use the two dimensional approximation , leaving the investigation of the 3d problem for forthcoming publications .",
    "in the two - dimensional case the fiber corresponds to two thin foils of a finite length .",
    "the foils are parallel to each other , and to the x - axis in the @xmath0-plane .",
    "let the wall thickness of the foil is @xmath1 , and a distance between the foils equal to @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the foils to be made of the collisionless overdense plasma with the electron density @xmath3 .",
    "such a configuration can be formed by an ultra - intense femtosecond laser pulse interacting with the solid density fiber , when the fiber wall material is ionized during the first half - period of the laser pulse , and the length of the laser pulse is much shorter than the timescale of a hydrodynamic expansion of the plasma . in the framework of this approximation we can assume the ions to be at rest .    from the dispersion equation , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the wave frequency and @xmath6",
    ", we find the group velocity of the wave inside the channel , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the matching conditions for the wave inside the channel , and the wave radiated outwards , show that all the outgoing waves propagate at the angle @xmath10 with respect to the channel axis , independently of the wave frequency .",
    "the fact that all the outgoing waves have the same angle of propagation can be demonstrated in a different way .",
    "after the lorentz transform into the reference frame moving at a speed of @xmath11 along the @xmath12axis , the @xmath12component of the fundamental mode wave vector vanishes : @xmath13 ( see for details refs .",
    "the problem becomes one - dimensional . therefore high frequency waves excited by the fundamental mode at the plasma - vacuum interface also have zero @xmath12component of the wave vector in this reference frame .",
    "they propagate outwards in the direction perpendicular to the fiber walls . performing the inverse",
    "transform back to the laboratory reference frame , we obtain that all the outgoing waves propagate at the same angle @xmath14 with respect to the channel axis , independently of the wave frequency .",
    "their energy is localized inside a slab co - moving with the laser pulse along the @xmath12axis .",
    "the slab length is equal to the length of the laser pulse .",
    "its transverse size depends on the effective length of the interaction . according to the selection rules of the harmonic generation at each wall ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the @xmath15polarized fundamental mode in the fiber generates @xmath15polarized odd harmonics and @xmath16polarized even harmonics of radiation .",
    "the @xmath16polarized fundamental mode generates only @xmath16polarized harmonics of radiation .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath17-th harmonic can be found in the approximation of an infinitely thin walls of the fibre ( see ref .",
    "it is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are amplitudes of the fundamental mode and of the @xmath17-th harmonic , respectively .",
    "the transformation coefficient @xmath21 is given by @xmath22^n$ ] , in the limit @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the dimensionless amplitude of the fundamental mode , @xmath25 is the dimensionless parameter ( relativistic transparency measure ) , @xmath26 is the frequency of the fundamental mode .",
    "we perform computer simulations using the two - dimensional version of particle - in - cell relativistic electromagnetic code remp , based on ` density decomposition ' scheme @xcite .",
    "computation box has a size @xmath27 .",
    "since the problem of high harmonic generation requires substantially high spatial resolution , the computation mesh has 50 cells per @xmath28 .",
    "the number of quasiparticles per cell is equal to 16 in the plasma region .",
    "the channel walls have a length @xmath29 and width @xmath30 , a distance between the walls is @xmath31 .",
    "the ions are assumed to be immobile and the electron density is equal to @xmath32 , where the critical density is @xmath33 .",
    "since the channel diameter is less than the laser light wavelength , only the @xmath34-polarized electromagnetic wave ( whose electric field is directed along the @xmath35-axis ) can propagate inside the channel .",
    "for the parameters chosen , only harmonic , whose index is higher than 4 , can propagate through the walls .",
    "this conclusion follows from the boundary conditions for the electromagnetic wave , which is obliquely incident on the plasma - vacuum interface , at the angle @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath34-polarized laser pulse is initialized in a vacuum region at the left hand side from the channel entry .",
    "the pulse aperture is f/1 , its length is equal to @xmath36 , and its dimensionless amplitude at the @xmath37 focus spot is @xmath38 , which corresponds to the intensity @xmath39w/@xmath40 .",
    "these parameters are close to the parameters of the laser in the cuos at the university of michigan @xcite .",
    "we notice here that the pulse focusing into the @xmath37 spot is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our simulation model the entry of the channel",
    "is smoothed to decrease the laser pulse reflection .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the focusing laser pulse and the fiber .",
    "we see that the smoothing of the channel entry provides almost reflectionless matching of the laser pulse and the channel .     the electromagnetic energy density and the plasma density distribution at @xmath41 when the pulse enters into the fiber .",
    "when the laser pulse propagates inside the channel a portion of its energy is reflected back due to the process similar to the stimulated raman scattering in the plasma of the channel walls ; a portion of its energy is transformed into the energy of high harmonic waves radiated outwards ; the remaining part of the laser pulse propagates through the channel toward the end of the fiber , then it goes out as a diverging electromagnetic wave .",
    "these successive phases are seen in fig .",

    "]    we perform the spatial fourier transform of the @xmath35-component of the electric field inside a sub - domain ( @xmath51 ; @xmath52 ) at @xmath53 . the resulting spectrum of the @xmath34-polarized light inside this sub - domain is presented in fig .",
    "we see the odd harmonics with the harmonic index @xmath54 .",
    "the spectrum peaks are arranged along the straight line given by @xmath55 , i. e. the angle of propagation is smaller than @xmath56 .",
