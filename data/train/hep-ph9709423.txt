    "one - loop calculations are important in the quest for discovering new physics beyond the standard model , especially for determining qcd backgrounds .",
    "a number of significant improvements in the calculation of one - loop amplitudes , especially ones with massless particles , have been made in recent years .",
    "these methods , which have recently been reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , include the use of helicity @xcite , color decompositions @xcite , string - inspired ideas @xcite , recursion relations @xcite , unitarity @xcite and factorization @xcite .",
    "besides allowing for the computation of certain infinite sequences of amplitudes , these techniques have been used in the computation of non - trivial amplitudes relevant for phenomenological applications @xcite .",
    "a technique that has proven to be especially useful is that of using unitarity to determine the functional form of the amplitudes . by working to all orders in the dimensional regularization parameter , @xmath1",
    ", one can determine the coefficients of all integral functions that may appear @xcite . for certain amplitudes that satisfy a power counting criterion , such as supersymmetric ones",
    ", one can show that cuts with four - dimensional momenta are sufficient to determine the amplitudes through @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the case of an amplitude with massive internal legs has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the unitarity method stems from the use of gauge invariant tree amplitudes in performing calculations . with the use of helicity and color decompositions",
    "this can lead to enormous reductions in the complexity of intermediate expressions .",
    "this may be contrasted against calculations of individual feynman diagrams that are gauge variant , where large cancelations must take place in order obtain simpler gauge invariant results .    in this paper",
    "we will show how to evaluate feynman diagrams so as to obtain efficiency of computation inherent in the unitarity technique .",
    "this is done by performing feynman diagram calculations in a particular way so as to mimic the unitarity approach advocated in ref .",
    "one may therefore start with feynman diagrams , yet obtain the advantages of the cutkosky approach .",
    "this is useful since it explains the unitarity method from a conventional feynman diagram viewpoint .",
    "this is of interest in , for example , the extension of unitarity methods beyond one loop , such as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as an explicit example we have calculated the one - loop helicity amplitudes for @xmath3 .",
    "this example has the desirable features that it contains both colored and colorless lines and massive internal and external legs .",
    "this example is useful since it illustrates features beyond purely massless calculations , where most attention has been concentrated @xcite .",
    "also it has already been evaluated via conventional methods by r.k .",
    "ellis et  al .",
    "@xcite , allowing for an easy comparison to the correct result to be made .",
    "we find agreement with their result .",
    "we now briefly review some of the techniques that we shall use in this paper .",
    "two important techniques that we utilize are spinor helicity and color decomposition .",
    "the reader may consult review articles @xcite for further details .      in explicit calculations with external gluons ,",
    "it is usually convenient to use a spinor helicity basis @xcite which rewrites all polarization vectors in terms of massless weyl spinors @xmath4 . in the formulation of xu , zhang and",
    "chang the plus and minus helicity polarization vectors are expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the momentum of the gluon and @xmath7 is an arbitrary null ` reference momentum ' which drops out of the final gauge invariant amplitudes .",
    "we use the convenient notation @xmath8 \\ , .",

    "it is convenient to choose a dimensional regularization scheme that is compatible with the spinor helicity formalism .",
    "we use the four - dimensional helicity scheme @xcite which is equivalent to a helicity form of siegel s dimensional reduction scheme @xcite .",
    "the conversion between the various dimensional regularization schemes has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "color decompositions @xcite have been extensively discussed in review articles @xcite .",
    "here we only present the color decomposition for the @xmath3 amplitude .",
    "for this one - loop amplitude the decomposition is@xmath13 \\ , a^f_4 ( \\si(1 ) , \\si(2 ) , \\si(3 ) , h ) \\",
    ", ,   \\equn\\label{decomp}\\ ] ] where we have taken the loop to be in the fundamental representation .",
    "the sum over @xmath14 includes all cyclic permutations of the indices @xmath15 ( i.e. @xmath16 ) and the @xmath17 are fundamental representation color matrices ( normalized so that @xmath18 ) .",
    "we have abbreviated the dependence of @xmath19 on the outgoing momenta @xmath20 and helicities @xmath21 by writing the label @xmath22 alone .",
    "we have also explicitly extracted the coupling and a factor of @xmath23 from @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the renormalization scale .",
    "for adjoint representation loops there is an analogous decomposition with up to two color traces in each term .",
    "it is convenient to further decompose the partial amplitude in terms of _ primitive amplitudes _ ,",
    "@xmath26 in the primitive amplitudes appearing on the right - hand - side we may treat the higgs as carrying color charge ( in the adjoint representation ) , which couples to gluons ; it is not difficult to show in the permutation sum all such additional terms cancel .",
    "this is convenient since these primitive amplitudes are gauge invariant and have a fixed cyclic ordering of external legs .",
    "a similar decomposition in terms of ` primitive amplitudes ' can also be performed for the case where some of the external particles are in the fundamental representation @xcite .",
    "feynman diagrams , which have been essential for evaluating terms in the perturbative series for scattering processes , suffer from a number of well known computational difficulties .",
    "firstly , individual feynman diagrams are inherently gauge dependent ; gauge invariance is restored only after summing over all diagrams . secondly , when evaluating loop momentum integrals using traditional techniques , such as passarino - veltman reduction @xcite , one encounters a large number of spurious denominators .",
    "these spurious denominators typically involve gram determinants , @xmath27 raised to a power .",
    "enormous cancelations must then take place before one obtains relatively simple results .",
    "when using conventional techniques to evaluate feynman diagrams one reduces all tensor integrals into sums of scalar integrals multiplied by reduction coefficients .",
    "( by a tensor integral we mean loop momentum integrals with powers of momentum in the numerator and by a scalar integral we mean integrals with no powers of loop momentum in the numerator , see . ) with the knowledge of how this reduction works , given any one - loop amplitude we can list all the scalar integrals that could potentially enter .",
    "thus we have @xmath28 where the subscript @xmath29 is some index that labels the scalar integrals that contribute to this amplitude .",
    "the heart of the calculation is in evaluating all the coefficients of the scalar integrals , i.e. the @xmath30 s .    a conventional feynman diagram technique like passarino - veltman ( pv ) reduction evaluates all the necessary coefficients simultaneously .",
    "if one could obtain these coefficients in a more efficient manner one would greatly improve the ability to calculate .",
    "some of the features that are useful in improved calculational methods are : ( 1 ) that the building blocks be gauge invariant combinations of diagrams instead of individual diagrams ; ( 2 ) that wherever possible tensor integrals should not generate large powers of gram determinants in denominators ; ( 3 ) that large cancelations between diagrams be avoided as much as possible ; ( 4 ) and that calculations can be recycled when performing new ones .",
    "the cutting method reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite has these above properties . in this method one",
    "writes down the cuts in a given channel , depicted in , @xmath31 this equation is valid only for the cut channel under consideration .",
    "the loop momentum is @xmath32 ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the momenta of the cut propagators , with masses @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively and @xmath37 .",
    "one then reconstructs the complete amplitude by finding a function which has the correct cuts in _ all _ channels .    -1.75",
    "cm    since the loop integral in is composed of products of on - shell tree amplitudes , the basic building blocks are gauge invariant .",
    "these tree amplitudes are inherently easier to calculate than loop amplitudes and in many cases have been previously calculated .",
    "a key feature of the cutting method is that a specific subset of scalar integral coefficients are obtained in any given channel",
    ". then one repeats this process for various channels thus computing the coefficients for all the scalar integrals .",
    "there are integrals that do not appear in any channel , namely the tadpole and scalar bubble integrals , @xmath38 however , with prior knowledge of the infrared and ultraviolet behavior of an amplitude in many cases the coefficients of these integrals can be fixed , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is generally convenient to express the tree amplitudes in using the spinor helicity formalism discussed in .",
    "then one can evaluate the right - hand side of by constructing spinor strings of the form @xmath39 , and then commuting the @xmath40 towards each other .",
    "this generates terms of the form @xmath41 , which may be rewritten as differences of inverse propagators and terms which do not depend on the loop momentum .",
    "this type of reduction procedure has been previously used in a number of references @xcite .",
    "we shall make use of it in the next section .    -.75",
    "cm    when using spinor helicity one must take into account that the momenta of the intermediate on - shell lines are in @xmath42 dimensions while the helicity formalism is defined in four dimensions .",
    "if one drops the @xmath43-dimensional components of the momenta , one could make an error in rational functions arising from @xmath44 terms . for five- and higher - point calculations it can be more convenient to use four - dimensional momenta in the cuts , but then to reconstruct the missing rational functions using collinear and multi - particle factorization properties @xcite . for four - point calculations it is convenient to keep terms to all orders in  @xmath45 , since factorization is insufficient to fix all rational functions .",
    "the cases of fermion or scalar lines with @xmath42 momenta in the helicity formalism have been extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and do not present any difficulties .",
    "although it is unnecessary for the specific calculation @xmath46 , a convenient strategy for handling channels with gluon lines is to subtract and add equivalent diagrams with internal gluon lines replaced by scalar or fermion lines , as depicted in . in some cases",
    "one uses fermions so as to group particles together with supersymmetric partners .",
    "such combinations of diagrams satisfy the power counting criterion that @xmath47-point tensor integrals should have ( for @xmath48 ) at most @xmath49 powers of loop momentum in the numerator of the integrand ; two - point integrals should have at most one power of loop momentum .",
    "the required rearrangement of the diagrams to make the power count apparent is discussed in ref .",
    "in particular , for the example portrayed in one should use background field feynman gauge @xcite .",
    "the origin of this power counting criterion is from the requirement that all contributions due to the @xmath50 parts of loop momenta should not interfere with ultraviolet poles to yield @xmath2 contributions .",
    "( one can also show that infrared divergences never interfere with the @xmath50 parts of loop momenta @xcite . )",
    "this criterion also holds for the general massive amplitudes discussed in this paper .",
    "this is useful since one can then take the sewed gluon lines to have four - dimensional momenta without any errors through @xmath2 .",
    "we now describe how to perform a feynman diagram calculation so as to mimic the cutting method . in the next section we give an explicit example involving both internal and external masses .",
    "the basic idea is rather simple .    given that we know all the scalar integrals that could possibly enter a one - loop amplitude , suppose we target those scalar integrals that have a pair of scalar propagators @xmath51",
    "where @xmath33 is the momentum of the scalar propagator between external legs @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and @xmath34 is between @xmath54 and @xmath55 of a general @xmath47-point amplitude , where the indicated propagators are each of a specific particle type . in order to generate a scalar integral with a specific propagator one",
    "must necessarily have evaluated a feynman diagram that has the corresponding propagator .",
    "we can define a channel ( this channel will correspond to the cut - channel when the cut is performed on the indicated legs ) as a subset of the terms in the full amplitude ; the terms being the scalar integrals which include the pair of scalar propagators mentioned above together with their corresponding coefficients , the @xmath30 s .    in each feynman integral ( the tensor integral corresponding to each feynman diagram ) we explicitly extract a denominator that includes the pair of scalar propagators under consideration .",
    "then if we impose the on - shell conditions @xmath56 to the numerators of all the feynman integrals contributing to the amplitude then the result would yield exactly what we defined as a channel in the previous paragraph .",
    "the potential errors when imposing these on - shell conditions would necessarily be of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and/or @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath61 and @xmath62 are themselves inverse scalar propagators , anything of the form of could only generate terms which are not in the channel under consideration .",
    "this is because one or both of the inverse propagators would cancel a scalar propagator in the denominator and generate a scalar integral not included in the specified channel , i.e. that does not include both of the indicated scalar propagators . setting @xmath56 only affects the calculation of those terms not in the specified channel . thus the evaluation of the @xmath30 s that are in the specified channel are not affected by imposing the on - shell condition .",
    "by systematically stepping through a sufficient number of channels one can fix all the coefficients , the @xmath30 s in . in this way we can reconstruct the full amplitude . for some coefficients",
    "the corresponding integrals appear in multiple channels ; for consistency these must coincide .",
    "so how does using the on - shell conditions @xmath56 in the numerator help us in evaluating the feynman diagrams ?",
    "all feynman diagrams in a specific channel can now be ` factorized ' using their on - shell legs into the sewing of two feynman tree diagrams ( see ) .",
    "-.75 cm    in figure the ` factorized ' feynman graph only contains intermediate on - shell fermions for the @xmath46 amplitude .",
    "but in general this ` factorization ' process can be performed on any one - loop feynman diagram . with on - shell scalars or fermions",
    "it is clear that this can be done . with intermediate massless gauge particles",
    "one might worry that one has forgotten about the contributions of diagrams with ghosts on the right hand side of .",
    "we know , however , that the net effect of the one - loop diagrams with ghosts is to cancel the unphysical polarizations of graphs with corresponding gauge particles .",
    "this cancelation can be made apparent using the background field feynman gauge @xcite .",
    "however , once one has ` factorized ' a feynman graph on a pair of propagators that includes a gauge particle then the contribution of the ghosts is not necessary as the sewing of the two on - shell feynman trees manifestly has no unphysical gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "if one sums over all the feynman diagrams that contribute to a specific channel and we impose the on - shell condition then the equivalent equation to would have on - shell tree amplitudes sewed together instead of on - shell feynman trees : @xmath63    the sum on the right - hand side runs over all helicity states that can propagate across the ` cut ' legs . using the above equation one can compute all the coefficients of the scalar integrals that appear in this channel .",
    "the above equation , , is the unitarity method mentioned earlier in this section .",
    "originally the method was inspired by cutkosky rules , however , from the arguments presented here it is clear that one can evaluate feynman diagrams in a sophisticated manner so as to take advantage of the benefits inherent in the unitarity method . instead of performing the calculation of the scalar integral coefficients in parallel , we perform the calculation by targeting simultaneously only those integrals in a given channel .    the notion of channels presented in this section is more general than that of just considering cutkosky rules because we may use the on - shell conditions on any propagator which does not collapse in the integral function under consideration .",
    "( indeed , this observation has already been used in calculations of @xmath64 partons @xcite . ) in general we could construct a channel where we use the on - shell condition for any number of propagators ( it is even possible to construct a channel where the on - shell condition is used for a single propagator ) ; however , it is normally convenient to use only the two - propagator channel construction .",
    "in this section we apply the procedure outlined in the previous section to the specific example of @xmath66 .",
    "this amplitude has one massive external leg and all the feynman diagrams have a massive quark running in the loop .",
    "see for the color - ordered feynman diagrams contributing to this amplitude .",
    "-.75 cm    in there are two feynman diagrams that involve a higgs - higgs - gluon coupling which does not exist in the standard model .",
    "as mentioned in , although these diagrams cancel from the final result , they make the primitive amplitudes ( which have a fixed ordering of external legs ) gauge invariant . of course",
    ", one does not need to include the extra diagrams , but then one would need to sum over the permutations with all possible external orderings of the higgs , as in , to recover gauge invariance .    as mentioned in by observing the feynman diagrams in we can write down all the scalar integrals that can enter the amplitude , see .    -.75",
    "cm    the integrals are two- , three- and four - point scalar integrals that have massive internal propagators and some combination of massive external kinematics .",
    "one - point tadpole integrals do not appear since they are forbidden by power counting .",
    "( when using passarino - veltman reduction one could encounter such integrals , but they must cancel in the final expressions for this amplitude since one does not encounter them when using feynman parameterization . ) the scalar integrals are found in .",
    "in addition to the use of color decomposition , , it is also convenient to decompose the primitive amplitudes into all possible external helicity configurations .",
    "so the objects that need to be computed are the color ordered gauge invariant primitive amplitudes .",
    "there are three such objects ; they are @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the other primitive amplitudes ( e.g. @xmath70 ) can be obtained from the above three primitive amplitudes using parity and relabelings .    since this amplitude has already been calculated by ellis et  al .",
    "@xcite the purpose of the calculation is to explicitly demonstrate that we may obtain the correct results by applying the unitarity method to massive amplitudes , starting from feynman diagrams . for illustrative purposes , only the calculation of @xmath67",
    "is explicitly presented here  the results of the calculation of the other two primitive amplitudes are shown for completeness .      in order to compute the primitive amplitude @xmath67",
    "we will construct it from multiple channels .",
    "we will see that it is sufficient to only compute the @xmath71- and @xmath72-channels .",
    "the mandelstam variables are defined as @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "these channels can be seen in .",
    "-0.5 cm     we begin by first constructing the @xmath71-channel by sewing together the two tree amplitudes on the left- and right - hand side of a. this corresponds to targeting the coefficients , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 in .",
    "the tree amplitude on the right of a is given by @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the helicity projection operator and the tree amplitude on the left is given by @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the vacuum expectation value of the scalar higgs field @xcite , @xmath83 is the mass of the fermion in the loop and @xmath84 is the scalar higgs mass",
    ". capitalized momenta are @xmath42-dimensional , lower case momenta are four - dimensional and @xmath85 is the @xmath86-dimensional part of the loop momentum .",
    "( see and . ) in these tree amplitudes we follow the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite for massive spinors , summarized in . in this convention",
    "the distinction between fermion and anti - fermion spinors is suppressed .    as depicted in a , for the @xmath71-channel the momenta of the on - shell legs are @xmath87 the second tree amplitude , , involving the higgs has been constructed from the tree level feynman diagrams including the additional fictitious higgs - higgs - gluon coupling ( this is the standard scalar - scalar - vector coupling of scalar qed @xcite ) mentioned earlier .",
    "so sewing the two tree amplitudes together gives us the @xmath71-channel of the amplitude @xmath88 where the denominators are @xmath89[(\\ell_1-k_1)^2-\\mu^2-m^2 ] [ ( \\ell_1-k_1-k_2)^2-\\mu^2-m^2 ] \\cr \\d_4 = \\ : & [ \\ell_1 ^ 2-\\mu^2-m^2][(\\ell_1-k_1)^2-\\mu^2-m^2 ] [ ( \\ell_1-k_1-k_2)^2-\\mu^2-m^2][(\\ell_1+k_4)^2-\\mu^2-m^2 ] \\",
