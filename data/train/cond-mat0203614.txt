    "<S> femtosecond pump probe experiments are reported on quasiparticle relaxation and recombination in ysr@xmath0ba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 as a function of temperature and polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the data show a 2-component relaxation similar to yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 , one component being assocated with the superconducting transition , and the other with the pseudogap below @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation time @xmath8 associated with the pseudogap is found to be @xmath9-independent , while the relaxation time @xmath10 of the component obseved only below @xmath11 exhibits a clear divergence near @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> a strong polarisation anisotropy of the picosecond transient is observed below @xmath11 which is attributed to the anisotropy of the probe transition matrix elements .    </S>",
    "<S> femtosecond time - domain spectroscopy is capable of giving important information on the quasi - particle excitations and a low - energy structure of correlated electron systems , and particularly high-@xmath11 superconducting cuprates ( htsc ) . </S>",
    "<S> measurements on yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( y123 ) at different doping levels have shown two - component relaxation dynamics on the picosecond timescale , that was attributed to the simultaneous existence of two gaps in optimally doped and overdoped regions @xcite . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> similar two - component relaxation dynamics has been thus far observed in several htsc @xcite , suggesting this being a general feature in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude and sign of the two components at temperatures below @xmath11 were found to depend on the material , probe wavelength @xcite , and also the effects of probe polarization dependence were investigated on untwinned y123 single - crystals @xcite , where a response parallel and perpendicular to the cu - o chains was separately probed and found to be different . in some cases ( tl2201@xcite , bi2212 @xcite )  the signs of the different components observed in the relaxation were opposite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the anisotropy of the photoinduced signal with respect to the probe pulse polarization has not been discussed in detail thus far .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is two fold . </S>",
    "<S> first , we show that the 2-component relaxation behavior observed in y123  is similar also in yba@xmath4cu@xmath2o@xmath12 ( y124 ) , and second , utilizing the fact that y124 has a fixed oxygen content and a well - defined untwinned orthorhombic structure , to probe the polarization dependence of the photoinduced signal .    </S>",
    "<S> we report on a systematic investigation of y124  and yba@xmath13sr@xmath14cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( y124:sr ) using the usual femtosecond time - resolved pump - probe technique . as discussed in detail </S>",
    "<S> previously @xcite , a short ( @xmath1580fs ) pump laser pulse excites the carriers in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> photoexcited electrons and holes with energies on the order of photon energy quickly thermalize via electron - electron and electron - phonon thermalization , reaching states just above the gap in a time short compared to the pulse duration . </S>",
    "<S> the gap in the density of states presents a relaxation bottleneck , and the relaxation of photoexcited carrier density near e@xmath16 is measured through measurement of small changes in the optical reflectivity @xmath17 or transmittance @xmath18 of the sample as a function of a time - delay between the pump and probe pulses . in these experiments , </S>",
    "<S> a ti : sapphire mode - locked laser , which operated at  a 78 mhz  repetition rate , was used as a source of both pump and probe light pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength of the pulses was centered at approximately @xmath19 @xmath20 800 nm ( 1.58ev ) and the intensity ratio of pump and probe pulses was approximately 100:1 . </S>",
    "<S> the pump and probe beams were crossed on the sample s surface , where the angle of incidence of both beams was less than 10@xmath21 . the diameter  of both beams on the surface was @xmath22100@xmath23 m and the surface was parallel to a ab - crystal plane . </S>",
    "<S> the typical energy of pump pulses was 0.2nj ( 1.25@xmath24ev ) , which produces a weak perturbation of the electronic system with </S>",
    "<S> approximately 3@xmath25 thermalized photoexcited carriers per pulse . </S>",
    "<S> ( the approximation is based on the assumption that each photon creates @xmath26 thermalized photoexcited carriers , where @xmath27mev is of the order of the superconducting gap . ) </S>",
    "<S> the train of the pump pulses was modulated at 200khz  with an acousto - optic modulator and the small optical changes were resolved out of noise with the aid of phase - sensitive detection using eg@xmath28 g digital lock - in amplifier model 7265 . </S>",
    "<S> the pump and probe beams were also cross - polarized to reduce scattering of pump beam into the detector ( avalanche photodiode ) .  a detailed description of the experimental technique and the theory of excitation and relaxation of the photoexcited carriers in superconductors with different gap structures can be found in refs . </S>",

    "<S> this angular dependance can be understood in terms of the anisotropy of the probe transition matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> we first note that in spite of the fact that y124 is orthorhombic , the main contribution to the probe signal comes from interband resonance transitions @xcite which involves atomic wave functions in which the dipolar matrix elements have a 4-fold rotational symmetry around the @xmath77 axis . without specifying exactly which transitions are involved , </S>",
    "<S> we can write the absorption coefficient in terms of the fermi golden rule : @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the density of electronic states , @xmath80 is the distribution function for holes , @xmath81 is the energy of the probe photons and @xmath82 is the dipole matrix element for the transition . for small perturbations , @xmath83 is proportional to the photoinduced absorption @xmath84 , so : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the nonequilibrium distribution function of the charge carriers . the integral </S>",

    "<S> the same is true for the hole transitions and ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) .    turning to the situation in hand , we assume that @xmath99 is not constant and  proceed to derive an expression for the polarization anisotropy of the probe absorption . </S>",

    "<S> an alternative model discussing carrier relaxation dynamics in htsc has been recently proposed @xcite , whereby the main contribution to @xmath115 in the region at @xmath116 ev comes from spectral weight transfer in the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath117 from @xmath118 to @xmath119 . since @xmath120 is always positive this leads to negative changes in the real part of the dielectric function , independent of polarization . </S>",
