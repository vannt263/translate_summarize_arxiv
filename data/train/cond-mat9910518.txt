    "although the excitonic matter as a research object has already a relatively long history , dating back to pioneer theoretical ideas in the sixties @xcite , the study of small excitonic complexes confined in regions of nanometer scale became possible only recently , and is closely related to dramatic advances in semiconductor technology .",
    "due to the smallness of the exciton lifetime in semiconductors ( hundreds of picoseconds , sometimes even greater ) , signatures of excitonic complexes are looked for mainly in optical experiments .",
    "exciton and biexciton peaks in photoluminescence have been identified in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "recently , a confocal microscopy technique has been applied to resolve the luminescence coming from a single self - assembled quantum dot @xcite .",
    "the power of the excitation laser is such that up to six pairs are excited simultaneously in the dot .",
    "clearly distinct lines coming from transitions between multiexcitonic complexes are identified .",
    "the calculations presented in our paper , although unrealistic , are inspired by the experimental work @xcite .",
    "we address a different question , i. e. the dependence of the ground - state energy on the number of pairs . from this dependence , the lowest optical absorption line related to the creation of an electron - hole pair in the background of @xmath3 photo - excited pairs",
    "may be extracted .    on the other hand ,",
    "small excitonic systems have been widely studied theoretically in order to describe the optical properties of bulk and low - dimensional semiconductors .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , one of the most complete studies is the paper @xcite , in which a variational approach is used to compute the properties of two- and tridimensional free ( not confined ) excitons with up to five particles .",
    "our work has also a close connection with that paper .    by using the bethe - goldstone ( bg ) equation to compute the ground - state energies , we are able to rise the number of particles in the complex from a maximum of five in the variational approach @xcite to 24 .",
    "asymmetric systems with @xmath2 are studied as well . in the weak confinement regime",
    ", we can also address the question about the stability of the free complexes . and",
    "in fact , our results give indications that the free triexciton and the four - exciton system are unstable ( or weakly bound ) , whereas the higher complexes are stable .",
    "these properties have a distinct trace in the optical absorption , and may be confirmed by the experiments .",
    "the present paper is complementary to @xcite , in which a bcs variational approach is used to study intermediate - size complexes , containing from 12 to 180 particles .",
    "for those sizes where both approaches overlap , as a rule bcs gives lower energy values for strong confinement , whereas bg gives better energies in the weak confinement regime .",
    "we will study a two - dimensional model of @xmath0 electrons and @xmath1 holes confined by a parabolic potential in the plane of motion , and interacting _ via _ pure coulomb potentials .",
    "only one conduction and one valence band , both ideally parabolic , will be considered , and the masses of holes and electrons will be supposed to be equal . by choosing the scales of distances and energies as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we get the dimensionless hamiltonian    @xmath6 , \\label{hamilton}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath7 are in - plane coordinates for the particles , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the frequency of the confining potential , @xmath10 is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the characteristic coulomb energy .",
    "@xmath13 is the only parameter entering the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) .",
    "it may be thought of as the inverse of the confinement strength . in the @xmath14 limit",
    ", we have a picture of non - interacting fermions which energy levels and one - particle quantum states are those of the @xmath15 harmonic oscillator . the electron ( hole )",
    "states are grouped into shells with `` magic numbers '' @xmath16 .",
    "as @xmath13 grows , correlations between particles become more and more important and the previous picture is modified .",
    "one way to go beyond the independent - particle picture is the independent - pair approximation in which an exact treatment of the two - body correlations is made .",
    "its main component is the bethe - goldstone ( bg ) equation , extensively used in nuclear matter and finite nucleus calculations @xcite .",
    "the bg equation applies only to fermionic systems .",
    "it describes the motion of an independent pair of fermions in the system .",
    "the rest of the particles excerpt an indirect influence on the pair motion through the pauli principle .",
    "the equation takes the form :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 label the states of each fermion in the pair .",
    "these states are below the fermi level .",
    "the @xmath20 are the one - particle terms in the hamiltonian , @xmath21 is the two - body interaction potential ( coulomb ) , and @xmath22 is a projection operator given by    @xmath23    where the sum runs over states above the fermi level .",
    "@xmath24 projects a given function onto states over the fermi level .",
    "@xmath25 is the unsymmetrized product of two non - interacting one - particle eigenfunctions ( we use the notation given in @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath26 is the pair energy , and @xmath27  its wave function",
    ".    equation ( [ b - g ] ) is formally similar to a pair scattering equation , except for the presence of the projection operator ( and the fact that all of the states in the external quadratic potential are bound states ) .",
    "the pair wave function @xmath27 is looked for in the form    @xmath28    and the total energy is computed from    @xmath29    where @xmath30 .",
    "the corrections coming from the bg equations are proven to be equivalent to summing up all the ladder diagrams in the linked - cluster expansion for the energy @xcite .    multiplying ( [ b - g ] ) from the left by @xmath31 or @xmath32 ,",
    "we get    @xmath33    equation ( [ sys ] ) may be seen as a linear system of equations for the coefficients @xmath34 , from which we obtain @xmath35 .",
    "then , the transcendental equation ( [ tras ] ) is solved for @xmath26 .",
    "one shall notice that the coulomb interaction does not change neither the angular momentum of the pair nor the spin of the particles .",
    "the matrix elements are real and have the following properties :    @xmath36    due to these properties , the matrix entering the linear system is symmetric .    in order to solve the bg equation we have to identify , given an initial pair , all the possible final states above the fermi level preserving angular momentum and spin .",
    "then we solve the linear system and the transcendental equation to get the pair energy .",
    "one shall take into account that there are three kinds of pairs in the system , namely e - e , h - h and e - h . in the second term of ( [ energy ] )",
    ", @xmath37 means that for identical particles ( e - e and h - h ) a state @xmath38 should be counted only once . for e - h pairs , however , we should take into account the two possibilities , i. e. @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    in our calculations , up to 272 harmonic - oscillator one - particle states ( 16 shells )",
    "are included .",
    "whenever possible , the e - h , spatial inversion and time - reversal symmetries are used to reduce the actual number of equations to solve .",
    "for example , in the @xmath41 problem , 15 systems of linear equations with roughly 700 unknowns each , and 15 nonlinear equations for the pair energies are solved .",
    "in this section we present the results obtained for symmetric systems , where @xmath43 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is varied in the interval ( 0 ,  2.5 ) .",
    "the first step in our bethe - goldstone calculation is to define filled and empty levels , i. e. the fermi surface . to this end",
    ", a hartree - fock calculation was implemented .",
    "the harmonic - oscillator states were filled in accordance with the hartree - fock results . we show them in spectroscopic ( nuclear ) notation in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "@xmath44 , for example , means the second level with @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 , and @xmath47 refer to the total electron and hole spins respectively , and @xmath48 is the total angular momentum ( along the @xmath49-axis ) .      for the biexciton ,",
    "our starting configuration is one in which the first harmonic oscillator shell is filled for both electron and holes ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this state has zero total angular momentum and total spin . in order to write down the bethe - goldstone equations we shall identify all possible pairs below the fermi level . in the e - e and h - h sectors",
    "there is only one pair , but we have 4 e - h pairs . for a given initial pair ,",
    "the number of final pair states above the fermi level depends on the number of harmonic oscillator shells , @xmath50 , included in the calculations .",
    "figure 1 shows the results for the energy as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath50 .",
    "the solid line is a two - point pad approximant , which construction is described below .",
    "a few remarks shall be given at this point .",
    "first , notice that the convergence is slow .",
    "second , the bg results do not exactly reproduce the perturbative energies at small values of @xmath13 .",
    "it means simply that the characteristic distances are much smaller than the characteristic pair dimensions , and thus the independent pair approximation breaks down .",
    "fortunately , in this strong - confinement regime the energy is dominated by the one - particle energies , which are properly accounted for by the bg approach . finally , the bg energies are seem to overestimate the actual binding energies at large @xmath13 .",
    "the two - point pad approximant for the ground - state energy is constructed in the following way@xcite .",
    "the asymptotic expansions    @xmath51    @xmath52    are used , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xcite , and @xmath56 @xcite , @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is the ground - state energy of the free biexciton in two dimensions , and @xmath59 comes from the center of mass oscillation , contributing with a one to the ground - state energy .",
    "the two - point approximant is a rational function interpolating between ( [ serienul ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) :    @xmath60    the values of the parameters are the following , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "next , we present results for @xmath65 and 12 , computed with @xmath66 .",
    "the occupied harmonic - oscillator states are indicated in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "note that , in some cases , the hartree - fock approximation does not suggest a unique state , thus we performed bg calculations with different occupations , and select the one corresponding to the minimal energy .",
    "for example , in the @xmath67 system we performed calculations also for a configuration very similar to the one given in table [ tab1 ] , but with total momentum l=2 .",
    "the results are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in a `` scaled '' form , i. e. @xmath68 vs. @xmath69 .",
    "this scaling comes from the dependence @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 for large @xmath3@xcite , but it is nicely satisfied even for the smallest systems . in this scaled drawing , the @xmath74 cluster clearly distinguishes as the less bound one",
    ".    the results at the largest values of @xmath13 , i. e. in the weak confinement regime , can be taken as indications of stability or instability of the free clusters .",
    "the triexciton seems to be unbound ( like in three dimensions@xcite ) , and the four - exciton system  evidently unbound .",
    "however , the larger clusters are likely to be stable . the situation may be analogous to nuclei , where there is a small instability island around atomic number five .",
    "the differences @xmath75 are shown in fig .",
    "we notice that these differences enter the expression    @xmath76    for the frequency of light creating a new electron - hole pair in the background of @xmath3 pairs .",
    "@xmath77 is the semiconductor gap , and @xmath78 are the electron ( hole ) confinement energies in the @xmath49-direction .    as following from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the absorption peak corresponding to ( [ frecuencia ] ) will exhibit an interesting behaviour as a function of the number of photoexcited pairs , @xmath3 .",
    "high values of @xmath3 can be reached by rising the laser excitation power .",
    "when @xmath3 is around four , we shall observe a highly blueshifted line , followed by a redshifted one as the power is further increased .",
    "the conclusions coming from our oversimplified model have only a qualitative predictive power .",
    "the effect is so pronounced , however , that we expect it may be observed in experiments .",
    "we also studied non - symmetric or non - neutral systems , in which @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the cases @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath80 .",
    "the results for their ground state energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in a non - neutral system ,",
    "the energy is an increasing function of @xmath13 for low @xmath13 values , as for electrons @xcite , but for weaker confinement the -@xmath82 biexcitonic contribution dominates over the @xmath83 repulsion .",
    "a biexciton plus remaining electrons shall be seen at very large @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath81 , @xmath80 system clearly reveals the change in slope .",
    "in the present paper , we have shown that the bethe - goldstone equations may be used as a powerful method to study small confined excitonic clusters .",
    "pure electronic quantum dots may be studied as well , and external electric and magnetic fields can be easily included in the calculations .",
    "larger unbalanced systems with only one exciton may be studied to obtain the optical absorption and photoluminescence of small electronic quantum dots .",
    "our numerical results suggest a small instability island for the free clusters around @xmath84 .",
    "we showed that this instability causes the appearance of distinct absorption peaks as the laser excitation power is raised .",
