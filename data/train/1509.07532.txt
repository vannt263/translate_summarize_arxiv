    "recently introduced concept of topological characterization of bulk energy structure of crystals brings additional attention to bismuth antimony alloy and lead tin chalcogenides@xcite .",
    "the former material was among the first predicted topological insulators ( tis ) which are classified according to the time reversal symmetry . for definite percentage of antimony",
    "the alloy becomes a ti , although pure bismuth is not a ti .",
    "the latter materials are known as topological crystalline insulators ( tcis ) for certain content of tin@xcite ( or at low temperatures@xcite ) whose surface states are protected by the mirror symmetry .",

    "it leads to an anisotropic 3d dirac equation that describes dynamics of fermions in the * k@xmath6p*-approximation . in this paper",
    "we will use a simplified isotropic version of the equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the 3d momentum , @xmath9 is the bulk energy gap between conduction and valence bands in the @xmath5-valley , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are vectors of the pauli matrices acting in spin and band subspaces correspondingly , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are 2x2 identity matrices , @xmath14 is an effective speed of light , @xmath15 is a four - component envelope function , @xmath16 are spinors describing conduction and valence bands correspondingly .",
    "the appendix [ appendix ] comprises a detailed derivation of * k@xmath6p*-hamiltonian for bismuth antimony and lead tin chalcogenides which has the form of the hamiltonian in the left - hand side of eq .",

    "study of surface states for the 3d dirac equation ( [ dirac_eq ] ) has a rather long history .",
    "first , jackiw and rebbi@xcite revealed that the dirac equation has doubly degenerate bound states with zero energy if the mass term @xmath17 has opposite sign from two sides of an interface region .",
    "later it was shown@xcite that the interface states with 2d weyl dispersion should arise in lead tin chalcogenides junctions where variation of tin content results in inversion of the mass term .",
    "one may use this treatment to phenomenologically consider a ti@xcite or tci@xcite surface .",
    "another approach to surface states ( sss ) of the dirac equation ( [ dirac_eq ] ) is to derive an appropriate boundary condition ( bc ) for the four - component wave function @xmath18 at a surface .",

    "one should consider not only variation of the mass term but an additional electric potential which is responsible for electronic affinity of stacked materials .    for special surface orientation we may additionally require the bc ( [ boundary_condition_main ] ) to be invariant under mirror reflection if there is no surface reconstruction@xcite .",

    "in this section we derive the * k@xmath6p*-hamiltonian for electrons in @xmath5-valley of bismuth antimony which is of the form of the anisotropic dirac hamiltonian .",
    "in addition we calculate spectra of surface states for this hamiltonian .",
    "the small group of the @xmath5-point is @xmath169@xcite .",
    "the cartesian system is chosen as follows : @xmath170 axis is perpendicular to the mirror @xmath171 plane , @xmath40 coincides with @xmath172 direction .",
    "it is well known that in pure bismuth two - band approximation gives adequate picture of band dispersion in @xmath5-valleys@xcite .",
    "these bands are transformed according to @xmath173 and @xmath174 irreducible representations of the @xmath169 point group .",
    "@xmath175 is symmetric and @xmath176 changes the sign under the inversion .",
    "we will use the invariant method@xcite to derive the * k@xmath6p*-hamiltonian from the symmetry consideration . to further proceed",
    "we explicitly write down the matrices of @xmath177 double group representations of the @xmath169 elements : , , , ; , where @xmath178 is an element of @xmath169 .",
    "the invariant method requires that for any element g of the point group the hamiltonian should satisfy the following condition @xmath179 . in the band subspace",
    "the hamiltonian is of the form : @xmath180 the most interesting in eq.([ham_band_subspace ] ) is the non - diagonal terms that represents * k@xmath6p*-interaction between @xmath175 and @xmath176 bands .",
    "the upper right term should satisfy the condition @xmath181 .",
    "direct product of @xmath182 , where @xmath183 transforms as @xmath170 and @xmath184 as @xmath185 or @xmath40 . using representation matrices mentioned above",
    "we obtain that @xmath12 and @xmath186 transform as @xmath185 or @xmath40 , @xmath187 transforms as @xmath170 .",
    "therefore the * k@xmath6p*-interaction term explicitly reads as follows @xmath188 from time - reversal symmetry follows that @xmath189 are real parameters .",
    "hermiticity of the hamiltonian ( [ ham_band_subspace ] ) leads to identity : @xmath190 . in zero order in momentum for diagonal terms of the hamiltonian ( [ ham_band_subspace ] )",
    "we retain only zero order in momentum terms @xmath191 , where @xmath9 plays the role of the band gap .",
    "finally , we get the following form of the two - band * k@xmath6p*-hamiltonian : @xmath192 where @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 .",
    "next step to the dirac hamiltonian is to perform unitary transformation @xmath196 with @xmath197 together with rotation in @xmath198 plane on some angle @xmath199 ( [ alpha - angle ] ) .",
    "after an appropriate choice of @xmath200 and @xmath199 to make @xmath201 and @xmath202 real positive parameters , we arrive to the diagonal in spin and momentum form of @xmath203 ( [ bismuth_ham ] ) : @xmath204 where @xmath205 , , .",
    "primes under @xmath206 mean that they are determined in the rotated cartesian system .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath199 has the following value @xmath207    @xmath208 is determined up to the sign in the second term .",
    "this sign has no impact on the energy dispersion .",
    "however it distinguishes two topologically distinct classes of the hamiltonian ( [ ham_mirror_chirality ] ) and is known as a mirror chirality@xcite .",
    "finally we perform unitary transformation @xmath209 that reduces the hamiltonian ( [ ham_mirror_chirality ] ) to the standard ( but anisotropic ) form of the dirac hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath210 @xmath209 matrices read as follows @xmath211    boundary condition for the four - component wave function @xmath212 that obeys the 3d dirac equation @xmath213 can be obtain from hermiticity of @xmath214 ( [ bismuth_dirac_ham ] ) in the restricted region and time - reversal symmetry@xcite .",
    "it is of the following form ( compare to eq.([boundary_condition_main ] ) ) : @xmath215_{s}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath216 are coordinates of an inner normal to a surface @xmath21 in the rotated cartesian system . for surfaces with @xmath217 we may additionally force the bc ( [ anisotropic_bc ] ) to be invariant under the mirror symmetry @xmath218 , if there is no surface reconstruction . for the basis of the hamiltonian @xmath214",
    "the mirror symmetry operator is expressed by @xmath219 .",
    "invariance of the bc ( [ anisotropic_bc ] ) under the mirror reflection imposes the following restriction on the bc operator @xmath220 : @xmath221 , where @xmath222 @xmath223 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "this results in restriction @xmath224 if @xmath225 . in case of @xmath226",
    "there is no limitation for @xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that the reflection plane is its own for the every @xmath5-valley .",
    "therefore if @xmath224 due to the mirror symmetry for one @xmath5-valley , it is not necessarily the case for the other @xmath5-valleys . the non - reconstructed ( 111 ) surface is the only surface for which the all three inequivalent @xmath5-valleys have mirror planes .",
    "further we study the spectra of surface states for the anisotropic 3d dirac equation @xmath213 with the bc ( [ anisotropic_bc ] ) on plane surface with @xmath227 .",
    "for this surface @xmath228 are good quantum numbers .",
    "after some algebra we arrive to the following energy spectra of surface states : @xmath229 where @xmath230 , @xmath231 .",
    "eq.([anisotropic_energy_ss ] ) is an anisotropic version of surface state dispersion that are displayed in fig.[fig : semispace_specrtum ] . as it was noted above the mirror symmetry forces @xmath0 to zero . in this case",
    "we have flat band surface state spectrum @xmath232 .      in this section",
    "we derive the standard 3d dirac hamiltonian@xcite for @xmath5-valley of lead tin chalcogenides and analyze what constrictions if any the mirror symmetry imposes on the bc ( [ anisotropic_bc ] ) . in the face - centric cubic lattice the small group of @xmath5-point is @xmath233 .",
    "it is considered that the two relevant spin degenerate bands transform according to @xmath234 and @xmath235 representations of double group@xcite .",
    "we will derive the * k@xmath6p*-hamiltonian for @xmath5-valley on the @xmath22 $ ] edge of the brillouin zone . therefore it is convenient to work in a coordinate system with @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25$]@xcite .",
    "the basis functions of @xmath234 can be chosen as @xmath236 and @xmath237 for @xmath235 . following the similar procedure that was described for bismuth antimony in the previous section we obtain the following hamiltonian : @xmath238 where as usual @xmath9 plays the role of the band gap , @xmath239 , @xmath240 are real parameters .",
    "the order of the bands determines only the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "the operator of symmetry reflection in @xmath171 plane for this representation is expressed by the matrix @xmath241 .",
    "finally the unitary transformation @xmath242 reduces the hamiltonian ( [ lead_tin_ham ] ) to the standard dirac one : @xmath243    the bc for the hamiltonian ( [ lead_tin_dirac_ham ] ) is of the form eq.([anisotropic_bc ] ) with @xmath244 .",
    "it should be noted that the mirror operator for the representation of the hamiltonian ( [ lead_tin_dirac_ham ] ) is @xmath245 .",
    "the mirror symmetry does not impose any restrictions on the bc for surfaces that are of the mirror symmetry ( in our case they are determined by @xmath246 with @xmath247 , @xmath248 are arbitrary ) as we have @xmath249 where the bc operator is expressed by @xmath250 in the isotropic case the equation ( [ lead_tin_gamma ] ) transforms to the formula ( [ isotropic_gamma ] ) ."
