    "inflationary models  @xcite can solve some of the outstanding problems in cosmology . also , as emphasized already some time ago  @xcite , for a given model it is possible to calculate the various spectra of fluctuations produced during the inflationary phase and to put the predictions to test using observational data . in the simplest inflationary models ,",
    "the fourier components of the gravitational potential are gaussian stochastic quantities with an approximately flat ( harrison - zeldovich ) r.m.s .",
    "spectrum  @xcite . for more complicated spectra ,",
    "calculation of the spectrum can be implemented either analytically or numerically , ( for the latter possibility , see for ex .",
    "@xcite ) , and the spectrum can be obtained with very high accuracy .",
    "the ( approximately ) flat ( harrison - zeldovich ) spectrum , together with the assumptions of the standard cdm ( cold dark matter ) model was put to test using @xmath7-body simulations and a very good agreement was found with the observed galaxy - galaxy correlation function on scales @xmath8mpc when @xmath9  @xcite , see also  @xcite ( @xmath10 km / s / mpc ) .",
    "observations seem to imply more power on scales greater than @xmath11mpc , strong evidence coming from the apm galaxy survey and observed peculiar velocities  @xcite and from large - angle @xmath12 fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to solve this problem , either abandoning the assumptions of cdm , one may consider a mixture of hot and cold dark matter  @xcite or a nonvanishing cosmological constant , or trying cdm with an initial perturbation spectrum having more power on large scales . following the second possibility ,",
    "an attractive solution is to consider so called  tilted \" spectra , with spectral index @xmath13 .",
    "such a spectrum will occur in power - law and in extended inflation .",
    "recent studies however  @xcite have shown that no value of @xmath14 seems able to reconcile the cdm model with all the observations ( in accordance with the earlier `` pre - cobe '' discussion in  @xcite ) , although the value @xmath15 comes closest to it .",
    "so , if we want to reconcile the cdm model with observations without introducing neutrinos with a restmass of a few @xmath16 , we have to consider models belonging to the next level of complexity , i.e. having at least one more additional parameter characterizing the initial perturbation spectrum .",
    "inflationary models with flat spectra need one free parameter to specify the amplitude of the spectrum of density perturbations , for example the coupling constant of the inflaton in the simplest versions of inflation , while those generating a tilted spectrum need one more free parameter , for example the brans - dicke parameter @xmath17 in extended inflation models .",
    "we will consider here double inflationary models  . in the specific models considered here ,",
    "the inflationary stage is driven by scalar fields without mutual interaction potential .",
    "as a general rule , such models produce a spectrum of adiabatic perturbations having more power on scales larger than some characteristic scale  @xcite .",
    "three free parameters are now needed : one for the height and the form of the  step \" , one for its location and finally one for the overall normalization .",
    "we study here two double inflationary models consisting of two noninteracting scalar fields , a light scalar field @xmath0 with potential @xmath1 and a heavy scalar field @xmath2 with potential @xmath3 .",
    "the spectra obtained numerically are then compared with observational data .",
    "recently , an analogous study was performed for another double - inflationary model  @xcite and we will present the results in a way which makes the comparison easier . in section",
    "i we give some basic results for the models considered here and specify their free parameters . in section ii , we give the various observational tests to which our models are submitted for different values of their parameter . in section iii finally , we give a brief discussion of our results .",
    "let us start with a short description of the homogeneous background .",
    "we consider the following lagrangian density describing matter and gravity @xmath18 where @xmath19 and the landau - lifshitz sign conventions are used .",
    "when @xmath20 , whereas for @xmath21 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the space - time metric has the form @xmath22 spatial curvature may always be neglected because it becomes vanishingly small during the first period of inflation driven by the heavy scalar field .",
    "the homogeneous background is treated classically , it is determined by the scale factor @xmath23 and the two scalar fields @xmath24 .",
    "their equations of motion are given by @xmath25 where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "we have the useful equation @xmath27 which shows that @xmath28 always decreases with time in this model .",
    "let us consider now the inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "we consider a perturbed frw background whose metric , in the longitudinal gauge , reads @xmath29 ( in bardeen s notations  @xcite , @xmath30 ) .",
    "we get from the perturbed einstein equations ( @xmath31 spatial dependence is assumed and the fourier transform convention is @xmath32 ) @xmath33\\delta \\phi_h & = & 4\\dot \\phi_h \\dot \\phi -2\\lambda \\phi_h^{n-1 } \\phi , \\nonumber\\\\ \\delta \\ddot{\\phi_l } + 3h\\delta \\dot \\phi_l + \\bigl ( { { k^2}\\over { a^2}}+m_l^2\\bigr ) \\delta \\phi_l & = & 4\\dot \\phi_l \\dot \\phi -2m_l^2\\phi_l\\phi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that , contrary to the case when only one scalar field is involved , when we have more than one scalar field , the dynamics of the perturbed system can not be described by just one equation for the master quantity @xmath34 @xcite or else for the gauge - invariant quantity @xmath35 in terms of which the action for the fluctuations can be written @xcite .",
    "analogously to  @xcite one can now compute the spectrum of growing adiabatic perturbations .",
    "these perturbations arise from the vacuum fluctuations of the scalar fields @xmath2 and @xmath0 . the fluctuations are gaussian and the power spectrum @xmath36 of the gravitational potential , defined through @xmath37 characterizes them completely . for scales crossing the hubble radius",
    "when both scalar fields are in the slow rolling regime , the spectrum of growing adiabatic perturbations , when those scales are outside the hubble radius during the matter - dominated stage ( assuming @xmath38 at the present time ) , is given by @xmath39 where the r.h.s .",
    "has to be taken at @xmath40 , the time at which a perturbation with wavenumber @xmath41 comes outside the hubble radius during inflation , @xmath42 .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath43 corresponds to the characteristic scale appearing in the spectrum and it is close to the scale crossing the hubble radius near the end of the first inflation .",
    "hence , there exists a very broad interval of scales for which the dynamics of inflation at the time of the first hubble radius crossing is determined by the field @xmath2 while the main contribution to @xmath44 is made by @xmath0 .",
    "we see from ( [ eq : log ] ) that the upper part of the spectrum , corresponding to small @xmath45s or very large scales , is not flat but has a logarithmic dependence @xmath46 .",
    "this gives , as we will see , a crucial difference between the @xmath6 and @xmath5 spectra .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 is the number of e - folds from time @xmath26 till the end of the second inflation and it is given by @xmath48 in order to have a sufficiently long second inflationary stage that will put the characteristic length scale of the spectrum on a scale in agreement with observations , we have that @xmath49 near the end of the first inflation so @xmath50 .",
    "a very little change in this initial value will be enough to shift the spectrum in @xmath41-space while leaving the form of the spectrum practically unaltered .",
    "we define the parameter @xmath51 , @xmath52 gives the order of magnitude of the ratio of the energy of the heavy scalar field to the energy of the light scalar field near the end of the first inflation ; it specifies the form of the spectrum , namely its  step \" with more power on large scales , and the width of the transition region in @xmath41-space .",
    "we will now estimate @xmath53 , the height of the  step \" in the spectrum between a scale which is on the upper plateau ( but of course still inside the cosmological horizon ) and a scale at the beginning of the lower plateau . for scales crossing the hubble radius at the beginning of the second inflationary stage ( neglecting possible small oscillations )",
    ", we have the standard result of inflation driven by one scalar field in slow - rolling regime @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "we therefore get for @xmath53 @xmath56 for @xmath6 , this is @xmath57 whereas @xmath5 yields @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "we will investigate models with @xmath60 for @xmath5 and @xmath61 for @xmath6 .",
    "how we choose the scales of our spectra is very important when we compare them with the observations . for this purpose , we need a precise definition and we adopt here the convention of  @xcite , and define it with the help of @xmath62 , the scale where the extrapolated upper part intersects the lower plateau .",
    "one shows numerically that the evolution of the background also during the transition between the two main inflationary stages is inflationary , in the sense that @xmath63 , for @xmath64 when @xmath6  @xcite and for @xmath65 when @xmath5 .",
    "also , the initial perturbation spectrum will have no oscillations for @xmath66 when @xmath6 and also for all @xmath67 s considered here when @xmath5 .",
    "a last comment concerns the power spectrum @xmath68 defined through @xmath69 .",
    "linear perturbations grow at different rates depending on the relation between their wavelengths , the jeans length and the hubble radius and this is specified by the transfer function @xmath70 [ more accurately , one should write @xmath71 @xmath72 where by definition , @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath70 is computed numerically making assumptions about the matter content of the universe , and depends on parameters like @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we use here the transfer function for the standard cdm model given by  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "we will assume tacitly in all the formulas that the density parameter @xmath78 , in accordance with inflation .",
    "the power spectra @xmath68 for different values of the parameters are displayed for the @xmath6 , resp .",
    "@xmath5 model in fig.1 , resp .",
    "let us start with the normalization of the spectrum . since the discovery of large angular scale fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation by cobe dmr  @xcite , one can normalize the spectrum of fluctuations using these cobe dmr observations .",
    "these observations probe the spectrum of fluctuations on very large scales , from several hundreds mpc up to the cosmological horizon and allow for a normalization based on first principles .",
    "more precisely , one has @xmath80\\equiv",
    "\\sum_{l\\geq 2}a_l^2 \\exp [ -l(l+1)\\theta_0 ^ 2],\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the gaussian angle corresponding to the antenna beam and additional smearing of the raw data .",
    "it is to be noted that due to the exponential factor , only the multipoles up to @xmath82 contribute significantly to the observed anisotropy .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "coefficients @xmath83 , with @xmath84 defined by @xmath85 are actually independent of @xmath86 . based on the latest results of cobe dmr  @xcite , we take @xmath87 , with error bars at the 1@xmath88level .",
    "this allows us to normalize the fluctuation spectrum and constitutes a great step forward . for the cmbr anisotropy , on large angular scales",
    "the dominant effect is the sachs - wolfe effect and , for adiabatic perturbations , we have the fundamental relation @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a spherical bessel function and @xmath91 is the comoving distance between us and the surface of recombination , we have in very good approximation @xmath92 . in the models we are considering here ,",
    "normalization of the power spectrum @xmath68 , which is obtained for _ given @xmath67 and location of the  step \" _ , through eq .",
    "( [ sw ] ) will fix the value of the remaining free parameter @xmath93 or equivalently @xmath94 .",
    "the parameter @xmath94 will have the order of magnitude given thereafter when we vary @xmath67 and @xmath62 earlier  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the energy density at the beginning of the second inflation is also fixed : it is @xmath95 for @xmath6 . for the parameter @xmath93 , we get the following result , when we vary the parameters : @xmath96 and the corresponding energy density is then @xmath97 for @xmath5 .",
    "another remark concerns the contribution to the cmbr anisotropy on large scales ( @xmath98 ) which comes from gravitational waves ( tensor metric perturbations ) .",
    "one can show that this contribution is equal for both models and rather small , namely @xmath99 where the subscript @xmath100 refers to that part of the fluctuations due to adiabatic perturbations , i.e. , the quantity calculated in  ( [ sw ] ) . although this effect is not large , it is important here for the @xmath6 model , which for some choices of the parameters will turn out to be in marginal agreement with observations .",
    "also , one has to take into account  cosmic variance \" which is connected to the fact that we try to estimate r.m.s .",
    "values of physical quantities in the universe from a limited sample .",
    "therefore , independently on how good the cobe measurements may be , the quantities @xmath101 obey a @xmath102-distribution for @xmath103 d.o.f .    in connection with recent interest in relations between @xmath104 ( for @xmath105 ) and the slopes of power spectra of adiabatic perturbations , @xmath106 , and of gravitational waves ,",
    "@xmath107 , it is interesting to note that the relation @xmath108 ( proposed , e.g. , in  @xcite ) is valid in our models for @xmath109 ( and not too small ) though it is not valid for @xmath110 and also not valid for single chaotic inflation . on the other hand ,",
    "the relation @xmath111 which is valid for single slow - rolling inflation ( see e.g.  @xcite for chaotic inflation ) is strongly violated if @xmath112 ( this issue will be addressed in a separate publication  @xcite ) .",
    "a lot of information can be gained from the observation of peculiar velocities , velocities in addition to the hubble flow . as all matter contributes gravitationally , the peculiar velocities sample all the mass and not just the galaxies .",
    "hence , knowing the peculiar velocity field would give us an information on the primordial spectrum of the same interest as the cmbr anisotropy .",
    "it should however be stressed that large - scale peculiar velocities have rather large uncertainties . in the linear regime ,",
    "gravitational instability produces a velocity field that is irrotational at sufficiently late times , the velocity field @xmath113 then derives from a velocity potential @xmath114 with @xmath115",
    ". measurements of redshifts @xmath116 and of galaxy distances @xmath117 ( actually of @xmath118 ) provide the radial component of the peculiar velocity field:@xmath119 , for a galaxy at small redshift . for a potential flow , the radial velocity field when integrated along radial paths gives the velocity potential out of which the other velocity components can be derived .",
    "the difficulty with this method is to construct a smooth radial velocity field and to eliminate the statistical uncertainties in @xmath120 .",
    "this is done with interpolation and smoothing of the raw data and we finally have the following equation @xmath121 where @xmath122 stands for the fourier transform , up to a constant , of the  top hat \" window function @xmath123 we will compare our predictions with the potent data . in these observations",
    "the raw data are smoothed with a gaussian smoothing radius @xmath124mpc while spheres of radii @xmath125mpc and @xmath126mpc were considered .",
    "the data are @xmath127 km / s and @xmath128 km / s  @xcite , error bars at the 1@xmath88 level .",
    "analogously to what was found in  @xcite , this test is crucial for our models too .",
    "velocities are generally too low and all the models are excluded if one does nt invoke cosmic variance for the measured peculiar velocities . for the @xmath6 models ,",
    "the best velocities are systematically obtained for @xmath129mpc .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath5 , except when @xmath130 , but the velocities do not grow significantly for smaller @xmath62 .",
    "also , it turns out that the @xmath5 model can be excluded : for @xmath131 one gets the best velocities , but other tests exclude these models while for @xmath132 , the velocities become too small .      before the cobe dmr observations of the cmbr anisotropy , one way to normalize the fluctuation spectrum was through the quantity @xmath133",
    "this quantity measures the variance of the total mass fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath134mpc .",
    "the reason for considering spheres of radii @xmath134mpc is that for bright galaxies @xmath135 is equal to one @xcite .",
    "however , one does nt expect the total matter to be as clustered as bright galaxies and one tries therefore the simplest assumption , namely that there is a scale independent bias , given by the biasing factor @xmath136 @xmath137 where the subscript @xmath138 refers to galaxies while @xmath139 is the two - point correlation function .",
    "@xmath140 can be computed from the power spectrum @xmath68 @xmath141 early numerical simulations of cdm models  @xcite were able to reproduce the correct two - point correlation function @xmath139 which is certainly a great success for cdm .",
    "it required however , if one imposes @xmath78 , that @xmath75 is as low as @xmath142 .",
    "however for @xmath143 one gets the right amplitude for @xmath139 assuming that @xmath144 .",
    "another reason for considering a bias comes from the observed r.m.s .",
    "peculiar velocities between galaxy pairs . if @xmath78 and there is no bias then numerical simulations give velocities @xmath145km / s , as expected also on theoretical grounds , much larger than the observed ones @xmath146km / s ( see however  @xcite for a possible velocity bias ) . here",
    "also , an @xmath147 model will be compatible with the observed peculiar velocity fields if we introduce a biasing parameter @xmath148 .",
    "finally , @xmath149 is needed in order to get the correct amount of clusters of galaxies  @xcite .    for @xmath5",
    ", we get an unacceptably low @xmath136 ( @xmath150 ) for @xmath131 , for @xmath151 . for @xmath6",
    ", we get too low @xmath136 for @xmath152 which are just the values that produce the best velocities .",
    "the very existence of compact objects observed at high redshifts constrains any proposed model for the formation of galaxies as these objects must already have formed at these high @xmath116 .",
    "quasars have now been observed up to redshifts near @xmath153 .",
    "they are believed to be powered by massive black holes located at the center of galaxies .",
    "from luminosity bounds one can estimate the mass of the black holes ( @xmath154 ) , while for the host galaxy the estimates give @xmath155 .",
    "although the formation of gravitationally bound objects is a complicated non - linear process one can , using rather simple assumptions , make a connection with the linear theory @xcite .",
    "the fraction @xmath156 of bound objects with mass greater than some given mass @xmath157 can be expressed as a function of @xmath158  @xcite , where @xmath159 is the radius of the sphere containing an amount of mass @xmath157 today , and @xmath158 is calculated assuming a linear evolution ( in this subsection we will adopt the notation @xmath160 : @xmath161 where erfc is the complementary error function , @xmath162 .",
    "the spherical collapse model gives for the collapse threshold value @xmath163 , the value used here , though estimates from numerical simulations suggest other acceptable values ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "the most recent estimates of the mass fraction @xmath165 in host galaxies of quasars at @xmath166  @xcite yields the following lower bound  @xcite , using  ( [ eq : press ] )  : @xmath167 when comparing our predictions with the data , we should keep in mind that equation  ( [ quasar ] ) is only a lower bound as quasars do not necessarily form in all potential host galaxies and the real number of quasars at @xmath166 might be larger than the observed one . also important",
    "is the fact that many large galaxies seem to have formed already at @xmath168 . from this observation",
    "we get the lower bound @xmath169 approximately the same estimate follows from ref .",
    "@xcite    for @xmath170 , considering the best velocities obtained for @xmath171mpc , the values obtained for this test are too low . for these models , it is interesting to point out that if the overall normalization goes up , hence improving these numbers , the biasing factor of these models will become too low so that these models must be rejected",
    ".      we finally compare our models with the counts - in - cells analysis of large- scale clustering of the stromlo - apm redshift survey  @xcite .",
    "values for the counts - in - cells variance @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the cell size expressed in @xmath174mpc , obtained with our spectra normalized according to @xmath175 , corresponding to optical galaxies in redshift space , are compared with the stromlo - apm data . in order to decide whether our model fits the data well",
    ", we apply a @xmath102 analysis . considering the 9 data points ( for 9 different cell sizes ) as independent and the error bars quoted in @xcite as @xmath176 ones ,",
    "while we test here a theory with 2 parameters @xmath67 and @xmath62 ( we still have the possibility to change the normalization , this is just changing @xmath136 ) , we have a @xmath102 distribution with 7 d.o.f .",
    "the variance @xmath172 can be written as @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the analogous of @xmath179 , but now for a cell of size @xmath173 @xmath180 a @xmath181 will be considered good while @xmath182 will be considered bad .",
    "the @xmath5 model gives very bad numbers , @xmath183 for @xmath184 for @xmath185 , for @xmath186 the test is still not too good , @xmath187 .",
    "all the models with @xmath188 will yield very good results , @xmath189 for @xmath190mpc .",
    "the obtained large scale peculiar velocities are low for all values of @xmath67 and @xmath62 .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to assume that , due to  cosmic variance \" , the velocities observed around us are higher than the real average . if we assume that the peculiar velocities are measured from just one independent volume , @xmath191 ( actually @xmath192 or @xmath193 ) itself obeys a @xmath102-distribution ( with one d.o.f . and variance @xmath194 ) , for example there is a 20% probability to have @xmath195 and a 30% probability to have @xmath196 .",
    "but one has to be cautious , when invoking cosmic variance since a @xmath102-distibution with one d.o.f . for @xmath191 might be too crude .    when @xmath5 , we get the highest , though still rather low , velocities for the lowest values of @xmath67 .",
    "but for @xmath131 , we get unacceptably low @xmath136 and unacceptably high values for @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "comparison with the counts - in - cells analysis gives very bad results for @xmath152 .",
    "for @xmath199 we get acceptable @xmath197 and @xmath198 , however the velocities become unacceptably low and this situation becomes only worse with growing @xmath67 .",
    "for example @xmath200 gives unacceptably high @xmath136 and unacceptably low @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "hence , the @xmath5 model is very unlikely and can be confidently excluded .",
    "an improved situation is obtained when @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain a window of allowed parameters for @xmath203mpc and @xmath204 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "however , also for this window , the velocities are too low compared to the potent data and one has to invoke  cosmic variance \" and higher observed velocities around us than the real average one . in order to avoid that the magnitude of this effect is too unprobably high , we can also push the cobe data to their upper @xmath205 error bar , an increase of about ( 20 - 25)% resulting in the same increase in the power spectrum @xmath68 and a corresponding decrease of the biasing factor @xmath136 ( @xmath102 is unaffected )",
    ". we would still get acceptable numbers , though @xmath136 would become rather low ( @xmath206 ) , in particular @xmath201 which are otherwise a little bit low get better .",
    "note however , that even for the mean cobe normalization , the values of the large - scale bulk velocities in the @xmath6 model for the allowed range of parameters are slightly higher than those in the cdm model with a cosmological constant and flat initial perturbation spectrum ( see e.g.  @xcite ) which are in turn higher than those in the tilted cdm model with @xmath207 .",
    "thus , this problem is less severe for the double inflationary @xmath6 model than for the latter models .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have considered here two double - inflationary models with two noninteracting scalar fields : a light scalar field @xmath0 with potential @xmath1 and a heavy scalar field @xmath2 with potential @xmath3 .",
    "we have analized numerically the cases @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "trying cdm with an initial spectrum produced by these models , one has three free parameters , that is two more than the standard cdm model with a ( approximately ) scale - invariant initial spectrum . for given @xmath62 ( location of the  step \" ) and given @xmath208 , normalization to cobe dmr constrain the remaining free parameter of the model",

    "the @xmath5 model is shown to be excluded while the @xmath6 model is marginally admissible for the range of parameters @xmath203mpc and @xmath204 .",
    "in the latter case , the remaining difficulty is still with low large - scale bulk velocities though it is less severe than in the cdm+@xmath215 model or the tilted cdm model .    if one assumes , invoking cosmic variance , that the average values of the measured peculiar velocities are higher than their actual r.m.s .",
    "values , and taking the upper @xmath205 limit of the cobe dmr data for the overall normalization , a window of parameters mentioned above for the @xmath6 model remains compatible with observations , however with velocities about 30% less than the lower 1@xmath88 measured ones . if the cobe dmr measurements go a little bit up as they did recently , while the measured peculiar velocities on which there are still rather large uncertainties godown , then these models will do better . another potential difficulty which might also be cured by an overall increase of amplitude is the rather small total density fluctuations at galaxy scales .",
