    "during the past few decades , elaborate solar neutrino  @xcite and atmospheric neutrino  @xcite experiments have provided a wealth of convincing evidences for the existence of massive neutrinos and neutrino mixing , which could have an essential impact on particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "attentions have been focused on solving the puzzles of unexpected discrepancies between calculated and observed neutrino fluxes . instead of the more difficult and unlikely solution from an improved solar model  @xcite , the solar @xmath3 deficit could be reconciled with the prediction if neutrino oscillations occur either in vacuum or in the presence of solar matter .",
    "the flavor oscillation can be parameterized by the mass - squared differences of the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the mixing angles between weak eigenstates and mass eigenstates of the neutrinos ( @xmath6 is assumed ) . in terms of these parameters , the just - so vacuum oscillation  @xcite requires @xmath7 ev@xmath8 and @xmath9 , while the msw resonant effect  @xcite in the sun becomes important if @xmath10 ev@xmath8 @xmath11 ev@xmath8 , @xmath12 ( large angle solution ) , or",
    "@xmath13 ev@xmath8 @xmath14 ev@xmath8 , @xmath15 ( small angle solution )  @xcite .",
    "recent atmospheric neutrino data from the super - kamiokande  @xcite further provide a strong evidence in support of neutrino oscillation as the cause to deficit of muon neutrinos , provided @xmath16 ev@xmath8 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is clear that this solution to the neutrino anomaly in the atmosphere represents quite a distinct area in the parameter space as compared to that of the solar neutrino deficit .",
    "based on the conclusive lep experiment at cern  @xcite that there are three flavors of light , active neutrinos participating in the weak interaction , a direct - mass hierarchy @xmath0 , with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) naturally accommodates the scales of both the two mass - squared differences and provides solutions to both puzzles : the conversion @xmath21 causes the observed deficit in the solar @xmath3 flux and the vacuum oscillation @xmath22 suppresses the @xmath23 flux in the atmosphere .",
    "in addition to the sun and the atmosphere , type - ii supernovae are also natural sources that emit neutrinos . despite the first - ever observation of sn neutrino signals from sn 1987a  @xcite , detailed neutrino spectral shapes",
    "have not yet been determined with certainty due to low statistics and the physical processes that are not well understood .",
    "this difficulty is accompanied by , for instance , the uncertainties in the characteristic temperatures @xmath24 as neutrinos were emitted from the neutrino - spheres .",
    "consequently , the interpretation of future measurements of sn neutrinos would contain ambiguity in that the observed spectrum , which may have been deformed through conversion processes , could be simulated by different set of parameters at different temperatures .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to investigate how the uncertainty in @xmath24 could impact the interpretation of events at terrestrial detectors . in this paper , the parameters that solve solar and atmospheric neutrino problems",
    "are taken as inputs , a natural choice as also adopted by some earlier works  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "in addition , with the uncertainty in @xmath24 considered , we study whether a particular set of parameters could be singled out by future observations of sn neutrinos .",
    "unlike solar neutrinos , the initial neutrino flux from a supernova contains all flavors of neutrino : @xmath25 and their anti - particles . under the direct - mass hierarchy of neutrinos",
    ", the original @xmath2 spectra will be modified by the msw effect as neutrinos propagate through the resonance .",
    "the @xmath26 spectra , on the contrary , is subject only to vacuum oscillation which yields an large averaged survival probability of @xmath27 .",
    "the high - energy @xmath28 would not be converted to the easily detectable @xmath29 ( for instance , at super - kamiokande ) through the msw effect unless neutrino masses are inverted , in which case the heavier mass eigenstate has a larger component in @xmath3 than in @xmath23 or @xmath30 . since the mixing angles are defined in the first octant , the weak eigenstates @xmath31 , and @xmath3 are predominant in the mass eigenstates @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "under the direct - mass hierarchy where @xmath34 , the mass eigenstates follow the hierarchy @xmath35 , while in the inverted - mass hierarchy , for instance , @xmath36 , the pattern @xmath37 follows . some models and phenomenological consequences involving inverted neutrino masses",
    "have been discussed  @xcite .",
    "although current msw solutions to the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) have excluded @xmath3 as the heavier eigenstate , the inverse hierarchy could remain viable if the just - so vacuum oscillation is the solution for the snp .",
    "if the inverted masses do apply and the resonance conditions for the anti - neutrinos are met , this could lead to an effective conversion between @xmath29 and the higher - energy @xmath38 to yield copious @xmath29-type events in the earth - bound detector . with the uncertainty in @xmath24 considered",
    ", it is our second goal to investigate influences of both the direct and inverted mass hierarchies to future observations of sn neutrinos and how future measurements can play a role in this unsettled issue of direct versus inverted neutrino masses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we summarize the general features of stellar collapse and properties of the emitted neutrinos , and show how the uncertainty in neutrino temperature could affect the outcomes in the detector .",
    "section iii and section iv contain more general results expected from the future observations at both super - kamiokande and sno , for direct and inverted masses , respectively .",
    "based on the measurements , possible schemes which could provide discrimination among input parameters and between the two mass hierarchies are proposed .",
    "section v contains discussions and our concluding remarks .",
    "a massive star ( @xmath39 ) becomes unstable at the last stage of its evolution .",
    "when the mass of the iron core reaches the chandrasekhar limits ( @xmath40 ) , it begins to collapse into a compact object of extremely high density , and the gravitational binding energy is released in the form of neutrinos .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the total emitted energy , the averaged neutrino luminosity , and the mean neutrino energy are independent of the explosive mechanism but depend only on the mass of the initial iron core . regardless of the details of collapsed and bounce , it is well established that to form a typical neutron star after the collapse , an amount of @xmath41 erg , about 99% of the binding energy would be released in the form of neutrinos . each ( anti)neutrino species will carry away about the same amount of energy .",
    "neutrinos are emitted from a collapsed star through two different processes : neutronization burst during the pre - bounce phase and thermal emission in the post - bounce phase .",
    "the neutronization burst of a @xmath3 flux is produced by the electron capture on protons : @xmath42 .",
    "the thermal emission creates @xmath43 pairs of all three flavors via the annihilation of @xmath44 pairs : @xmath45 .",
    "the duration of neutronization burst lasts about a few millisecond and takes away 1%-10% of the total binding energy .",
    "the thermal emission phase has a much wider spread of time structure , in the order of 10 seconds .",
    "the initial neutrino spectrum is usually approximated by a fermi - dirac or a boltzmann distribution with a constant temperature and zero chemical potential .",
    "to reduce the high - energy tail of the fermi - dirac distribution , some elaborate models introduce a nonzero chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the event numbers in a detector depend crucially on the @xmath2 temperature .",
    "however , the numerical calculations based upon various models and physical arguments give rise to relatively wide ranges of temperature for each neutrino species  @xcite and this uncertainty in @xmath24 could complicate the signatures concerning the oscillation of neutrinos from a supernova .",
    "one may refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of neutrino oscillations .",
    "although all the three flavors are emitted from a supernova , the phenomenon of sn neutrino oscillation can be well described through @xmath46 and @xmath47  @xcite . under the direct - mass hierarchy",
    ", the probability @xmath48 is nearly independent of energy and is approximated by the vacuum oscillation expression .",
    "the probability @xmath49 is energy - dependent and contains four parameters under a proper parameterization of the mixing matrix in the full 3-@xmath2 formalism : @xmath50 . in what follows , these four parameters",
    "will simply be denoted as @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively .    among the above four parameters , the angle @xmath52 is special in certain aspect .",
    "in addition to the limit @xmath53 at 90% c.l . set by the chooz  @xcite long baseline reactor in the disappearance mode @xmath54 , an analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite also has given allowed ranges of @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "note that to zeroth order of @xmath58 , the probability becomes  @xcite @xmath59 one may examine @xmath52 in more details through the iso - probability contours for sn neutrinos at several distinct scales of @xmath60 , as shown in figure 1 . within the interested range of @xmath61 , ( @xmath62 , or @xmath63 ) , the @xmath49 contours are almost independent of @xmath52 for @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . the parameter @xmath52 begins to show slight influence on @xmath49 contours only at very small @xmath61 and very large @xmath52 .",
    "hence , for our purpose the choice of @xmath52 within @xmath57 would only affect the results slightly .",
    "the value @xmath66 will be adopted for definiteness . as for other input parameters ,",
    "the following are taken :    large angle msw solution(la ) : @xmath67 ev@xmath68    small angle msw solution(sa ) : @xmath69 ev@xmath70    just - so vacuum solution(js ) : @xmath71 ev@xmath72 .",
    "in what follows , an initial flux described by a fermi - dirac spectrum with zero chemical potential will be assumed .",
    "the detailed time evolution during the cooling phase has been ignored , while the averaged magnitudes and effective temperatures of @xmath73 flux are used instead  @xcite .",
    "the event numbers at the detectors for the neutrino of type @xmath74 are estimated by @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the number of targets in the detector , @xmath77 is the initial number of @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the distance between the supernova and the earth , @xmath80(e@xmath81 ) is the cross section for the corresponding reaction , @xmath82 is the surviving probability for @xmath78 , @xmath83 is the temperature for @xmath78 , and @xmath84}.\\ ] ] in evaluating the surviving probability , the electron number per nucleon is assumed to remain a constant ( @xmath85 ) and the density profile outside the neutrino - sphere ( @xmath86 cm ) is described by the power - law @xmath87 .    to grasp the picture on how uncertainties in neutrino temperatures could affect the interpretation of observed events , we may tentatively assume @xmath88=3 mev , @xmath89= 6 mev ( @xmath90 ) , and compare outcomes from @xmath91=3 mev and @xmath91=4.5 mev . at super - kamiokande  @xcite , contributions from the inverse beta decay @xmath92 predominate due to the high cross section .",
    "events from other interactions : @xmath93  @xcite and @xmath94  @xcite , will also be included in our calculations although these events accumulate up to less than 5% of the @xmath95 events .",
    "the threshold energy is taken to be 5 mev and the detector efficiency is assumed to be 100% . for 32 kton of water , one expects roughly @xmath96 neutrino events for a type ii supernova at the center of our galaxy ( @xmath97 10 kpc away ) .",
    "since the cross section for @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath99 , and @xmath100 for the fermi - dirac distribution , a larger temperature gap between @xmath29 and @xmath101 would cause a more severely distorted spectra from the original one .",
    "hence the difference between @xmath91 and @xmath102 determines to what extend the events are enhanced by oscillation .    for the direct masses where @xmath0 , possible results of the ratio @xmath103 ( @xmath104 indicates oscillation , and @xmath105 indicates the case of no oscillation ) using specific input parameters",
    "la , sa , and js are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the curves representing la and sa are due to msw effects of the @xmath2-type events and the vacuum oscillation of the @xmath26-type events , while the js curve is due to vacuum oscillations of both @xmath2- and @xmath26-type events .",
    "one observes that js parameters could raise event numbers most effectively , an increase of @xmath97 55% is possible at @xmath1063 mev ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the enhancement decreases as @xmath91 approaches @xmath102 . near a particular point",
    "where @xmath108 , the conversion of @xmath29 to @xmath101 would not alter the original @xmath29 spectrum , all the scenarios yield @xmath109 and are indistinguishable among each other .",
    "the complication arises from the fact that if , for instance , @xmath110 is observed , this observation is then either due to la parameters at @xmath111 ev or the js parameters at @xmath112 ev .",
    "the uncertainties in neutrino temperatures would therefore render a wide range of predictions at the detectors .",
    "informations such as the clues for oscillation and neutrino parameters would be hard to understand or even lost due to this complication .",
    "for the observation of sn neutrinos , the extremely distinct time structures between the neutronization burst and the beginning of thermal emission would allow a clear separation at the @xmath113 cherenkov detector .",
    "these two groups of events are discussed separately .    the spectral shape and the total energy of @xmath3 from the early pre - bounce burst is still poorly known . for the purpose of qualitative discussion , the spectrum is arbitrarily chosen to be the same as that of thermal @xmath3 ( fermi - dirac ) with the same mean energy and a total of 5% the binding energy of a typical neutron star ( @xmath114 ) . during this early phase ,",
    "one expects to observe the forward directional events due to elastic scattering @xmath115 and the backward events from @xmath116 .",
    "these neutronization events are summarized in table i. we note that the forward events are relatively insensitive to the uncertainty in @xmath3 temperature .",
    "the oscillation signature manifests itself through the drastically reduced forward events as compared to the original one , although practically the separation among la , sa , and js using events observed during this early phase is difficult .    the backward events on the other hand , are more sensitive to @xmath117 .",
    "the difficulty associated with the backward events comes from the extremely small numbers .",
    "if @xmath118 mev and the total neutrino energy at this stage is down to @xmath119 of @xmath114 , the backward events are practically unobservable . because of the rapidly increased cross section for @xmath116 at higher energy : @xmath120 ,",
    "the situation could be improved if @xmath117 is higher or if the neutrinos emitted during this phase have larger energy partition , which is quite model - dependent .",
    "unlike the backward events , the forward event numbers are roughly in the order of 10 even if @xmath121 3 mev and the @xmath3 flux takes away as low as @xmath119 of @xmath114 .    by using the numerous @xmath122 emitted from the inverse beta decay",
    ", the distorted @xmath29 spectrum would be determined with better statistics . to account for the uncertainties in @xmath117 and @xmath123 , we may let @xmath124 @xmath91 , @xmath125 @xmath91 and compare the outcomes for @xmath91= 4 mev , 5 mev , and 6 mev .",
    "the parameters @xmath126 and @xmath127 are allowed to vary within @xmath128 and @xmath129 to roughly include the temperature ranges given by current models .",
    "expected ranges for the ratios @xmath130 are summarized in table ii , where @xmath131 includes events from the inverse beta decay and the neutrino interactions with oxygen , @xmath132 represents the forward scattering events . for @xmath133 mev",
    ", there are two overlapped areas in @xmath134 : between no , sa and between js , la .",
    "the same overlapping structure remains for @xmath135 mev and @xmath136 mev . despite the wealthy information conveyed through the @xmath122 spectrum at super - kamiokande , from table",
    "ii it seems unlikely that a clear separation among input parameters could be achieved using the otherwise model - independent quantity @xmath134 unless the uncertainties in neutrino temperatures are reduced significantly .",
    "the neutral current@xmath137 breakup reactions of deuterium in sno  @xcite are flavor - blind for neutrinos : @xmath138 @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "the charged current reactions include two parts , @xmath141 @xmath142    with 1 kton of @xmath143 and a threshold energy @xmath97 5 mev ( 100% detection efficiency assumed ) , both @xmath144 and @xmath145 should roughly yield event numbers in the order of @xmath146 . the ratios @xmath147 at sno seem to provide a solution as to how a particular set of parameter could be singled out , as will be shown below .    one may arbitrarily fix @xmath117 and parameterize other temperatures in a similar way :",
    "let @xmath148 and allow an uncertainty in @xmath91 as well : @xmath149 , with @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the ratio @xmath152 for @xmath153 and 5 mev are listed in table iii .",
    "we found that even if the uncertainties in @xmath123 and @xmath91 may complicate the interpretation of observed events , each of the candidates gives rise to a distinct region in @xmath154 . in practical ,",
    "if uncertainties in @xmath155 and @xmath156 can be reduced in the future , it would enable a smaller spread in each @xmath157 for a better separation .",
    "in the light of msw effect , distinctions between direct and inverted masses would most likely appear in the observed neutrino spectra .",
    "if the just - so vacuum oscillation is favored over the msw oscillations as solution to the snp , both direct ( @xmath0 ) and inverted - mass schemes ( @xmath1 ) are allowed since @xmath3 flux can also be converted to @xmath158 through the vacuum oscillation if neutrino masses are inverted .",
    "the @xmath29 flux on the contrary , would go through the msw resonance if the mass hierarchy is inverted .",
    "this conversion would presumably enlarge the @xmath29-type event rates effectively at super - kamiokande . without conflicting current solar and atmospheric neutrino data ,",
    "we would focus on the js parameters : @xmath159ev@xmath8 and large @xmath61 , for a further investigation under the inverted mass scheme @xmath1 .",
    "the possible sn @xmath29 spectra are shown in figure 3 .",
    "curve @xmath160 is the original @xmath29 spectrum and curve @xmath161 represents the distorted one through the just - so vacuum oscillation under the direct - mass scheme while curve @xmath162 is obtained from the msw conversion under the inverted - mass scheme .",
    "curves @xmath161 and @xmath162 nearly overlap , implying that the matter effect is not as prominent as expected , and that the msw effect under the inverted - mass hierarchy is almost identical to the vacuum oscillation under the direct - mass hierarchy for @xmath29 at this particular region of parameter space .",
    "furthermore , the extremely small observable difference at the detectors would make the identification between the two mass patterns very difficult .",
    "the reason becomes clear if the required conditions for a msw resonance and an adiabatic transition to occur are both considered  @xcite : a density profile @xmath87 would yield @xmath163 ev@xmath8 relevant to the msw oscillation in the supernova .",
    "this mass scale is much larger than the mass scale of js parameters ( @xmath164 ev@xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore a very effective conversion of @xmath29 to @xmath101 in a supernova is unlikely for either direct or inverted masses if the js parameters are applied .",
    "the strong conversion of @xmath29 to @xmath101 is actually disfavored by some analyses based on the sn 1987a data  @xcite .",
    "if either la or sa msw conversion is favored over the just - so vacuum oscillation , the case for the inverted hierarchy @xmath1 would then become shaky or can even be ruled out .",
    "an alternative approach might shed some clues to the inverted - mass scheme and its outcomes",
    ". we may characterize consequences for the oscillation @xmath165 by the surviving probability of @xmath29 in three limit cases : @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "the case @xmath168 1 indicates that no conversion occurs among @xmath29 and @xmath101 , which is equivalent to the outcome of having massless neutrinos , and the mass pattern would then unlikely be the main issue .",
    "the js parameters , as already discussed , yield @xmath169 for the msw conversion ( or equivalently , the vacuum oscillation under the direct - mass scheme ) .",
    "one is therefore motivated to further study the consequences for a complete conversion of @xmath29 flux to @xmath101 , where @xmath170 . as pointed out by totani _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , due to statistical uncertainties in experiments and the inconsistency among current analyses , one can not completely exclude the possibility of full conversion .",
    "we may tentatively neglect details of the physical conditions and parameters that required for a complete conversion to occur , and assume that the probability @xmath48 remains approximately a constant within interested range of the neutrino energy .",
    "to reasonably account for the contributions from @xmath3 and @xmath158 fluxes to the total events when a complete conversion occurs in the anti - neutrinos sector , one may first consider the contours of @xmath103 for events from the inverse beta decay only . under the inverted - mass scheme , a wide range of @xmath171 and @xmath61",
    "are shown in figure 4 .",
    "given @xmath172 4.5 mev , @xmath117=3 mev and @xmath173=6 mev , the js parameters ( @xmath164 ev@xmath8 and large @xmath61 ) roughly result in a 20% increment to the event number .",
    "after a full conversion of the anti - neutrinos in which @xmath170 , one would expect to observe a sizable increase in the ratio @xmath103 .",
    "therefore a larger @xmath174 and a smaller @xmath175 , at least several orders of magnitude , are required for a full conversion to occur .",
    "the smallness of @xmath61 , alone with the small @xmath52 , fix the surviving probability of @xmath3 very close to unity .",
    "hence , a full conversion of @xmath29 to @xmath101 would be accompanied by nearly unchanged @xmath3 and @xmath158 fluxes : @xmath176 .",
    "the expected ratios @xmath177 at the super - kamiokande are listed in table iv . despite the better statistic provided by the @xmath29-type events at super - kamiokande ,",
    "the detection is however not unique to the @xmath29 flux , the uncertainties in @xmath88 and @xmath178 therefore make the separation between @xmath170 ( complete conversion ) and @xmath179 difficult .    at the sno detector ,",
    "the charged - current channel @xmath180 is unique to @xmath29 .",
    "this channel can be distinguished from the neutral - current events and the other charged - current channel induced by @xmath3 .",
    "therefore the measurement of @xmath181 events at sno should be sensitive to the full conversion of @xmath29 to @xmath101 .",
    "ratios of the neutral - current events to the charged - current events @xmath181 , denoted as @xmath182 , are shown in table v. we also present values of the same ratio under the direct - mass scheme in table vi as a comparison .",
    "we observe that for a particular @xmath117 , both direct and inverted schemes yield a nearly identical range of @xmath182 if the js parameters are applied , this verifies a previous argument .",
    "the valuable message from this ratio is that for a particular @xmath117 , a complete conversion of the @xmath29 flux through msw resonance represents a unique range of @xmath182 as compared to other scenarios , including that of the direct masses .",
    "typical @xmath182 contours for inverted masses are shown in figure 5 , where @xmath117= 3 mev , @xmath91= 4.5 mev , and @xmath183= 6 mev are assumed . since the neutral - current reaction is blind to the oscillation , a complete swap of @xmath29 and @xmath101 fluxes would definitely yield smaller @xmath182 .",
    "calculations show that @xmath184 for a complete conversion and indicate that @xmath185 ev@xmath8 and @xmath186 are required for a near complete conversion to occur .",
    "tables v and vi suggest that for the detection of sn neutrinos , the direct and inverted masses could be distinguishable if a nearly complete conversion of @xmath29 to @xmath101 occurs , which yields a low @xmath182 and signals the existence of inverted - mass pattern .",
    "since the msw effects become important for supernova neutrinos at @xmath187 ev@xmath8 , a future supernova would provide a test ground for @xmath188 ev@xmath8 .",
    "if the nearly full conversion @xmath189 is observed in the sn neutrino flux , the consequences may have certain implications in that the required parameter spaces for a full conversion are obviously disfavored by current solar neutrino data , while the future solar and atmospheric observations may not severely change the mass scales required to explain the solar and the atmospheric neutrino deficits .",
    "under the constraints of mass scale from solar and atmospheric neutrinos , the @xmath190 scenario naturally leads to four possible hierarchies ( one direct and three inverted ) : @xmath191 case 1 is the normal , direct mass scheme . for case 2 , @xmath174 in the mass scale of the msw solution",
    "has been discussed  @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we have applied case 3 , in which the mass scale of @xmath174 is suitable for the vacuum solution of snp ( @xmath192 ev@xmath8 ) .",
    "case 3 and case 2 become equivalent if @xmath164 ev@xmath8 since the msw and the vacuum oscillations for the @xmath29 flux would be nearly identical at this mass scale , as shown in section iv . for case 4 to survive , @xmath174 needs to be in the order of @xmath192 ev@xmath8 for the vacuum solution to apply .",
    "therefore , consequences for case 4 and case 1 become equivalent in the detection of supernova neutrinos if @xmath164 ev@xmath8 .    in this work , responses at both super - kamiokande and sno detectors to neutrino fluxes coming from a supernova are studied under the consideration of uncertainties in neutrino temperatures . in particular , some phenomenological consequences for direct - mass and inverted - mass patterns of neutrinos are compared .",
    "we may summarize our results as follows .",
    "( a ) uncertainties in neutrino temperatures can allow various interpretations of neutrino parameters .",
    "we have shown this through the expected outcomes at super - kamiokande for sn neutrinos .",
    "( b ) the three candidates la , sa , and js manifest differently in the ratio @xmath154 at sno even if the uncertainties in neutrino temperature are allowed .",
    "future detection of sn neutrinos at sno would be able to single out favored mass and mixing parameters from the three candidates .",
    "( c ) in addition to the direct - mass pattern , the inverted - mass scenario @xmath1 is investigated since it can allow the vacuum solution to the solar neutrino problem . by using the event ratio @xmath182 in sno , the direct - mass(@xmath0 ) and the inverted - mass(@xmath1 ) could be distinguished if a nearly complete @xmath189 conversion occurs in the anti - neutrino section .",
