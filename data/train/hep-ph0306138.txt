    "the high energy part of this spectrum will mainly include photons with definite helicity @xmath5 .",
    "the sm cross section of @xmath6 at energies greater than @xmath7 gev is about @xmath8 pb and remains constant up to higher energies of interest  @xcite .",
    "this large cross section will ensure very high event rates .",

    "[ sec2 ] .",
    "one expects that a study of charge asymmetries will be a sensitive tool to study new physics effects .",
    "therefore , all mechanisms leading to this asymmetry should be investigated in detail . in the following",
    "we study the charge asymmetry in the standard model ( sm ) and make preliminary considerations on how these asymmetries change due to some possible effects of new physics .",
    "numerical results ( including all plots ) have been obtained with the comphep package  @xcite in a version which allows to set the initial photons in a definite helicity state and to implement realistic photon energy spectra .",
    "the following cuts are applied below : ( 1 ) an angular cut on the muons scattering angles given by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 mrad ( corresponding to the tesla detector angular limitations ) ; ( 2 ) a cut on muons transverse momentum @xmath12 gev , both on each muon and on the couple of muons .",
    "these two cuts help to suppress the background .",
    "we discuss two effects of charge asymmetry : + @xmath13 asymmetry of @xmath0 and @xmath1 momenta in each event , averaged over events in the process @xmath14 where both muons are recorded .",

    "the value of the interference with the dominant drd is roughly the same , since drd are large only in two regions of the final phase space corresponding to @xmath9 resonances .",
    "the other contributions do not have these two peaks .",
    "the asymmetry is present in the double - resonant contribution .",
    "there are no reasons to expect the other diagrams to contribute to the asymmetry more than their relative contributions to the cross section .",
