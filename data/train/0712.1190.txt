    "the study of the binder cumulants for isolated systems of various sizes has been an important tool to determine the critical temperature and universal quantities of spin models @xcite and lattice gauge theory models at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the intersections among binder cumulants curves for systems of different sizes obey scaling relations often referred to as finite size scaling ( fss ) .",
    "linearization in the scaling variables is often used to derive approximate fss relations for the binder cumulants and the critical temperature that allow , in principle , simple linear extrapolations to infinite volume @xcite . however , in practice , the errors bars on the intersections are often of the same order as the finite size variations and the linearity of the data is not always obvious .",
    "examples of such graphs are figure 7 in @xcite or figures 3 , 4 and 6 of @xcite .",
    "for this reason , authors will sometimes prefer to rely on a single intersection for the two largest volumes available that has potentially smaller errors @xcite .",
    "a possible source of systematic error in these infinite volume extrapolations are the nonlinear terms that have been neglected in the derivation of the linear fss formulas . if these effects are small enough , it is difficult to disentangle them from the statistical errors .",
    "typically , we are talking about a 1 - 2 percent effect .",
    "this may sound small , however , for the @xmath0 hierarchical sigma models where very accurate calculations can be performed , the differences between the binder cumulants at successive values of @xmath1 are less than 2 percent for low values of @xmath1 @xcite . consequently , it is reasonable to set accuracy goals of less than 1 percent for the binder cumulants , especially if the estimate is used to establish that a particular model belongs to a known class of universality .    in this article , we discuss quantitatively the effects of the nonlinear terms in fss with an example and we propose a new procedure to obtain infinite volume estimates that are minimally distorted by the nonlinear effects .",
    "the procedure can be used for spin models or lattice gauge models and @xmath2 is a notation that can be used interchangeably for either the inverse temperature in ising - like models or @xmath3 in gauge theory .",
    "one purpose of the article is to provide a specific improvement to the common practice of using data at the same , equally spaced , values of @xmath2 for all value of the linear size @xmath1 ( we call this the  fixed interval procedure \" ) .",
    "clear examples of the fixed interval procedure can be seen in figure 6 of @xcite , figure 11 of @xcite , figure 7 of @xcite , figure 1 of @xcite and figure 1 of @xcite where the fourth order cumulant is plotted versus @xmath2 or the temperature . in the large volume limit , the cumulant becomes a function ( that we will call @xmath4 ) of the reduced variable @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the usual correlation length exponent .",
    "this function @xmath4 can be approached at sufficiently large volume by plotting the cumulant versus this reduced variable .",
    "when this is done , the data `` collapses '' up to some finite size corrections .",
    "it seems clear that in order to reduce the nonlinear effects , we should shrink the range of @xmath2 as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this idea seems simple , however its practical implementation is non - trivial .",
    "first , we need to estimate the size of the nonlinear effects .",
    "second , we only know @xmath7 with a finite accuracy and the interval can not be shrunk to a size much smaller than the uncertainties on @xmath7 .",
    "we need to find a compromise between two conflicting requirements . on one hand",
    ", the interval needs to be small enough to reduce the nonlinear effect . on the other hand ,",
    "if the interval is too small , we may not cover properly the region where the linear approximation is valid which could result in errors for the intersections .",
    "the main technical question that we address here is : can we find an optimal width for the interval were both requirements can be reasonably satisfied ?",
    "it is difficult to answer this question for the gauge or spin models discussed above because it is hard to extract the nonlinear effects from the statistical errors .",
    "in addition , we have no independent estimates of the infinite volume cumulants and calculations at large volume are cpu demanding",
    ".    we will address this question in a model where the practical issues mentioned above can be avoided , namely dyson hierarchical model @xcite with an ising measure . in this model , it possible to block spin very accurately with methods @xcite that have been recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to make very accurate calculations at very large volume ( linear size up to @xmath8 sites ) that can not be reached with ordinary monte carlo methods .",
    "the free parameter of this model has been fixed in such a way that free gaussian fields scale like in 3 dimensions .",
    "the technical details are given in [ sec : appa ] .",
    "these large volume numerical calculations will be used later to check the accuracy of estimates made using data at much smaller volumes ( linear size up to 256 sites as in existing monte carlo ( mc ) calculations ) .",
    "our presentation is focused on the estimation of the infinite volume critical temperature and the ( universal ) fourth order binder cumulant .",
    "this quantity is defined precisely in section [ sec : notations ] where we introduce other notations and state the problem .",
    "we provide a parametrization of the nonlinear effects for the fourth order cumulant in terms of two new parameters ( see equation ( [ eq : param ] ) ) .",
    "accurate numerical values of these parameters are given in [ sec : appa ] in the case of the hierarchical model .",
    "we then discuss the linearization and graphs testing its validity .",
    "the new method that we propose here ( the  shrinking interval procedure \" ) is presented in section [ sec : shrink ] .",
    "it proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , we need to estimate the size of the nonlinear effects using data at relatively small volume .",
    "we explain that the important quantity is the ratio of the linear to quadratic leading amplitudes ( called @xmath9 ) .",
    "we show in [ sec : pencil ] that this quantity can be estimated with reasonable accuracy using a pencil and a ruler on a graph showing the binder cumulant versus @xmath2 at relatively small volume .",
    "we then propose to use a shrinking range @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an adjustable small parameter which we shall see , can picked in an optimal way by localizing crossings in infinite volume extrapolations .    in section [ sec :",
    "compare ] we compare the shrinking interval procedure with the fixed interval procedure .",
    "the calculations are done using a number of values of @xmath2 and linear sizes that are typical in existing mc calculations .",
    "we emphasize that in doing these calculations , we did not use our prior knowledge of the critical temperature , binder cumulant or amplitudes given [ sec : appa ] , however we used our knowledge of the critical exponents @xmath6 and @xmath12 .",
    "we first used a fixed value of @xmath11 ( 0.05 ) and found much better result than with the fixed interval method .",
    "we then compared infinite volume extrapolations for @xmath7 and the cumulant , for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig : extraps ] where we see remarkable crossings ( among extrapolation curves for different maximal volume ) at approximately the same value of @xmath11 for the two quantities .",
    "we compared the results for this optimal value with the accurate ones and found relative errors of less than @xmath13 for @xmath7 and of less than @xmath14 for the cumulant .",
    "figure [ fig : extraps ] is the most important result of the paper .",
    "it shows that an optimal value of @xmath11 can selected using the numerical results .",
    "it is crucial to realize that the crossing means that for the optimal value of @xmath11 , results at not too large volume provide very accurate results .",
    "one should also appreciate the number of large volume calculations involved in producing the two graphs that would take a prohibitively long time for 4 dimensional lattice gauge theory .    in section [ sec : app ] , we discuss the effects of the nonlinear terms for the calculations done in the literature and we conclude with possible applications of the new method .",
    "the new method proposed in this article can be used for two types of models .",
    "first , the spin models where @xmath2 denotes the inverse temperature in appropriate units . in the literature on the 3 dimensional ising model @xcite @xmath2",
    "is often denoted @xmath15 .",
    "second , the lattice gauge models with gauge group @xmath16 at finite temperature @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of sites in the euclidean time direction and @xmath19 the lattice spacing . for these models @xmath20 is not the inverse temperature .",
    "however , if we use the one - loop scaling @xcite , @xmath21 this formula illustrates that for the finite temperature gauge model , @xmath22 implies @xmath23 because the ordered phase of these models corresponds to high @xmath24 and high @xmath2 .    in summary",
    ", the notation @xmath2 can be used for both types of models with a consistent meaning : the ordered phase corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "for this reason , we will define a reduced @xmath2 ( or @xmath15 ) variable : @xmath26 other choices such as @xmath27 lead to similar linear behavior near @xmath7 but have different nonlinear behavior .",
    "these considerations are important if we want to connect with other expansions @xcite .",
    "we now consider finite size scaling for isolated blocks in 3 dimensions .",
    "the spin models are defined on symmetric cubic lattice @xmath28 sites .",
    "the gauge models are defined @xmath29 lattices .",
    "we use the convention @xmath30 for the variable number of sites ( while @xmath18 is kept fixed ) in order to have unified notations . in both cases ,",
    "the system is not in contact with a larger system but isolated and defined with suitable boundary conditions .    under a rg transformation where the lattice spacing @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the @xmath34 are the nonlinear scaling variables which transform multiplicatively .",
    "we denote @xmath35 the only relevant scaling variable ( we will not deal with external fields ) and we will only consider the effect of the first irrelevant variable denoted @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the exponents @xmath37 , @xmath38 are known with good precision as it is the case when we are testing the hypothesis that a particular system belongs to a well studied class of universality .",
    "in addition , we assume the expansions @xmath39    we define the fourth binder cumulant as @xmath40 with @xmath41 the average of the order variable ( spin for ising , polyakov s loop in the time direction for gauge theory ) in 3 dimensions .",
    "directly related quantities appear in the literature such as @xmath42 or @xmath43 etc . due to the lack of consensus , we have picked a form that has limits that are easy to remember .",
    "both numerator and denominator are unsubtracted averages and so this quantity can be calculated at large volume without running into loss of accuracy problems occurring for subtracted averages . in the symmetric phase , @xmath44 is dominated by @xmath45 and the the correction is suppressed by one power of the volume ( the coefficient is a renormalized coupling constant ) .",
    "consequently , if @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 tends to 3 in the infinite volume limit . on the other hand in the ordered phase ,",
    "@xmath44 is dominated by @xmath49 and the limit is 1 . at fixed @xmath1 , for sufficiently small @xmath2 , @xmath48 is close to 3 and for sufficiently large @xmath2 , @xmath48 is close to 1 . as @xmath1 increases",

    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : b4 ] where one can see that the larger violations of this approximation are observed at smaller volume .",
    "the most common procedure to study the intersections of the various curves at fixed @xmath1 is to linearize equation ( [ eq : exactfss ] ) and try to extrapolate the results at infinite @xmath1 . in the rest of this article",
    ", we will consider the effects of nonlinear terms on this procedure .",
    "our main assumption will be that @xmath55 note that we have not included terms of the form @xmath56 which should appear as a consequence of the presence of @xmath57 terms in the expansion of @xmath35 because they are suppressed by a factor @xmath58 compared to the term @xmath59 .",

    ". they may look more familiar if we replace @xmath68 by @xmath69 and factor out the powers of @xmath1 . since we assume that @xmath6 and @xmath12 are known in good approximation , linear fits can used to determine the remaining unknown parameters in equation ( [ eq : linearfss ] ) .",

    "the free parameter of this model , usually denoted @xmath71 has been fixed in such a way that free gaussian fields scale like in 3 dimensions . with this choice , as the blockspinning reduces the number of sites by a factor 2 , the linear sizes are of the form @xmath72 .",
    "the details of the calculations and accurate estimates of the parameters entering in equation ( [ eq : param ] ) are given in [ sec : appa ] .",
    "in this section , we present the shrinking interval procedure advocated in the introduction",
    ". it may be useful to state all the steps that need to be followed .",
    "first , we perform linear fits of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath2 at fixed volume in a sufficiently small @xmath2 interval .",
    "we then use the linear fits at different volumes to determine the intersections called @xmath73 and @xmath74 in equation ( [ eq : linearfss ] ) .",
    "finally , we select a set of pairs @xmath75 and perform linear fits to determine the unknown coefficients in the linear fss formula equation ( [ eq : linearfss ] ) .",
    "the final result is an infinite volume extrapolation for @xmath7 and @xmath48 .",
    "we now discuss the first step .",
    "we need to specify the @xmath2 interval ( in other words , its center and width ) for calculations of @xmath48 at a given volume . given a linear size @xmath1 , we propose to use our best estimate @xmath76 of @xmath7 obtained from smaller sizes .",
    "this is an iterative procedure .",
    "we need to start with some reasonable estimate ( for instance obtained with the finite interval procedure at small size ) and then keep improving .",
    "we propose to restrict the calculation of @xmath48 to the interval parametrized in the following way : @xmath77 we do not need a very accurate value for @xmath9 . we show in [ sec : pencil ] that it is easy to estimate the order of magnitude of @xmath9 from a graph such as figure [ fig : b4 ] , using a pencil and a ruler .",
    "the value of @xmath11 needs to be chosen carefully . on one hand",
    ", we need @xmath11 small enough in order to control the nonlinear effects . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath11 is very small , we need a correspondingly good estimate of @xmath7 . in addition ,",
    "when @xmath11 is too small , the intersections may be far away from the regions where we have values of @xmath48 .",
    "these two effects could in principle compensate .",
    "unfortunately , in the example where we have done accurate calculations , they go in opposite directions .",
    "namely , the values of @xmath76 obtained from small volume data are below the true @xmath7 while the small volume intersections are above @xmath7 as can easily be seen from figure [ fig : b4 ] .",
    "we want to figure out if the two conflicting requirements can be partially satisfied for some optimally chosen value of @xmath11 .",
    "the errors on @xmath73 and @xmath74 depend not only on @xmath11 but also on @xmath76 .",
    "the choice of @xmath11 is clearly a difficult optimization problem and it is useful to make numerical experiments . in the following section",
    "we show that values of @xmath78 lead to results that compare very well with the results of [ sec : appa ] and that a reasonable compromise between the two requirements discussed above is possible .",
    "we should also mention that the use of linear fits to determine the intersections could be replaced by more sophisticated search methods .",
    "however , in calculations that are cpu demanding , and where we have only data for a few values of @xmath2 , linear fits is the most common practice .",
    "in this section , we compare fss results using the shrinking interval procedure discussed above and the fixed interval procedure where we use fixed values of @xmath2 for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations were made for the ising hierarchical model .",
    "for the fixed interval calculation , we took the same 9 values of @xmath2 : 1.176 , 1.177 , ... , 1.184 for all possible @xmath1 between 8 and 256 , or in other words , @xmath79 with @xmath80 the number of blockspinnings . for the shrinking interval procedure",
    ", we started with the fixed interval data with @xmath81 and an estimate of @xmath82 corresponding to this data .",
    "we then followed the procedure described in section [ sec : shrink ] with @xmath83 .",
    "this value of @xmath11 was selected from the compromise of having linear fits that were not blatantly off the data and at the same time keep most of the intersections within the fitted range .",
    "we also picked 9 values of @xmath2 within the specified range . at each @xmath1 , we used all the possible intersections involving the 5 closest sizes to determine @xmath76 using equation ( [ eq : linearfss ] ) .",
    "this means that we made linear fits with 15 points and the results are quite robust under small changes in the procedure .",
    "linear fits were performed for each @xmath1 in order to express @xmath48 as a linear function of @xmath2 . for each pair",
    "@xmath75 , it is possible to determine the intersection @xmath63 of the corresponding lines .",
    "these empirical values are plotted versus the calculable values @xmath84 and @xmath85 , defined in ( [ eq : lm ] ) , in figures [ fig : fixedbet ] and [ fig : fixedbin ] . in order to make the graphs readable and the dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath68 clear ,",
    "we have displayed 4 sets of 6 intersections denoted @xmath75 in the graphs .",
    "the meaning of @xmath75 is that we take the intersection between @xmath68 and all the possible lower values starting at @xmath1 .",

    "consequently , we can only set a lower bound on @xmath9 from this figure by assuming that @xmath111 , defined in [ sec : pencil ] , is less than the error bars that we estimated to be less than 0.02 .",

    "note that we are mostly interested in the ratio @xmath159 and that this ratio is invariant under a multiplicative rescaling .",
