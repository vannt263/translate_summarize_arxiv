    "we assume that all @xmath0-manifolds are closed , connected and oriented and all contact structures are co - oriented and positive throughout this paper .",

    "it follows that @xmath7 ) \\cup b)$ ] and @xmath8 ) \\cup b)$ ] are handlebodies which induce a heegaard splitting of @xmath1 , where we view @xmath6 as the interval @xmath9 $ ] whose endpoints are identified with each other . in this sense an open book is can be viewed as a special heegaard splitting .",
    "note that a stabilization of an open book at hand corresponds to a stabilization of the induced heegaard splitting .",
    "we define the heegaard genus @xmath10 of a contact @xmath0-manifold @xmath11 as the minimal genus of a heegaard surface in any heegaard splitting of @xmath1 induced from an open book supporting @xmath12 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath13 is a page of an open book supporting @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the support norm of @xmath12 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath16 denotes the euler characteristic of @xmath17 .",
    "this is certainly a generalization of the heegaard genus adapted to contact @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "it is well - known that heegaard genus is additive under connected sum of @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "here we show that heegaard genus is sub - additive but not necessarily additive under connected sum of _ contact _ @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "moreover we define the contact genus @xmath18 of a @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 as the minimal heegaard genus over all contact structures , i.e. , @xmath19 is a contact structure on @xmath20 which , by giroux s correspondence @xcite , is the minimal genus of a heegaard surface in any heegaard splitting of @xmath1 induced from an open book . in other words ,",
    "the contact genus of a @xmath0-manifold is a topological invariant obtained by taking the minimum of the sum @xmath21 over all open books , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the genus of the page and the number of binding components of the open book , respectively .",
    "we show that contact genus is sub - additive ( and conjecture that it is additive ) under connected sum of @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "we would like to point out that the contact invariant was first studied by rubinstein who named it the open book genus of @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "we prefer to call it the contact genus to emphasize its connection with contact topology .",
    "it is clear by definition that for any contact structure @xmath12 on @xmath1 we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the heegaard genus of @xmath1 . in @xcite , it was shown that `` most '' @xmath0-manifolds of heegaard genus @xmath26 have contact genus @xmath27 , which implies the existence of @xmath0-manifolds where the first inequality above is strict . in particular , it follows that not every heegaard splitting of a @xmath0-manifold comes from an open book .",
    "here we show that `` most '' @xmath0-manifolds of heegaard genus @xmath28 have contact genus @xmath29 .",
    "namely we show that a lens space which is not diffeomorphic to an oriented circle bundle over @xmath30 have contact genus @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "the contact genus of any oriented circle bundle over @xmath30 is equal its heegaard genus .",
    "we also show that there are many small seifert fibered @xmath0-manifolds ( which are not lens spaces ) which have this property .",
    "examples of such @xmath0-manifolds were constructed in @xcite , but our examples are much simpler .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for more on open books and contact structures .",
    "given any two contact @xmath0-manifolds @xmath32 and @xmath33 . by removing a darboux ball from each of these contact @xmath0-manifolds and gluing them along their convex boundaries by an orientation reversing map carrying respective characteristic foliations onto each other",
    "we get a well defined contact structure @xmath34 on the connected sum @xmath35 . the contact @xmath0-manifold @xmath36 is called the contact connected sum of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is well - known that heegaard genus is additive under connected sum of smooth @xmath0-manifolds , which follows from haken s lemma .",
    "here we show that    [ con ] the heegaard genus is sub - additive but not necessarily additive under connected sum of contact @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the open book realizing @xmath38 , for @xmath39 .",
    "then the contact structure @xmath40 on @xmath35 is supported by the open book @xmath41 obtained by plumbing the pages of the open books @xmath42 and @xmath43 by torisu @xcite .",
    "denote a page of the open book @xmath37 by @xmath44 .",
    "it follows that @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the page of the open book @xmath47 .",
    "thus we have @xmath48 which implies that @xmath49 is sub - additive under contact connected sum .",
    "ext we show that @xmath49 is not necessarily additive under contact connected sum .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the overtwisted contact structure in @xmath51 whose @xmath52 invariant ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is equal to the half integer @xmath53 .",
    "the following result was obtained in @xcite : if @xmath54 is a contact structure with @xmath55 torsion , then @xmath56    now suppose that @xmath1 is an integral homology sphere .",
    "it follows that @xmath57 for every contact structure @xmath12 on @xmath1 , and @xmath1 carries a unique spin@xmath58 structure .",
    "thus for an arbitrary contact structure @xmath12 on @xmath1 we have @xmath59 which implies that the connected sum @xmath60 is homotopic to @xmath12 as oriented plane fields ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact , @xmath60 is isotopic to @xmath12 by the classification of overtwisted contact structures due to eliashberg @xcite . as a consequence we have @xmath61    on the other hand , in ( @xcite , lemma 5.5 )",
    ", it was proved that @xmath62 .",
    "note that an open book realizing @xmath63 can be described by taking a pair of pants as a page and @xmath64 as the monodromy , where @xmath65 denotes a right - handed dehn twist along a boundary component .",
    "consequently we have    @xmath66",
    "here we provide some basic properties of the contact genus of @xmath0-manifolds , and compute this invariant for some @xmath0-manifolds .        for a @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath18 is obtained by taking the minimum of the sum @xmath21 over all open books , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the genus of the page and the number of binding components of an open book , respectively .",
    "hence we have @xmath71 for an arbitrary @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 , since @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is clear that the absolute minimum of the expression @xmath21 is realized when @xmath74 and @xmath75 and the open book with disk pages and trivial monodromy supports the unique tight contact structure on @xmath51 , which proves ( @xmath76 ) .    to prove ( @xmath77 ) , we note that @xmath78 is realized if and only if @xmath74 and @xmath79 .",
    "any self - diffeomorphism of an annulus is given by @xmath80 , for some @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the core of the annulus , and @xmath83 denotes a right - handed dehn twist along @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath84 , this open book supports the unique tight contact structure on the lens space @xmath85 which is an oriented circle bundle over @xmath30 with euler number @xmath86 .",
    "otherwise ( i.e. , when @xmath87 ) the induced contact structure is the overtwisted contact structure on @xmath88 which is an oriented circle bundle over @xmath30 with euler number @xmath86 . combining , we showed that @xmath70 if and only if @xmath1 is an oriented circle bundle over @xmath30 , which is not diffeomorphic to @xmath51 .",
    "it follows from @xcite that @xmath92 has a planar open book with at most three binding components , which indeed proves that @xmath98 . moreover , under the assumption that @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , the @xmath0-manifold @xmath92 is not diffeomorphic to any lens space and hence @xmath101 by proposition  [ basic ] .",
    "when we drop the assumption on @xmath102 and @xmath23 in lemma  [ ba ] , we observe that @xmath92 is diffeomorphic to either @xmath51 , @xmath103 , a lens space , or certain connected sums of these for some values of the integers @xmath102 and @xmath23 .",
    "note that lemma  [ ba ] exhibits examples of @xmath0-manifolds @xmath104 for which @xmath105 , although most @xmath0-manifolds of heegaard genus @xmath26 have contact genus @xmath106 as was shown by rubinstein @xcite .      since @xmath109 , we know that @xmath110 . hence to show that @xmath111 , we just need to realize this lower bound by a heegaard splitting of @xmath112 induced from an open book .",
    "we use the fact that the unique tight contact structure on @xmath112 is supported by an planar open book with @xmath113 binding components , whose monodromy is the identity map .",
