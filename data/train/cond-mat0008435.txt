    "coiling is a common occurrence in vastly different systems and on many scales , ranging from carbon nano - tubes @xcite and dna molecules @xcite , to telephone cords and tendrils of climbing plants @xcite .",
    "the framework most commonly used to model coiling in these and other systems is that of an elastic rod .",
    "buckling of the central line is explained by showing that converting twist to writhe lowers the elastic energy @xcite .",
    "we study the coiling of cylindrical stacks of lipid membranes @xcite , called _ myelin figures _ , interacting with an amphiphilic polymer .",
    "this polymer has several hydrophobic side groups attached along a flexible hydrophilic backbone , which it inserts into the membranes in order to shield them from the surrounding water @xcite .",
    "the membranes composing a myelin figure are in a two - dimensional liquid state , and therefore can not support twist .",
    "application of torque on the cylinder simply leads to flow of material around the tube .",
    "thus the interplay between twist and writhe can not explain the coiling observed in our experiments .",
    "the existence and coiling of myelin figures has been observed as far back as 1854 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , similar shapes have been observed during the hydration of a surfactant by brine @xcite .",
    "coiling of myelin figures has also been reported for a system of egg - yolk lecithin @xcite .",
    "this system is a mixture containing many different lipids , having a variety of tail lengths and degrees of saturation @xcite . in another experiment",
    "it was shown that a binary mixture of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin forms single and double helices in the presence of calcium ions @xcite . in these two studies ,",
    "it was claimed that : _ ( i ) _ the energy gained by surface adhesion overcomes the energy cost of bending a tube , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the tighter the coil , the longer the line of contact between tubes becomes , thus increasing the area of contact .",
    "in contrast , our experiments clearly show that surface adhesion is negligible in our system . in order to account for coiling in our experiments",
    ", we present a simple model , in which we assume that polymer molecules locally induce spontaneous curvature . the coiling instability results from a coupling between local polymer concentration and membrane curvature .",
    "within such a framework , hollow tubes may also undergo other shape instabilities such as pearling @xcite .",
    "however , the constraints imposed by the geometry of the cylindrical membrane stack prevent them from occurring .",
    "our model predicts the occurrence of maximally tight coils above a threshold polymer concentration .",
    "indeed , only maximally curved coils were formed in our experiments .",
    "a theoretical analysis shows that virtual slices through maximally curved helices can be very similar to the observed images .",
    "section [ materials ] describes the materials and methods used in our experiments .",
    "section [ results ] describes the types of coils observed , and shows that adhesion does not play a major role in these experiments .",
    "section [ theory ] presents the simple model that explains the major findings .",
    "first , a heuristic argument is given as to why such an approach works .",
    "then the full mean - field calculation is given .",
    "finally , section [ image - model ] outlines the difficulties in comparing quantitatively the model and the experiment .",
    "vesicles were made of stearoyl - oleoyl - phosphatidylcholine ( sopc ) with @xmath0 alkyl chains .",
    "the polymer used is hydrophilic dextran ( mw 162,000 g / mol ) functionalized both with palmitoyl alkyl chains and dodecanoic nbd chains as fluorescent markers .",
    "the hydrophobic anchors , distributed statistically along the backbone ( about 1 alkyl chain per 25 glucose units ) are @xmath1 long . on average",
    "there are about 4 persistence lengths between consecutive anchors .",
    "therefore , the extension of each polymer molecule on the two - dimensional membrane is much larger than its extension into the third dimension .",
    "events were observed by phase contrast microscopy and recorded on video .",
    "for fluorescence imaging the nbd markers were excited with argon laser illumination , and observed with a cooled ccd camera .",
    "samples were prepared by drying a 0.5 - 1.0@xmath2l droplet of sopc dissolved in a 4:1 chloroform - methanol solution ( 7.35mg / ml ) on a glass slide .",
    "the sample was then closed from the top and sides , and hydration was effected by injecting a polymer solution of known concentration , @xmath3 , into the closed cell .",
    "some time after hydration , a variety of self - assembled structures formed , including myelin figures .",
    "all the structures observed in these experiments were still connected to a lipid reservoir , allowing exchange of material , including both lipids and polymer molecules .",
    "experiments were conducted at room temperature , well above the solid - liquid transition for sopc .",
    "this allowed free diffusion of anchored polymers along the membranes .",
    "we stress that while the polymer concentration in solution , @xmath3 , is known , we do not control the surface concentration on the bilayers .",
    "the slow evolution of some of the structures we observe is consistent with a possible variation of this concentration over time .",
    "electron micrographs of cross sections of myelin figures reveal that they are rodlike lyotropic liquid - crystalline structures containing a large number ( hundreds to thousands ) of concentric cylindrical membranes separated by thin hydration layers @xcite .",
    "the smectic order in these stacks of membranes is not ideal , as many defects are present .",
    "the outer radius of a myelin figure can reach tens of microns , while the radius of the water - core may be of the order of , or smaller than optical resolution ( 0.2@xmath2 ) .",
    "the myelin figures , which are connected at one end to a large lipid reservoir , are continuously elongating .",
    "the rate of elongation of a myelin figure lies in the range of @xmath4 . throughout the experiment ,",
    "polymer molecules continue to anchor from the surrounding solution .",
    "hence we assume that there is continuous accumulation of both lipid and polymer molecules .",
    "hydration of a patch of lipids by a polymer solution of small @xmath5 results in the formation of myelin figures , which display a clear tendency to straighten over lengths many times larger than their diameter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : straight ] ) .",
    "as @xmath5 is increased , myelin figures become more floppy and curved . for large enough values of @xmath5 , a writhing instability sets in and tubes bend , forming irregular structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ball ] ) , single coils ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spring]a ) and double helices ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dbl - coil ] ) .",
    "the type of coiled structure formed , depends in great part on the dynamics of the formation process . by far",
    "the most common event is for the tip to begin to curve in upon itself forming a seemingly irregular ball - like structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ball ] ) .",
    "however , when the ball is large enough , some sort of ordering can be seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kink]e ) .",
    "coils that start forming at their bases usually evolve into nearly ideal single helices .",
    "the uncoiled part of the tube leading to the tip is pulled in and wound around to form the next loop @xcite . in cases where the coiling starts in the middle",
    ", it begins as a hairpin that rotates around itself , and the instability then proceeds in both directions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] ) .",
    "this may result either in the formation of a tightly packed sphere or a double helix .",
    "at the site where the instability nucleates , the tube goes from nearly straight to maximally curved .",
    "the instability then propagates from this site to the rest of the tube ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ball ] and [ fig : kink ] ) .",
    "the observed evolution may be due to a gradual change in the concentration of polymer molecules on the membrane .",
    "all the coiled structures we observe are maximally curved already _ as they form _ and do not tighten up gradually , unlike the experiments reported by sakurai et al . @xcite . in quantitative terms",
    ", this means that the curvature of the tube central line , @xmath6 , is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the radius of the tube .    in previously reported cases @xcite ,",
    "coiling of myelin figures was attributed to surface adhesion .",
    "this is clearly not the case in our system , as demonstrated by the experiment illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spring ] .",
    "the tip of a myelin figure , in the process of coiling , adhered to an air bubble , which we then moved .",
    "movement of the bubble stretched the coil ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spring]a - c ) , until the latter reached a configuration in which all self - contact was lost ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spring]c ) .",
    "note also that the coil is stretched more or less homogeneously . upon detachment from the bubble , the coil retracted as if it was an ordinary spring ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spring]d - g ) .",
    "had surface adhesion been the dominant mechanism , one would not expect the response of a coil to mechanical stretching to be homogeneous , but rather to come apart at the site of weakest contact .",
    "furthermore , adhesion can not create a restoring force .",
    "thus , if the coil is stretched open so that no contact sites are left , the tube should `` forget '' that it was coiled .",
    "if the force exerted on the end of the tube is then released , adhesion would induce coil formation starting at one point and propagating to the rest of the tube ( similarly to the original formation process ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast with our experimental observations .",
    "another piece of evidence against adhesion in our system is provided by the presence of many other structures in our experiments that come into contact with one another , but do not adhere ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : contact ] ) .    in order to understand better the role that the polymer plays in the coiling phenomenon ,",
    "it is important to know its location in the membrane stack . for this purpose ,",
    "fluorescence imaging was used .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flo - tube ] . as can be seen",
    ", the fluorescence intensity through the slice is concave .",
    "this is what one expects for a homogeneous polymer distribution throughout the stack , since in that case , the intensity should be roughly proportional to the thickness of the tube in the microscope slice . from this",
    "we infer that the polymer is present , in significant quantity , throughout the myelin figure .",
    "images of hollow tubes , where the polymer sits predominantly on the outer layers , have a convex fluorescence intensity profile through their cross sections .",
    "we now present a simple theoretical model that captures most of the key experimental observations . for simplicity , we regard the system as if it were in equilibrium , effectively ignoring the slow evolution of the observed structures . consider a stack of concentric cylindrical sheets .",
    "we represent each bilayer as two square lattices ( in the spirit of lattice - gas models ) , corresponding to the outer and inner monolayers .",
    "each site represents a patch of membrane having area @xmath9 , approximately the size of a polymer molecule performing a two - dimensional random walk on the membrane .",
    "each lattice site has two degrees of freedom associated with it : the local mean curvature , @xmath10 , and a binary occupation variable , @xmath11 , that takes the values one or zero when the site is occupied or unoccupied by a polymer molecule , respectively . to estimate the area of a site",
    "we assume that the hydrophilic backbone is in a good solvent ( water ) under semi - dilute conditions .",
    "this gives a radius of gyration , @xmath12 nm .",
    "the energy of the system is a sum of the curvature energies of the sites : @xmath13 for a vacant site , and @xmath14 for a site occupied by a polymer . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the local bending rigidities of a monolayer without and with an attached polymer , respectively , and @xmath17 is the spontaneous curvature induced by the polymer .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 , since the addition of polymer tends to bend membranes into shapes with higher curvatures .",
    "for the purpose of this simple model , the exact molecular mechanism responsible for this is not important .",
    "possible mechanisms include the entropic pressure of the polymer backbone , or the incommensurability between the anchors and lipids . by convention ,",
    "the curvatures of the inner and outer monolayers of the bilayer have opposite signs at the same position .",
    "a crucial assumption is that polymer molecules can diffuse along the membrane , since the membrane is in a fluid state .",
    "in addition , we assume that the fluctuations of each membrane in a stack are severely restricted by the presence of its neighbors . as a result , there is a strong correlation between the transversal fluctuations throughout the tube .",
    "the myelin figure can thus be regarded as a flexible rod , having a circular cross section everywhere along its axis .",
    "the experimental pictures indeed display unchanging circular cross sections within experimental error .",
    "based on these assumptions , we developed a model that predicts that a high enough polymer concentration on the membrane can shift the equilibrium state , from a straight tube to a maximally curved one .",
    "we first present a heuristic argument to show that if the spontaneous curvature , @xmath19 , is large enough , the free energy of a bent tube may be lower than that of a straight one .",
    "this approach may give a more intuitive understanding than the detailed calculations that follow .      in order to find the equilibrium state of a tube",
    ", we have to calculate its free energy .",
    "this free energy depends on the curvature of its central line , @xmath6 , and on the polymer concentration .",
    "consider one cylindrical bilayer of length @xmath20 and circular cross section of radius @xmath21 , with the same average polymer concentration , @xmath22 , on both sides .",
    "@xmath22 is defined as the number of polymer molecules on a monolayer , @xmath23 , divided by the total number of sites on a monolayer , i.e. @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total area of the membrane segment .",
    "let us calculate the free energy cost of bending the bilayer into a portion of a coil with central line curvature @xmath6 in three steps .",
    "first , we bend the tube while keeping the distribution of polymer around the tube homogeneous .",
    "next , we allow the polymer to diffuse from regions of lower curvature to regions of higher curvature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) , and finally , we consider the entropy of mixing .",
    "the energy of a bent cylindrical bilayer with a _ homogeneous _ polymer distribution is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the energies of the outer and inner monolayers , respectively .",
    "according to our model    @xmath29 ^ 2 + 2(1-\\rho_{0})\\kappa\\int da\\left[h^{\\pm}(c,\\phi)\\right]^2~ , \\label{eq : ehom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the angle around the tube , @xmath31 is the local membrane curvature , and @xmath32 . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume here that @xmath33 .",
    "in the full model we allow the possibility that the presence of the polymer affects the local bending rigidity ( i.e. @xmath34 ) .",
    "for our geometry the total mean curvature obeys @xmath35 , independent of @xmath6 .",

    "however , the price is independent of the value of @xmath19 .",
    "next , we take into account inhomogeneities in the distribution of polymer around the tube .",
    "such inhomogeneities reduce the energy , if polymers move to regions of membrane curvature closer to @xmath19 in both the outer and inner monolayers .",
    "rewriting eq .",

    "the detailed calculation ( see below ) shows that such configurations indeed exist .    as for the entropy of the system , we assume that the dominant contribution is the entropy of mixing of the polymers and lipids .",
    "this entropy is larger when the distribution of polymers around the cylindrical bilayer is homogeneous , favoring a straight tube .",

    "therefore , it is extremely difficult to reconstruct the objects which correspond to the experimental images .    could the tight complex coils observed experimentally ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] ) have maximal central line curvature everywhere ?",
    "in view of the difficulties outlined above , we can only partially answer this question . in order to fully define a curve in three - dimensional space",

    "thus , we can only simulate the simplest structures observed experimentally .",
    "the curvatures of these structures are consistent with the prediction of the model ; i.e. , they are maximally curved .",
    "while our model explains the observed phenomena , other models were proposed in the literature to explain coiling in other systems .",
    "the discussion is devoted to these other possibilities .",
    "the coiling of dmpc - cardiolipin myelin figures was attributed to @xmath106-mediated membrane - membrane binding @xcite .",
    "surface adhesion was also suggested as the dominant mechanism responsible for the coiling of egg - yolk lecithin myelin figures @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that the gain in energy coming from surface adhesion overcomes the elastic energy required to bend the tube .",
    "furthermore it was postulated that by twisting back along its length , a rod increases the length of the line of contact , thereby increasing the area of contact .",
    "an analysis of simple helices shows that this is not generally true .",
    "this is shown in the appendix .",
    "first , there may be up to four lines of contact , depending on the type of double helix .",
    "moreover , the length of the line of contact is not simply related to how tight the structure is .",
    "in fact the maximum length of the line of contact occurs when the two helices revolve around a large radius , thereby being effectively straight . in our system",
    "we have found strong evidence that surface adhesion does not play a dominant role in determining the morphology .",
    "a generalization of our model may be relevant to other multicomponent systems .",
    "for example , calcium is known to induce a lateral phase separation in a lipid mixture containing cardiolipin , thereby creating an inhomogeneous distribution .",
    "egg - yolk lecithin is also a mixture of lipids with the same head - group , and a variety of tail - lengths and degrees of saturation @xcite .",
    "another type of curvature model - the area difference elasticity ( ade ) model - was discussed in the literature @xcite . in this approach",
    "it is assumed that each monolayer has a certain preferred area .",
    "if there is an area difference between the monolayers comprising a bilayer , then the bilayer will bend in order to accommodate it . in effect",
    "ade and sc both predict the same equilibrium shapes for hollow vesicles .",
    "however , ade can not explain the coiling of myelin figures .",
    "this is because bending a tube , so that it is part of a torus , does not change its area .",
    "this is true for each monolayer in the stack , and in particular , the area difference between layers is unchanged .",
    "we believe coiling occurs mainly due to the spontaneous curvature induced by the presence of the polymer molecules as well as their mobility .",
    "our model emphasizes these aspects , and neglects others such as membrane distortions due to the polymer backbone and interactions between polymers .",
    "we do not expect these effects to change the qualitative behavior of the system .",
    "we thank especially l. jullien , for his help and encouragement .",
    "we also acknowledge useful exchanges with r. lipowsky , e. moses and s. safran .",
    "this research was supported by the israel science foundation administered by the israel academy of sciences and humanities - recanati and idb group foundation and the minerva foundation .",
    "the requirement that a physical coil does not intersect itself imposes a constraint on the relation between the pitch and the radius of a helix .",
    "this constraint , as well as the lines of contact , are now calculated for single and double helices .",
    "some of the helices studied here were considered also in @xcite .          where @xmath108 is the radius of the helix around the z - axis , @xmath109 is the pitch , and @xmath110 is a parameter running along the curve . from this",
    "we see that the curvature is @xmath111 , while the torsion is given by @xmath112 .        where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the normal and binormal to the curve at point @xmath110 and @xmath116 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tube - vars ] .",
    "the demand that a physical tube does not intersect itself yields two conditions :      \\2 ) the pitch of the coil must be such that a segment of the coil does not intersect any previous segment .",
    "this requirement can be checked numerically by determining the distance between any two points along the curve , and demanding this distance to be greater or equal to @xmath120 .",
    "the result is another constraint on @xmath121 .",
    "helices for which this distance equals @xmath120 have a contact line which is a helix with the same radius and pitch as the central line , but shifted by @xmath122 along the line of symmetry .",
    "the allowed parameters are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : single - phase ] .",
    "we consider a double helix as two single helices , having radii @xmath108 and @xmath123 , that have at least one continuous line of contact .",
    "if there is no such contact then they are simply two unconnected single helices . for simplicity",
    "we assume that both tubes have the same radius @xmath122 around their respective central lines , and that these central lines wind around the z - axis .",
    "the line of contact is itself a helix with the same pitch , and with a radius @xmath124 .",
    "the constraint of having a distance of @xmath120 between the two central lines allows us to find @xmath108 as a function of @xmath123 and h.    there are two types of double helices .",
    "type i double helices have @xmath125 . in this case , the two helices wind around their line of contact and their radii obey @xmath126 .",
    "double helices of type ii obey the condition @xmath127 . in this case",
    ", the coils are intermingled and wind around a hole in the middle .",
    "type ii double helices have at least two lines of contact ( an example is shown in structure d of fig .",
    "[ fig : sample - helices ] .",
    "this is summarized as a phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : dbl - phase ] .",
    "the phase @xmath129 is @xmath130 for double helices of types i and ii , and for loose helices @xmath129 is determined by the requirement that there exists at least one line of contact .",
    "the line of contact is then given by @xmath131 . from the requirement",
    "that @xmath132 and that @xmath133 we find that the line of contact is a helix with the same pitch as the other two helices , and a radius :        double helices of type i have one line of contact , while type ii helices typically have two lines of contact . at the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dbl - phase ] the two lines merge .",
    "type ii helices lying on the line of self intersection also have lines of self contact , for a total of four lines of contact .",
    "the maximal length of contact lines occurs when one helix lies within the other and their radii go to infinity . in this case",
    "the total length of contact is four times the length of the central line of each helix .",
    "thus , formation of a tighter helix does not necessarily mean that the line of contact increases , not to mention the area of contact .",
    "the area of contact between two cylinders depends on the angle at which they come into contact .",
    "moreover , when there are two lines of contact close together ( for example near the dotted line in fig.[fig : dbl - phase ] ) the areas of contact must overlap to some degree ."
