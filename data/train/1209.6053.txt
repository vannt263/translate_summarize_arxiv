    "gbm is an all sky monitor whose primary objective is to extend the energy range over which gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are observed in the large area telescope ( lat ) on fermi @xcite .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : bolo ]      the energy spectrum of thermonuclear bursts is for most purposes well described by a simple absorbed blackbody model . at the peak ( near the flux maximum ) bursts",
    "can show a wide variety of light curve shapes and spectral evolution .",
    "in particular , the peak of photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) bursts features a drastic increase of the blackbody radius @xmath20 and an associated drop of the blackbody temperature @xmath21 , due to the effect of radiation forces on the ns photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . subsequently the photosphere contracts and heats up until it reaches the ns surface again , at `` touchdown '' .",
    "most low-@xmath2 bursts are pre events ( of either normal or long duration class ) as the high ignition depths power energetic and luminous events that can overcome the gravitational force at the photosphere .",
    "soft x - ray sensitivity is necessary in order to observe the full radius expansion phase of pre bursts , due to the simultaneous drop in temperature which shifts the spectrum to lower energies .",
    "conversely , the lack of spectroscopic evidence for pre when observing a given burst in the hard x - ray band does not rule out the pre nature of the burst .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : iceberg ] , where we compare the spectral evolution of a long pre burst from 4u  0614 + 09 observed in 2001 with broadband spectral coverage to one of the gbm bursts presented herein . in all cases except b3 and b13",
    "the fluxes , temperatures and blackbody radii measured during our gbm bursts are consistent with those measured near the `` touchdown '' phase of a pre burst ( figure  [ fig : iceberg ] shows one example , b7 )",
    ". thus most thermonuclear bursts detected with gbm ( and perhaps with any hard x - ray wide field detector ) are in fact consistent with pre bursts in the touchdown phase . however , as our gbm x - ray burst search includes faint and untriggered events we are also sensitive to fainter , sub - eddington bursts , as witnessed by the detection of b3 and b13 ( table  [ table : bprop ] & figure  [ fig : bspec ] ) .",
    "all the gbm bursts presented herein are much shorter than the segment of the long burst detected by fregate .",
    "this , together with the simulations described below , indicates that all bursts b1b15 are normal duration bursts , even after bandpass corrections are applied .",
    "due to its spectral evolution , a given burst can produce very different light curves when observed with instruments with different bandpasses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is of particular relevance when studying thermonuclear bursts with a hard x - ray detector , as many of the burst photons are emitted outside the energy range to which the instrument is sensitive to .",
    "whenever a burst is clearly detected , its thermal spectrum is usually well constrained using the hard x - ray band and the bolometric flux can therefore be measured , under the assumption that color and effective temperatures are equal .",
    "however , the actual burst detection relies on having sufficient burst photons emitted in the instrument band to rise significantly above the background rate . in practice",
    ", this implies that instruments like gbm ( sensitive to photon energies above 8  kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fregate ( sensitive above 6  kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bat or ibis - isgri ( sensitive above 15  kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) are able to detect only the hottest ( @xmath221.52  kev ) and relatively long - lived phases of bursts ( see figure  [ fig : iceberg ] ) . thus in general the radiated energy and duration measured in the hard x - ray band (",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ) are lower limits to the total burst fluence and duration ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "this was illustrated by the long burst from xte  j1701407 detected with both the xrt ( sensitive in the 0.510  kev band ) and bat instruments onboard _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "in that case @xmath25 and @xmath26 exceeded those measured in the bat ( 1550  kev ) band by a factor of @xmath273.9 and @xmath2820 , respectively @xcite .    in order to quantify this combined bandpass and background effect for the gbm bursts from 4u  0614 + 09 and to estimate the total radiated energy and duration , we simulated gbm light curves using two of the bursts reported by : the long pre burst shown in figure  [ fig : iceberg ] and a normal duration burst .",
    "we created a response matrix for one gbm nai detector ( n0 , 14@xmath17 off - axis ; ctime mode ) and used the spectral parameters from both bursts ( with a 10  s time resolution ) to simulate net light curves within xspec ( v. 12.7.0 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we calculated count rates in the energy range 1225  kev ( ctime channel 1 ) , the band used in our systematic search ( sec .",
    "[ sec : search ] ) .",
    "we then added the net burst counts to a real background light curve which includes contributions from particle background and x - ray sources in the field of view , both variable typically on timescales @xmath29100  s. finally , we measured the energy ( from the integrated fluence , using the 3.2  kpc distance ) and duration of each burst in the sub - interval detected by gbm .",
    "the resulting simulated light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : simulate ] ( right panels ) .",
    "the long burst seen in the gbm band would present a characteristic slow rise ( @xmath19@xmath1265  s ) and last for a total of about 140  s. the simulated normal duration burst , on the other hand , has a rise time ( 6.4  s ) , energy ( 3.6@xmath1110@xmath6  erg ) and duration ( 30  s ) similar to all gbm bursts presented herein ( table  [ table : bprop ] ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : simulate ] by comparing two of the gbm bursts ( left panels ; b4 & b8 ) with the simulated long and normal burst light curves ( right panels ) .",
    "we conclude that all bursts detected from 4u  0614 + 09 during the first year of our gbm x - ray burst search are normal duration bursts , yet as discussed below they are more energetic than most normal duration bursts .",
    "table  [ table : bolo ] presents the duration and energy of the long and normal duration bursts , as measured with three different instruments and bandpasses : gbm , fregate and pca .",
    "the gbm values are estimated from the simulations explained above , while fregate and pca values are taken from .",
    "the bolometric correction factors for energy and duration are given for each case .",
    "fregate was able to detect a slightly longer portion of the bursts .",
    "although fregate also consisted of nai scintillation detectors with effective area similar to that of the gbm detectors , its lower energy threshold ( 6  kev ) and smaller field of view ( which reduces x - ray background ) made it sensitive to a larger fraction of the bursts .",
    "the bandpass used has a clear effect on the measured burst energy , with @xmath30 in the range 1.31.7 ( 1.34 if we include the xrt / bat long burst from * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the same is true for the commonly used characteristic burst timescale @xmath31 .",
    "the impact on the measured burst duration is much more drastic , as @xmath32 can be anywhere between 1.5 and 55 .",
    "this is because cooling tails can extend for a long time ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are detected only with soft x - ray detectors , yet most of the energy is radiated during the hottest , most luminous phases of bursts which are captured to a greater extent by hard x - ray detectors .",
    "thus in general burst energy constitutes a more robust ( less band - dependent ) observable than burst duration .",
    "as normal duration bursts from 4u  0614 + 09 have not been observed with pointed soft x - ray detectors , we can not find the bolometric correction factors for the case of normal duration bursts from 4u  0614 + 09 observed with gbm . based on our gbm simulation and the fregate normal duration burst",
    ", we estimate that in this case @xmath272 ( table  [ table : bolo ] ) , i.e. , normal bursts are about twice as energetic as seen in the gbm band .      in figure",
    "[ fig : trecmdot ] we compare the @xmath4 measured in 4u  0614 + 09 , when @xmath2 was between 0.6% and 1.3% , to the constraints available for other low-@xmath2 bursters and a few selected systems .",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath2 relations for two `` well - behaved '' bursters accreting at a few percent of @xmath33 are shown for comparison @xcite . in those cases",
    "@xmath4 is shorter than a day and thus much easier to measure .",
    "for comparison , he ignition curves for pure he accretion are also shown , for two different values of the heat flux from the crust ( @xmath34=1  mev / nucleon and @xmath34=3  mev / nucleon ; see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the large change in predicted @xmath4 illustrates the sensitivity of low-@xmath2 bursts to the thermal properties of the crust .",
    "these models , however , predict burst energies much higher than the observed ones .",
    "detailed modeling of the burst properties is beyond the scope of this work , and we refer the reader to for further discussion .",
    "it is interesting to compare the distribution of burst energies from 4u  0614 + 09 with that of the normal duration and long / intermediate burst populations ( see figure  [ fig : hist ] ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : band ] , burst energy is less sensitive to bandpass effects than burst duration , and may constitute a more robust observable for burst classification .",
    "4u  0614 + 09 has on average larger @xmath25 than normal duration bursts , yet smaller @xmath25 than long / intermediate duration bursts .",
    "the energies of the two long bursts from 4u  0614 + 09 , however , are consistent with the rest of the long burst population . even after bandpass effects are corrected for , 4u  0614 + 09 bridges the gap between normal duration and long / intermediate bursts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "this could be due to a fuel composition different than most ultracompact lmxbs that would give rise to atypical bursts , if as it has been suggested the donor star has unusual abundances ( h and he defficient ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the previously observed bimodal distribution of burst durations could be due to a selection effect .",
    "prior to our gbm campaign , observations of low-@xmath2 bursts were mostly based on serendipitous detections with hard x - ray wide - field instruments .",
    "if such serendipitous and so far relatively scarce detections are biased towards the longest and most energetic events , a population of infrequent , low-@xmath2 bursts with energies and durations between normal and long bursts could have gone unnoticed .",
    "our gbm all - sky search ( sec .",
    "[ sec : search ] ) is the first systematic survey of low-@xmath2 bursts and is less biased towards long and energetic events . a continuous distribution in @xmath25 ( between 10@xmath6  erg and 10@xmath8  erg )",
    "is actually not surprising from the standpoint of he ignition models @xcite .",
    "this is , as far as we know , the first time that such continuous distribution is observed . extending this study to similar bursters",
    "will determine if the distribution of burst energies that we find ( figure  [ fig : hist ] ) is unique to 4u  0614 + 09 or a common feature of low-@xmath2 bursters .",
    "the average burst energy in our sample , after the bolometric correction factor of @xmath122 is applied ( sec .",
    "[ sec : band ] ) , is 5@xmath1110@xmath6  erg . for the measured @xmath4 ( 12  d ) and @xmath1 ( 2.3@xmath1110@xmath35  erg  s@xmath36 )",
    ", this corresponds to an accretion - to - burst fluence ratio @xmath37  @xmath12  560 , while the accreted column depth at the average inferred @xmath2 ( 1.1@xmath1110@xmath38  g  @xmath39  s@xmath36 ) is @xmath40  @xmath12  1@xmath1110@xmath41  g  @xmath39 , similar to the values obtained from light curve fitting .",
    "however , complete ignition of such a thick layer would give rise to more energetic bursts than observed , assuming the energy release expected for pure he burning .",
    "for the shortest @xmath3 burst ( b13 ) , using the average @xmath1 and @xmath2 during january 2011 ( 1.8@xmath1110@xmath35  erg  s@xmath36 and 0.9@xmath1110@xmath38  g  @xmath39  s@xmath36 , respectively ) yields a similarly high value of @xmath37  @xmath12506 .",
    "this indicates that even the shortest @xmath4 bursts in 4u  0614 + 09 are sub - energetic .",
    "thus after our improved @xmath4 measurements and considering bolometric / bandpass corrections to @xmath25 , the question of why are most bursts in 4u  0614 + 09 sub - energetic remains open .",
    "we also note that the shortest @xmath3 burst ( b13 ) has the lowest @xmath25 in our sample , as expected if the mass accumulated before ignition is also lowest .",
    "we found the period with the shortest @xmath4 near the minimum in @xmath2 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "this behavior is opposite to what ignition models predict and it might be due to different rates of stable h ( cno ) burning operating at slightly different @xmath2 ( although the apparent lack of h in the fuel makes this scenario unlikely ) . alternatively , it could reflect changes in the @xmath1-@xmath2 relation ( i.e. , in the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow ) unaccounted for . continued monitoring may determine whether this is a weeks - long fluctuation in the observed burst rate or it constitutes a systematic behavior of 4u  0614 + 09 .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : trecmdot ] , our gbm campaign in its first year has improved the accuracy of @xmath4 measurements at low @xmath2 , placing new constraints on models of low-@xmath2 ignition .",

    "* we quantify the bandpass effect on the observed burst duration and energy .",
    "we find that the total burst duration can be 1.555 times longer than that measured in the hard x - ray band , whereas this bolometric correction factor is 1.31.7 for burst energy ( which is therefore a more robust , band - independent observable ) . * the burst energies in 4u  0614 + 09 , between 8@xmath1110@xmath5  erg and 1@xmath1110@xmath7  erg after our bolometric correction",
