    "a review of some of these issues is given by d. strickland ( 2004 , these proceedings ) .",
    "one of the complicating factors in tackling the various facets of feedback is the vast range of physical scales that needs to be probed . while the relevant scales for charting star formation are those of the stars and star clusters ( a few pc ) , a study of the structure and conditions of the ism needs to sample scales of tens to hundreds of pc .",
    "moving on to larger scales , superwinds are best investigated on kpc scales , while probing the influence of global parameters involves scales of tens of kpc ( galactic sizes ) to mpc ( interactions ) .    even for the closest galaxies , the small  to  intermediate scales relevant for the interaction feedback ",
    "ism are accessible only via high angular resolution observations ( e.g. , with the hubble space telescope ) , as 10  pc=0.4@xmath1 for a galaxy at 5  mpc distance .",
    "the study reviewed here involves four local starburst galaxies observed with the wide field planetary camera  2 on the hst . because of their intense - to - extreme star formation rates , starburst galaxies are the sites where stellar feedback can have its most dramatic influence on the structure and evolution of the ism ( and surrounding igm ; @xcite ) , and are , therefore , optimal laboratories to investigate mechanical feedback .",
    "the four galaxies in the present study cover a range in luminosity , metallicity , star formation rate , and environment , but they are all closer than 5  mpc ( table  [ tab1 ] )",
    ". this investigation attempts at addressing the issue of the coupling feedback ",
    "ism , and its relation to the duration of the star forming event .",
    "the problem is tackled from two fronts : stellar populations and ism conditions .",
    "the ages of the young ( @xmath2300  myr ) stellar clusters are used to set a minimum value to the duration of the current starburst event , while measurements of the shocked gas provide a constraint on the fraction of starburst mechanical output that is recovered in the ism within a small distance ( @xmath21  kpc ) of the site of star formation .",

    "the star cluster populations and the spatial distributions of their ages within the starburst sites were investigated for three of the galaxies listed in table  [ tab1 ] , ngc3077 , ngc5236 , and ngc5253 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for ngc5253 , the diffuse starburst population had previously been age - dated ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which , combined with the more recent study of its cluster population , yields a complete picture of the recent star formation history in this galaxy .",
    "images of the galaxies in the hst / wfpc2 medium and broad filters uv , v , i , and in the h@xmath9 and h@xmath12 line emission provide enough angular resolution to identify clusters , and enough color information to age - date them .",
    "in particular , two age  sensitive diagnostics , the color  color diagram uv@xmath13v  versus  v@xmath13i and the equivalent width of h@xmath9 , were combined to constrain the most likely age for each stellar cluster and , assuming a salpeter imf , to assign a mass ( figure  [ fig1 ] ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "h@xmath9/h@xmath12 ratio maps were used to correct photometry and fluxes for the effects of dust reddening ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster ages were then re - mapped onto the galaxy images to derive the history of the cluster formation in each starburst .",
    "the two dwarf galaxies , ngc3077 and ngc5253 , show time ",
    "extended star formation , spanning the last 100300  myr , and a very ` chaotic ' spatial distribution of the cluster ages .",
    "this similarity between the two galaxies is counterbalanced by striking differences . in ngc3077 , there are star clusters as old as 300  myr , while in ngc5253 the oldest clusters unambiguously detected in the hst images do not seem to be significantly older than @xmath020  myr ( @xcite ) . indeed , the time ",
    "extended star formation history for ngc5253 is inferred not from its clusters , but from its diffuse stellar population , whose colors are consistent with constant star formation over the past @xmath0100 - 200  myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dearth of ` old ' star clusters in ngc5253 could be caused by rapid cluster dissolution timescales in the center of the galaxy ; by rescaling the milky way model of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite derive dissolution timescales in the range 1650  myr for ngc5253 .",
    "these short timescales are driven by the high central velocity dispersion measured in the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "a smaller velocity dispersion may be present in ngc3077 , as inferred from molecular cloud velocities ( @xcite ) , implying longer survival times for its clusters .",
    "contrary to the dwarfs , the distribution of the stellar clusters in the center of the giant spiral ngc5236 shows a high level of organization , possibly a reflection of the different dynamical environment ( presence of a bar ) in the massive galaxy .",
    "the uv  bright clusters are distributed along a half  ringlet surrounding the optically  bright nucleus .",
    "the distribution of the ages also shows a high level of correlation in the star formation , which appears propagating in the s ",
    "n direction and inside  out in the ringlet ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* harris et al . 2001 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a clear peak in the number of clusters in the narrow age range 57  myr , with a handful of older clusters ( up to @xmath050  myr ) .",
    "although the diffuse population is generally consistent with constant star formation over the past @xmath01  gyr , the sharp cut  off of the cluster ages around 7  myr could still be explained with either a recent starburst or very rapid cluster dissolution timescales ( @xcite ) .    independently of whether the current starburst in the grand design spiral is confirmed to be younger than @xmath010  myr , a clear mechanism for the triggering and feeding of the starburst , i.e. gas infall along the main bar , is present in ngc5236 ( @xcite ) .",
    "no such obvious mechanism is present in the two dwarf galaxies .",
    "their starbursts may have been triggered by past interactions with their companions ( m81 for ngc3077 , and ngc5236 for ngc5253 ) , but these interactions occurred a few hundred myr ago , and are unlikely to be the direct cause of the starbursts observed today .",
    "the stellar population study of these galaxies was complemented with the investigation of the conditions of the ism within and around the four starbursts .",
    "the standard emission line diagnostic diagram log([oiii]/h@xmath12)log([sii]/h@xmath9 ) was used to discriminate photoionized from non  photoionized gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "hst / wfpc2 images were obtained with narrow  band filters in correspondence of the forbidden lines [ oiii](5007   ) and [ sii](6726   ) , and of the hydrogen recombination lines h@xmath9 and h@xmath12 .",
    "the diagnostic diagram was constructed by dividing each image in a grid of bins 36  pc in size , measuring line fluxes in each bin 5  @xmath14 above the noise level , and deriving line ratios from spatially corresponding bins .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] ( left  panel ) gives an example of the resulting diagrams ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ` maximum starburst line ' defined by @xcite was used as the separating line between photoionized gas ( to the bottom  left of the line ) from non  photoionized gas ( to the top ",
    "right of the line , figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this can be considered a conservative definition of non  photoionized gas , yet it yielded clear identifications in all four galaxies .",
    "the non  photoionized gas in these galaxies shows two basic morphologies : enclosed bubbles and shells / filaments ( figure  [ fig2 ] , right panel ) , and is likely due to shock ionization ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the presence of star - formation - induced shocks is supported by observations of diffuse x  ray emission in the centers of all four galaxies . the shock ",
    "ionized component is responsible for a small fraction , about 3%4% , of the total h@xmath9 luminosity ( table  [ tab1 ] , column  7 ) , but is spread over a significant fraction of the area covered by the h@xmath9 emission , about 15%25% .    the availability of multi  color ( uv  to ",
    "i ) and h@xmath9 images allows us to place contraints on the characteristics of the ionizing stellar population , and , once coupled with models , on the expected amount of mechanical energy coming out of the starburst .",
    "the h@xmath9 luminosity predicted from the mechanical starburst output can then be compared with the _ observed _ h@xmath9 luminosity associated with shocks .",
    "the last column of table  [ tab1 ] shows the predicted - to - observed h@xmath9 luminosities from shocks , with the range marking starbursts of different durations , from 10  myr ( left - hand - side figure ) to 100  myr ( right - hand side figure ) . in this column , a figure smaller then 1 means that the starburst does not produce enough mechanical energy to account for the observed h@xmath9 luminosity of shocks , while a figure larger than 1 means the starburst can support the observed shock luminosity .    for the three dwarfs ,",
    "between 70% and 100% of the mechanical energy is deposited within the immediate surroundings of the starburst , roughly within the inner 0.21  kpc .",
    "furthermore , starbursts with durations shorter than @xmath030  myr do not produce enough mechanical energy to account for the observed h@xmath9 luminosity of shocks .",
    "it is worth reminding that we adopted a conservative criterion for identifying shocked gas in the galaxies , thus the limitation on the minimum duration of the starbursts is quite stringent .",
    "in addition , the result is independent of whether the parent galaxy is isolated or in interaction with other galaxies . since the vast majority of the starburst mechanical output is recovered in the immediate surroundings of the starburst itself , it is not unlikely that the shocks can trigger renewed star formation .",
    "this inference could help explain the long star formation timescales required by the high luminosity of the h@xmath9 emission associated with shocks , and the even longer timescales derived from the stellar population studies .",
    "for the giant spiral , only between 35% and 75% of the available mechanical output is recovered in the surrounding ism , for a variety of starburst conditions .",
    "thus , there are no restrictions on the current starburst coming from the characteristics of the shocked gas .",
    "in addition , the non  photoionized gas is located in two main bubbles , and there is a striking absence of extended features ( shells or filaments ) .",
    "this suggests a confined starburst .",
    "the characteristics of the stellar populations and ism in the starbursts of four nearby galaxies suggest a strong coupling between the starbursts and the surrounding ism .",
    "this is particularly true for the three dwarf galaxies in the sample . here",
    "the amount of observed h@xmath9 luminosity associated with shocks corresponds to about 70%100% of the total mechanical output from the starbursts , and places a lower limit of about 30  myr to the duration of the starbursts ( i.e. , these can not be ` bursts ' ) .",
    "such large fractions of mechanical energy available in the immediate surroundings of starbursts may suggest triggered star formation as a mechanism to explain the long duration timescales inferred from stellar population studies ( @xmath15100300  myr ) , in the absence of direct , recent triggers .",
