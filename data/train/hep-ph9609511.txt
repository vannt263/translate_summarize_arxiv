    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is one of the most compelling extensions of the standard model .",
    "it is the only known perturbative solution to the naturalness problem  @xcite , it unifies the gauge coupling constants for the observed value of @xmath12 , it allows radiative ew symmetry breaking , and the lightest susy partner provides a good dark matter candidate .",
    "susy models with such features are generally in excellent agreement with experiment , and there is even the possibility that a recent cdf event @xcite is of supersymmetric origin @xcite .",
    "one of the few phenomenological problems associated with susy models is their generically large predictions for the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron , @xmath1 .",
    "supersymmetric models with universal soft breaking parameters have two physical phases , beyond the ckm and strong phases of the sm , which can be taken to be the triscalar and biscalar soft breaking parameters @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "these phases give a large contribution to @xmath1 , of order @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a characteristic superpartner mass .",
    "the experimental upper bound on @xmath1 is of order @xmath15 @xcite , so that if superpartner masses are near the weak scale , the phases of these complex soft parameters must be fine - tuned to be less than or of order @xmath16@xmath17 since there is no _ a priori _ reason for them to be small @xcite .",
    "if one wants to avoid such a fine - tuning , there are two approaches : suppress @xmath1 with very large squark masses ( greater than a tev ) @xcite , or construct models in which the new susy phases naturally vanish @xcite .",
    "models with very heavy squarks are unappealing because in such models lsp annihilation is usually suppressed enough so that the relic density is unacceptably large @xcite .",
    "they also lead to a fine - tuning problem of their own in getting the @xmath18 boson mass to come out right in ew symmetry breaking .",
    "it is natural to consider solutions of the second type , and demand that the soft phases are zero by some symmetry .",
    "while that would leave only a small ckm contribution to @xmath1  @xcite , and thus avoid any fine - tuning in meeting the experimental bound on @xmath1 , it would also mean that there is no non - sm @xmath3 violation , which is needed by most schemes for electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "also , such models do not generate signals of non - sm @xmath3 violation , such as those involving top squark mixing .",
    "there are ways of naturally obtaining small nonzero soft phases which leave sufficient @xmath3 violation for baryogenesis @xcite , but these phases would still have to meet the bounds from @xmath1 and would probably be unobservably small in most ew processes  unless the soft terms are not universal .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that large non - sm @xmath3-violating top quark couplings could be probed at high energy colliders  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of a large top quark edm , for example , would indicate physics beyond the sm , and it is interesting to ask whether susy models can yield an observable effect .",
    "several references have attempted to use @xmath3 violation from top squark mixing due to the complex parameter @xmath0 to yield large @xmath3-violating effects in collider processes involving top quarks @xcite .",
    "such papers either explicitly or implicitly assume nonuniversal soft couplings @xmath19 at the gut scale ; otherwise , the phase of @xmath0 would be trivially constrained by @xmath1 .",
    "we consider whether it is possible to obtain large effects due to the phase of @xmath0 at the ew scale by relaxing the universality of @xmath9 .",
    "we will show that due to renormalization group induced effects on other low energy phases , the phase of @xmath0 is strongly constrained by @xmath1 , and it is not possible , for most areas of parameter space , to have large @xmath3-violating effects due to the imaginary part of @xmath0 .",
    "we will assume that no parameters are fine - tuned and thus we will require the phases at the gut scale to be either identically zero ( presumably through some symmetry ) or no less than @xmath20 .",
    "if one permits an arbitrary degree of fine - tuning , the whole susy @xmath3 violation issue becomes moot , and one can derive no constraints on the phase of @xmath0 . while one can construct models which give small universal phases , as we said above , the fine - tuning needed to evade the constraints we derive is unlikely to be explained naturally .",
    "our approach in this paper is to assume the reasonable fine - tuning criterion we have just outlined , and ask what it implies about low energy susy @xmath3-violating phenomenology .    in sec .",
    "ii , we review the basics of susy @xmath3 violation .",
    "we present our results derived from rges in sec .",
    "iii , and impose the neutron edm constraints on @xmath21 using those results in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v we discuss top squark mixing induced @xmath3 violating observables in more detail in light of our constraints on the phase of @xmath0 , and we give some concluding remarks in sec .",
    "vi . the details from sec .",

    "a common simplifying assumption is that this soft lagrangian arises as the result of a gut - scale supergravity ( sugra ) model with universal soft triscalar coupling @xmath9 , gaugino mass @xmath35 , and scalar mass @xmath36 .",
    "this provides an explanation for the absence of flavor changing neutral currents which arise from loops with squarks of nondegenerate mass  @xcite .",
    "such supersymmetric models have only two independent physical @xmath3-violating phases beyond the ckm and strong phases of the sm  @xcite although these phases appear in several different linear combinations in low energy phenomenology @xcite .",
    "we will take the two physical phases to be @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "it turns out that all @xmath3 violating vertices in this model arise through the diagonalization of complex mass matrices  @xcite .",
    "the complex quantities which appear in these matrices are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is @xmath42 ( the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values ) for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and where the phase of @xmath40 is simply equal to the phase of @xmath46 by a redefinition of fields .",
    "thus for @xmath1 , which involves only @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks , there are only contributions from three low energy combinations of the two susy gut phases : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",

    "even with universal boundary conditions , the elements of the matrices @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 have distinct phases at the ew scale because of renormalization group evolution .",
    "we will also relax , in some places , the assumption that their phases started the same at the gut scale .",
    "we assume ( for simplicity ) that these matrices are diagonal .",
    "one possible consequence of this approach is that one could have @xmath55 because @xmath56 and @xmath57 , but other @xmath19 , notably @xmath0 , could have large phases which lead to observable effects .",
    "these include angular correlations and polarizations @xcite , including effects attributable to the electric dipole moment of the top quark , @xmath58 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , this scenario is strongly constrained by rge running .",
    "the goal of this section is to demonstrate how a large phase in @xmath0 can feed into other parameters in the theory through renormalization group running .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath0 at the weak scale , @xmath59 , is determined by running @xmath60 ( and for large @xmath42 , @xmath61 ) down to the weak scale via the renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",

    "we will show that large @xmath63 induces potentially large values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which give an unacceptably large neutron electric dipole moment .    rather than write rges for the whole effective theory ,",
    "we need only consider a complete subset of them which includes @xmath19 and @xmath8 .",

    "it is generally estimated that the top quark edm ( @xmath58 ) can be measured to values as low as @xmath202  @xcite .",
    "given the constraints which we derived above , we ask if the minimal supersymmetric standard model can yield a value for @xmath58 this large .    in the context of supersymmetry , it has been proposed  @xcite that a large @xmath58 is possible if the phase of @xmath203 is of order one .",
    "but in sec .",
    "iii , we showed that @xmath204 is constrained to be smaller than or of order the phases which contribute to @xmath1 .",
    "the edm of the top is thus constrained to be less than a constant times the neutron edm : , [ dtdn ] where @xmath205 is the determinant of the ( down ) squark mass - squared matrix , and the value of @xmath206 depends upon many different susy parameters , but is generically of order 1 .",

    ".    we can turn this analysis around .",
    "if a large top quark edm is discovered , can it be explained in the mssm ?",
    "one possibility is that a conspiracy occurs between _ several _ large phases in the theory to render @xmath1 below experimental limits , yet produce a @xmath58 detectable at high energy colliders .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that all the @xmath209 coefficients which we absorbed into the parameter @xmath206 in eq .",
    "actually conspire to give @xmath210 . as we argued in the introduction",
    ", we would not view this as a likely explanation .    another possibility to consider",
    "is that the top squarks are much lighter than the other squarks . for @xmath58 to be observable , we would need the determinants in eq . to have a ratio @xmath211 .",
    "this is possible , but it too would require some fine - tuning .",
    "the large top - quark - induced running of the @xmath212 goes in the right direction  the lightest top squark mass eigenvalue tends to be smaller than the other quarks .",
    "however , @xmath213 generally tracks fairly well with the other squarks , @xmath214 , and thus , we estimate that , which means that we would need @xmath215 to yield an observable @xmath58 . if experiment determines that @xmath216 then this condition would imply that the superpartners of the light quarks are above @xmath217 .",
    "this is essentially the heavy squark  solution \" to the @xmath3 violation problem we mentioned in the introduction , with an additional fine - tuning implied by the small ratio @xmath218 .",
    "finally , one could appeal to differences between @xmath58 and @xmath219 due to effects proportional to @xmath220 , which are negligible in @xmath219 . to achieve @xmath206 of order @xmath221",
    ", one again needs a fine - tuned conspiracy of couplings .",
    "thus we conclude that if a large @xmath58 were found , one would probably have to look beyond the mssm for an explanation .",
    "it has long been noted that the phases of soft supersymmetric parameters generically lead to an unacceptably large neutron edm . this fine - tuning problem has slowly become less vexing as the theoretical expectations for the squark masses have risen faster than the experimental bound on the neutron edm",
    "has fallen . nevertheless , for squark masses below about a tev , we showed in sec .",
    "v that the phase of @xmath8 and universal phase of @xmath9 do not meet the fine - tuning criterion set forth in the introduction ( see fig 6c ) .",
    "certainly , if supersymmetry is discovered at lep 2 or tev 33 , a fundamental explanation for the absence of a neutron edm would be needed , and any scheme for baryogenesis at the ew scale would require that mechanism to leave small effective low energy phases in the soft terms @xcite .    from the phenomenological point of view , it is tempting to postulate that the soft phases are not universal  that the ew phase of @xmath0 is large , while the other phases which directly contribute to the neutron edm are small .",
    "this would allow interesting signatures of supersymmetric @xmath3 violation to be visible in top quark physics at future colliders .",
    "but we have demonstrated by using the renormalization group equations that the imaginary part of @xmath0 must be less than twice the imaginary part of @xmath8 , and @xmath0-induced cp - violating observables such as the top edm are thus expected to be unobservably small in almost all minimal susy models .",
    "these constraints are particularly important for models of ew baryogenesis which rely upon the phase of the stop lr mixing parameter , @xmath222 , to generate enough @xmath3 violation for baryogenesis .",
    "such models must also have sufficiently small @xmath223 to ensure that the phase transition is first order  @xcite .",
    "there has also been a recent attempt to explain the observed @xmath3 violation in the neutral kaon system with zero ckm phase and non - zero off - diagonal phases in the general @xmath9 matrices @xcite .",
    "if the universal diagonal @xmath9 parameter has a large phase at the gut scale , it will , as we noted above , give a large contribution to @xmath1 through a renormalization group induced phase in @xmath40 , as well as from a direct contribution .",
    "one could evade such bounds by insisting that the off - diagonal components of the @xmath9 matrices have a large phase , while the phases of the diagonal @xmath9 s and of @xmath8 vanish .",
    "although this hypothesis can probably be technically consistent with our fine - tuning criterion ( phases either zero or large ) , this scenario strikes us as unnatural",
