    "in 1967 , oppenheim ( see @xcite ) asked the following question : given @xmath1 points in the plane and @xmath11 , how many triangles spanned by the points can have area @xmath7 ? by applying a scaling transformation ,",
    "one may assume @xmath12 and count the triangles of _ unit _ area .",
    "erds and purdy  @xcite showed that a @xmath13 section of the integer lattice determines @xmath14 triangles of the same area .",
    "they also showed that the maximum number of such triangles is at most @xmath15 . in 1992 , pach and sharir  @xcite improved the bound to @xmath16 , using the szemerdi - trotter theorem  @xcite ( see below ) on the number of point - line incidences .",

    "@xcite have obtained the upper bound @xmath18 , for any @xmath19 , which has been slightly improved to @xmath3 in apfelbaum  @xcite .",
    "this has been the best known upper bound so far .    in this paper",
    "we further improve the bound to @xmath2 .",
    "our proof uses a different reduction of the problem to an incidence problem , this time to incidences between points and two - dimensional algebraic surfaces in @xmath20 .",
    "a very recent result of solymosi and de zeeuw  @xcite provides a sharp upper bound for the number of such incidences , similar to the szemerdi ",
    "trotter bound , provided that the points , surfaces , and incidences satisfy certain fairly restrictive assumptions .",
    "the main novel features of our analysis are thus ( a ) the reduction of the problem to this specific type of incidence counting , and ( b ) showing that the assumptions of @xcite are satisfied in our context .    after establishing this main result , we consider two variations , in which better bounds can be obtained .",
    "we first consider the case where the input points lie on three arbitrary lines .",
    "it is easily checked that in this case there are at most @xmath5 unit - area triangles .",
