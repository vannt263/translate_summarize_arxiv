    "nearly 400 extrasolar planets have now been discovered using the radial velocity ( rv ) method .",
    "rv surveys currently have good statistical completeness only for planets with periods of less than ten years @xcite , due to the limited temporal baseline of the observations , and the need to observe for a complete orbital period to confirm the properties of a planet with confidence .",
    "the masses of discovered planets range from just a few earth masses @xcite up to around 20 jupiter masses ( m@xmath10 ) .",
    "we note that a 20 m@xmath10  object would be considered by many to be a brown dwarf rather than a planet , but that there is no broad consensus on how to define the upper mass limit for planets . for a good overview of rv planets to date , see @xcite or http://exoplanet.eu/catalog-rv.php .",
    "the large number of rv planets makes it possible to examine the statistics of extrasolar planet populations .",
    "several groups have fit approximate power law distributions in mass and semimajor axis to the set of known extrasolar planets ( see for example @xcite ) . necessarily , however , these power laws are not subject to observational constraints at orbital periods longer than 10 years  and it is at these orbital periods that we find giant planets in our own solar system .",
    "we can not obtain a good understanding of planets in general without information on long period extrasolar planets . nor",
    "can we see how our own solar system fits into the big picture of planet formation in the galaxy without a good census of planets in jupiter- and saturn - like orbits around other stars .",
    "repeatable detections of extrasolar planets ( as opposed to one - time microlensing detections ) have so far been made by transit detection ( e.g. @xcite ) , by rv variations @xcite , by astrometric wobble @xcite , or by direct imaging @xcite .",
    "of these methods , transits are efficient only for detecting close - in planets .",
    "as noted above , precision rv observations have not been going on long enough to detect more than a few planets with periods longer than ten years , but even as rv temporal baselines increase , long period planets will remain harder to detect due to their slow orbital velocities .",
    "the amplitude of a star s astrometric wobble increases with the radius of its planet s orbit , but decades - long observing programs are still needed to find long - period planets .",
    "direct imaging is the only method that allows us to characterize long - period extrasolar planets on a timescale of months rather than years or decades .",
    "direct imaging of extrasolar planets is technologically possible at present only in the infrared , based on the planets own thermal luminosity , not on reflected starlight .",
    "the enabling technology is adaptive optics ( ao ) , which allows 6 - 10 m ground - based telescopes to obtain diffraction limited ir images several times sharper than those from hst , despite earth s turbulent atmosphere .",
    "theoretical models of giant planets indicate that such telescopes should be capable of detecting self - luminous giant planets in large orbits around young , nearby stars .",
    "the stars should be young because the glow of giant planets comes from gravitational potential energy converted to heat in their formation and subsequent contraction : lacking any internal fusion , they cool and become fainter as they age .    several groups have published the results of ao imaging surveys for extrasolar planets around f , g , k , or m stars in the last five years ( see for example @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "of these , most have used wavelengths in the 1.5 - 2.2 @xmath11 m range , corresponding to the astronomical @xmath12 and @xmath13 filters @xcite .",
    "they have targeted mainly very young stars .",
    "because young stars are rare , the median distance to stars in each of these surveys has been more than 20 pc .",
    "in contrast to those above , our survey concentrates on very nearby f , g , and k stars , with proximity prioritized more than youth in the sample selection .",
    "the median distance to our survey targets is only 11.2 pc .",
    "ours is also the first survey to include extensive observations in the @xmath1 band , and only the second to search solar - type stars in the @xmath0 band ( the first was @xcite ) .",
    "the distinctive focus on older , very nearby stars for a survey using longer wavelengths is natural : longer wavelengths are optimal for lower temperature planets which are most likely to be found in older systems , but which would be undetectable around all but the nearest stars . more information on our sample selection , observations , and data analysis can be found in our observations paper , @xcite , which also details our careful evaluation of our survey s sensitivity , including extensive tests in which fake planets were randomly placed in the raw data and then recovered by an experimenter who knew neither their positions nor their number .",
    "such tests are essential for establishing the true relationship between source significance ( i.e. 5@xmath14 , 10@xmath14 , etc . ) and survey completeness .",
    "our survey places constraints on a more mature population of planets than those that have focused on very young stars , and confirms that a paucity of giant planets at large separations from sun - like stars is robustly observed at a wide range of wavelengths .    in section [ sec : rv ]",
    ", we review power law fits to the distribution of known rv planets , including the normalization of the power laws . in section [ sec : tmod ] , we present the constraints our survey places on the distribution of extrasolar giant planets , based on extensive monte carlo simulations . in section [ sec : long ] we discuss the promising future of planet - search observations in the @xmath0 and especially the @xmath1 band , and in section [ sec : concl ] we conclude .",
    "nearly 400 rv planets are known .",
    "see @xcite for a useful , conservative listing of confirmed extrasolar planets as of 2006 , or http://exoplanet.eu/catalog-rv.php for a frequently - updated catalog of all confirmed and many suspected extrasolar planet discoveries .",
    "the number of rv planets is sufficient for meaningful statistical analysis of how extrasolar planets are distributed in terms of their masses and orbital semimajor axes .",
    "the lowest mass planets and those with the longest orbital periods are generally rejected from such analyses to reduce bias from completeness effects , but there remains a considerable range ( 2 - 2000 days in period , or roughly 0.03 - 3.1 au in semimajor axis for solar - type stars ; and 0.3 - 20 m@xmath10  in mass ) where rv searches have good completeness @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that the shortest period planets , or ` hot jupiters , ' represent a separate population , a ` pileup ' of planets in very close - in orbits that does not follow the same statistical distribution as planets in more distant orbits @xcite .",
    "the hot jupiters are therefore often excluded from statistical fits to the overall populations of extrasolar planets , or at least from the fits to the semimajor axis distribution .",
    "@xcite characterize the distribution of rv planets detected in the keck planet search with an equation of the form    @xmath15    where @xmath1 is the mass of the planet , @xmath16 is the orbital period , and @xmath17 is a normalization constant .",
    "they state that 10.5% of solar - type stars have a planet with mass between 0.3 and 10 m@xmath10  and period between 2 and 2000 days , which information can be used to derive a value for @xmath17 given values for the power law exponents @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "they find that the best - fit values for these are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where the @xmath22 subscript is our notation to make clear that these are the exponents for the form using logarithmic differentials .    in common with a number of other groups , we choose to represent the power law with ordinary differentials , and to give it in terms of orbital semimajor axis @xmath4 rather than orbital period @xmath16 :    @xmath23    where @xmath17 , of course , will not generally have the same value for equations [ eq : cumming ] and [ eq : uspower ] .",
    "manipulating the two equations and using kepler s third law makes it clear that    @xmath24    and    @xmath25    the @xcite exponents produce @xmath26 and @xmath27 when translated into our form .",
    "the mass power law is well behaved , but the integral of the semimajor axis power law does not converge as @xmath28 , so an outer truncation radius is an important parameter of the semimajor axis distribution .",
    "@xcite presents the 2006 catalog of nearby exoplanets , a carefully described heterogenous sample of planets detected by several different rv search programs . with appropriate caution ,",
    "@xcite refrain from quoting confident power law slopes based on the combined discoveries of many different surveys with different detection limits and completeness biases ( in contrast , the @xcite analysis was restricted to stars in the keck planet search , which were uniformly observed up to a given minimum baseline and velocity precision ) .",
    "@xcite do tentatively adopt a power law with the form of equation [ eq : uspower ] for mass only , and state that @xmath8 appears to be about -1.1 ( or -1.16 , to give the exact result of a formal fit to their list of exoplanets ) .",
    "however they caution that due to their heterogeneous list of planets discovered by different surveys , this power law should be taken more as a descriptor of the known planets than of the underlying distribution .",
    "they do not quote a value for the semimajor axis power law slope @xmath9 .",
    "based mostly on @xcite , but considering @xcite as helpful additional input , we conclude that the true value of the mass power law slope @xmath8 is probably between -1.1 and -1.51 , with -1.31 as a good working model . the value of the semimajor axis power law slope @xmath9 is probably between -0.46 and -0.76 , with -0.61 as a current best guess .",
    "the outer truncation radius of the semimajor axis distribution can not be constrained by the rv results : surveys like ours exist , in part , to constrain this interesting number .    the only other result we need from the rv searches is a normalization that will allow us to find @xmath17 .",
    "we elect not to use the @xcite value ( 10.5% of stars having a planet with mass between 0.3 and 10 m@xmath10  and period between 2 and 2000 days ) , because this range includes the hot jupiters , a separate population .",
    "we take our normalization instead from the carnegie planet sample , as described in @xcite .",
    "their table 1 ( online only ) lists 850 stars that have been thoroughly investigated with rv .",
    "they state that all planets with mass at least 1 m@xmath10  and orbital period less than 4 years have been detected around these stars .",
    "forty - seven of these stars are marked in table 1 as having rv planets .",
    "table 2 from @xcite gives the measured properties of 124 rv planets , including those orbiting 45 of the 47 stars listed as planet - bearing in table 1 .",
    "the stars left out are hd 18445 and and hd 225261",
    ". we can not find any record of these stars having planets , and therefore as far as we can tell they are typos in table 1 .",
    "since all planets with masses above 1 m@xmath10  and periods less than 4 years orbiting stars in the @xcite list of 850 may be relied upon to have been discovered , we may pick any sub - intervals in this range of mass and period , and divide the number of planets falling into these intervals by 850 to obtain our normalization .",
    "we selected the range 1 - 13 m@xmath10  in mass , and 0.3 - 2.5 au in semimajor axis .",
    "twenty - eight stars , or 3.29% of the 850 in the @xcite list , have one or more planets in this range .",
    "our inner limit of 0.3 au excludes the hot jupiters , and thus the 3.29% value provides our final normalization .",
    "we note that if we adopt the @xcite best - fit power laws , and use the 3.29% normalization to predict the percentage of stars having planets with masses between 0.3 and 10 m@xmath10  and orbital periods between 2 and 2000 days , we find a value of 9.3% , which is close to the @xcite value of 10.5% .",
    "the slight difference is probably not significant , but might be viewed as upward bias in the @xcite value due to the inclusion of the hot jupiters . in any case we would not have obtained very different constraints if we had used the @xcite normalization in our monte carlo simulations .    for comparison , among the other papers reporting monte carlo simulations similar to ours",
    ", @xcite used a normalization of 3% for planets with semimajor axes of 1 - 3 au and masses greater than 1 m@xmath10 .",
    "this is close to our value of 3.29% for a similar range . @xcite and @xcite fixed @xmath8 and @xmath9 in their simulations , and",
    "let the normalization be a free parameter .",
    "@xcite obtained their normalization from @xcite , and @xcite obtained theirs from @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide a helpful mathematical description of the eccentricity distribution of known rv planets :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the probability of a given extrasolar planet s having orbital eccentricity @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the root of the natural logarithm , and @xmath33 .",
    "we find that this mathematical form provides an excellent fit to the distribution of real exoplanet eccentricities from table 2 of @xcite , so we have used it as our probability distribution to generate random eccentricities for the monte carlo simulations we describe in section [ sec : tmod ] below .",
    "@xcite present high resolution , flux - calibrated theoretical spectra of giant planets or brown dwarfs for ages ranging from 0.1 - 5.0 gyr and masses from 1 to 20 m@xmath10  ( these are available for download from http://www.astro.princeton.edu/\\textasciitilde burrows/[http://www.astro.princeton.edu/\\textasciitilde burrows/ ] ) .",
    "we have integrated these spectra to give absolute magnitudes in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters used in clio ( see tables [ tab : burl ] and [ tab : burm ] ) , and have found that the results can be reasonably interpolated to give the @xmath0 or @xmath1 band magnitudes for all planets of interest for our survey .",
    "@xcite also present models of giant planets and brown dwarfs , pre - integrated into magnitudes in the popular infrared bands .",
    "these models predict slightly better sensitivity to low mass planets in the @xmath0 band and slightly poorer sensitivity in the @xmath1 band , relative to the @xcite models .",
    "we can not say if the difference is due to the slightly different filter sets used ( mko for clio vs. johnson - glass and johnson for @xcite ) , or if it is intrinsic to the different model spectra used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have chosen to use the @xcite models exclusively herein , to avoid any errors due to the slight filter differences .",
    "since the @xcite models predict poorer sensitivity in the @xmath0 band , in which the majority of our survey was conducted , our decision to use them is conservative .",

    "various features of our images could cause the sensitivity at a given separation to vary somewhat with position angle : to quantify this , our tabular files give ten different values at each separation , corresponding to ten different percentiles ranging from the worst to the best sensitivity attained at that separation .",
    "these files are described in detail in @xcite , and are available for download from http://www.hopewriter.com/astronomyfiles/data/surveypaper/    the monte carlo simulations described below allow us to use the observed sensitivity to planets in our survey to calculate directly the probability of a given parameter or set of parameters describing the exoplanet population .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to constrain these parameters at a given confidence level .",
    "this is a maximum likelihood technique that allows us to incorporate all the individual probability functions of the data , as well as parameterized models of the exoplanet population .",
    "the approach is similar to a bayesian approach .",
    "however , we also use the results of the simulations to set confidence limits to the parameters , a more classical approach .",
    "each monte carlo simulation runs with given planet distribution power law slopes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and a given outer truncation value @xmath34 for the semimajor axis distribution . using the normalization described in section [ sec : rv ] , the probability @xmath35 of any given star having a planet between 1 and 20 m@xmath10",
    "is then calculated from the input @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath34 . in each realization of our survey ,",
    "each star is randomly assigned a number of planets , based on poisson statistics with mean @xmath35 . in most cases @xmath36 , so the most likely number of planets is zero .",
    "if the star turns out to have one or more planets , the mass and semimajor axis of each are randomly selected from the input power law distributions .",
    "the eccentricity is randomly selected from the @xcite distribution , and an inclination is randomly selected from the distribution @xmath37 . if the star is a binary , the planet may be dropped from the simulation at this point if the orbit seems likely to be unstable .",
    "in general , we consider circumstellar planets to be stable as long as their apastron distance is less than @xmath38 the projected distance to the companion star , and circumbinary planets to be stable as long as their periastron distance is at least three times greater than the projected separation of the binary . for planets orbiting low - mass secondaries , a smaller limit on the apastron distance",
    "is sometimes imposed , while often circumbinary planets required such distant orbits that they were simply not considered ; the details are given in table [ tab : binaries ] . for each planet passing the orbital stability checkpoint , a full orbit is calculated using a binary star code written by one of us ( m. k. )",
    ". the projected separation in arcseconds is found , and the magnitude of the planet is calculated from its mass , distance , and age using the @xcite models .",
    "two further random choices complete the determination of whether the simulated planet is detected .",
    "first , one of the ten percentiles given in the sensitivity files is randomly selected .",
    "combined with the separation in arcseconds , this selection specifies the sensitivity of our observation at the location of the simulated planet .",
    "the second random choice is needed because planets appearing at low significance in our images would have a less than 100% chance of being confidently detected .",
    "our blind sensitivity tests using fake planets placed in our raw data showed that we could confirm 97% of 10@xmath14 sources , 46% of 7@xmath14 sources , and 16% of 5@xmath14 sources , where @xmath14 is a measure of the psf - scale noise in a given region of the image ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this second and final random choice in our monte carlo simulations is therefore arranged to ensure that a randomly selected 16% of planets with 5 - 7@xmath14 significance , and 46% of planets with 7 - 10@xmath14 significance , are recorded in the simulation as detected objects .",
    "although we have 97% completeness at 10@xmath14 , we choose to consider 100% of simulated planets with 10@xmath14 or greater significance to be detected , because at only slightly above 10@xmath14 the true completeness certainly becomes 100% for all practical purposes .",
    "note that we have conservatively allowed the detection probabilities to increase stepwise , rather than in a continuous curve , from 5 to 10@xmath14 : that is , in our monte carlo simulations , planets with 5 - 7@xmath14 significance are detected at the 5@xmath14 rate from our blind sensitivity tests , while those with 7 - 10@xmath14 significance are detected at the 7@xmath14 rate .",
    "the low completeness ( 16% ) at 5@xmath14 , as determined from our blind sensitivity tests using fake planets , may seem surprising . in these tests we distinguished between planets that were suggested by a concentration of unusually bright pixels ( ` noticed ' ) , or else confidently identified as real sources ( ` confirmed ' ) .",
    "many more planets were noticed than were confirmed : for noticed planets , the rates are 100% at 10@xmath14 , 86% at 7@xmath14 , and 56% at 5@xmath14 .",
    "however , very many false positives were also noticed , so sources that are merely noticed but not confirmed do not represent usable detections .",
    "the completeness levels we used in our monte carlo simulations ( 16% at 5@xmath14 and 46% at 7@xmath14 ) refer to confirmed sources .",
    "no false positives were confirmed in any of our blind tests .",
    "followup observations of suspected sources are costly in terms of telescope time , so a detection strategy with a low false - positive rate is important .",
    "though sensitivity estimators ( and therefore the exact meaning of 5@xmath14 ) differ among planet imaging surveys , ours was quite conservative , as is explained in @xcite .",
    "the low completeness we find at 5@xmath14 , which has often been taken as a high - completeness sensitivity limit , should serve as a warning to future workers in this field , and an encouragement to establish a definitive significance - completeness relation through blind sensitivity tests as we have done .",
    "note that our blind sensitivity tests , covered in @xcite , are completely distinct from the monte carlo simulations covered herein .",
    "the blind tests involved inserting a little over a hundred fake planets into our raw image data to establish our point - source sensitivity . in our monte carlo work we simulated the orbits , masses , and brightnesses of millions of planets , and compared them to our previously - established sensitivity limits to see which planets our survey could have detected .      to evaluate the significance of our survey and provide some guidance for future work , we have analyzed in detail a single monte carlo simulation .",
    "we chose the @xcite best fit values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with the semimajor axis truncation radius set to 100 au .",
    "planets could range in mass from 1 to 20 m@xmath10 . as described in section",
    "[ sec : rv ] above , we normalized the planet distributions so that each star had a 3.29% probability of having a planet with semimajor axis between 0.3 and 2.5 au and mass between 1 and 13 m@xmath10 .",
    "the simulation consisted of 50,000 realizations of our survey with these parameters .",
    "in all , 505,884 planets were simulated , of which 51,879 were detected .    in 38% of the 50,000 realizations , our survey found zero planets , while 37% of the time it found one , and 25% of the time it found two or more .",
    "the planet distribution we considered in this simulation can not be ruled out by our survey , since a null result such as we actually obtained turns out not to be very improbable .",
    "the large number of survey realizations in our simulation allows the calculation of precise statistics for potentially detectable planets .",
    "the median mass of detected planets in our simulation was 11.36 m@xmath10 , the median semimajor axis was 43.5 au , the median angular separation was 2.86 arcsec , and the median significance was 21.4@xmath14 . this last number is interesting because it suggests that , for our survey , any real planet detected was likely to appear at high significance , obvious even on a preliminary , ` quick - look ' reduction of the data .",
    "this suggests that performing such reductions at the telescope should be a high priority , to allow immediate confirmation and followup if a candidate is seen .",
    "figure [ fig : sighist ] presents as a histogram the significance of all planets detected in this monte carlo simulation .",
    "we suspected that there would be a detection bias toward very eccentric planets , because these would spend most of their orbits near apastron , where they would be easier to detect .",
    "this bias did not appear at any measurable level in our simulation .",
    "however , there was a weak but clear bias toward planets in low - inclination orbits , which , of course , spend more of their time at large separations from their stars than do planets with nearly edge - on orbits .",
    "a concern with any planet imaging survey is how strongly the results hinge on the best ( i.e. nearest and youngest ) few stars . a survey of 54 stars may have far less statistical power than the number would imply if the best two or three stars had most of the probabilty of hosting detectable planets .",
    "table [ tab : sdp ] gives the percentage of planets detected around each star in our sample based on our detailed monte carlo simulation .",
    "due to poor data quality , binary orbit constraints , or other issues , a few stars had zero probability of detected planets given the distribution used here .",
    "in general , however , the likelihood of hosting detectable planets is fairly well distributed .    in table [ tab : binaries ] , we give the details of planetary orbital constraints used in our monte carlo simulations for each binary star we observed , complete with the separations we measured for the binaries .",
    "note that hd 96064 b is a close binary star in its own right , so planets orbiting it were limited in two ways : the apastron could not be too far out , or the orbit would be rendered unstable by proximity to hd 96064 a  but the periastron also could not be too far in , or the binary orbit of hd 96064 ba and hd 96064 bb would render it unstable .",
    "planets individually orbiting hd 96064 ba or hd 96064 bb were not considered in our survey , since to be stable the planets would have to be far too close - in for us to detect them .",
    "the constraints described in table [ tab : binaries ] account for most of the stars in table [ tab : sdp ] with few or no detections reported .",

    "the latter are our only means of converting from planetary mass and age to detectable flux , and as such they remain indispensable .",
    "to place our model - independent constraints , we performed an additional series of monte carlo simulations on a grid of planet mass and orbital semimajor axis . for each grid point",
    "we seek to determine a number @xmath52 such that , with some specified level of confidence ( e.g. , 90% ) , the probability of a star like those in our sample having a planet with the specified mass @xmath1 and semimajor axis @xmath4 is no more than @xmath52 .",
    "we determine @xmath52 by a search : first a guess is made , and a monte carlo simulation assuming this probability is performed .",
    "if more than 10% of the realizations of our survey turn up a null result , the guessed probability is too low ; if less than 10% turn up a null result , the probability is too high .",
    "it is adjusted in steps of ever - decreasing size until the correct value is reached .",
    "figure [ fig : bmcgrid1 ] shows the 90% confidence upper limit on @xmath52 as a function of mass @xmath1 and semimajor axis @xmath4 .",

    "for example , with 90% confidence we find that less than 50% of stars with properties like those in our survey have a 5 m@xmath10  or more massive planet in an orbit with a semimajor axis between 30 and 94 au .",
    "less than 25% of stars like those in our survey have a 7 m@xmath10  or more massive planet between 25 and 100 au , less than 15% have a 10 m@xmath10  or more massive planet between 22 and 100 au , and less than 12% have a 15 m@xmath10  or more massive planet / brown dwarf between 15 and 100 au .",
    "going to the most massive objects considered in our simulations , we can set limits ranging inward past 10 au : we find that less than 25% of stars like those surveyed have a 20 m@xmath10  object orbiting between 8 and 100 au .",
    "these constraints hold independently of how planets are distributed in terms of their masses and semimajor axes .     that a star like those in our survey will have a planet of mass @xmath1 and semimajor axis @xmath4 .",
    "this plot shows , for example , that our survey constrains the abundance of 10 m@xmath10  or more massive planets with orbital semimajor axes between 22 and 100 au to be less than 15% around sun - like stars .",
    "the abundance of 5 m@xmath10  or more massive planets between 25 and 94 au is constrained to be less than 50% .",
    "the latter range does not extend all the way to 100 au because our sensitivity to planets in very distant orbits decreases somewhat due to the possibility of their lying beyond our field of view .",
    "[ fig : bmcgrid1 ] ]    hr 8799 appears to have a remarkable system of three massive planets , seen at projected distances of 24 , 38 , and 68 au , with masses of roughly 10 , 10 , and 7 m@xmath10 , respectively @xcite . using a monte carlo simulation like those used to create figure [ fig : bmcgrid1 ]",
    ", we find with 90% confidence that less than 8.1% of stars like those in our survey have a clone of the hr 8799 planetary system . for purposes of this simulation we adopted the masses above , and set the planets orbital radii equal to their projected separations .",
    "our 8.1% limit represents a step toward determining whether or not systems of massive planets in wide orbits are more common around more massive stars such as hr 8799 than fgk stars such as those we have surveyed .",
    "the surveys of @xcite and @xcite , have set constraints on the distributions of extrasolar planets similar to those we present herein , while @xcite and especially @xcite have set stronger constraints .",
    "more recent analyses by @xcite and @xcite also provide constraints on the planetary distribution .",
    "for example , @xcite provide a 68% confidence that the @xcite distribution can be excluded for a truncation radius of 28 au .",
    "however , if different models are used this number jumps to 83 au .",
    "chauvin et al .",
    "indicate a similar limit from analyzing their results using baraffe et al .",
    "2003 models . for the standard parameters they indicate a maximum permitted truncation radius of approximately 35 au . in this context , the results presented here provide looser constraints on the planet distribution , but provide an independent check on the model - dependent systematic errors which may exist with shorter wavelength data , due to incorrect model brightness estimates or age determination .",
    "theoretical spectra of self - luminous extrasolar planets are very poorly constrained observationally .",
    "the recent detections of possible planets around hr 8799 @xcite , fomalhaut @xcite , and @xmath9 pic @xcite are either single - band ( @xmath9 pic ) or only beginning to be evaluated at multiple wavelengths ( hr 8799 , fomalhaut ) . the candidate planets orbiting hr 8799 and @xmath9 pic are hotter than we would expect to find orbiting middle - aged stars such as those in our survey , while hst photometry of fomalhaut b suggests much of its brightness is starlight reflected from a circumplanetary dust disk . our survey , and other exoplanet surveys , must therefore be interpreted using models of planetary spectra that are not yet well - tested against observations .",
    "such models predict brightnesses in the @xmath12 band , and particularly in narrow spectral windows within the @xmath12 band , that are enormously in excess of black body fluxes .",
    "the constraints set by @xcite ; and @xcite depend on the accuracy of these predictions of remarkable brightness in the @xmath12 band .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands that we have used are nearer the blackbody peaks of low - temperature self - luminous planets , and might be expected to be more reliable .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite suggest that the @xmath1 band brightness at least of hotter extrasolar planets will be less than predicted by @xcite due to above - equilibrium concentrations of co from convective mixing .",
    "@xcite present new models indicating the effect is present for planets with @xmath53  ranging from 600 to 1800k .",
    "the maximum @xmath1 band flux supression is about 40% , and flux supression disappears completely for @xmath53  below 500k .",
    "based on @xcite , this @xmath53  value corresponds to planets of about 3.5 , 6.5 , 12 , and 15 m@xmath10  at ages of 100 myr , 300 myr , 1 gyr , and 2 gyr , respectively . in many cases our @xmath1 band observations were sensitive to planets at lower masses than these values , and",
    "therefore @xmath53  lower than 500k , implying that the co flux supression would have no effect on our mass limits . in other cases",
    "our @xmath1 band sensitivity did not extend so low .",
    "however , given that @xmath1 band observations formed a relatively small part of our survey , and co supression would affect only a fraction even of them , the total effect on the statistical conclusions of our survey should be entirely negligible .",
    "theoretical spectra such as those of @xcite may or may not be more reliable in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "however , so long as the models remain poorly constrained by observations at every wavelength , conclusions based on observations at multiple wavelengths will be more secure",
    ". our survey , with that of @xcite , has diversified planet imaging surveys across a broader range of wavelengths .    in another sense",
    "our survey differs even from that of @xcite : we have investigated older stars .",
    "this is significant because planetary systems up to ages of several hundred myr may still be undergoing substantial dynamical evolution due to planet - planet interactions @xcite .",
    "our survey did not necessarily probe the same planet population as , for example , those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , theoretical models of older planets are likely more reliable than for younger ones , as these planets are further from their unknown starting conditions and moving toward a well - understood , stable configuration such as that of jupiter .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite and @xcite that theoretical planet models such as those of @xcite and @xcite may overpredict the brightness of young ( @xmath43 100 myr ) planets by orders of magnitude , while for older planets the models are more accurate .",
    "we have focused on nearby , mature star systems , and have conservatively handled the ages of stars .",
    "this makes our survey uniquely able to confirm that the rarity of giant planets at large separations around solar - type stars , first noticed in surveys strongly weighted toward young stars , persists at older system ages .",
    "it is not an artifact of model inaccuracy at young ages due to unknown initial conditions .",
    "in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , the sky brightness is much worse than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "however , models ( e.g. , @xcite ) predict that in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , planets fade less severely with increasing age ( or , equivalently , decreasing @xmath53 ) .",
    "also , planet / star flux ratios are more favorable in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands than at shorter wavelengths such as the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands .",
    "it makes sense to use the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands on bright stars , where the planet / star flux ratio is a more limiting factor than the sky brightness . in @xcite",
    ", we have shown that @xmath1 band observations tend to do better than those at shorter wavelengths at small separations from bright stars .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands are most useful , however , for detecting the lowest temperature planets , which have the reddest @xmath2 and @xmath3 colors .",
    "such very low temperature planets can only be detected around the nearest stars , so it is for very nearby stars that @xmath0 and @xmath1 band observations are most useful .",
    "for distant stars , around which only relativly high @xmath53  planets can be detected , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands are much better .",
    "we will now quantitatively describe the advantage of @xmath0 and @xmath1 band observations over shorter wavelengths for planet - search observations of nearby stars .",
    "most ao planet searches to date have used the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands , or specialized filters in the same wavelength regime .",
    "while the @xmath13 band has been used extensively to search for planets around young stars @xcite , our comparison here will focus on the @xmath12 band regime .",
    "models indicate it offers better sensitivity than the @xmath13 band except for planets younger than 100 myr @xcite , and most of the stars we will suggest the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 bands are useful for will be older than this .",
    "the most sensitive @xmath12-regime planet search observations made to date are those of @xcite , in part because of their optimized narrow - band filter .",
    "they attained an effective background - limited point - source sensitivity of about @xmath54 .",
    "based on the models of @xcite , @xcite would have set better planetary mass limits than our observations around all of our own survey targets except the very nearest objects , such as @xmath31 eri and 61 cyg .",
    "thus , at present , the @xmath12-regime delivers far better planet detection prospects than the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands for most stars",
    ".    however , as detector technology improves , larger telescopes are built , and longer planet detection exposures are attempted , the sensitivity at all wavelengths will increase .",
    "this means that low - temperature planets , with their red ir colors , will be detectable at larger distances , and the utility of the @xmath0 and especially the @xmath1 bands will increase . in figure [",
    "fig : hlm1 ] we show the minimum detectable planet mass for hypothetical stars at 10 and 25 pc distance as a function of the increase over current sensitivity in the @xmath12 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 bands , and in figure [ fig : hlm2 ] we present the same comparison for a star at 5 pc .",
    "we have taken current sensitivity to be @xmath55 ( i.e. , @xcite ) , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ( i.e. , the present work , scaled to an 8 m telescope such as @xcite used ) .",
    "these are background limits , not applicable close to bright stars . based on @xcite",
    ", we believe the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands will do even better relative to @xmath12 closer to the star where observations are no longer background limited .",
    "of course @xmath12 band observations with next - generation extreme ao systems such as gpi and sphere will offer improved performance close to the star , but advances in @xmath1-band ao coronography ( e.g. @xcite ) , will also improve the longer - wavelength results . in any case",
    ", figures [ fig : hlm1 ] and [ fig : hlm2 ] compare background - limited performance only",
    ".    the supression of flux in the @xmath1 band due to elevated levels of co @xcite does not apply to planets at the low temperatures relevant for figures [ fig : hlm1 ] and [ fig : hlm2 ] .",
    "based on @xcite , the entire mass range covered by both figures corresponds to planets with @xmath53  below 500k , except for planets with masses above 6.5 m@xmath10  in the left panel of figure [ fig : hlm1 ] ( 25 pc distance , 300 myr age ) .",
    "this upper section of the 25 pc , 300 myr panel is irrelevant to the important implications of the figure .",
    "according to @xcite , there is no supression of the @xmath1 band for effective temperatures below 500k .",
    "we have deliberately chosen the characteristics of the hypothetical stars in figures [ fig : hlm1 ] and [ fig : hlm2 ] to be less good than the best available planet search candidates , so that in each case stars closer and/or younger than the example actually exist . using the very youngest stars",
    "would also have resulted in sensitivities better than 1 m@xmath10 , a mass regime not covered by the @xcite models used in the figures .",
    "figures [ fig : hlm1 ] and [ fig : hlm2 ] illustrate three very important points .",
    "first , the @xmath0 band appears to have only secondary usefulness since either the @xmath12 band or the @xmath1 band always offers sensitivity to lower - mass planets .",
    "second , figure [ fig : hlm2 ] shows that with a relatively minor increase of 1 magnitude in sensitivity , the @xmath1 band will be sensitive to lower - mass planets around all stars within 5 pc than can be detected with @xmath12 band observations , even if the @xmath12 band sensitivity increases the same amount .",
    "third , figure [ fig : hlm1 ] shows that the advantage of the @xmath1 band decreases with increasing distance , but that as larger telescopes and longer exposures increase sensitivities to 2.5 mag above present levels , the @xmath1 band will be superior to @xmath12 out to 10 pc . with an increase of 4 mag , the @xmath1 band would surpass @xmath12 out to 25 pc  but as such a large sensitivity increase would be difficult to achieve , @xmath12 band will likely remain the primary wavelength for stars at 25 pc and beyond . for stars closer than 10 pc , however , the @xmath1 band already offers excellent sensitivity that has barely been exploited so far .",
    "given reasonable sensitivity increases , @xmath1 should become the primary band for planet searches around stars at a distance of 10 pc or less .",
    "interestingly , the conclusions of figures [ fig : hlm1 ] and [ fig : hlm2 ] are essentially independent of age : extensive calculations by @xcite showed that the relative usefulness of different wavelengths had only a weak dependence on age , for stars at a fixed distance  and even this weak age dependence could change sign on switching from the models of @xcite to those of @xcite .",
    "this means that if we change the ages of the stars in figures [ fig : hlm1 ] and [ fig : hlm2 ] but leave the distances the same , the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath12 band curves will slide up or down but remain essentially fixed in their relative positions .",
    "for example , given a 3 magnitude increase in sensitivity at both wavelengths , @xmath1 band observations will detect lower mass planets than @xmath12-band ones around a star at 10 pc , whether the stellar age is 5 gyr , 1 gyr , or 100 myr .",
    "this is to be expected , since if one dials down the age of a given hypothetical star system , the @xmath53  ( and therefore ir color ) of the faintest detectable planets will remain about the same , though their masses will decrease .    again , figures [ fig : hlm1 ] and [ fig : hlm2 ] apply only to background - limited sensitivity .",
    "however , given the much more favorable planet / star flux ratios in the @xmath1 band relative to @xmath12 , we would expect the longer wavelength observations to remain equally competitive closer to the star .",
    "advances in @xmath1 band coronography will likely parallel the development of @xmath12 band extreme ao systems such as gpi and sphere .",
    "though at present they are surpassed in sensitivity by @xmath12-regime observations for all but the nearest stars , the @xmath0 and especially the @xmath1 bands hold considerable promise for the future .",
    "we have surveyed unusually nearby , mature star systems for extrasolar planets in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands using the clio camera with the mmt ao system . by extensive use of blind sensitivity tests involving fake planets inserted into our raw data ( reported in detail in @xcite )",
    ", we established a definitive significance vs. completeness relation for planets in our data , which we then used in monte carlo simulations to constrain planet distributions .",
    "we set interesting limits on the masses of planets and brown dwarfs in the star systems we surveyed , but we did not detect any planets . based on this null result , we place constraints on the power laws that may describe the distribution of extrasolar planets in mass and semimajor axis .",
    "we also place constraints on planet abundances independent of the distributions .",
    "if the distribution of planets is a power law with @xmath5 , the work of @xcite and @xcite indicates that the most optimistic ( i.e. planet - rich ) case permitted by the statistics of known rv planets correponds to about @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "normalizing the distribution to be consistent with rv statistics , we find that these values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are ruled out at the 90% confidence level , unless the semimajor axis distribution is truncated at a radius @xmath34 less than 110 au .",
    "though @xmath47 is not physically plausible , previous work has sometimes used it an example : for @xmath48 , corresponding to the best - fit value from @xcite , we rule out @xmath47 unless @xmath34 is less than 38 au .",
    "independent of distribution models , with 90% confidence no more than 50% of stars like those in our survey have a 5 m@xmath10  or more massive planet orbiting between 30 and 94 au , no more than 15% have a 10 m@xmath10  planet orbiting between 22 and 100 au , and no more than 25% have a 20 m@xmath10  object orbiting between 8 and 100 au .",
    "our constraints on planet abundances are similar to those placed by @xcite and @xcite , but less tight than those of @xcite and especially @xcite , the recent work of @xcite and @xcite also placed tighter constraints on exoplanet distributions than our survey .",
    "however , we have surveyed a more nearby , older set of stars than any previous survey , and have therefore placed constraints on a more mature population of planets .",
    "also , we have confirmed that a paucity of giant planets at large separations from sun - like stars is robustly observed at a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "the best current @xmath12 regime observations , those of @xcite , would attain sensitivity to lower mass planets than did our @xmath0 and @xmath1 band observations for all of our survey targets except those lying within 4 pc of the sun .",
    "however , as larger telescopes are built and longer exposures are attempted , the sensitivity of @xmath1 band observations may be expected to increase at least as fast as that of @xmath12 band observations ( in part because @xmath1 band detectors are currently a less mature technology ) . as shown in figures [ fig : hlm1 ] and [ fig : hlm2 ] , a modest increase from current sensitivity levels , even if paralleled by an equal increase in @xmath12 band sensitivity , would render the @xmath1 band the wavelength of choice for extrasolar planet searches around a large number of nearby stars .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad online database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and the vizier online database ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have used digitized images from the palomar sky survey ( available from http://stdatu.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form ) , which were produced at the space telescope science institute under u.s .",
    "government grant nag w-2166 .",
    "the images of these surveys are based on photographic data obtained using the oschin schmidt telescope on palomar mountain and the uk schmidt telescope .",
