    "@xcite it was shown that @xmath2 is directly related to the difference in the event planes reconstructed from positive and negative particles .",
    "this difference is similar to the effect of a ( electro ) magnetic field oriented along the beam direction ( parallel or anti parallel ) .",
    "the existence of such a field in a symmetric collision would constitute parity violation .",
    "experimental measurements of the effect by na49 collaboration revealed a signal consistent with zero  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this observable have not been measured at rhic yet .",
    "more recently , it was noticed  @xcite that in non - central nuclear collisions such domains can demonstrate themselves via the asymmetry in the emission of positively or negatively charged particle perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "such charge separation is a consequence of the difference in the number of particles with positive and negative helicities positioned in the strong magnetic field ( @xmath3  t ) of a non - central nuclear collision , the so - called _ chiral magnetic effect _",
    "the same phenomenon can also be described in terms of the induced electric field that is parallel to the static external magnetic field , which occurs in the presence of topologically non - trivial vacuum solutions  @xcite .",
    "the direction of the separation varies event by event in accord with the sign of the topological charge of the domain , and the observation of the effect is possible only by correlation techniques .",
    "an observable directly sensitive to the charge separation effect , has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it is discussed in more detail below .    according to refs .",

    "[ eq : correlator ] this correlator represents the difference between correlations `` projected '' onto the reaction plane and the correlations projected onto an axis perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "the key advantage of using such a difference is that it removes all the correlations among particles @xmath10 and @xmath13 that are not related to the reaction plane orientation.the contribution given by the term @xmath16 can be neglected because directed flow averages to zero in a rapidity region symmetric with respect to mid - rapidity .    * _ rp dependent , `` physics '' , background .",

    "it was found that such a dependence can be naturally understood if one assumes that the @xmath23 distribution of correlated pairs has somewhat harder spectrum compared to that of all ( random ) pairs .",
