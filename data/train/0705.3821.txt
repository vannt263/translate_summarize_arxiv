    "if it is not than by lemma  [ existencehf ] we can find a deformation @xmath532 , where @xmath532 is a solution of the heat flow with initial map @xmath108 .",
    "the same argument as in the proof of lemma  [ bpar ] yields the formula @xmath533 where @xmath534 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath239 .",

    "since the curves are homotopic with fixed end - points , the former has to be also a geodesic and , moreover , does not depend on @xmath414 and coincides with the curve @xmath538 .",
    "now from the heat flow equation , we conclude that each @xmath108 is a weyl harmonic map .",
    "the statement on the parallelism of @xmath539 follows from the observation that the operator field @xmath540 is parallel along each geodesic @xmath491 .",
    "indeed , for an orthonormal basis @xmath541 for @xmath239 , each vector field @xmath542 coincides with @xmath517 and is parallel along @xmath491 . in particular , we see that the energy density @xmath543 is constant along @xmath491 .",
    "finally , note that the vectors @xmath517 span the image of @xmath544 .",
    "when @xmath3 has negative sectional curvature  ( * ? ?",

    "this yields the last statement of the theorem .",
    "in this appendix we collected the bochner - type identities for the pseudo - harmonic setting , which are important for the analysis above .",
    "first , we consider the solutions of the elliptic equation @xmath547 as above the symbol @xmath115 stands for the weyl laplacian , @xmath116 .",
    "[ bell ] let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be arbitrary riemannian manifolds and suppose that @xmath2 is endowed with a weyl connection @xmath62 preserving @xmath36 .",

    "first , recall the general bochner formula for any smooth map @xmath549 , see  @xcite , @xmath550 where @xmath32 and @xmath126 stand for the levi - civita connection of @xmath36 and its ricci curvature respectively . since the map @xmath6 is pseudo - harmonic , relation   implies that the tension field @xmath19 is equal to @xmath551 , where the constant @xmath552 equals @xmath553 .",
    "hence , for the last term in identity   we obtain the following : @xmath554 it is a straightforward calculation to show that the first term in this sum together with the quantity @xmath555 in the left - hand side in   gives exactly the weyl laplacian @xmath556 .",
    "the second term can be further transformed as @xmath557 now the lemma follows by the combination of this with the bochner formula  .    the next lemma is concerned with solutions of the pseudo - harmonic map heat flow , the corresponding parabolic equation ; @xmath558    [ bpar ] let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be arbitrary riemannian manifolds and suppose that @xmath2 is endowed with a weyl connection @xmath62 preserving the conformal class of @xmath36 . then for any smooth solution of equation   the following relations hold @xmath559,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath560 where @xmath118 and the systems @xmath119 and @xmath120 are orthonormal bases in @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively at the point under consideration ; the symbol @xmath126 denotes the ricci curvature of @xmath2 and @xmath124 stands for the curvature tensor of @xmath3 .",
    "the first relation follows in a similar fashion as in the proof of lemma  [ bell ] .",
    "now we demonstrate the second relation .",
    "standard calculations imply the following bochner - type formula for the family of mappings @xmath472 @xmath561 cf .",
    "now the claim follows by substituting in this formula @xmath562 for the tension field @xmath19 and making elementary transformations .",
