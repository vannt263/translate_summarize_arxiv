    "the tevatron accelerator complex produces @xmath4 collisions with a center of mass energy of @xmath5 , and the cdf and d0 experiments have so far recorded @xmath6  fb@xmath7 of collision data .",
    "just a fraction of this data allowed establishing a successful experimental programme of physics of the top quark and of the electroweak sector . in the following , we summarise the main measurements and report on preliminary results based on the latest data analyses .",
    "top quarks are produced and observed at the tevatron in their pair and singlet modes .",
    "measurements of the cross section allow testing of the production and decay mechanisms of the top and its coupling in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the pair production of top and anti - top in @xmath4 collisions has been measured with increasing precision since its discovery in 1995 @xcite at the tevatron .",
    "figure [ fig : d0_top_pair_xsec ] shows the most recent measurements using data collected by the d0 experiment @xcite in various decay channels . as top quarks decay almost exclusively to @xmath8 , the final states of @xmath0 events are labelled as _ dilepton _ , _ lepton plus jets _ and _ all - hadronic _ depending on whether a leptonic decay has occurred in both , one only or none of the two final - state @xmath1 bosons respectively .",
    "all results are in agreement with each other and in agreement with the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation for @xmath0 production in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath9  tev of 7.5@xmath100.8  pb @xcite .",
    "preliminary measurements are also shown in figure [ fig : d0_top_pair_xsec ] , performed with 4.35.3  fb@xmath7 of collision data , and yield individually a precision of @xmath11% , similar to the theoretical uncertainty . since a large component ( about 6% ) of the experimental uncertainty on the @xmath0 cross section",
    "is due to the uncertainty on the luminosity determination , higher precision can be obtained by measuring the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath2-boson cross sections @xmath12 @xcite and using the theoretical @xmath2 boson cross section calculation as input .",
    "with such an approach , the uncertainty on the luminosity largely cancels out and the most accurate preliminary determination of the @xmath0 cross section , combining samples in all decay channels seen with the cdf  ii detector @xcite yields : @xmath13  pb ( for a top mass of @xmath14 ) , in excellent agreement with nlo calculations and with an experimental uncertainty of only @xmath15% .    the electroweak production of single top quarks has been established at the tevatron in 2009 @xcite .",
    "a preliminary measurement using 4.8  fb@xmath7 of collision data recorded with the d0 detector has now been completed in the @xmath16+jets decay channel , measuring @xmath17  pb . figure [ fig : singletop ] shows the current best measurements of single top cross section ( @xmath18-channel and @xmath19-channel combined ) and the preliminary tevatron combined cross section of @xmath20  pb , in agreement with the nlo theoretical prediction of @xmath21  pb @xcite ( for @xmath22 ) .",
    "this also allows extraction of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath23 with a 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "lower limit of @xmath24 .",
    "measurements of single top cross section performed with data collected by the cdf and d0 collaborations . also indicated the preliminary tevatron combination . ]",
    "measurements of single top cross section performed with data collected by the cdf and d0 collaborations . also indicated the preliminary tevatron combination . ]",
    "the mass of the top quark is of interest both because the top is the heaviest known fundamental particle and because a precise measurement helps constraining the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "we present two preliminary measurements using events in the dilepton and lepton plus jets final states reconstructed with the cdf  ii detector .",
    "the analyses were based respectively on 4.8 fb@xmath7 and 5.6 fb@xmath7 of collision data and yield experimental top mass values of @xmath25  gev/@xmath26 and @xmath27  gev/@xmath26 .",
    "figure [ fig : topmass ] shows the cdf combination of top mass measurements , @xmath28  gev/@xmath26 , which with an accuracy of @xmath29 is more precise than the previous world average @xcite .",
    "moreover , measurements derived using all the @xmath0 decay channels are consistent with each other , and a preliminary determination of the top and anti - top mass difference using 5.6  fb@xmath7 of collision data recorded with the cdf  ii detector gives @xmath30  gev/@xmath26 .",
    "taking into account the preliminary results quoted above , the new tevatron combined experimental top mass determination is @xmath31  gev/@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "projections indicate that the tevatron experiments should reach individually a precision of @xmath100.81.0  gev/@xmath26 with @xmath32  fb@xmath7 of data .    the experimental study of physics of top quarks at the tevatron includes the determination of a variety of properties in addition to the production cross section and the top quark mass .",
    "measurement of properties such as the production mechanism , the forward - backward asymmetry and differential cross sections for example are only recently approaching the accuracy needed to test the sm predictions .",
    "we present two preliminary results on the width of the top quark . in the first , using 4.3  fb@xmath7 of tevatron s @xmath4 collision data collected by the cdf  ii detector , we exploit the reconstructed top quark mass to set an upper limit on the top quark width ( @xmath33 ) of @xmath34 at 95% c.l .",
    "we also set a central limit of @xmath35 at 68% c.l . in the second result",
    ", we extract the total width of the top quark from the partial decay width @xmath36 and the branching fraction @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath36 is obtained from the measured @xmath19-channel cross section for single top quark production in 2.3 fb@xmath7 of @xmath4 data from the d0 collaboration , and @xmath37 is extracted from a measurement of the ratio @xmath38 in @xmath0 events in 1 fb@xmath7 of integrated luminosity .",
    "assuming @xmath39 , where @xmath40 includes any kinematically accessible quark , the result is : @xmath41 which corresponds to a top quark lifetime of @xmath42  s.    a preliminary measurement of the top quark charge , based on 2.7  fb@xmath7 of collision data collected with the cdf  ii detector and using soft electron and muon @xmath43-tagging , now excludes a top quark charge of @xmath44 with 95% c.l , extending the significance of a previous result .",
    "measurements of the dynamics of production and decay of the top quark are of importance because they are sensitive to new production and decay mechanisms .",
    "for example , sm top pair production induces a characteristic spin correlation which can be modified by new production mechanisms such as @xmath45 bosons or kaluza - klein gluons @xcite .",
    "we report on a preliminary measurement of @xmath0 helicity fractions and spin correlation in 5.3  fb@xmath7 of reconstructed lepton+jets data with the cdf  ii detector . choosing the direction of the top quark momentum as the spin quantization axis ( the _ helicity basis _ )",
    ", we find a spin correlation coefficient @xmath46 , in agreement with the nlo expectation of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we also report a preliminary measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry of pair produced top quarks in 5.3  fb@xmath7 of data collected with the cdf  ii detector . a small asymmetry of 0.038@xmath100.006 in the laboratory rest frame",
    "is expected in quantum chromo dynamics at nlo @xcite and large positive asymmetries with large uncertainties were measured at cdf and d0 @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath48 , in agreement with the sm .",
    "comparison of the @xmath1 boson charge asymmetry measured by the cdf and d0 collaborations as a function of lepton @xmath49 , for lepton s transverse energies @xmath50 .",

    "a precise measurement of the @xmath1 boson mass ( @xmath51 ) provides a measurement of quantum loop corrections , and in the sm these corrections to @xmath51 are contributed predominantly by the top quark and the higgs boson loops .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 in conjunction with the top quark mass constrains the mass @xmath52 of the undiscovered higgs boson .",
    "the most recent combination of @xmath51 measurements at the tevatron is reported in detail elsewhere @xcite , and when combined with measurements at the lep collider yields the value @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "overall , precision electroweak measurements , including the preliminary value presented in this article of @xmath54 , indicate the preferred higgs boson mass of @xmath55 , or @xmath56 at 95% c.l .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1 boson mass , the decay width of the @xmath1 is also of importance towards a stringent test of the sm and can be used to constrain other sm parameters , such as the @xmath57 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element .",
    "a recent combination of the cdf and d0 run  i and run  ii measurements , which are based on fits to tails of the @xmath1 transverse mass @xcite distributions , yields @xmath58 @xcite , and a preliminary world average including both the tevatron and lep2 gives @xmath59 .",
    "the production of @xmath1 bosons at the tevatron is subject to a well known charge asymmetry , due to the different fraction of the proton momentum carried on average by @xmath60 and @xmath61 quarks : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath1 boson rapidity @xcite and @xmath64 is the differential cross section for @xmath65 or @xmath66 boson production .",
    "previous measurements @xcite have been published by the d0 and cdf collaborations , based on candidate @xmath67 events in 0.75  fb@xmath7 and 1  fb@xmath7 of collision data respectively , in which comparisons to monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of @xmath1 production and decay showed generally good agreement .",
    "we present a direct comparison of these analyses with an additional preliminary measurement based on candidate @xmath68 events in 4.9  fb@xmath7 of collision data collected with the d0 detector .",
    "the data are compared to mc event simulation from resbos @xcite with cteq6.6 @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , as a function of the lepton pseudo - rapidity @xmath69 , in different ranges of the lepton s transverse energy ( @xmath70 ) . while in the low @xmath70 the data are well reproduced by the mc , for @xmath50 discrepancies",
    "start to emerge and the mc is now seen to overestimate the asymmetry at large @xmath49 ( see figure [ fig : wasymm ] ) with respect to both cdf and d0 experimental data .",
    "the presence of both vector and axial - vector couplings in @xmath71 gives rise to an asymmetry also for @xmath2 bosons in the polar angle of the negatively charged lepton momentum relative to the incoming quark direction in the rest frame of the lepton pair .",
    "we present a preliminary measurement of such forward - backward asymmetry in the kinematic region where the invariant mass ( @xmath72 ) of the lepton pair is between 50 and 600  gev/@xmath26 .",
    "the data sample consists of 4.1  fb@xmath7 of @xmath4 collisions recorded by the cdf  ii detector .",
    "figure [ fig : zfb ] shows the data compared with pythia  v6.216 @xcite , indicating very good agreement across the entire @xmath72 spectrum .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry is sensitive to @xmath73 , which is an effective parameter that includes higher order corrections .",
    "the current world average value of @xmath73 is 0.23145@xmath100.00013 @xcite , the d0 collaboration measured @xmath74 from an earlier @xmath2 forward - backward asymmetry measurement @xcite based on 1.1  fb@xmath7 of collision data and we plan to soon report @xmath73 from the cdf preliminary measurement presented here .",

    "invariant mass for the @xmath2 candidates reconstructed in the 4 @xmath75 candidate events . ]",
    "the measurement of heavy diboson production in @xmath4 collisions is a way of probing the structure of the electroweak sector , as the presence of anomalous triple gauge bosons couplings for instance could indicate new physics at a higher mass scale .",
    "moreover , as these processes are backgrounds to some higgs boson decay signatures , their measurement provides milestones on the way to sensitivity to a higgs boson production measurement .",
    "heavy diboson production has been established at the tevatron in several final states using 13  fb@xmath7 @xcite . as the collision data available increases , the precision of these measurements is being progressively improved .",
    "we report on a preliminary measurement of @xmath77 and @xmath75 production in three- and four - lepton channels , using @xmath78  fb@xmath7 of data collected by the cdf experiment . from 50 @xmath79 candidate events and 4 @xmath80 candidate events ,",
    "we measure @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are minimised by measuring the experimental ratio to the inclusive @xmath83 cross section and using the theoretical value of @xmath84 production cross section .",
    "figure [ fig : zzmass ] shows the distribution of invariant mass for the @xmath2 candidates reconstructed in the 4 @xmath75 candidate events .",
    "the measurements are in agreement with the lo theoretical prediction of @xmath85  pb and @xmath86  pb , and in agreement with earlier measurements at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "we also report on a preliminary measurement of combined @xmath87 production cross section in the channel with an identified electron or muon , large missing transverse energy and two jets in 4.6  fb@xmath7 of cdf  ii data .",
    "the analysis employs a matrix element technique which calculates event probability densities for signal and background hypotheses .",
    "the probabilities are used to form a discriminant variable which is evaluated for signal and background events .",
    "the resulting template distributions are fit to the data using a binned likelihood approach , and yield a cross section @xmath88 .",
    "the measurement increases the precision of previous determinations @xcite and is in agreement with the theory prediction of 16.1@xmath100.9  pb @xcite .",
    "we have presented recent preliminary measurements at tevatron of top pair and single production cross section , top quark mass and width , top pair spin correlations and forward - backward asymmetry . in the electroweak sector , we have presented a new tevatron average of the @xmath1 boson width , and preliminary measurements of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 forward - backward asymmetries and @xmath89 diboson production cross sections .",
