    "perhaps the most convincing proof of the non - classical nature of quantum statistics is the violation of bell s inequalities by a pair of entangled spin-1/2 particles @xcite .",
    "several experimental tests of these inequalities have been performed on pairs of entangled photons generated either by two photon emission @xcite or by parametric down conversion @xcite .",
    "these experimental tests compare the polarization correlations of photon pairs emitted at the same time for different sets of orthogonal polarizations .",
    "while no information about the relationship between non - orthogonal polarization directions of the single photon are revealed in such measurements , the statistics obtained correspond to the quantum theoretical prediction . since the quantum formalism from which the violation of bell s inequalities is derived",
    "is widely accepted , one might wonder whether it should not be possible to obtain a clearer understanding of the origin of this non - classical effect by investigating the unique statistical connection between non - commuting quantum variables in more detail .",
    "in particular , finite resolution measurements can provide quantitative information about a quantum variable without destroying the quantum coherence between different eigenstate components of that variable @xcite . by applying finite resolution measurements ,",
    "it is therefore possible to identify the non - classical correlations between non - commuting variables directly @xcite . in the following",
    ", an experiment is proposed to determine the correlations between non - orthogonal polarizations of entangled photon pairs .",
    "it is shown that the violation of bell s inequalities results from the negative joint probabilities arising from local non - classical correlations of the photon polarization .",
    "it is then possible to give a local interpretation of entanglement based on standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : postulate ] , the application of finite resolution measurements to the polarization of a single photon is discussed and fundamental non - classical correlations are derived . in section [ sec : entangle ] , the experimental setup for a measurement of entangled photon pairs is presented and the statistical results of such a measurement are derived . in section [ sec : quantcorr ] , the non - classical features of the statistics are identified and the implications concerning the nature of entanglement are discussed .",
    "finally , the conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "a measurement assigns a quantity to a system property based on the observable action of the system on some measurement device .",
    "the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics requires that this interaction between the system and the measurement setup introduces noise into properties that do not commute with the measured variable .",
    "therefore , the classical ideal of a complete determination of all system properties is unattainable .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to obtain quantitative information on the correlations between non - commuting variables by limiting the measurement resolution .",
    "such a finite resolution measurement is described by the generalized measurement operator @xmath0 , which assigns a continuous measurement value @xmath1 to the operator @xmath2@xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath3 for a given initial state @xmath4 , the probability @xmath5 of obtaining a measurement result @xmath1 and the state @xmath6 after the measurement are then given by @xmath7 note that this generalized measurement postulate does not restrict the values of an operator variable to the eigenvalues of that operator .",
    "eigenvalues emerge only in infinitely precise measurements .",
    "one of the fundamental problems in the discussion of quantum mechanics is that eigenvalues are often identified with `` elements of reality''@xcite regardless of the measurement context discussed . by assigning a continuous measurement value to the operator variable in a finite resolution measurement this identification",
    "is avoided , allowing a determination of quantitative results beyond the spectrum of its eigenvalues .",
    "the polarization of a single photon can be described in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath8 . in terms of the circular polarization eigenstates @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the operators of the three single photon stokes parameters may be written as @xmath11 @xmath12 represents the intensity difference between the x and y polarizations , @xmath13 represents the intensity difference between the polarizations along the diagonals between the x and y axes , and @xmath14 represents the intensity difference between the circular polarizations .",
    "since only one photon is considered , the eigenvalues of each stokes parameter are @xmath15 .",
    "a finite resolution measurement of photon polarization can be realized by using a polarization sensitive beam displacer that shifts the x - polarization component relative to the y - polarization component of the light field .",
    "the displacement of the photon trajectory in the beam displacer can be interpreted as the action of the one - photon stokes parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the polarization of the photon is then described by a continuous value @xmath16 of the stokes parameter @xmath12 obtained from the measurement of the transversal photon position after the beam displacer .",
    "the measurement resolution depends on the ratio of the displacement and the width of the input beam .",
    "if the transversal profile of the light field is gaussian , the generalized measurement postulate describes the single photon polarization statistics obtained by measuring the polarization dependent displacement of the photon . in terms of the circular polarization eigenstates ,",
    "the measurement operator is given by @xmath17 this operator describes the changes in the quantum state of the single photon polarization conditioned by the finite resolution measurement of the stokes parameter @xmath12 .      in order to measure the correlated non - orthogonal polarization components of a single photon",
    ", the finite resolution measurement can be combined with a fully resolved polarization measurement . by rotating the polarization by an angle of @xmath18 and separating the x and y components as shown in figure [ setup1 ] , the eigenvalues of the stokes parameter @xmath13",
    "are measured .",
    "two spatial patterns emerge , corresponding to the conditional distributions of continuous measurement results @xmath16 of the stokes parameter @xmath12 associated with a final measurement of the eigenvalues @xmath19 or @xmath20 of the stokes parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the positive valued operator measure ( pom ) describing the joint measurement of @xmath12 and @xmath13 is defined by projections onto the states @xmath22 the joint probabilities @xmath23 for measuring a finite resolution value of @xmath16 for the stokes parameter @xmath12 followed by an eigenvalue of @xmath24 for the stokes parameter @xmath13 is then given by @xmath25 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary initial state .",
    "this pom thus assigns quantitative results to both stokes parameters , allowing a derivation of correlations between the polarization components of a single photon .",
    "if the light field entering the measurement setup shown in figure [ setup1 ] is polarized along the diagonal between the x and y axes , the initial photon state is given by @xmath26 the joint probabilities of the measurement results @xmath16 and @xmath27 can then be determined using equation ( [ eq : joint ] ) . in its most compact form",
    ", it reads @xmath28 note that @xmath29 is always exactly equal to zero , even if @xmath30 is larger than one . obviously , this result is too exact to be explained in terms of a random measurement error superimposed on classical statistics .",
    "the result for a measurement resolution of @xmath31 is illustrated in figure [ condprop1 ] .",
    "the peaks in @xmath32 are shifted to values of about @xmath33 and the asymmetry of the peaks seems to favor even higher values .",
    "these results can hardly be explained by statistics originating only from the eigenvalues of @xmath34 .",
    "the non - classical features of the joint probabilities @xmath23 can be analyzed by expressing the result as a sum of shifted normalized gaussian distributions @xmath35 in terms of these gaussians , the joint probabilities read @xmath36 each gaussian contribution to the joint probabilities given in equation ( [ eq : sumcp ] ) can be identified with elements of the density matrix of the original state in the eigenstate basis of the observable @xmath12 . as discussed in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", the measurement of @xmath16 modifies each matrix element by a decoherence factor given by the difference of the eigenvalues and an information factor depending on the difference between the measurement result @xmath16 and the average of the eigenvalues .",
    "the decoherence factor @xmath37 is a result of the quantum noise in the measurement required by the uncertainty principle . in the case of the beam displacer acting on single photons ,",
    "it is the uncertainty of the wave vector dependent time the photon spends in the birefringent medium which randomly rotates the stokes vector around the @xmath38 axis .",
    "since this noisy interaction is statistically independent of the measurement result , it is possible to separate its effect from the information obtained about the system .",
    "a hypothetical noise free measurement then reveals negative probabilities of @xmath39 for measurement results @xmath16 close to zero @xcite .",
    "these negative probabilities describe the non - classical correlations between non - commuting operator variables @xcite .",
    "the information about @xmath12 obtained in the measurement modifies the statistical weight of each density matrix element by a gaussian function of the difference between the measurement result @xmath16 and the average of the two eigenvalues of the density matrix element . in particular , the gaussians centered around @xmath40 represent contributions from the quantum coherence between the @xmath41 and the @xmath42 eigenstates conditioned by a measurement of @xmath16 .",
    "measurement results close to @xmath40 enhance the coherence and increase the probability of @xmath43 to values above 1 , while measurement results far away from @xmath40 reduce the coherence , lowering the probability of @xmath43 to values below 1 . in order to explain this non - classical correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath27 , some measure of reality",
    "must be attributed to @xmath44 , even though it is not an eigenvalue of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "since the width of the gaussians represents the effect of random noise in the readout of the finite resolution measurement , it is reasonable to identify each gaussian contribution with its average value of @xmath16 .",
    "the continuum of measurement values @xmath16 can then be represented by a discrete set of three values at @xmath45 and @xmath44 .",
    "the joint probabilities for these three values of @xmath38 and the two eigenvalues of @xmath27 read @xmath46 these joint probabilities explain the non - classical features of the quantum statistics obtained from the single photon polarization measurement setup shown in figure [ setup1 ] for any value of the measurement resolution @xmath30 .",
    "it should be noted that the measurement setup itself defines an asymmetry between @xmath12 and @xmath13 since the non - eigenvalue of zero appears only in the statistics of the initial finite resolution measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "this dependence on the order of measurement is reflected in the operator order dependence of quantum mechanical expectation values . in order to identify the operator properties responsible for the appearance of negative probabilities in the statistical properties , it is useful to characterize the measurement statistics in terms of the correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath27 , @xmath48 & = & - 2 ( \\langle s_{1m}^2 \\rangle-\\delta\\!s^2 ) \\langle",
    "s_2 \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - 2 \\exp\\left(- \\frac{1}{2\\delta\\!s^2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 denotes statistical averages over actual measurement results .",
    "this correlation may be expressed in terms of the operator expectation values of @xmath4 as @xmath50 as explained above , the exponential factor expresses the randomization of @xmath13 induced by the measurement of @xmath12 according to the uncertainty principle . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the noise introduced in the measurement of @xmath12 goes to zero and the correlation is given by the operator expectation values of the initial state . due to the operator ordering",
    ", the anti - correlation between @xmath52 and @xmath27 is an inherent statistical property of @xmath4 even though @xmath4 is an eigenstate of @xmath13 .",
    "thus operator ordering allows a correlation between fluctuating properties and seemingly well defined operator variables of the quantum state .",
    "this property implies that even the eigenvalues of a quantum state do not represent `` elements of reality '' .",
    "consequently , it is wrong to assign measurement values to physical properties before the measurement _ even if the measurement result can be predicted with certainty_. since the violation of bell s inequalities depends on the assignment of such `` elements of reality '' it is not surprising that it can be violated by quantum theory . in the following , it will be shown how the violation of bell s inequalities can be explained in terms of negative joint probabilities obtained from finite resolution measurements .",
    "entangled photon pairs can be created in two photon emission @xcite or in parametric down conversion @xcite .",
    "the precise polarization statistics may vary depending on the geometry of the setup . in order to express the violation of bell s inequalities in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "it is useful to rotate the polarizations of the two photons in such a way that the quantum state is given by @xmath53 this state is an eigenstate of two polarization correlations , @xmath54 the sum of these two eigenvalues violates a bell s inequality of the form @xmath55 it is therefore not possible to interpret the polarization statistics by assigning eigenvalues of @xmath15 to each stokes parameter .",
    "however , as indicated by the results of finite resolution measurements on the polarization of single photons discussed in section [ sec : postulate ] above , such an identification of physical properties with their eigenvalues is not even consistent with the correlated statistics of local single photon properties . the non - classical statistical properties responsible for the violation of bell s inequality ( [ ineq : bell ] ) can be derived in detail by applying the finite resolution measurement setup introduced above to realize a polarization measurement on the entangled photon pairs given by equation ( [ eq : eprstate ] ) .",
    "figure [ setup2 ] shows the experimental setup for a measurement of the correlations in the bell s inequality ( [ ineq : bell ] ) .",
    "the detector arrays record coincidence counts between the right and left hand side .",
    "each detector array corresponds to an eigenvalue measurement of @xmath13 .",
    "the spatial coordinate at which the photon is registered corresponds to the continuous measurement value @xmath16 of @xmath12 .",
    "each measurement result can then be identified with a point in one of four two dimensional graphs .",
    "the probability distribution for the measurement outcomes of the joint measurements may be determined by projections onto the non - orthogonal , non - normalized set of states @xmath56 in their most compact form , the joint probabilities of the measurement results @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for the entangled input state @xmath61 given by equation ( [ eq : eprstate ] ) read @xmath62 figure [ condprop2 ] shows the results for a measurement resolution of @xmath31 . at this intermediate resolution ,",
    "quantum mechanical interference effects are especially visible @xcite . in particular , separate peaks can be resolved clearly , but quantum interference effects are visible in the asymmetric peak shapes and in the zero probability valleys in the @xmath63 regions separating the peaks . as in the single photon case discussed in section [ sec : postulate ] above",
    ", it is indeed possible to interpret these features entirely in terms of gaussian distributions .",
    "however , negative probability contributions centered around values of @xmath40 have to be included in order to explain the asymmetries and the regions of extremely low probabilities near @xmath40 separating the peaks corresponding to quantized results around @xmath64 .      as in the one photon case , the regions of low probability at values of @xmath65 can be traced back to negative joint probabilities .",
    "the measurement probabilities given by equation ( [ eq : totprop ] ) may be expressed as a sum of shifted normalized gaussian distributions @xmath66 since the shifts @xmath67 and @xmath68 may be @xmath20 , @xmath69 or @xmath19 , respectively , each of the four sums has nine components associated with joint probabilities of the four stokes parameters . the probability distribution of the measurement results is then given by the sum @xmath70 & \\hspace{1 cm } & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{16\\sqrt{2 } }   \\left(g_{\\delta\\!s}\\left(s_{1m}(a)+1;s_{1m}(b)+1\\right)+   g_{\\delta\\!s}\\left(s_{1m}(a)-1;s_{1m}(b)-1\\right)\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{16\\sqrt{2 } }   \\left(g_{\\delta\\!s}\\left(s_{1m}(a)+1;s_{1m}(b)-1\\right)+   g_{\\delta\\!s}\\left(s_{1m}(a)-1;s_{1m}(b)+1\\right)\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\delta\\!s^2}\\right )   \\frac{1}{8\\sqrt{2 } } s_2(b )   \\left(g_{\\delta\\!s}\\left(s_{1m}(a)+1;s_{1m}(b)\\right ) - g_{\\delta\\!s}\\left(s_{1m}(a)-1;s_{1m}(b)\\right)\\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\delta\\!s^2}\\right )   \\frac{1}{8\\sqrt{2}}s_2(a ) \\left(g_{\\delta\\!s}\\left(s_{1m}(a);s_{1m}(b)+1\\right ) - g_{\\delta\\!s}\\left(s_{1m}(a);s_{1m}(b)-1\\right)\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\delta\\!s^2}\\right )   \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{2 } } s_2(a ) s_2(b)\\ ;   g_{\\delta\\!s}\\left(s_{1m}(a);s_{1m}(b)\\right ) .",

    "the result reads @xmath71 this expectation value exceeds the maximal value of 2 allowed by inequality ( [ ineq : bell ] ) for measurement resolutions of @xmath72 .",

    "it is necessary to identify the decoherence factor @xmath85 with the quantum noise induced reduction of the expectation values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is then possible to remove the effects of noise and of finite measurement resolution from the measurement statistics , tracing the violation of bell s inequality directly to the appearance of negative probabilities in the joint probabilities for @xmath88,@xmath59,@xmath89 , and @xmath60 .",
    "as in the case of single photon polarization discussed in section [ sec : postulate ] , the sum of gaussians given in equation ( [ eq : eprcond ] ) can be interpreted in terms of joint probabilities for @xmath88,@xmath59,@xmath89 , and @xmath60 by identifying the average of each gaussian with the appropriate value of @xmath38 .",

    "their probabilities are all positive . in eight of these sixteen cases , three of the four correlations in inequality ( [ ineq",

    "more than outweighs the 32.3 % of the classical contributions , explaining the increase of the expectation value of @xmath83 beyond the limit of 2 .",

    ", the continuous distribution of finite resolution measurement results thus reveals clear evidence of these non - classical statistical features .",
    "the negative conditional probabilities shown in table [ negprop ] allow an interpretation of the measurement statistics in terms of individual measurement results observed separately in branch @xmath110 and in branch @xmath111 .",
    "there is neither a need for action at a distance , nor for non - local properties .",
    "the non - classical feature required to explain the violation of bell s inequalities is expressed in the negative probabilities which are possible even in individual quantum systems because the uncertainty principle does not allow an isolated measurement of a joint probability of non - commuting variables .",
    "once the relationship between uncertainty and negative conditional probabilities is understood , the problem of non - locality in entangled systems can be resolved by introducing local decompositions of the entangled state density matrix based on negative probability components of the local density matrices . for the state discussed above",
    ", one possible decomposition reads @xmath112 all by themselves , the stokes parameter operators @xmath8 would not qualify as density matrices because of their negative eigenvalues .",
    "once negative eigenvalue components are permitted , however , the decomposition given above can be interpreted as a separation of the entangled density matrix into products of local density matrices .",
    "the reason why density matrices with negative probability eigenvalues may be used in the decomposition of entangled states is that any measurement performed on system @xmath110 mixes contributions to the density matrix of system @xmath111 in such a way that the information required to isolate the negative conditional probabilities represented by the negative eigenvalues is lost .",
    "effectively , the uncertainty in system @xmath110 necessarily `` covers up '' the negative eigenvalues of the density matrix components of system @xmath111 by mixing them with positive components .",
    "entanglement can therefore be explained by the local properties of quantum measurements described previously @xcite . in the light of this result , it is not surprising that some applications of quantum mechanics such as quantum computation can work without entanglement @xcite .",
    "the most fundamental property of quantum mechanics is not entanglement , but local non - classical correlations represented by the operator - ordering dependence of expectation values and the negative conditional probabilities obtained from finite resolution measurements .",
    "the interpretation of quantum statistics can not be based on the assumption that potential measurement results represent `` elements of reality '' whether the actual measurement is performed or not .",
    "this is not only true for entangled systems , but also for combinations of finite resolution measurements performed to obtain the correlations between non - commuting operator variables in a single quantum system . as a result",
    ", concepts such as photon polarization have to be reviewed critically in order to understand the relationship between eigenvalues and operator variables .",
    "the experimental approach proposed above allows a direct determination of the non - classical features of the polarization statistics for both single photons and entangled pairs .",
    "its application to the violation of bell s inequalities reveals details of the statistical relationships between all four polarization components .",
    "a full set of conditional probabilities can be obtained from the statistics of a single measurement , revealing the negative conditional probabilities that are responsible for the violation of bell s inequalities .",
    "a comparison with the single photon polarization statistics reveals that such negative probabilities are also observable in the polarization of a single photon .",
