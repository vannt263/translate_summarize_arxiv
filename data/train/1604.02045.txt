    "discrepancies of up to 20% can be absorbed in an effective hydrodynamic radius @xmath7 and a change of the boundary condition from stick to slip.@xcite in the absence of values of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 the ser is often employed to estimate the missing quantity .",

    "this alternative equation is frequently referred to as stokes - einstein - debye relation ( sedr ) , assuming @xmath9 @xmath10 the proportionality @xmath9 holds approximately , but breaks down even for simple binary glasses as the temperature is lowered.@xcite    it has been shown both in experiment @xcite and simulation @xcite that upon cooling towards the glass transition the ser breaks down , the diffusivity remaining much larger than estimated via the ser or sedr from the increase in viscosity or relaxation time .",

    ". both measurements of metallic glasses @xcite and computer simulations @xcite have however shown that there is already a weaker breakdown of the ser at much higher temperatures .",

    "solid type particles diffuse via hopping motion which is often regarded as nearest neighbor hopping . for a hard sphere model with density above the mct critical density",
    "it was argued that the breakdown is due to particles that hop over distances that are integers of the particle spacing ( solid like particles).@xcite alternatively the appearance of secondary peaks in the self correlation function is used.@xcite these secondary peaks are mainly observed for small minority components .",
    "we will show that the ser breakdown also occurs for the majority component where no secondary peak is found and which dominates the viscosity . in agreement with the experimental results on diffusion in metallic melts@xcite",
    "no typical length scale was found in simulations of cuzr.@xcite hopping motion can be identified but does not involve a definite length scale and in general can not easily be identified from the atomic self correlation function . in a metallic melt , jump processes are typically not jumps between localized sites but jumps of strings of atoms.@xcite    in composite liquids the breakdown of the ser occurs in general at different temperates for the different components.@xcite it has been argued that the breakdown of the ser is directly related to a dynamical decoupling of the components.@xcite such decoupling is in contradiction to the picture of collective string motion .",

    "<S> we investigate the origin of the breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation ( ser ) between diffusivity and viscosity in undercooled melts . a binary lennard - jones system , as a model for a metallic melt , </S>",

    "<S> a weak breakdown at high temperatures can be understood from the collectivization of motion , seen in the isotope effect . </S>",
    "<S> the strong breakdown at lower temperatures is connected to an increase in dynamic heterogeneity . on relevant timescales some particles diffuse much faster than the average or than predicted by the ser . </S>",
    "<S> the van - hove self correlation function allows to unambiguously identify slow particles . </S>",
    "<S> their diffusivity is even less than predicted by the ser . </S>",
    "<S> the time - span of these particles being slow particles , before their first conversion to be a fast one , is larger than the decay time of the stress correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the slow particles to the viscosity rises rapidly upon cooling . not only the diffusion but also the viscosity shows a dynamically heterogeneous scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we can define a `` slow '' viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> the ser is recovered as relation between slow diffusivity and slow viscosity .    </S>"
