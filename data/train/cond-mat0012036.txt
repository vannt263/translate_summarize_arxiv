    "quite a few very unusual physical properties characterize fcc ferromagnetic invar alloys .",
    "we can mention nearly zero thermal expansion coefficient , giant values of the volume magnetostriction , a strong pressure dependence of the curie temperature and of the saturation magnetization , anomalies in the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the elastic constant and other .",
    "the origin of the invar magnetic and structural instabilities has been intensively studied during the last decade ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    since actually",
    "all physical properties of invars are anomalous , one should not wonder that their plastic properties also strongly differ from those of the conventional fcc alloys @xcite .",
    "we can mention here the critical resolved shear stress in invars which grows with decreasing temperature with a rate , which is tens times larger than that of the normal alloys .",
    "an explanation of this effect has been recently proposed in our paper @xcite where the exchange interaction of the dangling d - states of the dislocation cores and solute atoms ( e.g. , ni atoms in feni invar alloys ) was considered .",
    "the current paper addresses the problem of the deformation hardening of invars by considering the long range interaction between dislocations which is mediated by the exchange energy variation induced by the elastic strains in the vicinity if the dislocations",
    ". it will be demonstrated below that the type of interactions appears to be anomalously strong in invar alloys .",
    "a study of dislocation properties in ferromagnetic alloys started more than half a century ago by brown @xcite who discussed the influence of edge dislocations on the magnetization of ferromagnetics in a strong magnetic field .",
    "this direction of study was continued by seeger and kronmller @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , only linear magnetostriction caused by the shear stresses in the vicinities of dislocations were taken into account in those studies .",
    "as for the volume magnetostriction , it was generally neglected .",
    "this neglect seems to be well justified in conventional ferromagnetics ( such as , say , fe or ni ) , since their volume magnetostriction is two or three orders of magnitude smaller than the linear one @xcite . considering the invar alloys one should keep in mind that their volume magnetostriction is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the conventional ferromagnetics @xcite and , hence",
    ", the neglect can be hardly justified .",
    "ferromagnetics are characterized by a very large contribution of the exchange interaction in the internal energy of the crystal .",
    "this contribution is proportional to the squared magnetization @xcite .",
    "dislocations induce hydrostatic strains in their vicinities which result in variations of the magnetization , and hence , of the exchange energy . in invars , with their anomalously strong volume magnetostriction , the variation of the exchange energy appears to be anomalously strong .",
    "one should expect , as a result , an anomalously strong contribution of the exchange effects in the interaction between dislocations .    introducing the notion of the exchange interaction between dislocations and paramagnetic obstacles",
    "has allowed the authors of this paper to explain the principal features of the electro- and magnetoplastic effects @xcite .",
    "recent studies demonstrate that sort of a `` chemical '' bonding between dislocation and obstacles may play an important part in plasticity of alloys @xcite .",
    "the exchange effects appear to be exceptionally strong in invars , as has been demonstrated in our previous paper @xcite , in which the anomalously strong temperature dependence of critical resolved shear stress of invars has been explained .",
    "we plan to calculate in the current paper the dislocation self energy and their interaction energy accounting both for the elastic and exchange contributions .",
    "it will be shown that anomalously strong volume magnetostriction in invars results in a large exchange energy variation , which becomes comparable with the elastic energy .",
    "this relates both to the energy associated with individual dislocations and to the interaction between the dislocations .",
    "this mechanism will allow us to explain the anomalous behavior of the deformation hardening of invars .",
    "we calculate in this section the change of the total energy of a crystal resulting from an introduction of an edge dislocation . this change may be called the dislocation self energy .",
    "there are two principal contributions to the dislocation self energy in a ferromagnetic .",
    "first , there is an elastic energy , associated with the strain field induced by the dislocation in its vicinity .",
    "second , there is an exchange energy , appearing due to the fact that this strain changes direction and absolute value of the local magnetizations * m*. the calculation of the elastic energy can be found in literature ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "here we shall concentrate on the calculation of the exchange energy of a dislocation .",
    "in particular , it will be shown below that the variation of the magnetization direction makes a contribution negligible as compared to that of the absolute value variation .",
    "the same can be said about the exchange energy variation due to the linear magnetostriction .",
    "the density of the exchange energy @xmath0 in a ferromagnetic is presented by many authors and contains two terms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath1 the first term here depends only on the absolute value of the magnetization @xmath2 , whereas , the second , gradient , term accounts for the space variations of @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the molecular field constant .",
    "@xmath4 is the interatomic spacing , @xmath5 is the first coordination number , @xmath6 is the curie temperature .",
    "@xmath7 is the effective number of the bohr magnetons per one atom , @xmath8 is the density of atoms , @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath10 is the bohr magneton .",
    "an edge dislocation creates a hydrostatic pressure @xcite @xmath11 slowly decaying with the distance @xmath12 from the dislocation core . here",
    "@xmath13 is the shear modulus , @xmath14 is the poisson coefficient , @xmath15 is the value of the burgers vector , @xmath16 is the angle counted from the direction of the burgers vector .",
    "the pressure @xmath17 induces a variation of the magnetization in the vicinity of the dislocation which in the linear , in the local pressure , approximation , can be represented as @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the uniform magnetization of the ferromagnetic in the absence of dislocations , @xmath20 is a proportionality constant known empirically for various ferromagnetics ( see , e.g. , @xcite for invars ) .",
    "now we can calculate the variation of the exchange energy of the ferromagnetic caused by an edge dislocation .",
    "the variation of the first term in equation ( [ exch ] ) , depending only on the absolute value of the magnetization , reads @xmath21.\\ ] ] integrating this expression over a plane perpendicular to the dislocation axis , one finds that the dislocation exchange energy per the dislocation unit length is @xmath22 the calculation of the integral ( [ exch2 ] ) was carried out under the same approximations as those used in the calculation of the elastic energy of the dislocation in a continuous medium @xcite .",
    "the integral is cut off at small distances , @xmath23 , and at large distances , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being of the order of the average distance between the dislocations .",
    "the gradient part of the dislocation exchange energy ( the second term in ( [ exch ] ) ) is calculated in a similar way , @xmath26 the quantity @xmath27 is about 10 for typical concentrations of dislocations ( @xmath28 to @xmath29@xmath30 ) , while @xmath31 in fcc lattices .",
    "therefore , the gradient term ( [ exch3 ] ) is about 10@xmath32 of the dislocation exchange energy ( [ exch2 ] ) .",
    "this difference of the two contribution follows mainly from the fact that the variation of the absolute value of the magnetization , @xmath33 , decays only as @xmath34 with the distance from the dislocation core , whereas the gradient , @xmath35 decays more rapidly as @xmath36 .",
    "we should also consider the contribution of the linear magnetostriction appearing due to the shear deformations induced by the dislocations .",
    "the change of the local magnetization is proportional the gradient of the angle @xmath37 defining the direction of the atomic spins .",
    "it means that the dislocation self energy due to the liner magnetostriction has generally the structure similar to that of the gradient term in ( [ exch ] ) and is also small .",
    "we shall neglect these two small contributions in what follows and omit the superscript @xmath38 in the exchange energy ( [ exch2 ] ) .",
    "we need also the elastic energy per dislocation unit length which in the same approximation @xcite reads @xmath39 now the total self energy of a dislocation ( per its unit length ) containing both elastic and exchange contributions can be represented as @xmath40 where @xmath41 here the equality @xmath42 connecting the young modulus @xmath43 with the shear modulus @xmath13 has been used .",
    "since the magnetization @xmath44 is a function of temperature , the exchange contribution to the total energy @xmath45 is also temperature dependent . as for the elastic contribution @xmath46 its very weak temperature dependence",
    "can be neglected . in order to estimate the temperature dependence of the total energy we may use the mean field approximation in the theory of the second order phase transitions , according which",
    "the magnetization is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the spontaneous magnetization of the ferromagnetic at zero temperature .",
    "then the factor ( [ factor1 ] ) can be represented as @xmath49 the simple formula ( [ magn ] ) for the magnetization works rather well in usual ferromagnetics in a wide range below the curie temperature . as for invar alloys , it holds up to the temperatures which are 20 to 30k below @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "closer to @xmath6 the magnetization does not go to zero but becomes very small and falls down slowly with the increasing temperature .",
    "now we demonstrate that only in invars the contribution of the exchange energy may be of importance .",
    "really , the exchange correction in the factor ( [ factor1 ] ) is very small in conventional ferromagnetics and @xmath50 is close to one .",
    "for example , ni is characterized by the following parameters : @xmath51 kg , @xmath52dyn/@xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xcite . as for the quantity",
    "@xmath20 its value according to @xcite is @xmath56 ( dyn/@xmath53)@xmath57 .",
    "then one finds that the exchange correction in ( [ factor1 ] ) does not exceed 2@xmath58 and , hence , can be neglected in normal ferromagnetics .",
    "the situation changes dramatically in invar alloys in which the quantity @xmath20 is one to two orders of magnitude larger than in normal ferromagnetics @xcite .",
    "for example , the fe@xmath59ni@xmath60 invar is characterized by @xmath61(dyn/@xmath62 @xcite which is nearly 40 times larger than in ni . as a result ,",
    "the exchange energy contribution , proportional to @xmath63 , becomes one thousand times larger .",
    "the factor @xmath50 for the fe@xmath59ni@xmath60 alloy can be estimated .",
    "first , the molecular field constant @xmath64 can be calculated using equation ( [ exch1 ] ) .",
    "it is know for this alloy that @xmath65k @xcite , @xmath66 @xcite , @xmath67@xmath30 which results in @xmath68 . then using the values @xmath69 , @xmath70dyn/@xmath53 , @xmath71 @xcite one finds that @xmath72 at low temperatures ( @xmath73 ) , meaning that the exchange effects are able to decrease the total dislocation self energy ( [ total ] ) by a factor of three .",
    "we may distinguish two types of interaction between dislocations connected with the magnetic structure of the ferromagnetic .",
    "the direct magnetic interaction between local magnetizations in the vicinities of parallel edge dislocations was calculated by krey @xcite .",
    "this interaction appears to be three orders of magnitude weaker than the elastic interaction even in invar alloys with their anomalously strong variations of the local magnetization .",
    "this allows us to neglect in what follows the direct magnetic interaction of dislocations .",
    "however , a special attention should be paid to the second type of interaction , i.e. , the interaction between the dislocations caused by the exchange effects , which can be much stronger than the direct magnetic interaction .",
    "considering the simplest case of two parallel edge dislocations in the same sliding plane , when they have either the same or the opposite mechanical signs , we can calculate the exchange energy contribution to the interaction between the dislocations .",
    "let @xmath74 be the vector connecting two dislocations .",
    "then the local pressure induced by these two dislocation in a point @xmath75 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the partial local pressures induced by the first and the second dislocations , respectively . now repeating the calculations of the previous section with the pressure distribution ( [ pressure ] )",
    "one arrives at the total change of the exchange energy of the ferromagnetic caused by the two dislocation . then subtracting twice the self energy @xmath79 ( [ exch3 ] ) of the individual dislocations one may get the contribution of the exchange energy into the interaction between the dislocations , @xmath80 the signs correspond either to the same mechanical signs ( @xmath81 ) or to the opposite mechanical signs ( @xmath82 ) of the dislocations .",
    "the force due to the exchange interaction acting between the dislocations per their unit lengths is @xmath83 the exchange contribution to the interaction between the dislocations has the sign opposite to that of the elastic interaction .",
    "contrary to the elastic interaction , the exchange interaction results in an attraction of the dislocations with the same mechanical signs and a repulsion of the dislocations with the opposite signs .",
    "the elastic force between two parallel edge dislocations @xcite is @xmath84 therefore , the total force acting between the two dislocation is @xmath85 where @xmath50 is the same factor ( [ factor1 ] ) introduced in the previous section . if the configuration of the two dislocations is more complicated than that considered here , the expressions for the elastic and exchange contributions to the interaction will differ .",
    "however , we believe that the relation ( [ force3 ] ) will generally hold . hence , the discussion carried out in the previous section relates also to the forces acting between the dislocations .",
    "in conventional ferromagnetics the total force ( [ force3 ] ) nearly coincides with the elastic force ( [ force2 ] ) ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "however , in invars the interaction due to the exchange energy becomes anomalously strong at low temperatures and the factor @xmath50 may become essentially smaller than one .",
    "meaning that the total interaction between the dislocations becomes essentially smaller than the elastic one .",
    "the analysis of the interaction between dislocation creates a ground for discussing some specific features of deformation hardening in invar alloys .",
    "the deformation hardening in normal fcc metals and alloys is well studied ( see , e.g. , review @xcite ) . the hardening can be subdivided into three stages .",
    "the hardening rate @xmath87 in the second stage , usually called the rapid stage of the deformation hardening , is approximately ten times larger than the hardening rate in the first stage .",
    "that is why one can easily distinguish between them .",
    "the quantity @xmath87 hardly depends either on the temperature or on the alloy content .    according to the experiments @xcite non of these features hold in invar alloys .",
    "the hardening rate @xmath87 rapidly falls down with decreasing temperature and strongly depends on the alloy content . at low temperatures ( @xmath73 )",
    "its value is two to three times smaller than the value @xmath88 typical for conventional fcc alloys .",
    "therefore , the first and the second stages are separated not well enough .    the result of the previous two sections allow us to understand this drastic change of the behavior of the deformation hardening in invar alloys . the hardening rate @xmath87 is proportional to the interaction between dislocations in different sliding systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , accounting for the exchange contribution to the interaction between the dislocations , the hardening rate becomes @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the hardening rate caused by the elastic interaction only .",
    "as discussed above the factor @xmath91 is nearly one in conventional ferromagnetics , whereas in invars this factor becomes at low temperatures essentially smaller than one .",
    "@xmath91 in invars decreases with the decreasing temperature which should lead to a corresponding decrease of the deformation hardening rate @xmath87 .",
    "such a temperature dependence was really observed in @xcite . in case of the fe@xmath59ni@xmath60",
    "the factor @xmath91 can become as small as @xmath72 at @xmath92 , meaning that the hardening rate @xmath87 in the invar should be approximately three times smaller that its pure `` elastic '' value @xmath90 .    the exchange contribution to",
    "the dislocation interaction becomes negligible at temperatures above @xmath6 , meaning that @xmath87 measured at high temperatures is purely elastic one , @xmath93 .",
    "this allows us to use the experimental data ( above and below @xmath6 ) presented in references @xcite and estimate the ratio @xmath94 as lying in the range from 1/3 to 1/2 .",
    "it agrees very well with our theoretical estimate of the @xmath50 value .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 depends on the invar alloy content .",
    "even a slightest deviation from the typical content fe@xmath59ni@xmath60 causes a strong drop of the @xmath20 value and , hence , much stronger drop of the exchange effect contribution .",
    "just , for example , changing the ni concentration in this alloy from 35% to 38% results in a decrease of @xmath20 by a factor of two @xcite .",
    "then , according to ( [ factor2 ] ) , the coefficient @xmath50 changes from 0.35 to 0.84 .",
    "the exchange effects , as a result , are essentially suppressed and the deformation hardening rate in such an alloy is much closer to that of a normal alloy .",
    "the variation of the coefficient @xmath50 with the alloy content may provide an explanation of a strong dependence of the deformation hardening rate on the invar alloy content , observed in references @xcite .    in order to demonstrate it",
    ", we calculate the dependence of the deformation hardening rate @xmath87 on the concentration dependence in feni invar alloys ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "unfortunately the available experimental information is very limited .",
    "the value of the coefficient @xmath20 at room temperature is known only for the fe@xmath59ni@xmath60 alloy @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite provides the @xmath20 values for the ni concentrations , 34.7% and 44.9% , but only at low temperatures , 4.2 and 20.4 k. to the best of our knowledge there are no other data on the concentration dependence of this coefficient .",
    "that is why we assume the concentration dependence of @xmath20 measured in @xcite at low temperatures and scale it to the room temperature value of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this rather rough approximation can be readily improved when new data on the @xmath20 concentration dependence will appear .",
    "= 15    the choice of the remaining parameters is straightforward . the deformation hardening rate , @xmath90 , due to elastic strains is @xmath88 @xcite . the elastic constants @xmath95dyn/@xmath53 and @xmath96 do not depend on the alloy content at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the curie temperature for invar alloy is very high , so we may assume that the magnetization has arrived at saturation at room temperature , i.e. , @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "then using equations ( [ exch1 ] ) and ( [ factor1 ] ) one gets @xmath98 the dependence of the curie temperature on the alloy content is available in @xcite . then using equation ( [ hardening ] )",
    "we are able to calculate the concentration dependence of the deformation hardening @xmath87 for feni alloy presented by the solid line in figure 1 .",
    "the theory correctly predicts an increase of the deformation hardening with the increasing ni concentration .",
    "it is also in good quantitative agreement with the experiment for the fe@xmath59ni@xmath60 alloy for which we have reliable experimental value of the coefficient @xmath20 .",
    "we observe a rather strong deviation of the theory for the other ni contents where we have been forced to use less reliable values of @xmath20 , which may be the cause of this deviation .",
    "this calculation demonstrates a necessity of additional measurements of various characteristics of invar alloys with varying contents in order to verify the model proposed in this publication .",
    "this study demonstrates that the peculiar behavior of the deformation hardening of invars can not be explained by applying the conventional approach which considers only the elastic strain mediated interaction of dislocation .",
    "it is important to incorporate also the influence of the exchange effect on the interaction between dislocations which is anomalously strong in invars .",
    "the exchange mediated interaction between dislocations has the sign opposite to the elastic contribution and may essentially diminish the total interaction at temperatures well below the curie temperature .",
    "this decrease of the interaction is responsible for the lower rate of the deformation hardening in the second stage .",
    "this mechanism allows one also to explain the strong temperature and content dependence of the deformation hardening rate observed experimentally .",
    "an interesting case when the exchange interaction is so strong that it changes the sign of the total interaction needs a special attention and will be studied elsewhere .",
    "a more detailed experimental study of the temperature and content dependence of the deformation hardening rate in invars is necessary in order to verify the theoretical model developed in this paper .",
    "equations ( [ factor1 ] ) and ( [ hardening ] ) indicate that the temperature dependence of the deformation hardening rate @xmath99 is directly connected to temperature dependence of the invar magnetization @xmath44 .",
    "an experimental observation of such a connection would provide a strong support for our model ."
