    "warped extra dimensional models have become very popular because they are able to address simultaneously two intriguing issues within the standard model ( sm ) : the hierarchy problem and the mass / flavor problem .",
    "they were originally introduced to treat the first issue @xcite in a setup where the sm fields were all localized at one boundary of the extra dimension .",
    "later it was realized that by allowing fields to propagate into the bulk , different geographical localization of fields along the extra dimension could help explain the observed masses and flavor mixing among quarks and leptons @xcite .",
    "flavor bounds and precision electroweak tests put pressure on the mass scale of new physics in these models @xcite , but extending the gauge groups and/or matter content ( e.g. @xcite ) or by slightly modifying the spacetime warping of the metric ( e.g @xcite ) , it is possible to keep the new physics scale at the tev level at the reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking can still happen via a standard higgs mechanism in these scenarios ( although it can also be implemented as as pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) @xcite or described within the effective theory formalism @xcite ) . as the lhc announced the discovery of a light higgs - like particle of a mass around 125 gev @xcite , it becomes crucial to have a detailed prediction of the properties of the physical higgs particle in these models .",
    "the higgs boson itself must be located near the tev boundary of the extra dimension in order to solve the hierarchy problem , and so typically it is assumed to be exactly localized on that boundary ( brane higgs scenario ) . nevertheless , it is possible that it leaks out into the bulk ( bulk higgs scenario ) , and in doing so indirectly alleviate some of the bounds plaguing these models @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the production cross section of the brane higgs in these scenarios has been addressed before @xcite but we will pay close attention to the more recent works of @xcite .",
    "the towers of fermion kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes will affect significantly the sm prediction and in @xcite it was found that the higgs boson production rate can receive important corrections , either enhancing or suppressing the standard model prediction .",
    "the suppression or enhancement depends on the model parameters considered , in particular on the phases appearing in the different yukawa - type operators present in the 5d action .",
    "previously , the analysis of @xcite , in which only the first few modes were considered , gave no contribution to the rate from the towers of kk fermions .",
    "finally , the analysis of @xcite seems to indicate that with just a few kk modes a substantial effect is obtained , but of opposite sign as the one predicted from summing the infinite tower @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the effects of allowing the higgs boson to propagate in the bulk , with its profile more or less localized towards the ir brane depending on the value of the mass parameter @xmath0 , related to the bulk mass of the 5d higgs field .    to keep matters as simple as possible",
    "we will set up a model containing a single family of up - type 5d fermions along with a bulk higgs scalar .",
    "generalization to a more realistic scenario is straight forward but we prefer to stay as transparent as possible due to the many subtleties involved in the calculation .",
    "we first compute the contribution of the complete tower of kk fermions to the higgs production cross section as well as to the tree - level shift happening between the light fermion mass and its yukawa coupling ( leading to flavor violating couplings when considering three fermion families ) . these calculations ,",
    "as outlined in @xcite , are analytically straightforward and allow us to obtain simple and compact results .",
    "we then repeat the same analysis numerically from the point of view of an effective theory in which only the first few kk fermions contribute .",
    "we show that for a bulk higgs with a thickness of the order of inverse tev scale , the results obtained are the same as the results obtained by summing the complete kk tower ( i.e. heavier modes decouple )",
    ". moreover , these results are consistent with the predictions obtained in @xcite for the specific case of a brane localized higgs .",
    "the two aproaches outlined seem to give different predictions as the bulk higgs is continuously pushed towards the brane .",
    "it turns out that in order to maintain the consistency of both approaches we need to include in the analysis the effects of a special type of higher order operators . after these effects are included",
    ", we will come back and address in the discussion section the differences among the existing calculations in the literature and stress the importance of including the mentioned higher order operators in the analysis .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we consider the simplest 5d warped extension of the sm , in which we keep the sm local gauge groups and just extend the space - time by one warped extra dimension .",

    "the fermions are expected to propagate in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the up - sector fermion action that we consider is therefore & & s_fermion = d^4x dz ,  with @xmath9 being the covariant derivative , and we have added a yukawa interaction with a higgs field @xmath10 which in principle can be either brane or bulk localized . from the 5d fermion mass terms one defines dimensionless parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 which are _ a priori _ quantities of @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 have inverse energy units ( @xmath15 ) since yukawa couplings in 5d are higher dimensional operators .    after separating 5d fields into left and right chiralities",

    "thus , if we choose @xmath25 , the zero mode wavefunctions are localized towards the uv brane ; if @xmath26 , they are localized towards the ir brane .    in order to implement minimally the higgs sector out of a 5d scalar we use the following action @xcite @xmath27 - v_{uv}(h)\\delta(z - r ) - v_{ir}(h)\\delta ( z - r'),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the 5d mass for the higgs boson .",
    "the boundary potentials @xmath29 and @xmath30 yield boundary conditions that can accommodate electroweak symmetry breaking , so that one obtains a higgs vev with a non - trivial profile along the extra - dimension . around that vev",
    ", one should then add perturbations and obtain the spectrum of physical modes , i.e. a sm - like higgs boson and a tower of kk higgs fields .",
    "the expansion should look like h(x , z)= v_(z ) + h_(z ) h(x ) + .... , and we can choose the boundary conditions such that the profile of the higgs vev @xmath31 takes the simple form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the sm higgs boson vev .",
    "one should note that the wave function @xmath36 of the light physical higgs ( lightest kk higgs field ) will have the form h_(z)=",
    "( 1+o ( ) ) , [ hvsv ] so that for a light enough higgs boson mass both profiles @xmath36 and @xmath31 are aligned ( i.e. proportional to each other ) .",
    "the previous bulk higgs sector is capable of reproducing the brane higgs limit , since the wavefunction of the light higgs ( and its vev ) both depend exponentially on the parameter @xmath0 . as this parameter",
    "is increased , the wavefunctions are pushed more and more towards the ir brane mimicking a perfectly localized higgs sector .",
    "parameter and so these fields will decouple from the theory for very large @xmath0 . ] indeed , the wave function of the higgs can act as a brane localizer since _ h^2(z ) = _ v^2(z ) = ( z - r ) , where the dirac delta function is defined as the limit of a sequence of functions with increasing value of @xmath0 . one can easily prove that for any wavefunction @xmath37 ( or a product of wavefunctions ) we have _",
    "_ r^r^+h^2(z ) f(z ) dz = f(r ) .",
    "there is however an issue about localizing the whole higgs sector towards the brane since we just showed that only quadratic higgs operators will `` become '' brane localizers . when a 5d action operator contains more than two ( or less than two ) higgs fields , the ( successful ) localization of such operators is not guaranteed .",
    "in fact in order to ensure that the 5d bulk higgs scenario correctly tends smoothly to a fully localized higgs sector , one should implement a prescription enforcing a precise @xmath0 dependence on the coefficients of all operators containing higgs fields .",
    "more precisely , the coefficient @xmath38 of an operator containing @xmath39 higgs fields ( before electroweak symmetry breaking ) should behave as y^n()= y^n_1^ , where @xmath40 .",
    "this is the only way to ensure that we can have _ _",

    "f(r ) ,   or in other words _ y^n ( )",
    "h^n(z ) = y^n_1  ( z - r ) .",
    "in particular for 5d yukawa type couplings this prescription implies that the 5d yukawa coupling will have to carry a @xmath41 dependence in order to ensure that the brane limit yukawa coupling is non - vanishing @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "but it also means that any other 5d action operator containing a single higgs field would need to carry the same @xmath41 dependence .",
    "on the other hand , 5d action operators containing 3 higgs fields ( like the operator @xmath42 ) would have a diverging limit for @xmath0 large unless its action coefficient @xmath43 is itself suppressed by @xmath44 .",
    "the previous prescription makes it technically possible to define a localized higgs sector from a 5d bulk higgs field , but it certainly seems quite contrived to appropriately fix all operator coefficients such that they all can give non - zero and finite contributions when the higgs is localized .",
    "a brane localized higgs sector could seem `` un - generic '' or `` un - natural '' if it is to be seen as a limiting case of a bulk higgs .",
    "more details about the complete prescription for operators containing higgs fields are presented in appendix [ apen : ii ] .",
    "for completeness and consistency , we present first a result previously obtained in @xcite , namely the computation of the shift between the light sm fermion mass term and its yukawa coupling with the higgs field ( leading to higgs mediated fcnc when more than one fermion family is considered ) .",
    "we then calculate the coupling between the physical higgs and two gluons for the 5d bulk higgs case .",
    "we can follow two routes to obtain our predictions .",
    "the computation of the flavor violating couplings of the higgs scalar with fermions will be obtained in an approach based on considering _ first _ electroweak symmetry breaking and _ then _ solving the 5d equations of motion for the fermions ( i.e. the effect of the higgs vev is directly taken into account in the equations of motion and during the dimensional reduction procedure ) .",
    "the alternative ( and equivalent ) approach would be to consider _ first _ the dimensional reduction ( i.e. obtain the 4d effective theory in the gauge basis ) , and _ then _ consider the electroweak symmetry breaking in the presence of the infinite tower of kk fermions .",
    "after performing the diagonalization of the infinite fermion mass matrix ( as well as canonical normalization of the fermion kinetic terms ) we should recover the same results .",
    "we use the first approach in the first subsection , and the second approach in the computation of the higgs coupling to gluons and also in the following sections where we will truncate the infinite mass matrix in order to consider only the effect of the first few kk modes .      after imposing electroweak symmetry breaking in the higgs sector , the four profiles @xmath45 and @xmath46 introduced in eqs .",

    "( [ hggyu ] ) , and sum up to the maximum number of kk modes desired .",
    "we perform the sum numerically and show the results in figure [ fig : cggh ] .",
    "again we are interested in the variation of the couplings with @xmath0 and compare them to the result for the @xmath84 obtained by calculating the infinite sum , as shown in the previous section .",
    "the two panels of the figure show the contribution to the @xmath54 coupling coming from a 5d up - like quark ( left panel ) and the contribution coming from a 5d top - like quark ( right panel ) for @xmath0 values up to 100 .",
    "we can see how the sums over different maximum number of kk modes converge to the infinite sum limit as we vary @xmath0 .",
    "the approximation obtained by considering just a few kk modes is much better for low values of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , from the left panel of figure [ fig : cggh ] , for @xmath97 , 8 kk modes saturate some 90% of the infinite sum , while for @xmath98 , 8 kk modes saturate some 60% of the infinite sum . for @xmath99 ( corresponding to a higgs highly localized towards the brane ) ,",
    "8 kk modes represent only some 10% of the total kk contribution .",
    "this dependence on @xmath0 is in agreement with the results found in @xcite , in which a brane localized higgs was considered ( i.e. @xmath100 ) and the first few kk fermions considered were found to give a negligible contribution to the @xmath54 coupling .",
    "+ we conclude that in all the previous calculations ( the top quark yukawa shift and the contributions to the @xmath54 coupling coming from up - type and top - like 5d quarks ) we have observed the same feature , namely that in the case of a bulk higgs ( small @xmath0 ) , the effect of the heavier kk modes decouples ( i.e. performing the infinite sum is equivalent to sum only over the first few kk modes ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath0 is very large , the heavier degrees of freedom do not seem to decouple hinting towards some type of uv sensitivity of the brane higgs case .",
    "this is not that surprising since the thickness of a higgs being crushed against the brane is becoming smaller and smaller , and the scale associated with the higgs localization eventually becomes much larger than the cut - off of the scenario .",
    "we will now see how adding a type of higher derivative operators will be sufficient to make the finite sums consistent with the infinite sum results obtained earlier .",
    "we have just seen how the results obtained in the previous section ( [ sec : individual ] ) , where we sum over a few kk modes agree with the complete kk tower summation of section [ sec : infinite ] only in the case of a bulk higgs boson .",
    "when the higgs is on the brane , or very much pushed towards the brane , the results for the two approaches do not seem to agree ( see figure [ fig : cggh ] when @xmath101 ) .",
    "we will reconcile the two methods by including , in the effective theory calculation , the contribution of higher derivative operators .",
    "in particular we consider the effect of the following operator in the action with a dimensionful coupling constant @xmath102 ( flavor indices are suppressed ) , s d^4x dz .",
    "the operator is of yukawa - type as it couples two fermions with the higgs , but it involves derivatives of fields .",
    "the coupling @xmath102 should be in units of @xmath103 , the cut - off of the theory , and so obviously this operator is cut - off suppressed ( we note that the standard 5d yukawa @xmath48 coupling is also dimensionfull and cut - off suppressed , but by two units less than @xmath102 ) . since @xmath104 and @xmath105 satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions on the ir brane , their derivatives along the extra dimension can be large after electroweak symmetry breaking and so we focus on the operator s d^4x dz ( rz)^3 , [ r ] which includes only the @xmath106 chirality fermion components @xmath104 and @xmath105 as it could lead to potentially large effects .    as explained in the previous sections we can proceed in two ways in order to compute the effects of this operator .",
    "we could study the effect of the operator into the 5d equations of motion _ after _ electroweak symmetry breaking ( esb ) and calculate its effects from these .",
    "alternatively , we could solve the equations of motion and perform the dimensional reduction _ before _",
    "esb , and then consider the effects produced by the operator by working in this gauge eigenbasis .",
    "both methods should be equivalent , but we will follow the second one . in this approach , we obtain the effective 4d theory and since it is non - renormalizable , we cut - off its spectrum at the cut - off scale thus effectively we only allow a few physical kk modes into the calculation .",
    "the effects from higher modes are integrated out and encoded in all higher order operators of the theory with their effects under control by the cut - off suppression . in the case of the @xmath102 operator",
    "the potentially large derivatives of @xmath104 and @xmath105 can offset the cut - off suppression and so we should keep this operator in the calculations .    in the approach in which the kk modes are in the gauge basis , the @xmath102 operator will affect the fermion mass matrix from eq .",
    "( [ infinitem ] ) , and in particular it will contribute to the @xmath107 terms .",
    "( relative to the standard model ) as a function of the higgs localization parameter @xmath0 when considering _ only _ a five - dimensional up - type quark , and computed with the higher derivative term discussed in the text in addition to the standard 5d yukawa coupling term .",
    "since both contributions have independent phases we add and subtract their generic size to obtain the shaded region of possible values .",
    "these results are calculated by using only the first 3 kk modes ( i.e. considering an effective theory with a cut - off of the order the the fourth kk mass ) .",
    "the dimensionless 5d yukawas are fixed at @xmath55 and the kk scale is set at @xmath56 gev ( the overall effect scales as @xmath57).,height=302 ]    @xmath108{ramanshifttop.pdf } & \\includegraphics[width=3.5in , height=7cm]{ramanhggtop.pdf } \\end{array}$ ]    its effects can therefore be tracked into the effects of these _ wrong _ chirality terms , as was already noted in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "we can thus formally treat the situation as before , where a truncated version of the infinite mass matrix of eq .",
    "( [ infinitem ] ) is considered ( with just a few kk levels ) , but now we redefine the terms @xmath107 to include the contributions from @xmath102 as y_u_lq_r^u = _ r^rdz(rz)^5 ( y^u u_l(z)q_r(z ) + y_r^u z^2r^2 _ zu_l(z)_zq_r(z ) ) .",
    "it is now easy to compute numerically the new effects since from here we just have to repeat the previous procedure .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ rl ] and [ rh ] . in both figures",
    "we show the individual contributions coming from the normal yukawa coupling @xmath109 , from the new @xmath110 coupling , as well as the combined effect .",
    "this combined effect is represented by the shaded region , the reason being that the two types of couplings @xmath109 and @xmath110 have independent phases and so can add up constructively or destructively , or in between . in figure [ rl ]",
    "we focus on the contribution to @xmath54 due to an up - like 5d quark . in figure [ rh ]",
    "we show the predictions for the both shift in the sm top quark yukawa coupling as well as the prediction for the contribution to the @xmath54 coupling coming from a 5d top - like quark .",
    "as we can see , the shift in the top quark yukawa coupling can be quite large , and for low values of the higgs localization parameter @xmath0 the shift obtained always results in a suppression in the yukawa coupling . for large values of @xmath0",
    "the shift can be in either direction ( suppression or enhancement ) . in the case of the @xmath54 coupling",
    ", we see that the contribution represents an enhancement with respect to the sm prediction for small values of @xmath0 , and again for large values of @xmath0 the @xmath84 coupling can be either enhanced or suppressed depending on the relative phases between @xmath102 and @xmath109 . for this comparison",
    "we have taken the absolute value of both couplings @xmath102 and @xmath109 to be the same , i.e. @xmath55 , in appropriate units of the cutoff .",
    "the main feature to remember is that the effects of the higher derivative operator @xmath102 are subdominant for small @xmath0 but become dominant for large @xmath0 .",
    "the large contribution obtained at large @xmath0 is precisely what makes these new predictions consistent with the results obtained with the original infinite sum , and so the higher derivative operators that we have considered here somewhat encode the uv sensitivity found in the previous section .",
    "in this section we present a discussion on how to treat the case where the higgs profile is different form its vev profile .",
    "this is equivalent to consider the mixing effects between the massless zero mode higgs boson , and the heavy kk higgs modes and its effects on the higgs observables computed in this paper .",
    "we follow closely an argument by azatov @xcite and for simplicity we will discuss a simple situation in which the 4d effective theory contains only two new heavy vector - like fermions , @xmath62 and @xmath91 , doublet and singlet of @xmath3 respectively .",
    "this is the situation one would have when the kk fermion towers are truncated after the first kk excitation .",
    "let s first define our notation for the following quantities y^_ijdz()^5 _",
    "i  _ j + x^_ijdz()^5 _ i  _ j  h_(z ) , where @xmath35 is the sm higgs vev and @xmath111 are the 5d profiles of the higgs vev and the higgs physical field , which are generically different .",
    "that is , after ewsb , the higgs field is expanded around the nontrivial vev @xmath31 as h(x , z)=v_(z ) + h(x ) h_(z ) + ... . in the case of the bulk higgs sector",
    "considered here , both profiles @xmath111 are almost the same , ( see eq .",
    "( [ hvsv ] ) ) , the order of the misalignment between them being controlled by powers of @xmath112 ( a small quantity ) .",
    "we consider all the possible couplings between the higgs and the fermions of the effective theory which after ewsb can be written as the matrix @xmath113 as (|q_l,|q_l|u_l )  ( y^_q_lu_r  v_4 + x^_q_lu_r h(x ) & 0 & y^_q_lu_r  v_4 + x^_q_lu_rh(x ) + y^_q_lu_r  v_4 + x^_q_lu_rh(x ) & m_q & y^_q_lu_r  v_4 + x^_q_lu_rh(x ) + 0 & y^_u_lq_r  v_4 + x^_u_lq_rh(x ) & m_u ) (u_r + q_r + u_r ) ,   the coupling between the physical higgs and the two gluons is controlled by the physical yukawa couplings @xmath114 and masses @xmath115 of the heavier physical fermions running in the loop ( top quark and kk modes ) , i.e. _ heavy = tr(*y*_phys * m*_phys^-1)-_light , where @xmath116 is the physical yukawa coupling and @xmath117 is the physical fermion mass matrix of the setup .",
    "because the trace is invariant under unitary transformations , we can rotate to the gauge basis and write tr(*y*_phys*m*_phys^-1 ) = tr(*y*_gauge*m*_gauge^-1 ) , and note that we can now relate this to the matrix @xmath113 as tr(*y*_gauge*m*_gauge^-1 ) = _",
    "h(det m(v_4,h))|_h=0 .",
    "the procedure is the same as was followed in section [ sec : infinite ] , i.e. we compute the the determinant by expanding in powers of @xmath118 and after combining everything we obtain _",
    "heavy&=&_hdet m(v_4,h)- + & = & v_4(-- ) .",
    "this result is the equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) with the effect of the misalignment between @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "one sees that the difference lies in the substitution of one of the @xmath119 terms by an @xmath120 term , and so the correction to the result of eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) is = v_4(-- ) , which is controlled by ( x^_u_lq_r - y^_u_lq_r)= dz()^5 u_l(z)q_r(z ) ( h_(z)- ) ,   and ( x^_q_lu_r - y^_q_lu_r)= dz()^5 q_l(z)u_r(z ) ( h_(z)- ) ,   and since the misalignment between @xmath31 and @xmath36 can be computed perturbatively @xcite as h_(z)-= ( + + o(m_h^4r^4 ) ) , we obtain ( x^_u_lq_r - y^_u_lq_r ) = m_h^2 r^2 ( + ) + o(m_h^4r^4 ) . in other words ,",
    "the effect of considering the misalignment between @xmath31 and @xmath36 is to add a correction with the same structure as the result of eq .",

    "in this work we have presented the results for the predictions of higgs phenomenology in a toy - model rs setup in which the higgs field is allowed to propagate in the bulk and with a single 5d fermion field .",
    "our results can be extended to three families to include full flavor effects , but the generic predictions that we would obtain are expected to be basically the same as the ones presented in @xcite .",
    "that is , that in the context of flavor anarchy , where the action parameters are all of the same order but with more or less random values and phases ( with the constraint of obtaining correct sm predictions ) the couplings of the higgs with fermions and gluons and photons can receive important corrections , either enhancing or suppressing the sm predictions .",
    "however , the two references mentioned present calculations performed by including the effect of all the kk fermions , technically assuming an infinite cut - off for the model ( where a brane higgs is considered ) .",
    "in general , all these scenarios break down at a low cut - off , becoming strongly coupled for both gauge and yukawa interactions .",
    "the implicit assumption made in @xcite was that the effects of the heavier modes should decouple quickly , at least for the case of a bulk higgs field .",
    "the main motivation to perform the calculations by considering the full infinite fermion kk tower , as well as pushing the higgs into the brane was mainly of technical nature .",
    "indeed both the flavor structure of the higgs yukawa couplings as well as the coupling to gluons and photons can be computed analytically with those ingredients . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors checked analytically that the corrections to the higgs yukawa couplings were actually of the same order for a bulk higgs and a brane higgs .",
    "however it was pointed out in @xcite that in the brane higgs case , the effects of the heavier kk fermion modes do not decouple and that they all contribute evenly in the computation of the higgs couplings in the model . on the other hand , we showed in sections [ sec : infinite ] and [ sec : individual ] of this paper that the heavier kk modes in the case of a bulk higgs do decouple very quickly , so that the analytical result obtained by using the infinite kk tower approaches with great precision the numerical result obtained by considering an effective theory with only a few kk fermion modes . moreover , when considering the effective theory with only a few kk modes , one should include in the action all possible operators and in particular the higher derivative ones introduced in section [ sec : ramanop ] .",
    "these effects were omitted in @xcite , and as we showed in this work , the importance of these operators increases as the higgs is more and more localized towards the brane . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered an rs setup with a highly localized higgs and the presence of only a few kk fermions and studied the effects on the higgs couplings to gluons and photons , among other observables . in the limit of the sm gauge group ( they did consider an extended gauge group ) they found no significant deviations from the sm predictions . indeed",
    "this result is consistent with our findings of section [ sec : individual ] ( no higher derivative operators invoked yet ) , since as it can be seen on figures [ rh ] and [ rl ] , the shift in higgs yukawa couplings and the new effects to higgs - gluon - gluon coupling vanish in the limit of highly localized higgs ( large @xmath0 parameter ) .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite it is claimed that large effects should be present in the case of a brane higgs and with only a few kk modes present in the effective theory ( and no higher derivative operators ) , a result inconsistent with both our findings and those found in @xcite .",
    "we can trace the origin of the disagreement in their calculation of the higgs yukawa couplings .",
    "those are computed by using the full 5d equations of motion , which as we have said earlier is equivalent to considering the complete tower of kk modes .",
    "then , using these couplings , they calculate the @xmath54 radiative coupling but now including only a finite amount of kk fermions .",
    "this treatment leads to a highly suppressed top quark yukawa coupling ( due to effects from the infinite kk tower ) and a vanishing contribution to @xmath54 from the loops of kk fermions considered ( one would need the whole tower to obtain a finite effect ) .",
    "their end result is a suppressed top quark yukawa coupling and a suppressed @xmath54 coupling ( due to the smaller top quark yukawa ) , predictions which are at odds with the findings of @xcite and of this paper .",
    "the procedure of @xcite seems inconsistent because essentially the authors use infinite kk degrees of freedom in one part of their calculation ( the sm quark yukawa couplings computation via equations of motion ) but then they truncate the kk degrees of freedom in order to compute the @xmath54 coupling . in any case , had they included the higher derivative operators introduced in this paper , their results would have changed dramatically since then , the effect to @xmath54 coming from the top quark yukawa loop would remain basically the same , but the effects due to loops of a few kk fermions would dominate the overall effect ( and thus the result would start to become consistent with the findings of @xcite ) .    also , the predictions of @xcite should change if one considers the effects of the higher derivative operators introduced in section [ sec : ramanop ] .",
    "in that situation , the higgs couplings can receive large corrections , and can be of any sign ( suppression or enhancement ) due to the different phases present in the couplings @xmath119 and @xmath102 .",
    "in fact we have found here that for a higgs field in the bulk , our results are more predictive than for a brane higgs field , because the effect of the higher derivativer operators is subdominant for a bulk higgs field .",
    "the effects from only the 5d yukawa operators are aligned @xcite , and thus all the kk quarks add up in phase .",
    "in that situation we can have definite predictions for the effects caused by a single family of fermions , i.e. it will produce a suppression in the light quark yukawa coupling and an enhancement in higgs boson production ( as well as suppression in the higgs to photons coupling ) @xcite , with the caveat of taking the dimensionless couplings of both yukawa terms and higher derivative operators to be the same ( consistent with the usual assumption that all 5d coefficients have to be of the same order ) .",
    "taking into account the three fermion families in conjunction with a bulk higgs field might weaken this prediction due to complicated flavor mixings and structure , but still one should be able to draw a correlation between yukawa couplings and higgs production ( and @xmath126 ) for the case of a bulk higgs field .",
    "the parameter space of the bulk higgs scenario can therefore be under a tighter pressure as more and more precise experimental measurements in higgs observables at the lhc become available .",
    "in particular if the predicted and correlated deviations of higgs couplings is not clearly observed this should put bounds on the kk scale of the bulk higgs scenario .",
    "the situation for a higgs on the brane is different .",
    "the higher order derivative terms are now important .",
    "each kk tower of light quarks and the top will contribute to the @xmath54 coupling , but their effect depends on arbitrary relative phases ( between @xmath102 and @xmath127 ) , and so one can not make a firm statement about the magnitude and phase of the overall contribution : it can be a suppression or an enhancement , or in between .",
    "finally we comment again on the apparent problem of a highly localized higgs scenario ( brane higgs ) in which predictions made from a truncated fermion kk tower are very different from predictions made from an infinite fermion kk tower .",
    "this apparent uv - sensitivity can actually be lifted by considering the higher derivative operators described here ( first introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "when these are included , the predictions made with a finite kk fermion tower become consistent with the original predictions obtained with an infinite fermion tower .",
    "a more esthetic problem with the brane higgs scenario remains , since the definition of the higgs operators seems highly unnatural , if one understands a brane higgs field as a limit of a bulk higgs field .",
    "all operators involving higgs fields will have to have a precise and definite dependence on @xmath0 ( a large number ) , which seems quite contrived , specially in a framewrok in which no big numerical hierarchies should arise from fundamental 5d coefficients . in any case , with the ansatz outlined in the text and reviewed in appendix [ apen : ii ] , one can still work consistently with a brane higgs field as a limit case of a bulk higgs field .",
    "would like to thank kaustubh agashe for many discussions and comments and specially alex azatov and lijun zhu for their invaluable help and collaboration in the early stages of this work . this work is supported in part by nserc under grant number sap105354 .",

    "<S> in the context of warped extra - dimensional models with all fields propagating in the bulk , we address the phenomenology of a bulk scalar higgs boson , and calculate its production cross section at the lhc as well as its tree - level effects on mediating flavor changing neutral currents . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the calculations based on two different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> first , we compute our predictions analytically by considering all the degrees of freedom emerging from the dimensional reduction ( the infinite tower of kaluza klein modes ( kk ) ) . in the second approach </S>",
    "<S> , we perform our calculations numerically by considering only the effects caused by the first few kk modes , present in the 4-dimensional effective theory . in the case of a higgs leaking far from the brane , </S>",
    "<S> both approaches give the same predictions as the effects of the heavier kk modes decouple . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the higgs boson is pushed towards the tev brane , the two approaches seem to be equivalent only when one includes heavier and heavier degrees of freedom ( which do not seem to decouple ) . to reconcile these results </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to introduce a type of higher derivative operator which essentially encodes the effects of integrating out the heavy kk modes and dresses the brane higgs so that it looks just like a bulk higgs .     + </S>"
