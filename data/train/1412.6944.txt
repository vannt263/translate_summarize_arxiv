    "geometric frustration on a lattice is the inability to consistently satisfy all pair - wise spin interactions between lattice sites as defined by a hamiltonian .",
    "the most common example of geometric frustration is the classical nearest - neighbour antiferromagnetic ( nnaf ) ising model on a triangular lattice in two dimensions.@xcite this seemingly simple case does not show magnetic order down to the lowest temperature , but instead exhibits a finite entropy at @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , the more general or complex case , with the ising - spins replaced by spin 1/2 heisenberg - spins has been shown to exhibit an ordered ground state , which corresponds to the quantum analogue of the classical neel ground state.@xcite this may be compared with another case of frustration - induced zero - point entropy and absence of ordering , namely , the quantum spin - liquid known for the @xmath18 kagome lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet.@xcite these contradictory results i.e. presence or absence of ordering , typify the uncertain role of frustration in two dimensional systems with triangular plaquettes .",

    ".    although the triangular plaquette is the smallest unit with intrinsic frustration , any larger plaquette with an odd number of edges ( or vertices ) would also naturally give rise to frustration .",
    "in particular , a pentagonal plaquette also leads to frustration .",
    "while a regular pentagonal plaquette can not form a bravais lattice , there are 14 known pentagonal tesselations based on irregular pentagons .",
    "early studies@xcite discussed frustration effects for the two - dimensional pentagonal lattice obtained from the hexagonal lattice by cutting each hexagon into halves with parallel lines(fig . 1 of ref . 12 ) .",

    "this indicates a first - order transition as a function of @xmath5 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the order parameter plots as a function of @xmath5 indicate an antiferromagnetic phase for @xmath66 , which transforms into a ferrimagnetic phase for @xmath67 .",

    "thus , in the limit @xmath100 , we have isolated dimers on the 3-co - ordinated sites while for @xmath101 , we retain the ferrimagnetism .    the ferrimagnetic phase obtained for @xmath67 with a total magnetization @xmath102 , is identical to earlier studies from ( i ) exact calculations for the ising@xcite , ( ii ) hard - core bosons@xcite and ( iii ) the heisenberg@xcite models .",
    "it is noted that , for the antiferromagnetic phase , the sub - lattice magnetization @xmath103 = @xmath95 for @xmath66 , ( see fig . [ fig3](a ) ) due to the fact that out of its 4 nearest - neighbour sites , two sites have up - spins and two have down - spins .",

    "we now turn to investigating the role of selective exchange coupling at @xmath104 .",
    "we carry out this exercise mainly to identify the role of specific couplings of the 3- and 4-co - ordinated sites in the cairo lattice , and to effectively simulate virtual dopings of x = 1/6 and 1/3 . from the way we have defined our couplings ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : couplings ] ) ) , it can be observed that if we set @xmath105 , the central spin @xmath37 gets disconnected from the lattice .",
    "consequently , the central spin @xmath37 does not participate in the magnetic ordering and the system effectively represents a virtual hole doping content of @xmath106 . in the same way , it can be observed that when @xmath107 , the spins @xmath108 and @xmath109 get disconnected , corresponding to a virtual hole doping of @xmath110 .",
    "our results indicate that for both these cases , the system is antiferromagnetic for all @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath96 . for @xmath111 , the sub - lattice magnetizations are exactly the same as those for @xmath112 ( fig . [ fig3 ] ) , and we therefore refrain from showing these plots in a figure . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the actual magnetic structure gets modified as discussed below .",
    "another important difference from the @xmath57 case is that @xmath113 for both values of @xmath90 and @xmath13 and is independent of @xmath5 , indicating the absence of frustration .",
    "the absence of a @xmath5-driven transition for the cases @xmath114 is easy to understand . in the @xmath106 case ,",
    "the central spin @xmath37 does not participate in the magnetic ordering .",
    "the remaining spins can be looked upon as forming a  star \" configuration with 12 bonds on its periphery , all of which can be satisfied in the antiferomagnetic phase , thus removing frustration fully .",
    "an increase of @xmath5 only strengthens the antiferromagnetic order , increasing @xmath31 ( see fig .",

    "the remaining spins can be looked upon as forming a  boat \" configuration with 10 bonds on its periphery , all of which can be satisfied in the antiferomagnetic phase , again fully removing frustration(fig .",
    "an increase of @xmath5 in this case also , merely strengthens the antiferromagnetic order by increasing @xmath31 . while both the @xmath106 and @xmath110 cases exhibit antiferromagnetic order , the actual spin ordering is found to be different : the former corresponds to a repetition of",
    " star\"(fig .",

    "1(d ) ) unit cells .     as a function of @xmath5 for x = 0 , 1/6 and 1/3 .",
    "a jump in the ordering temperature is seen only for x = 0 at @xmath59 . in ( b ) we present a magnified view of the region near @xmath116 . ]    in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) , we plot the sub - lattice magnetizations @xmath117 for the undoped case ( @xmath57 ) , as a function of temperature in units of @xmath21 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , i.e. in the antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic phases , respectively .",
    "we find that the transition temperature @xmath118 and @xmath119(the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic transition temperatures , respectively ) for destruction of magnetic order primarily depends on @xmath5 .",
    "this is further borne out by the temperature - dependence plots for @xmath106 presented in figs . [ fig5](a ) and [ fig5](b ) for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the temperature - dependence plots for @xmath110 , presented in figs .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and [ fig6](b ) for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , also reflect this .",
    "in particular , @xmath119 increases on increasing @xmath5 for @xmath90 and @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the ordering temperatures increase smoothly with @xmath5 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , where we plot @xmath118 and @xmath31 as a function of @xmath5 for the three cases @xmath120 .",
    "the discontinuity at the first - order transition for @xmath57 at @xmath93 is quite clear and remarkable . in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) , we present a magnified view of the plot around @xmath93 .",
    "we can also see in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) that the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath2 is negligible for all @xmath66 . but for @xmath67 , while the @xmath114 plots follow the same course as @xmath66 , the @xmath57 curve follows a completely different course because of the discontinuity .",
    "the larger @xmath31 of the antiferromagnetic phase compared to the @xmath118 of the ferrimagnetic phase , just above @xmath93 , suggests a higher stability of the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "however , for @xmath5 values greater than @xmath121 , the ferrimagnetic @xmath118 for @xmath57 becomes larger than the antiferromagnetic @xmath31 for @xmath90 and @xmath13 .",
    "the results also show that @xmath31 goes to a finite value as @xmath99 , but increases linearly for high @xmath5 .",
    "we now describe the physical picture of the various phases obtained by varying the model parameters .",
    "firstly , the crucial role that frustration plays in the @xmath5-driven first - order transition is seen from the results of the @xmath60 case . in the @xmath57 antiferromagnet region",
    "obtained for @xmath66 , the frustration is confined to the core of the unit cell ,",
    "i.e. two out of the four @xmath122-bonds ( either the @xmath123 or the @xmath124 bonds ) connecting to the central spin @xmath37 are frustrated ; in this situation , the frustration measure @xmath125 is an increasing function of @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath8 ) . with further increase in @xmath5 beyond @xmath126 , it becomes energetically favorable to  eject \" the frustration from the core to the @xmath21 bonds lying on the periphery of the unit cell i.e. the the four @xmath21-bonds connecting 3-co - ordinated sites become frustrated . thus , the @xmath5-driven transition is attended by a change in the location of the frustrated bonds in the unit cell . secondly , it is surprising to find that the obtained @xmath119 values do not depend on @xmath2 but only on @xmath5 . however , experimental results have also indicated that @xmath31 does not depend significantly on doping content .",
    "for example , studies on bi@xmath14fe@xmath15o@xmath16(@xmath127bife@xmath14o@xmath128 ; nominal valency of  fe@xmath129 ) , the material recently recognized as a realization of the cairo pentagonal lattice , reported a @xmath130  k for single crystals@xcite , while for polycrystals , @xmath31 was reported to be @xmath131  k.@xcite for mixed valent polycrystalline bife@xmath14o@xmath17 with a nominal valency of fe@xmath25 , which corresponds to a hole doping of @xmath132 , retuerto et al . reported a value of @xmath133",
    "k.@xcite further , for @xmath90 and @xmath13 , since the magnetic structures have no frustration , the zero temperature free energy @xmath134 .",
    "however , the two magnetic structures have different values of @xmath135 . from eq.([eq : isingunitcell ] ) , we obtain @xmath136 for @xmath90 , and @xmath137 for x = 1/3 .",
    "thus , even with different values of the ground state energies for @xmath90 and @xmath13 , our results suggest that @xmath31 depends only on @xmath5 = @xmath6 .    finally ,",
    "the present results also show that the absolute values of the sub - lattice magnetizations at high temperatures(@xmath138/@xmath118 to @xmath31/@xmath118 ) ) depend on the co - ordination of the sites and the value of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , as can be seen in fig .",
    "4(a ) for @xmath60 and @xmath69 , the absolute values of sub - lattice magnetizations of the 3-co - ordinated sites @xmath139 are exactly the same , but for @xmath140 to @xmath31 , they are slightly lower than @xmath62 , which is a 4-co - ordinated site . similarly , for the ferrimagnetic phase with @xmath70 , fig .",
    "4(b ) shows that absolute values of @xmath139(3-co - ordinated sites ) are exactly the same , but for @xmath141 to @xmath118 , they are lower than @xmath65 and @xmath62 which are 4-co - ordinated sites .",
    "this was also pointed out by urumov for the ferrimagnetic phase using an exact calculation , although the changes were very small.@xcite for @xmath106 , the changes are the same as for @xmath57 and @xmath69 , but the difference between 3 and 4-co - ordinated sites get enhanced on increasing @xmath142 . very interestingly ,",
    "we see the opposite behaviour for @xmath143 compared to @xmath111 . for @xmath69(fig .",
    "6(a ) ) , due to selective exchange coupling , the structurally 4-co - ordinated sites become magnetically 2-co - ordinated sites(see fig .",
    "1(d ) ) , and consequently , the absolute values of @xmath65 and @xmath62 get suppressed compared to @xmath61 and @xmath144(structurally and magnetically 3-cordinated sites ) for temperatures between @xmath145 to @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath70 , the difference between absolute values of @xmath65 , @xmath62 compared to @xmath61 , @xmath144 become smaller as the magnetization profiles get dominated by the larger value of @xmath20 compared to @xmath21 .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the spin @xmath0 = @xmath1 cairo pentagonal lattice with respect to selective exchange coupling , in a nearest - neighbour antiferromagnetic ising model .",
    "we have developed a simple method to quantify geometric frustration in terms of a frustration index @xmath4 , where @xmath5 = @xmath6 , the ratio of the two exchange couplings required by the symmetry of the cairo lattice . at @xmath7",

    "<S> the cairo pentagonal lattice , consisting of an irregular pentagonal tiling of magnetic ions on two inequivalent sites ( 3- and 4-co - ordinated ones ) , represents a fascinating example for studying geometric frustration effects in two - dimensions . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the spin @xmath0 = @xmath1 cairo pentagonal lattice with respect to selective exchange coupling ( which effectively corresponds to a virtual doping of @xmath2 = @xmath3 ) , in a nearest - neighbour antiferromagnetic ising model . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop a simple method to quantify geometric frustration in terms of a frustration index @xmath4 , where @xmath5 = @xmath6 , the ratio of the two exchange couplings required by the symmetry of the cairo lattice . at @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , the undoped cairo pentagonal lattice shows antiferromagnetic ordering for @xmath8 , but undergoes a first - order transition to a ferrimagnetic phase for @xmath9 @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that @xmath11 tracks the transition in the form of a cusp maximum at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> while both phases show frustration , the obtained magnetic structures reveal that the frustration originates in different bonds for the two phases . </S>",
    "<S> the frustration and ferrimagnetic order get quenched by selective exchange coupling , and lead to robust antiferromagnetic ordering for @xmath2 = 1/6 and 1/3 . from mean - field calculations , we determine the temperature - dependent sub - lattice magnetizations for @xmath2 = @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated results are discussed in relation to known experimental results for trivalent bi@xmath14fe@xmath15o@xmath16 and mixed valent bife@xmath14o@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the study identifies the role of frustration effects , the ratio @xmath5 and selective exchange coupling for stabilizing ferrimagnetic versus anti - ferromagnetic order in the cairo pentagonal lattice . </S>"
