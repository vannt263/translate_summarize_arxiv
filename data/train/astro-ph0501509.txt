    "one of the major task in modern cosmology is the precise determination of the parameters which characterize the assumed cosmological model . in this _ direct approach _ ( according to ellis ( 1995 ) terminology ) a theoretical description of the space - time is postulated , the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model , and its parameters are determined by fitting the observational data .",
    "the corner stone of the observational support to the flrw model is the existence and the high isotropy of the relic cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmwb ) .",
    "ehlers , geren & sachs ( 1968 ) showed that if the background radiation appears to be _ exactly _ isotropic to a given family of observers then the space - time is _ exactly _ flrw .",
    "therefore , together with the copernican principle , we can prove the universe to be flrw just from our own observations of the cmwb .",
    "stoeger , maartens & ellis ( 1995 ) extended this result to the case of an almost isotropic background radiation , which implies an almost flrw space - time .",
    "this important results is a firmer ground for the assumption of the flrw model to describe the large scale structure of the universe , but it also makes clear that we need to understand the departures from a spatially homogeneous model when interpreting observational data .",
    "indeed , departures form perfect homogeneity change the distance - redshift relation , and this has to be taken into account when fitting the flrw parameters to observations . however , cosmological observations are usually fitted just using relationships derived for homogeneous models .    in recent years",
    ", several authors have addressed this problem in the context of the observations of distant type ia supernovae ( e.g. , holz 1998 , holz & wald 1998 , kantowski , kao & thomas 2000 , sereno et al .",
    "2002 , wang , holz & munshi 2002 , pyne & birkinshaw 2004 ) .",
    "it has been shown that the noise due to weak lensing magnification from small scale matter inhomogeneities yields large errors on the luminosity measurement of high-@xmath2 supernovae .    in this paper",
    "we aim at investigating the possible systematic errors due to neglecting the effects of the local inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter when evaluating the cosmological constant @xmath3 from gravitational lenses statistics .",
    "statistics of gravitationally lensed multiply imaged quasars has been since a long time considered an useful tool to constrain the cosmological parameters , in particular the cosmological constant @xcite , and the properties of the lensing galaxies ( e.g. maoz & rix 1993 , kochanek 1993 ) .",
    "recently , chae ( 2003 ) has shown that the observed gravitational lensing rate in the class radio survey yields strong support to a flat cosmological model dominated by vacuum energy , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the precision of these results is limited at the moment by the uncertainty on the knowledge of the luminosity function of the lensing galaxy population , their density profile and their evolution since @xmath6 ( e.g. , mao 1991 , chae 2003 ) .",
    "for instance , cheng & krauss ( 2000 ) have shown that constraints on cosmological parameter are strongly dependent on the choice of galaxies parameters ( see also discussion in kochanek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) .",
    "another major limit is the fact that only few systematic surveys for multiply imaged quasars have been completed up to date @xcite ; today in fact , the statistical uncertainties on @xmath7 are still dominated by the poisson errors from the small number of gravitationally lensed quasars . in the near future , the most promising source for new lensed quasars will be wide field surveys ( kuhlen , keeton & madau 2004 ) and targeted followups of newly discovered quasars ( morgan 2002 , morgan et al .",
    "for instance , the sloan digital sky survey will almost double the number of known gravitational lenses .",
    "next considerable increase in the number of gravitational lenses is expected by new telescopes like the vlt survey telescope , which will allow very wide and deep optical surveys in the southern hemisphere .",
    "see also kuhlen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for a discussion of other gravitational lenses surveys to become operational in the next future .",
    "while these large observational projects will considerably improve the precision of the results and the importance of the tool , they also make necessary to consider more realistically the detail of the light propagation through the observed not homogeneous universe .",
    "as pointed out by ellis ( 1995 ) , small scale inhomogeneities in matter distribution have a considerable effect on both observations ( dyer & oattes 1988 ) and dynamics ( russ et al .",
    "1997 ) at large scale . moreover , since the lensing effects of the small inhomogeneities on the propagation of light change the angular diameter distance - redshift relation ( schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) , we focus here on this specific problem .",
    "many different approaches have been developed to study the gravitational lensing in inhomogeneous cosmological models , but the simplest one from an analytical point of view , and yet efficient , is the one proposed by dyer & roeder ( 1972 , 1973 ) , in which the effect of the local inhomogeneities along the light bundles are described by the so - called clumpiness parameter @xmath1 ( see definition in next section ) . in the following ,",
    "we allow the clumpiness parameter to be a direction - dependent quantity , which is function both of the line of sight to the source and its redshift ( see , e.g. wang ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "the statistical properties of a sample of gravitational lenses include the frequency of multiply imaged quasars , the distribution of the lenses and source redshifts , of the angular separation distribution and of the image multiplicity . in this work",
    "we will focus on the discussion of the total lensing probability , leaving a detailed discussion of the other statistical properties for a following paper .",
    "moreover , as we focus our attention on an effect which is independent from our present day knowledge of the galaxy luminosity function and the dark matter velocity dispersion , we do not consider these aspects in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we define the cosmological model and discuss the relevant distances in the study of the propagation of light . in sect .",
    "3 we calculate the gravitational lenses rate , and in sect .  4",
    "we discuss its behavior as a function of @xmath1 , considering different gravitational lens models .",
    "finally , systematic effects on the estimate of the cosmological constant are discussed in sect .  5 , and in sect .",
    "6 we sum up our results .",
    "while cosmological models which are homogeneous at all scales are very successful in describing the overall dynamics and evolution of the universe , they do not allow a detailed description of the lensing phenomena .",
    "as a fact , all the gravitational lensing phenomena ( bending of light rays , deformation of images , and formation of multiple images ) are only possible in a clumpy universe , ( see , e.g. , the discussion by krasisky ) . therefore , a coherent approach needs an inhomogeneous model .",
    "however , in the statistical analysis of gravitational lenses , as well as in analysis of other astronomical observations , perfect homogeneity is often assumed ( see , e.g. , discussion in buchert ( 2000 ) about this point ) .",
    "an important reason for this choice is the fact that in homogeneous space - times we have simple relations between the proper distance and the cosmological distances , i.e. the luminosity distance and the angular diameter distance ( e.g. , kayser , helbig & schramm 1997 ) . in inhomogeneous cosmological models ,",
    "these relations are much more complicated , and friedmann - lematre ( fl ) distances are not generally a good approximation to be used in the determination of cosmological parameters from a given set of observational data .    the relevant distance in gravitational lensing , the angular diameter distance @xmath8 , is operationally defined by the square root of the ratio of the area @xmath9 of a celestial body to the solid angle @xmath10 it subtends at the observer :    @xmath11    in a homogeneous universe , the angular diameter distance can be derived from the proper distance @xmath12 using the following relation @xmath13 this relation does not hold anymore in a clumpy universe .",
    "the basic reason lies in the fact that the proper distance is related to the global geometry of the universe , while the relation between the angular diameter distance and the redshift is determined mainly by the local matter distribution .    in this paper",
    "we assume a cosmological model which is locally inhomogeneous , but homogeneous at very large scale , according to some density averaging rule ( see , e.g. , krasiski ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "in other words , we assume that the overall dynamics does not differ from the dynamics of a homogeneous cosmological model . this approximation is well justified : by averaging the friedmann equation , russ et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that the influence of small scale clumpiness on the global expansion factor is negligible ( so , for instance , the age of the universe can be evaluated using the flrw relation with the hubble constant , with negligible errors ) , while the distance - redshift relation is significantly affected ( so that the measurements of the hubble constant via measurements of standard candles magnitudes have not negligible systematic errors ) .    in order to describe the degree of inhomogeneity in the local distribution of matter",
    ", we use a generalized notion of the so - called clumpiness parameter ( e.g. , dyer & roeder 1972 , schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) , introduced by wang ( 1999 ) .",
    "the clumpiness parameter @xmath1 was first introduced by dyer & roeder ( 1972 , 1973 , hereafter dr ) , when writing a differential equation for the angular diameter distance in locally clumpy cosmological models , and it was defined as the fraction of homogeneously dstributed matter within a given light cone .",
    "starting from the equations for scalar optics ( e.g. , zeldovich , kristian & sachs ) , dr derived a second order differential equation for the diameter of the light ray bundle propagating far away from any clumps ( i.e. in regions where @xmath14 ) , assuming a negligible shear . for a pressure - less universe with cosmological constant @xmath3",
    ", the dr equation reads : @xmath15 with initial conditions @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 , since we neglect the contribution from any relativistic fluid or radiation .",
    "for @xmath19 ( filled beam case ) we recover the angular diameter distance , while for @xmath20 we have the well - known empty beam approximation . for a detailed discussion of the solutions of the equation ( [ eqn : dr ] ) within quintessence cosmological models",
    "we refer to sereno et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . for the following , it is useful to introduce the dimensionless distance @xmath21 : @xmath22 and the symbol @xmath23 for the dimensionless angular diameter distance in the filled beam case .    note ,",
    "however that the dr equation ( [ eqn : dr ] ) is well defined for any @xmath24 , and in its derivation the mass density is never required to be uniform .",
    "this allows to consider the clumpiness parameert as a local variable , as done in wang ( 1999 ) to descibe the weak lensing magnification of distant standard candles .",
    "therefore , in the following we assume the clumpiness parameter to be a function both of the line of sight and the redshift .",
    "given a source at resdhift @xmath2 in a specific inhomogeneous cosmological model , for any line of sight to the observer the clumpiness parameter @xmath1 is calculated via equation ( [ eqn : dr ] ) , where the distance @xmath8 is given by numerical simulations . as a consequence , a complete description of the light propagation in the clumpy universe needs the knowledge of the probablity distribution function ( pdf ) for values of the clumpiness parameter .",
    "we return to this point in sect .  5",
    "let us now consider in more detail the effect of inhomogeneities in observations meant to measure the cosmological constant .",
    "the dr distance @xmath21 is a strongly decreasing function of @xmath1 , at fixed redshift ( schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) : therefore , a larger fraction of matter in clumps partially masks the effect of a larger cosmological constant when evaluating angular diameter and luminosity distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : drdistance ] ) , since there a smaller contribution from the ricci convergence . on the other side , along light beams characterized by @xmath25 ( i.e. , propagating in overdense regions ) agular diameters distances are lower than in the filled beam case .",
    "for this reason a large amount of local clumpiness can result in a lower value for @xmath3 when fitting the observational data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : figura2 ] we show the ratio of the dr distance for the empty beam case relatively to the filled beam for a few value of the source redshifts . up to redshift @xmath26 ,",
    "the differences are not important in the dr distance itself ( although , they maybe not negligible for several astronomical observable quantities ) .",
    "the role of the local clumps becomes more and more important at higher @xmath2 .",
    "though the assumed cosmological model is not the most satisfactory to describe inhomogeneities , since it has not a firm theoretical basis in the framework of general relativity ( i.e. , it is not a solution of the einstein field equations ) , it allows a simple and efficient description of the light propagation through a clumpy universe .",
    "this model has been discussed in detail in schneider et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and seitz , schneider & ehlers .",
    "ehlers & schneider have introduced a self - consistent formalism to study the gravitational lensing in a clumpy universe . in particular",
    ", they stressed the different roles that the different notions of cosmological distances have in this model .",
    "namely , when we consider quantities which are related to the global geometry of the assumed cosmological model ( such as volumes ) , it is necessary to use the fl angular diameter distance .",
    "then , the volume element ( i.e. the volume of a shell with proper thickness @xmath27 ) is @xmath28 in other words , the volume element @xmath29 does not depend on the local inhomogeneity degree .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the locally inhomogeneous model , on large angular scales ( i.e. , larger than @xmath30 , see linder ( 1988 ) ) , the distance - redshift relation is the one computed in the flrw models , for any source redshift .",
    "this is also in agreement with the results from n - body numerical simulations in cold dark matter scenarios ( tomita 1998 ) , where it has been shown that the dispersion in values of @xmath1 along the different light paths becomes increasingly larger as the angular is as small as a few arcsec .",
    "we also note that equation ( [ eq : volume ] ) can be read as the definition of the angular diameter distance in homogeneous models ( schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) .    on the other side ,",
    "there a simple reason why , when considering gravitational lensing phenomena , the dr distance has to be used : light deflection modifies the cross area of the light bundle and the ricci focusing term is a linear function of the amount of matter within the ray bundle ( see , e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "1992 , sect .",
    "3.4 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "all the distance dependent quantities which play a role in the description of the lensing phenomena are functions of the dr distance , and , in particular , the strong lensing cross section @xmath31 .",
    "let us consider in more detail the cosmological strong lensing probability @xmath0 .",
    "this is defined as the probability that a light source at redshift @xmath32 is multiply imaged by a deflector at @xmath33 . in the expression of @xmath34",
    "there are two different physical quantities which are functions of combinations of distances : the cross section for multiple images @xmath31 , and the volume element @xmath29 .",
    "the cross section @xmath31 is defined as the area in the lens plane for which multiple imaging occurs for sources behind it .",
    "this quantity depends on the redshift @xmath2 of the lens and a set @xmath35 of astrophysical parameters which characterize the gravitational lens model . for the most generally used models ( point - like mass distributions and isothermal spheres ) the cross section depends on a particular combination of distances :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the dr angular diameter distances between the observer and the source , the observer and the lens and between the lens and the source , respectively .",
    "we remark that the overall effect of the clumpy distribution of matter along the light rays on the lensing probability is not due to any change of the volume element @xmath29 , see equation ( [ eq : volume ] ) , but it is only because of the dependence of the strong lensing cross section @xmath31 on the clumpiness parameter .    in the following",
    "we will consider the projection of the cross section on the source plane ( located at redshift @xmath32 ) : @xmath39 ^ 2 \\sigma ( z , z_s , \\chi ) , \\label{sigma - projected}\\ ] ] where the dr distances are considered .",
    "this quantity allows a more clear and compact definition of the lensing probability and it is the natural quantity to consider in the assumed cosmological model @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the quantity @xmath40 is not in general a function of the the distance combination @xmath41 : as a consequence , the point - like mass and isothermal sphere cross sections are functions of different distances combinations ( see sect .",
    "we now calculate the probability of strong lensing phenomena and evaluate its dependence on @xmath1 , and then determine explicitly the distance functions for these two gravitational lens models .",
    "in this section , we derive the formulae for the statistics of gravitational lensing , following mainly the formalism discussed in ehlers & schneider , considering in particular the proper role of the two types of distances .",
    "let us consider a statistical ensemble of cosmological sources at redshift @xmath32 and a set of comoving gravitational lenses with number density @xmath42 .",
    "if we neglect gravitational lenses evolution and mergings , the comoving number density of lenses is conserved : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the local density .",
    "the number of gravitational lenses in a shell with volume @xmath29 is then @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the area of the sphere located at redshift @xmath2 .",
    "the probability @xmath47 that a quasar at @xmath32 is multiply imaged by a gravitational lens in the redshift range @xmath48 is defined as the fraction of the area of the sphere at @xmath49 ( i.e. , the fraction of the sky ) covered by the gravitational lenses cross sections @xmath50 .",
    "this definition implicitly assumes that the projected cross sections do not overlap , which is equivalent to state that @xmath51 .",
    "the area covered by the projected cross sections of the gravitational lenses in @xmath48 is therefore    @xmath52    according to the definition , the differential lensing probability then reads @xmath53 ^ 2 \\left [ \\frac{r_1(z)}{r_1(z_s ) } \\right]^2 \\frac{dl}{dz } dz.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the particular case @xmath54 , the distance ratios factorize , so that we obtain the more common expression @xmath55 i.e. , the definition of differential lensing probability in cosmologies which are homogeneous at all scales .",
    "therefore , in this case , the relevant distance combination is exactly the ratio @xmath41 which appears in equation ( [ sigma - def ] ) , and does not depend on the particular choice of the gravitational lens model .",
    "let us now evaluate the explicit expressions for the lensing probabilities in equation ( [ d - tau-1 ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 can be written in the following way : @xmath56 where we considered the past light cone , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 being the normalized cosmological scale factor . in a flrw cosmological model @xmath59    hereafter we focus our attention to flat cosmological models , i.e. , with @xmath60 , as these are preferred by inflationary scenarios and strongly supported by many recent observational evidences @xcite .",
    "then , the differential lensing probability reads @xmath61 ^ 2 \\left [ \\frac{r_1(z)}{r_1(z_s ) } \\right]^2 \\times   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{(1+z)^2}{\\sqrt{\\omega_{\\rm m } ( 1+z)^3 + \\omega_{\\lambda } } } \\ , dz \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is evident that the properties of the functions @xmath62 ( and @xmath0 ) with respect to @xmath1 are determined only by the strong lensing cross section @xmath63 .",
    "thereby , it is necessary to consider only those functions of the dr distances which enter their expressions . in other words , the functions @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath40 have the same qualitative behaviors with respect to the clumpiness parameter .",
    "then , our next point is to investigate the behavior of the quantity @xmath65 .",
    "in this section we analyze in detail the cross sections of some general models of gravitational lenses and the involved combinations of dr distances , in order to evaluate qualitatively the dependence of the lensing probability @xmath0 on the clumpiness parameter .",
    "asada has investigated the analytical properties of several combinations of dr distances as functions of the clumpiness parameter , and he also deduced some consequences on the observable quantities : the deflection angle , the time delay , and the lensing probability . here",
    "we focus on the study of the quantities which directly enter the optical depth .",
    "we consider the following models : a point mass distribution , singular isothermal sphere , and isothermal sphere with a non zero core radius . in this section",
    "we only consider the dr distances .",
    "a point - like gravitational lens produces two images , whatever the source position is ; so , strictly speaking , the given definition of strong lensing cross section does not apply here . anyway",
    ", it is natural to assume such a cross section ( _ on the lens plane _ ) to be the disk with radius equal to einstein radius @xmath66 .",
    "so , the cross section _ on the source plane _ reads : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass of the lens .",
    "this quantity is a decreasing function of the clumpiness parameter @xmath1 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lentepunto ] .",
    "consequently , at smaller value of the clumpiness parameter , the lensing probability is higher , when considering the lensing cross section for a point - like distribution of mass .",
    "consider that the distances ratio @xmath69 in the expression of the einstein radius @xmath66 is a decreasing function of the clumpiness parameter @xcite , but it is not the right function of dr distances which enters the expression of the lensing probability in a dr cosmological model , as shown above . as a fact , considering this ratio is not coherent with the assumptions on the cosmological model @xcite , and would wrongly lead to predict that the lensing probability decreases for decreasing values of the clumpiness parameter , as in asada .",
    "let us consider now the gravitational lenses to be isothermal spheres , and let us study the dependence of the cross section on @xmath1 .",
    "many authors have shown that singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) allow a detailed description of the matter distribution in individual gravitational lenses ( see , e.g. , rusin et al .",
    "2002 ) , and are therefore used in statistical analysis of the lensing galaxies population ( e.g. , chae 2003 ) .",
    "sis are characterized by the surface mass density    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the position vector on the lens plane , and @xmath72 the line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "see , e.g. , hinshaw & krauss and schneider et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for a detailed description of its lensing properties .",
    "the area in the lens plane for multiple lensing is @xmath73 ^ 2 \\ , .\\ ] ] note that the distance combination which enters equation ( [ sis - sigma ] ) is the same as in the einstein radius for a point - like gravitational lens .",
    "but , when we consider the projection on the source plane , we get @xmath74 as the angular diameter distance between two points at redshifts @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a decreasing function of @xmath1 @xcite , so is the cross section @xmath77 and , consequently , the optical depth @xmath0 . in fig .  [ fig - is]a we plot the cross section @xmath78 relatively to the filled beam case , evaluated along different line of sghts characterized by different values of the clumpiness parameter .",
    "let us now consider an isothermal sphere with a non zero core radius @xmath79 .",
    "the surface mass density is @xmath80 , which leads to a non constant deflection angle .",
    "the cross section on the lens plane is @xcite @xmath81     & \\beta < \\frac{1}{2}\\\\ 0 & \\beta > \\frac{1}{2 } \\end{array } \\right .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the core radius @xmath79 in units of the natural length scale @xmath83 the projected cross section for multiple imaging is , for @xmath84 , @xmath85 where we introduced the quantity @xmath86 .",
    "the presence of a core radius lowers the lensing probability , but does not change its qualitative properties with respect to the clumpiness parameter , see fig .  [ fig - is]b . note that the function @xmath87 is not a constant , since @xmath82 is not , with respect to the clumpiness parameter .",
    "the dimensionless core radius @xmath82 is a function of the redshifts @xmath88 , and the cosmological parameters and the clumpiness parameter , via the length unit @xmath89 : @xmath90    it is interesting to note that , despite the fact that the cross sections of the considered gravitational lens models differ in the dr distances ratio , they are both decreasing functions of @xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "the monotonic properties of the cosmological optical depth with respect to @xmath1 are general .",
    "finally , it is evident that neglecting @xmath1 leads , in the theoretical predictions , to underestimate the probability of strong lensing , and , in the statistical analysis of high redshift quasars catalogs , to overestimate the cosmological constant .",
    "this is discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we evaluate numerically the optical depth in a flat cosmology as a function of the cosmological parameter @xmath7 and of the clumpiness parameter @xmath1 .",
    "in particular we analyze quantitatively the effect due to neglecting the local inhomogeneity in calculating the lensing probability in a clumpy universe , along lines of sight with @xmath14 . for this purpose , we consider the gravitational lenses to be singular isothermal spheres , because they allow a very simple and analytical treatment of the problem , and have been used in a variety of studies of the statistical properties of the gravitational lenses ( see chae ( 2003 ) and references therein ) , allowing a direct comparison of the results .",
    "moreover , this particular choice does not affect out qualitative results .",
    "as we are mainly interested in the effects due to a variation of @xmath1 , we compare the optical depth @xmath91 with @xmath92 , the numerical value in the case with vanishing cosmological constant and light propagation through filled beams , so that our discussion is independent of the numerical parameter @xmath93 which controls the lensing probability . in fig .",
    "[ tau - confronto ] we plot the relative optical depth @xmath94 as a function of the source redshift , for six different cosmological models , in which @xmath95 , considering lines of sight with @xmath96 for each case .",
    "as it is well known , the strong lensing probability is very sensitive to the value of the vacuum energy ( e.g. , fukugita et al .",
    "1992 ) . for any value of @xmath1 , the probability that a source at given redshift @xmath32 is multiply imaged grows by a factor of @xmath97 , if @xmath7 goes from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "in order to disentangle the effect of the clumpy distribution of matter from that due to the cosmological constant , we consider @xmath100 , i.e. the relative variation of the lensing probability with respect to the case @xmath19 , as a function of @xmath7 along lines of sight characterized by @xmath14 .",
    "we plot this quantity , evaluated at different source redshifts , in fig .",
    "[ fig - relative - tau ] .",
    "as shown above , for any @xmath32 and @xmath7 , the lensing probability is a decreasing function of the clumpiness parameter .",
    "we also notice that the effect of the clumpiness parameter increases with the redshift of the sources , if a given direction with @xmath14 is considered .",
    "the most important feature to note is that the variation becomes rapidly less important at larger values of the cosmological constant .",
    "the reason for this effect is twofold .",
    "first , for larger values of the cosmological constant , the influence of all other astrophysical and cosmological parameters is expected to be less important , since at high @xmath7 , the optical depth is very sensible to any small change in the value of the cosmological constant .",
    "second , @xmath1 enters the equation ( [ eqn : dr ] ) as a coefficient of the matter density parameter , determined ( in the flat cosmological models ) by the relation @xmath101 ; so it is relatively less important for small values of the density parameter . in the most commonly accepted range for the cosmological constant ( @xmath102 ) , the lensing probability increases ( relatively to a completely homogeneous matter distribution ) by a factor of about @xmath103 if we consider the clumpiness parameter @xmath104 respectively .    as stated above , in order to have a coherent description of the small scale clumpiness we need to consider the pdf for @xmath1 , since this a direction - dependent quantity .",
    "the pdf depends on the background flrw cosmological model , and can be derived from the pdf of the lensing magnification @xmath105 , calculated in numerical simulations ( e.g. , wambsganss et al .",
    "1997 , holz & wald 1998 , tomita 1998 , mrtsell 2002 ) , via the relation @xmath106 ^ 2 \\ , , \\label{eqn : mu}\\ ] ] and the dr equation . as shown by wang ( 1999 ) , in general the @xmath1 pdf is peaked at @xmath14 for any @xmath2 , but it tends to be more symmetric and shows smaller scatter around the peak value as the redshift increases ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 in wang 1999 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] we plot , for a flat spacetime with @xmath107 , both the most likely value and the average values , as calculated via the approximate analytic expressions of the pdf ( @xmath1 ) given in wang ( 1999 ) .",
    "the mean value of @xmath108 is 1 at any redshift in all cosmological models ( if they are flrw on average as assumed here ) .",
    "this is indeed the same proprierty which is known to hold for the pdf of the lensing magnification @xmath109 , whose basic motivation is the flux conservation ( weinberg 1976 ) .",
    "therefore we expect that the effect of inhomogeneoties on the lensing cross sections is reduced in large ensemble of gravitational lenses , or very distant sources .    for a gravitational lens at @xmath110 ,",
    "the most likely value is @xmath111 ; this translates in an underestimates of the lensing cross section for a sis ( using the fille beam distances and considering a source at @xmath112 ) of a factor @xmath113 , see fig .",

    "these systematic errors decrease for more distant gravitational lenses or sources , but since the most likely value is always lower than 1 , and in a relatively small sample of gravitational lenses the mean of a nonsymmetric probability distribution is not likely the best estimator , such errors may become not neglibible when evaluating the cosmological parameters .    while a detailed statistical analysis including an accurate determination for the pdf for any cosmological model is beyond the scope of the present work , it is anyway important to estimate now an upper limit to the possible errors on the predicted number of gravitational lenses .",
    "we have therefore considered the list of 1163 luminous quasars . which have been observed in the following optical surveys : cfht ( crampton , mcclure & fletcher 1992 ) , cfht ( yee , filippenko & tang 1993 ) , hst ( maoz et al . 1993 ) , not ( jaunsen et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this catalog contains 7 confirmed gravitational lenses , and its redshift distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - histogram ] : the peak is at redshift @xmath114 , and only a small fraction of sources are beyond @xmath115 .",
    "we have calculated the relative variation in the expected number of multiply imaged quasars considering different values for the clumpiness parameter , corresponding to peak values of its pdf for @xmath116 and 3.0 .",
    "the lensing galaxies are being modelled as sis ( note that including a small core makes the clumpiness effect slighlty larger ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig - expectedn ] , we plot the relative variation of the expected number of lenses as a function of @xmath7 for the peak values @xmath117 .",
    "this figure shows the upper limit for the systematic errors that can be found for the predicted numner fo gravitational lenses when adopting the simple filled beam hypothesis ; given the property @xmath118 , this could be further reduced in upcoming larger surveys .",
    "note that , since we are considering a flat spacetime and the effect of the local inhomogeneities increases with @xmath119 , the variation of the expected number @xmath120 of multiply imaged quasars is a decreasing function of the cosmological constant .",
    "however , only for a very large value of the cosmological constant ( @xmath121 ) , such a variation becomes rapidly small .",
    "this makes clear the point that if in the evaluation of @xmath0 we use angular diameter distances for a perfectly homogeneous cosmological model , we can underestimate the lensing probability and , consequently , overestimate @xmath7 .",
    "in this work we have investigated whether the local departures from a completly homogeneous cosmological model can have observable effects in the statistical study of high-@xmath2 gravitational lenses . following the work by ehlers & schneider , we derived the expressions for the cosmological optical depth in the framework of a cosmological model which is flrw on very large scales ( i.e. , whose overall dynamics is very well described by flrw models ) and whose matter distribution is locally inhomogeneous .",
    "the direction - dependent clumpiness parameter @xmath1 quantifies the fraction of matter in compact objects along a given line of sight , and its peak and mean values ( as a function fo the source redshift ) are calculated via the analytical approximation of the pdf given in wang ( 1999 ) .",
    "we have paid particular attention to disentangle the different role played by the different notions of distance in the definition of the optical depth @xmath122 : the small scale inhomogeneities along the line of sight do not change the volume element @xmath29 , but the strong lensing cross section , see equation ( [ eq : volume ] ) and fig .  [ fig - is ] . up to redshift @xmath123 , the most probable value of the clumpiness parameter is very different from the average value ( which is constrained to be @xmath124 in a model homogeneous on a large scale ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] , and the effect may be important in statistical analysis of relatively small sets of gravitationally lensed sources . asada ( 1998 ) presented a similar calculation to the one done here in sect .",
    "he discussed the influence of the clumpiness parameter on several gravitational lensing observable quantities , showing that in a clumpy universe deflection angles are smaller and time delays are longer than in an homogeneous universe , given the same lens - source configuration .",
    "however , in contraddiction with asada s result , we have found that the gravitational lenses rate is a decreasing function of the clumpiness parameter .",
    "we have shown that in the empty and filled beam cases different angular distances ratios enter the optical depth expression ( sect .",
    "3 ) , and this leads to an higher number of expected of gravitational lenses when light beams with @xmath125 are considered .",
    "while a detailed statistical analysis including the effect of small scale inhomogeneities on the determination of the cosmological constant is beyond the scope of the present work , we can already draw some important conclusions and compare our findings with previous works .",
    "since the @xmath1 mean value tends to be 1 when a sufficiently large number of different lines of sight is considered , the effect described here tends to be less important in large surveys for gravitationally lensed sources .",
    "moreover , since the peak value also tends to 1 for @xmath126 , statisical study of very high - redshift sources is less affected by the local clumpiness along the different lines of sight . on small set of lensed sources ,",
    "since the peak value of the clumpiness parameter is always lower than 1 , using the filled beam angular diameter distances leads to an overestimate of the number of the expect gravitational lenses ( fig .",
    "9 ) , and , consequently , to overestimate the cosmological cosntant .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same qualitative result ( on the determination of the cosmological constant ) has been found in previous works in which the authors have taken into accounts the effect on the distance - redshift relation playd by the matter distribution inhomogeneities . kantowski ( 1998 )",
    "described the effects of inhomogeneities on the determination of the cosmological constant and @xmath127 using a `` swiss cheese '' model to derive analytic expressions for the distance - redshift relation .",
    "he has shown that , when analyzing high-@xmath2 standard candles , assuming a completely homogeneous matter distribution leads to overestimating the cosmological constant if the filled beam hypotheisis is always used ( see , e.g. , fig .  8 in kantowski ( 1998 ) ) .    in a recent work , barris et al .",
    "( 2004 ) analyze a set of 194 type ia sne at @xmath128 ( including the 23 discovered in the ifa deep survey in the range @xmath129 ) using both the filled beam and the empty beam assumption for _ all _ the lines of sight to calculate luminosity distances has to be chosen to describe the clumpiness effects using the dr distances . ] .",
    "although the presence of small scale inhomogeneities is far from eliminating the need of a vacuum energy contribution to explain the new data , they do change the final estimate of the cosmological parameters @xmath119 and @xmath130 : indeed , when using the angular - diameter distances with @xmath20 , the confidence contours for the comsological parameters are shifted to lower values of @xmath130 and higher values of @xmath119    the same effect has been found by authors which investigated the effect of large scale inhomogeneity in the matter distribution .",
    "tomita ( 2001 ) considered a local void on scales of 200 - 300 mpc around our galaxy to interpret the high-@xmath2 sn data , effectively describing it with with @xmath14 in the dr distances .",
    "he finds that the data ( available at the time ) coule be well fitted with @xmath131 ( value estimated in the overdense outer region ) .",
    "it is certainly interesting to test these findings with the more recent and larger set of data available at the moment . in conclusion , a precise determination of the cosmological parameters using both the hubble diagram of the high-@xmath2 type ia sn and the statistical properties of gravitational lenses requires an accurate determination of the effect of the local clumpiness in the matter distribution on the light propagation .",
