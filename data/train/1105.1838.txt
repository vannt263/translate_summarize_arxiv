    "the concept of inverse orthogonalization of a sequence of functions emerged from the study of spectral methods for numerical simulation of near - wall turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "turbulence in the boundary layer near a flat plate is an intensive physical phenomenon that exhibits an exponential decay of disturbances far from the wall .",
    "thus , the sequence of exponential functions @xmath3 , being orthogonalized , can be employed for numerical simulation of the phenomenon .",
    "it was noticed that applying the alternative algorithm of inverse orthogonalization to the sequence of exponential functions is as constructive as applying the direct orthogonalization algorithm to the sequence of monomials @xmath4 $ ] , and the bidirectional algorithm of orthogonalization was introduced in @xcite for defining systems of orthogonal exponential polynomials on the semi - axis .",
    "later , the alternative legendre polynomials were presented , and two associated quadrature rules were obtained @xcite .    the alternative jacobi polynomials are described in this paper . by taking advantage of the bidirectional orthogonalization we establish general properties of the polynomials .",
    "we show that the shifted jacobi polynomials corresponding to the weight function with a translated parameter are a special subset of the alternative jacobi polynomials .",
    "also , we consider an exceptional case of singular orthogonality ; this feature takes place in some of the alternative systems .",
    "we find that the alternative jacobi polynomials in an exponential form are the system of functions on the semi - axis @xmath5 that has the same algorithmic capacity as the jacobi polynomials have on the interval @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "such a deduction is illustrated with two special subsystems of the exponential polynomials possessing nice properties .",
    "the orthogonal exponential polynomials on the semi - axis may serve a useful purpose in approximation of a continuous function on a closed interval .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce two parameterized systems of discretely almost orthogonal functions on the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "the systems are constituted of the orthogonal exponential polynomials and unity . for the second system , supplementary computations are required to meet the definition of the functions , and properties of such a special construction have not been studied .    to obtain these results we followed the classical theory of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "different aspects of the theory that we were inspired by are represented in monographs @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 be a fixed whole number and @xmath9 is the system of polynomials defined by rodrigues type formula as @xmath10 with @xmath11 . from ( [ j1 ] )",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath12 notation @xmath13 represents the falling factorial .",
    "the last formula contains the term of lowest order in @xmath14 such that @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gamma function .    for @xmath17 @xmath18    substituting ( [ j1 ] ) to ( [ j1aaa ] ) and integrating by parts we confirm ( [ j1aaa ] ) .",
    "the alternative jacobi polynomials @xmath19 satisfy @xmath20 @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the kronecker delta .",
    "since orthogonality is verified by lemma 1.1 , we only need to consider the case @xmath23 . substituting ( [ j1 ] ) and ( [ j1aa ] ) to ( [ j0 ] ) and integrating by parts we calculate @xmath24 . substituting @xmath25 and @xmath26 to @xmath24 we confirm the restrictions on @xmath27 and @xmath28 in ( [ jd ] ) .    for @xmath29 orthogonality relations ( [ j1aaa ] )  -   ( [ j2 ] )",
    "hold the invariance @xmath30 and @xmath31    polynomials @xmath32 are orthogonal on the interval @xmath0 $ ] with the weight function @xmath33 .    following the proof of theorem 2.2",
    "we also evaluate @xmath34    making use of ( [ j1 ] ) , cauchy s integral formula for analytic functions , and reciprocal substitutions one can obtain the integral representation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a closed contour encircling the point @xmath37 .",
    "being constructed by the procedure of inverse orthogonalization , polynomials @xmath19 can be represented in terms of the jacobi polynomials .",
    "below we derive two relationships of such kind .",
    "first we determine the relationship between @xmath38 and polynomials from the sequence @xmath39 that are defined by the procedure of direct orthogonalization as @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 since @xmath8 is fixed , by verifying ( [ jsign ] ) , ( [ j2b ] ) , and ( [ j2a ] ) , the polynomials @xmath43 can be immediately connected to a fixed set of the jacobi polynomials @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "precisely , @xmath45 this formula can be used directly for describing properties of @xmath46 , and one of the results that follow from ( [ j3 ] ) is the integral representation @xmath47 here @xmath48 is a closed contour encircling the point @xmath49 .",
    "comparison of ( [ j21 ] ) and ( [ j5 ] ) leads to @xmath50    thus , relation of reciprocity ( [ j6 ] ) associates two sequences of polynomials that contain different powers @xmath51  i.e. , with @xmath52 and with @xmath53 respectively .",
    "let us now consider the relationship between @xmath38 and polynomials from the sequence @xmath54 such that @xmath55 shifted jacobi polynomials ( [ jj1 ] ) are orthogonal on the interval @xmath0 $ ] with the weight function @xmath56 .",
    "the polynomials can also be defined by the rodrigues formula as @xmath57 comparing ( [ j1 ] ) and ( [ jj2 ] ) we find that @xmath58      relation of reciprocity ( [ j6 ] ) and formula ( [ j3 ] ) , as well as ( [ jj3 ] ) and ( [ jj1 ] ) , enable employing the classical results for establishing properties of @xmath19 .    following ( [ j6 ] ) and ( [ j3 ] ) we obtain the three - term recurrence relation @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62\\ ] ] @xmath63 and the differential - difference relations @xmath64\\ ] ] @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67x{\\cal p}_{nk}^{(\\alpha,\\beta)}(x)\\ ] ] @xmath68 following ( [ jj3 ] ) and ( [ jj1 ] ) we find the differentiation formula @xmath69 for @xmath70 , and the differential equation @xmath71y^{\\prime}(x)\\ ] ] @xmath72y(x)=0 \\label{de1}\\ ] ] that has a solution @xmath73 .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath25 .",
    "it follows from ( [ jj3 ] ) that @xmath74 thus , the shifted jacobi polynomials with translated @xmath27 , @xmath75 , are a subset of the alternative jacobi polynomials @xmath19 .",
    "relation ( [ al2 ] ) can also be directly traced from equation ( [ de1 ] ) . for @xmath25",
    "the degrees of the polynomial coefficients in ( [ de1 ] ) are reduced by one , and this makes @xmath76 the sequence with classical properties .    for @xmath77 polynomials @xmath19",
    "are less perfect . by considering property ( [ dx ] ) , or by differentiating ( [ de1 ] )",
    ", we find that the first derivative of a @xmath19 is not a constant multiple of a @xmath78 with an @xmath79 , and so @xmath80 do not belong to the original class of polynomials .",
    "still , other properties of @xmath19 described above are similar to properties of the classical orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the restriction @xmath81 for the the weight function @xmath82 in ( [ j1aaa ] ) , ( [ j0 ] ) is stronger than the restriction on @xmath27 in ( [ al2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath83 . in this exceptional case",
    "the polynomial @xmath84 is not integrable with respect to the weight function @xmath85 and therefore non - normalizable .",
    "however , it is consistent with orthogonality relations ( [ j1aaa ] ) , ( [ j0 ] ) for @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath84 is a singular term of the sequence @xmath87 , which we call a marginal system .",
    "assuming @xmath77 one can employ the sequences @xmath88 for approximation of a continuous function @xmath89 on the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "such an approximation is effective near @xmath90 only if @xmath91 .",
    "below we describe two noteworthy orthogonal sequences that hold singular terms .      considering ( [ j1 ] ) we find that @xmath92 are the shifted legendre polynomials .",
    "this classical set of polynomials is a singular subset of the system @xmath93 the system @xmath94 was introduced in @xcite , and it is the first example of an inversely orthogonalized sequence of monomials @xmath95 .",

    "the classical orthogonal polynomials have a property of discrete orthogonality and the alternative orthogonal polynomials have it also ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the sequence @xmath123 since 1 is not the term of the sequence , direct orthogonalization of ( [ e00 ] ) on the semi - axis with a chosen weight function does not result in gauss type quadrature and , consequently , in the discrete orthogonality of the sequence .",
    "thus , inverse orthogonalization is the only procedure for constructing the exponential polynomials possessing such a property ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the set of orthogonal functions introduced below a unique system .",
    "let @xmath124 be the polynomials of exponential function defined as @xmath125 from ( [ e0 ] ) it immediately follows that @xmath126 is the orthogonal system , such that @xmath127 @xmath128 for @xmath81 , @xmath129 .",
    "properties of @xmath130 that are of interest for computations can be easily derived from the results of previous sections .",
    "in particular , ( [ e1 ] ) leads to the three - term recurrence relationship , which sets the associated orthogonal function @xmath131 .",
    "since @xmath131 is not integrable on the semi - axis with the weight function 1 , we do not include it in @xmath126 .",
    "functions @xmath132 form the system with nice properties , because the zeros of @xmath131 are the abscissas of gauss type quadratures for the exponential functions on the semi - axis .    in the next subsection we present two systems that are the exponential form of polynomials @xmath96 and @xmath133 .",

    "one may try to apply the system @xmath155 as the basis functions . here , the scale parameter @xmath156 is the maximum non - trivial zero of the zeros @xmath157 of the function @xmath158 @xcite .",
