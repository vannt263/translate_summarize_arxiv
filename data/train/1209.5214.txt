    "the standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak interactions is the present paradigm of particle physics .",
    "its validity has been tested to a level better than one per mile at particle accelerators  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are arguments against the sm being the fundamental model of particle interactions  @xcite , giving rise to the investigation of competing alternative or extended models , which can be tested at high - energy colliders , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc )  , or a @xmath0 , @xmath1 international linear collider ( ilc )  .",
    "one of the most promising possibilities for physics beyond the standard model is supersymmetry ( susy )  , which leads to a renormalizable field theory with precisely calculable predictions to be tested in present and future experiments .",
    "the simplest model of this kind is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . among the most important phenomenological consequences of susy models ,",
    "is the prediction of new particles , the susy partners of sm particles , sometimes called sparticles .",
    "there is much excitement for the possibility of discovering these new particles at lhc  @xcite .",
    "the lhc collaborations are already performing searches on these particles , and excluding portions of the susy parameter space , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "recently , the cms and atlas collaborations have reported a 5 standard deviations signal on a new boson particle , at a mass @xmath2 , which is compatible with the interpretation of a sm higgs boson@xcite .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron also found ( less significant ) signals compatible with this interpretation  @xcite .",
    "this signal is also compatible with the lightest neutral higgs boson of the mssm  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "precision measurements and precision computations are both mandatory nowadays . under the huge avalanche of new data at present , an accurate prediction of sparticles couplings to other particles and their production cross - section is needed . in this work",
    "we focus on the properties of the squarks  the susy partners of sm quarks .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on the squark decay channels involving charginos and neutralinos  the fermionic susy partners of the electroweak gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "once produced , squarks will decay in a way dependent on the model parameters ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if gluinos ( the fermionic susy partners of the sm gluons ) are light enough , squarks will mainly decay into gluinos and quarks ( @xmath3 )  @xcite , which proceeds through a coupling constant of strong strength .",
    "if the mass difference among different squarks is large enough , some squarks can decay via a bosonic channel into an electroweak gauge boson and another squark ( @xmath4 ) , and if higgs bosons are light enough , also the scalar decay channels are available ( @xmath5 )  @xcite , which can be dominant for third generation squarks due to the large yukawa couplings . otherwise , the main decay channels of squarks are the fermionic ones : chargino / neutralino and a quark ( @xmath6)@xcite . some of those channels are expected to be always open , given the large mass difference between quarks and squarks , and that the charginos / neutralinos are expected to be lighter than most of squarks in the majority of susy - breaking models . in the few cases in which these channels are closed , the squarks will decay through flavour changing neutral channels  @xcite , or through three- or four - body decay channels involving a non - resonant susy particle  @xcite .    here",
    "we will concentrate on the squark decay channels involving charginos and neutralinos .",
    "their partial decay widths were computed some time ago , including the radiative corrections due to the strong ( qcd )  @xcite , and the electroweak ( ew)@xcite sectors of the theory .",
    "these radiative corrections are large in certain regions of the parameter space@xcite , and their complicated expressions are not suitable for their introduction in the monte - carlo programs used in experimental analysis .",
    "recently ref .",
    "@xcite presented an improved description of squark / chargino / neutralino couplings , more simple to write and to introduce in computer codes .",
    "this computation combines the effective description ( which includes higher order terms ) with the complete one - loop description ( which includes all kinetic and mass - effects factors ) and defines a new effective coupling .",
    "it includes a non - decoupling logarithmic gluino mass term , which implies a deviation of the higgsino / gaugino and higgs / gauge couplings equality predicted by exact susy .",
    "this deviation is important and has to be taken into account in the experimental measurement of susy relations .",
    "ref.@xcite showed that the effective description approximates the improved description within a @xmath7 precision , except in special uninteresting corners of the parameter space , where the corresponding branching ratios are practically zero .",
    "ref.@xcite applies the description only to squark decays .",
    "the present work expands the results of ref.@xcite by applying those results to the production cross - section of squarks at the lhc . to that end",
    "we have implemented this effective description in madgraph s",
    "@xcite mssm framework  @xcite , we have applied it to the partial decay widths of squarks into charginos and neutralinos and we have computed the corresponding cross - section .",
    "in section  [ sec : seclsquarks ] we present the theoretical framework , by introducing the notation for particles and couplings .",
    "section  [ sec : qcd - corrections ] summarizes the results for the one - loop qcd - corrections to the squark partial decay widths into charginos and neutralinos .",
    "a few details about the effective description approach described in  @xcite are given in this section .",
    "this will allow readers to know what we have coded into our effective mssm model for squarks within madgraph . in section  [ sec : mc ]",
    "we describe our monte - carlo tool implementation of the mssm effective couplings .",
    "section  [ sec : resultsnumerical ] presents the numerical analysis : numerical setup and parameter choices ( section  [ sec : numericalsetup ] ) , partial decay widths analysis ( section  [ resultsgamma ] ) , and cross - section results ( section  [ sec : crosssection ] ) .",
    "finally section  [ sec : conclusions ] shows our conclusions .",
    "here we introduce our notation for susy particles and couplings . throughout this work",
    "we will use a third - generation notation to describe quarks and squarks , but the analytic results and conclusions are completely general , and can be used for quarks - squarks of any generation .",
    "we will show numerical results only for top - squarks ( @xmath8 ) , since their signals are the most phenomenologically interesting .    to describe the computation of the partial decay widths",

    "we will study the partial decay widths of sfermions into fermions and charginos / neutralinos , @xmath9    we denote the two sfermion - mass eigenvalues by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",

    "the input parameters in the sfermion sector are then : @xmath34 for each sfermion doublet . from them , we can derive the masses and mixing angles : @xmath35 for the trilinear couplings , we require the approximate ( necessary ) condition @xmath36 to avoid colour - breaking minima in the mssm scalar potential . here",
    "@xmath37 is of the order of the average squark masses for @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the soft - susy - breaking mass parameter of the higgs fields , see   for details .",
    "although the tree - level chargino ( @xmath40)-neutralino ( @xmath41 ) sector is well known , we give here a short description , in order to set our conventions .",
    "we start by constructing the following set of weyl spinors : @xmath42 the mass lagrangian in this basis reads @xmath43 where we have defined @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 the @xmath19 and @xmath47 soft - susy - breaking gaugino masses .",

    "the coupling matrices that encode the dynamics are given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 the weak hypercharges of the left - handed @xmath68 doublet and right - handed singlet fermion , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the yukawa couplings normalized to the @xmath68 gauge coupling constant @xmath71 .",

    "it is known that qcd corrections to the squark partial decay widths into charginos and neutralinos can be numerically large , specially in certain regions of the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "an effective description of squark / chargino / neutralino couplings , simple to write and to introduce in computer codes , was given in  @xcite .",

    "we present the results of the implementation of the effective description in madgraph s mssm framework .",
    "while the ew corrections can be important in some regions of the parameter space , they do not admit a simple effective description as the one described here , and therefore one can not compute an approximation to the cross - section as the one performed in the present work .    in the following we present few details of the effective description approach as given in @xcite .",
    "in this approach , following hints from higgs - boson physics , an effective yukawa coupling is defined as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the running quark mass and @xmath79 is the finite threshold correction .",
    "the susy - qcd contributions to @xmath79 are @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the scalar three - point function at zero momentum transfer : @xmath82 the effective description of the squark interaction consist in replacing the tree - level quark masses in the couplings  ( [ eq : v1apm ] ) by the effective yukawa couplings of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) , and use this lagrangian to compute the partial decay width , schematically @xmath83 ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "this expression contains the large one - loop corrections from the finite threshold corrections  ( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) , but it also contains higher order corrections . at this point",
    "one can make a computation that combines the higher order effects ( which ignore the effects of external momenta ) and the fixed one - loop ( which ignore the higher order effects ) . at the same time , this will allow us to quantify the degree of accuracy obtained by the effective description . a _",
    "yukawa - improved decay width computation _ have been defined in  @xcite and they showed that the effective description using just the yukawa threshold corrections  ( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) is not enough for the squark decay widths description .",
    "the one - loop corrections develop a term which grows as the gluino mass @xmath84  @xcite , which is absent in the effective yukawa couplings  ( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the qcd corrections to squark decay widths produce explicit non - decoupling terms of the sort @xmath85 .",
    "to understand those terms a renormalization group analysis is in order  @xcite .",
    "they constructed an effective theory below the gluino mass scale , which contains only squarks , quarks , charginos , neutralinos and gluons in the light sector of the theory , and integrate out the gluino contributions .",
    "then , they found out the renormalization group equations ( rge ) of the gaugino and higgsino couplings , and performed the matching with the full mssm couplings at the gluino mass scale @xmath84 .",
    "only the logarithmic rge effects have been considered , neglecting the possible threshold effects at the gluino mass scale .",
    "since the effective theory does not contain gluinos , only the contributions from the gluon have to be taken into account .",
    "we do not present here details of the renormalization group analysis and we restrict ourselves to give the results that are relevant for our purpose .",
    "the squark - chargino running coupling constant as a function of the gauge and higgs boson couplings at the renormalization scale @xmath22 , up to @xmath86 , is given by  @xcite : @xmath87 the @xmath85 term arises as a factor to each higgsino ( @xmath73 ) or gaugino ( @xmath72 ) term , eq .",
    "( [ twoterms ] ) .",
    "note that the expressions for the higgsino and gaugino couplings are different due to the different running of the gauge and higgs - boson couplings between the scales @xmath84 and @xmath22 .",
    "the same can be safely extended to the rest of the couplings in ( [ eq : v1apm ] ) .",
    "then , the renormalization group running of the coupling constant can be summarized as follows : we can use effective gaugino and higgsino couplings given by  @xcite , @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the effective yukawa couplings defined in  ( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) , and @xmath90 is the qcd @xmath91-function . at this point , a simple expression for the effective description of squark / chargino/ neutralino couplings is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hbhbteff1 ] ) , ( [ eq : deltamq ] ) , ( [ eq : logterms ] ) .",
    "ref.@xcite showed that the effective description  ( [ eq : logterms ] ) approximates the _ improved _ computation to within @xmath92 for large enough gluino masses ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the effects of the log - terms are better visible in the gaugino - like channels , where the yukawa couplings play no role , and the bulk of the corrections corresponds to the log - terms . in the higgsino - like channels their importance is less apparent . after introducing these expressions in computer",
    "codes a reasonable description for squark decays into charginos and neutralinos is accomplished .",
    "they can be used in monte - carlo generators and other computer programs that provide predictions for the lhc and the ilc to improve their accuracy , requiring little computational costs .",
    "the effective couplings of section  [ sec : qcd - corrections ] have been implemented in a standard monte - carlo tool to allow their use in multiple processes .",
    "we have chosen to include them in the madgraph / madevent framework  @xcite .",
    "the program madgraph  @xcite automatically generates fortran code to calculate arbitrary tree - level helicity amplitudes .",
    "its later implementation , the madgraph / madevent package  @xcite , allows the computation of physical processes at the partonic or hadronic level , and includes interfaces to hadronization routines .",
    "recent additions allow also to compute the partial decay widths of unstable particles  @xcite .",
    "a number of physical models are supplied with the standard version of madgraph / madevent , aside from the sm , we will be using the mssm implementation  @xcite .",
    "for our computation , we use madgraph / madevent 5.1.4.8  @xcite , and we make heavy use of its possibility to extend / modify internal physical models .",
    "madgraph accepts inputs in the form of susy les houches accord ( slha )  @xcite file format , which allows easy interfacing with programs computing susy spectra and susy particles decay widths .",
    "we have modified madgraph s standard mssm file , changing the squark - quark - neutralino / chargino vertices by the ones of expression  ( [ eq : logterms ] ) . using our model file , we are able to compute any physical processes involving these vertices , including the leading radiative corrections .    in section  [ resultsgamma ] we compute the partial decay widths of squarks , using the recent addition to madgraph implemented in  @xcite .",
    "these results are checked against an independent implementation of the partial decay widths in programs based in the feynarts / formcalc / looptools  @xcite ( fafclt ) chain , which were used in ref.@xcite .",
    "our set of fafclt - based programs prepares a standard slha  @xcite input file , which contains the susy inputs , as well as the susy spectrum and mixing matrices .",
    "this slha file is then used as input for both , the madgraph - based and the fafclt - based computation . in this way we can make meaningful comparisons of the output of both computations .",
    "we find that both computations agree among them ( see section [ resultsgamma ] ) and with ref.@xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : crosssection ] we use our madgraph - based programs to compute the production cross - section of squarks decaying into chargino / neutralino .",
    "we generate an slha input file with our set of fafclt - based programs , which we use as input for madgraph .",
    "madgraph needs the full decay width of on - shell particles for the treatment of resonant propagators , while our decay programs ( fafclt- or madgraph - based ) can only compute the fermionic decay channels .",
    "we use sdecay 1.1a  @xcite for the computation of the bosonic decay channels partial decay widths . all along the computation",
    "a single slha file is used for all steps , ensuring consistency among the different inputs / outputs .",
    "the computing flow is the following :    1 .",
    "we use the fafclt - based programs to write a standard slha input file , which includes the susy inputs as well as the susy particle masses and mixing matrices ; 2 .",
    "we use this file as input for sdecay to obtain the squark decay tables at the tree - level ; 3 .   then",
    ", we use our set of fafclt - based programs to replace , in the above file , the squark partial decay widths into charginos / neutralinos , and the full decay width , by using the effective coupling approach ; 4 .",
    "this slha file is used as an input for the madgraph / madevent cross - section computation , which uses the input section for its internal parameter setup , and the full decay width in the resonant particles propagators .    in this way a cross - section at the parton level in the final state is obtained .",
    "madgraph / madevent interfaces may process further this output through parton showers , hadronization and detector simulation packages , however this analysis is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "our programs are able to perform computations for any mssm parameter space point .",
    "they admit slha@xcite input for easy interaction with other programs / routines . as an example of the effects of the new included terms",
    ", we will show numerical analysis for fixed values of the susy parameters , and make plots by changing one parameter at a time .",
    "on one side , we choose a set of susy parameters as described below ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : susyparams ] ) and ( [ eq : physicalmasses ] ) ) and , on the other side , susy parameters are chosen from the _ snowmass points and slopes _",
    "( sps )  @xcite set .",
    "it should be noted that some of the sps scenarios are already in conflict with lhc data  @xcite , but we have chosen them as reference points to perform our computation since they have been studied at length in the literature .",
    "the results for the decay widths serve as a test of correct implementation , they are checked against previous computer programs@xcite .",
    "first , we take for the central values of the parameters : @xmath100 where we have introduced a parameter @xmath101 as a shortcut for all the susy mass parameters which are not explicitly given .",
    "we use the grand unification relation @xmath102 for the bino mass parameter .",
    "the value of the trilinear couplings @xmath30 is given by the algebraic expression , the given numerical value corresponds to the default values of the other parameters , this numerical value will change in the plots , the chosen expression allows to show plots with a significant parameter variation avoiding colour - breaking - vacuum conditions  ( [ eq : necessary ] ) .",
    "the gluino mass is chosen to be large to enhance the effects of the logarithmic terms .",
    "note also that if the gluino decay channel is open , it will be the dominant decay channel for squarks , rendering the chargino / neutralino channels phenomenologically irrelevant .",
    "therefore our region of interest is : @xmath103 with these input parameters , the central values for the physical susy particle masses are : @xmath104 of course , the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : susyparams ] ) are just an example for illustrative purposes .",
    "we denote this parameter choice `` _ _ def _ _ '' in the numerical analysis below .",
    "in addition we will be analyzing the following parameter space points from the sps@xcite collection : 1b , 3 , 7 ( see below ) .",
    "the corresponding values of the parameters are reproduced in appendix  [ sec : sps ] .",
    "we have checked that our conclusions hold for a wide range of the parameter space .    at present the atlas collaboration",
    "has already put some limits on the top - squark mass from pair production@xcite , the largest excluded top - squark mass at 95% c.l .",
    "is @xmath105@xcite assuming @xmath106 .",
    "our top - squark mass parameter choices are larger than the excluded ones , moreover the exclusion limits would be loosened by allowing the existence of several decay channels for the top - squark .",
    "our aim is the computation of the production cross - section , however , some of the numerical features of the production cross - section are traceable to the numerical behaviour of the partial and total decay widths .",
    "for this reason we show in the present section a short numerical analysis of the partial decay widths of top - squarks into charginos and neutralinos , following the computation and setup of the previous sections .",
    "we show detailed results only for the sps scenarios , since the _ def _ scenario  ( [ eq : susyparams ] ) has been largely explored in  @xcite .    first of all",
    ", we have made a complete check of our fafclt - based and madgraph - based computations , both at the tree - level and effective approximations , and we have found perfect agreement between both methods .",
    "we have checked explicitly that for all possible squarks decay channels into charginos and neutralinos the relative deviations between both methods of calculations is within the precision of madgraph s monte - carlo numerical integrations ( smaller than @xmath107 , and typically of the order of @xmath108 ) .",
    "the analysis of the accuracy of the effective approximation was performed in ref.@xcite , using the parameter set _",
    "def _  ( [ eq : susyparams ] ) as an example .",
    "we have additionally checked that the same conclusions hold for the sps scenarios analyzed in the present work , namely that the effective approximation provides a good description of the radiative - corrected partial decay widths , if the gluino mass is heavier than the top - squark mass ( @xmath109 ) .    for future reference , we comment briefly on the partial decay widths in the _ def _  ( [ eq : susyparams ] ) scenario without showing any plots , details are available in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this scenario , in the explored range of gluino masses , the corrections shrink in more than a @xmath7 the full decay width of squarks compared to the tree - level result , and the effect is highly noticed for @xmath110 growing up to a @xmath111 in some regions of the parameter space . as expected , the largest difference with respect to the tree - level calculation is achieved at the largest gluino mass evaluated .",
    "we have made a complete numerical analysis for the snowmass points and slopes parameters : sps1b , sps3 , sps5 and sps7 .",
    "sps5 provides a very narrow range of useful susy parameters for our investigation due to a relatively light scalar top quark , therefore we are not showing these results in the present paper .",
    "the other sps parameters are away of the range of susy parameters interesting for our analysis .",
    "notice that the gluino mass is around @xmath112 for the three points mentioned above , and therefore the effects of the logarithmic terms is not as enhanced as in the _ def _  ( [ eq : susyparams ] ) scenario , where @xmath113 .",
