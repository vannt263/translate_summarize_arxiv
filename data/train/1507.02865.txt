    "a time - lag of several millennia between the discoveries of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ( nel ) order , despite their great microscopic similarity , underscores the importance of the availability of experimental probes matching the phenomena in question .",
    "the lack of a characteristic macroscopic observable for the nel state has an analogy today in the lack of _ any _ local ground state signatures of topological states of matter , for which the most natural diagnostics  entanglement entropy or topological degeneracies  are not readily accessible to present experimental technology .",
    "the identification of clear - cut experimental signatures is all the more urgent  after a frustratingly long search following the original proposal of quantum spin - liquid states  @xcite ,",
    "there is no longer any shortage of theoretical models exhibiting ` topological ' quantum spin liquid states  @xcite ; and in the meantime , several frustrated magnetic materials have been identified as promising candidates to host qsl physics  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most natural local diagnostics for spin - liquidity involve the concomitant and characteristic fractionalised excitations above the featureless , long - range entangled , topologically degenerate ground states . due to the mismatch between the quantum numbers of such fractionalised excitations on one hand , and the selection rules for standard scattering probes on the other , experiments",
    "do not usually couple to a single fractionalised quasiparticle , instead exciting multiple quasiparticles , thereby producing a featureless continuum response .    the dynamical spin response , which can be probed using conventional experimental techniques such as inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) and electron spin resonance ( esr ) , is in principle sensitive to not only the ground state but also to a wide range of excited states , even at zero temperature .",
    "as such , it may in particular be sensitive to the presence of fractionalised excitations .",
    "study of the dynamical spin response has proven to be fruitful in applications to one - dimensional systems , where it allowed one to establish a quantitative correspondence between the theoretically predicted correlation functions ( obtained exactly using bethe - ansatz ) , and the results of inelastic neutron scattering measurements  @xcite , thereby confirming the presence of @xmath2 spinon excitations .    in the recent letter  @xcite we have commenced an analogous programme for a two - dimensional quantum spin liquid .",
    "the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite were based on an _ exact calculation _ of the dynamic structure factor for the celebrated 2d kitaev honeycomb model ( khm ) ; such exact results had thus far mainly been restricted to one dimension  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the kitaev model is remarkably simple , having only nearest - neighbour exchange .",
    "this simplicity has led to a number of theoretical proposals for its realization in condensed matter , and in cold atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "materials whose spin and orbital degrees of freedom are strongly entangled in presence of spin - orbit couplings , such as  \\{na , li}@xmath3iro@xmath4 iridates  @xcite , and more recently  @xmath5-rucl@xmath4  @xcite , are currently the most promising candidates to realise kitaev physics .",
    "some of these are believed to be in the proximity of a quantum spin liquid state .",
    "remarkably , residual high energy features of these putative qsls might have already been observed in present systems  @xcite , despite the fact that the latter are known to form a long - range ordered phase .",
    "the khm represents one of the exceedingly rare instances of a tractable strongly - interacting quantum system in two spatial dimensions  @xcite . as a representative of a broader class of qsls",
    "whose emergent degrees of freedom are majorana fermions and @xmath0 gauge fluxes , it has become an archetype for a qsl . despite being formulated a decade ago",
    ", it still holds surprises , and is being actively studied , e.g.  in the contexts of the calculations of ground state degeneracy  @xcite , entanglement entropy  @xcite , transitions between different topological phases  @xcite , disorder effects  @xcite , global quench dynamics  @xcite , and the effects of doping  @xcite .",
    "there exist a number of integrable generalizations of the model  @xcite , as well as its three - dimensional extensions  @xcite .",
    "while the calculation of the time - independent correlators is simple when expressed in appropriate variables  @xcite , the calculation of dynamical correlators has turned out to be considerably less straightforward . as noted already in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to map this calculation onto a non - equilibrium problem involving a quantum quench of a local potential , the physics which closely resembles the venerable x - ray edge singularity problem  @xcite .    here",
    ", we aim to provide a _ complete theory of the dynamical spin - response in two - dimensional kitaev qsls_. we consider various different spin liquids  both gapped and gapless abelian as well as gapped non - abelian",
    ". the latter can appear upon breaking time - reversal symmetry , and is of special interest due to proposals of using its non - abelian excitations for topological quantum computations .",
    "for all of these , we provide the numerically exact dynamical structure factor , extending our recent work in ref .  [ ]    we find a rich phenomenology , in which each of the considered qsls appears with distinctive signatures of the emergent fluxes and the majorana fermions .",
    "some of these properties are rather surprising , such as the appearance of a gap in the response for a gapless qsl , and the existence of a sharp ( delta - function ) response even for a fractionalised ( both gapless and gapped ) spin liquid .",
    "the explanation of the various features of the response are natural and simple in terms of the fractionalised degrees of freedom , e.g.  involving the gap to a state with a pair of fluxes ; or a bound state of the majorana modes expected for a p - wave superconductor hamiltonian representing the non - abelian qsl .",
    "it would seem hard even to rationalise these phenomena in an alternative language .",
    "therefore , this ensemble of results can be seen as a rather direct validation of the fractionalised picture ; given its richness , we do not provide a detailed list of our results in the introduction , and instead devote section [ secsummary ] to a non - technical account of our central results , which has been written with a reader in mind who is interested in phenomena but not too concerned about technical details .",
    "finding the exact solutions presented here has led us to engage in a fair amount of method development .",
    "much of the more technical material included here aims to give a reasonably self - contained account of this .",
    "we have in fact developed a number of complementary approaches , both exact ( for finite systems based on determinant representation of correlation functions , and in the thermodynamic limit using singular integral equations ) and approximate but simple ( which we call the adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that these should have applicability well beyond the present context .",
    "much of this technical material has been collected into a set of appendices .",
    "while this paper presents an exact treatment of a particular model qsl , its features should for the usual reasons be relevant to a much wider range of qsls , qualitatively and ( semi-)quantitatively .",
    "namely , the gap in the response , which originates from the flux gap , the broad continuum due to spin - fractionalization , and the sharp delta - function response due to dynamical rearrangement of majorana density of states , might hold for qsls whose low - energy degrees of freedom are heavy fluxes of gauge - field coupled to dispersive fractionalized excitations .",
    "these points are discussed as part of our closing outlook section .",
    "the structure of the remainder of this paper is the following . in section [ seckhm ]",

    "@xcite : the structure factor contains contributions only from on - site and nearest - neighbour correlators , and only those with the same spin - component .",
    "this is a consequence of the static nature of the emergent @xmath0 gauge fluxes . as a result , there are no sharp features in reciprocal space  in itself of course a classic ` necessary but not sufficient ' diagnostic of spin liquid behaviour  so that we restrict our plots in fig .  [ schematic1 ] to @xmath33 .",
    "the next and considerably more surprising result is that , in all cases , the dynamical response is gapped , regardless of whether or not the underlying spin liquid phase has an excitation gap .",
    "the minimal gap in the response is given by the energy difference between the ground state and the lowest - energy state with a flux pair in adjacent plaquettes .",
    "one component of the above - gap response is broad in energy and results from majorana fermion excitations .",
    "its low - energy onset is at the two - flux gap in the phase with gapless majorana excitations , but is higher in energy in the gapped majorana phase .",
    "as we discuss below , this broad response is due mainly to either single - fermion or two - fermion excitations , depending on spin component and hamiltonian parameters .",
    "a further striking aspect of the dynamical response is that it includes in some instances sharp ( @xmath1-function ) components in frequency space , a remarkable feature in view of the fact that all independent quasiparticle excitations of the model are fractionalised and so can not be created individually by the action of a local operator such as @xmath34 . in our discussion",
    "below , we identify two distinct physical mechanisms by which these sharp contributions arise .",
    "one mechanism involves ` zero - fermion ' transitions , in which only @xmath35 fluxes and no majorana fermions are excited ; the other stems from the bound states that are characteristic of vortices in this kind of non - abelian spin liquid .",
    "while the excitation spectrum of the khm is independent of the sign of exchange interactions , the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic models are clearly distinguished by the @xmath36-dependence of their response . viewed in direct space ,",

    "[ secresultabelian ] .",
    "much of the behaviour summarised in fig .  [ schematic1 ] can be understood starting from a selection rule for majorana excitations .",

    "the states @xmath32 that contribute to lehmann expression , eq .",
    "( [ lehmann ] ) , for the dynamical structure factor are ones with non - zero matrix elements @xmath39 .",
    "expressed in terms of @xmath35 fluxes and majorana fermions , they obey selection rules which we now discuss .",
    "the flux selection rule is very simple ( see also @xcite ) : the action of @xmath40 inserts fluxes through the plaquettes either side of the bond @xmath41 , as illustrated in fig .  [ latticeflux ] .",
    "since the ground state @xmath42 is flux - free and fluxes are static , @xmath32 contains this flux pair and no others .    ]    to introduce the selection rule involving majorana fermions , consider in the first instance the ferromagnetic abelian khm deep in the gapped phase , with @xmath43 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is then natural to discuss energy eigenstates in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath44 , and for states in this basis to count the number @xmath45 of neighboring pairs of spins @xmath46 that are antiparallel .",
    "one can define a spin parity operator @xmath47 .",
    "the kitaev hamiltonian commutes with @xmath48 and so all energy eigenstates can be chosen to have a definite parity . moreover , @xmath48 is unchanged by the action of a single @xmath44 operator , but is reversed by the action of a single @xmath49 or @xmath50 operator .",
    "hence the ground state @xmath42 couples only to states @xmath51 with the _",
    "opposite _ parity for the structure factor components having @xmath52 , and only to states @xmath32 with _ same _ parity for the component with @xmath53 .",
    "deep in the gapped phase the lowest energy wave function for majorana fermions in any flux sector has predominantly @xmath54 , and therefore belongs to the @xmath55 sector .",
    "the higher energy states with single majorana fermion excitations consist mostly of one antiparallel spin pair and belong to the @xmath56 sector .",
    "they form an energy band that is centred on @xmath57 and has a width set by @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "components of @xmath60 with @xmath52 therefore arise in this part of the phase diagram only from states @xmath32 that contain odd numbers of fermion excitations .",
    "their main weight is due to single fermion excitations and is concentrated in a band near @xmath61 .",
    "these components also have some weight in higher bands near odd multiples of @xmath57 , but this turns out to be very small .",
    "conversely , the component with @xmath53 involves only states with an even number of matter fermion excitations .",
    "the lowest in energy of these is simply the unique excited state @xmath62 containing no matter fermions and only the added flux pair . since the matrix element @xmath63 involving this state is non - zero , it contributes to @xmath60 a @xmath1-function with finite weight at frequency @xmath64 .",
    "higher energy contributions form bands around even multiples of @xmath57 .",
    "we find a dynamical transition at which this @xmath1-function in the structure factor disappears on moving through the phase diagram .",
    "the mechanism is as follows .",
    "away from the limit @xmath65 , the parities of the ground states in the relevant flux sectors ( zero - flux and the three two - flux states that have flux pairs either side of @xmath66 , @xmath67 or @xmath68 bonds ) are no longer necessarily even .",
    "in fact , their relative parities change on a line shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic1](ii ) .",
    "all four ground states have the same parity for @xmath65 , but near @xmath69 the ground state with a flux pair across a @xmath68-bond has opposite @xmath48 parity to the other three ground states . as a result , there is no @xmath1-function contribution to any component of @xmath60 in this phase .",
    "note that the boundary on which this dynamical transition occurs is distinct from the previously - known thermodynamic boundary between the gapless and gapped phases , in fact lying within the gapless phase .",
    "of course , similar arguments can be constructed using parity operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 based on the other components of spin , leading to the conclusion for the abelian model that @xmath60 has a @xmath1-function contribution in a region of the phase diagram where @xmath10 is dominant , but not elsewhere .",
    "there is also a second mechanism that may generate a sharp contribution in the response .",
    "it is operative if the spectrum of majorana fermion excitations that contributes to @xmath72 includes an isolated level , separate from continuous bands .",
    "let @xmath73 be the state containing only a flux pair and this fermion excitation .",
    "provided @xmath74 is finite , this state contributes to @xmath60 a @xmath1-function at frequency @xmath75 .",
    "this is the case at some values of @xmath76 in the extended khm , for @xmath52 within both dynamical phases , and for @xmath53 in the dynamical phase that includes the isotropic point . here",
    "the isolated level is a majorana bound state trapped on the flux pair that is introduced into @xmath77 by the action of @xmath78 .",
    "it is known that flux excitations in the non - abelian phase carry bound states of majorana fermions , and these spatially localized states appear below the gap of the single - particle majorana fermion continuum  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss more fully the behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic1 ] , where we set @xmath79 so that there are only two distinct components of the response : @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "schematic results for the structure factor in kitaev abelian qsl phases are shown in panels ( a ) - ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ schematic1 ] ( i ) .    in the isotropic model",
    "( a ) @xmath82 is non - zero above the energy cost @xmath83 for introduction of a flux pair .",
    "its dominant weight arises from single majorana fermion excitations , but a tail continues to higher energy .",
    "although the energy width of the majorana fermion band determines the extent of the main response , the energy - dependence of the intensity has no simple relation to the magnitude of the majorana density of states , because the response involves fermion propagation in the presence of a flux pair .",
    "it nevertheless reflects features such as the van - hove singularity .",
    "in the anisotropic model ( b ) there are distinct responses @xmath84 and @xmath80 , including different flux gaps , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . within the gapless phase , both components have non - zero contributions above the respective flux gap .",
    "in addition , beyond the dynamical phase boundary @xmath80 has a @xmath1-function contribution at @xmath87 .    in the gapped abelian phase ( c ) the @xmath1-function in @xmath80 at @xmath87 persists , but there is an energy gap separating it from the two - fermion continuum around @xmath88 .",
    "by contrast , @xmath84 has no @xmath1-function component and is dominated by a single - fermion continuum around @xmath61 .",
    "the response in the non - abelian phase ( @xmath9 and @xmath89 ) has features that are distinct from the ones which we find for the model with @xmath8 .",
    "they arise because there are bound states of majorana fermions associated with flux pairs .    at the isotropic point",
    "( d ) this composite flux - fermion bound state manifests itself as a single sharp component in the dynamic structure factor , that would be absent from the corresponding abelian phase . with anisotropy ( e )",
    "the energies of sharp contributions to @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the sum of the fermion bound state energy and the two - flux gap , @xmath85 or @xmath86 , and therefore unequal .",
    "the main features of the response described above are robust against , for example , the addition of weak heisenberg interactions to the kitaev hamiltonian , since spin - parity remains a good quantum number .",
    "the most important consequence of such additional interactions is that fluxes acquire dynamics .",
    "this will broaden the response around @xmath92 , but we expect that it will remain always gapped , and that distinct contributions to components of @xmath93 from states with zero , one and two matter fermion excitations will continue to be identifiable .",
    "the extended khm model can be solved exactly following the original approach of kitaev  @xcite .",
    "we introduce four majorana fermion species @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath11 on every lattice site @xmath28 .",
    "these fermions obey the anti - commutation relations @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "spin operators can be represented in terms of @xmath98 and @xmath99 as @xmath100    next , we define bond operators @xmath101 with @xmath14 labelling nearest neighbour sites at the ends of bond @xmath15 . in terms of the bond operators @xmath102 and the matter fermions @xmath98 , the hamiltonian of the extended khm reads    @xmath103    bond operators are constants of motion with the eigenvalues @xmath104 .",
    "thus the hilbert space in which @xmath105 acts can be decomposed into ` gauge ' @xmath106 and ` matter ' @xmath107 sectors . replacing the bond operators by their eigenvalues we arrive at a hamiltonian which is quadratic in majorana fermions , and thus can be diagonalised .",
