    "2009 ; patel et al .",
    "anyway , the rest - frame uvj color and ssfr are dependent on the determination of photometric redshift .",
    "although photometric redshift now can be measured with relatively small error ( e.g. ilbert et al . 2009 ) , the measurement of photometric redshift may vary from person to person , depending on the adopted sed - fitting codes and sed libraries .",

    "combined with local sdss data and candels - goods - south data at @xmath11 ( szomoru et al .",
    "2013 ) , the mass - normalized size evolution can be described well with @xmath56 up to @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 size scatter ( @xmath59 ) of our pvjls sample is large ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the previous findings based on the data at @xmath61 ( e.g. newman et al .",

    "2013 ) .",
    "the srsic  indices can determine the distribution of light and can be suggestive of a bulge or disk component .",
    "the axis ratio distribution provides a better constraint on the shapes of galaxies .",
    "we examine srsic  index of our pvjl galaxies taken from van der wel et al .",
    "the srsic  index of our pvjl galaxies at @xmath5 are relatively lower compared to the @xmath16 qgs .",
    "the median srsic  index n is 1.5 . and 13 out of 19 galaxies have @xmath62 . the large fraction with low n indicates that the structure of our pvjl galaxies at @xmath5 may be mostly disk - dominated , same as the situation at @xmath16 ( van der wel et al .",
    "we also examine the axis ratios of our pvjl galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "the median axis ratio is @xmath63 .",
    "9 out of 19 pvjl galaxies have @xmath64 , also indicating a disk - like structure .",
    "in this section , we will estimate the stellar mass surface density profiles of our pvjl galaxies at @xmath5 and compare it with those at lower redshift . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the radial gradients in the mass - to - light ratio and use the best - fitting srsic  profile representing the mass profile for each galaxy .",
    "a srsic  function is written as @xmath65)\\ ] ] here @xmath66 is the surface brightness at radius @xmath67 , @xmath51 is the effective radius , @xmath68 is the surface brightness at radius @xmath51 and @xmath69 is the srsic  index .",
    "the constant @xmath70 can be determined from the condition that the luminosity inside @xmath51 is half the total luminosity , which has a numerical solution ( see prugniel & simien 1997 ) : @xmath71 neglecting the radial gradients in the mass - to - light ratio , the stellar mass inside radius r can be written as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath36 is stellar mass of the whole galaxy , @xmath74 is the incomplete @xmath75 function .",
    "so basically , we can compute the stellar mass surface density profile if having only effective radius @xmath51 , srsic  index n and stellar mass @xmath36 . for 19 pvjl galaxies at @xmath5 , we compute the individual stellar mass surface density profiles and the corresponding median profile at each radius . our result is plotted in figure 4 with solid lines ( thick line : median profile ; thin lines : individual profiles ) .",
    "we compare the median mass profile of our pvjl galaxies with those of qgs at @xmath76 and @xmath16 ( szomoru et al .",
    "2013 ) and local etgs ( huang et al . 2013 ) .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we re - calculate the mass profiles of quiescent galaxies in szomoru et al .",
    "( 2013 ) by neglecting radial gradients in the mass - to - light ratio . in figure 4",
    ", we can find that the median mass profiles at different redshifts are very similar in the inner region ( within @xmath77 kpc ) .",
    "anyway , we need notice that the median mass profiles are very uncertain at @xmath78 kpc , which is the approximate psf hwhm at @xmath4 . despite the similarity , the median mass profiles at different redshifts already show some difference at @xmath79 kpc .",
    "this difference is likely due to the large uncertainty of the median profiles in the small samples at @xmath80 . the difference is greater at larger radii ( @xmath81 kpc ) .",
    "figure 4 shows clearly the surface mass density increases with decreasing redshift at @xmath82 kpc .",
    "the effective radii ( marked with the colorful arrows ) also increase with decreasing redshift .",
    "one possible indication is most of stars in the inner region of local massive etgs have been presented in place even since @xmath5 .",
    "this result is consistent with the inside - out formation scenario in which the compact galaxies at high redshift make up the cores of local massive etgs and then build up the outskirts according to dissipationless minor mergers ( e.g. , loeb & peebles 2003 , hopkins et al .",
    "patel et al . ( 2013 ) also studied the evolution in the surface mass density profiles by using candels hst wfc3 imaging in the ukidss - uds .",
    "they confirmed that most of the mass at @xmath83 kpc was in place by @xmath16 , and that most of the new mass growth occurred at larger radii .",
    "however , they found the stellar mass appears to grow in the inner part of the galaxy from @xmath5 to @xmath16 .",
    "the difference of the evolution in the surface mass density profiles from @xmath5 to @xmath16 may be due to the different sample selection methods .",
    "we compare the median mass profiles at different redshifts with _ equal _ stellar mass ( @xmath84 ) , while patel et al .",
    "( 2013 ) selected the massive galaxies at constant cumulative number density .",
    "their subsample at @xmath85 has a stellar mass of @xmath86 , which is two times less massive than ours .",
    "in this letter , we try to use a two - color ( ( @xmath0 ) vs. ( @xmath1 ) ) selection criteria ( so - called pvjl selection , guo et al .",
    "2012 ) to select massive , quiescent galaxy candidates at @xmath2 in the candels - cosmos field .",
    "the preliminary pvjl sample contains a lot of contaminations , which are mostly the highly obscured star forming galaxies from both lower ( @xmath39 ) and higher ( @xmath40 redshifts . and agns are another possible contamination , though they can only contribute a tiny fraction . following the work in guo et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , we use several conditions to clean our pvjl sample .",
    "finally , 19 pvjl galaxies have been selected fulfilling all our massive , quiescent galaxy conditions at @xmath5 .",
    "the caveat is there may be the remaining contamination from dusty sfgs in our pvjl sample . though we try to clean sample by using available data , such as spitzer 24 @xmath17 detection , specific star formation rate based on the sed best - fitting result , it s still not adequate due to the poor limit of shallower 24@xmath17 on star formation rate and the age - attenuation degeneracy of sed fitting . further deeper submm / mm observation may help purify the quiescent sample .    by comparing our pvjl galaxies with local etgs in the mass - size plane , we find that the sizes of our pvjl galaxies are on average 3 - 4 times smaller than those of the local etgs with analogous stellar mass",
    ". the compact size of these @xmath5 galaxies can be modelled by assuming their formation at @xmath6 according to the dissipative collapse of baryons .",

    "the large scatter of size distribution @xmath59 is also present in our pvjl sample at @xmath5",
    ". the remaining contamination from dusty sfgs may be also possibly corresponding to the large size scatter at @xmath5 . or repeated agn feedback may help explain the increasing size scatter with redshift ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2013 ) . by examining the srsic  index and axis ratios",
    ", we find a significant fraction of our pvjl galaxies is disk - dominated .",
    "we need mention that the size comparison between massive quiescent galaxies with _ equal _ stellar mass at @xmath5 and at @xmath16 may be not straightforward here .",
    "the progenitors of @xmath16 massive compact galaxies are compact star - forming galaxies at @xmath87 ( barro et al .",
    "2013 ; stefanon et al .",
    "2013 ) , which are excluded in this work according to the ssfr selection criteria . and",
    "our pvjl galaxies could be the possible progenitors of even more massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath16 .    by comparing the median stellar mass surface density profile of our pvjl galaxies with those of qgs at @xmath76 and @xmath16 and local etgs .",
    "an important result is most of stars in the inner region ( @xmath88 kpc ) of local massive etgs have been presented in place as early as @xmath5 .",
