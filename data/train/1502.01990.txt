    "the map we have described between the octagon and the square can hence be generalised to more vortices on a higher genus surface ( see also sections [ comphiggsfield ] and [ highergenus ] ) .      before proceeding any further , we should investigate whether the map @xmath36 can be expressed as an infinite blaschke product with zeros of @xmath36 occurring at the same density as vortices , mimicking the way this was done for the one - dimensional vortex array ( [ jacobi ] , [ infprod ] ) . for @xmath36 of the form with @xmath126 , this will be the case if the blaschke condition holds .",

    "the map @xmath36 between the polygonal tessellations of the poincar disk described in section [ fproperties ] is easy to implement because the position of the vortex is consistent with a regular tiling of the fundamental polygon by congruent triangles with a shared vertex at the vortex position .",
    "this procedure avoids mapping directly between the octagon and the square , which would introduce a large number of additional _ accessory parameters _ which would then need to be determined .",

    "we sketch how the riemann map is constructed for curvilinear polygons before specialising to the case of triangles , where one can obtain explicit results .",

    "it is conformal everywhere except at the @xmath149 points @xmath150 on the real axis which map to the vertices of the polygon .",
    "the requirement that the image of the map should extend to the entire poincar disk by a series of reflections leads to an @xmath151-invariant differential equation satisfied by the function @xmath152 representing the map .",

    "there is no closed form expression for @xmath160 , so we use a parametric approach :  picking an arbitrary point on the @xmath154 plane will tell us the value of @xmath10 at @xmath162 .",

    "we note from figure [ contours ] that the midpoints of the edges of the octagon are saddle points of @xmath26 .",

    "when a single vortex on @xmath52 is replaced by an @xmath84 tessellation of vortices , we integrate the flux of the single vortex over the fundamental octagon of figure [ figoct ] . as a fraction of the total flux , we find @xmath225showing that the lattice of vortices compresses the flux by about @xmath226 .",
    "the vortex equations on surfaces with @xmath227 can be studied using similar arguments to those given in the preceding sections .",
    "the obvious extension of our construction is to a vortex at the origin of the poincar disk in the hyperbolic tessellation with schlfli symbol @xmath228 .",

    "the higgs field can again be computed by dividing the dodecagon into congruent triangles .",
    "placing @xmath249 vortices at the origin and @xmath250 at the vertex of the dodecagon requires a map @xmath36 with ramification of order @xmath251 at the origin and @xmath252 at the vertex .",

    "the image of the @xmath267-gon is a heptagon in the @xmath269 tessellation , and we obtain a vortex with @xmath270 symmetry with @xmath271 and @xmath272 .      a case of special interest is the @xmath248 tessellation with one vortex placed at the origin of the dodecagon and one at the vertex .",
    "the image tessellation is of type @xmath273 .",
    "the leading behaviour of the higgs field near each vortex is @xmath274 we find the same leading coefficient when placing a single vortex at the origin of a dodecagon in the @xmath275 tessellation .",
    "this result is due to the existence of a fixed - point - free @xmath276 action on the genus @xmath265 surface which identifies the origin and vertex of the @xmath248 tessellation .",
    "quotienting by this group gives a smooth compact genus @xmath11 surface with one vortex on it .",
    "this procedure is only possible when the vortex locations are compatible with the @xmath276 symmetry , and the quotient surface contains half the number of vortices .",

    "this genus @xmath39 surface is a double cover of @xmath100 with @xmath278 ramification points .",
    "the ramification points at the north and south poles correspond to the centre and vertex of the polygon , and there are @xmath233 equally spaced ramification points on the equator .",
    "generalising what was discussed in section [ hypertilings ] for the @xmath241 bolza surface , the cyclic @xmath279 symmetry has fixed points at the polygon centre and at the vertex , while there are @xmath39 @xmath280 symmetries with pairs of fixed points on the equator .",
    "the symmetry group of the surface is a double group of the dihedral group @xmath281 , and the hyperelliptic curve representing this setup is ) , the symmetry is enhanced to @xmath282 , a double cover of the cubic group . ]",
    "@xmath283the desired involution must map between the origin of the polygon and the vertex ( i.e.  between the poles of the sphere @xmath284 and @xmath285 ) and have no fixed points .",
    "this is only possible for @xmath39 odd ( the case @xmath39 even has fixed points at @xmath286 ) , in which case it is achieved by the involution @xmath287the quotient of the branched cover of @xmath100 by this involution is a double covering of the northern hemisphere with a particular identification of the segments of the equator between ramification points . in the polygon picture , there are @xmath230 edges to pair up .",
    "consistency with the transformation @xmath288 gives two possible pairings for each edge , due to the choice of branch .",
    "we also require the quotient surface to be smooth , which will be the case if there is no angle deficit at the identified vertices .",
    "the total internal angle of the quotient @xmath289 polygon is @xmath290 , hence there must be @xmath39 distinct vertices when the edges are paired .",
    "this imposes a further constraint on our choice of edge identifications .",
    "there is also the possibility that edge pairs can be twisted , although it is not clear whether our construction , which relies on @xmath10 extending from a fundamental triangle to all of @xmath52 by reflections , works in the twisted case .",
    "once the correct identifications have been made , the resulting surface has half the area of the original surface and genus @xmath291 .",
    "the identification described in the preceding paragraphs is illustrated for the @xmath242 case in figure [ dodecagon ] .",
    "the genus @xmath11 surface in the @xmath275 tessellation has different fenchel - nielsen parameters from the @xmath84 tessellation , and they therefore represent different surfaces .",
    "an immediate consequence of this is the different leading behaviour of the higgs field , as is seen by contrasting and .",
    "because a @xmath11-holed surface has no freely acting rotations by @xmath182 , the genus can not be reduced further .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to construct abelian - higgs vortices on compact hyperbolic surfaces which can be represented by tessellations of the hyperbolic plane by regular polygons .",
    "placing vortices on the surface breaks most of the symmetry , and our method requires the vortex positions to be chosen in such a way that there is a preserved symmetry allowing the surface to be covered by congruent triangles sharing vertices at the vortex positions .",
    "in particular , multivortex solutions can be constructed with vortices located at antipodal points on the surface , corresponding to the origin and vertex of the polygonal tessellation .",
    "the higgs field is computed by identifying a holomorphic function on the fundamental polygon which is conformal everywhere except at the vortex positions , where there is a ramification point of order one greater than the number of vortices at that location .",
    "this function can be expressed implicitly as the composition of two schwarz triangle functions , allowing numerical evaluation of the higgs field at any given point on the surface .",
    "there are several immediate generalisations of this procedure which it would be interesting to investigate further :    * the tessellation can be deformed such that the angles are fixed but the edge lengths change ( see figure [ def ] ) . in this case",
    "we require a map from a quadrant of the fundamental octagon to half a kite .",
    "the construction is analogous to that of the schwarz triangle map described in section [ solutions ] , with the hypergeometric differential equation replaced by the heun differential equation , which has four regular singular points .",
    "the difficulty with this construction is the appearance of an _ accessory parameter _ which characterises the deformation , and which requires numerical computation .",
    "a different deformation of the regular octagon was studied in @xcite .",

    "the riemann map from a hyperbolic polygon to the upper half plane is analytically continued to cover the poincar disk by reflection in the edges of the polygon .",
    "if the vortex is not positioned symmetrically then the fields can not be constructed by maps between regular polygons .",
    "as it stands , our construction only enables us to compute the fields at isolated points in the moduli space . *",
    "a final outstanding question is how to place an arbitrary number @xmath3 of vortices ( with @xmath292 ) at the origin of a symmetric tessellation describing a genus @xmath39 surface .",
    "an @xmath293-fold map from the fundamental polygon to a smaller polygon is only possible if @xmath122 divides the number of edges of the initial polygon .",
