    "dendritic spines are small protrusions from many types of neurons located on the surface of a neuronal dendrite .",
    "they receive most of the excitatory inputs and their physiological role is still unclear although most spines are thought to be key elements in neuronal information processing and plasticity @xcite .",
    "spines are composed of a head ( @xmath0 @xmath1 m ) and a thin neck ( @xmath2 @xmath1 m ) attached to the surface of dendrite ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the heads of spines have an active membrane , and as a consequence , they can sustain the propagation of an action potential with a rate that depends on the spatial density of spines @xcite .",
    "decreased spine density can result in cognitive disorders , such as autism , mental retardation and fragile x syndrome @xcite .",
    "diffusion over branched smooth dendritic trees is basically determined by classical diffusion and the mean square displacement ( msd ) along the dendritic axis grows linearly with time .",
    "however , inert particles diffusing along dendrites enter spines and remain there , trapped inside the spine head and then escape through a narrow neck to continue their diffusion along the dendritic axis .",
    "recent experiments together with numerical simulations have shown that the transport of inert particles along spiny dendrites of purkinje and piramidal cells is anomalous with an anomalous exponent that depends on the density of spines @xcite .",
    "based on these results , a fractional nernst - planck equation and fractional cable equation have been proposed for electrodiffusion of ions in spiny dendrites @xcite . whereas many studies have been focused to the coupling between spines and dendrites , they are either phenomenological cable theories @xcite or microscopic models for a single spine and parent dendrite @xcite . more recently a mesoscopic non - markovian model for spines - dendrite interaction and an extension including reactions in spines and variable residence time",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "these models predict anomalous diffusion along the dendrite in agreement with the experiments but are not able to relate how the anomalous exponent depends on the density of spines @xcite . since these experiments have been performed with inert particles ( i.e. , there are not reaction inside spines or dendrites ) we conclude that the observed anomalous diffusion is due exclusively to the geometric structure of the spiny dendrite .",
    "recent studies on the transport of particles inside spiny dendrites indicate the strong relation between the geometrical structure and anomalous transport exponents @xcite",
    ". therefore , elaboration such an analytical model that establishes this relation can be helpful for further understanding transport properties in spiny dendrites .",
    "the real distribution of spines along the dendrite , their size and shapes are completely random @xcite , and inside spines the spine necks act as a transport barrier @xcite .",
    "for these reasons we reasonably assume that the diffusion inside spine is anomalous .",
    "so , we propose in this paper models based on a comb - like structure that mimic a spiny dendrite ; where the backbone is the dendrite and the fingers ( lateral branches ) are the spines .",
    "the models predict anomalous transport inside spiny dendrites , in agreement with the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite , and also explain the dependence between the mean square displacement and the density of spines observed in @xcite .",
    "geometry of the comb structure consisting of a one - dimensional backbone and lateral branches ( fingers ) @xcite makes it possible to describe anomalous diffusion in spiny dendrites structure in the framework of the comb model . in this case",
    "dynamics inside fingers corresponds to spines , while the backbone describes diffusion inside dendrites .",
    "the comb model is an analogue of a 1d medium where fractional diffusion has been observed and explained in the framework of a so - called continuous time random walk @xcite .",
    "usually , anomalous diffusion on the comb is described by the @xmath3 distribution function @xmath4 , and a special behavior is that the displacement in the @xmath5direction is possible only along the structure backbone ( @xmath5-axis at @xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore , diffusion in the @xmath5-direction is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "namely , the diffusion coefficient is @xmath7 , while the diffusion coefficient in the @xmath8direction ( along fingers ) is a constant @xmath9 . due to this geometrical construction ,",
    "the flux of particles along the dendrite is @xmath10 and the flux along the finger describes the anomalous trapping process that occurs inside the spine @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density of particles and @xmath13 is the riemann - liouville fractional derivative , where the fractional integration @xmath14 is defined by means of the laplace transform @xmath15= s^{-\\gamma}\\tilde{f}(s)\\ , .\\ ] ] so , inside the spine , the transport process is anomalous and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 . making use of the continuity equation for the total number of particles @xmath18 where @xmath19 one has the following evolution equation for transport along the spiny dendrite @xmath20 the riemann - liouville fractional derivative in eq .",
    "( [ eb ] ) is not convenient for the laplace transform . to ensure feasibility of the laplace transform , which is a strong machinery for treating fractional equations , one reformulates the problem in a form suitable for the laplace transform application .    to shed light on this situation ,",
    "let us consider a comb in the @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this model is described by the distribution function @xmath22 with evolution equation given by the equation @xmath23it should be stressed that @xmath24 coordinate is a supplementary , virtue variable , introduced to described fractional motion in spines by means of the markovian process .",
    "thus the true distribution is @xmath25 with corresponding evolution equation @xmath26 a relation between @xmath12 and @xmath27 can be expressed through their laplace transforms ( see derivation in the appendix ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 $ ] .",

    "( [ moment2 ] ) predicts subdiffusion along the spiny dendrite which is in agreement with the experimental results reported in @xcite . it should be noted that this result is counterintuitive .",
    "indeed , subdiffusion in spines , or fingers should lead to the slower subdiffusion in dendrites , or backbone with the transport exponent less than in usual comb , since these two processes are strongly correlated .",
    "but this correlation is broken due to the fractional integration @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ 3d_comb5 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we invert ( [ pks ] ) by fourier - laplace we obtain the fractional diffusion equation for @xmath53 @xmath54which is equivalent to the generalized master equation @xmath55if the laplace transform of the memory kernel is given by @xmath56 , which corresponds to the waiting time pdf in the laplace space given by @xmath57 that is @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "the above waiting time pdf is the effective pdf corresponding to the whole comb and takes into account the particle trapping inside spines .",
    "let us employ the notation for a dynamical exponent @xmath60 used in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath61 then the msd grows as @xmath62 . on the other hand , it has been found in experiments that @xmath60 increases with the density of spines @xmath63 and the simulations prove that @xmath60 grows linearly with @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , the experimental data admits almost any growing dependence of @xmath60 with @xmath63 due to the high variance of the data ( see fig 5.d in @xcite ) .",
    "equation ( [ moment2 ] ) also establishes a phenomenological relation between the second moment and @xmath63 .",
    "when the density spines is zero then @xmath64 , @xmath65 and normal diffusion takes place .",
    "if the spine density @xmath63 increases , the anomalous exponent of the pdf ( [ pdf ] ) @xmath66 must decrease ( i.e. , the transport is more subdiffusive due to the increase of @xmath63 ) so that @xmath60 has to increase as well .",
    "so , our model predicts qualitatively that @xmath60 increases with @xmath63 , in agreement with the experimental results in @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider a fractal comb model @xcite to take into account the inhomogeneity of the spines distribution .",
    "the comb model is a phenomenological explanation of an experimental situation , where we introduce a control parameter that establishes a relation between diffusion along dendrites and the density of spines . suggesting more sophisticated relation between the dynamical exponent and the spine density",
    ", we can reasonably suppose that the fractal dimension , due to the box counting of the spine necks , is not integer : it is embedded in the @xmath67 space , thus the spine fractal dimension is @xmath68 . according the fractal geometry ( roughly speaking ) , the most convenient parameter is the fractal dimension of the spine volume ( mass ) @xmath69 .",

    "contrary to the previous analysis expression ( [ msd_a ] ) does not work any more , since superlinear motion is involved in the fractional kinetics .",
    "this leads to divergence of the second moment due to the lvy flights .",
    "the latter are described by the distribution @xmath75 , which is separated from the waiting time probability distribution @xmath76 . to overcome this deficiency",
    ", we follow the analysis of the lvy walks suggested in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider our exact result in eq .",
    "( [ nupks ] ) as an approximation obtained from the joint distribution of the waiting times and the lvy walks .",
    "therefore , a cutoff of the lvy flights is expected at @xmath77 .",
    "this means that a particle moves at a constant velocity inside dendrites not all times , and this laminar motion is interrupted by localization inside spines distributed in space by the power law .",
    "performing the inverse laplace transform , we obtain solution in the form of the mittag - leffler function @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 . for the asymptotic behavior",
    "@xmath80 the argument of the mittag - leffler function can be small .",

    "when @xmath104 and @xmath100 the ffpe ( [ ffpe ] ) corresponds to the continuous comb model , namely spine dendrites with the maximal density of spines . for @xmath104 and @xmath105 this model corresponds to smooth dendrites .",
    "apparently , another physically sound transition to limiting case is possible for @xmath106 and @xmath64 that corresponds first to the transition to the continuous model , and then the transition to @xmath64 .",
