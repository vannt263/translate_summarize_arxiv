    "conventional molecular electronic structure methods such as density functional theory , hartree - fock theory , and coupled cluster theory start with the assumption that a single slater determinant ( sd ) provides a qualitatively good description of the molecule at hand @xcite .",
    "while this assumption is valid for some molecules near equilibrium geometry , the static correlation which arises in other molecules , as well as for geometries far from equilibrium , requires the use of multireference ( mr ) methods .",
    "these provide a qualitative description which is equivalent to multiple sds , thereby resolving the static correlation .",
    "one of these mr methods is the exact diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian in the full hilbert space , also known as full configuration interaction ( fci ) in quantum chemistry ( qc ) . because the many - body hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of single - particle states , only small systems , of up to 18 electrons in 18 orbitals ,",
    "can be treated by fci . in 1999 , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) was introduced in qc @xcite .",
    "this mr method allows to extend the system sizes for which numerically exact solutions can be found to about 40 electrons in 40 orbitals , depending on the nature of the system .",
    "dmrg originated in 1992 in the field of condensed matter @xcite .",
    "although it was originally introduced as a renormalization group flow for increasing many - body hilbert spaces , in 1995 it was realized that dmrg can be reformulated as the variational optimization of a particular wavefunction ansatz , the matrix product state ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "this not only provided the theoretical validation that an energy obtained with dmrg is always an upper bound to the exact eigenvalue , but also shed light on dmrg from a quantum information perspective . non - critical quantum mechanical ground states are believed to obey the so - called area law for the entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "this implies that quantum correlation is local in such a ground state . for one - dimensional systems",
    ", the boundary of a line segment consists of two points , and the entanglement entropy is a constant , independent of system length .",
    "this is the reason why dmrg works extremely well for one - dimensional non - critical systems .",
    "quantum information theory also induced the development of other so - called tensor network states ( tns ) , which capture the entanglement entropy well in higher dimensional and/or critical systems @xcite .",
    "there even exists a continuous mps ansatz for quantum fields @xcite .",
    "although the active orbital space of most molecular systems is far from one - dimensional , dmrg has been very useful for ab initio qc @xcite .",
    "the variational upper bound to the true eigenvalue , obtained with dmrg , can be systematically improved by increasing the so - called bond or virtual dimension of the mps ansatz .",
    "this provides a way to check the convergence of dmrg calculations .    in ab initio qc methods which use fci ,",
    "the fci solver can be replaced by dmrg .",
    "ab initio dmrg allows for an efficient extraction of the reduced two - body density matrix ( 2-rdm ) @xcite .",
    "the 2-rdm of the active space is required in the complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) method to compute the gradient and the hessian .",
    "it is therefore natural to introduce a casscf variant with dmrg as active space solver , dmrg - scf @xcite .",
    "this allows one to describe static correlation in large active spaces .",
    "to add dynamic correlation as well , three dmrg - based methods have been introduced . _",
    "( a ) _ with a little more effort , the 3-rdm and contracted 4-rdms can be extracted from dmrg as well .",
    "these are required to apply second order perturbation theory to a casscf wavefunction , called caspt2 .",
    "the dmrg variant is dmrg - caspt2 @xcite . _",
    "( b ) _ based on a casscf wavefunction , a configuration interaction expansion can be introduced , called mrci .",
    "recently , an approximate dmrg - mrci variant was proposed @xcite . _",
    "( c ) _ yet another way is to perform a canonical transformation ( ct ) on top of an mr wavefunction .",
    "when an mps is used as mr wavefunction , the method is called dmrg - ct @xcite .",
    "in addition to ground states , dmrg can also find excited states . by projecting out lower lying eigenstates , or by targeting a specific energy @xcite",
    ", the dmrg algorithm solves for a particular excited state . in these state - specific algorithms ,",
    "the whole renormalized basis is used to represent one single eigenstate . in state - averaged dmrg ,",
    "several eigenstates are targeted at once .",
    "their rdms are weighted and summed to perform the dmrg renormalization step @xcite .",
    "the renormalized basis then represents several eigenstates at once .",
    "dmrg linear response theory ( dmrg - lrt ) can be used as well to find excited states .",
    "once the ground state has been found , the mps tangent vectors to this optimized point can be used as an ( incomplete ) variational basis to approximate excited states @xcite . as the tangent vectors to an optimized sd yield the configuration interaction with singles ( cis ) , also called the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) , for hartree - fock theory @xcite ,",
    "the same names are used for dmrg : dmrg - cis or dmrg - tda . by linearizing the time - dependent variational principle for matrix product states @xcite , the dmrg random phase approximation ( dmrg - rpa )",
    "is found @xcite , again in complete analogy with rpa for hartree - fock theory .",
    "the variational optimization in an ( incomplete ) basis of mps tangent vectors can be extended to higher - order tangent spaces as well .",
    "dmrg - cisd , or dmrg configuration interaction with singles and doubles , is a variational approximation to target both ground and excited states in the space spanned by the mps reference and its single and double tangent spaces @xcite .    in ab initio qc",
    ", two other tnss have been employed as well : the tree tns @xcite and the complete - graph tns @xcite . while they require a smaller virtual dimension to achieve the same accuracy , their optimization algorithms are less efficient , and as a result an mps is currently still the preferred choice for ab initio qc . in section",

    "<S> the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) has become an indispensable numerical tool to find exact eigenstates of finite - size quantum systems with strong correlation . in the fields of condensed matter , nuclear structure and molecular electronic structure </S>",
    "<S> , it has significantly extended the system sizes that can be handled compared to full configuration interaction , without losing numerical accuracy . for quantum chemistry ( qc ) , </S>",
    "<S> the most efficient implementations of dmrg require the incorporation of particle number , spin and point group symmetries in the underlying matrix product state ( mps ) ansatz , as well as the use of so - called complementary operators . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetries introduce a sparse block structure in the mps ansatz and in the intermediary contracted tensors . </S>",
    "<S> if a symmetry is non - abelian , the wigner - eckart theorem allows to factorize a tensor into a clebsch - gordan coefficient and a reduced tensor . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the fermion signs have to be carefully tracked . </S>",
    "<S> because of these challenges , implementing dmrg efficiently for qc is not straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> efficient and freely available implementations are therefore highly desired . in this work we present chemps2 , our free open - source spin - adapted implementation of dmrg for ab initio qc . around chemps2 </S>",
    "<S> , we have implemented the augmented hessian newton - raphson complete active space self - consistent field method , with exact hessian . </S>",
    "<S> the bond dissociation curves of the 12 lowest states of the carbon dimer were obtained at the dmrg(28 orbitals , 12 electrons , d@xmath0=2500)/cc - pvdz level of theory . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of @xmath1 core correlation to the @xmath2 bond dissociation curve of the carbon dimer was estimated by comparing energies at the dmrg(36o , 12e , d@xmath3=2500)/cc - pcvdz and dmrg - scf(34o , 8e , d@xmath3=2500)/cc - pcvdz levels of theory .    </S>",

    "<S> + _ restrictions : _ </S>",
    "<S> + our implementation of the density matrix renormalization group is spin - adapted . </S>",
    "<S> this means that targeted eigenstates in the active space are exact eigenstates of the total electronic spin operator . </S>",
    "<S> hamiltonians which break this symmetry ( a magnetic field term for example ) can not be handled by our code . </S>",
    "<S> as electron repulsion integrals in gaussian basis sets have eightfold permutation symmetry , we have used this property in our code . </S>",
    "<S> + _ unusual features : _ + the nature of the matrix product state ansatz allows for exact spin coupling . in chemps2 , the _ total _ electronic spin is imposed ( not just the spin projection ) , in addition to the particle - number and abelian point - group symmetries . + _ running time : _ + the running time depends on the size of the targeted active space , the number of desired eigenstates , their symmetry , the density of states , the individual orbital symmetries , the orbital ordering , the desired level of convergence , and the chosen convergence scheme . to converge a single point of one of the dissociation curves of the carbon dimer ( @xmath4 symmetry ) in the cc - pvdz basis ( 28 orbitals ; their ordering is described in section [ secirreporder ] ) with 2500 reduced renormalized basis states ( see the convergence scheme in section [ howtoextrapolateenergies ] ; the variational energy then lies 0.1 @xmath5 above the fully converged result ) takes about 8 hours on a single node with a dual - socket octa - core intel xeon sandy bridge ( e5 - 2670 ) ( 16 cores at 2.6 ghz ) , and requires 6 gb of ram . </S>"
