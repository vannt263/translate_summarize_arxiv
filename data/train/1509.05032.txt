    "fault - tolerant quantum computation provides a means to process quantum information with faulty devices using quantum error - correcting codes together with logical gate constructions that do not propagate errors , in such a way that a quantum computation of arbitrary length can occur provided the error rate is below a threshold  @xcite . for two decades now , the focus for research into quantum architectures has been to increase this error threshold as high as possible .",
    "the high - threshold schemes of knill  @xcite and raussendorf , harrington , and goyal  @xcite have error thresholds of around @xmath2 , and there has not been significant improvement in these threshold values in the subsequent decade of research .",
    "unfortunately , these high - threshold schemes possess dauntingly large overheads , that is , a significant excess in the number of physical qubits and gates necessary to construct the fault - tolerant logical operations .",
    "for example , the high - threshold scheme for quantum computation based on surface codes  @xcite has an overhead that increases with problem size , but typical numbers are of the order of @xmath3 or more physical qubits per logical qubit when magic state distillation is included  @xcite .",
    "there is considerable motivation , then , for the design of fault tolerant schemes with low overhead  @xcite .    in this paper , we explore a method for reducing this overhead in systems where the noise is biased , specifically , where dephasing ( the @xmath1 error rate ) is dominant over other errors .",
    "our results are motivated by previous studies of architectures with high error threshold in such a noise bias regime  @xcite .",
    "although the increase in the error threshold in these noise - biased architectures is relatively modest compared with standard constructions , we demonstrate that the overhead can be reduced by approximately a factor of four across a wide range of noise regimes .",
    "one of the most significant contributions to the large overhead in existing fault - tolerant quantum computing schemes is the distillation of high - fidelity magic states that enable a universal logic gate set using only clifford operations , and several investigations have explored how to reduce this particular cost  @xcite .",
    "building on these previous results , we propose and analyse a simple fault - tolerant gadget capable of directly preparing encoded magic states in a system affected by biased noise .",
    "this gadget has significant error correction capabilities for @xmath1 errors , but ignores all other errors .",
    "we derive expressions for the logical error rates on the encoded magic state preparation in terms of the circuit parameters , and demonstrate that for bare error rates of less than @xmath4 and biases of at least @xmath5 , the logical error rate of the encoded magic state is lower than the bare error rate .",
    "the simplicity of this gadget should result in reduced overheads when used in a larger fault - tolerant construction .    to quantify these gains , we consider the overhead involved in using these magic states to prepare high - fidelity magic states in a quantum reed - muller code , and compare with standard distillation methods . here , we find that for biases of at least a factor of 10 , the overhead for @xmath0-type magic state distillation using the scheme at the physical level followed by concatenated layers of the 15-qubit quantum reed - muller distillation is almost always lower than using the quantum reed - muller distillation directly , for a broad range of physical and target error rates .",
    "our comparison uses only non - clifford gate count , and so ignores the fact that our gadget offers a reduction in clifford gate overhead as well .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we introduce the noise model , quantum codes , and gate set for biased noise in section  [ sec : codes ] . in section  [ sec : magicprep ] , we present the circuit for fault - tolerant production of magic states , and detail its operation .",
    "section  [ sec : errors ] presents an analysis of how errors can arise and propagate through the circuit , including a calculation of the logical noise rate affecting the output encoded state .",
    "section  [ sec : distill ] provides an illustration of how this gadget could be used within a larger fault - tolerant scheme with lower overhead , by considering the specific case of encoding the output state into a reed - muller code for further distillation using standard techniques .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] presents some concluding remarks .",
    "a standard noise model for studying quantum error correcting codes and fault - tolerant circuits is for single - qubit @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath1 errors to occur with equal probability , i.e. , a uniform single - qubit depolarization channel , independently on all qubits . while this noise model has a theoretical simplicity , it is not representative of the observed noise on many physical manifestations of a qubit . in particular , for qubits defined by nondegenerate energy levels with hamiltonian proportional to @xmath1 , the noise model is generically described by a dephasing ( @xmath1-error ) rate that is distinct from the rates for relaxation and other non - energy - preserving errors .",
    "examples include trapped ions  @xcite , superconducting qubits  @xcite , and electron spins in semiconductors  @xcite . for these qubits , the observed @xmath1-error rate can be substantially larger than all other error rates .",
    "we consider a phenomenological noise model that includes both independent single qubit errors occurring at any location in the circuit ( preparations , gates , measurements , and waiting times ) as well as correlated two - qubit errors occurring at two - qubit gates . unlike in standard noise models ,",
    "our single qubit errors are described by independent pauli @xmath1 and @xmath6 errors occurring at different rates .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the probability of @xmath1 and @xmath6 errors , respectively , resulting from the noise on a gate , or during a state preparation or measurement .",
    "we assume @xmath10 , that is , that @xmath6 errors occur with a lower frequency than @xmath1 errors , and define the _ bias _ to be @xmath11 . as an example , for a qubit encoded in a pair of electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite , dephasing dominates over relaxation processes resulting in a noise bias of at least @xmath12 .    for the correlated errors , because we will make use of an entangling gate that is diagonal in the @xmath1 basis , assume that only correlated @xmath1 errors occur on both qubits in a two qubit gate with rate @xmath13 .",

    "it is natural to select a quantum error correcting code that offers better properties ( specifically , distance ) for @xmath1 errors than other errors .",

    "as we will show , the action of @xmath47 can be viewed as providing a rotation on the logical state of block 2 conditional on the logical state of block 1 , with the addition of systematic correlated @xmath6 `` errors '' on both blocks as well as correctable @xmath1 errors that map out of the codespace .",
    "both of these effects can be corrected by the gadget .",
    "the measurement of @xmath38 on the first block will reveal the parity of the number of such correlated @xmath6 errors , thus collapsing the state on one of two possibilities @xmath55 the measurement of @xmath38 on the first block can be performed as in fig .",

    "a logical @xmath37 error occurs if an @xmath6 error affects any of the qubits in the output block .",
    "working backwards through the steps in the gadget , we see that an @xmath6 error on block 3 occurs in only two ways : either an @xmath6 error occurs on one of the qubits in block 3 ( with total probability @xmath89 ) , or the measurement @xmath90 used in the error correction gadget is faulty ( with probability @xmath91 )",

    "we return to the best choice of @xmath106 in the next section .",
    "logical @xmath38 errors occur if the error correction gadget fails .",
    "the first such failure mode is when a @xmath1 error occurs on all @xmath15 qubits in either blocks 1 or 2 ; the result is a logical error that can not be detected by the error correction gadget . on block 1 ,",
    "@xmath1 errors can occur during preparation , measurement , the @xmath31 gates , or any of @xmath56 cphase gates .",
    "the same holds for block 2 , but with @xmath95 cphase gates instead of @xmath56 . additionally , a single @xmath6 error on an ancilla for the measurements @xmath36 and @xmath90 could cause @xmath38 errors on block 1 and block 2 , respectively",
    ". such an error can happen on each qubit in any of @xmath56 repetitions @xmath15 cphase gates for @xmath36 or any of @xmath95 repetitions of @xmath97 cphase gates for @xmath90 .",
    "the probability @xmath111 of any of the above possibilities occurring is upper bounded by @xmath112    a second source of logical @xmath38 errors is the possibility of preparing the incorrect magic state @xmath113 as a result of a faulty @xmath6 measurement .",
    "( note that such failures are distinct from cases where the @xmath6 measurement results are correct , but correspond to a different angle than the one desired ; in such cases the output can be discarded . ) we simplify the calculation by treating any such incorrect angle as a logical @xmath38 error .",
    "because the @xmath6 measurements on block 2 are compared with the @xmath6 measurements on block 1 , all such fault channels will be detected unless correlated @xmath1 errors occur on both qubits in a pair on blocks 1 and 2 .",
    "when such a pair of errors occurs on blocks 1 and 2 , the resulting state is different from the desired @xmath113 state .",
    "such a process could happen either as a correlated error in the @xmath47 gate or as a pair of independent @xmath1 errors on a pair of qubits .",
    "( note that this is the sole error process where the repetition code does not directly protect against @xmath1 errors . ) while correlated errors can occur only at a @xmath31 gate , independent @xmath1 errors on pairs of qubits can occur during preparation , any of the operations , or at measurement .",
    "this yields an upper bound of @xmath114 thus , again making the assumption that @xmath115 , we obtain a bound on the total logical @xmath38 error rate for the circuit : @xmath116    as with the logical @xmath37 error rate , the effect of repeated measurement @xmath106 is to exponentially suppress the effect of @xmath1 errors in the first term at the expense of increasing the effect of @xmath6 errors linearly with @xmath106 .",

    "as an example , for a bare @xmath1 error rate of @xmath4 and bare noise bias of @xmath128 , choosing @xmath129 yields a final noise bias of approximately @xmath130 , meaning that the logical noise is very strongly dominated by @xmath1 errors . by contrast , choosing @xmath131 , with the other parameters the same as above , gives an output bias of 0.8 , indicating that the final logical @xmath1 and @xmath6 error rates have become comparable .",

    ". clearly , using the noise - bias gadget will be superior if , for a given target logical error rate , we require @xmath134 , i.e. , that the noise - bias gadget at the physical level eliminates the need for at least one layer of concatenation , compared to without the noise - bias gadget .    in fig .",

    "for comparison , the overhead for @xmath140 ( no noise biased encoding ) with the same target error rate is shown.,title=\"fig : \" ]    although we have used the number of non - clifford gates as our measure of ` overhead ' , a more informative measure would be to use the total number of operations including cliffords .",
    "we can estimate the overheads by this measure as well .",
    "the standard rm distillation scheme uses 139 operations  @xcite , whereas the @xmath85 noise - bias gadget uses 41 on average , a savings of a factor of approximately @xmath141 .",
    "this savings in overhead is comparable to counting non - clifford gates : the standard quantum rm scheme uses 15 non - cliffords and ours uses @xmath124 on average , a savings of a factor of @xmath142 .",
    "note also that our method of assessment is unfavorable for the noise - biased scheme , because we account for gate errors in the noise - bias gadget but not in the distillation using the quantum rm code .",
    "for instance , if we compare the use of the noise - bias gadget concatenated with a single quantum rm code with two layers of concatenation of the quantum rm code , then in the former case clifford errors of the first encoding layer are taken into account while in the latter both layers are assumed to be error - free .",
    "for this reason , the actual savings offered by our scheme will be larger .",
    "we have demonstrated that a method for encoded magic state preparation that operates when the noise is biased can offer a reduction in overhead compared with standard schemes .",
    "the precise gains will depend on the details of the architecture , and in particular the amount of noise and bias at the physical level as well as the desired target logical error rate .",
    "we briefly consider two regimes of target logical error rate .",
    "first , consider the regime of high noise and a relaxed target of @xmath135 , which might be relevant for quantum chemistry calculations or ` initial ' applications of quantum processors . in this regime ,",
    "our approach provides a reduction in overhead by at least a factor of @xmath143 ( we use our scheme plus one round of rm distillation , as opposed to needing 2 rounds of rm distillation without ) for error rates @xmath144 provided the bias is greater than @xmath145 .",
    "second , consider a more demanding target of say @xmath139 , as may be required for large - scale quantum computing .",
    "the noise - bias approach provides a similar improvement in overhead and circuit complexity in the ` reasonable ' noise regime @xmath146 for biases greater than @xmath145 , requiring two concatenated quantum rm code layers rather than three .",
    "our encoded magic - state gadget is explicitly based on the use of a phase - flip repetition code defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : repcode ] ) , which offers protection against @xmath1 errors but none against @xmath6 errors . it would be worthwhile to consider if our results can be generalized to other stabilizer codes that have differing minimum distance for @xmath6 and @xmath1 errors .",
