    "supernovae are bright stellar explosions which can now be observed up to redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "several programmes ( perlmutter et al . 1997 , 1998 ; schmidt et al . 1997 ; garnavich et al .",
    "1997 ) are presently devoted to discover high  redshift supernovae for cosmological purposes .",
    "the goal is to determine the geometry of the universe through the effect that @xmath13 , @xmath2 have in the magnitude ",
    "redshift relationship of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "the same programmes provide rates of explosion up to large redshifts through proper evaluation of control time and efficiency of detection .",
    "indeed , the supernova cosmology project has already achieved the first results after evaluating the data collected in its 1995 and 1996 discovery runs ( pain et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "in this @xmath14 we outline the theoretical background for the prediction of those number counts for different geometries of the universe and for various sne ia progenitors .",
    "the pace at which stars formed in the past ( the sfr ) and the evolutionary clock to explosion of those binary supernovae is reflected in the counts .",
    "the evolutionary clock spans , in the case of sne ia as opposed to sne ii , an important fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "sne ia counts extending up to apparent red magnitudes @xmath15 could provide a good test of the sne ia binary progenitor systems .",
    "we also find that sne ia counts should be sensitive to a @xmath1dominancy in our universe through a larger increase at @xmath3 .",
    "refinements in the determination of the global sfr and continued sne ia searches at large redshifts should furnish , in the near future , an accurate enough basis for both tests .",
    "the global sfr recently derived for high redshift galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) by madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) has been extended to lower redshifts ( madau 1997 ) in accordance with the results of lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "the variation of the sfr with @xmath16 is similar to that of the space density of quasars ( shaver et al .",
    "1996 ) , peaking at @xmath17 , the latter showing , however , a steeper slope both prior and after maximum .",
    "the above @xmath18 at @xmath19 has been obtained from the uv luminosity density along redshift .",
    "robinson et al . (",
    "1997 ) have also derived a @xmath18 from iso infrared observations of galaxies in the hdf .",
    "the general shape agrees well with madau s ( 1996 ) data but the inferred values are higher , maybe implying that about 2/3 of star formation at high @xmath16 has taken place shrouded by dust . in a different approach , pei & fall ( 1995 ) have dealt with the determination of the global star formation history by tracking the evolution of the global hi contents of the universe as measured from @xmath20 qso absorption  line systems .",
    "the results of madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) agree with those from that very different approach . on the other hand , lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) provide , from the canada  france ",
    "hawaii redshift survey , an estimate of the comoving luminosity density of the universe over the redshift range @xmath21 , which can be interpreted in terms of a @xmath18 which agrees with previous estimates of a significant increase with @xmath16 up to @xmath22 .",
    "prospects to further explore the global sfr include the number counts of sne ii discovered at high redshift , which should trace the activity of star formation in the universe along @xmath16 .",
    "such numbers on sn ii are obtainable in current high@xmath16 sne searches . given the continuous improvement in the determination of the global sfr , we base the present calculation of sne ia number counts on the most recent empirical results .",
    "we evaluate the rate of explosion of sne ia by convolving their time to explosion with the sfr .",
    "the rate can then be calculated as :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the sne ia rate after an instantaneous outburst , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are in the sn rest frame . depending on the progenitor systems , in some cases we would have sne ia with a peak rate of explosion at 10@xmath27 yr . in other cases , there can be some sne ia exploding even only a few @xmath28 yr after star formation already , thus becoming the brightest optical events at @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is derived from the global @xmath18 ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ; madau 1997 ) .",
    "the adopted @xmath18 ( for @xmath31 , @xmath6 , @xmath2 = 0 ) is shown in the top panel of figure 1 , along with the measured data points and their error bars .",
    "note that the data points from connolly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the @xmath32 range fall somewhat below whereas those from rowan ",
    "robinson et al . ( 1997 ) for the @xmath33 range are significantly above the adopted curve .",
    "the @xmath18 is transformed according to the geometries of the model universes considered . here",
    "we restrict this presentation to three favored models of the universe : _ model a _ , a flat universe with @xmath34 , @xmath4 , @xmath35 ; _ model b _ , an open universe with @xmath5 , @xmath9 , @xmath35 , and _ model c _ , a flat universe with @xmath36 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath18 derived for each case is next transformed into @xmath37 ( in the comoving frame ) .",
    "the derived global @xmath37 , when time  integrated over the whole history of the corresponding universe ( model @xmath38 : @xmath39 ; model @xmath40 : @xmath41 ; model @xmath42 : @xmath43 ) , produces the observed stars today ( guzmn et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the global sne ia rates , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , for each model universe and family of sne ia progenitor systems , are calculated in the comoving frame according to ( 1 ) , and integrated over comoving volume to obtain the expected sne ia counts ( @xmath46 ) as a function of z. we integrate over @xmath47 :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the proper motion distance and @xmath50 is the fractional contribution of the curvature to the expansion ( carroll , press , & turner 1992 ) .",
    "@xmath49 is related to the luminosity distance @xmath51 through @xmath52 ( weinberg 1972 ) .",

    "the dependence on cosmological parameters of the comoving volume derivative @xmath62 differs from one model of universe to another .",
    "a different cosmological effect is the age ",
    "redshift ( t(z ) ) relationship for different model universes , which changes the z at which the sne ia rates peak .",
    "the results are tightly linked to the reliability of the global sfr .",
    "an estimate of its current uncertainty can be obtained by looking at the data points in the top panel of figure 1 .",
    "increasingly accurate sfrs should steadily improve the sne ia rate predictions .",
    "there is , as well , increasing evidence of universality in the slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) from tests in different metallicity and age environments .",
    "such a `` universal '' mass function would be well represented by the salpeter ( 1955 ) power law with @xmath63 .",
    "both the overall trend to convergence in the estimate of the global @xmath18 and the almost constancy of the imf favor the possibility of deriving global values for the sne ia explosion rates .",
    "_ stellar clock : binary progenitors_. all evolutionary models for sne ia progenitors involve the accretion of mass by a c+o wd from a companion in a close binary system .",
    "current research on sne ia has discarded some formerly proposed sne ia scenarios .",
    "the two classes of binary systems considered here as the most likely systems giving sne ia are : ( 1 ) the merging of two white dwarfs also called double degenerate scenario ( dd) , and ( 2 ) the accretion by the wd of h from a less evolved star in a close binary system a single degenerate scenario ( sd). we call this second case a cataclysmic  like system ( cls )",
    ". the time evolution of the sne ia rates after star formation differs from one family of progenitor systems to another , and there are variations within each family .",
    "we have modeled the sne ia rates by means of the same monte carlo code as in previous works ( ruiz  lapuente , burkert , & canal 1995,1997 ; canal , ruiz  lapuente , & burkert 1996 , hereafter rcb95,97 and crb96 ) , and adopting different prescriptions for each evolutionary path and for the initial binary parameters .",
    "we have also compared our predictions with those of other authors : ( 1 ) the physical input for the merging of two c+o white dwarfs ( wds ) is modeled both as in iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) and in rbc95 .",
    "we allow for a number of different physical descriptions of the binary evolution , and we try different values of the common envelope parameter @xmath64 ( a measure of the efficiency with which orbital energy is used in envelope ejection ) .",
    "( 2 ) the physical modeling of the explosion of a c+o wd when it reaches the chandrasekhar mass by accretion and burning of h from a main  sequence , subgiant , or giant companion is modeled as in the early work by iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) , as in crb96 , and finally including the most recently proposed variation of the binary evolution by hachisu , kato , & nomoto ( 1996 ) , who find a `` wind '' solution for fast hydrogen accretion by a wd from a red(sub)giant companion , but we apply the same evolutionary constraints as yungelson et al .",
    "particularly relevant to the modeling are the slope of the imf , the distribution of mass ratios @xmath65 of the secondary to the primary , and the distribution of initial separations @xmath66 in the progenitor binary sytems , together with the prescriptions for mass transfer . by trying various physical approaches adopted by different modelers and exploring different values of the initial binary parameters ( imf , @xmath65 , @xmath66 distributions ) and assumptions as to the mass transfer rates",
    ", we obtain the characteristic behaviour of each stellar clock and the uncertainties in the absolute scale of the rates .    in figure 1 , a comparison of @xmath24 in ( 1 ) with those from other authors ( middle panels : different imf , @xmath65 and @xmath66 distributions ; bottom panel : different assumptions as to the allowed mass transfer rates ) is made . from such comparison",
    "we concluded in our previous work that the evolution of the sne ia rates ( rise , peak , decline ) along cosmic time , for a given class of systems , have broad common features shared by the predictions from different authors ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; tutukov & yungelson 1994 ; yungelson et al .",
    "1996 ; our own modeling ) , which basically describe the clock of the corresponding systems .",
    "the hachisu , kato & nomoto ( 1996 ) solution , here called cls(w ) , would allow to have some relatively young sne ia in the cls scenario , and the sne ia rate would increase fast with redshift . on the other hand , the dd scenario predicts a flatter increase of the rate from z @xmath67 0 to z@xmath67 1 , in all model universes .",
    "in all cases , the @xmath24 shown here would give , for our own galaxy and the present time , sne ia rates which are within the current error bars of the observational estimates .",
    "versions cls and cls(w ) in the bottom panel of figure 1 illustrate the range of uncertainty in the time of start of the explosions in the sd scenarios . for the dd progenitors we have chosen the most favorable physical assumptions , those that enhance the numbers of sne ia at high @xmath16 , in order to best reproduce the first observational results .",
    "any other choices would give lower numbers .",
    "in fact , the observed numbers seem to be above the predictions for this type of binary progenitor system ( but one should stress here the uncertainty in the global sfr ) .",
    "a clear feature of the dd scenario is not only that the sne ia rates do not increase fast towards higher redshifts but also that they are lower than those predicted for the sd progenitors .",
    "we should note here that we are assuming the universality of the distributions of binary parameters determined for the solar neighbourhood ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) .",
    "we have explored , however , the effects that plausible changes in the initial @xmath65 and @xmath66 distributions would have in the outcome and found them to be only moderate ( see below ) .",
    "_ counts as a function of magnitude_. we compare the model counts with the observations by deriving the dependence of the number counts on @xmath68 , the apparent magnitude of the sne ia in the @xmath69 photometric band .",
    "in fact , in this transformation the intrinsic dispersion in brightness of the sne ia is not a key factor , since we are using the @xmath70 relationship measured in intervals of 0.2 to 0.5 mag for our tests ( we could also use @xmath71 , thus avoiding the transformation to magnitude ) .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion in magnitude is , in contrast , very important for cosmological tests using @xmath72 .",
    "we assume the sne ia to have an average absolute blue magnitude :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 ( perlmutter et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the distance modulus for each @xmath16 is calculated from the luminosity distance @xmath51 .",
    "the apparent @xmath68 at maximum as a function of @xmath16 is determined from :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is taken from kim , goobar , & perlmutter ( 1996 ) ( it includes the full transformation from @xmath40 into @xmath69 magnitudes ) .",
    "we finally calculate the variation of the sne ia rate ( @xmath77 @xmath78 ) with apparent red magnitude @xmath68 ( we take @xmath79 ) .",
    "the results are displayed in the four panels of figure 2 . shown in the figure",
    "are the data points currently available ( pain et al . 1996 ; pain , private communication ) .",
    "the dips in the curves are entirely due to the shape of the @xmath80corrections .",
    "the different slopes of the curves from one family of progenitors to another mainly reflect how fast the sne ia rate declines after reaching its peak value plus the time elapsed between star formation and the peak ( steeper decline and longer time delay for the cls and cls(w ) models than for the dd model : see the middle and bottom panels of figure 1 ) , and the absolute values of the rates at low redshift ( @xmath81 ) are sensitive to the ages of the corresponding model universes ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the slopes of the rates when comparing different models of the universe are sensitive to the contribution of a non ",
    "zero @xmath1 .",
    "the faster increase of the rates with magnitude ( redshift ) along the model sequence a ",
    "c corresponds to the increasing comoving volume derivatives ( @xmath62 ) in the respective model universes .",
    "such derivative is large if @xmath2 gives a significant contribution to @xmath83 . as a check of the sensitivity of the results to the choices of the binary model parameters",
    ", we have also calculated the @xmath84@xmath68 relationship , for the dd progenitor , adopting different @xmath65 and @xmath66 distributions ( dotted line in the middle panel of figure 1 ) : the final curve is not very sensitive to the various choices of the distributions explored in this work ( the model is shown by the continuous line in the four panels of figure 2 ) .",
    "taking at their face values the sfr and parameters for the sne ia progenitor evolution adopted , and also the two data points , the results for both the cls and cls(w ) systems give better fits to the data than those for the dd systems , model universe a being most favored and model c giving the worst fit for any kind of system .",
    "but those conclusions are preliminary and we must await the reduction of the uncertainties in the observed counts and in the global sfr for the intermediate  mass stars leading to sne ia . as we see from figure 2 ,",
    "at present the uncertainty in the sne ia counts at @xmath85 is of the order of a factor of 2 .",
    "that is the same as the difference between the prediction for the dd model and the lowest one for the sd model , and also similar to the range covered by the two extreme predictions ( cls and cls(w ) ) for the sd model .",
    "any increase in the sfr would almost homologously shift upwards all the count predictions . at higher magnitudes ,",
    "the range of predictions for the sd models becomes narrower while the differences with the dd model increase .",
    "thus , if we knew both the sne ia counts at @xmath86 and the global sfr to better than a factor 1.5 , we could already discriminate between the sd and the dd models .",
    "the sensitivity to the cosmological parameters @xmath13 and @xmath2 is still low at those magnitudes .",
    "if we had determined , for instance , the dd model to be the right one , then the sne ia counts at @xmath87 ( corresponding to @xmath88 ) in the c universe ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) should be twice those in the a universe ( @xmath4 , @xmath89 ) , the factor of increase from @xmath90 to @xmath87 being also twice as large in case c as compared with case a ( both contrasts would be sharper if the sd model were the right one ) .",
    "the high@xmath16 sn searches to measure @xmath13 , @xmath2 from the variation of the apparent magnitudes of sne ia are now almost reaching @xmath91 ( perlmutter et al . 1998 ; garnavich et al . 1997 ) . from samples large enough to derive the sne ia counts at @xmath88",
    ", the constraints on both parameters should be tighter than those obtainable from the counts alone , but the latter could provide a supplementary test , since it is based on a different approach : the use of a volume effect instead of a redshift  magnitude effect .",
    "counts extending to even higher magnitudes would more clearly reveal the geometry of the universe . suggested sn searches up to infrared magnitudes @xmath92 ( miralda  escud & rees 1997 ) would extend well beyond that point .",
    "the theoretical results presented here are intended to show the potential of the comparison between model predictions and the results of undergoing and future sne ia searches .",
    "the slopes of the @xmath84@xmath68 curves are mainly sensitive to the general characteristics of each sne ia model while the absolute values depend more on model parameters and on the sfr .",
    "hence the interest of data covering a broader @xmath68 ( or @xmath16 ) range than those currently available . on the other hand",
    ", the differences in the predictions from any sne ia progenitor assumed , for @xmath2dominated universes as compared with matter  dominated and open universes , become significant at large enough values of @xmath68 . in a universe dominated by @xmath2",
    "the number counts of sne ia show a larger increase at @xmath93 due to the large volume encompassed at that redshift .",
    "useful information would be obtained by the measurement of the evolution of the sne ia counts up to @xmath91 and beyond ( possibly in the k ",
    "band for higher redshifts ) .",
    "the first data obtained by pain et al .",
    "( 1996 ) gave a value of @xmath94 sne ia @xmath95 in a magnitude range of 21.3 @xmath96 r @xmath96 22.3 .",
    "these first results were obtained from three sne discovered at redshifts 0.374 , 0.420 , and 0.354 ( sn 1994h , sn 1994al & sn 1994f ) and the small number statistics dominates this very first measurement . a larger bulk of data , already obtained , will now reduce the statistical uncertainties , and prospects to extend the observations up to higher @xmath16 are on the way .",
    "it is thus too soon to extract firm conclusions from the data .",
    "our purpose here is to propose a new useful test to be completed in the near future .",
