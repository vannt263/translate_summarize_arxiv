    "until the detection of an azimuthal color gradient across one of the arms of the sac galaxy m  99 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gg96 hereafter ) , only sparse evidence of star formation triggered by spiral density waves had been found in stellar counts in the milky way@xcite and m  31@xcite .",
    "more recently , applying the same method defined by gg96 and described below , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mg09 hereafter ) examined a sample of 13 spiral galaxies of types a and ab , and found color gradients consistent with theoretical expectations in 10 of their objects .",
    "although they did not compute stellar orbits , both gg96 and mg09 implicitly assumed that all stars , including those recently born near spiral arms , move in circular orbits .",
    "mg09 did investigate the effects of variable circular speeds and variable densities on observed color gradients and found them to be negligible .",
    "however , complicated non - circular motions have been reported in studies about the migration of young stars following star formation triggered by spiral shocks @xcite .",
    "@xcite had also noticed that the ballistic orbits calculated from galactic hii region complexes follow non - circular trajectories that initially move along ( and not across ) the spiral arms .    in the present work ,",
    "we examine how the presence of non - circular motions would modify the pattern speeds derived from color gradients under the assumption of circular orbits .",
    "we will explore two different approaches .",
    "the first one ( see   [ appr1 ] ) involves the semi - anaylitical solutions obtained for spiral shocks @xcite ; we assume that newly born stars preserve the orbital motion of the shocked gas where they form .",
    "the second approach ( see   [ appr2 ] ) is based on data from mhd simulations ; we follow the gas flow vectors near spiral arms .",
    "we always assume that stars are triggered all along the studied regions of spiral arms in the respective model .",
    "other methods , not discussed here , may involve orbit calculations for young stellar groups .",
    "the photometric technique employed by gg96 and mg09 uses three optical bands , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , plus the near infrared @xmath4 band ( see table [ tbl - filters ] ) . with these filters ,",
    "the reddening insensitive and star - formation sensitive photometric index @xmath5 is obtained :    @xmath6    @xmath7    in star - forming regions , the @xmath8 index has higher values , because the _ g _ and _ j _ bands in the numerator of equation [ eqqlog ] trace the light from red and blue supergiants , respectively .",
    "when the star - formation activity is poor , the value of the @xmath8 goes down .",
    "@xmath1 _ & 5000 & 830 + _ @xmath2 _ & 6800 & 1330 + _ @xmath3 _ & 7800 & 1420 + _ @xmath4 _ & 1.25 & 0.29 +    for each studied galaxy and at each wavelength , the spiral arms are first unwrapped @xcite , by plotting them in a @xmath9 versus @xmath10 map ( see figures [ spiral ] , [ unwra ] ) .",
    "all the spiral arms in the disk galaxy are inspected , in search of color gradients .",
    "if a candidate region is found , the arm is straightened , by adding a different phase - shift to @xmath10 at each value of @xmath9 , until the arm appears as a horizontal line ( see figure [ strai ] ) .",
    "this procedure allows us to add the data from different @xmath9 , and thus to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the light profile as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "1-d plots of @xmath5 vs.  @xmath10 are obtained from the unwrapped and straightened galaxy images .",
    "these are then compared to 1-d plots of @xmath11 , that trace the dust lane location , and to 1-d plots of the @xmath12-band ( or @xmath13 or @xmath14 , depending on what we have available ) data , that trace the density wave ( under the assumption that the near - ir emission of red supergiants can be neglected ) .",
    "the regions that seem to match theoretical expectations according to these plots are selected and compared to stellar population synthesis models , that provide @xmath5 as a function of stellar age , @xmath15 .",
    "if one assumes that stars form in the site of the shock , and that they age as they move away from this location , then distance from the dust lane ( at constant radius ) parametrizes stellar age .",
    "in fact , stretching the model @xmath16 to fit the data ( where @xmath5 is a function of angular or linear distance ) fixes the ratio between the distance from the shock , @xmath17 , and the age of the stellar population .",
    "if , in addition , the rotational velocity is known , it is possible to find the angular velocity of the spiral pattern , @xmath18 , as follows :    @xmath19    here , @xmath20 is the mean radius of the region where the gradient has been detected , measured from the center of the galaxy ; @xmath21 is the rotational velocity of the disk at such radius ( obtained from the literature ) ; @xmath17 is distance from the shock , and @xmath15 is the stellar age obtained from fitting the population synthesis model to the observations . with the pattern speed , we obtain the location of major resonances : the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) , corotation , and the 4/1 resonance .",
    "this resonance positions are compared with the observed spiral end points .    as mentioned before",
    ", this procedure implicitly assumes circular motion for the stars involved , even though no stellar orbits have been computed .",
    "shock solutions obtained from semi - analytical approaches have shown that gas streamlines are not circular .",
    "@xcite , for example , found that streamlines appear as sharp - pointed ovals ( see figure  [ sharp ] ) .",
    "although such solutions were found for the tightly wound approximation , they provide a good reference for the study of real galaxies  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ", we obtain gas streamlines under the assumption that young stars follow the motion of the molecular gas , and by adopting a procedure similar to that of @xcite .. the reference system is the rotating frame of the spiral pattern . ] our adopted model has a pattern speed of 13 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 , and a flat rotation curve with @xmath23 km s@xmath22 . from @xmath24 kpc to @xmath25 kpc",
    ", streamlines were calculated in steps of 0.05 kpc .",
    "since the stellar models give us @xmath5 as a function of @xmath26 , we can assign a stellar age to each point in the streamlines ; in order to do so , we need to assume that the onset of star formation occurs at a certain orbital time @xmath27 , where @xmath28 corresponds to the shock position .",
    "@xcite use the term ",
    "timescale for star formation \" as the duration of the burst , that is estimated to be @xmath29 years .",
    "they do not make any assumptions about the time it takes for star formation to begin after the shock .",
    "a preliminary inspection of their findings shows that the shock ( as traced by the dust lanes ) and the onset of star formation ( marked by @xmath30 in the stellar models ) are not always at the same location . in real galaxies , whether there is a delay between the shock and the star formation onset is not well understood yet .",
    "in fact , the time needed for a diffuse cloud of neutral gas to first become a dense cloud , then a molecular cloud , and finally a self - gravitating cloud is @xmath31 years .",
    "once this cloud is formed , the onset of star formation may be very fast @xcite .",
    "@xcite , based on an observational study between the peaks of molecular ( @xmath32 ) and young stellar ( @xmath33 ) arms , report a delay for the onset of star formation of @xmath34 myr in 5 galaxies ( out of 13 ) ; @xcite estimate a timescale for star formation in the range 1 - 4 myr , from a study of angular offsets between hi and 24@xmath35 emissivity peaks in a sample of 14 disk galaxies .",
    "in order to test for the effects of a star formation onset delay on azimuthal color gradients , we try three cases . the first one has a delay ( i.e. , the time it takes for the gas to move from the shock to the location where star formation begins ) @xmath36 yr ; the other two have @xmath37 yr and @xmath38 yr , respectively .",
    "the gas simulations were performed with a version of the zeus code @xcite , that is an eulerian , time - explicit , finite - difference code for ideal mhd simulations .",
    "we employ a 2d grid with 500 @xmath39 500 points in polar coordinates .",
    "the radial extent goes from @xmath40 3 to 30 kpc , and the azimuthal one from @xmath41 to @xmath42 radians .",
    "we assume that the half disk simulation data have a @xmath43 `` mirror '' symmetry .",
    "the gaseous disk follows an isothermal equation of state with a temperature of 10900@xmath44 k. at the beginning of the simulation , the magnetic field has a toroidal geometry and a value of @xmath45 g at @xmath46kpc from the galactic center , although it rapidly evolves away from this setup .",
    "no self - gravity is included .",
    "the background gravitational potential has two components : one axisymmetric , that consists of a bulge , a disk , and a halo , while the other is the non - axisymmetric spiral arm perturbation .",
    "the adopted bulge and disk are described in @xcite .",
    "the dark matter halo is nfw type @xcite , with density :    @xmath47    where @xmath48=@xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51=15.133 kpc .",
    "the two - arm spiral potential has a pitch angle of @xmath52 , and is self - consistent in the stellar orbits sense @xcite .",
    "the simulation is performed in this stellar arms reference frame , that rotates with velocity @xmath53  kms@xmath22kpc@xmath22 .",
    "we allow the simulation to evolve during @xmath54yr ( see figure  [ gilgosim ] ) . by this time ,",
    "the gas develops spiral arms as a response to the imposed perturbation , initial transients subside , and changes in the simulation are only observable at very long time scales .",
    "therefore , we assume that density and velocity distributions at this time represent a close approximation to a steady state solution .",
    "as shown in figure  [ gilgosim ] , the gas in the simulation has responded to the spiral perturbation with a four arm pattern @xcite .",
    "a hypothetical circular gas orbit would encounter four shocks before completing its transit around the disk . in this case",
    ", the corresponding velocity field would be very different from the case where only two shocks are considered .",
    "for the present investigation we focus on the main shock ( i.e. , the one closer to the potential minimum of the spiral perturbation ) , although spiral - arm triggering of star formation may also take place in the secondary shocks .    in order to obtain the orbit a parcel of gas would follow ,",
    "we locate the main shock position by searching for the gas density maxima closest to the ( stellar ) spiral arms .",
    "these are taken as the start point for the integration of the gaseous orbits .",
    "the orbits are then calculated from the velocity data ( in the spiral pattern reference frame ) , using a runge - kutta method , every @xmath55kpc , and @xmath56s .",
    "a sample of orbits are shown in figure  [ gorbits ] .",
    "other gas orbits with mhd simulations using the full time evolution of the gas can be seen in  @xcite , who find a close resemblance between gas orbits and the central family of ballistic orbits in stellar dynamics .",
    "from the first approach , involving semi - analytical solutions , we obtain @xmath5 index profiles for the non - circular and circular cases , respectively , calculated in a narrow annulus with mean radius @xmath57 kpc ; we show them in figure  [ diff_q ] . to produce the @xmath5 profiles , we assume a background population of old stars with an age of @xmath58 yr ( i.e. , the density wave ) , plus a young burst of star formation lasting @xmath59 yr .",
    "both the old and the young populations have a salpeter imf , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for the present case , we adopt a constant fraction of young stars of 2%  by mass ( see equation 9 in mg09 ) .",
    "we then use the stellar population synthesis models by @xcite to find the changing @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 emission of the population mixture as it evolves .    in the circular case ,",
    "the stellar complexes that give origin to the @xmath5 profile were all born at the same ( @xmath62 ) position . in the non - circular case , due to the trajectories of the gas streamlines , the stars that give rise to the @xmath5 profiles",
    "were not all formed at the same location .",
    "the age of the stellar complexes that contribute to the @xmath5 profile as a function of distance from the shock position is plotted in figure  [ diff_t ] .",
    "as expected , young objects tend to spend more time concentrated toward the spiral shock ( @xmath63 kpc ) , with the consequence that the peak of the @xmath5 profile ( _ dashed line _ in figure  [ diff_q ] ) occurs closer to the shock .",
    "another aspect to be noticed in figure  [ diff_q ] is that there is no  downstream fall \" of the gradients ( i.e. , @xmath5 does not fall below , in this case , @xmath64 , contrariwise to what is sometimes observed with the data ) .",
    "@xcite had hypothesized that the fall of the observed @xmath5 profiles below the model values ( assuming pure circular orbits ) might be caused by stellar non - circular motions in the data .",
    "however , results may differ if ballistic trajectories with postshock velocities are considered  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      from the @xmath5 profiles , it is possible to derive pattern speeds by comparing stellar population synthesis models ( @xmath5 vs.  @xmath15 ) to the  data \" ( @xmath5 vs.  @xmath17 ) , assuming implicitly that stars move in circular orbits , as was done by gg96 and mg09 , and was sketched above in section [ themethod ] .    in the case of the semi - analytical approach , ",
    "data \" @xmath5 profiles were obtained from narrow annular regions , @xmath65 kpc wide .",
    "given that we know the input pattern speed , we can search for systematic effects in the determination of @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ delayt ] shows the input pattern speed ( _ long - dashed line _ ) , and @xmath0 values that are obtained from the color gradients for three different presuppositions about the delay of star formation onset after the shock ( 0 , 10 , and 20 myr ) . for reasons explained below in  ",
    "[ lnrcoll ] , rather than stretching the stellar population synthesis model to the  data \" , we just compare the positions of the maxima of the model @xmath5 , on the one hand , and of the shock location , on the other .    there is a significant systematic effect , whereby the derived @xmath0 is always larger than the input pattern speed ; moreover , the effect decreases with galactocentric radius .",
    "also , the difference between the input and the output pattern speeds decreases for larger star formation onset delays .    in the case of the mhd simulations",
    ", we again analyze the pattern speeds derived when assuming a circular motion dynamic model . in order to obtain @xmath0",
    ", we compare the peak value of @xmath5 in the stellar population model to the density maximum of the gas in the simulations . in figure",
    "[ apcm ] , we show the @xmath18 values obtained for @xmath66 of 0 , 10 , and 20 myr .",
    "one of the caveats of the gg96 method , that was not discussed in mg09 , comes from image processing .",
    "each pixel in the optical and infrared images actually contains information about many young stellar orbits that all fall within the same spatial region .",
    "the process of  unwrapping \" the spiral arms then averages pixels in the @xmath10 and @xmath67 directions ( the  straightening \" of the arms is just a shift in the @xmath10 direction and does not involve pixel averaging ) . in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the @xmath5 profiles , an additional averaging in the @xmath67 direction",
    "is done in selected regions .",
    "this last step averages together orbits with different angular speeds , and hence stars of slightly different ages at a fixed distance from the shock .",
    "figure  [ cavfig ] shows the behavior of @xmath5 profiles from an unwrapped and straightened synthetic image ( see below ) , under the assumption of pure circular motion ; the different profiles are taken from various mean radii , after averaging in @xmath67 .",
    "the shift of the peak toward @xmath63 is expected as we approach the corotation radius . however , due to the pixel averaging , a drop in the maximum value of @xmath5 is also obtained . if , in order to match the observed or synthetic profile peak , a constant downward shift is applied to the stellar population synthesis model , the `` wings '' of the profiles will not match , since those of the stellar model will now lie within the `` wings '' of the data .",
    "this mimics wider gradients , and in order to fit the observed or synthetic profile we will need to overstretch the model .",
    "consequently , the pattern speed obtained via equation  [ eqomega ] will be lower , because the stellar age ( @xmath15 ) at a fixed distance @xmath17 from the shock will be underestimated . the effect amounts to @xmath68 1 to 2 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 for moderate pixel averaging , but can be as large as 10 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 when the averaged region in @xmath67 is very extended .",
    "one way out of this problem is to compare only the distances between the onset of star formation and the @xmath5 peak , in the model and the data , instead of the whole @xmath5 profiles , since image processing affects less the peak positions than the profile shapes .",
    "we have used this approach with our semi - analytical calculations and mhd simulations ; unfortunately , in the case of real data , the position of the star formation onset is generally unknown ( see also    [ appr1_sub ] ) .    to better estimate the effects of averaging , with the @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath27 ( time elapsed since the shock",
    ", @xmath27=0 corresponds to the shock location ) data of the streamlines obtained from the semi - analytical solutions , we constructed images of a synthetic  galaxy \" as it would be observed in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands with the aid of stellar population synthesis models @xcite ( the fraction of young stars constitute is @xmath71 by mass ) .",
    "the model face - on galaxy is at a distance of 35 mpc and the synthetic images have @xmath72 pixels .",
    "whenever various streamlines were located at the same pixel , their elapsed times since the shock were averaged .",
    "next , the synthetic images were unwrapped .",
    "each hyperpixel of the unwrapped images is @xmath73 long in the @xmath10 axis ; the @xmath67 axis has 250 hyperpixels in total , from the center of the galaxy to @xmath25 kpc .",
    "then , the synthetic unwrapped images were straightened according to the shock s pitch angle ( @xmath74 ) , that is smaller than the potential minimum s pitch angle ( @xmath75 ; see appendix  [ appsemianalyt ] ) . finally , @xmath5 profiles were obtained from these  images \" in sections with a width of 5 hypercolumns in @xmath67 .",
    "pattern speeds were measured by comparing the  observed \" @xmath5 ( vs.  @xmath17 ) from the simulated images , at different radii , with @xmath5 ( vs.  @xmath15 ) from stellar population synthesis models .. models with higher upper limits would peak at younger ages , closer to the shock ; see mg09 for models with an imf upper mass limit of 100 @xmath76 . ]    in figure  [ myomegas ] , we illustrate the effects of averaging .",
    "the dotted line is the input pattern speed .",
    "if the synthetic galaxy has circular orbits and the galaxy is analyzed assuming circular orbits , then one obtains the @xmath0 values depicted by squares .",
    "the solid black squares are obtained with the gg96  stretching \" method , whereas the comparison between model and data @xmath5 maxima positions relative to the shock yields the open symbols .",
    "clearly , the solid black squares are biased while the open ones are not .    on the other hand , if the synthetic galaxy has non - circular orbits but is analyzed under the assumption of circular orbits , then one obtains the @xmath18 values shown as triangles .",
    "the solid black triangles are the values obtained with the gg96 method ; the empty triangles are the pattern speeds found when comparing only the positions , relative to the shock location , of model and  observed \" @xmath5 peaks ; and the solid line represents the biased values measured from the semi - analytical solutions , without averaging , if existing non - circular motions are ignored .",
    "the reason for this bias towards higher measured pattern speeds is that real gas streamlines in a steady rotating spiral shock turn somewhat along the arm after passing through the shock .",
    "consequently , stars close to the shock are slightly older than would be expected in a circular model with the same @xmath0 .",
    "the observer using a circular model would infer that the gas flow into the arms is smaller than is actually the case , i.e. , that the difference between the stellar orbital velocity and the pattern speed is smaller than in reality ; inward of corotation , this means that the observer would overestimate the pattern speed . also inside corotation ,",
    "the effect decreases with galactocentric radius , as the shock strength diminishes .",
    "the open triangles product of the peak comparison are much less sensitive to the competing systematics introduced by orbit averaging .",
    "however , ironically , the original  stretching \" method ( solid black triangles ) seems much less biased towards higher values if non - circular motions are neglected , although the dependence of the bias on galactocentric radius is still noticeable .",
    "this is a fortunate turn of events , because ( 1 ) in real images it is hard to pinpoint the location of the star formation onset , and ( 2 ) the radial dependence of the bias allows us to detect the presence of non - circular motions and to confirm the link between star formation and disk dynamics .",
    "from theory  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is well known that the spiral shock strength diminishes as one approaches corotation .",
    "the shock weakening implies fewer radial movements and more circular trajectories .",
    "figures  [ delayt ] ( corotation radius , @xmath77 , located at @xmath78 kpc ) and [ apcm ] ( @xmath79 kpc ) support this conclusion ; they also allow us to predict that , in general , @xmath0 values derived from color gradients observed inside corotation in real data will be too high if a circular dynamic model is adopted . 6 and 8.5 kpc ) in the mhd simulation , the measured @xmath18 will be actually slightly lower ( @xmath68 1 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 ) than the input pattern speed of 20 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 . ] for color gradients observed beyond corotation , we expect again to overestimate the pattern speed , but the difference between the actual and the measured @xmath18 will now grow with radius . in this case , the radial velocities of the streamlines after the shock have an outward , rather than an inward , component ( see leading case in * ? ? ?",
    "if , however , spiral shocks are not as strong as inside corotation , inverse post - corotation gradients will yield unbiased pattern speed measurements .",
    "how would these results affect the @xcite conclusions about the end points of spiral patterns ?",

    "the @xmath87 values show the trend with radius expected from figures  [ delayt ] and  [ apcm ]",
    ". this would imply that we are actually detecting non - circular motions from the photometric data !    however , three discrepancies with respect to theoretical expectations are also present .",
    "the first one is related to the systematic effects discussed in appendix  [ lnrcoll ] . in spite of the tendency to actually measure values around the true pattern speed with the method used by gg96 and mg09 ( solid black triangles in figure  [ myomegas ] ) ,",
    "there is a lack of points below the @xmath91 line .",
    "the second difference is the gap around @xmath92 , where a point with huge vertical error bars is located .",
    "if spirals are really truncated at the 4:1 resonance , and hence inside or near corotation , one would expect a continuous distribution of points between the ilr and the spiral end point ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) .",
    "the third inconsistency concerns the actual values attained by @xmath87 at low @xmath89 . from the solid black triangles in figure  [ myomegas ] , the maximum expected value of @xmath87 is @xmath94 .",
    "the high @xmath87 values would imply the presence of extremely strong shocks near the spiral arms .",
    "figure  [ diffom_olr ] , in contrast , shows the behavior of @xmath87 for the case when the spiral end points are fixed at the olr .",
    "if spirals stop near this resonance , the expected @xmath89 value for corotation is @xmath95 , and the gap in the data distribution is naturally explained .",
    "we also observe now that some points are located below the @xmath91 line , as expected from figure  [ myomegas ] , owing to the systematic error introduced by the  stretching \" gg96 method and discussed in    [ lnrcoll ] .",
    "the three last points , marked with a long - dashed ellipse , represent the `` inverse color gradients '' ( i.e. , located beyond corotation ) examined in mg09 ( these points were treated as being inside corotation in figure  [ diffom_4_1 ] ) .",
    "the points surrounded by a short - dashed ellipse belong to the galaxy ngc 578 .",
    "if ngc 578 actually ends before or at corotation ( as argued by mg09 ) , its position in figure  [ diffom_4_1 ] is in concordance with theoretical expectations ( i.e. , close to the @xmath91 line ) . on the other hand",
    ", ngc 578 may be the only galaxy in the mg09 sample with a spiral pattern that stops at the 4:1 resonance , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "under the assumption that the orbits of young stars preserve the velocity components of the parent molecular clouds where they form , we have analyzed the effects that non - circular motions would have on azimuthal color gradients .",
    "semi - analytical calculations and mhd simulations show that the spiral pattern speeds derived from the comparison between color gradients and stellar population synthesis models , assuming purely circular motions , would have values systematically higher than the real ones for regions within corotation . also inside corotation",
    ", the effect would decrease with galactocentric radius .",
    "non - circular motions , however , would not prevent the detection of legitimate azimuthal color gradients in real galaxies . using a synthetic image ,",
    "we have also analyzed the effects of image processing and pixel averaging on the method applied in gg06 and mg09 to detect color gradients and derive pattern speeds .",
    "we have found that pixel averaging ( due to image processing ) systematically decreases the derived @xmath0 , such that it nearly compensates for the systematic effect introduced when neglecting non - circular motions in the analysis .",
    "the net result is that the correct spiral pattern speeds and resonance locations can be obtained .",
    "nevertheless , a residual trend of slightly higher pattern speeds at lower radii can still be discerned ( _ solid _ triangles in fig .",
    "[ myomegas ] and fig .",
    "[ diffom_olr ] ) , so that it is possible to detect the presence of non - circular motions and confirm the link between star formation and disk dynamics .",
    "we have re - examined the results obtained by mg09 . when normalizing the mean radii where gradients were found by the end point radii , in order to treat the whole sample as a single galaxy , we were able to reproduce the trend of @xmath87 with radius expected if non - circular motions are ignored ( as these authors did ) .",

    "future studies of azimuthal color gradients in disk galaxies by orbit calculations should include the effects of disk heating @xcite , and a correct modeling of the imf as a discrete distribution .",

    "the differential equations needed to obtain the density and velocity components , product of spiral shocks , are fully explained in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the independent parameters used in this investigation for the solutions are : number of arms , @xmath96 ; spiral arms pitch angle @xmath3 such that @xmath97 ; angular speed of the spiral pattern , @xmath98 km s@xmath22 kpc@xmath22 ; effective speed of sound , @xmath99 km s@xmath22 ; amplitude ratio of the perturbed spiral field to the axisymmetric field , @xmath100 ; rotation velocity of material , .",
    "we also assume that @xmath101constant for the selected range of radii ( 5 - 10 kpc ) . ]",
    "@xmath102 km s@xmath22 . in figure",
    "[ etasp ] , we show the positions of the sonic point and the spiral shock relative to the potential minimum ( @xmath103 ) , with the parameters described above . as already noticed by @xcite and @xcite , the shock front moves away from the potential minimum as the radius increases . in this case , for @xmath104 kpc , the shock front is slightly ahead of the potential minimum .",
    "these relative positions may change for another set of parameters .",
    "the solutions are obtained in curvilinear coordinates @xmath105 ( perpendicular to the spiral equipotential curves ) and @xmath106 ( parallel to the spiral equipotential curves ) .",
    "we adopt the @xmath105 and @xmath106 definitions from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these definitions differ from those used in @xcite and @xcite by a multiplicative factor @xmath107 , and by an additive constant , chosen such that @xmath103 determines the location of the potential minumum .",
    "the corresponding expressions in terms of the radius , @xmath69 , and the angular coordinate in the rotating frame of the spiral pattern , @xmath108 , are as follows :        the @xmath105 coordinate is obtained from the shock solution , together with the velocity components @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the subscript 0 labels the unperturbed velocity ( i.e. , in absence of a spiral perturbation ) , and the subscript 1 , the perturbation due to the spiral gravitational field .",
    "the @xmath106 coordinate is obtained by solving the equation :        the shock on the subsonic branch occurs at @xmath115 and @xmath116 . @xmath117 and @xmath118 are coordinate values at any point along the streamline ; their maximum possible values are @xmath119 and @xmath120 , i.e. , the point at which the shock occurs on the supersonic branch .. in theory , @xmath121 but , due to a slight nonclosure of the streamlines with radius , the numerical values may differ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "]    in order to obtain @xmath116 , we proceed in the way described below .",
    "we define the quantity : @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the @xmath125 and @xmath70 values obtained when @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "<S> we find that , if non - circular motions are ignored , the comparison between observed color gradients and stellar population synthesis models would in principle yield pattern speed values that are systematically too high for regions inside corotation , with the difference between the real and the measured pattern speeds increasing with decreasing radius . on the other hand , image processing and pixel averaging result in systematically lower measured spiral pattern speed values , regardless of the kinematics of stellar orbits . </S>",
    "<S> the net effect is that roughly the correct pattern speeds are recovered , although the trend of higher measured @xmath0 at lower radii ( as expected when non - circular motions exist but are neglected ) should still be observed . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the @xcite photometric data and confirm that this is indeed the case . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the size of the systematic pattern speed offset in the data with the predictions of the semi - analytical and mhd models corroborates that spirals are more likely to end at outer lindblad resonance , as these authors had already found . </S>"
