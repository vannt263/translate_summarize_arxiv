    "a significant limitation to unambiguous planet detection in circumstellar disks is the contaminating thermal emission from dust in the target systems .",
    "we propose to turn this hazard into an advantage for detecting and characterizing planetary systems.the major goal of the present letter is to explore how the presence of the planet(s ) impacts the disk via particular resonances responsible for the specific asymmetric features in the dust , and how these features would enable us to derive the major parameters of the yet invisible planetary system .",
    "the major obstacle in providing reliable , high - resolution numerical simulations  the particle - number limitation  is solved by our recently elaborated very efficient approach to numerical modeling of distributions of test particles in an external gravitational field ( ozernoy , gorkavyi , & taidakova 1998 , 2000 ; gorkavyi et al .",
    "2000 ; taidakova & gorkavyi 1999 ) .",
    "both the poynting - robertson ( p - r ) and stellar wind drags tend to induce dust inflow toward the star .",
    "as the dust passes by the planets in its infall , it interacts with them by accumulating in the outer planetary resonances , which , as we demonstrate below , could serve as an efficient means of planet detection .",
    "the existence of a resonance ring associated with the earth s orbit was predicted by jackson & zook ( 1989 ) ; such a ring was indeed discovered in the _ iras _ ( dermott et al .",
    "1994 ) and _ cobe _ ( reach et al . 1995 ) data .",
    "the resonant design in the dust depends upon the capture probability , the particle lifetime in the resonance , the amplitude of libration , and the typical eccentricity of resonant particles .",
    "the total mass of dust contained in a particular resonance is the product of the probability for the dust particle being captured into the resonance , @xmath7 ; the lifetime spent in the resonance , @xmath8 ( in a sufficiently dense environment , this time is due to particle collisions ) ; and the total dust flow per unit time in the vicinity of the resonance , @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 . having introduced , for convenience , the mass of ` background ' dust , @xmath11 , one gets @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the minimal timescale of the p - r drag ( @xmath14 ) , gravitational scattering ( @xmath15 ) , and collisional ( @xmath16 ) characteristic times .",
    "three particular cases are well distinguishable :    1 : @xmath17 . actually , this collisionless case is realized , for example , for neptune in the solar system .",
    "assuming that @xmath18 , one gets @xmath19 . to get a discernable resonant structure",
    ", one needs to have @xmath20 .    2 : @xmath21 .",
    "this case is realized for a rather massive planet like jupiter .",
    "if collisions are essential ( as they are for vega s disk , see backman 1998 ) , then @xmath22 and one gets @xmath23 .",
    "the resonant structure has a high - contrast if @xmath24 .    3 : @xmath25 . in this collisional case one",
    "has @xmath26 giving @xmath27 , which results in a high - contrast resonant structure whenever @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that if collisions of resonant particles are important ( cases 2 and 3 ) , the resonant pattern can nevertheless exist ( cf .",
    "wyatt et al . 1999 ) as long as a source of particle replenishment is available .",
    "3.1 . _ the procedure _",
    "the simplest planetary system under consideration , consisting of just one planet ( orbiting a star of mass @xmath29 at a circular orbit of radius @xmath30 ) possesses only mean motion resonances , without most of secular resonances ( except the kozai resonances ) .",
    "we have computed about 300 model disks in order to explore the effects of various resonances adopting the following parameters : ( 1 ) the mass of the planet , @xmath31 ; ( 2 ) the particle size coupled with stellar luminosity and mass , as described by the parameter @xmath32 , which is the ratio of the stellar light pressure and the gravitational force applied to the dust grain of density 2 g  @xmath33 and radius @xmath34 ( in @xmath35 m ) , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the star s luminosity and mass in solar units ; and ( 3 ) lifetime of dust particles , @xmath13 .",
    "below , we describe some of these models .    3.2 . _ typical resonant structures exemplified by the _    _ resonances 1:1 , 2:1 , 3:1 , and 3:2 _    in the absence of a planet , the surface density of dust between the star and the pericenter of dust sources is constant , while the number density of dust varies as @xmath38 , @xmath34 being heliocentric distance ( gorkavyi et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of a planet induces dramatic changes in the dust distribution .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 , which shows the geometry of dust distribution in different mean motion resonances with the planet .    in the resonance 1:1 , the orbits responsible for the dust design are of three kinds : ( 1 ) a horseshoe - like orbit that embraces the two lagrange points l4 and l5 ( see fig .",
    "1a ) ; ( 2 ) an orbit with a small libration around l4 ( fig .",
    "1b , _ upper feature _ ) ; and ( 3 ) an orbit with a substantial libration around l5 ( fig .  1b , _ lower feature _ ) .",
    "the dust structure in the resonance 2:1 looks similarly : the inner orbital loop precesses relative to l4 and l5 in the same way as the epicycle of particles in the 1:1 resonance .",
    "that loop can form a horse - like arc along the planet s orbit ( fig .",
    "1c ) or can librate near either l4 or l5 ( fig .",
    "1d illustrates the case of a large libration ) .",
    "in the resonance 3:1 , the dust particles librate around the l4 with a smaller amplitude ( fig .",
    "1e ) ; no horse - like libration has been observed .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "1f illustrates the resonance 3:2 with an appreciable libration , which results in a symmetric four - clump pattern .",
    "when libration is small , the resonance contains a two - clump pattern .    in all cases mentioned above",
    ", the vicinity of the planet is free of dust .",
    "each resonant dust structure is accompanied by other specific caverns in dust distribution ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "dependence of structure on location of dust sources _    the scattered cometary population produces dust whose distribution in orbital elements tends to be rather smooth .",
    "a well - pronounced resonant structure in the dust can only be formed if there is a planet that massive enough to capture some dust particles into resonances and to eject the remaining non - resonant dust particles out ( case 2 in sec .  2 ) .",
    "dust sources like the kuiper belt objects ( kbos ; hereafter ` kuiperoids ' ) , of which a substantial part is in resonances , can produce the contrast resonant structures if ( 1 ) the drifting dust particles have a long lifetime and eventually are captured into resonances ( the situation is similar to the formation of a resonant dust belt near the neptunian orbit in the solar system ) or ( 2 ) both @xmath39 and the lifetime of dust particles are small enough , so that the particles produced by the resonant kuiperoids can not leave the resonances and thereby they form resonant structures ( case 3 in sec .  2 ) .",
    "orbits of resonant objects look similar to dust orbits shown in fig .  1 .    3.4 . _",
    "dependence of structure on planetary mass _    .",
    "this dependence can be revealed from a variety of available runs with different parameters .",
    "a low - mass planet , like earth or neptune , forms a resonant ring along the planetary orbit associated with high - order resonances , like 3:2 , 4:3 , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. fig .",
    "1f ) . for more massive planets , the resonances like 2:1 , 3:1 , etc .",
    "become essential , whereas the innermost resonances overlap ( e.g. wisdom 1980 ) .",
    "since the libration amplitude decreases as @xmath31 increases , clumps similar to those seen in fig.1e ( and not arcs like those shown in fig .",
    "1d ) would be typical for @xmath31 as large as @xmath40 , where @xmath40 is jupiter s mass .",
    "let us consider some observational signatures of planets embedded in disks .",
    "figures 2a and 2b show the thermal emission from the simulated disks ( seen face - on ) with an embedded planet , and these are to be compared with the available observational data on vega and @xmath5 eri shown in figures 2c and 2d , respectively ( the parent stars are seen almost pole - on ) .    as a hotter star , vega might result in a more extensive , compared to @xmath5 eri , dust production from evaporating comets .",
    "we adopt @xmath41 ( close to an upper limit of @xmath42 at which the dust particle escapes ) and @xmath43 planet revolutions consistent with @xmath44 yrs ( backman 1998 ) .",
    "a planet as massive as @xmath45 induces the resonances @xmath46 , which results in two dusty clumps on either side of the planet , while the planet ejects the remaining non - resonant dust particles out ( case 2 in sec .  2 ) .",
    "thus , even if the distribution of the cometary population around vega might be symmetric , ejection of non - resonant particles by the planet could make the resonant dust pattern highly asymmetric ( fig .",
    "2a ) , which is reminiscent of the observed two asymmetric clumps near vega shown in fig .",
    "2c ( holland et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast to vega , @xmath5 eri is a less massive and a colder star with @xmath47 . besides",
    ", the typical size of dust particles is several times larger than in vega s disk ( backman 1998 ) , therefore we adopt @xmath48 for the dust in @xmath5 eri s disk . assuming that kuiperoids serve as the main source of dust in this disk , we find that the dust    distribution might reflect the distribution of the sources located mostly in the resonances such as 2:1 and 3:2 . in this case ,",
    "a comparatively small planetary mass of @xmath49 is able to induce , via libration , two arcs , with a pair of clumps at their edges ( fig .",
    "even if the dust is distributed in equal proportions to both resonances , one could easily get an asymmetry seen in fig .",
    "2b by assuming that 10% of comets in the resonance 2:1 have a smaller libration amplitude in the lower branch of the pattern .",
    "a similar asymmetric structure has been revealed in the submillimeter imagery of the @xmath5  eri disk shown in fig .",
    "2d ( greaves et al . 1998 ) .    our modeling , which indicates that vega may have a planet of mass @xmath45 at a distance of @xmath50 au , and @xmath5  eri may have a less massive planet of @xmath51 at a similar distance of @xmath52 au , is testable .",
    "each resonant feature is stationary in the reference frame corotating with the planet , but it is not so for the observer at earth .",
    "therefore , if our interpretation of asymmetric clumps as a dynamical resonant structure is correct , the above asymmetric feature revolves around the star ( probably , counterclockwise ) with an angular velocity of @xmath53@xmath54 ( vega ) and @xmath55@xmath56 ( @xmath5  eri )  a prediction that can be tested within several years .",
    "if confirmed , the proposed interpretation of the structure in vega- and @xmath5 eri  like circumstellar disks seen face - on would make it possible not just to reveal the embedded planet and determine its semimajor axis , but also to constrain its other basic parameters , such as the planet s mass and even to pinpoint the position of the planet ( see figs .",
    "2a and 2b ) .",
    "as we demonstrated above , highly asymmetric structures in the circumstellar disk and a central ` hole ' void of dust can serve as indicators of at least one planet embedded in the disk .",
    "the numerical simulations described above lead to the following major conclusions :    \\1 . the outermost planet in an exo - planetary system can produce : ( _ a _ ) an asymmetric resonant dust belt consisting of arc(s ) and one or more clumps intermittent with one or a few cavities ; and ( _ b _ ) a central cavity void of dust .",
    "the morphology of these belts and cavities ( size , asymmetry , number of clumps , and their pattern ) depends upon particular resonances involved and is eventually a function of the planetary mass , location of dust sources , and @xmath39 .",
    ". the crucial test of the above picture would be the discovery of revolution of the resonant asymmetric structure around the star . for circumstellar disks in vega and @xmath57eri",
    "the asymmetric design is expected to revolve , respectively , by @xmath53@xmath58 and @xmath55@xmath59 annually .    in sum ,",
    "our numerical simulations offer a possibility to reveal the presence of the planet(s ) in a circumstellar dusty disk seen pole - on and , under further development , could provide a method for determination of planetary parameters using the visible morphology of an outer part of the disk .",
    "the proposed approach seems to be sufficiently powerful to provide also the interpretation of disks seen edge - on in scattered light , such as the @xmath39 pic disk revealed by stis optical observations ( heap et al . 2000 ) .    .",
