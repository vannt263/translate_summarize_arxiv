    "<S> the spatial distribution of partons in the proton can be probed in suitable exclusive scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> i report on recent performance estimates for parton imaging at a proposed electron - ion collider .    deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and exclusive meson production in lepton - proton collisions offer unique possibilities for determining the spatial distribution of quarks , antiquarks and gluons as a function of their longitudinal momentum inside the proton . </S>",
    "<S> such `` tomographic images '' of the proton can provide insight into key aspects of qcd dynamics , such as the interplay between sea quarks and gluons , the relation between sea and valence quarks , and the orbital angular momentum carried by these partons .    to obtain such images one needs to measure the transverse momentum transfer @xmath0 to the proton . </S>",
    "<S> a fourier transform then gives the distribution in impact parameter @xmath1 , which is the position of the struck parton in the plane transverse to the proton direction of movement . in the scattering amplitude </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath2 of the parton is integrated over , with typical values around @xmath3 for dvcs and @xmath4 for the production of a meson with mass @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction of a joint density in @xmath2 and @xmath1 can be envisaged in the framework of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) by making use of their evolution in the resolution scale , which is given by @xmath6 in dvcs and by @xmath7 in meson production . </S>",
    "<S> this requires precise data in a very wide range of @xmath8 and @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> measurements from hera suggest that at @xmath2 around @xmath9 gluons have a more narrow impact parameter distribution than sea quarks . </S>",
    "<S> information about the spatial distribution of valence quarks can be inferred from electromagnetic form factors and from lattice calculations , and a direct study of quarks with large momentum fraction @xmath2 will be possible with the 12 gev upgrade at jefferson lab </S>",
    "<S> . the planned dvcs measurement by compass will give us a first glimpse into the @xmath2 region between @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
