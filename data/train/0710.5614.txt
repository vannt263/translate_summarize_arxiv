    "a geodesic flow in a given direction on a translation surface induces on a transverse segment an interval exchange map .",
    "dynamic of such transformations has been extensively studied during these last thirty years providing applications to billiards in rational polygons , to measured foliations on surfaces , to teichmller geometry and dynamics , etc .",
    "interval exchange transformations are closely related to abelian differentials on riemann surfaces .",
    "it is well known that the continued fractions encode cutting sequences of hyperbolic geodesics on the poincar upper half - plane .",
    "similarly , the rauzy - veech induction ( analogous to euclidean algorithm ) provides a discrete model for the teichmller geodesics flow ( @xcite ) .    using this relation h.  masur in  @xcite and w.  a.  veech in  @xcite",
    "have independently proved the keane s conjecture ( unique ergodicity of almost all interval exchange transformations ) .",
    "using combinatorics of rauzy classes , kontsevich and zorich classified the connected components of strata of the moduli spaces of abelian differentials  @xcite .",
    "more recently , avila , gouzel and yoccoz proved the exponential decay of correlations for the teichmller geodesic flow also using a renormalization of the rauzy - veech induction ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "avila and viana used combinatorics of rauzy - veech induction to prove the simplicity of the essential part of the lyapunov spectrum of the teichmller geodesic flow on the strata of abelian differentials ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "recently bufetov and gurevich proved the existence and uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy for the teichmller geodesic flow on the moduli space of abelian differentials  @xcite .",
    "avila and forni proved the weak mixing for almost all interval exchange transformations and translation flows  @xcite .",
    "these examples show that rauzy - veech induction which was initially elaborated to prove ergodicity of interval exchange transformations and ergodicity of the teichmller geodesic flow is , actually , very efficient far beyond these initial problems .    however , all the aforementioned results concern only the moduli space of abelian differentials . the corresponding questions for strata of strict quadratic differentials ( i.e. of those , which are not global squares of abelian differentials ) remain open .",
    "note that the ( co)tangent bundle to the moduli space of curves is naturally identified with the moduli space of _ quadratic _ differentials . from this point of view",
    ", the strata of abelian differentials represent special orbifolds of high codimension in the total space of the tangent bundle .",
    "our interest in teichmller dynamics and geometry of the strata of strict quadratic differentials was one of the main motivations for developing rauzy - veech induction for quadratic differentials .",
    "natural generalizations of interval exchange transformations were introduced by danthony and nogueira in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) as cross sections of measured foliations on surfaces .",
    "they introduced the notion of linear involutions , as well as the notion of rauzy induction on these maps .",
    "studying lyapunov spectrum of the teichmller geodesic flow kontsevich and zorich have performed series of computer experiments with linear involutions corresponding to quadratic differentials  @xcite .",
    "these experiments indicated appearance of attractors for the rauzy - veech induction , as well as examples of generalized permutations such that the corresponding linear involutions are minimal for a domain of parameters of positive measure , and non minimal for a complementary domain of parameters also of positive measure ( examples of this type are presented in figure  [ rauzy : class:2ii ] and figure  [ fig : rauzy:2 ] in appendix @xmath2 ) .",
    "but at this point , there was no combinatorial explanation .",
    "thus , in order to generalize technique of rauzy - veech induction to quadratic differentials in a consistent way it was necessary to find combinatorial criteria allowing to identify generalized permutations , which belong to attractors and those ones , which represents cross sections of vertical foliations of quadratic differentials .",
    "it was also necessary to distinguish those generalized permutation which give rise to minimal linear involution , and to specify the domains of appropriate parameters .    in this paper",
    "we establish corresponding combinatorial criteria , which enable us to develop technique of rauzy - veech induction for quadratic differentials .",
    "partial results in this direction were obtained by the second author in  @xcite .",
    "we also study relations between combinatorics , geometry and dynamics of linear involutions .    to compare similarities and differences between linear involutions corresponding to abelian and to quadratic differentials let us first briefly review the situation in the classical case .",
    "an interval exchange transformation is encoded by a combinatorial data ( permutation @xmath3 on @xmath4 elements ) and by a continuous data ( lengths @xmath5 of the intervals ) .",
    "recall that the keane s property ( see below ) is a criterion of `` irrationality '' ( which , in particular , implies minimality ) of an interval exchange transformation .",
    "this property is satisfied for almost all parameters @xmath6 when the permutation @xmath3 is irreducible ( i.e. @xmath7 , while when @xmath3 is reducible , the corresponding interval exchange map is _ never _ minimal . on the other hand",
    "the irrational interval exchange maps are precisely those that arise as cross sections of minimal vertical flows on well chosen transverse intervals .",
    "the rauzy - veech induction consists in taking the first return map of an interval exchange transformation to an appropriate smaller interval .",
    "this induction can be viewed as a dynamical system on a finite - dimensional space of interval exchange maps .",
    "the behavior of an orbit of the induction provides important information on dynamics of the interval exchange transformation representing the starting point .",
    "this information is especially useful when all iterates are well defined and when the length of the underlying subintervals tends to zero .",
    "an interval exchange transformation satisfying the latter conditions is said to have _",
    "property_. for a given irreducible permutation @xmath3 , the subset of parameters @xmath6 which give rise to interval exchange transformations satisfying keane s property contains all irrational parameters , and so it is a full lebesgue measure subset .",
    "moreover , for the space of interval exchange transformations with irreducible combinatorial data , the renormalized induction process is recurrent with respect to the lebesgue measure ( and even ergodic by a theorem of veech ) . note that the corresponding invariant measure has infinite total mass .",
    "in this paper we use the definition of _ linear involution _   be the involution of @xmath8 given by @xmath9 .",
    "a linear involution is a map @xmath10 , from @xmath8 into itself , of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an involution of @xmath8 without fixed point , continuous except in finitely many points , and which preserves the lebesgue measure . in this paper",
    "we will only consider linear involutions with the additional condition .",
    "the derivative of @xmath12 is @xmath13 at @xmath14 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 belong to the same connected component , and @xmath13 otherwise ; see also convention  [ convention : oriented ] . ]",
    "proposed by danthony and nogueira ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "as above , a _ linear involution _ is encoded by a combinatorial data ( `` generalized permutation '' ) and by continuous data .",
    "a generalized permutation of type @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 ) is a two - to - one map @xmath18 to an alphabet @xmath19 .",
    "a generalized permutation is called _ irreducible _ if there exists a linear involution associated to this generalized permutation , which represents an appropriate cross section of the vertical foliation of some quadratic differential . a generalized permutation",
    "is called _ dynamically irreducible _ if there exists a minimal linear involution associated to this generalized permutation .",
    "it is easy to show that any irreducible generalized permutation is dynamically irreducible ; the converse is not true in general as we will see .",
    "irreducible and dynamically irreducible generalized permutations can be characterized by natural criteria expressed in elementary combinatorial terms .",
    "the corresponding criteria are stated as definitions  [ def : irred ] and definition  [ def : dyn : irr ] respectively .",
    "consider a dynamically irreducible generalized permutation @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter space of normalized linear involutions associated to @xmath3 is represented by a hyperplane section of a simplex .",
    "we describe an explicit procedure which associates to each generalized permutation @xmath3 an open subset in the parameter space defined by a system of linear inequalities determined by @xmath3 .",
    "this subset is called the set of _",
    "admissible parameters_. when @xmath3 is irreducible , the set of admissible parameters coincides with entire parameter space ; in general it is smaller .",
    "the next result gives a more precise statement than theorem  @xmath2 in the dynamically irreducible case .",
    "@xmath20    1 .",
    "if @xmath3 is not dynamically irreducible , or if @xmath3 is dynamically irreducible , but @xmath6 does not belong to the set of admissible parameters , the linear involution @xmath21 is not minimal .",
    "if @xmath3 is dynamically irreducible , then for almost all admissible parameters @xmath6 the linear involution @xmath21 satisfies the keane s property , and hence is minimal .",
    "since the rauzy - veech induction commutes with dilatations , it projectivizes to a map @xmath22 on the space of normalized linear involutions ; we shall call this map",
    "the _ renormalized rauzy - veech induction_.    let t be a linear involution on the unit interval and let us consider a sequence @xmath23 of iterates by the renormalized rauzy - veech induction @xmath22 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath10 has the keane s property , then there exists @xmath24 such that @xmath25 is irreducible for all @xmath26 .",
    "the renormalized rauzy - veech induction , defined on the set @xmath27 , is recurrent .",
    "having a generalized permutation @xmath3 we can define one or two other generalized permutations @xmath28 and @xmath29 reflecting the possibilities for the image of the rauzy - veech induction @xmath30 .",
    "these combinatorial rauzy operations define a partial order in the set of irreducible permutations represented by an oriented graph .",
    "rauzy class _ is a connected component of this graph .",
    "note that geometry of the rauzy graphs is very different and more complicated than in the case of `` true '' permutations since for some irreducible generalized permutations one of the rauzy operations might be not defined . from theorem",
    "@xmath31 we will deduce that a rauzy class is an equivalence class for the equivalence relation given by these combinatorial operations ( see proposition  [ prop : classes ] ) .    in analogy with the case of the `` true '' permutations , we introduce one more combinatorial operation on generalized permutations and define _ extended rauzy classes _ as minimal subsets of irreducible generalized permutations invariant under these corresponding three operations .",
    "the moduli spaces of abelian differentials and of quadratic differentials are stratified by multiplicities of the zeroes of the corresponding differentials .",
    "we denote a stratum of the moduli space of strict quadratic differentials ( with at most simple poles ) by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the multiplicities of the zeroes ( @xmath34 corresponds to a pole ) .    extended rauzy classes of irreducible generalized permutations are in one - to - one correspondence with connected components of strata in the moduli spaces of quadratic differentials .",
    "historically , extended rauzy classes where used to prove the non - connectedness of some strata of abelian differentials . for permutations of a small number of elements , it is easy to construct explicitly the subset of irreducible permutations and then using the rauzy operations to decompose it into a disjoint union of extended rauzy classes . using this approach veech proved that the minimal stratum in genus @xmath35 has two connected components and arnoux proved that the minimal stratum in genus @xmath36 has three connected components ( for abelian differentials ) .    having established an explicit combinatorial criterion of irreducibility of a generalized permutation ( namely theorem  @xmath2 ) one can apply theorem  @xmath37 to classify the connected components of all strata of quadratic differentials of sufficiently small dimension .",
    "this justifies , in particular , the following experimental result of zorich .",
    "each of the following four exceptional strata of quadratic differentials @xmath38 and @xmath39 contains exactly two connected components .",
    "note that a theorem of the second author  @xcite classifies all connected components of all other strata of meromorphic quadratic differentials with at most simple poles .",
    "these strata are either connected , or contain exactly two connected components one of which being hyperelliptic .",
    "the same theorem  @xcite proves that each of the remaining four exceptional strata might have at most two connected components .",
    "however , the only currently available proof of the fact they are disconnected is the one based on explicit calculation of the extended rauzy classes and corresponds to the theorem of zorich",
    ". it would be interesting to have an algebraic - geometrico proof of the last theorem ; namely a topological invariant as in the kontsevich - zorich s classification  @xcite .",
    "note also that a paper of zorich  @xcite gives explicits representatives elements for each extended rauzy class .",
    "see also  @xcite for programs concerning calculations of these rauzy classes .    in section",
    "[ sec : iem ] we recall basic properties of flat surfaces , moduli spaces and interval exchange maps .",
    "in particular we recall the rauzy - veech induction and its dynamical properties .",
    "we relate these properties to irreducibility . + in section  [ sec : giem ] we recall the definition of a linear involution and give basics properties . then in section  [ combinatoric ] we define a combinatorial notion of irreducibility , and prove the first part of theorem  @xmath2 .",
    "the main tool we use to prove this theorem is the presentation proposed by marmi , moussa and yoccoz which appears in  @xcite + in section  [ sec : dyn ] we introduce the keane s property for the linear involutions and prove the second part of theorem  @xmath2 , that is theorem  @xmath40 .",
    "for that we prove that @xmath10 satisfies the keane s property if and only if the rauzy - veech induction is always well defined and the length parameters tends to zero . then if @xmath10 does not satisfy the keane s property we show that there exists @xmath24 such that @xmath41 is dynamically reducible which then implies that @xmath10 is also dynamically reducible .",
    "+ in section  [ dyn : rauzy : veech ] , we study the dynamics of the renormalized rauzy - veech map on the space of the linear involutions , and prove theorem  @xmath31 . for that we use the teichmller geometry and the finiteness of the volume of the strata proved by masur and veech ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "+ section  [ rauzy : classes : giem ] is devoted to a proof of theorem  @xmath37 on extended rauzy classes ; we present a result of zorich based on an explicit calculation of these classes in low genera .",
    "+ in the appendix we present some explicit rauzy classes as illustration of the problems which appear in the general case .",
    "we also give a property concerning the extended rauzy classes .",
    "we thank anton zorich for useful discussions .",
    "we thank arnaldo nogueira for comments and remarks on a preliminary version of this text . +",
    "this work was partially supported by the anr `` teichmller projet blanc '' anr-06-blan-0038 .",
    "in this section we review basic notions concerning flat surfaces , moduli spaces and interval exchange maps . for general references see say  @xcite and  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will mostly follows notations presented in the paper  @xcite , or equivalently  @xcite .",
    "a _ flat surface _ is a ( real , compact , connected ) genus @xmath42 surface equipped with a flat metric ( with isolated conical singularities ) such that the holonomy group belongs to @xmath43 . here",
    "holonomy means that the parallel transport of a vector along a long loop brings the vector back to itself or to its opposite .",
    "this implies that all cone angles are integer multiples of @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently a flat surface is a triple @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is a topological compact connected surface , @xmath46 is a finite subset of @xmath45 ( whose elements are called _ singularities _ ) and @xmath47 is an atlas of @xmath48 such that the transition maps @xmath49 are translations or half - turns : @xmath50 , and for each @xmath51 , there is a neighborhood of @xmath52 isometric to a euclidean cone .",
    "therefore we get a _ quadratic differential _",
    "defined locally in the coordinates @xmath53 by the formula @xmath54 .",
    "this form extends to the points of @xmath46 to zeroes , simple poles or marked points ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we will sometimes use the notation @xmath55 or simply @xmath45 .    observe that the holonomy is trivial if and only if there exists a sub - atlas such that all transition functions are translations or equivalently if the quadratic differentials @xmath56 is the global square of an abelian differential .",
    "we will then say that @xmath45 is a translation surface .      for @xmath57",
    ", we define the moduli space of abelian differentials @xmath58 as the set of pairs @xmath59 modulo the equivalence relation generated by : @xmath60 if there exists an analytic isomorphism @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",

    "we will denote by @xmath68 ( respectively @xmath69 ) the stratum consisting of holomorphic one - forms ( respectively quadratic differentials ) with @xmath70 zeroes ( or poles ) of multiplicities @xmath71 .",
    "these strata are non - connected in general ( for a complete classification see  @xcite in the abelian differentials case and  @xcite in the quadratic differentials case ) .",
    "the linear action of the @xmath72-parameter subgroup of diagonal matrices @xmath73 on the flat surfaces presents a particular interest .",
    "it gives a measure - preserving flow with respect to a natural measure @xmath74 , preserving each stratum of area one flat surfaces .",
    "this flow is known as the _ teichmller geodesic flow_. masur and veech proved the following theorem .",
    "the teichmller geodesic flow acts ergodically on each connected component of each stratum of the moduli spaces of area one abelian and quadratic differentials ( with respect to a finite measure in the lebesgue class ) .",

    "+ the ergodicity of the teichmller geodesic flow is proved in full generality in  @xcite , theorem  @xmath76 .",
    "the finiteness of the measure appears in two @xmath77 preprints of veech : dynamical systems on analytic manifolds of quadratic differentials i , ii ( see also  @xcite p.445 ) .",
    "these preprints have been published in @xmath78  @xcite .      in this section",
    "we recall briefly the theory of interval exchange maps .",
    "we will show that , under simple combinatorial conditions , such transformations arise naturally as poincar return maps of measured foliations and geodesic flows on translation surfaces .",
    "moreover we will present the rauzy - veech induction and its geometric and dynamical properties ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "let @xmath79 be an open interval and let us choose a finite subset @xmath80 of @xmath81 .",
    "its complement is a union of @xmath82 open subintervals .",
    "an interval exchange map is a one - to - one map @xmath10 from @xmath83 to a co - finite subset of @xmath81 that is a translation on each subinterval of its definition domain .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath10 is precisely determined by the following data : a permutation @xmath84 that encodes how the intervals are exchanged ( expressing that the k - th interval , when numerated from the left to the right , is sent by @xmath10 to the place @xmath85 ) , and a vector with positive entries that encodes the lengths of the intervals .",
    "following marmi , moussa , yoccoz  @xcite , we denote these intervals by @xmath86 , with @xmath19 a finite alphabet .",
    "the length of the intervals is a vector @xmath87 , and the combinatorial data is a pair @xmath88 of one - to - one maps @xmath89 .",

    "we will usually represent such a permutation by a table : @xmath92    [ example : permutation ] let us consider the following alphabet @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "then we define a permutation @xmath3 as follows .",
    "@xmath95          in this section we introduce the notion of winner and loser , following the terminology of the paper of avila , gouzel and yoccoz  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath21 we define the _ type _ @xmath96 of @xmath10 by @xmath97 .",
    "we will then say that @xmath98 is the winner and @xmath99 is the loser .",

    "we now see how to compute the data of the new map .",
    "there are two cases to distinguish depending on whether @xmath10 is of type @xmath103 or @xmath72 ; the combinatorial data of @xmath30 only depends on @xmath3 and on the type of @xmath10 .",
    "this defines two maps @xmath104 and @xmath105 by @xmath106 , with @xmath96 the type of @xmath10 .    1 .",

    "thus we want the iterates of the rauzy - veech induction on @xmath10 to be always well defined .",
    "we also want this induction to be a good renormalization process , in the sense that the iterates correspond to inductions on subintervals that tend to zero .",

    "as we will see this situation is very similar in the case of linear involutions .    if we want to study the rauzy - veech induction as a dynamical system on the space of interval exchange maps , it is useful to consider the rauzy - veech renormalisation on the projective space of lengths parameters space .",
    "the natural associated object is the renormalized rauzy - veech induction defined on length one intervals : @xmath140      given a permutation @xmath3 , we can define two other permutations @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
