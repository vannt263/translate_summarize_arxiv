    "it is generally believed that the existence of a fundamental length is a natural feature in all theories that endeavor to answer the old and interesting question of how to quantize gravity @xcite . in string theory ,",
    "considered as an alternative to the unified theory of interactions , the fundamental length plays a crucial role @xcite .",
    "also , the fundamental length appears in loop quantum gravity @xcite as a promising alternative to quantum gravity , in the form of discrete spectra of the area and volume operators @xcite .",
    "this fundamental length is introduced by hand in some effective theories @xcite where it is shown that it can be recovered as the limit of full quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the motivation behind the construction of these effective models is to study the effects of such a fundamental length in simple scenarios which are amenable to exact solutions . a common approach to introduce a fundamental length",
    "is to modify or deform the algebraic structure of the phase - space which may be done in various manners , a few example of which can be found in @xcite .    to study the effects of the existence of a fundamental length on the behavior of the universe , one can construct a model based on the noncommutative structure of dsr @xcite which is described by what is known as the @xmath0-deformation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-deformation is introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-minkowski space @xcite arises from the @xmath0-poincare algebra @xcite such that the ordinary brackets between coordinates are replaced by @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the poison bracket and @xmath0 is the deformation ( noncommutative ) parameter which has the dimension of mass @xmath3 for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 @xcite such that @xmath0 and @xmath6 can be interpreted as dimensional parameters corresponding to a fundamental energy and length , respectively .",
    "this fundamental length can be identified with an invariant minimum length _",
    "e.g. _ , the planck length . in what follows ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the @xmath7 sector . in the next section we will study the phase - space structure of a de - sitter spacetime .",
    "the dsr inspired deformation in de - sitter spacetimes is introduced in section [ 3 ] .",
    "sections [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] deal with the interpretation of the results .",
    "let us start by briefly examine a simple de - sitter model @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lapse function and @xmath10 represents an open , flat or closed universe respectively .",
    "the einstein - hilbert lagrangian with cosmological constant @xmath11 becomes @xmath12 - 2\\lambda)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -6n^{-1}a\\dot{a}^2 + 6kna-2\\lambda na^3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 $ ] is the ricci scalar and in the second line the total derivative term has been ignored .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian , up to a sign , becomes @xmath14 here , we note that since the momentum conjugate to @xmath9 , @xmath15 , vanishes , the term @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a lagrange multiplier , must be added as a constraint to hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) , so that the dirac hamiltonian is @xmath18 the equations of motion with respect to the above hamiltonian become @xmath19 note that to satisfy the constraint @xmath20 at all times the secondary constraint @xmath21 must also be satisfied .",
    "a simple calculations leads to @xmath22 where we have fixed the gauge by taking @xmath23 , that is , we work in the comoving gauge .",
    "note that the other equations will be satisfied automatically if the above equation is satisfied . the solutions for non - vanishing @xmath11",
    "become @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the integration constant . for vanishing @xmath11 we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the integration constant and the solutions become meaningful only for @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in all the possible solutions",
    "the scale factor has a growing behavior without any limit , save for the trivial cases @xmath30 and @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the scale factor goes to infinity for large @xmath31 , either exponentially or linearly for non - vanishing and vanishing @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "it has long been argued that a deformation in phase - space can be seen as an alternative path to quantization .",
    "this argument is based on wigner quasi - distribution function and weyl correspondence between quantum - mechanical operators in hilbert space and ordinary c - number functions in phase - space , see for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the deformation in the usual phase - space structure is introduced by moyal brackets which are based on the moyal product @xcite .",
    "however , to introduce such deformations , it is more convenient to work with poisson brackets rather than moyal brackets .    from a cosmological point of view , models are built in a minisuper-(phase)-space .",
    "it is therefore safe to say that studying such a space in the presence of the deformations mentioned above can be interpreted as studying the quantum effects on cosmological solutions .",
    "one should note that in gravity and consequently in cosmology , the effects of quantization are woven into the existence of a fundamental length @xcite , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the question then arises as to what form of deformations in phase - space is appropriate for studying quantum effects in a cosmological model ?",
    "the modified structure of the geometry , that is , the noncommutative geometry @xcite , has become the basis from which similar modifications in phase - space have been inspired . in this approach ,",
    "the fields and their conjugate momenta play the role of the coordinate basis in noncommutative geometry @xcite . of course ,",
    "in doing so an effective model is constructed whose validity depends on its power of prediction .",
    "for example , if in a model field theory the fields are taken as noncommutative , as has been done in @xcite , the resulting effective theory predicts the same lorentz violation as a field theory in which the coordinates are considered as noncommutative @xcite . over the years , a large number of works on noncommutative fields @xcite have been inspired by noncommutative geometry model theories @xcite . as a further example",
    ", it is well known that string theory can be used to suggest a modification in the bracket structure of coordinates , also known as generalized uncertainty principe @xcite , which is used to modify the phase - space structure @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will examine a new kind of modification in phase - space inspired by relation ( [ kappa - nc ] ) , much the same as what has been done in @xcite . in what follows",
    "we introduce noncommutativity based on @xmath0-minkowskian space and study its consequences on the solutions discussed in the previous section .    to introduce noncommutativity we start from @xmath32 where one can interpret @xmath9 and @xmath33 , appearing as the coefficients of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in the same manner as @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively . for this reason we name this kind of phase - space , the @xmath0-minkowskian ( minisuper ) phase - space . for the primed variables",
    "then , hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) becomes @xmath38 where the ordinary poisson brackets are satisfied except for ( [ kappa - nc - filds ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce the new variables @xmath39 it can be easily checked that the above variables will satisfy ( [ kappa - nc - filds ] ) if the unprimed variables satisfy the ordinary poisson brackets .",
    "the term @xmath40 may be looked upon as a direct consequence of a phase - space deformation of relation ( [ kappa - nc - filds ] ) which , as has been suggested , could originate from string theory , noncommutative geometry and so on , see @xcite . with the above transformations hamiltonian ( [ primedhamiltonian ] ) changes to @xmath41 clearly , the momentum @xmath42 conjugate to @xmath9 does not appear in ( [ hamiltoniannc1 ] ) , _ i.e. _ it should be taken as the primary constraint .",
    "it can be checked by using legendre transformations that the conjugate momentum corresponding to @xmath9 , that is , @xmath15 , vanishes .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath43 must be added to hamiltonian ( [ hamiltoniannc1 ] ) , so that we find @xmath44 the equations of motion with respect to hamiltonian ( [ hamiltoniannc ] ) are @xmath45 again we restrict ourselves to the comoving gauge for which @xmath23 . combining the first and last equation we find @xmath46 which is compatible with other equations .",
    "note that this equation reduces to the commutative case ( [ 1equation ] ) when @xmath47 .",
    "the analytic solutions for this equation exist only for the special cases @xmath30 or @xmath28 . for @xmath30 , the solution of equation ( [ equationnc ] ) is complex @xmath48}{2\\sqrt{6\\ell}k^{\\frac{1}{4}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is an integration constant .",
    "real solutions are only obtained for @xmath28 or @xmath29 , that is @xmath50}{2\\sqrt{3\\ell}},\\hspace{1cm}k=-1,\\label{k=-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants .",
    "the scale factor for @xmath28 and @xmath30 , represented by equation ( [ k=0nc ] ) is a constant , similar to the commutative case .",
    "the solution for @xmath53 is interesting since its behavior at late times , @xmath54 , is completely different from that of the commutative case . here",
    ", the scale factor becomes constant , in contrast to the commutative case given by equation ( [ com.solutions1 ] ) where the scale factor grows linearly .",
    "for the observationally interesting case @xmath28 , the scale factor can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a constant of integration .",
    "this solution reduces to the commutative one given by equation ( [ com.solutions ] ) for @xmath57 .",
    "note that the above solution for @xmath54 becomes constant @xmath58 which is different from that of the commutative solution given by equation ( [ com.solutions ] ) .",
    "the general solution for the scale factor given by equation ( [ equationnc ] ) can not be obtained analytically .",
    "this equation may however be solved numerically , showing that these solutions follow the general behavior of the special solutions , namely , the scale factor becomes constant for @xmath59 in contrast to the commutative case .",
    "this behavior can be seen in figure 2 for different values of @xmath60 .",
    "the scale factor calculated in ( [ k=0 ] ) and its behavior are the main results of the present work .",
    "to describe these results we may interpret @xmath11 both as a cosmological constant for the present accelerating and the early inflationary phases of the universe . in what follows we study the implications of the fundamental length on the scale factor given by relation ( [ k=0 ] ) in these two distinct scenarios .",
    "the first scenario can be realized by noting that the main ingredients in these calculations have been the introduction of the above deformation to the ordinary poisson brackets which resulted in a damping exponential behavior in the evolution of the universe .",
    "however , in contrast to usual scenarios where @xmath61 , the scale factor asymptotically approaches a constant value at late times @xmath59 .",
    "it is clear from the plots in figure 1 that for @xmath61 the curve is concave in all regions . for @xmath62",
    "the curve is concave at first but becomes convex at late times and @xmath53 the scale factor ( [ k=-1 ] ) is convex in all regions . ] .",
    "this means that the deceleration parameter is negative at the beginning and becomes positive later dominated phase , respectively @xcite . here",
    ", our model is restricted to the @xmath11 dominated phase and shows that the existence of @xmath6 can change the acceleration to a deceleration phase . ] .",
    "note that the above results are a direct effect of the existence of a non - vanishing fundamental length @xmath6 ( noncommutativity parameter ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in studying the phenomenological aspects of quantum gravity @xcite one has to go to high energies to zoom in on very small distances where we expect the effects of quantum gravity to become dominant .",
    "however , the results presented here point to an alternative possibility for the observation of the fundamental length in that it is directly related to the possibility of the observation of a constant scale factor .",
    "the price to be paid however is that one has to wait , possibly , for an incredibly long time",
    ". this could be interpreted as the duality of time and energy , namely , either spending large amounts of energy to penetrate small distances in a short span of time or use little energy but face the possibility of having to endure the passage of a long interval of time . in this scenario ,",
    "the cosmos can be taken as a large laboratory in which the study of cosmological models can pave the way for a full understanding of quantum gravity .",
    "otherwise , `` an accelerator powerful enough to study ... planckian objects would have to be as large as the entire galaxy '' @xcite .    the solid line shows the scale factor for non - vanishing @xmath6 ( @xmath63 ) and the dashed line for vanishing @xmath6 .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath28 for both cases.,width=264 ]    ccc",
    "the second scenario stems from the observation of the general belief that the effects of a fundamental length or equivalently in this model , the noncommutative structure , can be observed in the early universe . it would therefore be interesting and natural to discuss the results of the present work at the early stages of the evolution of the universe",
    ". we will show below that this simple model may be useful in describing the early inflationary phase of the universe .",
    "let us then suppose that this phase begins at an initial time @xmath66 and ends at a final time @xmath67 , also known as the reheating time @xcite .",
    "during such a phase the problem of e - folding , that is , the order of magnitude of the size of the universe with which the scale factor expands during inflation and the length of this period , which should be finite , must be addressed whenever an inflationary model is discussed @xcite .",
    "the value of the e - folding according to the present data is at least @xmath68 which means that the scale factor of the inflationary phase must satisfy the relation @xmath69 . from equation ( [ k=0 ] ) , it is clear that at early stages , since @xmath70 , the scale factor behaves exponentially and @xmath11 is viewed as the cosmological constant of the inflationary era . as time passes ,",
    "the behavior of the scale factor would only depend on @xmath6 and clearly it would no longer follow the exponential growth that it once had .",
    "this means that the presence of @xmath6 could provide a natural mechanism with which to exit from the inflationary phase . to address the e - folding problem",
    "we note that one may introduce a relation between the inflationary cosmological constant @xmath11 and the fundamental length ( noncommutativity parameter ) @xmath6 using the above definition for e - folding , that is , @xmath71 which would clearly address the @xmath68 e - folding problem @xcite .",
    "we may now see that such a relatively simple model can address the above issues in inflationary models .",
    "note that the initial time can be chosen as zero @xcite , as has been done in the above calculations .",
    "it would be appropriate here to point out that there are other dsr - inspired theories for the inflationary era in the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "these theories essentially amount to an adaptation of the old varying speed of light idea to the more compelling logics of the dsr setup , for a comprehensive review see @xcite and the references therein . in these models ,",
    "the assumption of a varying speed of light is invoked to address the problems of the standard cosmology without resorting to the ubiquitous scalar field invariably referred to as the inflaton .",
    "the well known problems of the standard cosmology , namely the flatness , cosmological constant , homogeneity and isotropy have all a direct solution in such dsr - inspired models @xcite .",
    "an important feature of these models is the functional form of @xmath72 which , amongst other properties , should be able to account for the rapid expansion of the universe during the inflationary era . to this end , @xmath72 is so constructed as to predict an almost @xmath73 fold increase in the speed of light during inflation over its present value .",
    "in contrast , the model presented in this work has a deformation parameter , @xmath6 , which makes a  graceful exit \" from the inflationary era possible .",
    "the inflationary era itself is produced by the existence of a cosmological constant , @xmath11 . in summary , in our model the existence of a deformation , inspired by dsr , controls the rate of inflation .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that in a dsr - inspired frw model the scale factor shows an exponential ( inflationary ) behavior just after dust - domination as a consequence of the fundamental length .",
    "this latter model is more relevant to other dsr - inspired works @xcite since in these models the inflationary behavior appears just after the radiation - dominated era .",
    "more often than not , it is the case that the study of effective theories can shed light on the blurred corners of the corresponding full theory .",
    "the same is true in describing the quantum effects on cosmology since the full theory is immensely difficult to handle @xcite . the dsr can be interpreted as one such effective theory .",
    "therefore , the study of cosmological models within the framework of such effective theories could pave the way for a more profound understanding . in the present study ,",
    "we have introduced a fundamental length by employing an effective theory , namely a dsr - inspired model . in doing so",
    "we have chosen a simple cosmological model , namely a de - sitter spacetime . here , the introduction of a fundamental length causes additional terms to appear in hamiltonian ( [ hamiltoniannc ] ) as compared to ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "as has been mentioned in @xcite , these extra terms can be interpreted as the effects of high energy corrections of a full theory , e.g. , string theory in that the extra terms can be interpreted as quantum effects . ] .",
    "our results can also be used to address the problems of interest in cosmology such as the inflation or present accelerating phase , discussed above .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the modifications introduced in this work , based on relation ( [ kappa - nc - filds ] ) , are relevant in model theories dealing with the problems mentioned above .    in summary",
    ", we have studied a noncommutative model theory in which noncommutativity was inspired by invoking @xmath0-deformation in phase - space .",
    "the noncommutativity parameter appearing in our model was interpreted as a fundamental length .",
    "starting from a de - sitter universe , the effects of noncommutativity is either to predict a `` graceful exit '' from the inflationary phase or the emergence from a late time accelerating phase .",
    "these results can be interpreted as a phenomenological feature for the existence of such a length and indirectly for the existence of a quantum theory of gravity . + * acknowledgments * + we would like to thank m. m. sheikh - jabbari for useful discussions .",
    "we also thank m. bojowald for useful comments and s. sarkarati for his help in preparing the plots .",
