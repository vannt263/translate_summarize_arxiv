    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) consist of a low - mass star filling its roche lobe and transferring mass to its white - dwarf ( wd ) companion , a procedure resulting in the formation of an accretion disc . due to their unpredictability and diversity",
    "leading to various types of cvs , these stars are since long the subject of many studies .",
    "our aim is to better understand the properties of these systems by detecting periodicities and by analysing the various physical processes that occur , such as outbursts , superhumps , eclipses , flickering , etc .",
    "our data will be useful for studying these cvs in the future , when a system possibly is in a different brightness state . in this study",
    "we present time - resolved photometric data of nine poorly - studied cvs , dwarf novae ( dn ) and nova - likes ( nls ) in particular",
    ". a deeper study of five more cvs , was published by @xcite .",
    "during the period 20022005 we conducted observations of several targets at five different observatories : the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , the observatorium hoher list in germany ( ohl ) , uccle observatory ( uc ) in belgium and two observatories in greece : kryoneri ( kr ) and skinakas ( sk ) . at the saao we used the 1-m telescope equipped with a back - illuminated @xmath0 , 24-micron pixel ste4 ccd camera with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath1 . at the ohl",
    ", we used the 1-m cassegrain - nasmyth telescope with the @xmath2 , 15-micron pixel holicam ccd camera with a 2-sided read - out .",
    "we used the focal reducer and an effective fov of @xmath3 . at uc we used the 0.85-m schmidt telescope with a @xmath2 , 9-micron pixel princeton instruments te cdd camera with a @xmath4 fov restricted to an effective fov of @xmath5 on average . at kr the 1.2-m cassegrain telescope with a @xmath6 24-micron pixel ccd camera and a @xmath7 fov",
    "finally , we performed observations with the 1.3-m ritchey - chrtien telescope at sk , giving a fov of @xmath8 and used the 1024x1024 pixel site ccd camera .",
    "while most of the observations were unfiltered , the johnson-@xmath9 filter was occasionally used at sk .",
    "table  [ t_log_all ] gives the complete observing log for our 9 targets .",
    "whenever a filter was used it is indicated as a superscript in the ut date .",
    "the heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) at the beginning of each observing run as well as the total duration in hours , are also given .",

    "we also searched for long - term periodicities , but none was evident .",
    "the same applies for qpos , where none was convincing enough to be adopted .",
    "the amount of flickering was found to be 0.117@xmath120.034mag .",
    "as previously mentioned , v1315 aql undergoes eclipses of around 1.8mag in @xmath13 . in our case",
    "the eclipse depth is found around 3.2 and 2.6mag in the unfiltered 2003 and @xmath9-band 2004 runs , respectively .",
    "the only exception is the eclipse depth of the unfiltered night of @xmath14 of august 2004 . here",
    "the eclipse depth is remarkably smaller at 1.5mag , half and less than half of the rest of the nights . in fig .",
    "[ f_ecl ] the out - of - eclipse magnitude has been shifted to zero and the variable eclipse depth is readily estimated .",
    "variable eclipse depth has also been reported for dw uma @xcite and px and @xcite . in dw uma",
    "it was attributed to the change between high and low state of the accretion disc radius and therefore the surface of the eclipsed accretion disc . however , in our study the unique low - depth eclipse makes it hard to investigate further and try to draw firm conclusions . even if we tried to associate the eclipse depth with the system luminosity we can directly see that between the two extreme nights of 15 august 2003 and 22 august 2004 where the eclipse depth is @xmath15 1.5 and 3.2mag , the out - of - eclipse magnitude is the same ( see fig .",
    "[ f_lc_v1315 ] ) . in px and the eclipse - depth",
    "was suggested to be modulated with the precession period of the accretion disc .",
    "however , in the case of v1315  aql no longer - term modulation has been suggested so far .",
    "ln uma ( uma7 , pg 1000 + 667 ) was discovered in the palomar - green survey @xcite and , based on its spectral characteristics , was classified as a nl cv @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a period of 4.06h .",
    "however , the spectrophotometric study of @xcite revealed a refined @xmath16 of 3.47h through h@xmath17 radial velocities .",
    "their multi - year photometry ( 1400 days covering 1 point every 4.7 days ) showed two drops of 3 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "given the @xmath16 and the low states , ln uma was identified as a vy scl star . not much later , a spectroscopic search for new sw sex stars revealed that ln uma is also part of this interesting subclass of cvs @xcite .",
    "our dataset consists of five observing runs , three at sk and two at uc . at sk we observed using the johnson-@xmath9 filter while the uc run was unfiltered .",
    "the exposure time varied between 60 and 80sec .",
    "the light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ f_lc_uma7 ] .    after checking the long - term light curves of our system from aavso",
    "it is clear that the uc run is placed during the normal high state , but this is not evident for the sk run .",
    "however , the trend of the aavso light curves points to the normal high state for the sk run as well . as seen in fig .",
    "[ f_lc_uma7 ] , the atmospheric conditions for the sk run are much better than the uc one , with the error being greater in the uc run .",
    "this affects the flickering of ln uma which is found 0.0554mag for the uc and 0.0218mag for the sk run .",
    "the last value is the one that should be trusted .",
    "period analysis to all of our dataset as well as the individual runs did not reveal the spectroscopic @xmath11 or any other modulations .",
    "the high amplitude flickering of the longest run , covering more than two orbits , could easily mask any underlying periodicity .",
    "however , a possible qpo resolving into 2 components was found in the uc and sk run , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_qpo_uma7 ] . in the uc run",
    "it is found around 22min , while in the sk run around 15min .",
    "the sampling of the light curves was such that we could not reach frequencies higher than 345@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , no fits of the linear parts were made because we could be driven to inaccurate values of @xmath19 .",
    "the results of this study can be summarised as follows :    ei uma : :    for the first time we confirm through photometry the spectroscopic    @xmath11 of 6.4h .",
    "its rather low amplitude of    0.021@xmath120.002mag made its direct detection in 2002 more    difficult and was probably the reason for its non - detection so far .",
    "moreover , in 2002 the system exhibits a gradual increase in brightness    reaching a maximum of 0.6mag and a high amplitude unstable modulation .",
    "the increase in brightness is followed by a decrease in the amount of    flickering .",
    "v844 her : :    the spectroscopically defined @xmath11 could not be    detected .",
    "the same applies for the @xmath20 but this    was expected since the system was in quiescence .",
    "unluckily , aavso    long - term light curves confirm that our two observing run lie just    before the onset and just after the end of a superoutburst .",
    "v751 cyg : :    we have detected the two previously reported photometric signals    @xmath21 and @xmath22 , albeit only    their aliases and harmonics in some cases .",
    "@xcite reported a possible    qpo at @xmath23min and we have confirmed it at    @xmath1518min .",
    "this qpo was present at the ohl run but    not at the kr one .",
    "in contrast to @xcite who found    @xmath24 we found it at 1.29@xmath120.02 which    implies that the flickering activity has changed and in our case the    shot - noise follows some kind of distribution .",
    "v516 cyg : :    the system was observed at the peak of an outburst and during its    decline , until it reached its quiescent state . between the two extreme    states a magnitude difference of 2.5mag was observed .",
    "no dominant    periodicity could be detected .",
    "the decrease in brightness was followed    by an increase in flickering activity , expected since the accretion    disc returns to its normal smaller size and the relative contribution    of the bs , major cause of the flickering activity , increases .",
    "gz cnc : :    no periodicity could be detected during one of the system s frequent    outbursts .",
    "the only possible modulation is one of 3.7h .",
    "however , the    unsatisfying folding of our data on this modulation as well as the    fact that it exceeds the duration of our longest observing night , does    not add any credit .",
    "ty psc : :    this system was observed during quiescence and during the initiation    of decline from the peak of an outburst.we detected the    @xmath11 during quiescence but not in outburst",
    ". the    amount of flickering decreased with increasing brightness .",
    "asas j002511 + 1217.12 : :    our results resemble those of @xcite which were also obtained after    the echo outburst .",
    "the light curves exhibit high amplitude flickering    and show two possible signals : at 13.42@xmath25    and an alias of the superhump modulation .",
    "v1315 aql : :    our observations covered nine more eclipses which combined with the    previously reported mid - eclipse timings provide a refined orbital    ephemeris .",
    "the @xmath26 shows that during the 20-year    baseline there is no trend or curvature and therefore no change in the    system s period .",
    "the eclipse depth varies between 2.6 and 3.2mag with    the exception of one night where it has a remarkably smaller value of    1.5mag . for the moment",
    "no association between the brightness level and    the eclipse depth can be made because the two nights with the extreme    values of the eclipse depth ( 1.5 and 3.2mag ) share the same    out - of - eclipse magnitude .",
    "ln uma : :    our observing set is probably placed during the system s normal high    state and does not reveal the spectroscopic @xmath11    or any other modulation .",
    "the only exception is a possible qpo around    22min in the uc run and around 15min in the sk run . in both cases",
    "it    resolves into 2 components .",
