    "understanding the relative importance of nature and nurture remains a key issue in extra - galactic astrophysics .",
    "these factors control the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the dynamical structure or morphology of the galaxy . in isolated galaxies ,",
    "these observational quantities are largely determined by feedback processes acting within the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy adjoined to its assembly history via mergers . in the harsh cluster environment ,",
    "star formation activity in infalling spiral galaxies can be both enhanced through collisions @xcite or quenched by various physical mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping , harassment or starvation which transform them into the passive lenticulars which dominate the dense cluster cores ( for reviews see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and morphology  density @xcite relations .",
    "however , the dominant evolutionary pathway(s ) which generate these relationships remain uncertain .",
    "moreover , it remains unclear whether these two relations are driven by the same process , by independent processes acting on diverse time - scales , or if one effectively drives the other .",
    "while some of the diminution in star - formation seen in cluster galaxies with respect to the field population could be attributed to the different morphological compositions of the two environments , even at fixed morphology , the star - formation rate of cluster galaxies is found to be lower than in the field @xcite , indicating separate processes at least partially shape these relations .    alternatively , @xcite suggest that it is the morphological transformation of spirals into s0s and the growth of the stellar bulge which drives the quenching of star - formation in lenticulars by making the gas disk more stable against collapse and fragmentation into star - forming clumps , without requiring gas consumption or removal .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the trend for the molecular gas consumption time - scale to increase systematically with galaxy concentration index ( @xmath6 ) , recently observed by @xcite .",
    "this quenching itself is not related to the environment of the galaxy , and so can not alone explain the sfr ",
    "density relation , instead requiring some additional environmental process(es ) capable of producing the prior morphological transformation of the galaxies , such as the impact of cluster tidal fields @xcite , or pre - processing within infalling groups @xcite .    infalling",
    "spirals in local clusters show evidence for the ongoing removal of gas via ram - pressure stripping @xcite , leading to a rapid termination of star - formation from the outside - in , and subsequent fading of the disk component .",
    "however , s0s are found to differ from normal spirals due to higher bulge luminosities rather than fainter disks @xcite , requiring bulge growth during s0 formation , disfavouring ram - pressure stripping or starvation models .",
    "instead the increased scatters seen in cluster s0 and spiral tully - fisher relations support mechanisms that kinematically disturb infalling spirals , such as merging or harassment @xcite .",
    "such tidal interactions are capable of channelling material to a central bulge sufficient to produce the higher central mass densities ( @xmath7 ) seen in cluster spirals @xcite and ultimately the central surface brightnesses and stellar phase densities found in s0s .",
    "a number of studies have attempted to distinguish among the various environmental processes by identifying and classifying various promising classes of transition galaxies , such as post - starburst and/or e+a galaxies @xcite , interaction - induced starbursts @xcite , and passive / red spirals @xcite , indicating that more than one mechanism is required .    a key diagnostic to understand the relevance of these proposed transition galaxies is mid - infrared ( mir ) data to account for the dust - obscured star formation .",
    "many `` post - starburst '' galaxies identified by their deep h@xmath8 absorption lines and lack of oii emission were revealed by mid - infrared data to be dusty starbursts @xcite , whose age - dependant dust obscuration preferentially hides the young stars responsible for the oii emission above those older stars responsible for the balmer absorption @xcite .",
    "these spectroscopic and mir surveys revealed a ubiquitous population of starburst and post - starburst @xmath4 spirals in @xmath9 clusters @xcite , which are absent in present epoch clusters @xcite .",
    "they have been identified as the likely progenitors of present day cluster s0s , whose populations have risen dramatically over the last 5gyr , empirically replacing the spirals @xcite .",
    "additionally , interaction - induced starbursts are often highly obscured @xcite , while many red sequence galaxies ( including spirals ) have been revealed to be actively star - forming , their red colours being attributed to dust obscuration rather than being passively - evolving @xcite .",
    "most previous studies of environmental effects on galaxies have concentrated on their impact on morphology and star formation .",
    "however , given that the environmental processes behind the sf  density relation are likely to act _ directly _ on the ism rather than the star forming regions themselves , to fully understand the origin of the sf - density relation requires also measures of these impacts of environment on the ism which subsequently drive it . to date , a detailed knowledge of the impact of environment on the ism and dust content , and how this drives the sfr  density relation is still largely lacking .",
    "the most accessible probe of the ism in distant galaxies is via far - infrared observations of the thermal emission from their dust contents . using early _ iras _ @xcite and sub - mm observations @xcite modelled the origin of the far - infrared emission in terms of two main components ( ignoring pahs here ) : a warm component of small dust grains in hii regions heated by star formation ; and a cool cirrus component of large dust grains heated by the interstellar radiation field .",
    "@xcite estimated that this cool , cirrus component contributes as much as 5070 per cent of the far - ir flux , while @xcite revealed a strong morphological trend , with a decreasing cirrus contribution from @xmath10 per cent for sa galaxies to just 3 per cent for sdm galaxies . the unprecedented wavelength coverage and sensitivity of _",
    "herschel _ @xcite allows us to extend these analyses to large samples of galaxies .",
    "@xcite demonstrate the requirement of a two - component dust model to fit the 24500@xmath0 m spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of m33 , comprising a hot component ( @xmath110k ) tracing star - formation and a dominant cold component of large dust grains heated by the general interstellar radiation field .",
    "this second component can in effect measure the fuel available for star formation , and a comparison of the two components allows us to measure the star - formation efficiency , or gas consumption time - scale .    using _ iras",
    "_ , @xcite found that hi - deficient galaxies in the virgo cluster had lower 60 and 100@xmath0 m fluxes , and cooler far - infrared colours than those with normal hi content .",
    "they interpreted this as evidence for the same two - component model for the far - infrared emission . in the cluster environment , the warm star - formation component",
    "is diminished in proportion to the hi deficiency suggesting that star - formation is regulated by the amount of available gas , while the cool component from diffuse dust is reduced by a smaller factor as dust is stripped from the galaxy .",

    "[ spectra ] or those covered by ifu spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "moreover , the optical and nebular emission suggested by the blue curves is an artifact of the models , which connect implicitly the dust heating process to hii regions , producing nebular emission as a consequence of the ionizing uv radiation ( heavily extincted ) required to heat the dust sufficiently to produce the observed far - infrared emission . given the clear lack of observed uv or nebular emission , the origin of the uv / optical radiation required to heat the dust component remains unclear .",
    "the emission from hii regions is instead only detectable in the mid / far - infrared , demonstrating the importance of such data for fully understanding the processes which drive and quench star formation in galaxies .",

    "one caveat is that _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) observations of early - type galaxies have revealed diffuse , excess emission over 1030@xmath0 m , due to silicate emission from the dusty circumstellar envelopes of mass - losing asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite , which persists even for the very evolved stellar populations beyond 10gyr old @xcite . while this component is not included in our models , and could in principle explain the 24@xmath0 m fluxes , its emission should then decline rapidly beyond 30@xmath0 m , and hence could in no way contribute significantly to the thermal emission detected at 70@xmath0 m .",

    "given the rather diverse properties of these 3 galaxies with respect to all of the others , and the likelihood that many similar low - mass galaxies would be missed by our 70@xmath0 m survey , it is difficult to assess the importance or relation of these galaxies with respect to the rest of the population .",
    "as well as providing a robust constraint for the level of star formation within hii regions , the mid - infrared emission constrains the intensity of the radiation heating the dust , via the compactness parameter , @xmath85 , which is of the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 describe the time evolution of the stellar luminosities and radii of the hii regions @xcite . hence @xmath85 provides a measure of the density of radiation within hii regions available for heating the dust . as is shown in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite , the primary effect of varying @xmath85 is to change the temperature of the dust , and systematically shift the wavelength of the far - infrared dust emission . as the compactness parameter decreases from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , the peak wavelength of the far - infrared emission moves to progressively longer wavelengths from 50@xmath0 m to 130@xmath0 m , i.e. the dust temperature drops from @xmath110k to @xmath910k .",
    "the constraint on the compactness parameter for our galaxies comes from their @xmath2 colours , which can only be modelled by an extremely low compactness parameter @xmath92 .",
    "such a low @xmath85 value produces dust temperatures and far - infrared seds similar to those produced by a radiation field of intensity 11@xmath93 the local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , similar to that modelled for ngc5866 @xcite .",

    "this view that the anomalous @xmath2 colours require very low values of the compactness parameter @xmath85 is consistent with the model predictions of @xcite who show that the characteristics of the dust emission as observed by the @xmath2 colour are strongly linked to the surface density of star formation within a star - forming region ( @xmath96sfr / m@xmath97 ) , independent of metallicity ( their fig .",

    "the 23@xmath5 increase in @xmath2 required to produce our 70@xmath0m - excess galaxies from the normal star - forming population implies a reduction in @xmath96sfr of @xmath9801@xmath99 .",
    "similarly , @xcite shows that the integrated @xmath2 colours of normal star - forming galaxies ( lirgs excluded ) are tightly anti - correlated with the star formation surface density ( their fig .",
    "17 ) , while @xcite show that the mid - infrared colours mainly depend on the ratio between the diffuse component from the ism ( heated by both young and old stars ) and the clumpy component from the hii regions ( the f factor in their formulation ) . in this latter work ,",
    "the largest @xmath2 ratios are produced by a diffuse component heated only by evolved stars without a significant additional clumpy component .",
    "we note at this point that there are clear limitations on our ability to model and constrain the far - infrared emission of these galaxies .",
    "firstly , given that we have just two data points ( 24@xmath0 m and 70@xmath0 m ) , we can only reasonably fit the far - infrared emission by a single - component model with one free parameter , @xmath85 .",
    "this means that we can not consider more complex or realistic models which are able to fit separately the diffuse cool dust component related to the general interstellar medium and the hotter , clumpy component linked to star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the lack of coverage beyond 70@xmath0 m means that we are not mapping the peak of the far - infrared emission from large dust grains , and so can not constrain either the temperature or mass of the cool , diffuse dust component .",
    "in particular , we can not distinguish between models in which the excess 70@xmath0 m emission is due to an increase in the mass of the cold , diffuse dust component , or rather an increase in its temperature .",
    "while our mid - infrared observations are sufficient to show that the infrared ( @xmath4301000@xmath0 m ) emission comes primarily from a cool diffuse component , further observations in at least one passband at @xmath9100500@xmath0 m to map the rayleigh - jeans tail of the far - infrared emission are required to constrain the nature of this diffuse component , in a manner similar to that already achieved using _ herschel _ pacs / spire observations in five far - infrared bands over 70500@xmath0 m ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite resolved the molecular gas for 12 sauron galaxies into central disks or rings , coincident with the dust distribution ( often in the form of tightly - wound spiral structures ) and corrotating with the ionized gas . however , star formation is the ionisation source for just half of the sample , corresponding to those with the largest molecular gas reservoirs .",

    "radio relation , having excess fir flux , while the bolometric ir flux produces sfr estimates @xmath15 times higher than those based on the 8@xmath0 m or 24@xmath0 m fluxes , due to additional heating from evolved stars in the bulge .",
    "interestingly , one galaxy from their sample , ngc4526 an s0 belonging to the virgo cluster , is also a 70@xmath0m - excess galaxy with @xmath134 , supporting the hypothesis that these are a cluster population . of the 225 mostly field",

    "[ optmir ] and all along the quenching sequence of fig .  [ quenching ] , appears to point towards a morphological scenario in which spirals are first transformed into s0s without necessarily affecting their star - formation , before being quenched morphologically .",
    "this however , does nt explain why these transition dusty s0s with litte or no star formation are located almost exclusively in the dense cluster cores and appear so rare in isolated field regions .",
    "in contrast the ram - pressure stripping scenario is able naturally to explain their concentration in the cluster cores where the dense icm and high infall velocities make ram - pressure stripping most efficient .",
    "it does nt however explain why these galaxies have already been morphologically transformed from spirals to s0s , as ram - pressure stripping is not predicted to strongly affect a galaxy s morphology .",
    "instead , we would expect to find large numbers of spirals with little or no star - formation , which judging by fig .",
    "[ quenching ] is nt the case .",
    "however we note that galaxies for which star - formation has been largely or completely quenched would not likely be detected at 70@xmath0 m and hence are nt included in the figure .      to accurately account for the quenched galaxy population , and to be able to determine if indeed star - formation",

    "[ optmir_morph ] the infrared colour @xmath24 versus @xmath22-band magnitude of confirmed shapley supercluster galaxies , colour - coded according to their morphological classifications , allowing us to directly relate the bimodality in the star - formation activity to morphology .",
    "as we would expect , the passive galaxies ( @xmath138 ) are predominately early - types ( e , e / s0,s0 ) , while the normal star - forming galaxies ( @xmath139 ) are mostly spirals ( sa or later ) .",
    "there are however notable populations of both passive spirals and star - forming s0s .",
    "looking first at the 277 passive galaxies with @xmath140 , we find that @xmath141 per cent are classified as spirals ( 27 sa , 1 sg ) .",
    "these examples of massive spirals with low sfrs are reminiscent of the classic `` anemic spiral '' of @xcite , although all show also a prominent bulge . this would be consistent with @xcite who show that truly quenched central galaxies ( i.e. most massive galaxies within their host dm halo ) have stellar bulges , indicating that a bulge , is an absolute requirement for full quenching of star formation ( at least in central galaxies ) .",
    "for these passive spirals certainly ram - pressure stripping is a suitable candidate for removing their gas and quenching star - formation , in a manner similar to those spirals with truncated h@xmath32-disks and/or hi tails found in virgo @xcite .",
    "conversely , considering the 77 @xmath140 star - forming galaxies , @xmath142 per cent are classified as early types ( 2 s0/s , 10 s0 , 1 e / s0 , 1 e ) , for which it seems the morphological transformation has occured _ prior _ to any significant quenching of star - formation .",
    "this time sequence is the opposite of what has been suggested by previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which typically use optical colour as a proxy for star - formation activity .",
    "however , using _ spitzer _",
    "mid - infrared data @xcite revealed that these optically passive spirals still had significant obscured star formation , albeit at levels 0.6dex lower on average than normal star - forming galaxies of the same mass .",
    "they suggested that these apparent contraditions between the optical and mid - infrared viewpoints reflected that the unobscured star - formation in the outer disk is the most susceptible to quenching by ram - pressure stripping , while the obscured component in the central parts remains relatively unaffected .    that there are comparable fractions and numbers of passive spirals and star - forming early - types indicates that star - formation in cluster galaxies is being quenched _ both _ before _ and _ after morphological transformation from spiral to s0 .",
    "this is confirmed if we look at the morphologies of the transition galaxies with @xmath143 likely to be in the process of having their star formation quenched .",
    "here we find that @xmath144 per cent of the 74 @xmath140 transition galaxies are spirals ( 26 sa , 2 sb , 3 sg ) , and @xmath145 per cent are early - types ( 29 s0 , 2 s0-s , 6 e / s0 , 6 e ) . among this latter population ,",
    "many have excess 70@xmath0 m emission , producing mid - infrared colours inconsistent with those seen in the local field population or by model infrared seds .    the concentration of these transitional s0s with excess 70@xmath0 m emission towards the cluster cores points towards ram - pressure stripping being as the mechanism quenching the star formation in these galaxies .",
    "however , assuming the simple @xcite criterion the high central stellar densities of these s0s should significantly reduce the ability of ram - pressure stripping to completely remove their gas , while at low redshifts stellar mass loss should be capable of replenishing the gas supply requried to maintain observed low levels of star formation . as the findings of @xcite show ,",
    "a significant fraction of s0s are able to retain their molecular gas for several gyr within the dense icm of the virgo cluster .",
    "the apparent `` virialized '' dynamical status of the 70@xmath0m - excess population , suggests that these have also resided within the icm for some time , rather than observed on their first infall .",
    "if this is the case , then it seems plausible that these are the direct descendants of the dusty starburst and post - starburst @xmath4 galaxies abundant in clusters at @xmath146 @xcite , but which appear rare in present day clusters .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the mid - infrared colours of 165 70@xmath0m - detected spectroscopic members of the shapley supercluster core at @xmath1 , using panoramic _ spitzer_/mips 24@xmath0 m and 70@xmath0 m data .",
    "while the bulk of galaxies show mid - infrared colours typical of local star - forming galaxies , we identified a significant population of 23 `` 70@xmath0m - excess '' galaxies , comprising @xmath37 per cent of 70@xmath0m - detected ssc galaxies , whose mid - infrared colours @xmath114 are much cooler than can be reproduced by any of the standard infrared sed models .",
    "we examined in detail the nature of these galaxies , finding the following :    * they are strongly concentrated towards the cores ( @xmath147 ) of the five clusters that make up the ssc , and also appear extremely rare among local field galaxies from the sings and swire surveys , confirming them as a cluster - specific phenomenon . * their intermediate @xmath24 ratios",
    "place them in transition zone in which galaxies in the process of having their star formation quenched are likely to be located . *",
    "their optical spectra and lack of significant ultraviolet emission imply little or no ongoing star formation .",
    "* they are primarily massive @xmath115 galaxies with e / s0 morphologies , as confirmed by subsequent bulge - disk decompositions requiring comparable bulge and disk components to fit their @xmath21-band surface brightness profiles .",
    "* fits to their panchromatic seds require their far - infrared emission to be produced mostly by the diffuse dust component heated by the general interstellar radiation field rather than the clumpy component related to ongoing star formation .",
    "given that for most of these galaxies there is no evidence of ongoing or recent star formation , the origin of this dust heating mechanism remains unclear .",
    "the joint analyses of the infrared colours and morphologies reveal that a primary evolutionary pathway for the formation of passive s0s in cluster cores involves the _ prior _ morphological transformation of spirals into s0s , perhaps via pre - processing or the impact of cluster tidal fields , before a subsequent quenching of star formation once the s0 encounters the dense environment of the cluster core .",
    "many of the cluster s0s in this latter stage of transformation , that is in the process of having their star formation quenched , are characterised by excess 70@xmath0 m emission , indicating that their cold dust contents are probably declining at a slower rate than their star formation .",
    "this observation , their concentration within the cluster cores , and their apparent virialized dynamical status , draw strong parallels with the population of molecular gas - rich s0s identified by @xcite in the virgo cluster .",
    "these results suggest then that s0s are able to retain both their molecular gas and dust contents for a significant length of time ( @xmath148gyr ) within the icm , after being accreted by a cluster .",
    "these thus represent a key transition population that can be used to understand the physical mechanisms behind the formation of many passive lenticulars in local clusters .",
    "we put forward two possible causes for these cluster s0s with excess 70@xmath0 m emission : ( i ) assuming the dust - to - gas ratio remains constant , the 70@xmath0 m excess suggests a reduction in the star - formation efficiency in these dusty cluster s0s as proposed within the morphological quenching scenario ; or ( ii ) a 23@xmath5 increase in the dust - to - gas ratio or metallicity of the remnant ism of these galaxies , as predicted by multizone chemical evolutionary models of galaxies in the process of being ram - pressure stripped or starved . in this latter scenario ,",
    "the accretion of pristine gas is shut down , and so no longer dilutes the remaining hi gas enriched by metals recycled by stellar mass loss .",
    "this evolutionary pathway is quite different from the often considered view that star formation is quenched in spiral galaxies once they encounter the cluster environment , forming the classic anemic spiral population @xcite , which are then transformed somehow into lenticulars .",
    "notably , we identify significant populations of both star - forming s0s and passive spirals which reveal that star - formation in cluster galaxies is being quenched both _ before _ and _ after _ morphological transformation from spiral to lenticular , and that both pathways are of comparable relevance .",
    "this was confirmed when we looked at the transition galaxies likely to be in the process of having their star formation quenched , finding them to made up of 42 per cent spirals ( mostly sa ) and 58 per cent early - type galaxies , most of which were s0s .",
    "these results confirm that the environmental processes behind the sfr  density and morphology  density relations are complex and are far from being fully understood .",
    "the availability of far - infared data is allowing us now to probe directly the interstellar medium via its dust content , which given that the environmental processes behind the quenching of star formation in cluster galaxies are likely to act directly on the ism rather than the star forming regions themselves , will be crucial in fully understanding the origin of the sf  density relation .",

    "<S> while the bulk of galaxies show @xmath2 colours typical of local star - forming galaxies , we identify a significant sub - population of 23 70@xmath0m - excess galaxies , whose mir colours ( @xmath3 ) are much redder and can not be reproduced by any of the standard model infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies are found to be strongly concentrated towards the cores of the five clusters that make up the ssc , and also appear rare among local field galaxies , confirming them as a cluster - specific phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> their optical spectra and lack of significant ultraviolet emission imply little or no ongoing star formation , while fits to their panchromatic seds require the far - infrared emission to come mostly from a diffuse dust component heated by the general interstellar radiation field rather than ongoing star formation . </S>",
    "<S> most of these 70@xmath0m - excess galaxies are identified as @xmath4 s0s with smooth profiles .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that almost every cluster galaxy in the process of star - formation quenching is already either an s0 or sa , while we find no passive galaxies of class sb or later . </S>",
    "<S> hence the formation of passive early - type galaxies in cluster cores must involve the _ prior _ morphological transformation of late - type spirals into sa / s0s , perhaps via pre - processing or the impact of cluster tidal fields , before a _ </S>",
    "<S> subsequent _ quenching of star formation once the lenticular encounters the dense environment of the cluster core . in the cases of many cluster s0s , </S>",
    "<S> this phase of star - formation quenching is characterised by an excess of 70@xmath0 m emission , indicating that the cold dust content is declining at a _ slower _ rate than star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the excess 70@xmath0 m emission during quenching is due to either : ( i ) a reduction of the star - formation efficiency as proposed within the morphological quenching scenario ; or ( ii ) a 23@xmath5 increase in the dust - to - gas ratio or metallicity of the remaining interstellar medium , as predicted by chemical evolutionary models of galaxies undergoing ram - pressure stripping or starvation .    </S>",
