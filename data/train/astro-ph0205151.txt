    "although elliptical and s0 galaxies are dominated by an old stellar population with few or no young stars , it has been known for more than forty years that they contain observable amounts of interstellar gas at @xmath13727 , and h@xmath2 which is probably present whenever 3727 occurs .",
    "most e galaxies show this emission . ''",
    "( sandage 1961 ) . ] . over the past decade",
    "it has become clear that elliptical galaxies have a complex , multiphase interstellar medium which may contain hot ( x  ray ) , warm ( ionized ) and cool ( hi , co ) components .",
    "the nature of the ism in an individual elliptical galaxy provides us with important clues to its kinematic , environmental and chemical history over the past few gigayears , but the cold gas component is in many ways the most difficult to detect and study .",
    "we present some early results from the hi parkes all  sky survey ( hipass ) , and also discuss the hi structures , kinematics and star  formation history of some individual elliptical galaxies .",
    "although searches for hi in individual ellipticals have been carried out since the 1970s ( e.g. gallagher 1972 ; bottinelli , gougenheim & heidmann 1973 , shostak , roberts & peterson 1975 , knapp et al .",
    "1977 ) , the first systematic attempts to determine the hi properties of elliptical galaxies as a class were made by sanders ( 1980 ) and knapp , turner & cunniffe ( 1985 ) .    based on a sample of 46 elliptical galaxies ,",
    "9 of which were detected in hi , sanders ( 1980 ) suggested that the hi content of ellipticals was bimodal , with about 30% ` gas  rich ' ( m@xmath3/l@xmath4 ) and 70% ` gas - free ' ( m@xmath3/l@xmath5 ) .",
    "knapp et al . ( 1985 ) analysed a larger sample of 152 hi observations of e galaxies from the literature , of which 23 ( 15% ) were detected in hi .",
    "they found a very broad distribution in m@xmath3/l@xmath6 in ellipticals .",
    "this contrasted strongly with the distribution of m@xmath3/l@xmath6 in spiral galaxies , which has a well  defined mean value and a small dispersion .",
    "knapp et al .  concluded that , because of this decoupling of the stellar and gas content of elliptical galaxies , the gas must have an external origin and was probably acquired in an interaction or merger with a gas  rich galaxy .",
    "two years later , jura et al .  ( 1987 ) found that more than 50% of nearby elliptical galaxies in the revised shapley ames catalog ( rsa ; sandage & tammann 1981 ) were detected as far  infrared sources at 100@xmath7 m , implying typical dust masses of 10@xmath810@xmath9 m@xmath10 and hi masses of 10@xmath1110@xmath12 m@xmath10 ( i.e. lower than could generally be detected with current radio telescopes ) .",
    "they concluded that the presence of cold gas in elliptical galaxies is `` the rule rather than the exception '' .",
    "however , although modest amounts of cold gas appear to be common in elliptical galaxies , hi observations of these galaxies remain challenging because the hi mass is usually small ( though some e / s0 galaxies like ngc5266 are as gas  rich as a late  type spiral ; morganti et al .",
    "1997 ) and the profile smeared out by high velocities ( because these are massive galaxies ) . as a result ,",
    "the detection rate in targeted hi surveys of nearby elliptical galaxies is low and observers have tended to focus their attention on ` peculiar ' ellipticals ( i.e. those with shells , dust lanes or other signs of recent interaction ) where the probability of detecting hi is higher ( bregman , hogg & roberts ( 1992 ) found that only 5% of normal rsa ellipticals were detected in hi , compared to 45% of peculiar e / s0 galaxies ) . as a result ,",
    "the hi data available in the literature for elliptical galaxies is still sparse and inhomogeneous .",
    "there are many questions we would like to answer .",
    "what is the hi mass function for elliptical and s0 galaxies ?",
    "how does the typical hi content of an early  type galaxy vary with environment ?",
    "do all the hi gas disks in ellipticals come from mergers , or are some primordial ?",
    "to make progress , we need a large and homogeneous set of hi data for early  type galaxies , and the hipass survey makes this possible for the first time .",
    "the hipass survey ( barnes et al .",
    "2001 ) covered the entire southern sky using a 13beam receiver at the prime focus of the 64 m parkes radio telescope . an earlier paper ( sadler 2001 ) describes hipass results for a sample of about 2500 e and s0 galaxies from the rc3 galaxy catalogue ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the final hipass detection rate is roughly 6% for rc3 ellipticals and",
    "13% for s0s , to a flux limit of 2.6jykms@xmath13 , and figure 1 shows the corresponding hi mass limits for detections which were unconfused ( i.e. there was only one optical galaxy in the 15arcmin parkes beam .",
    "however for 3050% of early  type galaxies where hipass detected hi , there was more than one galaxy of similar optical velocity in the parkes beam . here , observations at higher spatial resolution are needed to determine the hi mass associated with each galaxy , and a program of follow  up observations is currently underway at the australia telescope compact array .",
    "once the confused galaxies are sorted out , we will be able to calculate the local hi mass function for both elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "there are several reasons for studying the detailed morphology and kinematics of hi in individual e / s0 galaxies . settled hi disks , though rare ,",
    "are a powerful tracer of the mass distribution in the outer regions ( e.g. franx , van gorkom & de zeeuw , 1994 ) , and the presence of large amounts of hi may indicate that the galaxy has been involved in a recent interaction or merger .",
    "the results presented here are part of a long  term project to obtain good  quality hi images for a sample of 2030 southern elliptical galaxies , and to use them both for dynamical studies and to investigate the links between galaxy interactions and agn fuelling .",
    "the galaxies we have studied so far fall into three main classes : galaxies with settled hi disks , galaxies with central star formation , and galaxies with disturbed hi and tidal tails .",
    "many of the elliptical galaxies we observed have their hi in settled , rotating disks which can be used as mass tracers .",
    "figure 2 shows one example , the dust ",
    "lane galaxy ngc3108 .",
    "however , not all dust  lane elliptical galaxies have measurable amounts of hi .",
    "oosterloo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that the gas  to  dust ratio m@xmath3/m@xmath14 in five nearby dust ",
    "lane ellipticals ranges over two orders of magnitude from 1085 in ngc3108 to @xmath15 in eso263g48 .",
    "the reason for this is not yet clear since the dust and hi in the galaxies are expected to have a common origin .",
    "it may be that some galaxies have a large fraction of their cold gas in molecular form .    for several elliptical galaxies with settled hi disks , we used simple mass models to calculate the variation of m / l with radius .",
    "as may be seen from figure 3 , the mass  to  light ratios at large radius are similar to typical values for spiral galaxies , suggesting that the dark halos in elliptical and spiral galaxies have similar properties ( bertola et al .",
    "1993 , morganti et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "hi is more common in low ",
    "luminosity elliptical galaxies than in luminous ones ( lake & schommer 1984 ) , for reasons which are not yet completely clear .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to giant ellipticals , these low  luminosity galaxies are often forming stars in their central regions where the hi density is highest ( sadler et al .",
    "figure 4 shows two examples of galaxies in this class .",
    "the origin of the hi in these galaxies remains unclear . in some cases",
    "the observed misalignment of the hi rotation axis with the optical photometric axes suggests that it has been accreted , but in others the gas may be primordial ",
    "the galaxy ubv colours fit a models with slowly  declining star ",
    "formation rates , and it is plausible that the bulges in these galaxies have been built up slowly over a hubble time with some gas still reminaing .",
    "some of the galaxies we mapped in hi have active nuclei , disturbed hi morphology and other signs of a past interaction such as a counter  rotating stellar core .",
    "this work is still in progress , but analysis of the hi velocity field ( which is often multi  valued ) may eventually allow us to ` date ' the interactions and build up a time sequence for the triggering of agn in nearby galaxies .",
    "figure 5 shows an atca image of the hi distribution in and around the active galaxy ic1459 , which has a counter  rotating core ( franx & illingworth 1988 ) as well as a central radio source .",
    "hipass has already given us over 100 new hi detections of southern elliptical and s0 galaxies , and more will come in the near future . as a result , we now have a much larger and more homogeneous data set than has been available in the past , making it possible to study the hi properties of a large sample of early  type galaxies in a systematic way .",
    "hi imaging of elliptical galaxies , though observationally challenging at present , can provide valuable insights into both their structure and their history .    over the decade",
    "20052015 , next  generation radio telescopes ( the square kilometre array ( ska ) and its precursors ) will have a huge impact on hi studies of early  type galaxies . even distant galaxies with modest masses of cold gas will be easy to detect and image in hi , giving us a far more complete picture of the evolutionary history of these enigmatic galaxies .",
    "much of the work presented here was done in collaboration with our colleagues in the hipass team , in particular david barnes , erwin de blok , ron ekers , brbel koribalski and lister staveley  smith . we thank them for their assistance with the data analysis , and for many helpful discussions .",
    "ems was fortunate enough to be one of ken freeman s ph.d .",
    "students and thanks him for many valuable pieces of advice , including the suggestion ( in 1981 ) that it would be worth doing an hi survey of nearby elliptical galaxies .",
