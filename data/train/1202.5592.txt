    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most appealing theories as an extension of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it provides an elegant way to solve the gauge hierarchy problem and cancel the quadratic divergences of the radiative correction to the higgs boson mass .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains sm particles , their superpartners and an additional higgs doublet . in order to avoid the rapid proton decay ,",
    "a discrete @xmath3-parity symmetry@xcite is introduced in the mssm , which implies a conserved quantum number , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 being baryon number , lepton number and spin of the particle , respectively .",
    "for all the sm particles @xmath8 is equal to @xmath9 , while for all the superpartners @xmath8 is @xmath10 .",
    "so this symmetry leads to the result that the superpartners can only be produced in a pair and the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is stable .",
    "however , such a stringent symmetry appears to be a theoretical basis ; especially , we know that a stable proton can survive by imposing either @xmath6- or @xmath5-conservation @xcite . at the same time , there is not enough experimental evidence for @xmath3-parity conservation , so @xmath3-parity conservation is not necessary in the mssm .",
    "moreover , non - zero @xmath3-parity violating ( rpv ) couplings could provide small neutrino masses , which could explain the phenomena of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "thus , there are strong theoretical and phenomenological motivations to introduce partial @xmath3-parity violation into the most general representation of superpotential with the respect to the renormalizability and preservation of the gauge symmetries of sm and supersymmetry , which can be written as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 denote generation indices , @xmath15 are su(2 ) isospin indices , and @xmath16 are su(3 ) color indices .",
    "@xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are the left - handed leptons ( quarks ) su(2)-doublet chiral superfields , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) are the right - handed leptons ( up- and down - type quarks ) su(2)-singlet chiral superfields .",
    "@xmath22 are the higgs chiral superfields .",
    "the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the dimensionless @xmath6-violating coupling coefficients , and @xmath26 are the @xmath5-violating dimensionless coupling constants . as mentioned above , @xmath5 and @xmath6 can not be violated at the same time . in this paper",
    "we concentrate ourselves only on the @xmath6-violating couplings , where the coefficients @xmath27 may be assumed to be non - zero .",
    "the lhc can be used as a top - factory , and it is advantageous to study the production and decay of top quark .",
    "we suspect that the processes related with top quark can be used to probe the new physics effects since the top mass is close to the weak scale @xcite , particularly in the single top - quark production process the chiral structure of the interaction of the top quark may impact the polarization observable of the final top quark @xcite .",
    "therefore , the predictions including higher order corrections to single top - quark production within and beyond the sm are very important in exploring the new physics .    the single charged slepton production in association with a top quark at hadron collider",
    "is induced by the non - zero term @xmath28 in eq.([lagrangian-1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath29 process at the lhc receives the contributions from the partonic processes @xmath30 , where @xmath12 and @xmath14 are the generation indices . the second term in eq.([lagrangian-1 ] )",
    "is related to the born process @xmath31 , which can be expressed as @xmath32 + ~ \\textrm{h.c}. { \\end{array}}\\ ] ] for the nlo qcd calculations , the interaction vertices of two squarks and a slepton may be involved , which can be extracted from the general soft susy - breaking lagrangian @xcite @xmath33 in the above equation it is assumed that the soft breaking terms have a universal dimensionful parameter @xmath34 and are proportional to the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath24 . in this work we take the susy - breaking parameter @xmath35 , separately .",
    "the single top - quark production processes at colliders in the @xmath3-parity violating mssm has been studied in several references @xcite .",
    "the top - quark production in association with a slepton @xmath36 at hadron collider has been studied at leading order ( lo ) in refs.@xcite , there the authors performed the signal analysis , and found that the final states in the @xmath37 production at the lhc have distinct kinematic signatures , which can be distinguished from the backgrounds .    in this paper , we present the calculations of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to this process . the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the calculations for the relevant partonic processes and parent process @xmath38 at the lo and qcd nlo . in section iii , we give some numerical results and discussions . finally , a short summary is given .",
    "* a. lo calculation *    in both the lo and nlo calculations , we apply feynarts3.4 and formcalc5.3 packages @xcite to generate feynman diagrams , their corresponding amplitudes , and to simplify the amplitudes , separately . in table",
    "[ tab-1 ] the upper @xmath39 bounds on @xmath40 originating from refs.@xcite are listed .",
    "there the coefficients @xmath41 stem from assuming @xmath42 and left - right mixing in the sbottom sector .",
    "since we have the strong constraints on the @xmath43 coupling shown in table [ tab-1 ] and the low ( anti)bottom luminosity in parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the proton , which indicates there can not be any significant production rates via @xmath44 partonic processes at the lhc , we ignore their contributions in the following calculation .    .",

    "in this paper , we calculate the complete nlo qcd corrections to the single slepton associated with a ( anti)top - quark production process at the early ( @xmath47 ) and future ( @xmath48 ) lhc .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the lo and the nlo qcd integrated cross sections on the factorization / renormalization energy scale , and study the influence of slepton , stop - quark and gluino masses on the nlo qcd corrected cross sections .",
    "we point out that the uncertainty of the lo cross section due to the introduced energy scale @xmath49 is apparently improved by including nlo qcd corrections , and the exclusive jet event selection scheme keeps the convergence of the perturbative calculations better than the inclusive scheme .",
    "we find also that the susy qcd correction generally increases if the @xmath1 or @xmath2 mass is getting large , but the non - zero @xmath50@xmath51@xmath52 coupling with @xmath53 could distort that curve tendency in some cases .",
    "we present the lo and the qcd corrected distributions of the transverse momenta of final products involving ( anti)top quark , muon and the lightest neutralino .",
    "our results show that the nlo qcd corrections suppress the polarization asymmetries of final ( anti)top quark , and mostly enhance the transverse momentum distributions of final particles .",
