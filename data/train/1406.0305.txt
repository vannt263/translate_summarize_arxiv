    "quenched disorder plays very important role in condensed matter physics .",
    "a prominent example is the anderson localization that predicts all quantum states are localized in one and two spatial dimensions if interactions between particles can be neglected@xcite .",
    "it has been proved rigorously that quenched disorder destroys ordered states and rounds singularity of phase transitions@xcite .",
    "however recently , a counter - intuitive possibility was pointed out and examined .",
    "that is , a quenched disorder generates a new ordered state , which is different from the original one , if that quenched disorder breaks a continuous symmetry of the original system without the quenched disorder .",
    "this possibility was first studied in a classical xy spin model coupled with a random external magnetic field@xcite and then the resultant order is called random - field - induced order ( rfio ) .",
    "shortly after the proposal , it was shown that such phenomena of the rfio can be observed by experiments on systems of ultra - cold bosonic atoms of multiple - internal states@xcite . in bose atomic gases ,",
    "a bose - einstein condensed ( bec ) state is the genuine ordered state , and a random raman scattering of the internal states of the atom plays a role of a quenched random external magnetic field .",
    "then , it is expected that the rfio can be observed in the ultra - cold atomic gas systems .",
    "there are other interesting works on the rfio@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall investigate the rfio in detail for the two - component cold bosonic gases in a square optical lattice ( ol ) .",
    "in particular , we consider the bosonic t - j model , which is a low - energy effective model for the bose - hubbard model in the strong - repulsion limit@xcite .",
    "this model exhibits both the pseudo - spin order and the becs and is therefore suitable for study of the rfio .",
    "we employ quantum monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations that take into account all of fluctuations .",
    "thus the present study is in sharp contrast to the previous ones that used estimation of classical energy of the xy spin configurations for observing a possible rfio@xcite and a mean - field theory with gross - pitaevskii equations for the bec of the rfio@xcite .",
    "furthermore we will investigate behavior of low - energy topological excitations such as vortices and domain walls in the rfio states , and reveal interesting properties of them .",
    "finite - temperature ( @xmath0 ) phase diagram is also obtained , which is useful for discussion on the robustness of the rfio states .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we introduce and explain the bosonic t - j model with a random external field .",
    "path - integral quantization using the slave - particle representation is explained .",
    "effective field theory for the pseudo - spin and becs is derived by integrating out amplitude degrees of freedom of the slave - particle field variables . in sec.3 , a replica mean - field theory",
    "is applied to the effective field theory and effects of the random field are studied .",
    "this study clearly shows how the rfio appears as a result of the random field with a moderate fluctuation . in sec.4 ,",
    "the results of the numerical simulations are given .",
    "phase diagrams at vanishing @xmath0 as well as finite-@xmath0 are obtained .",
    "various correlation functions , which are used for the identification of the orders are shown . in sec.5 . , topological excitations like vortices and domain wall are investigated numerically .",
    "properties of these excitations are discussed from the view point of the rfio .",

    "the bosonic t - j model , which describes dynamics of two internal states of a boson , which we call @xmath1- and @xmath2-boson for simplicity , in a square ol , is defined by the following hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are boson creation ( destruction ) operators at site @xmath6 of the square lattice and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the hopping amplitude between the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites .",
