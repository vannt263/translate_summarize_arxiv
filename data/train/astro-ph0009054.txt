    "@xcite ) , although mateo ( @xcite ) gives 24kpc ] and belong to a stellar system with a star formation history different from that of the milky way , it was decided to obtain radio continuum data and to improve on the abundances and other physical quantities of the nebulae and central stars by means of photoionization models .",
    "wray  16 - 423 was observed with the australian telescope compact array on 1997 , june 19th , simultaneously at 8.6 and 4.8  ghz over a 12-hour integration .",
    "the array was in its ` 6a ' configuration with baselines ranging from 330 m to 5940 m , maximizing the angular resolution .",
    "the radio source 1933@xmath8400 was used for phase calibration .",
    "the amplitude calibration was based on 1934@xmath8638 , adopting the new fluxes of 5.826  jy and 2.814  jy at 4.8  ghz and 8.64  ghz respectively .",
    "( the new scale differs from the previous one , changing the spectral index between 3 and 6  cm by 0.3 .",
    "this scale agrees with the one used in the northern hemisphere to within 12% . )",
    "the data were analyzed using the miriad and aips packages .",
    "a full calibration of instrumental polarization was done to optimize the flux calibration .",
    "tests done during the observations showed a pointing accuracy of better than @xmath9 .",
    "altitude - dependent pointing errors were minimized as the phase calibration was close to the target source .",
    "the calibrated data were fourier transformed to produce images and cleaned to replace the dirty point spread function by a gaussian beam",
    ". a signal - to - noise ratio of 300 was measured before self - calibration , confirming the quality of the data .",
    "the fwhm of the resulting gaussian beam was @xmath10 at 6  cm and @xmath11 at 3  cm , with position angle near zero degrees , owing to the 12-hour integration .",
    "because the point - spread function is mathematically known , sizes can be obtained even for sources several times smaller than the beam for sufficiently high signal - to - noise .",
    "wray  16 - 423 was found to be slightly resolved at 3  cm , with equivalent fwhm of a gaussian source of @xmath12 at position angle 58 degrees ( measured from north to east on the sky ) . at 6  cm a size of @xmath13",
    "was found with the same position angle .",
    "the pn appears unresolved along its short axis but the observed elongation is not an instrumental artefact , given that the position angle is quite different from that of the beam .",
    "thus , wray  16 - 423 may have an elliptical or otherwise elongated morphology with axial ratio of order 2:1 or more .",
    "correction factors between fwhm gaussian diameters and uniform disk diameters for slightly resolved sources are provided by bedding & zijlstra ( @xcite ) and van hoof ( @xcite ) : for wray  16 - 423 the gaussian diameter should be multiplied by a factor of 1.6 , giving approximately @xmath14 for the major axis . in paper",
    "i , a ground - based  image of wray  16 - 423 was deconvolved and a 1.2@xmath150.8@xmath16 ellipse with position angle 50@xmath17 was found .",
    "the radio and optical descriptions are therefore in agreement within uncertainties .",
    "the total flux of wray  16 - 423 was 4.72  mjy at 6  cm and 4.31  mjy at 3  cm .",
    "the flux accuracy , limited by the noise in the map ( 0.06  mjy / beam ) and the systematic uncertainty in the flux scale , is 0.20  mjy at the 3-@xmath18 level .",
    "the spectral index is found to be @xmath19 , very close to the theoretical value of @xmath20 for optically thin radio emission , thus confirming the accuracy of the relative flux calibration .",
    "he  2 - 436 was observed at the vla on october 1 , 1998 , using 15-minute snapshots at 3.6  cm ( 8.4  ghz ) , 6  cm ( 4.89  ghz ) and 20  cm ( 1.46  ghz ) . the array was in the b configuration .",
    "3c286 was used as flux calibrator and 1924 - 292 the phase calibrator . due to the short integrations ,",
    "the calibration is less accurate than for wray  16 - 423 .    after cleaning and self - calibration ,",
    "he  2 - 436 was detected at all bands although very faint at 20  cm .",
    "the flux was determined as @xmath21 mjy at 20  cm , @xmath22 mjy at 6  cm and @xmath23 mjy at 3.6  cm .",
    "the uncertainty comes from the noise in the map ( around 0.1 mjy / beam but 0.16 mjy / beam at 20  cm ) and an estimate of the uncertainty in the flux calibration .",
    "the source was unresolved . at 3.6",
    "cm where the beam was @xmath24 ( elongated ns ) , an upper limit to the size of @xmath25 in the ew direction was found .",
    "the turn - over frequency between optically thick and optically thin emission may occur near 8  ghz , suggestive of a high density pn .",
    "assuming @xmath26 at 20  cm , the observed flux of 0.62 mjy corresponds to a source diameter of @xmath27",
    ". the diameter may be larger if the optical depth is not constant across the nebula .",
    "the spectral index between 6 and 20  cm is @xmath28 , compatible with an @xmath29 density distribution .",

    "this freedom allowed some consequences of varying the hardness of the ionizing continuum to be studied .",

    "@xcite ) since the ionized mass of he  2 - 436 is small .",
    "now , in case of uneven dust extinction , the balmer - decrement method _ underestimates _ the true average extinction , at variance with what observational data suggest .",
    "thus , until radio fluxes are obtained at higher frequencies , the balmer - decrement reddening is adopted on account of the excellent agreement between c@xmath51 and c@xmath52 in the case of wray  16 - 423 .",

    "@xcite ) , corresponding to @xmath81  , in extremely good agreement with the two pne . together with the high c / o of the pne ,",
    "this is strong evidence that the carbon stars form the source population of the pne .",

    "it is therefore suggested that [ fe / h ] of the agb stars is in fact @xmath88 rather than @xmath82 .",

    "abundances of nitrogen and carbon demonstrate the operation of the first and third dredge - ups . the larger overabundance of carbon in he@xmath902 - 436  is not unexpected as the total amount of third - dredge - up material may depend on the timing of the last thermal pulse(s ) .",
    "the excess nitrogen in wray@xmath9016 - 423  is more intriguing , considering that second dredge - up does not occur in low - mass stars and helium is equally abundant in both objects .",
    "the large helium overabundance may be another problem .",
    "the photoionization codes provide well - defined results for wray  16 - 423 and a larger range of acceptable solutions for he  2 - 436 . in the latter case ,",
    "the unicity of solution breaks down , as a consequence of the high density in the inner shell .",
    "line fluxes are matched within the 1-@xmath18 statistical errors , that is only a few percent for most basic lines , whilst the degrees of freedom are outnumbered by the independent observables .    despite their [ wc ] spectra ,",
    "both central stars delineate the 1.2  h - burning track , in fair agreement with the mass of the carbon stars of sagittarius .",
    "the abundances of the pne may help to calibrate the stellar photometry of the more metal - rich population in this galaxy .",
    "improving the absolute  and radio fluxes for he@xmath902 - 436  and , particularly , observing at radio frequencies above 9  ghz would more tightly constrain the geometry of the nebula and the luminosity of the nucleus , then leading to a more accurate mass of the star . concerning wray@xmath9016 - 423",
    ", the critical parameter to improve the positioning on the hr diagram is the effective temperature of the nucleus .",
