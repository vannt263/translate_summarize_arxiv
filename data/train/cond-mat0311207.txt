    "the trapping of brownian particles by static traps randomly distributed over either a euclidean or a disordered substrate is a fundamental problem of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics and chemistry with a very wide range of applications @xcite .",
    "this is also one of the oldest problems in random walk theory which was essentially formulated by smoluchowski at the beginning of past century in his theory of coagulation of colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "this model has proven useful in research areas such as the trapping of mobile defects in crystals with point sinks @xcite , the kinetics of luminescent organic materials @xcite , the kinetics of photosynthetic light energy to oxygen conversion @xcite , anchoring of polymers by chemically active sites @xcite , atomic diffusion in glasslike materials @xcite , and others @xcite . some generalizations of the basic model have also been considered recently .",
    "the case of a gated ( ungated ) random walker trapped by a distribution of ungated ( gated ) fixed traps has been proposed in connection with the kinetics of reactions between complex molecules whose active groups are screened as the molecules diffuse @xcite . the trapping problem with many random walkers has also been studied in one dimension @xcite and the corresponding trapping statistics have been found on euclidean and fractal lattices @xcite .",
    "the multiparticle predator - prey problems in which a single fixed trap , the `` lamb '' , is captured by one of a set of @xmath3 random walkers or `` lions '' initially placed at a given distance from the prey was also discussed by krapivsky and redner @xcite .",
    "another quite interesting and difficult variation of the standard trapping problem is that where the traps diffuse too @xcite .    trapping reactions between molecules embedded in biological samples and disordered materials are usually handicapped by the porous and statistical fractal structure of these media @xcite . in some cases",
    "this gives rise to subdiffusion of the particles , i.e. , the mean square displacement @xmath4 of the particles from the original starting site is no longer linear on time , but verifies a generalized fick s second law : @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 ) is the ( anomalous ) diffusion exponent and @xmath8 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "of course , there are many other instances in which subdiffusion processes appear @xcite .",
    "a useful approach for understanding subdiffusion processes is by means of the continuous time random walk model ( ctrw ) in which the random walker performs jumps with a waiting time distribution with a broad long - time tail : @xmath9 for large @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the long - time tail of this waiting time distribution incorporates , in a statistical sense , the effect of the bottlenecks and the dead - ends in the diffusion of the random walker embedded in the disordered structure , and the model is compatible with eq.([r2 t ] ) . for subdiffusive random walkers the continuum description given by the ordinary diffusion equation",
    "is replaced by the fractional diffusion equation @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the riemann - liouville fractional derivative of order @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the probability density that the particle that started at @xmath15 at time @xmath15 is at @xmath16 at time @xmath2 .",
    "our objective in this paper is to find analytical expressions for the survival probability @xmath1 defined as the probability that no trap site has been reached by the _ subdiffusive _ random walker by time @xmath2 .",
    "two variations of the classical trapping problem ( sometimes called rosenstock s trapping problem ) are considered : ( i ) the `` one - sided '' trapping problem @xcite in which only _ one half - line _ of a one - dimensional lattice is filled with a random distribution of static traps ( this process could mimic the excitation or production of defects on one side of a fiber by irradiation , the other side being shielded ) ; and ( ii ) the `` two - sided '' trapping problem corresponding to the trapping of a single subdiffusive random walker placed initially at @xmath17 between _ two half - lines _ ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) randomly filled with static traps . we find exact analytical solutions for both problems and compare them with simulations . as precedents of these results we whould cite the work of blumen , klafter and zumofen ( see @xcite and references therein ) about the trapping of particles on euclidean and fractal substrates for random walkers with waiting time distributions with broad long - time tails : @xmath20 , @xmath21 .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ sec : onesided ] the exact solution of the one - sided trapping problem is obtained and compared with simulation results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rosenstock ] we build the extended rosenstock s approximation for the survival probability of the particle in the one - sided trapping problem by calculating an exact expression for the moments of the one - sided span ( the number of distinct sites visited by the random walker in a given direction ) . in sec .  [ sec : twosided ] we obtain the exact survival probability of the subdiffusive random walker for the two - sided case in integral form .",
    "this integral is evaluated in the asymptotic long - time and short - time limits in order to get simple closed expressions .",
    "the paper ends with some conclusions and remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the one - sided trapping model quenched traps are randomly distributed on , say , the right - hand side of a one - dimensional lattice ( @xmath19 ) with concentration @xmath0 .",
    "the random walker is placed initially upon site @xmath17 and performs jumps to its nearest neighbour sites with a waiting time distribution @xmath22 until it reaches a trap site where it is absorbed .",
    "the survival probability is given by @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the probability that the span of the random walker in the positive direction ( the largest distance reached by the random walker for @xmath19 ) is equal to @xmath26 after @xmath2 time steps .",
