    "one of the most promising inflationary scenarios is hybrid inflation ( hi ) @xcite , which is naturally realized @xcite in supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) models . in its standard realization ,",
    "though , the gut gauge symmetry ( @xmath3 ) breaking occurs at the end of inflation leading @xcite to a disastrous production of magnetic monopoles if these defects are predicted by the underlying symmetry breaking .",
    "this problem is avoided in the smooth @xcite or shifted @xcite variants of susy hi , where @xmath3 is broken to the standard model gauge group ( @xmath4 ) already during inflation ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these two variants of susy hi , originally based on non - renormalizable superpotential terms , can be implemented @xcite with only renormalizable terms in an extended susy gut model based on the pati - salam ( ps ) gauge group @xmath5 @xcite , whose breaking to @xmath4 predicts @xcite the existence of doubly charged monopoles .",
    "it is very interesting to point out that this extended susy ps model was motivated @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) by a very different issue : in susy models with yukawa unification ( yu)@xcite , such as the simplest susy ps model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and universal boundary conditions , the mass of the @xmath0-quark ( @xmath6 ) turns out @xcite to be too large for @xmath1 . by appropriately extending the model ,",
    "however , yu is modestly violated and @xmath6 can be adequately reduced .    fitting the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite with the standard power - law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant , one obtains a spectral index @xmath2 clearly lower than unity . however , in canonical supergravity ( sugra ) , these hi models yield @xcite @xmath2 s which are very close to unity or even larger than unity .",
    "one way @xcite to reduce @xmath2 is by restricting the number of e - foldings of our present horizon during the main part of inflation which is responsible for the observed density perturbations .",
    "the additional e - foldings required for solving the horizon and flatness problems can be provided by a subsequent second stage of inflation .",
    "we show @xcite that the same extended susy ps model of ref .",
    "@xcite leads to a two - stage inflationary scenario with acceptable values of @xmath2 in minimal sugra .",
    "the first stage is of the standard hybrid type , while the second is of the smooth hybrid type .",
    "so , the name standard - smooth hi is coined for this scenario .",
    "standard hi occurs along a trivial flat direction on which @xmath7 is unbroken .",
    "as the inflaton drops below a critical value , this direction is destabilized giving its place to a non - flat valley for smooth hi on which @xmath7 is broken .",
    "note that the same extended susy ps model can lead @xcite to an alternative inflationary scenario with cosmic strings @xcite ( for a textbook presentation or a review , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , since it possesses a semi - shifted flat direction on which @xmath8 is unbroken .",
    "when the system crosses the critical point of this path , @xmath8 breaks and cosmic strings are produced contributing to the primordial perturbations , in which case , the data allow @xcite larger values of @xmath2 . in this semi - shifted inflationary scenario , no magnetic monopoles are formed .",
    "in this model @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the breaking of @xmath7 to @xmath4 is achieved by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of a conjugate pair of higgs superfields @xmath9 and @xmath10 belonging to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 representations of @xmath7 respectively .",
    "there also exist a gauge singlet @xmath13 and a conjugate pair of superfields @xmath14 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 , the vev of @xmath14 , breaking @xmath7 to @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to @xmath7 , the model possesses a @xmath18 matter parity symmetry and two global @xmath19 symmetries , namely a peccei - quinn and a r symmetry .",
    "the superpotential terms relevant for inflation are @xcite @xmath20 where the mass parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , the susy gut scale ) and any two of the three dimensionless coupling constants @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 can be made real and positive by an appropriate rephasing of the fields .",
    "we choose the third dimensionless coupling constant to be real and positive too .",
    "the f  term scalar potential obtained from the superpotential @xmath27 in eq .   is @xmath28    from this potential and the vanishing of the d",
    " terms ( which yields @xmath29 ) , we find @xcite two distinct continua of susy vacua : @xmath30 with @xmath31 , where @xmath32",
    "the potential @xmath33 in eq .   possesses @xcite three flat directions :    @xmath34 the trivial flat direction : @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 the new shifted one ( for @xmath38 ) on which @xmath7 is broken to @xmath4 : @xmath39    @xmath40 the semi - shifted one ( for @xmath41 ) : @xmath42 on which @xmath7 is broken to @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 .",
    "we will take @xmath47 . in this case , the semi - shifted flat direction does not exist . also , @xmath48 and , thus , the system will eventually settle down on the trivial flat direction . expanding @xmath14 , @xmath49 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 as @xmath50 , we find @xcite , on the trivial direction , the @xmath51 matrices @xmath52 of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 of @xmath56 , @xmath57 : @xmath58 and the @xmath51 matrices @xmath59 of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 of @xmath63 , @xmath64 : @xmath65 the matrices @xmath66 acquire one negative eigenvalue for @xmath67 and the trivial direction becomes unstable .    for @xmath68 , the trivial direction , after its destabilization at @xmath69",
    ", gives its place @xcite to a valley of minima with @xmath70 , which leads to the corresponding susy vacua in eq .  .",
    "this valley possesses a classical inclination and can accommodate a second stage of inflation of the new smooth hybrid type .",
    "the standard - smooth hi scenario goes @xcite as follows :    @xmath34 the system initially inflates on the trivial direction which acquires a slope from the one - loop radiative correction ( rc ) @xcite due to the susy breaking caused by the constant potential energy density @xmath71 .",
    "so , we get a first stage of inflation of the standard hybrid type .",
    "@xmath37 as the system moves below @xmath69 , @xmath7 breaks to @xmath4 . after a short intermediate inflationary phase ,",
    "the system settles down on the new smooth path and new smooth hi occurs .",
    "the second stage of inflation ( intermediate phase plus new smooth hi ) yields the additional e - foldings for solving the horizon and flatness problems . at the end",
    ", the system falls into the susy vacua leading , though , to no magnetic monopoles , since @xmath7 is broken to @xmath4 during the second stage of inflation .",
    "however , two important requirements must be fulfilled @xcite :    @xmath72 the number of e - foldings during the second stage of inflation must be adequately large for diluting any monopoles generated at the end of the first stage .",
    "@xmath73 cosmological scales get perturbations only from the first stage of inflation .",
    "the one - loop rc @xcite to the potential @xmath33 from susy breaking on the trivial path is calculated by the coleman - weinberg formula @xcite : @xmath74 where we sum over helicity states , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the fermion number and @xmath51 of the @xmath77th state and @xmath78 is a renormalization scale .",
    "so , we need the mass spectrum of the model on the trivial path .",
