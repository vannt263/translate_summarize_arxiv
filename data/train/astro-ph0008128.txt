    "with respect to the presence of such a torus , the most compelling results are : ( a ) vlba 8 ghz data ( gallimore et al .",
    "1997 ) revealing a 1 pc elongated distribution of ionized gas at pa @xmath4 110  ( the inner `` hot zone '' of the torus ? ) , ( b ) adaptive optics ( ao ) observations at 2.2 @xmath0 m ( rouan et al , 1998 ) showing extended emission along pa @xmath6 102  and up to a 15 pc radius ( in addition to a prominent unresolved core with size less that 9 pc and in addition to another 20 pc radius extended emission along pa @xmath6 15  which follows the narrow line region ) and at 3.5 and 4.8 @xmath0 m ( marco & alloin , 2000 ) revealing structures similar in shape / orientation and on comparable scales , ( c ) near- and mid - ir imaging polarimetry ( lumsden et al . 1999 ) calling for the presence of hot and warm dust components fully consistent with those detected with ao .",
    "the structure elongated at pa @xmath4 102   could trace the equatorial plane of an inclined dusty / molecular torus , from its inner walls of ionized material seen in radio , to its outer parts of thermally emitting dust with a temperature range from t @xmath4 1500 k ( dust sublimation temperature ) to a few 100 k.    models by krolik & begelman ( 1986 ) , pier & krolik ( 1993 ) , efstathiou & rowan - robinson ( 1994 ) , granato & danese ( 1994 ) , and granato , danese & franceschini ( 1997 ) have explored torus sizes from 1 to 100 pc .",
    "they predict emission in the near - ir and mid - ir and provide high resolution model - maps at various wavelengths .",
    "therefore , it is particularly timely to obtain high resolution mid - ir images to compare with model - maps .    here",
    ", we present and discuss new results from diffraction - limited images obtained with the cfht / hawaii and eso / la silla 3.6 m telescopes , at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "hereafter , the distance used for ngc1068 is 14.4 mpc , leading to the equivalence 1@xmath4 70 pc in the object .",
    "the observations were performed using the cea / sap mid - ir camera camiras ( lagage et al 1993 ) , equipped with a boeing 128x128 pixels bib detector which is sensitive up to 28 @xmath0 m .",
    "the agn in ngc1068 was observed with camiras attached to the eso / la silla 3.6 m telescope on 1998 november 8 - 10 and to the cfht / hawaii 3.6 m telescope on 1999 august 1 . during these two runs seeing and weather conditions  humidity and amount of atmospheric precipitable water  were particularly favorable to observing in the mid - ir and extremely stable .",
    "the orientation of the array on the sky was carefully determined at the start of each observing run .",
    "the pixel size was @xmath7 ( 20 @xmath0 m window , eso / la silla ) and @xmath8 ( 11 @xmath0 m window , cfht / hawaii ) .    in the 20 @xmath0 m window",
    ", we used a filter centered at 20.5 @xmath0 m and with a bandpass ( fwhm ) @xmath9 = 1.11 @xmath0 m .",
    "this filter is free of any important line contribution . in the 11 @xmath0 m window , we used a filter centered at 11.2 @xmath0 m and with a bandpass @xmath9 = 0.44 @xmath0 m : although the 11.3 @xmath0 m pah line emission falls within this filter , one should notice that the spectroscopic results from the iso satellite do not show its presence in the agn of ngc1068 ( aperture of @xmath10 ) .",
    "therefore we are confident that these two filters reflect mostly the mid - ir continuum emission of the agn . to avoid saturation of the detector by the high ambient photon background ,",
    "the image elementary integration times were chosen to be 9.1 msec and 19.1 msec , respectively at 20.5 and 11.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "standard chopping and nodding techniques were applied with a chopping throw of @xmath11 .",
    "elementary images were coadded in real time during 3 sec chopping cycles . at 20.5",

    "the total integration on source was of 65 min and the mean airmass of 1.04 .",
    "a shift - and - add procedure was applied to the final images through each filter .",

    "the precision achieved in flux measurements is + / 5% and + / 10% , respectively at 11.2 @xmath0 m and 20.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "because final images are limited by the seeing and above all by the 3.6 m telescope diffraction - pattern ( fwhm of @xmath21 and @xmath22 at 20.5 @xmath0 m and 11.2 @xmath0 m respectively ) , applying a deconvolution procedure is mandatory .",
    "we use the entropy method developed by pantin & starck ( 1996 ) , based upon wavelet decomposition . the shannon theorem ( 1948 )",
    "prescription allows to persue the deconvolution down to twice the pixel size , in this case down to @xmath2 , and iterations are stopped according to the residual map , whose properties should be consistent with data noise characteristics .",
    "we provide in figure 1 a set of the images at 20.5 @xmath0 m : the ngc1068 image before deconvolution , the psf stellar image , and the ngc1068 image after deconvolution . a similar set of images at 11.2",
    "@xmath0 m is displayed in figure 2 .",
    "the general orientation of the extended emission runs through the north - east to south - west quadrants , with a noticeable north - south elongation of the inner isophotes .",
    "the deconvolved image and contours at 11.2 @xmath0 m are fully consistent with the map at 12.4 @xmath0 m obtained at a comparable spatial resolution by braatz et al ( 1993 ) . in the 10 @xmath0 m window ,",
    "the speckle data ( over a @xmath23 region , with a resolution down to @xmath24 , but with a smaller dynamical range ) analyzed by bock et al ( 1998 ) indicate however a different orientation with the extended emission in the inner @xmath23 region running through the north - west to south - east quadrants : this does not appear to be consistent with either braatz et al ( 1993 ) or the new data set presented in this paper .",
    "this discrepancy remains to be elucidated .",
    "the deconvolved images , both at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m show the presence of a prominent central core .",
    "cuts through the core along the north - south and east - west directions provide fwhm values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "therefore , the core remains unresolved in the east - west direction , while it appears to be extended north - south with intrinsic fwhm size of around 50 pc .",
    "again this result is in very good agreement with braatz et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "regarding the extended emission , one notices that conspicuous features can be seen further away from the core at 20.5 @xmath0 m than at 11.2 @xmath0 m . in the north - east quadrant",
    "we have identified two clouds , ( a ) and ( b ) , along pa @xmath6 35 , at mean distances from the core of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "cloud(a ) , which is bright both at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m , appears to widen perpendicularly to the main direction of the extended emission and runs from pa @xmath6 15  to pa @xmath6 55 . in the south - west quadrant , the emission closest to the core extends along pa @xmath6 210  and then aligns north - south : two clouds , ( c ) and ( d ) , can be singled out at mean distances from the core of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "flux measurements at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m have been performed using a mask built from the 20.5 @xmath0 m image and delineating the extent of the four clouds and of the core , so that the 11.2 @xmath0 m to 20.5 @xmath0 m flux ratio can be derived in a consistent fashion .",
    "the mask at the position of the core takes into account the full extent ( @xmath29 ) of the core ( rather than its fwhms values given in table 1 ) .",
    "the resultant fluxes are given in table 1 : one notices that the core contributes a very large fraction of the mid - ir emission , 95.6% at 11.2 @xmath0 m and 94% at 20.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "we have just seen that the mid - ir emission extends away from the core up to a radius of about 300 pc , both in the north - east and south - west quadrants . in order to compare this extension / structure to those observed at other wavelengths , in the radio range with the vla or in the uv / optical with hst ,",
    "it is mandatory to register precisely the mid - ir map with respect to the near - ir , visible and radio ones .    as we did not have the possibility to perform astrometric measurements through simultaneous observations in the mid - ir and near - ir or visible ( as performed in marco et al 1997 )",
    ", we are assuming firstly that the cores at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m are coincident and secondly that their location also coincides with that of the cores observed at 4.8 , 3.5 and 2.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "regarding the first assumption , one can check from the model of ngc1068 developed by granato et al ( 1997 ) which predicts the offsets between emission peaks at various wavelengths in the near - ir to mid - ir , that these offsets remain in the range of a few hundredths of an arc second and can be ignored . regarding the second assumption , the cores observed at 4.8 , 3.5 and 2.2 @xmath0 m",
    "have been shown to be positionally coincident indeed ( rouan et al , 1998 , marco & alloin 2000 ) . and",
    "finally , marco et al ( 1997 ) have obtained the astrometric positioning of the core at 2.2 @xmath0 m , with respect to the hst map in the visible of the central area in ngc1068 : it was found to be located @xmath30 south and @xmath31 west of the so - called optical continuum peak seen with hst ( lynds et al 1991 ) .",
    "the study by marco et al ( 1997 ) also allowed a precise registration of the 2.2 @xmath0 m map with respect to the 12.4 @xmath0 m map from braatz et al ( 1993 ) and to available radio , optical and uv maps .",
    "the conclusion is that the core at 4.8 , 3.5 and 2.2 @xmath0 m appears to be coincident with the 12.4 @xmath0 m peak position found by braatz et al , the radio source s1 , the symmetry center of polarization both in the uv / optical ( capetti et al 1995 ) and in the mid - ir ( lumsden et al 1999 ) .",
    "we consider this core to feature the central engine ( hidden in uv / optical maps ) and from all the above quoted studies we can ascertain the consistency of the assumptions made earlier .",
    "we have compared the mid - ir maps at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m to the radio maps and to the hst [ oiii]emitting cloud map , provided on a suitable scale in bland - hawthorn et al ( 1997 ) and with a registration as above .",
    "we have reached the following conclusions : +  compared to the radio maps from gallimore et al ( 1996a , b ) and muxlow et al ( 1996 ) , the observed north - south elongation of the mid - ir core is reminiscent of the north - south alignment of the radio sources s2 , s1 and c ( see figure 2 in bland ",
    "hawthorn et al 1997 for a synthesis of the radio source nomenclature after wilson & ulvestad 1987 ) . at the location of radio source c ,",
    "the orientation of the radio jet - like structure changes abruptly and becomes close to pa @xmath6 35 , matching then the general direction of the mid - ir extended emission in the north - east quadrant .",
    "the mid - ir cloud(a ) coincides perfectly with the wide base of the so - called northeast radio lobe . in the south - west quadrant ,",
    "the radio jet - like structure is along pa @xmath6 210 again very well aligned with the mid - ir extended emission .",
    "the so - called southwest radio hotspot is situated about @xmath5 away from the central engine , s1 , and can be put in correspondence with the mid - ir cloud(d ) .",
    "+  compared with the hst [ oiii]emitting cloud map , the north - south elongation of the mid - ir core is found to overlap to the north with hst cloud - a and cloud - b , two nlr clouds distributed along the north - south direction .",
    "the extended mid - ir emission in the north - east quadrant is along pa @xmath6 35  and arises to the eastern edge of the ionizing cone ( which , on a large scale extends between pa @xmath6 15  and pa @xmath6 35 ) defined by the [ oiii]emitting complexes , beyond cloud - f and to the east of cloud - g which is itself located about @xmath27 away from the central engine .",
    "it should be noted as well that the mid - ir cloud(a ) is located very close to an optical emission knot early identified in the literature as the `` northeast knot '' in the direction pa @xmath6 35  and at a distance about @xmath5 from the central engine ( elvius 1978 for the first identification ) .",
    "the extended mid - ir emission in the south - west quadrant has no counterpart in the hst [ oiii]emitting cloud map , as expected from the heavy obscuration on that side of the agn .",
    "therefore , it is conspicuous that the extended mid - ir emission in the north - east quadrant arises aside the nlr ( as featured by the [ oiii]emitting clouds ) and from material which is not directly exposed to the central ionizing source .",
    "however , the tight correlation existing between the mid - ir extended emission and the 4.9 ghz emission is a result which signals the importance of the radio jet - like emission impacting on interstellar material located above and below the equatorial plane of the dusty / molecular torus .",
    "the emission core observed at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m shows a noticeable north - south extension , about 100 pc , while it remains unresolved ( @xmath32 50 pc ) along the east - west direction . in the model devised by granato et al ( 1997 ) of the agn in ngc1068 ,",
    "a 100 pc torus and a viewing angle of 65  were the torus parameters finally selected to match the sed of the agn .",
    "this model predicts indeed that maps of the torus emission in the mid - ir should be elongated perpendicularly to the torus plane , in this case roughly along the north - south direction , and on a scale of +",
    "/ @xmath33 .",
    "one should notice however that the model maps have been obtained after convolution with a psf fwhm @xmath34 , too narrow compared with the effective psf of the data presented in this paper .",
    "yet , the predicted direction of the elongation is consistent with the observed one at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m and its predicted size has the right order of magnitude , if compared to the measured one .",
    "+ comparing the core at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m to high resolution maps at 4.8 , 3.5 and 2.2 @xmath0 m ( marco & alloin 2000 , rouan et al 1998 ) is more difficult because of the difference in spatial resolution . indeed , the extensions ( both polar and equatorial ) seen at 4.8 , 3.5 and 2.2 @xmath0 m are entirely enclosed within the 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m core size . yet , if the pa @xmath6 102  equatorial extension detected at 4.8 , 3.5 and 2.2 @xmath0 m features the torus itself , one might expect to see emission in the mid - ir from cool dust located further away than the warm dust emitting at 4.8 @xmath0 m , still along ( pa @xmath6 102 ) . such emission is not detected .",
    "one possible interpretation is that the equatorial extension at 4.8 , 3.5 and 2.2 @xmath0 m does not directly feature the torus .",
    "this indeed would be surprising , because the covering factor of the equatorial extension to the central source is smaller than expected on the basis of several arguments ( opening angle of the ionizing cone , ratio between ir and primary uv radiation ... ) .",
    "the extended equatorial emission at 4.8 , 3.5 and 2.2 @xmath0 m could instead trace only the equatorial plane of the torus rather than the torus itself ( possibly smaller ) and outline the merging of the torus with the host  galaxy disc , in regions of high density where star formation is occurring and provides an additional and local source of heating .",
    "this would explain the presence of dust at a temperature much higher than that predicted by torus models which take only into account the heating from the central engine .",
    "the dust emission in these regions located in the torus equatorial plane but `` around - the - torus '' could then be more prominent at 4.8 than at 11.2 and 20.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "in fact there is a whole new area to be explored at the transition between the molecular / dusty torus and its environment .",
    "the comparison of maps in the radio , mid - ir , near - ir and optical / uv can potentially bring clues about the origin of the mid - ir extended emission beyond the torus itself : extra dust components , location , source of heating , etc .",
    "unfortunately , one can not yet confront in detail the observed maps with predicted model - maps for the following reason : existing agn models are targeted at representing the molecular / dusty torus itself rather than the full molecular / dusty environment of an agn and therefore do not take into account the presence of the nlr region or more generally the distribution of matter away from the torus itself .",
    "for example , thermal emission from warm dust possibly surviving on the back and uv  protected side of nlr clouds is not considered , the impact of the radio jets on intervening material such as the nlr clouds or massive molecular clouds away from the equatorial plane of the torus are not taken into account either .",
    "on the contrary , current results on the extended mid - ir emission in ngc1068 are telling us that material is present and heated around and away from the torus itself , up to a distance of @xmath4 300 pc .",
    "assuming silicate grains with a power  law ( -3.5 exponent ) size distribution over the size range 0.01 to 0.1 @xmath0 m , the 11.2 to 20.5 @xmath0 m flux ratio observed in cloud(a ) and cloud(c ) implies temperatures of around 150 k. cloud(a ) is already more than 200 pc away from the central engine and on the edge of the ionizing cone : how are the grains heated up to this temperature ?",
    "what is the role played by single photon transient heating of small grains ? by the radio jet - like structure which appears to coincide so closely with the mid - ir extended emission ?",
    "these questions deserve a more complete analysis and a quantitative modeling which is deferred to a specific and later work .",
    "mid - ir imaging at high angular resolution offers potential advantages in the study of agn environment because this wavelength range is specific of warm / cool dust emission ( and possibly synchrotron emission from electrons ) and because extinction is reduced .",
    "the diffraction - limited images ( resolution ( @xmath2 ) ) presented in this work highlight the presence of a prominent core emitting about 95% of the total flux in the mid - ir , as well as of extended emission , up to @xmath5 to the south - west ( pa = 210 ) and @xmath5 to the north - east ( pa = 35 ) , broken into patchy components which are particularly conspicuous at 20.5 @xmath0 m and can be singled - out as individual clouds . the central core shows an unresolved east - west fwhm of @xmath2 and a north - south fwhm of @xmath3 corresponding to a resolved full size extension of @xmath4 100 pc .",
    "the north - south elongation of the emission core agrees with predicted maps of the mid - ir emission from a 100 pc dusty / molecular torus surrounding the central engine in ngc1068 and observed under an inclination angle of around 65 . as a result of smaller optical depth",
    ", the extended emission in the north - east and south - west quadrants is more prominent at 20.5 than at 11.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "the extended emission follows roughly the direction of the radio - jet and radio - lobe structures . in the north - east quadrant",
    ", the mid - ir emission is located at the eastern edge of the ionizing cone outlined by the hst [ oiii]emitting clouds . interpreting the complete molecular / dusty environment of the agn , both in the torus and away from it , pleas for the development of three - dimensional complex modeling .",
    "high resolution imaging is the first step in disentangling the various components : the new generation of 8m10 m class telescopes provides a resolution of @xmath35 in the mid - ir .",
    "subsequent integral - field spectroscopy with such a spatial resolution and interferometry will also constitute invaluable tools to resolve this type of problem .",
    "we are gratefully indebted to r.jouan and m.lortholary for their efficient assistance with the camiras instrument , as well as to the staff at both eso / la silla and cfht / hawaii for their support during the observing runs .",
