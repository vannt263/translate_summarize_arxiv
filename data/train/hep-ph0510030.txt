    "searching for exotic particles whose structure can not be explained in the framework of the constituent quark model is at present a very lively subject of studies .",
    "one of their main streams concentrates on finding a firm evidence for the existence ( or absence ) of pentaquarks , with the lowest fock state containing @xmath1 quarks .",
    "this is particularly important in view of some contradictory results of experimental searches , reviewed at this conference by i.  strakovsky @xcite . because of the apparently very small decay width of pentaquarks ( @xmath2mev ) their theoretical description represents a big challenge , as discussed by m.  polyakov @xcite .",
    "another family of exotic particles which are at present a subject of intense studies are glueballs and hybrid mesons , for their review see , e.g. @xcite . the theoretical description of these particles requires to include in the lowest fock state the gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "all these facts stress the importance of studies of the structure of exotic particles within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) for understanding the mechanism of quark and gluon confinement .",
    "the hard exclusive electroproduction of particles permits to probe the structure of particles at the parton level .",
    "the scattering amplitude factorizes in this case into perturbatively calculable coefficient function , the non - perturbative distribution amplitude ( da ) of a produced particle and the non - perturbative generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) describing the transition probability amplitude of the target .",
    "the da and gpd encode full information about parton distribution inside particles participating in a collission , for a review see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "recently it was emphasized @xcite that hard electroproduction can also be used to reveal the partonic structure of exotic particles . in particular , for the processes involving pentaquarks @xmath3 as well as for their analogs with vector mesons @xmath4 , the necessary formalism based on the gpd of @xmath5 was developed which has permitted next to evaluate some contributions to the cross section in the born approximation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , realistic cross section estimates based on these expressions are not possible at the moment due to our ignorance of these @xmath5 gpds .",
    "another example of processes in which the partonic structure of exotic particles can be probed is supplied by the hard electroproduction of @xmath6 hybrid meson @xmath7 @xmath8 the process ( [ proces ] ) is the subject of recent studies in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",

    "analyse the particle spectrum ( including its exotic sector ) by construction of lowest - dimensional , gauge invariant , colorless _ local _ operators . as a result of this study a hybrid meson with exotic quantum numbers @xmath6",
    "is described by a _ local _ composite operator of dimension 5 built from quark and gluonic fields , e.g. @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the field strength tensor of a gluon .",
    "such local operator has a twist equal to 4 .",
    "naively one could think therefore that this result implies that the leading twist-2 da of a hybrid meson vanishes .",
    "consequently , the scattering amplitude for hard hybrid meson electroproduction would be suppressed ( at large photon virtuality @xmath11 ) in comparison with the amplitude for production in the same process of non - exotic @xmath12meson ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that this naive conclusion is not correct for longitudinally polarized hybrid meson for which the leading twist-2 da is not zero .",
    "thus , the electroproduction of such hybrid meson does nt need to be strongly suppresed in comparison with a @xmath12meson production .    the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite consists in exploiting the fact that das of particles are defined by a _ non local _ composite operators . in the case of a longitudinally polarised hybrid meson @xmath14 of momentum @xmath15",

    "this last property implies in particular that @xmath24 which means that the first term of the taylor expansion in @xmath25 of l.h.s of ( [ hybda ] ) vanishes and generally only terms with odd powers of @xmath25 contribute to this expansion @xmath26",

    "this proves that @xmath19 is non zero and allows to determine its value through non perturbative methods , such as , e.g. the qcd sum rules method @xcite : + a ) using the equations of motion one derives that @xmath39 + b ) the value of the coupling constant @xmath19 is determined by the correlator of two @xmath40 operators .",
    "+ this results in the estimate @xmath41    the description of the da of hybrid meson is complete by fixing the form of @xmath42 .",
    "this da satisfies usual non - singlet evolution equations and , forgetting the slowly varying logarithmic scaling violation factor , we assume in our estimates that it is given by the asymptotic expression @xcite : @xmath43 .",
    "knowing the da of the hybrid meson ( [ hybda ] ) one can determine the scattering amplitude at the leading order in strong coupling constant @xmath44 .",
    "the calculations proceed in a full analogy as in the @xmath45-meson case .",
    "the electroproduction process ( [ proces ] ) occurs in the scaling regime where the virtuality of the photon @xmath46 , see fig .  1 , is large and scales with the energy of the process , and the momentum transfer @xmath47 is small , @xmath48 . in such kinematics",
    "the conditions for the qcd factorization are fulfilled and the scattering amplitude at leading twist is at given factorisation scale @xmath49 expressed as a convolution @xmath50 of the da @xmath51 of meson , the gpd of the target nucleon @xmath52 and the perturbatively calculable coefficient function @xmath53 .",

    "@xmath58 only first terms of its perturbative expansion are at best known , the dependence of the amplitude @xmath64 on @xmath49 and @xmath54 can be large and leads to significant theoretical uncertainties of results .",
    "in order to minimalize this uncertainty a scale fixing procedure has to be invoked .",
    "inspired by results obtained in calculations of the pion form - factor we adapted the convention that both scales are equal , @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "fixing of the scale @xmath49 is then done by applying a modified version of the brodsky - lepage - mckenzie ( blm ) procedure : the scale @xmath49 is chosen in such a way which leads to a vanishing of large terms proportional to the @xmath66-function ( which governs the @xmath49-behaviour of the strong coupling constant @xmath67 ) in the square of the scattering amplitude known with at least the next - to - leading order accuracy , see @xcite for details . in more physical terms",
    "the blm procedure consists in absorbing numerically large terms originating from the renormalisation into redefinition of the argument of the strong coupling constant @xmath68 .",

    "thus a resonance with a @xmath70 decay mode for odd orbital angular momentum @xmath87 should be considered as an exotic meson .",
    "the mass region around @xmath89 @xmath90 is dominated by the strong @xmath91 resonance , it is therefore natural to look for the interference of the amplitudes of hybrid and @xmath92 production , resulting in the angular asymmetry in @xmath70 production",

    "a small amplitudes enters linearly rather than quadratically as in the cross section which increases chances for sizeable effects . in our case , since the hybrid production amplitude may be rather small with respect to a continuous background , we use the supposedly large amplitude for @xmath92 electroproduction as a magnifying lens to unravel the presence of the exotic hybrid meson .",
    "since these two amplitudes describe different orbital angular momentum of the @xmath82 and @xmath93 mesons , the asymmetry which is sensitive to their interference is an angular asymmetry defined by @xmath94 as a weighted integral over polar angle @xmath95 of the relative momentum of @xmath82 and @xmath93 mesons .",

    "the structure of this asymmetry is very natural : the first positive extremum is located at @xmath98 around the mass of @xmath99 meson while the second negative extremum corresponds to the hybrid meson mass .",
    "we advocate to use hard electroproduction to uncover the partonic structure of exotic particles . in the case of the exotic @xmath6 hybrid meson @xmath100 we presented quantitative estimates of the leading twist contribution to the electroproduction amplitude , which lead to sizeable effects .",
    "the resulting order of magnitude of cross section is smaller than the @xmath45 electroproduction but similar to the @xmath82 electroproduction .",
