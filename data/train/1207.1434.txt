    "the xrt data cover a relatively narrow energy range ( @xmath0kev ) of the spectrum of a typical sgr burst .",

    "@xcite found that the spectra of bat detected bursts can be well described by a single blackbody function with temperatures @xmath15kev .",

    "both modes provide the same spectral capabilities , however , the temporal resolution of the pc mode data is about 2.5s , too coarse for the very short ( @xmath20ms ) sgr bursts .",
    "therefore , we only employ here xrt observations performed in wt mode , because of its 1.7ms readout time well suited to the sgr burst durations .",

    "the trigger readout lasts for 600 s ( see * ? ? ? * for more details of the instrument and data types ) . using the same burst finding algorithm described in @xcite , we searched for triggered and un - triggered events from during the active periods of 2008 and 2009 . in total we identified 692 bursts out of which , 458 events had tte data .",
    "we only used nai detector tte data for our spectral analyses , as typical sgr bursts are not detected above 200kev , and last only for a fraction of a second .      to identify the events observed simultaneously with gbm and xrt , we compared the times of the 458 gbm bursts with the time intervals of the xrt observations in wt mode and found 87 common bursts .",

    "we found that , besides the five gbm saturated events , in ten other bursts the average readout time for central detection areas is smaller than 1.7ms , the smallest readout time for the wt mode .",
    "this indicates that these bursts are affected by the photon pile - up in the xrt data .",
    "compared to the remaining common events , these bursts have more photons in grades higher than 2 ; as a result an analysis of the data in the good grade range ( @xmath26 ) would lack most information and the results would be misleading .",
    "therefore , we also excluded these ten piled - up bursts from further investigations .",
    "the final outcome of all these filters was a selection of 42 bursts , observed with both gbm and xrt , that we then used for broadband spectral analysis ( 40 bursts detected on 2009 january 22 and 2 events on 2009 january 30 ) .",

    "these results indicate that the broadband joint fits can constrain better the physical emission model in sgr bursts as we discuss in section [ sec : joint - gbm ] .",

    "columns @xmath42 correspond to the temperatures of the two blackbody components , the luminosity and size of the emitting area for each blackbody component ( assuming a distance to of 5kpc ) , and the fit statistics of the bb@xmath17bb model fits .",

    "specifically , in the simplest theoretical constructs ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the index @xmath33 for a differential photon spectrum @xmath89 depends only on the magnetic compton @xmath90-parameter @xmath91 via @xmath92 . here",
    "@xmath93 is the mean number of scatterings per photon by the hot electrons , where @xmath94 is the effective optical depth for scattering , which in our case is modified by the strong magnetic field and thus dubbed the magnetic optical depth and denoted by @xmath95 .",
    "since we require the effective value of @xmath95 , one needs to calculate some rosseland - type mean opacity , averaged over photon angles and polarizations and accounting for the effects of the strong magnetic fields present , such as anisotropy and polarization - mode switching through scattering in non - uniform @xmath96 ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "this index is realized only in the energy range somewhat above the soft photon injection energy , @xmath97 , presumed to be surface thermal x - rays , and somewhat below the characteristic energy associated with the hot thermal electrons , in this case marked via the @xmath88 peak energy @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , the above relationship for @xmath98 requires the scattering to be in the thomson regime , and the mean photon energy to be lower than that of the electrons .",
    "it is evident that @xmath99 cases yield the flattest comptonized spectra with index around @xmath100 . the compt fit indices in table [ tab : gbm - xrt ] as well as its distribution in the left panel of figure [ fig : comptpar ] are nearly always harder than this , indicating that repeated compton upscattering has difficulty in generating the observed flat spectra .",
    "we note parenthetically , that this was also the case for around @xmath101 the bursts reported for sgrj0501@xmath174516 in @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of xrt data in the current work extends the spectral coverage to much lower energies thus enabling us to determine the value of @xmath33 significantly better than in previous works .",
    "this results in systematically higher values , corresponding to a harder spectral slope , with a mean value of @xmath102 instead of @xmath103 , which has made this problem worse .",
    "the fact that large @xmath98 is demanded in this fitting protocol would suggest high opacity and strong thermalization might be active in the burst emission region .",
    "in such cases , the above dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath104 and @xmath95 is not operable , and the comptonization is saturated , and described instead by a modified wien or modified bb spectrum ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the upscattered power - law photon population is generally substantially lower in total number relative to the seed surface x - ray population ( i.e. , it presents itself as an x - ray tail ) , a broadband spectral shape that is at odds with the spectral curvature inferred from the fits here .",
    "hence , there is no strong mandate to prefer a classical , unsaturated comptonization model for the bursts reported here .",
    "accordingly , the spectra might naturally be expected to exhibit more truly thermalized character , for example a two - blackbody or multi - blackbody signal emanating from a @xmath105 zone , possibly eliciting spectral distortion imposed by transport within the photosphere ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps this is what this broad band xrt / gbm analysis has enabled for a magnetar for the first time : the clear discrimination between compt and bb@xmath17bb spectral models .",
