    "the black hole thermodynamics is a challenging topic in black hole physics that has been studied for decades because of its non - perturbative , quantum nature .",
    "the phase diagrams of black holes exhibit rich structures that carry information about stability of these systems and , for that reason , have been attracting more attention and effort with time . among them , the van der waals - like behavior of black holes has been widely studied because of its striking similarity to the liquid - gas phase transition in the ordinary thermodynamic systems .",
    "the earliest analysis of first order phase transitions in black hole systems can be found in refs.@xcite , where the authors studied the inverse temperature - horizon diagram .",
    "it was found that , as the charge of black hole decreases to a critical value , the system undergoes a second - order phase transition , and below the critical charge , the black hole always presents first - order phase transition .",
    "this process is very similar to the one of the van der waals liquid - gas transition .",
    "later , by treating the negative cosmological constant as the pressure and the physical volume enclosed by the black hole horizon as its thermodynamical conjugated quantity , and identifying the black hole mass as enthalpy instead of internal energy , the black hole thermodynamic is re - studied in the extended phase space that includes the pressure and volume @xcite , and the first law agrees with the corresponding smarr relation @xcite .",
    "further , first attempts to study the phase structure in the pressure - volume , @xmath0-@xmath1 , diagram was made for the charged reissner - nrdstrom ( rn ) anti - de sitter ( ads ) black hole with fixed charge and the van der waals - like phase transition was observed in @xcite .",
    "namely , as the temperature increases , the black hole undergoes the first - order phase transition and then the second - order phase transition at the critical point , until it arrives at a stable phase .",
    "this proposal led to many generalizations in more general cases @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath2 criticality was discussed in a general framework , based on the smarr formula and the first law of thermodynamics , revealing its universality .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the phase structure of charged black holes in dimensionally continued gravity proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is a higher - dimensional lovelock ads theory which possesses a unique ads vacuum @xcite , so that the only parameters in the theory are the gravitational constant , @xmath3 , and the ads radius , @xmath4 . in particular",
    ", this theory becomes chern - simons ads gravity in odd dimensions @xcite and born - infeld ads gravity in even dimensions .",
    "the theory possesses topological black hole solutions whose properties and thermodynamics were studied in @xcite .",
    "a full boundary series of counterterms that renders dimensionally continued gravity finite in the ir region , is presented in ref.@xcite .    in this work",
    "we will focus on thermal phase transitions in the temperature - entropy , @xmath5-@xmath6 , plane in ordinary black hole phase space , rather than in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane in the extended space , for the following two reasons . on one hand , it was argued in @xcite that these two behaviors are dual to each other because both of them stem from the same equation , i.e. , the expression for the hawking temperature of the black hole .",
    "however , working in one side of the duality might be significantly simpler .",
    "for example , the maxwell s equal area law for charged ads black holes was possible to solve exactly in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane , whereas the solution was found only perturbatively around the critical values in the p - v plane @xcite .",
    "the van der waals - like phase transition in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane was also observed in @xcite and the references therein .    on the other hand , differently than in general relativity , the entropy of dimensionally continued black holes depends on both the horizon @xmath7 and the cosmological constant through @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to a highly non - linear expression for the pressure , making it technically very difficult to study phase diagrams in the extended phase space of such non - linear objects .",
    "in fact , it is much more convenient to analyze the phase structure in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane , where the parameter @xmath4 does not vary , expecting that its phase structure is similar to the one in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane due to the duality .",
    "let us also comment that , as nicely explained in a footnote of ref.@xcite , this conjectured duality of descriptions in two different planes is analogous to the t - duality of string theory , where the spectrum of a closed string wrapped around a compact dimension of some radius @xmath8 can be seen as the spectrum of a closed string wrapped around a compact dimension of the inverse radius , @xmath9 .",
    "the coupling constants in the corresponding dual theories are inverse to each other .",
    "similarly , in black hole thermodynamics , the state equation can be understood either as the hawking temperature @xmath5 for the black hole in a charged background , or as the pressure @xmath0 of a van der waals fluid enclosed in a ( specific ) volume @xmath1 and heated at the temperature @xmath5 .",
    "considering the former treatment means to focus on the @xmath5-@xmath6 phase space , while the latter treatment means to focus on the @xmath0-@xmath1 phase space .",
    "exchanging the roles of @xmath0 and @xmath5 is analogous to exchanging kaluza - klein momentum and winding modes in string theory .",
    "an inversion of a coupling constant due to the duality in black hole thermodynamics refers to the boltzman constant ( @xmath10 ) .    in dimensionally",
    "continued gravity , we find that the van der waals - like phase transition only occurs in black holes with spherical horizons in born - infeld ads gravity in even dimensions , and there are no such phase transitions in chern - simons ads gravity in odd dimensions . for the black holes that exhibit a van der waals - like behavior , our results show that the critical exponent near the critical point is consistent with that found in the mean field theory and the maxwell equal area law is satisfied for the first order phase transition .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - backround ] ,",
    "we briefly review dimensionally continued gravity and the charged , topological black holes .",
    "we discuss the existence of thermal phase transitions and their properties , such as critical exponents and the maxwell equal area law , in even dimensions in section [ sec - even - pt ] and odd dimensions in section [ sec - odd - pt ] , respectively .",

    "the maxwell equal area law has been checked to be satisfied at the first order phase transition point in first few even dimensions .",
    "we did not observe a van der waals - like phase transition in odd - dimensional black holes in the charged dimensionally continued gravity .",
    "it is important to mention that , at first sight , two families of dcg , chern - simons ads and born - infeld ads gravity , seem similar , but they are intrinsically different .",
    "first , chern - simons gravity comes from a chern - simons form , whose exterior derivative is a topological invariant . in contrast , born - infeld gravity does not have a geometric origin .",
    "furthermore , in comparison to all lovelock ads actions , chern - simons ads features a symmetry enhancement from local lorentz to local ads group , what drastically changes its dynamic structure and a number of local degrees of freedom .",
    "while all generic lovelock gravities have the same number of degrees of freedom as general relativity @xcite , even a pure lovelock @xcite which does not posses the linear in curvature term , this is no longer true for chern - simons gravity banados - garay - henneaux . from this point of view",
    ", it is not surprising that its phase space structure is drastically different than the one of born - infeld .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that , with the development of holographic duality , it was observed in @xcite that there also exists the van der waals - like phase transition in the entanglement entropy - temperature ( @xmath145-@xmath5 ) diagram by studying the holographic entanglement entropy ( see @xcite for review ) in a finite volume quantum system dual to a charged ads black hole with spherical geometry .",
    "more related studies in @xcite indicate that similar to thermal entropy , the entanglement entropy also presents the van der waals - like phase behavior .",
    "thus , it would be very interesting and important to explore the holographic entanglement entropy of the charged dimensional continued black holes , especially the one with spherical horizon in even dimensions , in which the van der waals - like phase transition in @xmath6-@xmath5 has been observed .",
    "we will address this question in the near future .",
