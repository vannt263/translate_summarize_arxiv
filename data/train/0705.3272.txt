    "the ` pile - up ' of wds at @xmath210 stems from the fact that once a am cvn wd - wd progenitor reaches contact , initially the mass transfer rates are high ( @xmath211 yr@xmath32 ) and the donor is rapidly exhausted of mass , thus it is rare to catch am cvn secondaries which are relatively massive ( @xmath212 ) . in the bottom panel",

    "thus , we artificially truncate the signal above 0.01 hz since we simply do not have a large enough number of startrack binaries above this frequency in order to accurately extrapolate them to the total number of galactic systems here .",

    "it immediately comes to attention that the bulge binaries ( green and mauve ; lower panel ) do not contribute to the gr signal above log(@xmath206 ) @xmath221 ( @xmath222 mhz ) for reasons discussed in  3.1 .",
    "also , the rlof binaries do not contribute to the signal at low frequencies ( below ( log(@xmath206)@xmath207 , @xmath223 mhz ) since these are binaries which have been in a state of rlof for a prolonged period of time , and are on very slowly expanding orbits ( largest orbital periods @xmath205 minutes ) .",
    "additionally , once the donor mass drops below 0.01 @xmath194 , we stop the calculation thus these very low - mass , low frequency systems do not contribute to the calculated _ lisa _ signal .",
    "the rlof disc signal ( blue ; lower panel ) becomes comparable to the detached disc signal ( red ; lower panel ) at frequencies above @xmath132 log(@xmath206)@xmath224 ( @xmath225 mhz ) . in our calculations , the am cvn binaries spend only a short period of time ( @xmath226 myr ) as detached double white dwarfs , where as they may spend @xmath132 gyr in the rlof phase .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the common envelope prescription that we have employed , and most am cvn systems go through a double ce ( cohe - r1 channel ) .",
    "the @xcite ce prescription with @xmath40 produces relatively close post - ce white dwarfs , and so it does not take long for the stars to be brought into contact via gravitational radiation once the detached double white dwarf has been formed .    in the upper panel , we show our combined signal ( grey ) and the median foreground ( white line ) alongside the astrophysical foreground estimates of @xcite and @xcite , both of which include detached and am cvn binaries .",
    "note that our foreground is significantly lower than the classic @xcite estimate at low frequencies , and is more comparable to the curve of @xcite in this regime ( see below ) .",
    "our foreground curve has been smoothed over 1000 bins , but some ` bumpiness ' still exists at higher frequencies due to low number statistics .",
    "in contrast to some previous studies where the signal has been truncated at higher frequencies , we show the curve over a significant portion of the lisa bandwidth ; up to 0.01 hz . since our original startrack binary population was scarcely populated at high frequencies , consequentially we could not generate smooth formation channel pdfs (  2.2 ) for high - frequency systems .",
    "our level of foreground signal is below that of @xcite for gr frequencies @xmath227 hz .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that at low frequencies , there is an overall lack of _ lisa _ binaries , since a large fraction of our _ lisa _ binary population are rlof systems and hence do not exist at the low end of the frequency spectrum .",
    "higher than ours . ]",
    "the median chirp mass of our double white dwarfs at frequencies below @xmath228 hz is @xmath229 m@xmath28 ( disc ) and 0.31 m@xmath28 ( bulge ) .    despite the large number of rlof systems in part of the low frequency , confusion - limited region of the galactic gravitational wave spectrum ( figure  [ dndfdisrlo ] and figure  [ dndfbulrlo ] ) , the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal at low frequencies",
    "is dominated by the detached double wds .",
    "mass - transferring binaries at the lower frequencies have undergone a significant amount of mass transfer , which leaves them with lower chirp masses than the detached binaries .",
    "as discussed previously , rlof systems do not occur with orbital periods greater than @xmath230 hours ( @xmath231 mhz ) .",
    "consequently the gravitational wave amplitude of the rlof systems ( both from the disc and from the bulge ) does not contribute very strongly to the overall foreground noise in the low - frequency regime .",
    "the gr amplitude from the bulge is smaller than that of the disc for both ( corresponding ) detached and rlof components of disc , primarily due to the fact that the stellar mass of the bulge is @xmath232 the mass of the disc , and contains fewer _ lisa _ double wds .",
    "the ` transition frequency ' is said to correspond to the gr frequency at which the gravitational wave spectrum transitions from confusion - limited to individually resolvable sources .",
    "the exact conditions which are necessary in order for this to occur ( one possibility would be when the average number of binaries per frequency bin drops below 1 ) are not completely clear .",
    "the addition of rlof systems to the detached population will increase the frequency at which the average number of binaries per bin drops below 1 , simply by adding more sources to the population .",
    "this is particularly so since rlof binaries are able maintain short orbital periods ( for longer then their detached counterparts ) once contact has been established .",
    "furthermore , as the transition frequency increases , the spread of the signal due to the motion of _ lisa _ also increases , thus the signals will continue to overlap at higher frequencies than might be inferred from a simple analysis of the number of binaries per resolvable frequency bin . for a simple detached system in a circular orbit whose orbital period is evolving solely due to the emission of gr , seven parameters are needed to fully characterize the signal .",
    "basic estimates from information theory describe how the limited amount of information in the _ lisa _ data stream can be mapped into an equivalent amount of information about detected binary systems .",
    "a common rule of thumb is the `` three - bin rule '' : at least three ( otherwise unpopulated ) frequency bins of _ lisa _ data are needed to resolve a seven - parameter binary source ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for a discussion ) .",
    "one can reasonably expect that a mass - transferring system will require more parameters to characterize the gr signal , and consequently more frequency bins to individually resolve the source .",
    "therefore , the average number of binaries per frequency bin is not a particularly good indicator of how the transition frequency changes with the addition of the rlof population .    for the sake of comparison with previous studies ,",
    "we have estimated the transition frequency using the 3-bin rule method .",
    "the point at which _",
    "lisa _ binaries _",
    "start _ to occupy one source per three frequency bins is found to be 1.5 mhz for the detached _ lisa _ binaries only , which is comparable to @xcite and @xcite , who found a transition frequency of @xmath233 mhz see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the inclusion of am cvn binaries in the confusion limit calculation ) .",
    "however we find that when we consider the entire _ lisa _ population of double wds , the transition frequency is increased to 2.4 mhz .",
    "we would like to however point out that these frequencies do not represent the frequencies above which one expects to resolve all _ lisa _ binaries ; there are still a number of populated bins at higher frequencies .    the 3-bin rule method of estimating the frequency at which binaries start to become resolved is not a robust method , since it is expected that at these higher frequencies , the frequency evolution due to mass transferring binaries can contribute a significant additional spreading of the signal .",
    "further , this method does not take into account important criteria such as doppler , phase and amplitude modulation , and one should consider alternative ( more technical ) methods in computing the threshold frequency region ( e.g. , chapter 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the following subsection",
    ", we discuss an approach other than the 3-bin rule of thumb to identify the population of resolved sources .",
    "instead of using a general estimator like the transition frequency , it is possible to use a predicted signal - to - noise ratio for any particular system to determine whether it is potentially resolvable or not ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .      for _ lisa _ observations of length @xmath234 the sensitivity to a particular binary source can be expressed by constructing a simple estimator of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . for circularized compact binaries",
    ", long observations will narrow the bandwidth of the source , and the binary will appear in the fourier spectrum as a narrow spectral feature with root spectral density @xmath235 , given in terms of the strain amplitude @xmath236 as @xcite @xmath237    _ lisa _ will detect binaries in the presence of competing sources of noise .",
    "there will be two components to the noise in _ lisa _ analysis : instrumental noise in the detector itself , and irreducible astrophysical noise from the total population of galactic close binaries .",
    "the instrumental component of the noise is given by the shape of the _ lisa _ sensitivity curve @xcite .",
    "in this work , the galactic foreground noise is computed from the synthesized galaxy itself ( i.e. , with startrack ) .",
    "the gravitational wave strength of every binary in the synthesized galaxy is estimated from its parameters , and a running median of the total signal is computed as a function of frequency . since the total number of individually resolved binaries is expected to be small compared to the total population , the running median should be a good estimate of the residual astrophysical noise foreground that would result from a fully realized science analysis procedure .",
    "the foreground resulting from this procedure has been shown in figure  [ spectra ] ( top panel ) .",
    "additionally , we have calculated the median foreground signal which is expected to arise from the unresolvable sources alone ( the ` reduced galaxy ' ) , which is likely a more realistic estimate of the true galactic foreground . in figure  [ curves ] , we show the galactic foreground alongside the galactic foreground signal minus the signal arising from the sources which were determined to be resolvable using our signal - to - noise estimate technique , assuming a snr ratio @xmath3 , ( see  4.3 ) . alongside our galactic foregrounds",
    "we show for comparison the standard _",
    "sensitivity curve as well as the average michelson noise of _ lisa_.",
    "the latter curve ( see  2.3 ) is a more appropriate comparison of the _ lisa _ instrumental noise with our calculated gravitational wave signal from the galactic binaries , as both curves ( our signal and the michelson noise ) account for directional and frequency dependencies of the wave as measured by _ lisa _ @xcite .",
    "the standard _",
    "sensitivity curve @xcite is often presented in the literature , and is an approximation of the spectral amplitude h@xmath238 scaled from the barycentred sensitivity amplitude h@xmath239 from the _ online sensitivity curve generator_.    the ultimate level of the confusion foreground ( and as a result , the ultimate snr of any given source ) will depend strongly on the actual data analysis algorithm used to identify and subtract sources .",
    "to date no fully realized implementation of such a procedure has been developed .",
    "the computed foreground shown here should be a good estimate to the output of a fully developed analysis procedure .      though millions of double wds are expected to be detected with _",

    "the estimate of the snr in eq.([simplesnr ] ) will not be precise in the regime where orbital periods change on timescales short compared to the observation time , or where the shape of the instrumental noise changes appreciably as a function of frequency .",

    "still , we note here that current estimates of the number of double wds with gr frequencies detectable with _",
    "are a factor of @xmath275 higher than those used in 1990 .    to populate the galaxy ( the disc only ) , @xcite used the density distribution @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the central density , @xmath278 and @xmath279 are galactocentric cylindrical coordinates , and @xmath280 and @xmath281 are the radial scale length and vertical scale height of the galactic disc , respectively .",
    "@xcite used @xmath282 pc in their study , and while though a reasonable assumption for the scale height of the thin disc , likely led to their ( too ) low estimate of double wds .",
    "more recently , it has been noted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the scale height for the binary population may be much higher ( @xmath283 pc ) than that used in @xcite .",
    "the @xcite curve is a modified result based on @xcite , who in calculating the gr amplitude in 1990 , used too low of a space - density estimate for double wds . in the original study of @xcite which neglected rlof systems , galactic double wds begin to dominate the gr amplitude at @xmath284 mhz , and",
    "continue to dominate until @xmath285 mhz , where the average number of sources per resolvable frequency bin drops below 1 ( similar results for the transition frequency were found in their study that included rlof systems ; @xcite ) .",
    "the analytical study of @xcite was not directly comparable to more recent studies of the _ lisa _ foreground which utilized more sophisticated techniques .",
    "@xcite performed a re - calculation of the analytical @xcite gr foreground for galactic binaries in order to compare the results directly to those of @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 10 ) .",
    "little was known about the true space density of double white dwarfs at the time of the @xcite study , and since @xcite was based on these results which underestimated the space density ( and hence total number ) of galactic white dwarf binaries , the @xcite study had a @xmath286% decrease in source density as compared to the study of @xcite .",
    "this reduction in number of systems resulted in a decrease in the foreground gr amplitude . until more recent observations of double white dwarfs were available to better constrain the space density @xcite , the error went undetected for some time , as this decrease was serendipitously counteracted by an increase in amplitude imposed by the ( too ) large double wd chirp masses used in the @xcite and @xcite studies . in short ,",
    "the studies of @xcite ( recalculated @xcite ) and @xcite have comparable foreground levels , albeit for different physical reasons .",
    "an increased number of observations of wd binaries since the time of the @xcite study [ ] nap04,and05 have confirmed that the ( lower ) wd masses used by @xcite coincide more closely with the masses of wds in binaries , where the masses used in @xcite do not ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for further discussion ) .    based on @xcite",
    ", @xcite used the criterion that the transition frequency occurs when the average number of binaries per bin drops below 1 , and they found the transition at @xmath285 mhz .",
    "they also found that @xmath287 detached double wds will be resolved with _",
    "lisa _ , assuming all systems above the _ lisa _ sensitivity limit ( a signal - to - noise of 1 ) are detectable . in their study which included am cvn systems , @xcite found a transition frequency closer to @xmath19 mhz , and that a total of @xmath288 galactic double wds ( half detached and half rlof ) would be resolvable .",
    "for a signal - to - noise ratio of 1 , we find that @xmath258 double white dwarfs with gr frequencies @xmath289 hz are potentially resolvable with _",
    "lisa_. however , in order to perform a reasonable comparison with @xcite , we need to consider only those binaries whose gr frequencies are above @xmath19 mhz ( and below 0.01 hz ; see  4 ) . in this case",
    ", we find that @xmath290 double white dwarfs may be resolvable with lisa .    in previous studies",
    ", it was assumed that the level of the galactic foreground will not contribute above the frequency at which the average number of sources per bin drops below 1 ( coined the ` transition frequency ' ) . since those studies do not calculate the gr signal beyond the transition frequency , above @xmath19 mhz their results can not be compared with ours .",
    "we find that the frequency at which the wd foreground drops below the instrumental noise level ( @xmath291 mhz ) is above the transition frequency which was found in previous studies .",
    "in contrast to previous work , it is expected that at higher frequencies ( @xmath8 mhz ) the rlof systems may contribute more significantly to the _ lisa _ signal than detached systems .",
    "this has implications for the ` transition frequency ' between unresolved and resolved systems : the transition frequency is shifted to higher frequencies with the addition of rlof systems .",
    "since we do not follow the evolution of non - degenerate stars in our _ lisa _ calculations , the binaries involving ` pre'-hydrogen wd donors ( i.e. , cvs ) are not shown on the figures , though we note they would make some contribution to the _ lisa _ data stream .",
    "we do not include the ` brown dwarfs ' in our lisa signal populations , though we note that binaries involving these brown dwarfs will not contribute significantly to the galactic gravitational wave background as these binaries have very low chirp masses . since the formation of such objects takes on average several gyr , it is however important to include them when considering very old stellar populations such as the galactic halo @xcite , where these systems comprise over @xmath292 % of the entire remnant binary population .",
    "in that work , it was found that the _ lisa _ gr signal from halo white dwarfs will be at least an order of magnitude below the signal arising from galactic ( disc@xmath14bulge ) white dwarf binaries .",
    "we have used the population synthesis binary evolution code startrack and the detailed _ lisa _ simulator of @xcite to calculate the gravitational wave foreground arising from close white dwarf binaries in the milky way disc and bulge .",
    "our population synthesis includes both detached and mass - transferring binaries , and it is found that the mass - transferring ( rlof ) binaries begin to contribute significantly to the foreground noise at high gr frequencies ( @xmath8 mhz , figure 10 bottom panel ) .",
    "our results are in general agreement with the analytical study of @xcite and the population synthesis study of @xcite for the low frequency regime : the _ lisa _ signal is dominated by detached binaries .",
    "however , in contrast to previous studies , it is found that , despite the fact that the ` transition frequency ' is found to be @xmath293 mhz using the 3-bin rule of thumb , at frequencies above @xmath294 mhz the presence of rlof binaries will likely make it difficult to resolve individual sources , and we find that the _ galactic foreground dominates the lisa noise up to at least @xmath295 mhz_. this is because the rlof binaries add to the total number of _ lisa _ systems at high frequencies , and at high frequencies the rlof systems chirp backward and spread out over more frequency bins , which offers a new set of challenges for _ lisa _ data analysts .",
    "the details of the true orbital period evolution due to mass transfer and possible tidal effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not well understood , and this uncertainty may impact the ability of future data analysis schemes to successfully resolve these systems .",
    "it is starting to become clear that such effects should be taken into account when studying the population of compact binaries @xcite .",
    "one new and interesting result of our study is the possibility that rlof systems which have recently entered the mass transfer phase ( small periods , higher chirp masses ) can add to the confusion foreground at higher frequencies than were previously predicted for the double white dwarf population .",
    "it should be repeated here that in this study , we employed one model prescription of ce evolution .",
    "this important phase of binary evolution may have a large impact on a synthesized stellar population , and various model prescriptions of ce may lead to a different number of galactic binaries and binary physical properties , which in turn affect the shape and strength of the _ lisa _ gr signal .",
    "the number of close ( _ lisa _ ) binaries could potentially be decreased if the ce efficiency is low ( more mergers ) or if angular momentum balance rather than energy balance is assumed during the ce phase .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that when an angular momentum balance prescription is adopted @xcite , post - ce orbital separations are overall larger , and fewer binaries will enter a cv - like rlof phase between a white dwarf and a main sequence star , which is a crucial step for some of the older ( bulge cohe - r2 ) _ lisa _ binaries .",
    "we have shown that there is a large population of potentially resolvable binaries in the galaxy .",
    "the approach of estimating resolvable systems described in  4.3 ( ` snr @xmath296 5 ' ) , relies on assuming that signals arising from individual binaries are separable , i.e. , can be demodulated using some sort of matched filtering technique ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references their - in ) .",
    "if detected , once their properties are measured these systems may aid to solve several remaining problems in binary evolution theory .",
    "especially interesting would be the detection of any double white dwarf binary with a mass close to or over the chandrasekhar mass ( potential sn ia progenitor or possible pre - ns accretion induced collapse object ) , or the measurement of the orbital periods of systems which have just emerged from a common envelope ( the phase that determines the formation of most compact object binaries ) . however , we reiterate that the detection of resolvable binaries will depend on the development of sensitive detection schemes and data analysis techniques .",

    "<S> however , we estimate that there still exists a sizeable number ( @xmath2 ) of galactic double white dwarf binaries which will have a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath3 , and thus will be potentially resolvable with _ lisa_. we present the _ lisa _ gravitational wave signal from the galactic population of white dwarf binaries , show the most important formation channels contributing to the _ lisa _ disc and bulge populations and discuss the implications of these new findings . </S>"
