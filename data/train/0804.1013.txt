    "it has anomalous spiral arms of @xmath1 emission @xcite in the inner regions which are symmetric with respect to the nucleus .",
    "this emission is probably from shocks formed where the matter ejected from the nucleus meets the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "masers are the microwave equivalent of lasers",
    ". water vapour maser emission at a wavelength of @xmath2 provides information about the accretion discs around highly compact objects in the centres of active galaxies .",
    "masers are bright where there is no gradient in the bulk line - of - sight velocity @xcite . in",
    "a nearly edge - on keplerian accretion disc the strongest features occur along the line to the disc centre where the disc is moving perpendicular to the line of sight , these are the systemic masers",
    ". we also see masers where the plane of the sky intersects the disc , these are the high - velocity masers",
    ".    masers were first detected in the galaxy ngc 4258 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the structure and dynamics of these discs can be accurately probed with very long baseline interferometry because the emission lines are strong and intrinsically narrow .",
    "ngc 4258 has a set of masers that might trace out a warped accretion disc which is seen nearly edge on @xcite .",
    "radio interferometry has shown that their rotation is keplerian @xcite and that the disc extends from @xmath3 to @xmath4 from the nucleus .    at its distance of @xmath5 , in the plane of the sky we have the scaling @xmath6 .",
    "the keplerian rotation of the high velocity masers implies an enclosed mass of @xmath7 within @xmath3 of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a central supermassive black hole .    on a scale of milliarcseconds",
    "the central core breaks up into a jet oriented along the axis of the water maser disc @xcite .",
    "the northern jet has a flux of @xmath8 and its mean location is about @xmath9 north ( in the plane of the sky ) of the implied position of the black hole which is the centre of the rotation of the masers .",
    "however the jet position varies in time .",
    "the southern jet has not varied in flux or position and is located about @xmath10 south of the black hole position .",
    "it has a flux of @xmath11 .",
    "the free - free absorption in the masing disc causes the difference in brightness between the jets @xcite .",
    "the position angles of the jets are poorly determined .",
    "we estimate the northern jet is at a position angle of @xmath12 measured from @xcite .",
    "the jets do not appear to be very well aligned with each other and the southern jet is at a position angle of about @xmath13 .",
    "on larger scales the jet appears to be orientated north - south @xcite .",
    "the systemic masers are about @xmath14 below the disc centre as indicated by the high velocity masers @xcite and at a disc radius of @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the masers at the inner edge of the disc suggest that it is inclined at an angle of @xmath16 to the plane of the sky",
    ". there appears to be no structure to the vertical positions of the masers in the disc and so the disc is probably thin @xcite .",
    "masers operate when the temperature of the surface layers in the disc is greater than @xmath17 but less than @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the outer edge of the disc is where the molecular to atomic transition occurs , just outside the outer maser .",
    "the reason for the apparent inner edge of the maser disc is not yet known .",
    "the high - velocity masers and are not colinear with the systemic masers and have negligible accelerations @xcite .",
    "the radial dependence of declination with respect to the systemic velocity of ngc 4258 is anti - symmetric in the the red and blue - shifted masers @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the rotation axis of the disc varies with radius by an angle of up to @xmath19 radians @xcite and so the disc is warped .",
    "@xcite found that the maser spots show a deviation from keplerian rotation of about @xmath20 .",
    "they modelled this with a warped keplerian accretion disc with a radial gradient in its inclination of @xmath21 .",
    "there are several suggested explanations for the origin of the warp in the disc . @xcite",
    "considered some mechanisms for the warping and precession of galactic accretion discs .",
    "@xcite showed that it could be produced by a binary companion orbiting outside the maser disc .",
    "such a companion would need a mass comparable to that of the disc but there is no observational evidence for it .",
    "a second suggestion is that radiation pressure from the central black hole produces torques on a slightly warped disc and the warp grows @xcite .",
    "however the masing disc is stable against this radiation instability if @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 is the viscosity parameter @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in the absence of other torques , @xcite concluded that the warping in the disc of ngc 4258 is due to the bardeen - petterson effect .",
    "if we have an accretion disc around a misaligned spinning black hole , lense - thirring precession drives a warp in the disc .",
    "the inner parts of the disc are aligned with the black hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the warp radius in the disc is comparable to or smaller than the radius of the inner masers .",
    "they find the timescale of alignment of the system to be a few billion years .",
    "they based their work on the results of @xcite who assumed that the surface density is constant .",
    "we use the more realistic power law surface density and viscosities described by @xcite .",
    "we fit these analytical disc models , warped by the lense - thirring effect to the shape of the observed maser distribution .",
    "in this section we consider some properties of accretion discs .",
    "we assume that we have a steady state disc where @xmath24 and that the surface density is a power law @xmath25 @xcite . to be in steady state , the viscosity must obey @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants and @xmath30 is some fixed radius .    according to @xcite the thickness of the disc in the gas pressure dominated region has @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this is well approximated by @xmath34const for @xmath35 . for ngc 4258 @xmath36 which is much smaller that the inner edge of the disc at @xmath3 and so we assume that @xmath37 in our work .",
    "there are two viscosities : @xmath38 corresponds to the azimuthal shear ( the viscosity normally associated with accretion discs ) and @xmath39 corresponds to the vertical shear in the disc which smoothes out the twist .",
    "the second viscosity acts when the disc is non - planar .",
    "we assume that the second viscosity obeys the same power law as @xmath38 so @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a constant .",

    "this means that the disc must be effectively of infinite mass because it is continually supplied with matter .",
    "seyfert outbursts are stochastic randomly - orientated , short - lived accretion events .",
    "if this system is a seyfert system then the maser disc is just the outer regions of a disc generated by an accretion event .",
    "seyfert episodes thought to be shorter than @xmath255 @xcite and nuclei evolve through at least 100 of these .",
    "the disc becomes stable and thin in a few orbital periods , a time of around @xmath256 at the outer edge of the disc .",
    "the warp then just represents the distribution of angular momentum in the accreted matter .",
    "the time to change the warp , around @xmath257 , is much longer than the length of the seyfert outburst and the typical time to the next outburst .",
    "it is hard to reconcile our model without upsetting this understanding of seyfert outbursts .",
    "however ngc4258 is a rather inactive agn .",
    "the assumed luminosity is well below the eddington luminosity .",
    "we suggest that it could be in a more quiescent phase with steady accretion .",
    "we can fit the shape of the warped disc in ngc 4258 with steady state accretion disc which has a misaligned spinning black hole that causes the disc to warp by lense - thirring precession .",
    "we need the angle between the black hole and the outer disc to be greater than @xmath258 in order to get a good fit .",
    "we need the warp radius to be @xmath259 .",
    "we need the angular momentum of the outer disc to be at an angles of less than @xmath260 to the plane of the sky .",
    "the black hole spin must be close to the plane of the sky to see masers .",
    "the best fitting model has the warp radius at @xmath261 and a black hole position angle of @xmath262 but this disc would be unstable to self gravity .",
    "the best fitting model which would not be self gravitating has @xmath239 but the position angle of the black hole is @xmath263 .",
    "the observed direction of the jet is @xmath264 and so can not be easily accounted for using this model .",
    "we need the disc to be very long lived in order for it to become warped in its lifetime . if the disc was in steady state all the way in , it would be unstable against self - gravity",
    ". the requirements of the model are hard to fit with our understanding of seyfert outbursts which are thought to last only @xmath255 .",
    "however , it remains that we can fit the observed maser distribution with an accretion disc warped by lense - thirring precession remarkably well .",
    "i thank jim pringle for many useful discussions and reading the manuscript and christopher tout for help with statistics and other useful discussions .",
    "i thank alice argon and jim moran for advice about the maser observations and anderson caproni and lincoln greenhill for useful comments ."
