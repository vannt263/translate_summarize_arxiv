    "the so  called proton spin crisis is still calling for a theoretical explanation in the context of qcd .",
    "the problem may be stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be the singlet axial current @xmath1 its on  shell nucleon matrix element may be written as @xmath2 u(\\mbox{\\boldmath{$p$ } } ' , s ' ) , \\label{form1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 . in the naive parton model @xmath4 can be interpreted as the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by the quarks , and so is expected to be close to 1 . on the contrary , experimental determinations @xcite lead to a value @xmath5 , which is also in contrast with the ozi expectation @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "it is the small experimental value of @xmath7 which is referred to as the proton spin crisis .",
    "a numerical simulation on the lattice is the ideal nonperturbative tool to obtain an estimate of @xmath7 from first principles .",
    "a direct computation of the matrix element of eq . ( [ form1 ] ) involves the evaluation of a disconnected diagram , characterized by a very noisy signal @xcite .",
    "we shall adopt a different method @xcite , which makes use of the axial anomaly @xmath8 @xmath9 is the number of flavours and @xmath10 is the topological charge density .",
    "the on  shell nucleon matrix element of @xmath11 can be written , using eq .",
    "( [ anom ] ) , as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the nucleon mass and @xmath14 , whence @xmath15 .",
    "the last relation does not hold in the quenched approximation , since @xmath16 develops a pole at @xmath17 in that case  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 can be calculated on the lattice by evaluating the nucleon matrix element of the topological charge density @xmath11 in full qcd . however , a necessary condition to do this is to have the correct sampling of topological modes . here",
    "we will give some preliminary results obtained using the standard hmc algorithm with four flavours of dynamical staggered flavours and will show that the feasibility of the determination is affected by the bad sampling of topological modes obtained with the hmc algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we have simulated four degenerate flavours of staggered fermions at @xmath18 on a @xmath19 lattice , using the standard hmc algorithm described in ref . @xcite and the wilson action for the pure gauge sector .",
    "a trajectory length @xmath20 was used , with time step @xmath21 .",
    "the value @xmath22 was chosen for the fermion mass .    in order to evaluate the matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ form2 ] ) we need a lattice regularization @xmath23 of the topological charge density .",
    "the renormalization properties of @xmath23 are nontrivial  @xcite : it mixes with the continuum @xmath11 , @xmath24 as well as with @xmath25 .",
    "however , it can be shown that the last two operators can be safely neglected in a first approximation  @xcite , so that the following relation holds @xmath26    we use the improved smeared operators @xmath23 proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in particular the operator defined at the second smearing level .",
    "the value of @xmath27 can be obtained non  perturbatively using the so  called heating method @xcite : the short range fluctuations responsible for the renormalization are thermalized by applying a few updating steps on a discretized classical configuration of charge 1 .",
    "the thermalization shows up as a plateau in @xmath28 plotted against the number of heating steps performed , as is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "@xmath27 is then measured on this plateau .",
    "we have obtained @xmath29 with the values of the parameters used in our simulation .",
    "0.3 cm    the next step is to compute the correlation function @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the spin projection operator .",
    "for @xmath33 we have taken the wall source , after performing a coulomb gauge fixing on the @xmath34 time slice by means of a steepest  descent algorithm .",
    "for @xmath35 we have taken the usual local baryon operator  @xcite @xmath36    the following behaviour is expected for @xmath37  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be determined by a fit to the full baryon propagator @xmath41  @xcite . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the axial baryonic charge and mass of the @xmath44(1405 ) particle respectively  @xcite .",
    "we have collected a sample of 230 configurations , each separated by 15 hmc trajectories , using 700 hours of a 25 gflops ape / quadrics machine .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the topological charge distribution in our sample .",
    "it is clear that the correct thermalization for the topological charge has not yet been achieved : @xmath45 and the distribution is not symmetric under @xmath46 . the time history of the topological charge is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where the inefficiency of the hmc algorithm to change the topological sector is clearly visible .    despite this deficiency in our ensemble of configurations ,",
    "we have attempted an estimate of @xmath7 and @xmath47 . from a fit to the full baryon propagator we have obtained @xmath48 we have thereafter measured the correlation function of eq .",
    "( [ correl ] ) .",
    "the zero momentum transfer limit has been approximated by using @xmath49 ( @xmath50 mev on our lattice ) .",
    "an average has been performed over the three possible spatial directions for @xmath51 and over the two possible polarizations .",
    "the error analysis has been done by a jackknife method .",
    "however , the error quoted in eq .",
    "( [ results ] ) does not take account of the systematic error coming from the bad sampling of topological modes . by looking at the effective number of topological sectors explored during the simulation ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we roughly estimate the effective error to be up to 45 times the one quoted in eq .",
    "( [ results ] ) .",
    "therefore our data can only be regarded as preliminary and no conclusive results can be produced unless a correct sampling of topological modes is obtained .",
    "this goal seems to be hardly feasible for the standard hmc algorithm : the possibility of achieving it by using different algorithms is currently under investigation .",
