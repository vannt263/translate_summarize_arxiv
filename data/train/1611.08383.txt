    "then by definition it belongs to @xmath244 thus such exterior points can not exist .",
    "we note that the fractal arc @xmath208 is invariant under the reflection @xmath251 at the line @xmath252 to see this , we check that for each point connecting two quadrilaterals in the approximating chain of @xmath208 on some level @xmath170 , the reflected point will also be on two quadrilaterals , at least on level @xmath253 for @xmath254 and @xmath255 this can be seen in figure [ g1 ] . by induction",
    "we prove that _ all _ vertices of the quadrilaterals within @xmath256 lie on @xmath257 they form a reflection symmetric set .    as a consequence",
    ", the neighbor map @xmath258 describes the same boundary set @xmath208 as @xmath235 on one hand @xmath259 implies that @xmath260 contains @xmath257 on the other hand , points in @xmath261 fulfil @xmath262 and do their images under @xmath263 so that @xmath260 can not contain other points of @xmath11    now @xmath250 and all boundaries between the pieces @xmath134 form a network of jordan curves which belong to @xmath12 because the edge neighbor maps within @xmath43 are @xmath264 and @xmath265 we can apply the @xmath133 to the union of all these jordan curves and get a more dense network of jordan curves bounding the second level pieces and forming a subset of @xmath11 the diameter of holes within this network is at most @xmath266 iterating further , the diameter of holes tends to zero .",
    "thus the closed set @xmath7 contains the whole interior region of @xmath244    once we know that @xmath7 is homeomorphic to a disk , we immediately have the open set condition and the tiling property . for topological reasons , disk - like neighbors can only meet in a jordan arc or in a single point .",
    "so all remaining neighbors of @xmath7 are point neighbors .",
    "as mentioned above , this implies the finite type property .",
    "since we had a graph - directed system with open set condition , the calculation of the dimension @xmath110 in section 2 is justified .",
    "the computer - free proof of the theorem is finished .",
    "@xmath79    _ completion of proof of proposition [ p1 ] .",
    "_ we know that @xmath7 is homeomorphic to a disk , and the neighbors @xmath267 and @xmath268 intersect @xmath7 in the fractal arcs @xmath269 and @xmath270 respectively .",
    "this immediately implies that the long side @xmath82 is invariant under @xmath93 rotation @xmath186 and that @xmath271 is mapped by @xmath95 rotation @xmath187 onto @xmath257 reflection - invariance of @xmath208 was shown above .",
    "the congruence of @xmath208 with the fractal arc @xmath272 and of @xmath271 with @xmath273 is given by the neighbor maps @xmath274 and @xmath275 see figure [ f3 ] .",
    "this proves the corresponding statements a)c ) for @xmath69 the argument of d ) was justified above , and e ) is based on the neighbor map @xmath183 and the reflection invariance of @xmath257 everything is proved .",
    "the union of pieces 2 and 3 in figure [ f1 ] has the symmetry group of a rectangle .",
    "it is mapped to itself by the @xmath93 rotation @xmath276 and also by reflection @xmath277 at the line @xmath252 this kind of symmetry is rare in fractal tiles .",
    "we apply the reflection to @xmath278 and @xmath279 obtaining new maps @xmath280 since @xmath281 there is a new reptile with maps @xmath282 as a set , this reptile coincides with @xmath12 but the subdivision is different , as shown in figure [ f22 ] .",
    "this leads to other tilings .",
    "reflection of a rectangle consisting of two pieces in a self - similar triangle was radin s trick to come from a crystallographic tile to the non - crystallographic pinwheel triangle .",
    "a similar trick was used by conway and radin @xcite to obtain three - dimensional quaquaversal tilings from crystallographic ones . in our case , however the reflection of pieces 2,3 leads from one non - crystallographic tile to another non - crystallographic tile .",
    "the second subdivision of this fractal structure is shown in figure [ f22 ] .",
    "four of the mappings @xmath133 are orientation - reversing .",
    "all three vertices of the fractal triangle are fixed points of corresponding contraction maps , resulting in a smaller number of point neighbors .",
    "the graph of edge neighbors is planar , as shown in figure [ nbg2 ] .",
    "this second similarity structure has quite different matching rules than the first .",
    "the irrational rotations in the last row of figure [ f3 ] do not appear as neighbors maps .",
    "instead , we have the glide reflections shown in figure [ f32 ] .",
    "an irrational rotation occurs between point neighbors , as for the pinwheel triangle : @xmath283 has the form @xmath284 with @xmath285 in _ both _ structures . part",
    "a ) of the following statement is proved like theorem [ t ] .",
    "c ) follows from the graph in figure [ nbg2 ] .          1 .",
    "there are exactly 11 edge neighbors , given in the first two rows of figure [ f3 ] and in figure [ f32 ] .",
    "their graph is shown in figure [ nbg2 ] .",
    "there are 35 point neighbors and no other neighbors .",
    "thus @xmath7 is finite type , has non - empty interior and is a reptile .",
    "point neighbor maps include irrational rotations .",
    "so there are no lattice tilings , and we have statistical circular symmetry .",
    "edges come with two types of maps : rational rotations on one hand , glide reflections on the other .",
