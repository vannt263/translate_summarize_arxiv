    "heavy quark production in photon - photon collisions reveals the structure of a fundamental gauge boson , the photon .",
    "it can be calculated in perturbative qcd and is sensitive to the quark and gluon content of the photon . at lep2 energies",
    "the two main processes , direct and single - resolved , have approximately the same contribution , while the double - resolved contribution is negligible .    charm production in photon - photon collisions can be cleanly tagged e.g.  by the full reconstruction of charged @xmath1 mesons , while bottom production can be measured through a careful study of the various sources of final state leptons in hadronic two - photon events .",
    "we present a preliminary update on the measurement of @xmath1 production in anti - tagged photon - photon collisions  @xcite .",
    "the main change compared to the previous analysis is the inclusion of data collected by opal in 1999 at @xmath2  centre - of - mass energies @xmath3 , bringing the total integrated luminosity to @xmath4 in the centre - of - mass energy range @xmath5 gev with a luminosity - weighted average energy of @xmath6 .     for the full sample .",

    "the charge - conjugate decay chain is used for @xmath13 mesons .",
    "the distribution of the mass difference between the @xmath1 and the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , for the combined data set is shown in figure  [ fig - signal ] .",
    "background is subtracted by fitting the function @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are free parameters and @xmath19 is the pion mass , to the combined upper sideband of the signal and the wrong - charge distribution in the range @xmath20 .",
    "the result of the fit is in good agreement with the wrong - charge combination in the signal region . in total",
    "we observe @xmath21 @xmath1 mesons .    according to the pythia monte carlo program",
    "the @xmath1 selection efficiencies for the transverse momentum and rapidity range of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are around @xmath24 for the 3-prong and @xmath25 for the 5-prong decay modes in single - resolved and direct events .",
    "the approximately 6% lower efficiency compared to the published analysis is due to additional electron rejection cuts which significantly improve the purity of the signal .",
    "two methods are used to determine the relative fraction of direct and single - resolved events in the data sample .",
    "one is based on @xmath26 , defined in two - jet events using the cone algorithm as the minimum of @xmath27 , while the other uses the scaled @xmath1 transverse momentum @xmath28 , available in all events .",
    "the results of both methods are shown in figure  [ fig - xgamma ] .",
    "the ratio of direct to single - resolved contributions in the dijet events determined by a fit to the @xmath26 distribution yields @xmath29 direct and @xmath30 single - resolved , while the fit to the @xmath31 distribution yields @xmath32 direct and @xmath33 single - resolved contributions , where all errors are statistical only .",

    "the selection of open beauty events proceeds in three steps .",
    "first , anti - tagged photon - photon events are selected . within these events ,",
    "muon candidates are reconstructed as a signature for semileptonic beauty decays . finally , jets are reconstructed within the selected events , and the transverse momentum of the muon candidates with respect to the axis of the closest jet is computed .    an artificial neural network trained for muon identification  @xcite",

    "at least one jet with a transverse energy @xmath52 with respect to the beam axis greater than @xmath53  gev and at least three tracks is required .",
    "after this final cut @xmath54  events remain in this b - enriched sample .",
    "four contributions to the @xmath51 distribution have to be taken into account : hadronic photon - photon interactions with open b production , open c production , the remaining hadronic photon - photon interactions ( labelled ` uds ' ) and processes other than hadronic photon - photon interactions ( labelled ` bg ' ) .         [ fig - ptmuon ]    the number of b events is determined by a fit to the @xmath51 distribution after all the other contributions have been fixed .",
    "the previous opal measurement of open charm production  @xcite is used to fix the absolute contributions of open c production via the direct and single - resolved processes , where the shape is given by the pythia monte carlo program .",
    "most of the muons found in the uds background are due to decays of pions and kaons into muons , therefore the rate of pion and kaon production is measured separately . a b - depleted sample of photon - photon events is selected with @xmath55 and with pion and kaon identification using @xmath56 measurements .",
    "the transverse momentum relative to the jet axis for the charged hadrons in this b - depleted sample , @xmath57 , shown in figure  [ fig - ptpion ]  ( left ) , was used to find the scaling factor of @xmath58 for the phojet monte carlo cross - section .",

    "the final result of the one - parameter fit to the b - enriched sample , shown in figure  [ fig - ptmuon ]  ( right ) , yields a beauty fraction @xmath66 with @xmath67 ( ndf=7 ) , corresponding to @xmath68 events .",
