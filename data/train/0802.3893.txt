    "the history of the cosmological reionisation is one of the open problems of modern cosmology .",
    "questions like what causes the reionisation and how it proceeds are intimately related to the evolution of matter density fluctuations and to the formation of the first structures @xcite .",
    "the lack of observational data makes it quite difficult to answer these questions today .",
    "up to now , the available probes of the reionisation epoch are just a few , e.g. the gunn - peterson test @xcite and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , in particular its polarisation @xcite .",
    "the observation of the gunn - peterson effect , which probes the amount of neutral hydrogen , suggests that full reionisation was accomplished by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the cmb polarisation , in turn , measures the optical depth of the thomson scattering from the last scattering surface to the present epoch .",
    "the wmap 3 years data provide an optical depth @xmath2 @xcite suggesting that reionisation began around @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to those two probes , the observation of fluctuations of the 21  cm line background is expected to be one of the most promising methods to study reionisation @xcite .",
    "the 21  cm line corresponds to the energy of the hyperfine spin flip transition of neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "after decoupling of the baryon temperature from the cmb temperature around @xmath4 , neutral hydrogen atoms absorb or emit a 21  cm line , depending on their temperature .",
    "since the 21  cm line is redshifted by the cosmological expansion , we can obtain redshift slices of the universe by choosing the frequency of observation .",
    "it is thus possible to follow the evolution of the intergalactic medium before and during reionisation directly .",
    "the 21  cm line observations have recently gained a lot of attention @xcite and several projects are designed for measuring the fluctuating line background ( e.g. mwa , lofar , ska ) .    in the near future",
    ", we will therefore have different direct and complementary probes of reionisation .",
    "we thus expect that cross - correlations between them will provide even more information than their respective auto - correlations .",
    "this is the case especially for the cross - correlation between the cmb temperature anisotropies and the 21  cm line fluctuations on large scales ( @xmath5  * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and on small scales ( @xmath6  * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the observations of the 21  cm lines are expected to be dominated by foregrounds and noise @xcite , calculating the cross - correlation is indeed a good way to extract information on reionisation . in particular on large scales ,",
    "the 21  cm line fluctuations are correlated with the cmb doppler temperature anisotropies which are due to the motion of ionised baryons .",
    "@xcite showed that the maximum amplitude of the cross - correlation is reached at the redshift when the ionised fraction is one half , which potentially provides a way to constrain double reionisation models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    in the present study",
    ", we examine the cross - correlation between the cmb @xmath0-mode polarisation ( a more effective probe than the temperature anisotropies ) and the fluctuations of the 21  cm line background on large scales .",
    "measuring @xmath0-mode polarisation is one of the present challenging observations for cmb experiments .",
    "however , projects like planck and cmb - pol will provide precise cmb polarisation maps in the near future .",
    "similarly , cosmological observation of 21 cm line background is still belongs to the future , but lofar and mwa are being completed and will soon provide us with maps of neutral hydrogen at high redshifts .",
    "hence , it is useful to investigate what information on reionisation we can extract from the cross - correlation of those maps .",
    "indeed , we show here that the cross - correlations are a potentially powerful tool to constrain the history of cosmic reionisation .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we provide the analytic formula of the cross - correlation between the cmb @xmath0-mode polarisation and the fluctuations of the 21  cm line background . in sec .",
    "iii , we show and discuss the results of the cross - correlation .",
    "vi is devoted to the conclusions . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use wmap 3-year values for the cosmological parameters , i.e. @xmath7 , @xmath8k , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite for a flat cosmology . we also set the speed of light to @xmath11 .",
    "the cmb polarisation is best described by the stokes parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "since the stokes parameters have spin 2 , they can be decomposed onto the plane waves and spin-2 spherical harmonics @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 here , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 correspond to the scalar , vector and tensor types . in this paper , we only consider @xmath16 modes , because they dominate other polarisation modes at the scales we are interested in .",
    "the cmb polarisation components , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are obtained from the boltzmann equations for cmb . according to those , @xmath20 = 0 for all @xmath21s and the evolution of @xmath19",
    "is given by the following integral solution , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath16 source term due to thomson scattering , @xmath24 is the differential optical depth for thomson scattering in conformal time , given by @xmath25 with the electron number density @xmath26 , the cross section of thomson scattering @xmath27 and the scale factor @xmath28 normalised to the present epoch , and @xmath29 is the optical depth between the conformal times @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the source term @xmath23 is related to the initial gravitational potential @xmath32 via the transfer function @xmath33 , @xmath34 we provide the detailed calculation of the transfer function in the appendix .",
    "we also define the @xmath0-modes in the direction @xmath35 on the sky by @xmath36      the observed brightness temperature of the 21  cm lines in a direction @xmath35 and at a frequency @xmath37 is given as in @xcite by @xmath38 here , the conformal time @xmath39 refers to the redshift @xmath40 that satisfies @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the frequency corresponding to the 21  cm wavelength .",

    "the cosmological linear perturbation theory provides the relation between the baryon density fluctuations and the initial gravitational potential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the transfer function of baryons .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath70 can thus be written in terms of the initial power spectrum of the gravitational potential @xmath75 as @xmath76 although the reionisation process is not well - known , we can reasonably expect that there is a relation between the fluctuations of the ionised fraction and that of the matter density .",
    "ionising sources are formed in dense regions .",
    "they ionise the surrounding medium with an efficiency that depends on the density of the medium .",
    "this translates into two possible cases : one where ionised fluctuations and matter over - densities coincide , and one where ionised fluctuations and matter density are anti - biaised ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the fluctuations of the ionised rate are associated with the matter density contrast using the press - schechter description @xcite .",
    "as a result , the power spectrum @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 d_{\\rm m}(k , \\eta ) k^2 p_{\\phi},\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the transfer function of matter ( both dark and baryonic ) , @xmath80 is the average bias of dark matter halos more massive than @xmath81 , the minimum mass of the source of ionising photons @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the variance of the density fluctuations smoothed with a top - hat filter of the scale corresponding to a mass @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the fraction of matter collapsed into halos with @xmath86 . in this paper , we choose @xmath81 such that the halo virial temperature is @xmath87 k. this choice corresponds to the assumption that the ionising sources form in dark matter halos where the gas cools efficiently via atomic cooling .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 describes the reionisation regime we are interested in . for @xmath89 , we are in the `` photon - counting limit '' case where recombinations are not important and where the progress of the reionisation depends on the number of ionising photons only .",
    "the over - dense regions contain more collapsed objects which are sources of ionising photons .",
    "therefore , in this case , ionisation in over - dense regions is easier than in under - dense regions . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath90 indicates the ",
    "strmgren limit \" case where ionisation is balanced by recombination .",
    "although the over - dense regions contain more sources of ionising photons , the recombination rate in over - dense regions is higher than in under - dense regions .",
    "hence , over - dense regions in the @xmath90 case have a lower ionised fraction than in the @xmath89 case ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    finally , in order to calculate eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross - cl ] ) , we need the evolution of the mean neutral hydrogen fraction for which we use a simple parameterisation based on two key quantities , the reionisation epoch ( defined as the redshift at which the ionised fraction equals 0.5 ) , @xmath91 , and the duration of reionisation , @xmath92 ,    @xmath93}. \\label{eq : xh}\\ ] ]    in the following we will vary both @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and investigate their effect on the cross - correlation signal .",
    "as one can see in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross - cl ] ) , the angular power spectrum @xmath94 of the cross - correlation is a function of several key parameters that encode the prominent details of the reionisation history .",
    "consequently , and as we show here , the global shape of the @xmath94 as well as the amplitude and redshift dependence of its first peak are features that can be traced back to the reionisation characteristics .",
    "first it is worth noting that because of the double integration of the spherical bessel functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross - cl ] ) , the angular power spectrum reflects the source term @xmath95 , namely the quadrupole term of the cmb temperature anisotropy , at @xmath96 where @xmath97 satisfies @xmath98 .",
    "accordingly , the angular power spectrum of the cross - correlation exhibits its first peak at a multipole @xmath99 which corresponds to the angular separation of the quadrupole at @xmath96 .",
    "the oscillations at higher @xmath21s ( @xmath100 ) are due to the free streaming of the quadrupole at redshifts higher than @xmath40 .",
    "we first investigate the effect of the duration of reionisation @xmath92 .",
    "we present in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clre10 ] three cases : one corresponding to a instantaneous reionisation @xmath101 and two with longer durations ( @xmath102 and 2 ) .",
    "we compute the angular spectra of the cross - correlation between 21  cm line fluctuations and the cmb @xmath0-mode fluctuations for those different durations but for the same given epoch of reionisation , @xmath103 , an observing redshift , @xmath104 , and in the case of the `` photon - counting limit '' ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the difference in the duration of reionisation induces both a minor and a major effects on the spectra .",
    "the minor effect is the observed shift of the peak position to higher @xmath21s with increasing durations . since a longer duration increases the contribution of the visibility function @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross - cl ] ) , which we plot in the right panel of fig .  [ fig : clre10 ] , the contributions from redshifts larger than @xmath96 accumulate in the calculation of the integration . however , spherical bessel functions have a steep cutoff after @xmath39 so that the contributions from epochs earlier than @xmath39 are negligible .",
    "therefore , additional effective contributions come from only the former epoch @xmath106 , and make the peak shift toward higher @xmath21 modes .    the major effect of @xmath92 exhibited in the plot ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clre10 ] ) is the damping at high @xmath21s with increasing durations of reionisation .",
    "this occurs again due to the increase of the amplitude of the visibility function at @xmath107 . at high @xmath21s ,",
    "the source term @xmath23 exhibits rapid oscillations .",
    "since the tail of the visibility function is larger , the range of the integral is larger , and it thus encompasses more oscillations . as a result , many more cancellations occur which damp the overall power .",
    "we note that the damping depends on the duration of the reionisation which is an advantage of observing the cross - correlation signal . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is difficult to see differences among cmb polarisation spectra for different durations , because the thomson optical depth is not strongly sensitive to this parameter .",
    "however the plots in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clre10 ] , clearly show that the damping of angular spectrum of the cross - correlation is sensitive to the duration of reionisation making it a potential tool for constraining this parameter of the reionisation history .",

    "we find that increasing @xmath91 shifts the position of the first peak to small scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : differentrecross ] ) .",
    "the reason is the same as the one invoked for the shifts observed in the left panel of fig .",

    "( [ eq : xh ] ) , the amplitude of the cross - correlation of the cmb doppler temperature anisotropies and the 21  cm line fluctuations reaches its maximum value at @xmath118 where the ionised fraction is about half .",
    "the same is true in the case of the cross - correlation of 21  cm line fluctuations and @xmath0-mode polarisation .",
    "the reason for this is that the cmb polarisation is produced in the ionised regions whereas 21  cm line fluctuations are associated with neutral regions .",
    "we note that the signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : peakzzre10 ] is smaller at lower redshifts than at higher redshifts .",
    "this is due to the fact that the 21  cm signal vanishes once reionisation is completed , i.e. at redshifts smaller than @xmath119 . for higher redshifts ( @xmath120 ) , the low scattered quadrupole component of the @xmath0-modes",
    "is suppressed like in the lower redshifts part , but the integration in the @xmath0-modes picks up contributions from the reionisation epoch and the @xmath0-modes are correlated with a larger contribution of the 21  cm signal . as a result ,",
    "the amplitude of the cross - correlation does not decline as steeply as for @xmath121 .",
    "the difference between the curves is easily interpreted . in the @xmath111 case",
    ", full reionisation takes longer to complete than in the @xmath102 case .",
    "therefore , neutral regions persist longer , broadening the skewed bell - shape of the curve centered on @xmath122 .",
    "the slight difference in the peak value is due to the cumulative effect of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross - cl ] ) .",
    "this is particularly well illustrated by the case of `` instantaneous reionisation '' ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that our assumption , @xmath123 , is formally not valid before the beginning of reionisation . in order to evaluate the cross - correlation signal correctly",
    ", we should rather take into account the full evolution of @xmath124 with redshift in the calculation of the 21  cm line fluctuations .",

    "this again is the same evolution that shows up in the power spectrum of the cross - correlation between the cmb temperature anisotropy and the 21  cm line fluctuations ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the evolution , with the observed redshift , of the shape and the amplitude of the first peak of cross - correlation between the 21  cm line fluctuations and @xmath0-mode fluctuations should allow us to constrain both the duration and redshift of reionisation .",

    "the location of the first peak in the ( @xmath96  @xmath142 ) plane is essentially independent of @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , tracking the evolution of the first peak amplitude by scanning the sky in @xmath96 bins would allow to determine @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , the width of the bell - shaped curve describing the evolution with @xmath96 of the @xmath94 first peak depends on @xmath143 .",
    "the duration of the reionisation is thus also accessible through this observable quantity .",
    "we also showed that , in addition to the amplitude and the position of the first peak , the duration of reionisation induces a significant damping of the oscillations on small scales .",
    "this strong dependence on the duration shows specifically in the cross - correlation power spectrum as it does not arise in the auto - correlations power spectra .",
    "these significant features , which are the oscillations and the maximum at the redshift when the ionised fraction are one half , is explained by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross - cl ] ) which is an exact analytic expression .",
    "they are robust and independent of the details of the model .",
    "assumptions are only introduced to relate the gravitational potential to the baryon density contrast and to the ionised fraction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross - cl ] ) . for the @xmath144 relation ,",
    "we assume linear perturbation theory which is valid on large scales ( @xmath145 ) and at high redshift ( @xmath146 ) . for the @xmath147-@xmath148 relation , we need to assume a reionisation model .",
    "we choose a simple model based on the halo model . in our redshift range when the reionised fraction is around one half , as shown in many numerical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the typical size of ionised bubbles is smaller than the instrumental resolution . in this case , we can assume that the ionised fraction can be set by the number of ionising sources ( for a detailed discussion see the appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations that provide detailed descriptions of the reionisation history can test those assumptions .    in the present study",
    ", we assumed the observation of the 21  cm line ideal . in practice",
    ", it amounts to consider that the frequency window function is the delta function @xmath149 , implying that observations are done at the specified frequency @xmath150 only . of course , for real observations , the finite instrumental frequency width has to be taken into account . for too broad window functions ,",
    "this is susceptible to induce an additional damping of the higher @xmath21 oscillations .",
    "we thus checked this effect in the case of the lofar interferometer that has a frequency width of 4 mhz . as a result",
    ", we did not obtain any additional significant damping of the oscillations for @xmath151 .",
    "both cmb and 21 cm signals suffer from the foreground contaminations .",
    "some of them will be correlated like the synchrotron emission from our galaxy .",
    "recent studies have shown that the cleaning of foreground were under control in both cmb and 21 cm observations @xcite .",
    "in addition , the multi frequency information on the cmb will allow the cross - correlation signal to be even less sensitive to the correlated foregrounds .    finally , due to the cosmic variance that limits cmb measurements on large scales , it may actually be difficult to pin - point the first peak with great accuracy .",
    "moreover , ground - based telescopes designed for observations of the 21  cm line background can not cover the whole sky .",
    "those two facts are not important limitations for our study , since the damping of oscillations in the cross - correlation power spectrum on intermediate scales ( @xmath152 ) , which are well enough sampled , depends strongly on the reionisation evolution . actually , even if the reionisation duration is so long that we can not detect the oscillations due to the strong damping , it is still possible to obtain a lower limit for the duration .",
    "we will study this in more detail with numerical simulations in the future .",
