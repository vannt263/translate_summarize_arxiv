    "relationship spanning four orders of magnitude in luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is interpreted as due to the presence of massive , young stars embedded in dust : a fraction of their uv radiation is absorbed by dust grains and reradiated in the infrared band , while supernova explosions may accelerate the electrons producing the observed synchrotron emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . since",
    "massive ( @xmath1 ) stars are short - lived , these luminosities are assumed to be indicators of the global star formation rate ( sfr ) in a galaxy .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the relation between sfr and radio / fir luminosities can be written as : @xmath2 with the fir flux defined after @xcite as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is in ergs@xmath5hz@xmath5 , @xmath6 in erg@xmath5 and infrared fluxes in jy .",
    "star forming galaxies are known to show luminous soft x - ray emission , originated in hot plasmas associated to star forming regions and galactic winds .",
    "a non linear ( @xmath7 ) and much scattered ( dispersion of about 2 dex ) relation was found between fir and soft ( 0.53.0 kev ) x - ray luminosities measured by the _ einstein _ satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "bepposax and asca observations of a sizable sample of star forming galaxies make possible to extend the study of these relations into the hard ( 210 kev ) x - ray band",

    "the atlas of optical nuclear spectra by @xcite ( hereafter hfs97 ) represents a complete spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the revised shapley - ames catalog of bright galaxies by @xcite ( rsa ) with declination @xmath8 and magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "optical spectra are classified in hfs97 on the basis of line intensity ratios according to @xcite ; galaxies with nuclear line ratios typical of star forming systems are labeled as `` hii nuclei '' .",
    "we cross - correlated the hfs97 sample with the iras faint source catalogue ( @xcite , fsc ; notice that the fsc only covers the sky with galactic latitude @xmath10 and is complete down to limiting fluxes of 0.2jy at @xmath11 and 1.0jy at @xmath12 ) obtaining a complete homogeneous sample of 193 nearby ( @xmath13 ) star forming galaxies ( hereafter the `` parent sample '' ) which was then cross - correlated with the bepposax and asca archives .",
    "eighteen galaxies were detected in the 210 kev band with the mecs or gis instruments .",
    "four additional objects in the field of view of asca observations were not detected .",
    "the 210 kev flux upper limits are too loose to add any significant information , and thus we did not include them in the sample .",

    "( 1990 , 1996 ) catalogues .",
    "most of the data have already been published ; in a few cases where published data were not available , we reduced the asca archival data .",
    "images and spectra were extracted from the pipeline - screened event files .",
    "the images were checked against optical ( digital sky survey ) and , where available , radio ( 20 cm ) images in order to look for possible source confusions .",
    "fluxes were calculated in the 0.52.0 and 210 kev bands from best - fit spectra and corrected for galactic absorption only .",
    "one object ( ) was not included in the sample since its broad - band ( 0.510 kev ) x - ray nuclear spectrum is dominated by a strong variable source ( ) identified as a black hole candidate ( @xcite ) .",
    "although m33 is identified by hfs97 as an hii nucleus , it has a very low sfr ( @xmath14 m@xmath15/yr ) so that the spectral signatures related to star formation can be easily hidden by a single powerful source .",

    "since the parent sample is complete within the statistical errors , these numbers represent an estimate of our sample completeness .",
    "all statistical tests presented here are performed on this sample unless otherwise stated .    in the figures we also plot data for 6 other well - known starburst galaxies which were not in the hfs97 survey because they are in the southern emisphere .",

    "these values can be compared with the mean @xmath28 for the 2809 galaxies in the iras 2jy sample by @xcite .",
    "although our sample shows a lower @xmath25 , this result may not be statistically significant .    as a further test we checked the soft x - ray / fir relation ( fig .",

    "[ pranalli - e3_tab : smpl ] ) in our analysis would lead to a slight flattening of the slope , i.e. @xmath34 ; likewise , if we use the @xmath11 luminosity instead of fir , we obtain @xmath35 with @xmath36",

    "least - squares fits yield : + @xmath39 + with mean @xmath30 s of 51% and 69% , respectively .",
    "the linearity and the dispersion are not significantly changed neither by the inclusion of the supplementary sample ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively ) , nor by the use of the @xmath11 luminosity ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that while the soft x - ray relations involve some further uncertainties related to the possible presence of intrinsic absorption , this is negligible in the 210 kev band for column densities usually found in normal galaxies .",
    "a high column density ( @xmath45 ) could partially obscure a possible agn contribution ; however this seems unlikely for our sample because of the selection of the objects by optical spectroscopy and of their moderate x - ray luminosity ( @xmath46 erg / s ) .",
    "the existence of a tight linear relation implies that the three considered bands all carry the same information .",
    "since the radio and far infrared luminosity are indicators of the sfr , the 210 kev luminosity should also be an indicator of sfr .    by repeating the best fit procedure under the assumption of strict linear relationships , consistent within @xmath47 with the result of eq .",

    "the 1  ms _ chandra _ ( @xcite ) and the radio 8.4 ghz ( @xcite ) catalogs of the hubble deep field north ( ) reach a limiting flux which is sufficiently deep to detect star - forming galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath51 , and can be used to check wether the radio / x - ray relation holds also for distant galaxies .",
    "radio and x - ray positions were matched with an encircling radius of @xmath52 .",
    "all objects classified by @xcite as agn , or with an elliptical or undefined morphology were excluded ; all other objects are accepted as `` candidate starbursts '' .",
    "fluxes at 1.4ghz were calculated making use of 8.4ghz data and spectral indexes measured for each object and reported in @xcite .",
    "redshifts were taken from @xcite .",
    "fluxes in the 210 kev were derived from a power - law fit to the observed 0.58 kev counts by @xcite .",
    "radio and x - ray k - corrections were calculated for a range of spectral indexes and redshifts ; we chose to use mean k - corrections since the induced error would not significantly affect the rest - frame fluxes .",
    "we find that radio and x - ray luminosities of candidate starburst galaxies at larger redshifts follow the same relation we observe in the very local universe ( fig .",
    "[ pranalli - e3_fig : fig3 ] ) , which now spans 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "we have analyzed a small but well defined sample of 17 star forming galaxies for which there is a homogeneous information on optical , fir , radio and x - ray bands ( local sample ) .",
    "the bepposax and asca x - ray data have been corrected for galactic absorpion only . in agreement with a previous work ( @xcite )",
    "we find that the logarithms of the soft ( 0.52 kev ) x - ray luminosities are linearly correlated with the logarithms of either radio ( 1.4 ghz ) and fir luminosities , and that within the statistical errors these relationships are consistent with linearity between the corresponding luminosities .",
    "we have extended our analysis to the harder x - ray band , essentially free from internal absorption which may affect the soft x - ray fluxes , and found that there is a tight linear correlation between the x - ray luminosities in the 210 kev interval with both the radio and the fir luminosities , normally assumed as the indicators of the star formation rate .",
    "we conclude that the origin of the hard x - ray emission must be closely related to star formation .    by selecting candidate starburst galaxies from the hdf north",
    ", whose redshift range extends up to @xmath53 , we find that their x - ray ( @xmath54 ) and radio ( @xmath55 ) luminosities closely follow the same linear relationship derived for the local sample .",
    "this linear correlation encompasses five orders of magnitude in luminosity , up to @xmath56 several @xmath57 erg  s@xmath5 and a corresponding star formation rate @xmath58 yr@xmath5 .",
    "we also notice that for the highest luminosity galaxies ( which have @xmath38 ) the observed 210 kev band corresponds to a rest - frame 4.522 kev , where the emission is likely to be non - thermal .",
    "a plasma hot enough to dominate the emission in this band would pose many problems in heating and bounding the gas .    the way to understand the physics involved in hard x - ray emission must go through a careful analysis of _ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ observation , which have the necessary spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity .",
    "moreover , since the radio / fir relation holds also locally in galaxies down to scales of about 100pc , it is worth remarking that the two star - bursting nuclei of closely follow the hard x - ray / radio relation , as suggested by our preliminary work on the _ chandra _ observation for this galaxy .",
    "the explanation of the radio / fir correlation is still a matter of discussion ; we hope that these results may help in clarifying this issue .",
    "we are currently analysing possibilities for a theoretical interpretation which , along with further constraints on this observational results , will be the subject of a forthcoming paper ."
