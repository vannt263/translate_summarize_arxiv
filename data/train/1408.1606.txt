    "however , the handful of snic - bl known are diverse and can vary considerably in these explosion properties @xcite .",
    "this diversity has been underscored by recent examples such as sn2007bg @xcite , sn 2007ru @xcite , sn2009nz @xcite , sn 2010ay @xcite , ptf10qts @xcite , sn2010ah @xcite , and ptf12gzk @xcite .",

    "sn2009bb was a snic - bl that exhibited radio properties consistent with a non - negligible portion of its ejecta moving at relativistic speeds as observed in grbs , yet was subenergetic by a factor of @xmath21 and did not have a grb detection @xcite .",
    "because the bulk explosion parameters of sn2009bb could not account for the copious energy coupled to relativistic ejecta , it was concluded that a central engine ( e.g. , black hole accretion or magnetar ) must have driven part of the explosion .",

    "sn2012ap was found to have relativistic outflow but without an observed grb @xcite .",

    "thus , it is of interest to compare and contrast the properties of sn2009bb and sn2012ap to those of other snibc and grb - sn .",
    "below we discuss some of the more interesting observational properties of these relativistic supernovae without a grb detection uncovered in our analysis , and discuss their relevance to potential progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms .",
    "our multi - epoch ` syn++ ` fits of the optical and near - infrared spectra of sn2012ap strongly favor the identification of helium in the ejecta .",
    "detection begins from the first observation on day @xmath68 and photospheric velocities of 20,000  are measured .",
    "in addition , hydrogen is likely to be present and detached above the photosphere traveling at @xmath89 .",
    "helium was also detected in pre - maximum light spectra of sn2009bb @xcite , though in that case it was not as conspicuous , and hydrogen was not reported .",
    "it is not unusual for helium to be detected in the spectra of snic and snic - bl .",
    "observations of sufficient quality and temporal coverage in combination with spectral modeling have shown that absorption features in a variety of snibc spectra can sometimes be best understood as arising from helium @xcite . in some of these instances ,",
    "hydrogen traveling at velocities above the photosphere has also been identified as a possible constituent of the ejecta .    however , the extent of h and he in snibc , and especially snic - bl , remains debated @xcite .",
    "it is particularly difficult to derive masses of he because of the high excitation potentials of he that exceed the energy of thermal photons and electrons , and require detailed non - lte spectral modeling .",
    "the presence or lack of lines in snibc may indicate a genuine helium deficiency , or , alternatively , the result of inadequate excitation @xcite .",
    "only a small amount of helium ( @xmath90 ) needs to be present to be observable @xcite , but asymmetric mixing or weak mixing may prevent sizable amounts of he from being excited by co @xcite . with time",
    ", sn expansion will thin the ejecta and should eventually expose any he - rich material to radioactive decay @xcite .    determining the amount of h and he in sn ejecta is an important constraint on the evolutionary state of the progenitor star at the time of explosion .",
    "there is ample reason to believe that sizable quantities of these elements should remain , as no completely hydrogen - free low - mass helium stars are known @xcite , and stellar models have difficulties explaining strong loss of he @xcite .",
    "recent stellar evolution calculations predict that the mass of he can reach upwards of @xmath91 in snibc progenitors .",
    "6300 , 6364 in sn2012ap betwen day 218 and 272 .",
    "emission redward of 6300   increases with time . ]",
    "conspicuous asymmetry in the [ ] 6300 , 6364 profile of sn2012ap is suggestive of two peaks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : latetimespecoi ] ) .",
    "examinations of late - time spectra of many snibc ( @xmath92 ) have demonstrated that double - peaked line profiles in [ ] emission seem to be a relatively common phenomenon occurring in 3040% of objects @xcite .",
    "such double - peaked emission - line profiles deviate from the single - peaked profile expected from a spherically symmetric source , and this has been interpreted as evidence for aspheric debris having a toroidal or disk - like geometry @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed a double - peaked [ ] profile in the snic - bl 2003jd and interpreted it as emission originating from a torus of o - rich debris perpendicular to a high - velocity jet in a grb model . in this framework",
    ", nondetections of grbs from snic - bl are the consequence of viewing jet - driven explosions along the equatorial expansion plane perpendicular to the jet axis .    the double - peaked [ ] profile observed in sn2012ap could be produced by a toroidal ejecta geometry similar to the mazzali et al.model .",
    "if so , the distribution of o - rich material in sn2012ap was not as aspheric as in sn2003jd because the peaks observed in sn2012ap are neither as pronounced nor as widely separated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : oicaiivelocity ] ) .",
    "notably , sn2009bb does not exhibit considerable asymmetry in its [ ] distribution , although @xcite report that the signature of aspheric explosion dynamics might have been seen in earlier nebular data .",
    "alternatively , the observed [ ] profile of sn2012ap could be the result of absorption in the sn interior .",
    "the evolution in the relative strength of the two peaks of [ ] emission is consistent with this notion .",
    "the two peaks are divided by a steep dropoff in emission near zero velocity , and the strength of emission redward of zero velocity increases over time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : latetimespecoi ] ) .",
    "the fact that [ ] is asymmetric and preferentially blueshifted with a distribution similar to that observed in [ ] is also consistent with a significant portion of interior ejecta being opaque ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oicaiivelocity ] ) .",
    "possible contributors to this opacity are high densities or dust in the ejecta .",
    "optically thick inner ejecta could prevent light from the rear side of the sn from penetrating , creating a flux deficit in the redshifted part of emission lines @xcite , as observed in the late - time emission profiles of sn2012ap ( figure [ fig : oicaiivelocity ] ) .",
    "internal absorption associated with high densities is generally not anticipated at these late epochs ( @xmath93 d ) because sn expansion should lead to low densities with associated low optical opacities @xcite .",
    "however , deviations from spherical symmetry and clumping make it possible for portions of the ejecta to remain optically thick @xcite .",
    "dust formation is not directly supported by our observations .",
    "there is no change in the blueshifted position of the peaks toward smaller wavelengths @xcite , and no late - time infrared observations are available to detect potential flux excess at wavelengths that would be associated with heated dust emission ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several properties of sn2012ap and sn2009bb distinguish them from most snic - bl and may have implications for the progenitor systems of relativistic sn lacking a grb detection .",
    "one such property is their host environment metallicities .",
    "the oxygen abundance of the explosion site of sn2012ap using the n2 scale of @xcite is @xmath94 ( m14 ) , which is slightly above solar ( z@xmath95 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the host metallicity of sn2009bb was estimated to be @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "these metallicities are at the high end of environments of the majority of snic - bl discovered by targeted surveys , and substantially higher than those of sn discovered in untargeted surveys where the mean metallicity is @xmath97 @xcite . sn2009bb and",
    "sn2012ap were both discovered by targeted surveys .",
    "it is worth noting that both sn were located in the outer regions of their host galaxies along the edges of spiral arms .",
    "this runs counter to recent studies that find that the majority of snic are much more likely to occur in the brightest regions of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "spiral galaxies typically show decreasing metallicity gradients with respect to radial distance from the core @xcite , but this trend is known to have important exceptions @xcite .",
    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars have long been a suspected progenitor system of snibc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , considerable evidence , including luminosity limits derived from nondetections of progenitor stars in high - resolution pre - explosion images @xcite , have ruled out a large population of wr stars , and it is unlikely that wr stars are the dominant progenitor channel . instead ,",
    "relatively low - mass helium stars in binary systems may represent a large fraction of snibc @xcite .    in the case of sn2012ap",
    ", there is circumstantial evidence in support of a wr star association .",
    "m14 report that the unusually strong dibs in the optical spectra that exhibit changes in ew over short ( @xmath98 days ) timescales do so in a manner consistent with the sn interacting with a nearby source of the dibs . the only other reported cases of time - varying dib features have been in families of wr and luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars @xcite .",
    "interestingly , sn2009bb was also found to be associated with strong dib absorptions in its moderately extinguished optical spectra , as was sn2008d , which exhibited broad - lined features similar to sn2012ap before maximum light but then evolved into a snib . although chance alignments between dib carrier - rich molecular clouds and these sn are possible , it may be that the sn progenitor systems are related to the sources of the dibs , and that the source could be related to mass loss from the progenitor star .",
    "lbv and wr stars exhibit varying degrees of asymmetric mass loss @xcite ; thus , an observer s line of sight with respect to a circumstellar disk could be an important factor in explaining why strong dib detections are rare .",
    "we have presented ultraviolet , optical , and near - infrared observations of the broad - lined type ic sn2012ap , which is the second known example of a sn from a stripped - envelope progenitor capable of accelerating a non - negligible portion of its ejecta to relativistic velocities ( @xmath99 ) but not associated with a grb detection .",
    "the only known counterpart is sn2009bb .",
    "notable properties of these two relativistic snic - bl may reflect key aspects of their progenitor systems and explosion dynamics .",
    "in particular , both sn2012ap and sn2009bb share the following characteristics :                @xcite propose that sn2009bb and sn2012ap represent the weakest of central - engine - driven explosions , and conclude that these events lack an associated grb detection because engine activity stops before the jet is able to pierce through the stellar envelope .",
    "though `` choked , '' the jet is still able to accelerate a small fraction of ejecta to relativistic velocities .",
    "engines of short durations or progenitors of large stellar envelopes may inhibit the jet from completely piercing the surface of the star .",
    "indeed , sn2009bb and sn2012ap may be among the weakest explosions for which we are able to detect the presence of jet activity .",
    "the continuum of explosions extending from grb - sn to more ordinary snibc suggests that a wider variety of jet activity may potentially be occurring at energies that are observationally `` hidden .",
    "'' detection at weaker scales is challenging since such explosions do not produce electromagnetic signatures as easily recognizable as grbs .",
    "sn of this variety can be dynamically indistinguishable from ordinary core - collapse sn @xcite , and/or their high - energy emissions may be below the threshold of the current generation of gamma - ray instruments @xcite .",
    "some hints in support of jets at smaller energy scales come from supernova remnants .",
    "cassiopeia a , known to be the result of an asymmetric type iib explosion @xcite , exhibits exceptionally high velocity si- and s - rich material in a jet / counter - jet arrangement @xcite .",
    "the known extent of this jet region contains fragmented knots of debris traveling @xmath104@xmath10115,000 , which is three times the velocity of the bulk of the o- and s - rich main shell . though the large opening half - angle of this high - velocity ejecta is inconsistent with a highly collimated flow @xcite , some jet - like mechanism carved a path allowing interior material from the si - s - ar - ca region near the core out past the mantle and h- and he - rich photosphere .",
    "this process , potentially related to a protoneutron star wind that follows the supernova outburst @xcite , would be observationally indistinguishable from non - jet explosion models at extragalactic distances .",
    "rotation is believed to be a key variable driving the outcome of these explosions .",
    "if the jet is associated with the protoneutron star or magnetar wind that follows the sn , rapid rotation will naturally amplify magnetic fields and make magnetohydrodynamic power influential @xcite .",
    "grbs may only come from the most rapidly rotating and most massive stars @xcite .",
    "progenitor composition and structure is another important consideration in sn explosions @xcite .",
    "he and/or h layers that can vary in thickness along different viewing angles @xcite , have the potential to quench relativistic jets ( e.g. , sn2008d ; @xcite ) , and can lead to expansion asymmetries that can be potentially detected by spectropolarimetry @xcite .",
    "the inferred presence of helium in the optical spectra of sn2012ap and sn2009bb is consistent with the quenched jet scenario .    with only two events identified so far ,",
    "it is possible that the exceptional properties of sn2012ap and 2009bb discussed here are biased by transient surveys targeting metal - rich systems .",
    "additional examples of relativistic snic - bl are needed to test whether the properties maintain and to further understand these events in the entire context of snibc . given their complex origins  e.g. , line - of - sight influences of potentially asymmetric explosions inside progenitors of varying structure and compositions , varying core - rotation speeds , and asymmetric circumburst mediums of differing metallicities  real progress requires an in - depth and multi - wavelength ( radio through gamma - rays ) approach studying a large sample ( @xmath105 ) of local snic - bl .",
