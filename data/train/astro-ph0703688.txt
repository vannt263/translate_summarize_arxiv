    "one of the first steps toward understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies is a determination of the radial distribution of mass within a representative sample of systems .",
    "the rotational balance of stars and gas in the plane of a disk galaxy offers a powerful probe of its mass distribution , and has been widely exploited @xcite .    when the motions of these tracers are consistent with small departures from circular orbits , the determination of the rotation curve ( more precisely , the circular orbital speed profile ) is straightforward .",
    "however , it has long been known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that large non - circular motions driven by bar - like or oval distortions , warps , or lopsidedness are common features in galaxy velocity maps , which complicate the determination of the radial mass profile .",
    "yet the observed flow pattern contains a great deal of information about the mass distribution , which we wish to extract from the data .    since galaxies with closely flat , nearly axisymmetric disks are the exception , it is desirable to be able to estimate a mass profile in the more general cases . a number of techniques , which we review in  [ theory ] , already exist for this purpose .",
    "a procedure for dealing with a warped disk has been successfully developed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the first simple tilted ring analyses ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and is now widely used .",
    "non - axisymmetric distortions to the planar flow can always be described by an harmonic analysis .",
    "but the approach pioneered by @xcite for interpreting the resulting coefficients embodies epicycle theory , which is valid only for small departures from circular orbits and may give misleading results if the observed non - circular motions are not small compared with the circular orbital speed .",
    "a number of authors ( see  [ theory ] for references ) appear to find significant radial flows with speeds that rival the inferred mean orbital motion .",
    "such flows violate the assumption of small departures from circular motion , are physically not well motivated , and the results are hard to interpret .",
    "we therefore propose here a new technique for fitting a general non - axisymmetric model to the velocity field of a galaxy that allows for large non - circular motions .",
    "we develop and apply the method specifically for the case of bar - like or oval distortions , but the procedure is readily generalized for potentials having other azimuthal periodicities .",
    "our simple kinematic model , which we describe in  [ technique ] , yields both the mean orbital speed and the amplitudes of the non - circular streaming velocities .",
    "it is successful because ( 1 ) we invoke a straight bar - like distortion to the potential , ( 2 ) we do not need to assume small departures from circular motion , and ( 3 ) we fit to the entire velocity field at once .",
    "we apply our method (  [ n2976 ] ) to the high - quality velocity maps of ngc  2976  that were previously presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sblb ) , and find that it suggests a significantly different radial mass profile from that deduced by those authors .",
    "we show (  [ discuss ] ) the reason for this difference , and argue that a bisymmetric distortion is both a more reasonable physical model , and that it is supported by independent evidence of a bar in this galaxy .",
    "the velocity of a star or an element of gas in the plane of the disk of a galaxy generally has two components at each point : tangential , @xmath1 , and radial , @xmath2 , relative to any arbitrary center , most conveniently the kinematic center . without approximation , each component can be expressed as a fourier series around a circle of radius @xmath3 in the disk plane : @xmath4\\ ] ] and @xmath5,\\ ] ] where the coefficients , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and phases relative to some convenient axis , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are all functions of @xmath3 . the quantity @xmath10 is the mean streaming speed of the stars or gas about the center ; throughout , we refer to this quantity as the mean orbital speed .",
    "the axisymmetric term of the radial motion , @xmath11 , represents a mean inflow or outflow in the disk plane , which gives rise to a `` continuity problem '' if it is large @xcite .",
    "galaxies are observed in projection , with inclination @xmath12 , about a major axis , which we choose to define as @xmath13 in the above expansions .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity is the sum of the projected azimuthal and radial velocities : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the systemic velocity of the galaxy . in terms of our fourier series , @xmath16 \\right . \\\\ &   & \\left . + \\ ; { \\ensuremath{\\bar v_r}}\\sin\\theta + \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty v_{m , r}\\sin\\theta \\cos\\left [ m\\theta + \\theta_{m , r } \\right ] \\right\\}. \\label{defvobs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using standard trigonometric relations , this expression can be rewritten as @xmath17 \\right . \\\\",

    "* ) , projection therefore causes velocity distortions with intrinsic sectoral harmonic @xmath18 to give rise to azimuthal variations of orders @xmath19 in the corresponding line - of - sight velocities .",
    "thus intrinsic distortions at two different sectoral harmonics give rise to projected velocity features of the same angular periodicity in the data , complicating the determination of all coefficients in the expansion .",
    "the principal scientific objective of most spectroscopic observations of disk galaxies is to extract the function @xmath10 , which should be a good approximation to the circular orbital speed if all other coefficients on the right - hand side of eq .  [ defvobs ] are small . with a single slit spectrum along the major axis of the galaxy",
    ", one generally sets @xmath20 , implicitly assuming all other terms to be negligible . in this case",
    ", the inclination must be determined from other data ( e.g.  photometry ) .",
    "differences larger than measurement errors between the approaching and receding sides flag the existence of non - circular motions , but measurements along a single axis do not yield enough information to determine any other coefficient .",
    "this and other uncertainties inherent in such deductions are well - rehearsed @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional velocity map , on the other hand , provides much more information .",
    "software packages , such as _ rotcur _",
    "@xcite , allow one to fit the velocity field with a single velocity function @xmath10 in a set of annuli whose centers , position angles ( pas ) and inclinations are allowed , if desired , to vary with radius .",
    "this package is ideal for the purpose for which it was designed : to determine the mean orbital speed even when the plane of the disk may be warped .",
    "it works well when non - circular motions are small , but yields spurious variations of the parameters when the underlying flow contains non - axisymmetric , especially bisymmetric , distortions .",
    "@xcite adopted a different approach .",
    "they assumed the plane of the disk to be flat , and determined the rotation center , inclination , and pa by fitting a non - parametric circular flow pattern to the entire velocity map .",
    "their method averages over velocity distortions caused by spiral arms , for example , but again may yield spurious projection angles and mean orbital speeds if there is a bar - like or oval distortion to the velocity field over a wide radial range .",
    "the _ rotcurshape _ program , recently added to the nemo @xcite package , suffers from the same drawback because it also assumes a flat , axisymmetric disk .",
    "furthermore , it fits multiple parametric components to a velocity field and thus has less flexibility than the @xcite technique .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pioneered efforts to measure and interpret the non - axisymmetric coefficients that describe an observed velocity field , and expansions up to order @xmath21 are now routinely carried out ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their approach assumes departures from circular motion to be small so that the radial and tangential perturbations for any sectoral harmonic can be related through epicycle theory .",
    "the technique is therefore appropriate only when all fitted coefficients are small and the mean orbital speed is close to the circular orbital speed that balances the azimuthally averaged central attraction .",
    "@xcite present an extensive discussion of this technique and conclude that it is difficult to work backwards from the derived fourier coefficients to distinguish between different physical models .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite report velocity fields for nearby galaxies that show non - circular motions whose amplitude rivals the mean orbital speed at small @xmath3",
    ". swaters et al .",
    "( 2003b ) note that their @xmath22  model fails to reproduce the inner disk kinematics of their target .",
    "they correct @xmath22  for an isotropic velocity dispersion of 8 km / s , but do not attempt to model the isovelocity twists in their h@xmath0 velocity field .",
    "fit the simplest acceptable model to their data : an axisymmetric flow with just two non - zero coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "they favor this model over a bar - like distortion partly because the galaxy is not obviously barred , and partly because they find that the @xmath23 components are scarcely larger than the noise ( see also  [ n2976 ] ) .",
    "the addition of the radial velocity term @xmath24  allows a more complicated flow pattern to be fitted with an axisymmetric model , which significantly improves the fit to their data .",
    "@xcite do detect a radial @xmath25 component in addition to a strong radial @xmath26 term in the kinematics that they report , which they conclude `` are consistent with an inner bar of several hundreds of pc and accretion of material in the outer regions '' . despite finding large non - circular motions",
    ", the authors of all three studies nonetheless adopted their derived mean orbital speed as the `` rotation curve '' of the galaxy , which they assume results from centrifugal balance with the azimuthally averaged mass distribution .",
    "these deductions are suspect , however . as we show below (  [ discuss].1 ) , a bisymmetric distortion to the flow pattern may not give rise to a large @xmath23 term in the velocity field , and the smallness of these terms does not establish the absence of a strong bisymmetric distortion .",
    "further , associating the @xmath27 term with the rotation curve is valid only if all departures from circular motion are small , yet they had found non - circular velocity components almost as large as the mean orbital speed over a significant radial range",
    ".    early work on modeling gas flows in barred galaxies is reviewed in sellwood & wilkinson ( 1993 ; see their section 6.7 ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite attempt to build a self - consistent fluid - dynamical model of the non - axisymmetric flow pattern .",
    "they estimate the non - axisymmetric part of the mass distribution from photometry and try to match the observed flow to hydrodynamic simulations to determine the amplitude of the non - axisymmetric components of the potential .",
    "the objective of this , altogether more ambitious , approach is to determine the separate contributions of the luminous and dark matter to the potential . here ,",
    "our objective is more modest : to estimate the mean orbital speed from a velocity map that may possibly be strongly non - axisymmetric .",
    "thus their attempt to separate the baryonic from dark matter contributions seems needlessly laborious for our more limited purpose .",
    "our objective is to model non - circular motions in a 2-d velocity map .",
    "since we do not wish to assume that non - circular motions are small , we refrain from adopting the epicycle approximation .",
    "however , we do make the following assumptions :    * the non - circular motions in the flow stem from a bar - like or oval distortion to an axisymmetric potential .",
    "we suppose these motions to be caused by either a non - axially symmetric halo in the dark matter or by a bar in the mass distribution of the baryons .",
    "* a strong bisymmetric distortion to the potential , even one that is exactly described by a @xmath28 angular dependence , can give rise to more complicated motions of the stars and gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the flow may contain higher even harmonics .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath29 terms will always be the largest , and we therefore begin by neglecting higher harmonics .",
    "* we assume the bar - like distortion drives non - circular motions about a fixed axis in the disk plane . in a steady bar - like flow",
    ", the perturbed parts of the azimuthal and radial velocities must be exactly out of phase with each other .",
    "that is , the azimuthal streaming speed is smallest on the bar major axis and greatest on its minor axis , while radial motions are zero in these directions and peak , with alternating signs , at intermediate angles @xcite .",
    "* we must assume the disk to be flat , because we require the predicted @xmath30 from eq .",

    "the mean orbital speed , @xmath22 , in the radial  model can balance the central attraction of the system only if either the non - circular motions are small , or @xmath99  actually implies a real radial flow that somehow does not affect orbital balance .",
    "the first possibility is not true , as we have confirmed ( figs .",
    "[ rcs ] and [ comps ] ) the large non - circular motions found for @xmath172pc in ngc  2976  by .",
    "if @xmath99  is attributed to radial flows that do not affect orbital balance , then all of the detected gas in this quiescent system would be displaced on kpc scales in @xmath173gyr ; we agree with @xcite that this explanation is not viable .",
    "we thus conclude that although the optimal radial  model is a reasonable statistical fit to the data and provides strong evidence for non - circular motions , the fitted @xmath22  can not be used to determine the mass distribution within ngc  2976 .",
    "if the non - circular motions in ngc  2976  are dominated by an @xmath29 perturbation to its potential , then the velocity profiles of the optimal bisymmetric  model should better reflect the galaxy s structure than those of the radial  model . while the fitted @xmath22  rises more steeply in the bisymmetric  model , it is merely the average azimuthal speed around a circle , not a precise indicator of circular orbital balance .",
    "it should be stressed that circles in the disk plane approximate streamlines only when non - circular motions are small . in a bar - like potential",
    ", the gas on the bar major axis will be moving more slowly than average , since it is about to plunge in towards the center , whereas gas at the same galactocentric radius on the bar minor axis will be moving faster than average , since it has arrived there from a larger radius .",
    "under these circumstances , it is not possible to assert that the azimuthal average , @xmath106 , is exactly equal to the circular orbit speed in an equivalent azimuthally averaged mass distribution . the only reliable way to extract the azimuthally averaged central attraction in this case is to find the non - axisymmetric model that yields a fluid dynamical flow pattern to match that observed , and to average afterwards .    despite these cautionary statements",
    ", we suspect that the @xmath106  curve from the bisymmetric  model provides a better estimate , than does that from the radial  model , of the azimuthally averaged central attraction in ngc  2976 .      as discussed in ",
    " [ intro ] & [ technique ] , the elliptical streams of fixed direction and phase in the bisymmetric  model could be driven by either a triaxial halo or by a bar in the mass distribution . in either case ,",
    "the distortion is significant only at @xmath174 ( @xmath175kpc ; fig .",
    "[ rcs]_b _ ) in ngc  2976 , beyond which the flow appears to be near circular .",
    "the aspherical halo interpretation therefore requires the halo that hosts ngc  2976  to have an asphericity that increases for decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "such an idea was proposed by @xcite , although other work @xcite has indicated a tendency for disk assembly to circularize the potential .",

    "their fits to this photometry reveal a radial variation in ellipticity of amplitude @xmath178 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their visual inspection of the images reveals a  candidate \" bar with @xmath179 and semi - major axis @xmath180 ( see their table  2 ) .",
    "their estimated @xmath181 is fully consistent with our kinematic estimate @xmath47  ( table  [ fits ] ) , and @xmath182 compares well with the range of @xmath3 where @xmath49  and @xmath50  are non - zero ( fig .",
    "[ rcs]_b _ ) . furthermore , @xmath181 and @xmath47  are roughly coincident with the apparent major axis of the co distribution in ngc  2976  ( see fig .  4 of ) , which suggests that the molecular gas density is larger along this pa than elsewhere in the disk .",
    "thus the 2mass photometry and co morphology provide strong supporting evidence that ngc  2976  contains a bar with the properties implied by our bisymmetric  model .",
    "our fits have revealed strong non - circular motions in ngc  2976  that appear to result from forcing by a bar . while @xmath22  in the bisymmetric  model better reflects the azimuthally averaged mass distribution than its counterpart in the radial  model , precise statements about the mass budget in ngc  2976  are hampered by our lack of a reliable estimate of the circular orbital speed curve ( see  [ balance ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the non - circular motions in ngc  2976  implies a relatively large bar mass , which in turn suggests that the disk itself contributes significantly to the central attaction .",
    "it is therefore likely that the baryons in ngc  2976  dominate its kinematics well beyond the @xmath183pc suggested by the fits of .",
    "indeed , the steeper rise of @xmath22  in the bisymmetric  model relative to that deduced by would allow a larger disk mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath184 ) to be tolerated by the kinematics .",
    "this conclusion eases the tension between their dynamical upper bound on the stellar @xmath184 and that expected from stellar population synthesis for the observed broadband colors .",
    "we defer the detailed mass modeling of ngc  2976  required for quantitative estimates of its mass budget to a future paper .",
    "such a study would be assisted by additional kinematic data from extant  aperture synthesis observations , as well as by decompositions of publicly available infrared photometry from the _ spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey _ @xcite .",
    "we suggest that our approach could be useful for characterizing the non - circular motions detected in other galaxies , particularly in low - mass systems where the reported non - circular motions are large @xcite .",
    "it is more direct than interpretations of velocity field fourier coefficients in the weak perturbation limit , yields physically meaningful kinematic components for systems with bar - like or oval distortions to the potential , and its application is much simpler than that of a full fluid - dynamical model .",
    "we have shown that the velocity field of ngc  2976 , when fitted by our bisymmetric model , reveals a steeper inner rise in @xmath22  than in previous analyses by other methods .",
    "similar findings have been reported by hayashi & navarro ( 2006 ) and valenzuela et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for other systems . in ngc  2976",
    ", the reason for this difference ( fig .  [ comps ] ) is that the @xmath35  terms happen to partly cancel the @xmath106  terms , because they have opposite signs on the projected major axis when the bar is oriented close to this direction .",
    "it should be clear , however , that the @xmath35  terms will have the opposite effect if the bar is more nearly aligned with the projected minor axis .",
    "thus even if the non - circular motions detected in other systems result from bars in the potential , it is unlikely that our bisymmetric  model will always cause @xmath22  to rise more steeply than found previously . in any event , it should be clear that when large non - circular flows are present , the mean orbital speed derived from models that use epicycle theory can yield a very misleading estimate of the interior mass needed for centrifugal balance .",
    "we have presented a new method for fitting 2-d velocity maps of spiral galaxies that are characterized by non - circular motions .",
    "we suppose the potential to contain a bar - like or oval distortion that drives the gas in the disk plane on an elliptical flow pattern of fixed orientation , such as could arise from a triaxial halo or a bar in the mass distribution of the baryons .",
    "our model has important advantages over previous approaches since it is not restricted to small non - circular motions , as is required when epicycle theory is employed , and we do note invoke large radial flows that have no clear physical origin or interpretation .",
    "our bisymmetric  flow model can be fitted to data by a generalization of the technique developed by @xcite .",
    "the fit extracts multiple non - parametric velocity profiles from an observed velocity field , and we employ a bootstrap method to estimate uncertainties .    as an example , we have applied our technique to the h@xmath0  and co kinematics of ngc  2976  presented by .",
    "we show that the bisymmetric  model fits the data at least as well as the _ ringfit _ procedure implemented by these authors that invokes large radial velocities , which we are also able to reproduce by our methods .",
    "both the bisymmetric  and radial  models reveal large non - circular motions in ngc  2976 , but the derived mean orbital speed profiles @xmath22  differ markedly between the two cases .",
    "we explain the reason for this large difference in  [ discuss ] .    when disks are observed in projection , kinematic distortions with intrinsic sectoral harmonic @xmath18 cause azimuthal variations of orders @xmath185 in line - of - sight velocity maps .",
    "our analysis of ngc  2976  clearly demonstrates that @xmath26 distortions to its velocity field can be fitted by a bisymmetric distortion to the potential , which we regard as more physically reasonable than radial flows .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ comps ] that @xmath25 distortions should be small in the bisymmetric  model ; this is because the @xmath25 variations in the radial and tangential components project out of phase .",
    "they will cancel exactly only when of equal amplitude , which should be approximately true in the rising part of @xmath22 .",
    "we suggest that ngc  2976  hosts a strong bar oriented at @xmath186 to the projected major axis .",
    "our interpretation is supported by its co morphology and more strongly by the results of @xcite , who analyzed the 2mass photometry of ngc  2976  and found a bar whose size and orientation are similar to those required by our bisymmetric  model .",
    "we find that the mean orbital speed in ngc  2976  rises more steeply than indicated by previous studies (;",
    "while @xmath22  in our bisymmetric  model is not an exact measure of the circular orbital speed in the equivalent axially symmetrized galaxy , we regard it as a better approximation to this quantity .",
    "since the strongly non - circular flow pattern implies a massive bar , which in turn suggests a massive disk , we expect a larger baryonic mass than was estimated by .",
    "it is likely , therefore , that most of the increased central attraction required by our more steeply rising @xmath22  will not reflect a corresponding increase in the density of the inner dark matter halo , but will rather ease the tension between maximum disk fits to its kinematics and @xmath184 predictions from broadband photometry . indeed , since non - circular motions are detected throughout the region @xmath187 ( @xmath175kpc ) , it seems likely that the luminous matter in ngc  2976  is an important contributor to the central attraction at least as far out as this radius .",
    "detailed mass models of this system are forthcoming .",
    "application of our method to other galaxies will not always result in a steeper inner rise in the mean orbital speed .",
    "we find this behavior in ngc  2976  only because the bar is oriented near to the projected major axis .",
    "neglect of non - cirular motions , or application of a radial flow model , when the bar is oriented close to the projected minor axis will lead to an erroneously steep rise in the apparent inferred mean orbital speed , which will rise less steeply when our model is applied .",
