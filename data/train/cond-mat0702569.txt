    "this will lead to the universal thermodynamics of the bethe - peierls contact interaction fermions system with a zero - range , infinite scattering length interaction . to solve the universal resonant superfluidity thermodynamic problem , at least in principle ,",

    "it is presently accepted to be in the region @xmath9 . compared with the old values ,",
    "the updating experiments converge more towards @xmath10 .    the ultra - cold fermion atoms gas physics offers a plausible perspective in looking for the general nonperturbative statistical field theory methods . in the strongly interacting regime @xmath11 ,",
    "especially right at the unitary limit point @xmath12 , the infrared singular nature of the two - body scattering amplitude @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 being the relative wave - vector magnitude of the colliding particles ) rules out any conventional perturbative expansion techniques .",
    "it is generally believed that there is not a simple analytical method to compute the universal coefficient @xmath4 , although this topic stimulates many growing arduous theoretical efforts . by noting that an exact many - body theory concerns the behavior at unitarity is presently not available",
    ", it is not surprising that the existed analytical results about the universal coefficient @xmath4 differ from each other considerably(@xmath15 ) .",

    "it is well known that any effective medium dependent interaction with brueckner - bethe - goldstone(bbg ) techniques can easily violate this relation . the standard many - body technique to remove this tortuous difficulty is considering the quantum rearrangement effects of the single particle energy spectrum on the physical chemical potential and pressure .",
    "the role of the single particle energy spectrum shift will be explored in the strongly interacting unitary limit .    to elucidate the physical chemical potential and pressure(equation of state ) at both finite temperature and density transparently with a more concise non - relativistic recipe for the ultra - cold atomic physics is the present main motivation .",
