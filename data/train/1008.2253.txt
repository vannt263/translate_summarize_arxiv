    "while other methods to estimate or limit @xmath1 depend on various assumptions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the compactness limit seems to be independent of any model assumptions and hence it is considered to be the most robust one .",
    "however , recent fermi observations have also shown that the onset of higher energy ( @xmath3 mev to a few gev - denoted hereafter gev ) emission lags after the onset of the lower energy ( @xmath3 kev to a few mev - denoted hereafter mev ) prompt emission @xcite .",
    "fermi confirmed earlier egret results that the gev emission also lasts longer than the mev emission @xcite .",
    "these two facts suggest the possibility of a different origin for the mev and the gev emission",

    "2010 ; piran & nakar 2010 ; gao et al . 2009 ) , from multi - zone internal shocks @xcite or if the mev emission is the quasi - thermal radiation of the baryonic outflow while the gev emission is mainly from the subsequent internal shocks .",
    "the compactness limits on the lorentz factor are based , however , on an implicit assumption that the mev and the gev photon arise from the same region .",

    "consequently , the optical depth is smaller compared to the one - zone case and the compactness constraint on the lorentz factor becomes weaker .",

    "the constraint on the lorentz factor of the mev emitting region , arising from the optical depth of the gev photon , is rather weak .",
    "the weak limit does not contradict to the neutrino driven jets@xcite nor to the magnetic driven jets@xcite .",
    "for a canonical set of parameters , like @xmath97 , @xmath110s , @xmath112gev , @xmath99mev , @xmath160erg , and @xmath113s , the constraint on the gev region is @xmath161 .",
