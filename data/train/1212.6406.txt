    "from a microscopic point of view , damage behavior originates from breaking atomic links in the material whereas a macroscopic theory may specify the damage by a scalar variable related to the quantity of damage . according to the latter perspective ,",
    "phase - field models are quite common to model smooth transitions between damaged and undamaged material states .",
    "such phase - field models have been mainly investigated for incomplete damage . however , for a realistic modeling of damage processes in elastic materials , complete damage theories have to be considered , where the material can completely disintegrate .",
    "mathematical works of complete models covering global - in - time existence are rare and are mainly focused on purely _ rate - independent systems _ @xcite by using @xmath1-convergence techniques to recover energetic properties in the limit .",
    "existence results for _ rate - dependent _ complete damage systems in thermoviscoelastic materials are recently published in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , much mathematical efforts have been made in understanding incomplete damage processes .",
    "existence and uniqueness results for damage models of viscoelastic materials are proven in @xcite in the one dimensional case .",
    "higher dimensional damage models are analytically investigated in @xcite and , there , existence , uniqueness and regularity properties are shown . a coupled system describing incomplete damage , linear elasticity and phase separation appeared in @xcite .",
    "all these works are based on the gradient - of - damage model proposed by frmond and nedjar @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which describes damage as a result from microscopic movements in the solid .",
    "the distinction between a balance law for the microscopic forces and constitutive relations of the material yield a satisfactory derivation of an evolution law for the damage propagation from the physical point of view .",
    "in particular , the gradient of the damage variable enters the resulting equations and serves as a regularization term for the mathematical analysis .",
    "when the evolution of the damage is assumed to be uni - directional , i.e. the damage is irreversible , the microforce balance law becomes a differential inclusion .    for a non - gradient approach of damage models for brittle materials we refer to @xcite .",
    "there , the damage variable @xmath3 takes on two distinct values , i.e. @xmath4 , in contrast to our work , where @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "in addition , the mechanical properties are described in @xcite differently .",
    "they choose a @xmath3-mixture of a linearly elastic strong and weak material with two different elasticity tensors .",
    "damage modeling is an active field in the engineering community since the 1970s .",
    "for some recent works we refer to @xcite .",
    "a variational approach to fracture and crack propagation models can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "the reason why incomplete damage models are more feasible for mathematical investigations is that a coercivity assumption on the free energy prevents the material from a complete degeneration and dropping this assumption may lead to serious troubles .",
    "however , in the case of viscoelastic materials , the inertia terms circumvent this kind of problem in the sense that the deformation field still exists on the whole domain accompanied with a loss of spatial regularity ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . unfortunately",
    ", this result can not be expected in the case of quasi - static mechanical equilibrium ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the main aim of this work is to introduce and analyze a complete damage model for linear elastic materials which are assumed to be in quasi - static equilibrium . for the analytical discussion",
    ", we start with an incomplete damage model which is regularized in the equation of balance of forces as in @xcite such that already known existence results from the incomplete damage regime can be applied .",
    "the basis for a weak formulation of the regularized system is a notion introduced in @xcite .",
    "this notion seems well adapted for the transition to complete damage ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage is that we can deal with low regularity solutions and we are able to use weakly semi - continuity arguments for the passage to the limit . in our weak formulation ,",
    "the evolution law for the damage variable which is classically described by a differential inclusion becomes some kind of variational inequality combined with a total energy inequality .",
    "nevertheless , we are faced with several mathematical challenges since the system highly degenerates during the passage .",
    "the major challenge is to establish a meaningful deformation field on regions where the damage is _ not _ complete in the limit system .",
    "for instance , it might happen that in the limit path - connected components of the not completely damaged material are isolated from the dirichlet boundary . in this case",
    ", the deformation variable can not be controlled in the transition to complete damage with korn s inequality .",
    "we will overcome this particular issue by formulating the problem in terms of a _ time - depending domain_. the domain contains all the not completely damaged path - connected components of the material which still possess a part of the dirichlet boundary . inside the domain ,",
    "the damage evolution is still driven by a differential inclusion .",
    "the remaining area of the original domain consists of completely damaged material and of material parts which are not completely damaged and isolated from the dirichlet boundary .",
    "two further complicacies arise in this connection .",
    "the first issue concerns the energy inequality . the time - depending domain approach leads to jumps in the energy which must be accounted for in the energy inequality of the notion of weak solutions as well .",
    "this issue is tackled with @xmath1-convergence techniques in order to keep track of the energy at jump points .",
    "secondly , the time - depending domain might have very bad smoothness properties which again might lead to a failure of korn s inequality .",
    "this problem is approached by proving some covering results for these sets with smooth domains where korn s inequality can be applied . in this context , we introduce some special kind of local sobolev spaces where we look for solutions in the limit system .",
    "this paper is structurized as follows .",
    "the next section provides an overview of the notation we are going to use while section [ section : modeling ] developes our model first in a classical setting with enough smoothness properties and then in a rigorous mathematical setting by presenting a weak formulation with @xmath0-functions for the damage and local sobolev functions for the deformation .",
    "it is shown in theorem [ theorem : weakimpliesclassical ] that the weak notion reduces to the classical formulation when enough regularity is assumed .",
    "the main results , i.e. theorem [ theorem : mainexistenceresult ] and theorem [ theorem : localexistence ] , are stated in section [ section : mainresult ] while the proofs are carried out in the subsequent section [ section : proof ] .",
    "we first solve a simplified problem in section [ section : simplproblem ] . by zorn s lemma ,",
    "existence of solutions to the main problems will be proven in section [ section : mainprob ] .",
    "complete damage models are required for a realistic description of the whole damage process . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there are no global - in - time existence results of complete damage models of such degeneracy in the mathematical literature where the classical differential inclusion can be regained under some additional regularity assumptions .",
