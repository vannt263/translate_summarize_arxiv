    "the problem of resilience of networks to either random or targeted attack is crucial to many instances of real world networks , ranging from social networks ( like collaboration networks ) via technological networks ( like electrical power grids ) to communication networks ( like the world - wide web ) . of particular importance is whether the connectivity of a network relies on a small number of hubs and whether their loss will cause a large - scale breakdown .",
    "albert , albert and nakarado  @xcite argue that `` the power grid is robust to most perturbations , yet disturbances affecting key transmission substations greatly reduce its ability to function '' .",
    "experiments of albert , jeong , and barabsi  @xcite , holme , kim , yoon and han  @xcite and more recently of mishkovski , biey and kocarev  @xcite find robustness under random attack but vulnerability to the removal of a small number of key nodes in several other networks .",
    "the latter paper includes a study of data related to the human brain , as well as street , collaboration and power grid networks .",
    "one should expect this qualitative behaviour across the range of real world networks and it should therefore also be present in the key mathematical models of large complex networks .",
    "a well established feature of many real world networks is that in a suitable range of values  @xmath5 the proportion of nodes with degree  @xmath5 has a decay of order @xmath6 for a power law exponent  @xmath7 .",
    "the robustness of networks with small power law exponent under random attack has been observed heuristically by callaway et al .",
    "@xcite and cohen et al .",
    "@xcite , but there seems to be controversy in these early papers about the extent of the vulnerability in the case of targeted attack , see the discussion in @xcite and @xcite . as bollobs and riordan  (",
    "* section  10 ) point out , such heuristics , informative as they may be , are often quite far away from a mathematical proof that applies to a given model . in their seminal paper",
    "@xcite they provide the first rigorous proof of robustness in the case of a specific preferential attachment model with power law exponent  @xmath8 , and later dereich and mrters  @xcite proved for a class of preferential attachment models with tunable power law exponent that networks are robust under random attack if the power law exponent satisfies @xmath9 , but not when @xmath10 , thus revealing the precise location of the phase transition in the behaviour of preferential attachment networks .",
    "however , the question of vulnerability of robust networks when a small number of privileged nodes is removed has not been studied systematically in the mathematical literature so far .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to give evidence for the vulnerability of robust networks by providing rigorous proof that preferential attachment networks in the robust regime @xmath9 undergo a radical change under a targeted attack , i.e.  when an arbitrarily small proportion @xmath0 of the most influential nodes in the network is removed .",
    "our main results , presented in section  [ ss-13 ] , show how precisely this change affects the degree structure , the length of shortest paths and the connectivity in the network .",
    "the results take the form of limit theorems revealing explicitly the dependence of the relevant parameters on @xmath4 .",
    "not only does this provide further insight into the topology of the network and the behaviour as @xmath4 tends to zero , it also allows a comparison to other network models , and thus exposes two classes of robust networks with rather different behaviour , see section  [ ss-15 ] .",
    "our mathematical analysis of the network is using several new ideas and combines probabilistic and combinatorial arguments with analytic techniques informed by new probabilistic insights .",
    "it is crucially based on the local approximation of preferential attachment networks by a branching random walk with a killing boundary recently found in  @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the removal of a proportion of old vertices corresponds to the introduction of a second killing boundary . on the one hand",
    "this adds an additional level of complexity to the process , as the mathematical understanding of critical phenomena in branching models on finite intervals is only just emerging , see for example  @xcite . on",
    "the other hand compactness of the typespace for this branching process opens up new avenues that are exploited , for example , in the form of spectral estimates based on rather subtle information on the shape of principal eigenfunctions of an operator associated with the branching process .",
    "the established mathematical model for a large network is a sequence @xmath11 of ( random or deterministic ) graphs @xmath12 with vertex set @xmath13 and an edge set @xmath14 consisting of ( ordered or unordered ) edges between the vertices .",
    "we assume that the size @xmath15 of the vertex set is increasing to infinity in probability , so that results about the limiting behaviour in the sequence of graphs may be seen as predictions for the behaviour of large networks . in all cases of interest here",
    "the asymptotic number of edges per vertex is finite so that the topology in a bounded neighbourhood of a typical vertex is not affected by the overall size of the graph . as a result ,",
    "metrics based on the local features of the graph typically stabilize .",
    "an important example for this is the proportion of vertices with a given degree in @xmath12 , which in the relevant models converges and allows us to talk about the asymptotic degree distribution .",
    "the mathematical models of power law networks therefore have an asymptotic degree distribution with the probability of degree @xmath5 decaying like  @xmath6 , as @xmath16 , for some @xmath17 .",
    "our focus here is on the global properties emerging in network models with asymptotic power law degree distributions .",
    "a crucial global feature of a network is its connectivity , and in particular the existence of a large connected component . to describe this ,",
    "we denote by @xmath18 a connected component in @xmath12 with maximal number of nodes .",
    "the graph sequence @xmath11 has _ a giant component _ if there exists a constant @xmath19 such that @xmath20 where the convergence holds in probability .",
    "we remark that for the models usually considered the issue is not the convergence itself but the positivity of the limit  @xmath21 .",
    "if a giant component exists and the length of the shortest path between any two vertices in the largest component of @xmath12 is asymptotically bounded by a multiple of @xmath3 , the network is called _",
    "small_. if it is asymptotically bounded by a constant multiple of @xmath2 , the network is called _",
    "ultrasmall_.    to model a _ random attack _ on the network we keep each vertex in @xmath12 independently with probability  @xmath22 $ ] and otherwise we remove it from the vertex set together with all its adjacent edges , i.e.  we run _ vertex percolation _ on @xmath12 with _ retention probability _ @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting graph is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "a simple coupling argument shows that there exists a critical parameter @xmath25 $ ] such that the sequence @xmath26 has a giant component if @xmath27 , and it does not have a giant component if @xmath28 . if @xmath29 , i.e.  if the giant component can not be destroyed by percolation with any positive retention parameter , then the network is called _",
    "robust_. to study resilience of networks to _ targeted attack _ we look at models in which the construction of the network favours certain vertices in such a way that these privileged vertices have a better chance of getting a high degree than others .",
    "when @xmath12 is a network on @xmath1 vertices , we label these by @xmath30 to @xmath1 and assume that vertices are ordered in decreasing order of privilege .",
    "this assumption allows an attacker to target the most privileged vertices without knowledge of the entire graph . the _ damaged graph _",
    "@xmath31 , for some @xmath32 , is obtained from @xmath12 by removal of all vertices with label less or equal than @xmath33 together with all adjacent edges . in particular ,",
    "the new vertex set is @xmath34 .",
    "we investigate the problem of vulnerability of random networks to targeted attack in the context of _ preferential attachment networks_. this class of models has been popularised by barabsi and albert  @xcite and has received considerable attention in the scientific literature .",
    "the idea is that a sequence of graphs is constructed by successively adding vertices .",
    "together with a new vertex , edges are introduced by connecting it to existing vertices at random with a probability depending on the degree of the existing node ; the higher the degree the more likely the connection . despite the relatively simple principle on which this model is based it shows a good match of global features with real networks .",
    "for example , the asymptotic degree distributions follow a power law , and if the power law exponent satisfies @xmath35 , then the network is robust and ultrasmall",
    ". variations in the attachment probabilities allow for tuning of the power law exponent  @xmath7 .",
    "the first mathematically rigorous study of resilience in preferential attachment networks was performed by bollobs and riordan  @xcite for the so - called lcd model .",
    "this model variant has the advantage of having an explicit static description , which makes it much easier to analyse than models that have only a dynamic description .",
    "it also has a fixed power law exponent @xmath8 , hence , bollobas and riordan  @xcite prove only results for this specific exponent .",
    "they show that in this case the network is robust and identify a critical proportion @xmath36 such that the removal of the oldest @xmath37 oldest vertices leads to the destruction of the giant component if and only if @xmath38 .",
    "note that this is not in line with the notion of vulnerability that we are interested in , as we only want to remove a _",
    "small _ proportion of old vertices .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the question of vulnerability in the following model variant , introduced in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath39 be the set of nonnegative integers and fix a function @xmath40 , which we call the _ attachment rule_. the most important case is if @xmath41 is affine , i.e.  @xmath42 for parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 , but non - linear functions are allowed .",
    "given an attachment rule @xmath41 , we define a growing sequence @xmath45 of random graphs by the following dynamics :    * start with one vertex labelled @xmath30 and no edges , i.e.  @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 ,  @xmath48 ; * given the graph @xmath12 , we construct @xmath49 from @xmath12 by adding a new vertex labelled @xmath50 and , for each @xmath51 independently , inserting the directed edge @xmath52 with probability @xmath53    formally we are dealing with a sequence of directed graphs but all edges point from the younger to the older vertex .",
    "hence , directions can be recreated from the undirected , labelled graph . for all structural questions , particularly regarding connectivity and the length of shortest paths , we regard @xmath54 as an undirected network .",
    "dereich and mrters consider in @xcite concave attachment rules  @xmath41 . denoting the asymptotic slope of @xmath41 by @xmath55",
    "they show that for @xmath56 the sequence @xmath54 has an asymptotic degree distribution which follows a power law with exponent @xmath57 in the case @xmath58 , or equivalently @xmath59 , there exists a critical percolation parameter @xmath60 such that @xmath61 has a giant component if and only if @xmath62 .",

    "this effect is stronger the closer @xmath81 is to @xmath82 .",
    "this result might be perceived as slightly counterintuitive since the preferential attachment becomes stronger as @xmath81 increases and therefore we might expect older nodes to be more privileged and a targeted attack to be more effective than in the small @xmath81 regime . however , the effect of the stronger preferential attachment is more than compensated by the fact that networks with a small value of @xmath81 have a ( stochastically ) smaller number of edges and are therefore a - priori more vulnerable .",
    "note also that @xmath80 may be equal to @xmath30 if @xmath4 is not sufficiently small in which case implies that the damaged network has no giant component . in the case",
    "@xmath83 the implied constants in can be made explicit as and , but we can not show that they match asymptotically .",

    "theorem  [ thm : degrees ] shows in particular that by removing a proportion of the oldest vertices we have removed all vertices with a degree bigger than a given constant multiple of @xmath3 .",
    "this justifies the comparison of our vulnerability results with empirical studies of real world networks such as  @xcite , in which all nodes whose degree exceeds a given threshold are removed .",

    "it is instructive to continue the comparison of the damaged and undamaged networks in the setup of this branching process . in @xcite , where the undamaged network is analysed , the branching random walk has only _ one _ killing boundary on the right .",
    "it turns out that on the set of survival the leftmost particle drifts away from the killing boundary , such that it does not feel the boundary anymore . as a consequence , the unkilled process carries all information needed to determine whether the killed branching random walk survives with positive probability and , therefore , whether the network has a giant component .",

    "this means that in the branching random walk without killing , particles produce many offspring to the right , but only a few to the left .",
    "hence , if a particle is located near the left killing boundary it is very fertile , but its offspring are mostly located further to the right and are therefore less fertile . a particle near the right killing boundary , however , has itself a small number of offspring , which then however have a good chance of being fertile . as a result ,",
    "the optimal survival strategy for a particle is to have an ancestral line of particles whose locations are alternating between positions near the left and the right killing boundary .",
    "this intuition is the basis for our proofs .",
    "continuing more formally , for the proof of theorem  [ thm : pc ] it can be shown that positivity of the survival probability can be characterised in terms of the largest eigenvalue  @xmath217 of an operator that describes the spatial distribution of offspring of a given particle .",

    "it would be of interest to understand the behaviour of @xmath223 as @xmath78 .",
    "our methods can be applied to this case , but the resulting bounds are very rough .",
    "the reason is that in this regime the preferential attachment is much weaker , and the intuitive idea underlying our estimates gives a less accurate picture .",
    "the idea of proof in theorem  [ thm : distances ] is based on the branching process comparison , too . to bound the probability that two typical vertices @xmath224 and @xmath225 are connected by a path of length at most  @xmath226 , we look at the expected number of such paths .",
    "this is given by the number of vertices in a ball of radius @xmath227 around @xmath224 in the graph metric , multiplied with the probability that such a vertex connects to  @xmath225 . by our branching process heuristics , the size of the ball is also equal to the number of vertices in the first @xmath227 generations of the branching random walk , which can be determined as the largest eigenvalue  @xmath228 of the associated operator to the power @xmath226 .",
    "the probability of connecting any vertex with index at least @xmath33 to @xmath225 is bounded by @xmath229 , where @xmath89 is the maximal degree in the network . since @xmath230 by theorem  [ thm : degrees ] , this implies that the probability of a connection is bounded from above by @xmath231 and therefore goes to zero if @xmath232 , @xmath233 , which yields the result .",
    "theorem  [ thm : degrees ] is relatively soft by comparison .",
    "the independence of the indegrees of distinct vertices allows us to study them separately and we again use the continuous approximation to describe the expected empirical indegree evolution . the limit theorem for the empirical distribution itself follows from a standard concentration argument .",

    "<S> scale - free networks with small power law exponent are known to be robust , meaning that their qualitative topological structure can not be altered by random removal of even a large proportion of nodes . by contrast , it has been argued in the science literature that such networks are highly vulnerable to a targeted attack , and removing a small number of key nodes in the network will dramatically change the topological structure . </S>",
    "<S> here we analyse a class of preferential attachment networks in the robust regime and prove four main results supporting this claim : after removal of an arbitrarily small proportion @xmath0 of the oldest nodes ( 1 ) the asymptotic degree distribution has exponential instead of power law tails ; ( 2 ) the largest degree in the network drops from being of the order of a power of the network size  @xmath1 to being just logarithmic in  @xmath1 ; ( 3 ) the typical distances in the network increase from order @xmath2 to order @xmath3 ; and ( 4 ) the network becomes vulnerable to random removal of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , all our results explicitly quantify the dependence on the proportion @xmath4 of removed vertices . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we show that the critical proportion of nodes that have to be retained for survival of the giant component undergoes a steep increase as @xmath4 moves away from zero , and a comparison of this result with similar ones for other networks reveals the existence of two different universality classes of robust network models . </S>",
    "<S> the key technique in our proofs is a local approximation of the network by a branching random walk with two killing boundaries , and an understanding of the particle genealogies in this process , which enters into estimates for the spectral radius of an associated  operator .    </S>",
