    "communication between individuals is a fundament of human society . nowadays technologies such as sensor devices and online communication services provide us with records of interaction between individuals , including face - to - face conversations , e - mail exchanges , and phone calls , in massive amounts .",
    "such data often consist of a sequence of interaction events . each event",
    "is represented by a triplet , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ids of two individuals involved in the event and the time of the event . one traditional way to characterize such data is to represent them as an aggregated network , in which the links are drawn between two nodes ( _ i.e. _ , individuals ) that communicate in at least one event , and investigate structural properties of the aggregated static networks  @xcite .",
    "another and richer representation of this type of data is to model them as temporal networks , in which the links between two nodes exist only at the time of an event  @xcite .",
    "effects of temporal networks on contagious phenomena , such as infectious diseases and rumors , have been investigated by various authors . to simulate spreading dynamics on temporal networks",
    ", we read the events in an empirical event sequence one by one in the chronological order and possibly update the states ( _ e.g. _ , susceptible and infected ) of the two nodes involved in the event .",
    "karsai and colleagues simulated the susceptible - infected ( si ) model on temporal networks and found that bursty activity patterns slow down contagions  @xcite ; bursty activity patterns are identified with a long - tailed distribution of the interevent intervals ( ieis )  @xcite .",
    "the slowing down occurs because , at an arbitrary time point , the average time to the next event is longer for the long - tailed iei distribution than for the exponential iei distribution with the same mean . in other words , after an individual gets infected , it tends to take longer time to infect the neighbors under the long - tailed as compared to exponential iei distribution .",
    "other numerical  @xcite and analytical  @xcite results also support that the long - tailed iei distribution mitigates contagion .",
    "however , the burstiness was reported to accelerate contagion on a different data set  @xcite and a different type of epidemic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the effect of the burstiness on contagious processes is still elusive .    in the present study",
    ", we show that bursty activity patterns facilitate epidemic spreading in a variant of the deterministic threshold model  @xcite . in standard models of epidemics including the si , susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) , and susceptible - exposed - infected - recovered ( seir ) models , which have been employed in the literature cited above ,",
    "a susceptible node gets infected from an infected neighbor with a constant probability in an event , regardless of the amount of exposure to infected neighbors in the past .",
    "however , history - dependent thresholding effects in which the thresholding operates on the concentration of the pathogen have been reported for some infectious diseases mediated by bacteria , such as the tuberculosis and the dysentery  @xcite . in the case of information propagation",
    ", the exposure to the information increases one s interest in a topic , and the attractiveness of a topic decays in time in the absence of stimulus  @xcite .",
    "we may need multiple interactions to persuade others to do something , and repeated contacts in a short period can be more effective than those dispersed over a long period . to consider this type of infection",
    ", we generalize the deterministic threshold model to the case of history dependence and memory decay and simulate the proposed model on temporal network data .",
    "each node @xmath0 is assumed to have an internal variable denoted by @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , which represents , for example , the concentration of a pathogen in the individual or the individual s interest in a topic .",
    "initially , @xmath3 to equal to zero for all @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that node @xmath0 is in the susceptible ( @xmath4 ) state before @xmath3 exceeds a threshold value @xmath5 and that node @xmath0 is in the infected ( @xmath6 ) state once @xmath3 exceeds @xmath5 .",
    "each node is in either state .",
    "nodes in state @xmath6 never return to state @xmath4 ; our model is an extension of the si model .",
    "therefore , the number of @xmath6 nodes monotonically increases in time .    when node @xmath0 in state @xmath4 interacts with an @xmath6 node through an event , @xmath3 is increased by unity . in the absence of interaction with @xmath6 nodes , @xmath3 is assumed to decay exponentially in time . in other words",
    ", @xmath3 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the time of an event between node @xmath0 and an @xmath6 node , and @xmath9 is the decay time constant .",
    "an example time course of @xmath10 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_i ] .",
    "the model contains two parameters @xmath9 and @xmath5 and can be regarded as a variant of the deterministic threshold model  @xcite .",
    "although we assume that all the nodes have the same values of @xmath9 and @xmath5 for simplicity , it is straightforward to generalize the model in the case of heterogeneous parameter values .",
    "we simulate our model numerically on empirical temporal networks in the following way . at @xmath11",
    ", we select a node as initial seed and set its state to @xmath6 .",
    "all the other nodes are initially in state @xmath4 .",
    "then , we chronologically read the event sequence one by one and update @xmath3 and the states of the two nodes involved in the event . because our model is deterministic , the final infection size ( _ i.e. _ , fraction of @xmath6 nodes at time @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the time of the last event in the data set ) , denoted by @xmath13 , is unique for given initial seed @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath5 .",
    "we use two data sets .",
    "the first data set , called conference in the following , is the face - to - face conversation log between attendees of a scientific conference  @xcite .",
    "the second data set , called email , is the record of e - mail exchanges between the members of a university  @xcite . in the second data",
    "set , we neglect the direction of the interaction ( _ i.e. _ , from sender to receiver ) for simplicity",
    ". the basic statistics of the data sets are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : datasets ] .",
    "in figs .  [ fig : i_i](a ) and [ fig : i_i](b ) , we plot the dependence of final infection size @xmath14 on @xmath9 and @xmath5 for initial seed node @xmath15 having the maximum number of events in conference and email data sets , respectively . in the blank parameter region ,",
    "no infection occurs such that @xmath16 .",
    "naturally , @xmath14 increases with @xmath9 and decreases with @xmath5 .    next , we carry out the same set of simulations on the randomized temporal networks for the sake of comparison . to this end",
    ", we use the so - called randomly - permuted - times randomization , in which the time stamps of all the events are randomly shuffled  @xcite .",
    "the randomization eliminates temporal properties of the original temporal networks such as bursty activity patterns , daily and weekly patterns , and the pairwise correlations of the ieis , whereas it conserves all the properties of the aggregated networks , _",
    "i.e. _ , weighted adjacency matrix .    for the randomized temporal networks , the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath9 and @xmath5 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : i_i](c ) and [ fig : i_i](d ) for conference and email data sets , respectively .",
    "we find that the parameter region in which infection occurs is larger for the original temporal networks ( colored regions in figs .",
    "[ fig : i_i](a ) and [ fig : i_i](b ) ) than for the randomized temporal networks ( colored regions in figs .",
    "[ fig : i_i](c ) and [ fig : i_i](d ) ) for intermediate values of @xmath9 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 for conference and email data sets , respectively ) . in the original data sets ,",
    "the nodes tend to have many events in bursty periods and be quiescent in other periods .",
    "the randomization procedure eliminates bursty activity patterns .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 can reach @xmath5 in such a bursty period for the original but not randomized temporal networks if @xmath9 and @xmath5 take intermediate values . in the randomized data sets , @xmath19 tends to decay faster than it grows , although the number of events per node is the same between the original and randomized data .    for email data set , @xmath14 for the randomized data set ( fig .",
    "[ fig : i_i](d ) ) is larger than that for the original data set ( fig .",
    "[ fig : i_i](c ) ) when @xmath9 is large and @xmath5 is small .",
    "this is mainly because the randomization increases the reachability ratio from initial seed @xmath15 to a large extent .",
    "the reachability ratio from a node is defined as the fraction of nodes that we can reach from the node by tracing the events in the chronological order  @xcite .",
    "if every event can elicit infection , which is the case when @xmath9 is large and @xmath5 is small , @xmath14 is approximated by the reachability ratio from node @xmath15 .",
    "the reachability ratio from node @xmath20 in email data set is equal to 0.7458 and 0.9981 for the original and randomized data sets , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the reachability ratio from node @xmath21 in conference data set is equal to 0.9642 and 1 for the original and randomized data sets , respectively ; the difference is smaller than in the case of email data set .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : avg_i ] , the average final infection size @xmath22 , defined as the average of @xmath13 over all the nodes  @xmath0 , is plotted as a function of @xmath9 for two values of @xmath5 for each data set .",
    "figure [ fig : avg_i ] indicates that @xmath22 for the original temporal networks is larger than that for the randomized temporal networks for a broad range of @xmath9 for both data sets .    in the bond percolation on static networks ,",
    "the probability that single bonds are open ( independent of different bonds ) is the sole parameter that determines the possibility that the entire network has a giant component  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this picture , we hypothesize that the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : i_i ] and [ fig : avg_i ] are largely explained by the bursty nature of events on single links .",
    "in other words , we speculate that the structure of the aggregated networks or correlation between event sequences on different links do not much influence the results . to test the hypothesis",
    ", we separately examine the event sequence on each link .",
    "for each link , _",
    "i.e. _ , node pair @xmath23 with at least one event , @xmath24 is defined as the time required for node @xmath0 to be infected since node @xmath25 has been infected .",
    "we emphasize that we do not consider influences from other nodes on @xmath0 in this analysis .",
    "we take the time average of @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath26 , over @xmath27 .",
    "a problem with the time averaging is that @xmath24 is indefinite for sufficiently large @xmath28 because @xmath0 does not get infected by time @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we adopt the boundary condition in which the first events between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath25 virtually replay after @xmath29 . we denote the time of the first event between @xmath0 and @xmath25 by @xmath30 .",
    "if we temporarily set @xmath31 , it takes at most @xmath32 for node @xmath0 starting with @xmath33 to be infected from node @xmath25 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the last time before which @xmath24 is finite .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath36 for @xmath34 .",
    "this boundary condition is the same as that is used in ref .",
    "@xcite for defining the average temporal path length .",
    "if @xmath37 is indefinite ( _ i.e. _ , infection never occurs between @xmath0 and @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 is set to infinite .",
    "we define denoted by @xmath38 as the average of @xmath39 over the 20% links with the largest numbers of events , because the majority of the links possesses a small number of events in both data sets .",
    "this thresholding leaves 441 and 6,932 links for conference and email data sets , respectively .",
    "@xmath38 for the original and randomized temporal networks are shown for various @xmath9 and @xmath5 values for conference ( figs .",
    "[ fig : firing_rate](a ) and [ fig : firing_rate](b ) ) and email ( figs .",
    "[ fig : firing_rate](c ) and [ fig : firing_rate](d ) ) data sets . because infection can be induced only through a single link in the present simulations , we examined @xmath5 values that are much smaller than those used in figs .",
    "[ fig : i_i ] and [ fig : avg_i ] . for both data sets , @xmath38 for the original temporal networks ( figs .",
    "[ fig : firing_rate](a ) and [ fig : firing_rate](c ) ) is larger than that for the randomized networks ( figs .",
    "[ fig : firing_rate](b ) and [ fig : firing_rate](d ) ) for intermediate values of @xmath9 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 for conference and email data sets , respectively ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath38 is consistent with the results of the network - based simulations ( figs .",
    "[ fig : i_i ] and [ fig : avg_i ] ) .",
    "we numerically simulated a variant of the deterministic threshold model on empirical temporal networks .",
    "we found that the average final infection size for the empirical temporal networks is larger than those for the randomized temporal networks in a broad parameter region ( figs .",
    "[ fig : i_i ] and [ fig : avg_i ] ) .",
    "the bursty nature of the ieis on single links has a sufficient explanatory power for the results of the network - based simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : firing_rate ] ) .",
    "the burstiness promoted epidemic spreading when the decay exponent @xmath9 takes an intermediate value ( @xmath40 and @xmath18 ( seconds ) for conference and email data sets , respectively ) .",
    "this range of @xmath9 may be practical because the influence of a pathogen that an individual has received may last for hours to days .",
    "the finding that the burstiness facilitates the spreading also sheds light on a function of the redundant interaction events .",
    "we previously found that about 80% of the events are redundant in the sense that they affect little on bridging efficient temporal paths in conference data set  @xcite .",
    "however , for the spreading dynamics in our model , such redundant events play a crucial role in increasing @xmath10 within bursty periods .",
