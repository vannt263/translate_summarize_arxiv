    "the present - day stellar mass of galaxies is an integral of the history of star formation and mergers over the life time of galaxies .",
    "therefore , the rate at which galaxies convert their gas reservoir into stars is one of the important factors that drives galaxy evolution .",
    "we have seen in the milky way and other nearby galaxies that star formation occurs exclusively in molecular clouds ( gmcs , blitz 1993 ) . in a simplified scheme ,",
    "these clouds contract under their self - gravity and finally form stars .",
    "the contraction time - scale can be estimated to be proportional to the free - fall time , which is a function of gas volume density .",
    "therefore , it is logical to connect the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the gas volume density ( schmidt 1959 ) .",
    "however , the gas volume density is not an observable quantity in extragalactic studies .",
    "instead , we can use the gas surface density .",
    "previous studies showed that sfr surface density correlates with the molecular gas surface density as @xmath4 with an exponent of @xmath5 ( bigiel et al .",
    "2008 , leroy et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "a linear relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 implies that the _ average _ molecular gas consumption time - scale or gas depletion time , defined as @xmath8 , is constant , with typical value of @xmath9 gyr . the star formation efficiency ( sfe )",
    "is the inverse of @xmath10 and measures the ability of gas to form stars per unit gas mass .",
    "shorter @xmath10 means gas forms stars more efficiently . in this paper , we use both terms interchangeably .    the observed scatter in the kennicutt ",
    "schmidt diagram ( @xmath11 dex , kennicutt 1998 ) means that for a given amount of molecular gas , some galaxies or parts of galaxies ( on a @xmath11 kpc scale ) are more efficient in forming stars than the others by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "the conditions or parameters that drive the variations of @xmath10 are the main issue that is addressed in this paper . in this respect ,",
    "we need more than just the tracers of sfr ( h@xmath13+ir or uv+ir flux ) and molecular gas density ( co flux ) .",
    "therefore , in @xmath14 we briefly describe the califa and edge surveys that gather other physical properties of galaxies , such as stellar surface densities and metallicities .",
    "then , we analyze if any of these parameters correlate with the sfe or @xmath10 in @xmath15 .",
    "the calar alto legacy integral field area ( califa ) is an optical integral field unit ( ifu ) survey of @xmath16 local galaxies at @xmath17 .",
    "the samples are selected from the sdss database based on their diameter in @xmath18-band ( @xmath19 ) , so that they fit well within the ifu field - of - view .",
    "a detailed description of the survey is presented by sanchez et al .",
    "the main data products of califa survey are various properties and kinematic maps of the stellar populations and ionized gas .",
    "we select 176 galaxies from the califa samples , based on their brightness in the wise @xmath20 m band , to be observed in the ( @xmath21 ) @xmath0co and @xmath2co spectral lines using the carma observatory in the e - array configuration ( @xmath22 resolution ) .",
    "then , we chose 125 of them based on @xmath0co detections to be observed in the d - array configuration to achieve higher angular resolution ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 kpc ) that is closely matched to the califa resolution ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this extragalactic database for galaxy evolution ( edge ) survey is the first major , resolved co survey matched to an ifu survey .",
    "the survey descriptions will be presented elsewhere ( bolatto et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the main data products of the edge survey are the surface density and kinematic maps of the molecular gas .",
    "we make use of the califa and edge data products to investigate if there is any systematic trend between the depletion time and other galaxy physical properties .",
    "we derive the sfr surface densities using the h@xmath13 line , following the prescription of calzetti et al .",
    "the h@xmath13 lines have been corrected for dust extinction by using the balmer decrement method and the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) extinction curve .",
    "the co integrated luminosities are converted to the molecular gas surface densities by applying a constant co - to - h@xmath26 conversion factor , @xmath27 , of 4.3 @xmath28 ( k km s@xmath29 pc@xmath30)@xmath29 .",
    "additionally , we can derive the gas - phase metallicity by using the ratio of strong emission lines ( e.g. , kewley & dopita 2002 ) , and the stellar mass surface density , @xmath31 , by applying the stellar population synthesis technique to each line - of - sight spectrum .",
    "we divide our studies into three parts : global ( galaxy - by - galaxy ) , local ( @xmath32 kpc scales ) , and radial analyses as a function of distance from the galaxy centers .",
    "globally , @xmath10 increases with the stellar mass , @xmath33 ( left panel of figure[fig1 ] ) . here",
    ", we compute @xmath10 by adding all of the molecular gas mass and dividing it by the sum of all star formation within the galaxy .",
    "more massive galaxies tend to have longer @xmath10 , in agreement with the cold gass result ( solid red line in figure[fig1 ] , saintonge et al .",
    "they argued that the galaxies that show reduced @xmath10 are those undergoing minor starbursts due to distant tidal encounters , variations in the intergalactic medium accretion rate , or secular processes within galactic discs , while morphological quenching and agn feedback prevent the molecular gas from forming stars in the high mass galaxies .    by using heracles samples , leroy et al .",
    "( 2013 ) proposed that the correlation in the @xmath34 diagram can be explained _ partially _ by a variation in @xmath27 with respect to the dust - to - gas ratio , and hence , gas - phase metallicity , @xmath35 . according to the @xmath36 relation ( tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) , less massive galaxies have lower @xmath35 , and therefore , higher @xmath27 ( bolatto et al . 2013 ) . increasing @xmath27 will shift the low mass galaxies data points upward in the @xmath34 diagram to make a flatter slope .",
    "however , the correlation can not be completely removed , so that a variation in @xmath27 is not the only explanation .",
    "a check of how robust our result is with respect to the variation of @xmath27 will be done in a future work ( utomo et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the enhanced sfe at the centers has also been pointed out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* leroy et al . ( 2013 ) ) in the heracles samples .",
    "they mentioned that this enhanced efficiency coincides with the higher fraction of the @xmath0co(@xmath37 ) over @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) line intensities , which is an indicator of more excited gas and higher gas temperature at the centers .",
    "furthermore , variations in @xmath27 exaggerate the drop , so this enhancement must be genuine . in the future , we will investigate what causes the drop of @xmath10 at the centers , and whether this enhancement of sfe is linked to the morphology of the bulges ( classical vs. pseudo - bulges and barred vs. unbarred ) and the gas free - fall time due to the underlying weight of stars and gas ."
