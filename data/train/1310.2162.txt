    "in the constellation of the brilliant elementary particle experiments of the last decades , the b - factories , belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite , were ones of the most remarkable .",
    "their results on cp - violation in b - mesons prove the validity of the km mechanism , which inventors , m.  kobayashi and t.  maskawa , won the nobel prize in physics in 2008 .",
    "belle was successful not only in cp - violation studies .",
    "the huge amount of the data collected by the belle detector ( more than one billion @xmath1-pairs ) allows to make a number of discoveries in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "more than 10 new quarkonium - like states were discovered including puzzling x(3872 ) state and new charged z - resonances which do not fit conventional quarkonium model .",
    "the belle successor , belle ii experiment  @xcite , is aimed to collect statistics sample of 50 ab@xmath2 by the end of 2022 .",
    "major accelerator upgrade includes changes of the crossing angle ( 22  mrad to 83  mrad ) , introduction of the nano - beam scheme , _",
    "i.e. _ decreasing of horizontal emittance ( @xmath3  nm to @xmath4  nm for positrons and @xmath5  nm to @xmath6  nm for electrons ) and beta - functions at ip ( @xmath7 from @xmath8  mm to @xmath9  mm ) , rising beam currents ( from @xmath10  a to @xmath11  a for positrons and from @xmath12  a to @xmath13  a for electrons ) .",
    "the downside of these changes is significant rise of backgrounds .",
    "higher luminosity delivered by the accelerator requires adequate upgrade of the detector components to sustain effective operation at new environment . new belle ii detector",
    "have 2-layer depfet pixel ( pxd ) and 4-layer dssd silicon strip ( svd ) detectors for vertexing .",
    "tracking is done with the upgraded drift chamber ( cdc ) with increased size and smaller cells .",
    "particle identification is done with time of propagation counter ( top ) combining advantages of the excellent time resolution time - of - fight system and erenkov ring imaging babar - like dirc in barrel region and aerogel rich ( arich ) detector with focusing radiator in endcaps .",
    "electromagnetic calorimeter with new electronics for barrel and pure csi crystals instead of csi(tl ) in endcaps is able to operate at much higher backgrounds .",
    "muon and @xmath0 system ( klm ) is replaced with new one based on scintillator technique in endcaps and in two innermost barrel layers .",
    "the @xmath0 and muon detector ( klm ) of the belle detector consists of an alternating sandwich of @xmath14-cm thick iron plates and active detector elements located outside of the superconducting solenoid .",
    "the octagonal barrel covers the polar angle range from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , while the endcaps extend this coverage from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "there are 14 detector layers and 14 iron plates in each endcap .",
    "each layer operates independently .",
    "the belle klm is based on resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) technology .",
    "high voltage is distributed over the two glass electrodes with bulk resistivity of @xmath19 but transparent to the fast electric pulses .",
    "the throughgoing charged particle ionizes gas along its track and form streamer discharge in the gas - filled gap between electrodes .",
    "the signal induced on the couple of orthogonal pick - up strip electrodes is large enough to be discriminated without amplification .    in the belle environment the performance of the most of the barrel layers was about @xmath20 decreasing down to @xmath21 for the innermost one . for",
    "the endcap efficiency ranges between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the lowest numbers are for the outermost layers where the background is higher and came mostly from the accelerator tunnel .",
    "since at high background loads of belle ii experiment efficiency of the rpcs drops to zero , new belle ii endcap klm system ( eklm ) utilizes another technique based on scintillator strips read - out by wavelength shifting ( wls ) fibers .",
    "the light is registered by novel devices  silicon photomultipliers ( sipm ) .",
    "the base element of the new system is scintillator strip of polystyrene doped with ptp ( @xmath24 ) and popop ( @xmath25 ) produced by extrusion technique at `` uniplast '' enterprise ( vladimir , russia ) .",
    "it has a cross - section of @xmath26  mm@xmath27 and length varying from @xmath28  mm to @xmath29  mm .",
    "in total there are 41 different strip lengths .",
    "diffusive reflective cover of the surface is produced by chemical etching .",
    "a @xmath30 mm wide and @xmath31 mm deep groove is milled in each strip to hold the wls fiber .",
    "an optical contact between the scintillator and kuraray y11 wls fiber put into the groove is provided by optical gel sl-1 by surel ( st .- peterburg , russia ) .",
    "one wls fiber end is connected to a photosensor while the other is mirrored using a silver - shine paint .",
    "the groove is covered by aluminized reflective tape .",

    "the photosensor is hamamatsu sipm ( s10362 - 13 - 025ckx ) .",
    "it is pressed against the polished fiber end by the rubber ring in the connector .",
