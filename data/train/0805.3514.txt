    "the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) has had wide applications in the field of intermediate energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the basic assumption is that when two heavy ions collide , after pre - equilibrium emission , they form a compound system with given mass number @xmath0 , charge number @xmath1 and given energy @xmath2 .",
    "this system will expand and break up into different composites . in this expanded volume the nuclear interaction between different composites can be neglected and coulomb interaction can be included in an approximate way . assuming that the populations of different channels are solely given by statistical weights in the available phase space , the average yield of given species with a neutron number @xmath3 and proton number @xmath4 can be computed by monte - carlo simulation .",
    "details may be found in @xcite .",
    "many versions of the monte - carlo simulations are possible . for example , one can choose the freeze - out volume to be dependent on the multiplicity of a channel . for reactions where",
    "equilibrated sources are formed , the smm gives very good description of experimental data @xcite .",
    "the canonical thermodynamic model ( ctm ) characterises the disintegrating system by a temperature @xmath5 , the mass number @xmath0 , charge number @xmath1 and a fixed freeze - out volume . with these simplifications , computations of average yields of composites",
    "are straightforward and do not need monte - carlo simulations .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "this model has also been used successfully to fit experimental data @xcite .",
    "it is expected that results will be similar to those obtained from the smm . here",
    "we embark on more quantitative comparison of the results generated in the two frameworks for a few representative cases .",
    "such a comparison is long overdue .",
    "first , we give description of the ctm . for the smm more",
    "than one approach was used which will be described below .",
    "details of the computational procedures for the canonical model can be found elsewhere @xcite hence we provide here only the bare minimal .",
    "the fragmenting system has @xmath6 neutrons and @xmath1 neutrons .",
    "we consider all break - up channels ( partitions ) @xmath7 , and define @xmath8 as the number of fragments with neutron number @xmath9 and the number of protons @xmath10 .",
    "as is well known , the number of partitions of medium and heavy systems @xmath11 is enormous ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the canonical partition function for non - interacting fragments is given by @xmath12 here the sum is over all possible partitions , which satisfy the conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the partition function of one composite with neutron number @xmath9 and proton number @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the one - body partition function @xmath15 is a product of two parts : one arising from the translational motion of the composite and another from the intrinsic partition function of the composite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 mev is the average nucleon mass , and @xmath18 is the mass number of the composite ( @xmath19 ) . here",
    "@xmath20 is the volume available for translational motion ; @xmath20 will be less than @xmath21 , the volume to which the system has expanded at break up .",
    "we use @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the normal volume of nucleus with @xmath1 protons and @xmath6 neutrons .",
    "the probability of a given channel @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 the average number of composites with @xmath9 neutrons and @xmath10 protons is seen easily from the above equation to be @xmath26 the constraints @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be used to obtain different looking but equivalent recursion relations for partition functions .",
    "for example @xmath27 these recursion relations allow one to calculate @xmath28    we list now the properties of the composites used in this work .",
    "the proton and the neutron are fundamental building blocks thus @xmath29 where 2 takes care of the spin degeneracy . for deuteron ,",
    "triton , @xmath30he and @xmath31he we use @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the ground state energy of the composite and @xmath35 is the experimental spin degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "excited states for these very low mass nuclei are not included . for mass number @xmath36 and greater",
    "we use the liquid - drop formula . for nuclei in isolation",
    ", this reads @xmath37 z_{i , j}(int)=\\exp[-\\frac{f_{i , j}}{t}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 is the internal free energy of species @xmath39 : @xmath40 the expression includes the volume energy , the temperature dependent surface energy , the coulomb energy and the symmetry energy . the term @xmath41 represents contribution from excited states since the composites are at a non - zero temperature . for nuclei with @xmath42=5",
    "we include @xmath4=2 and 3 and for @xmath42=6 we include @xmath4=2,3 and 4 . for higher masses",
    "we compute the drip lines using the liquid - drop formula above and include all isotopes within these boundaries .    in the grand canonical formulation for the smm @xcite , after integrating out translational degrees of freedom , one can write the mean multiplicity of nuclear fragments with @xmath9 and @xmath10 as @xmath43 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath44 is the nucleon thermal wavelength . the chemical potentials @xmath45 and @xmath46 are found from the mass and charge constraints : @xmath47 we use the same treatment of the lightest particles with @xmath48 as in the canonical case , i.e. , the free energy is just their binding energy .",
    "however , for large fragments we take into account all possible charges starting from @xmath49 up to @xmath50 .",
    "we have checked that this extension beyond the drip line has a very small influence on final results in the range of nuclei covered by experiments .",
    "the grand canonical occupations are used for monte - carlo fragment generation in the smm .    at small excitation energies",
    "the standard smm code @xcite uses a microcanonical treatment , however , taking into account a limited number of disintegration channels : as a rule , only partitions with total fragment multiplicity @xmath51 are considered .",
    "this is a very reasonable approximation at low temperature , when the compound nucleus and low - multiplicity channels dominate .",
    "recently , a full microcanonical version of the smm using the markov chain method was introduced @xcite .",
    "it can be used for exploring all partitions without limitation .",
    "however , it is a more time consuming approach , and it is used in special cases only @xcite .    within the microcanonical ensemble",
    "the statistical weight of a partition @xmath52 is calculated as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the corresponding entropy , which depends on fragments in this partition , as well as on the excitation energy @xmath2 , mass number @xmath55 , charge @xmath56 and volume @xmath21 of the system . in the present work",
    "we follow a description which corresponds to approximate microcanonical ensemble .",
    "namely , we introduce a temperature @xmath57 characterising all final states in each partition @xmath52 .",
    "it is determined from the energy balance equation taking into account the total excitation energy @xmath2 @xcite . in the following we determine @xmath54 for the found @xmath57 by using conventional thermodynamical relations .",
    "for instance , in this work , it can be written as @xmath58 where summations are performed over all fragments of the partition @xmath52 .",
    "we enumerate all considered partitions and select one of them according to its statistical weight by the monte - carlo method .    at high excitation energy",
    "the standard smm code makes a transition to the grand - canonical ensemble , and generate partitions by monte - carlo sampling from the grand - canonical distribution @xcite . in all ensembles the long range coulomb interaction between different composites is included in the wigner - seitz approximation . for details of this incorporation",
    "see references @xcite . in all calculations later on we use the fixed break - up volume @xmath59 independently of fragment multiplicity .",
    "one major goal of this work is to compare the average yields @xmath60 of a composite with neutron number @xmath9 and proton number @xmath10 , when systems with different temperatures dissociate . in the canonical model",
    "this is simply given by eq.(4 ) .",
    "for brevity we will display most often @xmath61 . while for the ctm one needs to specify which composites are allowed in channels , this is not needed for smm simulations .",
    "we consider a medium - mass nucleus with @xmath0=73 and @xmath1=32 at low excitation energy .",
    "such a compound system can be formed by @xmath62ni projectile on @xmath63be and has actually been studied experimentally @xcite . in order to demonstrate the mass effect on the fragmentation picture we take also two - times larger sources .",
    "first , we start from low excitation energies , and consider @xmath64 mev / nucleon to perform calculations with the microcanonical version of the smm described above . at such low excitation energy",
    "the multiplicity should be low and for simplicity we restrict the microcanonical ensemble to multiplicities @xmath65 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the average @xmath57 ( see section ii ) for the excitation energy of 1 mev / nucleon is 3.13 mev .",
    "we perform the ctm calculations for this temperature .",
    "we will get an exact answer for the canonical model , but only an approximate one for the smm because of restriction of multiplicity .",
    "another reason for disagreement between the two models is that in the smm some channels , even at low multiplicity , will be just prohibited because of high coulomb barrier .",
    "we can therefore hope that when the yield @xmath60 is significant the agreement between the two models can emerge but for very small yields there will be deviations .",
    "1 shows that for important yields , the agreement between the two models is very good .",
    "this also shows that , at least in the present example , the average yields are about the same whether excitation energy per particle is kept constant or an appropriate temperature is kept fixed . in real physical processes , as we know , the compound nucleus channel ( @xmath66 ) dominates at low excitations .",
    "both models describe correctly a transition to this low - energy limit .",
    "now we turn to medium and high excitation energies , which lead to real multifragmentation . in fig .",
    "2 we compare the ctm and smm models at intermediate temperatures of 5 and 8 mev for three systems .",
    "one system is the same as before ( @xmath67 ) , another system is twice of this size ( @xmath68 ) , and the third one is more neutron rich ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the canonical model calculations are the same as before , but the smm simulations are dictated by convenience and simplicity , and are performed with the grand canonical version , as discussed . instead of excitation energy per nucleon ,",
    "we consider fixed temperature and the starting point of monte - carlo simulations is grand canonical population of composites .",
    "remarkable agreement is obtained between the two models except when @xmath70 is very small .",
    "we will comment upon the discrepancies for very small populations shortly .",
    "however , as is clear from the comparison , both models can be used in multifragmentation region .",
    "further important details about characteristics of produced fragments are given in figs .",
    "3 and 4 . for selected isotopes",
    "we compare the yields in the two models as the neutron number changes .",
    "now we are directly comparing individual values of @xmath60 rather than the sum of all isobars .",
    "we see once again , unless the multiplicities are really small , the yields are very close . given the choice of composites allowed in any channel , the ctm results are exact . in the grand canonical smm calculations we get broader isotope distributions , especially for big fragments .",
    "this feature explains the increased yield of big fragments seen in smm results in fig .  2 .",
    "the reason is that the grand - canonical ensemble increases the phase space , since it takes into account many more partitions which include exotic nuclei , and conserves the mass number and charge conservation laws on the average only .",
    "since the number of exotic nuclei is greater for large nuclei we obtain more deviation at large a and z. we can make a quite general statement : any restriction of the partition phase space lead to more narrow isotope distributions .",
    "we expect narrow distributions also for the microcanonical ensemble , since it imposes the exact energy conservation in the partitions additionally .",
    "the caloric curves , temperature @xmath5 against excitation energy @xmath71 agree very well in the two models .",
    "this dependence is very important for statistical systems , and it can be in many cases extracted experimentally via calorimetry .",
    "examples of the caloric curves are shown in fig.5 .",
    "we conclude that small differences in fragments yields do not influence global thermodynamical characteristics of the system .",
    "we have calculated the caloric curves for all three sources under consideration , and they look practically identical .",
    "the experimental identification of the difference @xmath72 mev is probably impossible .",
    "however , we would like to draw attention to the interesting mass and isospin effects which can be seen by comparing different sources , and which may be important in big and neutron rich astrophysical systems .",
    "this can be seen in fig.6 showing differences in excitation energies @xmath73 and @xmath74 versus temperature . in the region of multifragmentation ( @xmath75 mev )",
    "a bigger system has a slightly larger excitation energy per nucleon .",
    "this is a result of stronger coulomb effect in big systems .",
    "an isospin effect can also be seen at the transition from the channels with big ( compound - like ) fragments to the full multifragmentation region , i.e. , at temperatures @xmath76 mev : the neutron rich system has a slightly lower excitation energy .",
    "we have compared the yields of composites , as well as the caloric curves , in two different model prescriptions corresponding to different ensembles .",
    "generally they agree well .",
    "the smm is more versatile : one can use either the excitation energy or the temperature as the fixed parameter .",
    "it also allows for other modifications such as multiplicity dependence of the freeze - out volume .",
    "the disadvantage is that it is computationally quite involved .",
    "the canonical model is more restrictive but extremely easy to use .",
    "we have found some differences in results of different models , in particular , concerning isotope distributions .",
    "this may cause different interpretation of some experimental observables , e.g. , the isoscaling characteristics .",
    "we should remark that in this paper we analyse the yields of primary hot fragments .",
    "the subsequent de - excitation of these excited fragments must be taken into account in interpretation of experimental data @xcite .",
    "this may lead to additional deviations between predictions of microcanonical and canonical / grandcanonical ensembles , since the microcanonical smm treatment allows for temperature fluctuations in different partitions .    in this respect ,",
    "the important question is what statistical ensemble would be preferable for analysis of experimental characteristics sensitive to the kind of ensemble .",
    "the answer can be provided by experimental information only . if the data have clear evidences of production of a thermal source with well determined @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 the microcanonical ensemble is justified .",
    "if one can speak only about exact @xmath0 and @xmath1 conservations , the canonical ensemble is the best .",
    "if experiment can give only average values for parameters of the thermal source , the grand canonical model can be applied .",
    "moreover , as is well known , the preequilibrium dynamical stage can provide a very broad distribution in parameters of the thermal sources . including all",
    "this distribution may have a greater impact on the results , than selection of a particular ensemble . in the case of an experimental uncertainty with parameters of the thermal source",
    ", we believe , the evaluation of experimental data should include fitting the data within one of the statistical models , and addressing physical characteristics which are universal for all ensembles , like break - up volume and internal properties of hot primary fragments .",
