    "since their discovery in 1921 @xcite , the diffuse intersteller bands ( dibs ) have remained the longest known interstellar absorption features without a positive identification .",
    "there have been several hundred dibs discovered to date @xcite .",
    "the dibs span the visible spectrum between 4000 and 13000   . despite no positive identifications ,",
    "several likely organic molecular candidates have emerged as the sources of the dibs , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , fullerenes , long carbon chains , and polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles ( panhs ) @xcite .",
    "the organic - molecular origin of the dibs may give them an importance to astrobiology ; they are now considered an important early constituent to the inventory of organic compounds on earth @xcite .",
    "there are several environmental factors that are known to enhance or inhibit dib strengths .",
    "thus , measuring dib strengths can give clues to the environments of galaxies like those with high neutral hydrogen ( ) content , known as damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) .",
    "measuring dib strengths allow researchers to explore the quantities of gas , metallicity , dust , and radiation in galaxies and their influence on the strengths of the bands .",
    "furthermore , observing dibs in galaxies at a higher redshift , @xmath1 , ( distance or lookback time related to the expansion of the universe ) allows us to test the evolution of these organics in cosmic time .",
    "two important environmental factors that are often probed in galaxies are the content and the reddening .",
    "the content in dlas is typically measured as a column density via their lyman-@xmath0 line in absorption , as observed using a bright background source such as a quasar .",
    "the column density is the number of atoms of a certain element as seen along a line - of - sight projected to a unit area at the observer ( typically in units of atoms @xmath2 and denoted as @xmath3 ( ) for neutral hydrogen ) .",
    "the reddening is a measure of the dust content in the galactic environment .",
    "reddening is expressed as @xmath4 , or the magnitude of blue light minus visible light observed relative to what is expected from typical stars or galaxies .",
    "because dust preferentially obscures blue light , a high reddening is a signature for a high dust content .",
    "@xmath3 ( ) is a measure of the gas phase and @xmath4 is a measure of the dust phase of the ism in galaxies .",
    "due to their relatively weak absorption strengths , the dibs have been difficult to detect in extragalactic sources . aside from the hundreds of detections within the milky way @xcite ,",
    "dibs have been detected in the magellanic clouds @xcite , seven starburst galaxies @xcite , the active galaxy centaurus a via supernova 1986a @xcite , spiral galaxy ngc 1448 via supernovae 2001el and 2003hn @xcite , one dla galaxy at @xmath5 toward the quasar ao  0235 + 164 @xcite , and one galaxy selected by singly ionized calcium ( ) , j00130024 , at @xmath6 from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "we further the knowledge of dib lines in extragalactic environments by cataloguing the strengths of the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 dibs relative to the @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( ) content of each of the seven dlas in our sample .",
    "observations were obtained , with seven facilities , of seven dlas toward six qso sightlines .",
    "the facilities and instruments used for this project are the vlt / fors2 , vlt / uves , apo / dis , keck / hires , wht / isis , and gemini / gmos - s .",
    "there are two detections included in this work , the @xmath125705 and @xmath125780 dibs first reported by @xcite , in the @xmath5 dla toward ao  0235 + 164 .",
    "for all other dlas in our sample , we report upper limits on the @xmath124428 , @xmath125780 , @xmath125797 , @xmath126284 , and @xmath126613 dib equivalent widths .",
    "we measured the equivalent width limits using a generalized method of the @xcite technique for finding lines and limits .",
    "we compare our measured limits to the expected dib equivalent widths from the known milky way dib@xmath4 and dib@xmath3 ( ) relations @xcite . the @xmath3 ( ) quantities",
    "are known for the dlas ; however , @xcite published the only reddening known for the dla galaxies in our sample , ao  0235 + 164 , with a measured @xmath13 .",
    "we estimate the upper limit to the reddening using our equivalent width limits and the milky way dib@xmath4 correlation .",
    "our equivalent width limits are robust enough to constrain the upper reddening limits near the @xmath14 limit found by @xcite for the highest redshift dla galaxies .",
    "the results from the @xmath3 ( ) model suggests that the organics that give rise to the dibs in dlas are underabundant relative to milky way sightlines of the same hydrogen column density .",
    "1 shows this by plotting the measured equivalent widths and upper equivalent width limits for the dlas in our sample .",
    "the line is the best - fit to the milky way data from @xcite .",
    "the milky way points are observed to lie within the dotted region while the large magellanic cloud sightlines are observed to lie within the dashed region .",
    "the small magellanic cloud sightlines are all within the dot - dashed region .",
    "the @xmath126284 dib gives the best constraints and shows that this dib is at least 4 - 10 times weaker in four of our dlas compared to what is expected in the milky way . as is the case for the magellanic clouds , the milky way dib@xmath3 ( ) relation does not apply to dibs in dlas .",
    "many environmental factors can potentially work to inhibit the organics responsible for the dibs so this alone can not be used as evidence that the environments of dlas are similar to the large or small magellanic cloud .",
    "for example , the dust content , ionizing radiation , and metallicity may be quite different in dlas relative to the magellanic clouds .    from our equivalent width limits",
    "we can estimate the upper limit to the reddening assuming the milky way dib@xmath4 relation holds for dlas .",
    "there are little data on dibs in dlas ; however , @xcite create a fit to all known extragalactic points for the @xmath125780 dib .",
    "the @xmath125780 dib@xmath4 relation appears to remain valid when the extragalactic equivalent width measurements are included , although the slope is slightly steeper .",
    "our upper limits for @xmath4 yield lower limits to the gas - to - dust ratios for our dlas ; these results are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "@xmath15 are the upper limits for the reddening determined by our best equivalent width limits .",
    "the best - fit lines for the milky way and the large magellanic cloud are given from the literature .",
    "our limits are robust enough to constrain the gas - to - dust ratio for the dlas as being much higher than the milky way for four of the dlas .",
    "the discrepency between the limit and the measurement of the dla toward ao  0235 + 164 may be due to problematic measurements .",
    "our best gas - to - dust lower limit comes from the reddening constraints for the @xmath126284 dib ; however , there is a large atmospheric absorption band at the dib s expected location .",
    "it could also be that the @xmath126284 dib@xmath4 relation is different for dlas then is measured for the milky way .",
    "the reddening limits allow us to extend the results by @xcite to lower redshift dlas .",
    "the @xmath14 from @xcite appears to also be a robust result for moderate redshift dlas .",
    "despite having comparable abundances to the milky way , dla galaxies have dib strengths that are weaker than expected .",
    "the weakness of dibs in dla selected galaxies suggests that the environments of these early epoch -rich galaxies are much less suitable to create and/or sustain organic molecules .",
    "dla galaxies do have considerably lower reddening than the milky way regions where dibs are observed .",
    "our results imply that the low reddening in dlas will inhibit the dibs if they are present .",
    "reddening is dependent on dust grain sizes and abundances .",
    "it is conceivable that the organics require dust grains for their formation or are created from the same sources , such as carbon stars @xcite .",
    "a large carbon abundance may be required for the dib@xmath4 relations to hold true .",
    "therefore , it is feasible that early epoch galaxies are not conducive to the formation of the organics because they lack the necessary carbon .",
    "however , @xcite points out that the scatter in the milky way dib@xmath4 relation is real , ie not due to noise or systematic errors .",
    "thus , other environmental factors such as the local ionizing radiation field and the metallicity may be important @xcite .",
    "little is published about the radiation in the dla galaxies in our sample .",
    "their metallicities are known to be low , on the order of @xmath160.1 solar metallicity , with the exception of ao  0235 + 164 , which is metal abundant @xcite .",
    "based on published work , it is not surprising that the dla galaxy in our sample with the highest reddening and metallicity has the only detected dibs .",
    "thus , the lack of dust and metals plays a large role in inhibiting the organics in our sample of early epoch -rich galaxies ; whereas , the abundance of is not a strong determinent in their strengths .",
    "our dla selection method is not representative of all early epoch galaxies ; it is biased toward galaxies with low reddening .",
    "another selection method for early epoch galaxies may be more fruitful .",
