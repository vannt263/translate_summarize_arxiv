    "some electrons pass this target without the compton scattering . what happened with their polarization ?",
    "it is changed , since the cross section of the compton scattering depends on the product @xmath121 and unscattered electron beam contains already unequal amount of electrons with the forward and backward helicities .",
    "considering the multiple compton scattering we should take this effect into account .",
    "general formulae for this effect has been obtained in ref.@xcite ( see v.serbo talk at this workshop ) , where the variation in polarization of the unscattered electrons was considered as the result of interference of the incoming electron wave and the wave scattered at the zero angle .",
    "_ variation of @xmath122-quanta polarization in a laser wave .",
    "_    it is well known that a region with an electromagnetic field can be regarded as an anisotropic medium  @xcite .",
    "strong laser field also has such properties . as a result ,",
    "the polarization of high energy photon produced in the compton scattering may be changed during its propagation through the polarized laser target  @xcite ( see v.serbo talk at this workshop ) .",
    "this effect is large at @xmath123 ( the threshold for  production ) .",
    "note , that in the case most important for us @xmath124 the polarization of high energy circularly polarized photons is not changed when they propagate in the circularly polarized laser wave .    in principle , using two adjacent conversion regions one can produce first circular polarized photons ( using a circularly polarized laser ) and then change the circular polarization to the linear one using a linearly polarized laser .",
    "a similar effect , influence of the electromagnetic field on the polarization of high energy photons , exists also at the interaction region of photon colliders  @xcite .",
    "due to the absence of beamstrahlung , beams in  collisions can have much smaller horizontal beam sizes than in  collisions .",
    "however , even after optimization of the final focusing system the attainable  luminosity in current lc projects is determined by the attainable `` geometric '' ee  luminosity . for the `` nominal '' beam parameters ( the same as in  collisions ) and optimum final focus systems the luminosity @xmath125  ( @xmath126 . obviously , this is not a fundamental limit .",
    "the only collision effect restricting  luminosity at photon colliders is the coherent pair production which leads to the conversion of a high energy photon into  pair in the field of the opposing electron beam  @xcite .",
    "the probability of this process is high when @xmath127 [ ] g.    there are three ways to avoid this effect : a ) use flat beams ; b ) deflect the electron beam after conversion at a sufficiently large distance from the ip ; c ) under certain conditions ( low beam energy , long bunches ) the beam field at the ip is below the critical one due to the repulsion of electron beams  @xcite .",
    "the problem of ultimate luminosities for different beam parameters and energies was analyzed recently in ref.@xcite analytically and by simulation .",
    "the resume is following . at `` low '' energies ( @xmath128 , depending on the beam length ) , the coherent pair production is not very important , even for a very small @xmath129 s , it is because electron beams are repulsing each other so that the field on the beam axis ( which affects high energy photons ) is below the critical field .",
    "it means that the @xmath130 luminosity is simply proportional to the geometric electron - electron luminosity @xmath131 .",
    "having electron beams with sufficiently low emittances one can obtain , in principle , @xmath132 above @xmath133 .",
    "one of the main problems here is the generation of electron beams with small emittances in both horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "one of promising techniques is discussed below .",
    "the transverse beam sizes at the interaction point are determined by the emittances , and : @xmath134 , where  is the beta function at the ip . with an increase of the beam energy",
    "the emittance of the bunch decreases : @xmath135 , where @xmath136  is the _",
    "normalized _ emittance .",
    "the beams with a small  are usually prepared in damping rings which naturally produce bunches with @xmath137 .",
    "laser rf photoguns can also produce beams with low emittances .",
    "however , for linear colliders it is desirable to have smaller emittances .",
    "recently a new method of electron beam cooling was proposed  laser cooling  which allows further reduction of the transverse emittances after damping rings or guns by 13 orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the idea of laser cooling of electron beams is very simple . during a collision with optical laser photons ( in the case of strong fields it is more appropriate to consider the interaction of an electron with an electromagnetic wave ) the transverse distribution of electrons ( @xmath138 ) remains almost the same .",
    "also , the angular spread ( @xmath139 ) is almost constant , because electrons loss momenta almost along their trajectories ( photons follow the initial electron trajectory with a small additional spread ) .",
    "so , the emittance @xmath140 remains almost unchanged . at the same time , the electron energy decreases from @xmath12 down to @xmath141 .",
    "this means that the transverse normalized emittances have decreased : @xmath142 .",
    "one can reaccelerate the electrons up to the initial energy and repeat the procedure . then after n stages of cooling @xmath143 ( if  is far from its limit ) .",
    "there are several questions to this method : 1 ) requirements on laser parameters 2 ) an energy spread of the beam after cooling 3 ) a limit on the final normalized emittances ; 4 ) depolarization .",

    "we will see later that in order to have lower limit on emittance and smaller depolarization it is necessary to have a low @xmath105 .",
    "with a conventional optics one can reduce @xmath105 only by increasing @xmath42 ( and @xmath151 ) with a simultaneous increase of the laser flash energy . from ( [ c3 ] ) and ( [ c5 ] ) we get @xmath152 .    in sect.[conv ] we already discussed the way of reducing @xmath105 keeping the flash energy constant , it is stretching of the conversion region without changing the radius of this area .",
    "one of possible solutions  @xcite uses chirped laser pulses ( wave length depends linearly on longitudinal position ) and chromaticity of the focusing system . in this scheme ,",
    "the laser target consists of many laser focal points ( continuously ) and light comes to each point exactly at the moment when the electron bunch is there . the required flash energy is determined only by diffraction and at the optimum wave length it does not depend on the collider energy .",
    "the electron energy spread arises from the quantum - statistical nature of radiation .",
    "after energy loss @xmath153 , the increase of the energy spread @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the spectral density of photons emitted per unit time , @xmath156 for the compton case and @xmath157 for the `` wiggler '' case .",
    "there is the second effect which leads to decreasing the energy spread .",
    "it is due to the fact that @xmath158 and an electron with higher ( lower ) energy than the average loses more ( less ) than on average .",
    "this results in the damping : @xmath159 ( here @xmath160 has negative sign ) . the full equation for the energy spread is @xmath161 , with solution @xmath162 . in our case",
    "@xmath163 here the results for the compton scattering and sr are joined together .",

    "production of positrons for linear  colliders is a challenging problem .",
    "several possible solutions are based on a laser technique :          in the section [ conv ] we have seen that high energy electrons at the conversion region can produced pairs  @xcite .",
    "this is the a two - step process : 1 ) the high energy photon is produced in the compton scattering of a laser photon on high energy electron , 2 )  pair is produced in collisions of high energy photon with a laser photon .",
    "the threshold of this process is @xmath16 .",
    "baier  @xcite has considered this scheme for the production of polarized positrons .",
    "practical use of this scheme is a big question .",
    "it requires electron beams with high energy ( @xmath231 gev for laser with @xmath232 ) , the produced positrons have large energies and _ too large energy spread_.    chen and palmer  @xcite proposed to use the same scheme but with a very strong laser field ( @xmath233 and @xmath234 ) . in this case",
    "the @xmath235 shower is developed which stops when the photon energies of became below the coherent pair production threshold . as a result ,",
    "one can obtain ( one of examples ) @xmath236 with the energy about 1.5 gev and 7% r.m.s energy spread .",
    "it is remarkable that the normalized emittance of the final beam can be much lower than that of the initial electron beam .",
    "unfortunately , final positrons and electrons in this scheme are unpolarized .",
    "this method also requires high energy initial electron beams ( above 50 gev ) .",
    "this scheme was described recently by hirose , omori , tsunemi et al . at lc97 in zvenigorod and it is prepared now for testing at kek . the 6.7 gev electron beam is collided with a focused circularly polarized co@xmath237 laser and produces photons with the maximum energy of 80 mev .",
    "photons in the high energy part of spectrum have the high degree of the circular polarization .",
    "further these photons are brought to the w target where  pairs are produced .",
    "positrons with @xmath238 mev have the average longitudinal polarization about 80 % .",
    "what is essential in this scheme :      \\2 .",
    "the laser target consists of 40 conversion regions ( created by 40 lasers ) with 5 cm spacing .",
    "this is done for two reason : a ) it is a way to create a thick laser target using several low power lasers , b ) in this case , the nonlinear parameter @xmath103 ( an electron is scattered on one laser photon ) .",
    "this is very important to have collisions with only one laser photon .",
    "if the number of absorbed laser photons is fluctuating the maximum energy of scattered photons is fluctuating as well , polarization is no longer an unique function of the photon energy and as a result , the photons at any energy have low degree of polarization .",
    "the total flash energy of 40 co@xmath237 lasers in the kek scheme is about 10 j , each electron produces 5.7 photons with the energy 1 - 80 mev , the yield of polarized positrons per one initial electron is about 0.2 . for the jlc positron injector",
    "the total power consumption from plug is 17 mw for linac and 3.2 mw for the laser system .",
    "numbers are reasonable .",
