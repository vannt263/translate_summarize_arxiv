    "the idea of a common data format for visible - wavelength and infrared astronomical interferometry ( hence referred to collectively as `` optical interferometry '' ) arose through discussions at the june 2000 nsf - sponsored meeting in socorro  @xcite .",
    "since 2001 , t.p . and j.s.y .",
    "have been responsible , under the auspices of the international astronomical union ( iau ) , for coordinating discussion on this topic , and for producing and maintaining the specification document for a format based on the flexible image transport system ( fits )  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for a creating a data format specific to optical interferometry was two - fold .",
    "firstly , existing formats designed for radio interferometry such as uv - fits  @xcite and fits - idi  @xcite do not describe optical data adequately .",
    "secondly , the more popular uv - fits format is poorly defined ",
    "its content has evolved and the format is partly defined by reference to the behaviour of the aips software  and based on the deprecated fits `` random group '' conventions .",
    "the principal shortcoming of the radio interferometry formats is that fourier data is stored as complex visibilities .",
    "the noise models for radio and optical interferometry are quite different ; optical interferometers must usually integrate incoherently to obtain useful signal - to - noise .",
    "thus the `` good '' observables in the optical are calibrated fringe power spectra ( squared visibility amplitudes ) and bispectra ( triple product amplitudes and closure phases ) , rather than complex visibilities . a file format based on complex visibilities",
    "can only encode ( optical ) closure phases if corresponding visibility amplitude and closure phase measurements are made simultaneously , and even then the uncertainties on the closure phases are not stored ( radio interferometry analysis software assumes zero closure phase error ) .",
    "there is also no way of saving bispectrum ( triple product ) amplitudes .",
    "preliminary drafts of the specification for an optical interferometry format were discussed by the community at the 198th meeting of the american astronomical society in june 2001 , and the august 2001 meeting of the iau working group on optical / ir interferometry .",
    "the discussion continued by email amongst various interested parties , and the document was revised .",
    "a public pre - release of the format specification and accompanying example c code was made in march 2002 , followed by a second pre - release of the document in april 2002 .",
    "this draft was discussed at the august 2002 iau working group meeting .",
    "comments were presented by participants from the european southern observatory and the interferometry science center ( now the michelson science center ) . since the iau working group meeting there were two further pre - releases of the format specification , prior to the first `` production '' release .",
    "the standard was frozen on 7 april 2003 ( release 5 of the format specification ) , meaning that subsequent changes would require increments of the revision numbers for the changed tables .",
    "the history of the format specification is summarized in table  [ tab : history ] .    the standard is now supported by the majority of optical interferometer projects , including coast , npoi , iota , chara , vlti , pti , and the keck interferometer .",
    "this paper contains the formal definition of the standard , in sec .",
    "[ sec : start ] onwards . as earlier versions of the format specification have only been distributed via the world - wide - web ,",
    "this paper formalises the standard and serves as a published reference for it",
    ". further discussion explaining the design decisions and providing explicit pointers to existing software for reading and writing the format can be found in @xcite , which is intended as a `` companion '' to the official format specification given here .    a first application of the exchange format , a `` beauty contest '' to compare the performance of a number of image reconstruction software packages , is described by @xcite .",
    "the contest demonstrated that four different international groups could faithfully reconstruct images from simulated datasets in the oifits format .",
    "no alterations have been made to the standard since release 5 of the format specification .",
    "the text in sec .",
    "[ sec : start ] onwards is substantially the same as that in release 5 , apart from minor changes to clarify certain points and to conform to the journal style .",
    "the revision numbers of all tables defined by the standard remain at unity .",
    "by defining and maintaining a common data format , we hope to encourage the development of common software for analysis of data from optical stellar interferometers , and to facilitate the exchange of data between different research groups . in this way",
    ", the limited fourier coverage of current instruments can be ameliorated by combining data from several interferometers .",
    "an example of this is given in the paper by @xcite .",
    "the format is intended to support the storage of calibrated , time - averaged data .",
    "such data can be prepared from the raw fringe measurements without using information about the detailed structure of the target ( i.e.  without doing any astrophysical interpretation ) , yet once the data is in the format , it can be analysed without knowing the details of the instrument .",
    "calibrated data from different interferometers can be treated in the same way ( provided there are no residual systematic errors ) .",
    "the standard includes the information needed to perform `` imaging '' from a calibrated data - set . here",
    "imaging refers loosely to any process for making inferences about the sky brightness distribution from the data .",
    "the standard explicitly allows extra binary tables or columns , beyond those it defines , to be used to store additional information . in this way",
    ", the standard can be used for other purposes besides imaging , e.g.  for astrometry or as an archive format .",
    "we suggest that the common data format be referred to as the `` oi exchange format '' , or the `` exchange format '' when the context is clear .",
    "a suitable very short moniker is `` oifits '' ( or `` oi - fits '' ) .",
    "in what follows we use the fits binary table nomenclature of keywords and column headings .",
    "the values associated with the keywords can be considered as scalars , while each column can be simply an array , or an array of `` pointers '' to other arrays .",
    "the following data types are used in the standard : i = integer ( 16-bit ) , a = character , e = real ( 32-bit ) , d = double ( 64-bit ) , l = logical . in the tables",
    "below , the number in parentheses is the dimensionality of the entry .",
    "the table names given below correspond to the values of the extname keyword .",
    "other mandatory keywords describing the structure of the fits binary tables  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been omitted from this document .",
    "@xcite also describes various extensions to binary tables that are not part of the fits standard .",
    "none of these are currently used in this format .",
    "the definitions of all tables have been `` frozen '' since april 2003 .",
    "all revision numbers are currently equal to one .",
    "any future changes will require increments in the revision numbers of the altered tables .",
    "the conventions described here are generally identical to those used in radio interferometry and described in standard textbooks  ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "the baseline vector between two interferometric stations a and b whose position vectors are @xmath0 and @xmath1 is defined as @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 is the east component and @xmath4 is the north component of the projection of the baseline vector onto the plane normal to the direction of the phase center , which is assumed to be the pointing center .",
    "the basic observable of an interferometer is the complex visibility , which is related to the sky brightness distribution @xmath5 by a fourier transform : @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are displacements ( in radians ) in the plane of the sky ( which is assumed to be flat ) .",
    "the origin of this coordinate system is the phase center .",
    "@xmath7 is in the direction of increasing right ascension ( i.e. the @xmath7 axis points east ) , and @xmath8 is in the direction of increasing declination ( the @xmath8 axis points north ) . with @xmath7 and @xmath8 defined , the above equation defines the sign convention for complex visibilities that should be used in the data format .",
    "the visibility is normalized by the total flux from the target , which is assumed to remain constant over the time spanned by the measurements in the file .",
    "neither the field of view over which the `` total '' flux is collected , or the field of view over which fringes are detected ( i.e. the limits of the above integral ) , can be inferred from the data file .",
    "the squared visibility is simply the modulus squared of the complex visibility : @xmath9      the triple product , strictly the bispectrum , is the product of the complex visibilities on the baselines forming a closed loop joining three stations a , b and c. in the following expression , @xmath10 is the projection of ab and @xmath11 is the projection of bc ( and hence @xmath12 is the projection of ac ) : @xmath13      the data are assumed to be complex triple products averaged over a large number of `` exposures '' . in such a case , the noise can be fully described in terms of a gaussian noise ellipse in the complex plane .",
    "photon , detector and background noise tend to lead to noise ellipses that are close to circular . on the other hand , fluctuating atmospheric phase errors across telescope apertures typically cause fluctuations in the amplitude of the triple product which are much larger than the fluctuations in the phase .",
    "thus the `` atmospheric '' contribution to the noise ellipse is elongated along the direction of the mean triple product vector in the argand diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t3noise ] .",
    "such noise needs to be characterised in terms of the variance @xmath14 perpendicular to the mean triple product vector and the variance @xmath15 parallel to @xmath16 .",
    "we can parameterize the perpendicular variance in terms of a `` phase error '' @xmath17 .",
    "the phase error gives an approximate value for the rms error in the closure phase in degrees .",
    "we denote @xmath18 as the `` amplitude error '' .    in many cases ,",
    "the observer may be interested primarily in the closure phase and not the triple product amplitude , and therefore may choose not to calibrate the amplitude .",
    "such a case can be indicated in the above notation as an infinite amplitude error and a finite phase error .",
    "the data format specifies that such a case should be indicated by a null value for the amplitude ( the amplitude error value is then ignored ) .",
    "there was much discussion on the ( now defunct ) ` oi-data@rsd.nrl.navy.mil ` email list of the representation to use for complex visibilities in the standard .",
    "a number of different classes of data can be represented as complex visibilities , including several varieties of differential phase data . in all cases the standard",
    "should only be used to store averaged data .",
    "thus , as with triple products , we must consider the shape of the noise ellipse in the complex plane .",
    "it has been demonstrated  @xcite that both circularly - symmetric noise , and noise ellipses elongated parallel to or perpendicular to the mean vector can occur in practice .",
    "thus far there has been no evidence for noise ellipses elongated parallel to the real or imaginary axes , although examples of some classes of data have yet to be presented .",
    "hence an amplitude / phase representation of complex visibilities , mirroring that used for triple products , has been adopted in the current version of the standard .",
    "a valid exchange - format fits file must contain one ( and only one ) oi_target table , plus one or more of the data tables : oi_vis , oi_vis2 , or oi_t3 .",
    "each data table must refer to an oi_wavelength table that is present in the file",
    ". there may be more than one of each type of data table ( e.g. oi_vis2 ) . one or more oi_array tables ( or equivalent e.g. for aperture masking , in future releases of the standard ) may optionally be present . where multiple tables of the same extname are present",
    ", each should have a unique value of extver ( this according to the fits standard  however the example c code and j.d.m.s idl software do not require extver to be present ) .    the tables can appear in any order .",
    "other header - data units may appear in the file , provided their extnames do not begin with `` oi _ '' .",
    "reading software should not assume that either the keywords or the columns in a table appear in a particular order .",
    "this is straightforward to implement using software libraries such as cfitsio .",
    "any of the tables may have extra keywords or columns beyond those defined in the standard .",
    "it would facilitate the addition of new keywords and columns in future releases of the standard if the non - standard keywords and column names were given a particular prefix e.g. `` ns _ '' , to avoid conflicts .",
    "as defined , this table is aimed at ground - based interferometry with separated telescopes .",
    "alternative tables could be used for other cases .",
    "these must have at least an arrname keyword , for cross - referencing purposes .",
    "each oi_array - equivalent table in a file must have a unique value for arrname .",
    "each data table must refer ( via the insname keyword ) to a particular oi_wavelength table describing the wavelength channels for the measurements .",
    "each data table may optionally refer , via the arrname keyword , to an oi_array table .",
    "the value in the time column shall be the mean utc time of the measurement in seconds since 0h on date - obs .",
    "note this may take negative values , or values @xmath19 seconds , and hence the epoch of observation for the particular table is not restricted to date - obs .",
    "the value in the mjd column shall be the mean utc time of the measurement expressed as a modified julian day",
    ". it might be appropriate to use the mjd values instead of the time values when dealing with long time - spans , but the standard makes no stipulation in this regard .",
    "the exchange format will normally be used for interchange of time - averaged data .",
    "the `` integration time '' is therefore the length of time over which the data were averaged to yield the given data point .",
    "ucoord , vcoord give the coordinates in meters of the point in the uv plane associated with the vector of visibilities .",
    "the data points may be averages over some region of the uv plane , but the current version of the standard says nothing about the averaging process .",
    "this may change in future versions of the standard",
    ".                it may be useful to allow for some optional tables .",
    "for example , there might be one that contains instrument specific information , such as the backend configuration .",
    "another optional table could contain information relevant to astrometry .",
    "the extnames of additional tables should not begin with `` oi _ '' .",
    "development of the format was performed under the auspices of the iau working group on optical / ir interferometry , and has the strong support of its members .",
    "we would like to thank peter  r. lawson ( chair of the working group ) for his encouragement and support .",
    "the authors would like to thank david buscher , christian hummel , and david mozurkewich for providing material for the format specification and the oifits website .",
    "we would like to take this opportunity to thank all those in the community who have contributed to the definition of the format and to its take - up by many interferometer projects .",
