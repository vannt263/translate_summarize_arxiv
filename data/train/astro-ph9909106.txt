    "two sources of x - ray emission are expected in planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "first , the hot central stars may reach temperatures as high as 100,000  200,000 k and emit in soft x - rays .",
    "second , in a wind - wind interaction model of pne , the fast ( 1,000  3,000 km  s@xmath3 ) stellar wind can be shock - heated to 10@xmath1 k and emit x - rays .",
    "these two types of x - ray emission have different spatial extent and spectral properties .",
    "x - ray emission from a hot central star should be a point source ; its spectral properties ought to reflect the photospheric emission expected from the star .",
    "x - ray emission from the shocked fast stellar wind , on the other hand , should be distributed and extend toward the inner wall of the dense pn shell ; its spectrum ought to be characterized by thin plasma emission , which consists of both lines and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "x - ray emission from a pn , if detected , may provide essential information on pn formation mechanisms .",
    "for example , the spatial distribution and spectral properties of diffuse x - ray emission from a pn tell us the location and physical conditions of hot , shocked gas in the pn interior .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission from a pn interior extending toward the inner shell walls would lend strong support to the wind - wind interaction model . a point source centered on the pn nucleus with a hard x - ray spectrum or an extraordinarily high x - ray luminosity",
    "may indicate a different emission mechanism , such as an x - ray binary .",
    "x - ray observations of planetary nebulae ( pne ) have been carried out by the _ einstein observatory _ ( 1978  1981 ) , the _ exosat _ ( 1983  1986 ) , and the _ rosat _ ( 1990  1998 ) .",
    "the first report of x - ray emission from a pn was made by de korte et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , using _ exosat",
    "_ observations of ngc1360 .",
    "soon after , tarafdar & apparao ( 1988 ) detected x - ray emission from four pne using archival _",
    "einstein _ observations , and apparao & tarafdar ( 1989 ) added another four pne using archival _",
    "observations . as these pne are not adequately resolved by the _ einstein _ and _ exosat _ instruments , their x - ray emission has been interpreted as stellar emission .    the _ rentgen satellite ( rosat ) _ , launched in june 1990 , carried on board three x - ray instruments with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution : two identical position sensitive proportional counters ( pspcs ) and a high resolution imager ( hri ) .",
    "the pspcs have a @xmath22@xmath4 field of view , an on - axis angular resolution of @xmath230@xmath5 , and a spectral resolution of @xmath245% at 1 kev .",
    "the hri has a @xmath238@xmath6 field of view , an on - axis angular resolution of @xmath25@xmath5 , but a negligible spectral resolution .",
    "the pspcs are sensitive in the energy range of 0.1  2.4 kev , and the hri 0.1  2.0 kev .",
    "the soft x - ray response made _ rosat _ ideally suitable for pn observations .",
    "both pointed observations and _ rosat _ all - sky survey data were used to study x - ray emission from pne .",
    "seven new detections , including three diffuse sources , were reported ( kreysing et al .",
    "1992 ; rauch , koeppen , & werner 1994 ; hoare et al .  1995 ; chu & ho 1995 ; leahy , kwok , & yin 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , some of the reports of x - ray emission from pne were plagued by ( 1 ) misidentifications , where extraneous background x - ray sources were identified as pn emission ; ( 2 ) erroneous interpretations of electronic ghost images in pspc observations below 0.2 kev as diffuse x - ray emission ; and ( 3 ) over - interpretation of low s / n data , of which noise peaks were identified as diffuse emission .",
    "some of these errors have been pointed out by chu , kwitter , & kaler ( 1993 ) , hoare et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , conway & chu ( 1997 ) , and chu , gruendl , & conway ( 1998 ) .    as the _ rosat _ mission ended in 1998 , all _ rosat _ observations",
    "have been archived and available at the mpe in germany or the heasarc in the us .",
    "it is now possible to use the entire _ rosat _ archive to make a complete and comprehensive investigation of x - ray emission from pne .",
    "we have searched for _ rosat _ observations that contain a pn within the central 40@xmath6-diameter field of view .",
    "we used the list of galactic pne from the  strasbourg - eso catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae \" ( acker et al .",
    "1992 ) , available from ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/cats/v/84 .",
    "eighty pne have _ rosat _ observations available : 17 have both pspc and hri observations , 55 have only pspc observations , and 8 have only hri observations . for each pn , we extract x - ray images from the _ rosat _ observations , and compare them to the optical image extracted from the digitized sky survey .",
    "a positive detection is claimed only if an x - ray source is centered within a pn boundary and has no other optical counterpart , such as a foreground star or a background agn . for pspc detections ,",
    "we also extract spectra for further analysis .",
    "the details of our archival study of this complete _ rosat _ sample of pne will be reported in a paper by guerrero et al .",
    "the main results are summarized in the next section .",
    "pne emit only weakly in x - rays . of the 13 pne detected by _",
    "rosat _ observations ,",
    "all are within 2 kpc and have absorption column densities of n@xmath7 2@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "their x - ray luminosities range approximately from 10@xmath11 to 10@xmath12 erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "rosat pspc observations of pne have revealed three distinct types of x - ray spectra ( conway & chu 1997 ) .    _ type 1 _ has the softest spectral energy distribution .",
    "the detected photons are all at energies below @xmath20.4 kev , and the counts increase toward lower energies .",
    "pne with type 1 spectra include ngc246 , ngc1360 , ngc3587 , ngc6853 , k1 - 16 , and a30 .",
    "all , except a30 , are unresolved x - ray sources and have stellar @xmath13 k. their x - ray spectra can be fitted by blackbody emission models with temperatures of @xmath14 k. it is most likely that these x - ray sources represent photospheric emission from the central stars .",
    "_ type 2 _ spectra are harder , with most detected photons at energies above 0.5 kev .",
    "pne with type 2 spectra include bd+30@xmath43639 and ngc6543 , whose x - ray spectra can be fitted by thin plasma emission models with plasma temperatures of a few @xmath810@xmath15 k. it is interesting that both nebulae have been reported to host diffuse x - rays .",
    "three additional pne may have type 2 spectra : a36 , k1 - 27 , and ngc7009 ; their pspc spectra are noisy but do not show the tell - tale peak toward the lowest energy bin of the pspc as shown in type 1 or type 3 spectra .",
    "_ type 3 _ spectra are composite , with a strong soft component and a weak hard component .",
    "only ngc7293 and lotr5 belong to this category .",
    "neither is resolved .",
    "the origin of the hard component is difficult to explain .",
    "lotr5 is a known binary , but ngc7293 is not .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission has been reported in three pne : a30 , bd+30@xmath43639 , and ngc6543 .",
    "in all three cases , the x - ray emission is marginally resolved by the instruments , with the source sizes being @xmath161.5 times the instrumental fwhm .",
    "the diffuse emission surrounding the central star of a30 is detected at only a 2@xmath17 level ( chu , chang , & conway 1997 ) .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission of ngc6543 is detected only by pspc , with a @xmath230@xmath5 instrumental resolution , which is larger than the entire `` cat s eye '' of ngc6543 .",
    "x - ray observations with a higher spatial resolution are needed to confirm the diffuse x - ray emission in these nebulae .",
    "the hard x - ray components in type 2 and type 3 spectra are indicative of the presence of hot gas ; pne with such spectra are therefore the best future targets to search for diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    ", one of the four _ great observatories _ , was launched on 1999 july 23 and delivered to its working orbit on august 7 . in the very near future ,",
    "_ chandra _ will be observing with its advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , high resolution camera ( hrc ) , and transmission grating spectrometers at low and high energies ( letg and hetg , respectively ) .    in cycle 1 , four pne will be observed with the spectroscopic array ( acis - s ) , which offers @xmath21@xmath5 angular resolution and an energy resolution of @xmath18 = 10 at 0.5 kev .",
    "the four pne s names , exposure times , and pis are : bd+30@xmath43639 , 20 ks , kastner ; ngc6543 , 50 ks , chu ; ngc7027 , 20 ks , kastner ; and ngc7293 , 50 ks , chu",
    ".    the acis - s observations of these pne will show unambiguously whether the x - ray emission originates from the central stars or the hot , shocked gas in pn interiors .",
    "if diffuse x - ray emission is detected , we may use it to determine the location and temperature of the hot gas . if point sources are detected",
    ", we may perform timing analysis as well as spectral analysis to determine whether x - ray binaries are present .    besides _ chandra _",
    ", two other space observatories may be used to study the hot star and gas in pne : the european _ x - ray multi - mirror mission ( xmm ) _ and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse)_. compared to _ chandra _ , _ xmm _ has a greater sensitivity to soft x - rays but a worse angular resolution . if no diffuse x - ray emission from pne is confirmed by _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm _ , the presence of 10@xmath15  10@xmath19 k gas in pn interiors will be in serious doubt .",
    "it is then important to search for cooler gas at a few times 10@xmath20 k gas .",
    "_ fuse _ provides a means to detect such gas in a pn interior via the nebular ovi absorption lines against the spectrum of the central star , if one can distinguish among the foreground interstellar component , the photoionized component , and the collisionally ionized component of o@xmath21 .",
