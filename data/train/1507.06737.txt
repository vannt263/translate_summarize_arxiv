    "cognitive radio is a subject of intense interest motivated by its potential for better usage of spectral resources . to explore the fundamental limits of such channels , and to make use of powerful techniques developed for capacity of channels with state known at transmitter , some information - theoretic cognitive models allow a cognitive node to possess non - causal knowledge of data originating elsewhere .",
    "interestingly , in the recent years applications have emerged where knowledge of another nodes data prior to transmission is indeed practically viable .",
    "examples include heterogeneous networks or coordinated networks , where some base stations can possess knowledge of the messages of other base stations by coordination .",
    "other examples involve layered cell structures , where macro base stations can know the messages of pico base stations that are routed from the macro base station over backhaul links .",
    "such heterogeneous or coordinated networks can be modeled by interference channels with cognitive transmitters  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the model in @xcite , when a cognitive transmitter does not have its intended receiver , it is called cognitive relay and helps other transmitters in a way of reducing the effective interference at the receivers . in this paper",
    ", we consider the interference channel with a cognitive relay ( iccr ) where transmitter - receiver pairs constitute an interference channel and the cognitive relay helps the transmitters .",
    "previous works in this area have generally focused on perfect and instantaneous channel state information at transmitter ( csit ) .",
    "however , feedback delays are often present in real systems and make feedback information outdated .",
    "fortunately , the usefulness of delayed csit has been explored in various channel models @xcite .",
    "the iccr with delayed feedback , nevertheless , has not received much attention despite its importance .",
    "the iccr was first considered in  @xcite where an achievable rate region via a combination of dirty paper coding @xcite and beamforming was reported . in @xcite , a new achievable region",
    "was presented by a combination of the han - kobayashi coding scheme @xcite and dirty paper coding , and an outer bound for the gaussian iccr was derived . for a discrete memoryless ( dm )",
    "iccr , an outer bound was first derived in @xcite and then improved achievable rate regions and outer bounds were reported in  @xcite .",
    "the capacity region of dm - iccr is known in very strong and strong interference regime @xcite , but it still remains unknown under general channel conditions .",
    "when capacity remains intractable , the degrees of freedom ( dof ) are often used to understand the asymptotic characteristics of the capacity .",
    "the dof is defined as the ratio of the capacity of the channel of interest to a simple siso gaussian channel capacity , when transmit power goes infinity .",
    "the dof of iccr has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was proved in  @xcite that the two - user gaussian iccr has dof @xmath2 almost surely if perfect and instantaneous csit and csi at receiver ( csir ) are available , which implies that each receiver does not suffer from interference in an asymptotic sense . for the @xmath3 users with perfect csit and csir , achievable sum dof and outer bounds of the sum dof",
    "were derived in  @xcite .",
    "although a conventional relay can not increase the dof  @xcite , the authors of  @xcite showed that a cognitive relay can improve dof unlike a conventional relay ; the optimal sum dof for @xmath3 users with perfect csit is @xmath4 if @xmath3 is odd while the sum dof for the @xmath3-user interference channel with perfect csit is @xmath5 by interference alignment  @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of delayed csit has been first demonstrated in @xcite for multiple - input single - output broadcast channel ( bc ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the base station exploits the delayed csi to estimate the interference at each receiver in the previous transmission ( i.e. , the side information at the receivers ) and then retrospectively align the interfering signals with the help of the side information . for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) bc with delayed csit ,",
    "an outer bound of the dof region with @xmath3 users and the dof region with two users were derived in  @xcite , and sum dof for a three - user case was obtained in  @xcite .",
    "new retrospective interference alignment schemes for an interference channel and an @xmath6 channel with delayed csit and delayed output feedback were proposed in  @xcite , and the sum dof was derived .",
    "the achievable dof reported in  @xcite was improved in  @xcite .",
    "recently ,  @xcite proved the usefulness of ergodic interference alignment in a @xmath3-user interference channel when only delayed feedback is available and showed that the sum dof of 2 can be achievable as @xmath3 goes to infinity , which is the best dof result until now in a @xmath3-user interference channel with delayed csit .",
    "derived in  @xcite . in  @xcite , the dof region with delayed csit was derived for general mimo interference channel with an arbitrary numbers of antennas .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed that shannon feedback , which has both output feedback and delayed csit , strictly enlarges the dof region of the mimo interference channel compared to the case with delayed csit only @xcite . for delayed local csit , an achievable dof region of mimo interference channel",
    "was derived in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors presented a hybrid csit model where one transmitter has perfect and instantaneous knowledge of channel matrices corresponding to one user while the other transmitter has only delayed csi corresponding to the other user , and derived the dof region of the mimo interference channel with hybrid csit .",
    "moreover , the dof regions of mimo interference channel and broadcast channel without csit were derived in  @xcite , and in addition to mimo interference channel and broadcast channel , the dof region of a cognitive radio channel without csit was reported in  @xcite .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the interference channel with cognitive relay in the presence of various types of delayed feedback at the transmitter in independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) fading channels . in all cases",
    "perfect csir is assumed . unless explicitly mentioned otherwise ,",
    "a two - user system is considered .",
    "the types of delayed feedback information ( including no feedback ) are    * delayed csit : transmitters and a cognitive relay know all channels after one sample delay . * delayed output feedback : transmitters and a cognitive relay know output of their intended receiver after one sample delay .",
    "* delayed shannon feedback : transmitters and a cognitive relay know all channel gains and the output of intended receiver after one sample delay . * no feedback : both transmitters and a cognitive relay do not have any channel information .",
    "for each type of delayed feedback , an outer bound for the dof region is derived .",
    "focusing on the special case of the single - input single - output ( siso ) , a scheme is proposed that achieves the outer bound based on the retrospective interference alignment for each type of feedback . from the derived dof region , it is shown that the sum dof in the single - antenna network is @xmath7 for delayed csit , delayed output feedback , and delayed shannon feedback with the help of a cognitive relay , compared with the sum - dof of the interference channel which is only 1 regardless of availability of csit .",
    "it is also shown that a cognitive relay does not extend the dof region in the absence of csit .",
    "the proposed retrospective interference alignment scheme is extended to the mimo case .",
    "it is shown that for the three types of delayed feedback information , the dof regions achieved by the proposed retrospective interference alignment scheme are similar , matching the dof outer bound for all antenna configurations . comparing with the dof region",
    "when delayed feedback information is not available at both the transmitters and the cognitive relay , the delayed feedback information is useful for expanding the dof region when @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the numbers of antennas at the transmitter , the relay , and the receiver , respectively . if delayed feedback is not available at the cognitive relay , the optimal dof region is shown to be achievable except when @xmath12 by the proposed retrospective interference alignment scheme .",
    "our results quantitatively reveal the dof gain from the cognitive relay according to antenna configurations when only delayed feedback information is available .",
    "finally , we compare the sum dof of iccr with those of broadcast channel and interference channel when only delayed csit is available . with the help of the cognitive relay",
    ", iccr has an enlarged dof region compared to mimo interference channel .",
    "furthermore , as a corollary of the above - mentioned results , lower and upper bounds are derived for the sum dof of a cognitive interference channel which is also known as a interference channel with a cognitive transmitter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ model ] describes the system model with various types of delayed feedback information . in section  [ siso ] , focusing on the siso model as a special case , we propose a modified retrospective interference alignment scheme achieving the outer bound for siso model under various types of delayed feedback information .",

    "<S> this paper studies the interference channel with a cognitive relay ( iccr ) under delayed feedback . </S>",
    "<S> three types of delayed feedback are studied : delayed channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) , delayed output feedback , and delayed shannon feedback . </S>",
    "<S> outer bounds are derived for the dof region of the two - user multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) iccr with delayed feedback as well as without feedback . for the single - input single - output ( siso ) scenario , </S>",
    "<S> optimal schemes are proposed based on retrospective interference alignment . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that while a cognitive relay _ without _ feedback can not extend the sum - dof beyond @xmath0 in the two - user siso interference channel , delayed feedback in the same scenario can extend the sum - dof to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> for the mimo case , achievable schemes are obtained via extensions of retrospective interference alignment , leading to dof regions that meet the respective upper bounds . </S>"
