    "in recent times entanglement has come to be recognised as one of the major distinguishing features between quantum systems and classical systems , where it is now seen as being as fundamental as the uncertainty principle .",
    "this point of view has arisen due to the realisation that entanglement is a resource to be exploited in the processing of quantum information @xcite through processes such as teleportation @xcite , dense - coding @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "it has also opened new perspectives in other areas such as condensed matter physics , due the to emerging understanding of the relationship between entanglement and quantum critical phenomena @xcite . as a consequence",
    "there has been an intense level of activity in characterising entanglement and studying its properties .    at the level of bi - partite systems entanglement",
    "is well understood and can be quantified @xcite . from studies of three - qubit systems",
    "it was realised @xcite that different categories of entanglement exist in multi - qubit systems , with the specific example of three - way entanglement shown to be essentially different from bi - partite entanglement through the examples of the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and w states .",
    "now , a clear picture of three - qubit entanglement has emerged with the demonstration of three different types of entanglement existing in the three - qubit case , which are characterised by five generically independent invariants @xcite . though the above results for three - qubit systems can in principle be generalised to arbitrary multi - qubit systems , it is technically challenging to undertake . despite many studies of specific types of multi - qubit entanglement ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", a complete description remains elusive .",
    "our aim in this work is to investigate entanglement in multi - qubit systems through a study of one of its applications , viz .",
    "the protocol for the procedure is as follows , with a schematic representation shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "an unknown qubit state is held by a client ( alice ) , and is to be teleported to a recipient ( bob ) .",
    "alice and bob share a quantum channel which is some state of @xmath0 qubits , so the entire system consists of @xmath3 qubits .",
    "the channel is distributed in such a way that alice may access @xmath4 qubits of the channel while bob has access to a single qubit of the channel .",
    "alice is to perform @xmath1 bell state measurements on the @xmath0-qubit subsystem which is comprised of her unknown state and @xmath4 qubits of the channel .",
    "the consequence of this measurement is that bob is left with a single qubit which is not entangled with the remainder of the system . from the results of the measurements alice",
    "is to send classical information to bob . upon receiving this information , and some knowledge of the channel",
    ", bob determines a local unitary operation called a _ correction gate _ which he applies to his qubit .",
    "any channel for which this procedure exactly reproduces the client state for bob ( i.e. the teleportation is effected with perfect fidelity ) we will call a _",
    "perfect channel_. one of the aims of this work is to determine the complete set of perfect channels for this protocol .",
    "we mention that this protocol is not _",
    "tight _ in the sense of @xcite , and consequently does not belong to the classification of teleportation schemes given therein . on the other hand it does bear similarity to the _ quantum repeater _ described in @xcite , with the major difference being that we employ bell measurements whereas local measurements are used in @xcite .",
    ", a bell measurement is made on the subsystem comprised of the client qubit and the first qubit of the channel .",
    "after measurement , the third qubit is left in the state @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a unitary operator dependent on the measurement outcome .",
    "( b ) in the case of a 4-qubit channel , two bell measurements leave the final qubit in the state @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is determined by both measurement outcomes . in general for a @xmath0-qubit channel , a sequence of @xmath1 bell measurements needs to be made to implement the protocol.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +   + , a bell measurement is made on the subsystem comprised of the client qubit and the first qubit of the channel .",

    "( b ) in the case of a 4-qubit channel , two bell measurements leave the final qubit in the state @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is determined by both measurement outcomes . in general for a @xmath0-qubit channel , a sequence of @xmath1 bell measurements needs to be made to implement the protocol.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    it is well known that teleportation can be performed with perfect fidelity across a 2-qubit channel when the channel is one of the four bell states @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by making a bell state measurement and then sending two bits of information to the recipient via a classical channel , which is then used to determine the correction gate .",
    "it is thus clear that teleportation can also be achieved with perfect fidelity using a channel which is a product of @xmath1 bell states , by performing @xmath1 successive bell state measurements .",
    "however this is not the most general solution to the problem we have described above , and our analysis below shows some surprising results .",
    "the first is that there exist four orthogonal perfect channel subspaces , the direct sum of which is the entire hilbert space of channels .",
    "also , despite the fact that @xmath1 bell measurements need to be performed by alice to implement the teleportation , only two bits of classical information need to be sent from alice to bob for him to determine the correction gate .    because perfect channels fall into one of only four subspaces of the channel state space , an interesting question to consider",
    "is whether the ground states of common many - body systems fall into these classes .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "for example , our results indicate that all spin singlet states are perfect channels , and so the ground state of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , for a number of different lattices , is a perfect channel , as is the ground state of the one - dimensional majumdar ",
    "ghosh model @xcite .",
    "it is also true that the ground state of the model of affleck , kennedy , lieb and tasaki ( aklt ) @xcite is a perfect channel , under an equivalent protocol @xcite . in identifying the perfect channel states we determine a teleportation - order parameter which provides a measure of the effectiveness of an arbitrary channel .",
    "the teleportation - order parameter has close connection with string - order @xcite , as discussed in @xcite in relation to the aklt model , and is also an example of the string operators discussed in @xcite .",
    "we mention however that the results of our analysis are independent of the dimension and topology of the lattice on which the qubits are arranged .",
    "we will also show that this analysis extends to formulate a teleportation protocol for the case of 3-qubit channels , and that there is a generalisation for qudits .",
    "finally , we will discuss some implications of these results towards understanding entanglement in multi - qubit systems .",
    "the results presented here describe in detail the mathematical aspects which underly the results reported in @xcite .",
    "in this section we recall teleportation across a channel of two qubits which exists in one of the four bell states @xcite . while this phenomenon is now well known , the notational conventions we adopt , which are convenient for the following sections , are not standard .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the standard basis for a qubit space @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is an eigenvector of the pauli matrix @xmath10 with eigenvalue @xmath11 . throughout",

    "it is known that each of the bell basis states are related by a _ local _ unitary transformation , which we express as |j : k}=(i x^jk_pq ) |p : q } where & & x^jk_jk = u^0 + & & x^+-_++= x^++_+- = x^-+_=x^_-+ = u^1 + & & x^-+_++= x^++_-+= -x^+-_=-x^_+-= u^2 + & & x^_++= x^+-_-+= -x^++_=-x^-+_+-= u^3 , [ x = u ] and the unitary operators @xmath16 are given by u^0&= &    1 & 0 0 & 1     + u^1&= &    0 & 1 1 & 0     + u^2&= &    1 & 0 0 & -1     + u^3&= &    0 & -1 1 & 0    ( note that the @xmath17 could just as easily have been defined in terms of pauli matrices .",
