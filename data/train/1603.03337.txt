    "irreducibility is a property often ascribed to complex entities : their behaviour can not be compressed into compact descriptions . symmetries  a paramount concept in physics  and recurrent patterns are prominent facilitators , enabling implicit definitions of the systems .",
    "the amount of implicitness allowed is a measure of information content @xcite , as illustrated by kolmogorov s definition of complexity .",
    "the concept of complexity pervades contemporary science , from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems and complex networks to economical and technological studies , prominently in the emerging field of complex systems , where it can promote the discovery of regularities and large - scale trends @xcite .",
    "a recurrent question , notably in evolutionary biology , is whether complexity contributes to fitness @xcite .",
    "its deep interplay with system - level properties such as tolerance and modularity has been investigated both in technological and biological designs @xcite ; robustness of complex systems against fluctuations and attacks , in particular , is the subject of numerous studies @xcite .    although complexity has been examined in detail in single contexts , by employing specific definitions , a study across disciplines is still lacking , and the general consequences and relations with other traits are still largely unknown . in this work",
    "we employ a definition of complexity based on boolean logic @xcite , that is generic enough to be applicable in diverse fields .",
    "logic functions are a natural and simple representation of how information flows in complex systems @xcite .",
    "they are used to express genotype to phenotype mappings  both in metabolic @xcite and electronic @xcite systems  , rules for the control of gene expression @xcite , relations in protein networks @xcite , cryptographic cyphers @xcite , functions realised by digital electronic circuits @xcite , simple cooperative games @xcite , and they lie at the foundations of mathematical logic @xcite . complexity in a boolean setting has been addressed especially regarding the global dynamics of boolean networks @xcite , yet it proves profitable already to focus on single functions ( nodes ) @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the properties of individual functions in this paper .",
    "there are @xmath0 distinct boolean functions with @xmath1 variables : finding useful coordinates in this high - dimensional space is a necessity in all fields concerned with logic functions .",
    "a large number of quantities describing various characteristics have been defined and analysed .",
    "some are especially useful for assessing their cryptographic properties ( such as _ correlation immunity _",
    "@xcite ) , some are suited for biological systems ( such as the _ canalising _ quality @xcite ) , some are designed to address issues in specific domains ( such as the _ nakamura number _ in cooperative game theory @xcite ) . here we concentrate on two natural and general `` observables '' , bias and complexity , whose versatility enables their use as a reference frame for comparing different systems in different fields .    we define the notion of _ logic complexity _ of a boolean function as the size of the most compact boolean expression that realises it @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ section : definitions ] for the choice of the description language ) .",
    "firstly ( in sec",
    ".  [ section : results ] ) , we show that this definition assigns quantitatively different complexities to popular classes of logic functions .",
    "we clarify its relation with bias  a measure of the asymmetry between `` on '' and `` off '' values  and with resilience of the functions in noisy environments , thus establishing a quantitative relation between complexity and robustness .",
    "importantly , logic complexity realises a rigorous and general measure for the notion of _ canalisation _ , a fruitful concept developed in the context of gene regulation @xcite . in this field",
    ", our results further expose the inconveniences of the commonly used threshold functions , which turn out to have exceptionally high complexity .",
    "secondly ( in sec",
    ".  [ section : application ] ) , as an illustrative application of the concepts developed , we compute the complexity and the bias in three exemplary systems belonging to the realms of biology , technology , and mathematics , namely genetic regulation , electronic circuits , and propositional calculus . we find that the three systems are characterised by different ranges of the bias , and that the logic complexities are generally small , compared to a null model of random boolean functions .",
    "the non - null trends are elucidated by a model of random boolean networks , suggesting hierarchical organisation as a shared architecture .    altogether , the results presented here advocate the use of bias and complexity as coordinates in a `` morphospace '' for the classification of logic functions , and in particular as a powerful tool for comparing boolean models and data .",
    "more in general , our results remark that complexity is a measurable and empirically relevant trait , indicating similar features in dissimilar systems ; however , its role is entangled with other important properties , such as bias , robustness , and information dispatching , and can not be contemplated in isolation .",
    "a _ boolean _ ( or _ logic _ ) function maps the set @xmath2 to @xmath3 , associating a truth value to each combination of its @xmath1 boolean inputs ( by convention the integers 1 and 0 mean _ true _ and _ false _ , or _ on _ and _ off _ , respectively ) .",
    "the binary nature of this description is sometimes just an approximation to a continuous or multi - valued empirical situation ( such as the expression levels of a gene ) , but has the advantage of being simple to deal with .",
    "since the domain is finite , a function can be specified by exhaustively listing the values it takes for all input combinations .",

    ", there is a way of writing boolean functions which makes them more intelligible to humans , as opposed to computers .",
    "in fact , one can assign names to the function s inputs  the _ literals _  and decompose the function into binary sub - functions ( i.e. , functions of two literals ) and negations ( which are unary functions ) , thus writing it in the form of a _ boolean expression _ ; fig .",
    "[ figure : boolean ] presents an example .",
    "such an expression contains the literals ( possibly repeated ) , parentheses , and binary and unary operators .",
    "all boolean functions can be expressed in this way , as every boolean function can be written as the composition of binary and unary functions .",
    "we will use the set of logical operators @xmath31 ( i.e. , and , or , and not ) to express them . as an example , consider the function of @xmath32 literals @xmath33 , and @xmath34 that is true if one or two literals are true , and false otherwise . with our choice of basic operators",
    "it can be written as @xmath35 .",
    "the definition of complexity that we shall employ for boolean functions uses _ disjunctive normal forms _ ( dnf ) as the description language .",
    "a formula is in dnf if it is of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are literals or their negations .",
    "for example , @xmath38 is in disjunctive normal form , while @xmath39 is not .",

    "can be built by listing explicitly all these combinations , thus obtaining the formula @xmath41 ; however , a more concise formula would be , for instance , @xmath42 .",
    "such a level of conciseness is intuitively related to the lack of complexity of the tautology . in general",
    "one expects that the more complex a function is , the less compact it can be made .",
    "we shall then define the complexity @xmath43 of a function as the number of terms in the _ shortest _ dnf specifying the function ( normalised by @xmath44 ) .",
    "this definition assigns minimum complexity to tautologies and their negations . at the other end of the spectrum , the _ parity function _ , which counts the number of true literals modulo 2 , is _ balanced _  meaning that @xmath45  and has the largest possible complexity , namely @xmath46 .",

    "( c , d ) complexity as a function of bias for the three classes of functions considered , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 literals . ]",
    "measuring the bias of a function @xmath54 is straightforward , as it amounts to counting the number of ones in the truth table . calculating the complexity , instead , is in general a computationally hard problem .",
    "the presence of symmetries in the truth table is what enables the compression . by symmetry , in this context , we mean a choice of a particular combination of values for a fixed subset of literals , such that the value of @xmath54 , conditioned to this choice , does not depend on the other literals",
    "this is the definition of a _ cell _ ( see the appendix ) . finding the most compact normal form representing a function ( or _ minimising _",
    "it ) thus amounts to finding the smallest number of cells sufficient to describe the function s truth values ; this means exploiting the set of its symmetries in the best possible way .",
    "however , even if one has listed all the cells of a function , there could be non - trivial overlaps between them  causing what is known as _ frustration _ in statistical mechanics  thus complicating the task of finding the smallest subset that recovers the function .",
    "in fact , this problem is equivalent to the `` set cover problem '' , a well - known np - hard problem in algorithmic complexity theory @xcite .",
    "fortunately , since the minimisation of logic function is a crucial step in the design of digital circuits , standard algorithms are available for this task . here",
    "we use an implementation of the quine - mccluskey method @xcite , which deterministically finds the minimal form of a function .",
    "the maximum number of literals in the analyses presented here is @xmath55 . for much larger functions ,",
    "an approximate method is needed ( such as `` espresso '' @xcite ) .",
    "such methods have the advantage of being adapted to multi - valued logic , and they even allow for indeterminacies , so they can be used for computing logic complexity in more general settings .",
    "we remark that ideas related to the one advanced here were proposed in the fields of unconventional computation and cellular automata @xcite , where a notion of `` conceptual representation '' for boolean rules was developed .",
    "that method , which makes use of a representation in terms of cells , essentially corresponds to the first step in the quine - mccluskey algorithm , before the set - covering problem is solved .",
    "we show here that the boolean complexity takes values lying in different ranges for different commonly used classes of boolean functions @xcite .",
    "we examine _ random _ functions , i.e.  boolean functions with a fixed number of literals drawn with uniform probability , _ canalising _ functions , for which the value of a single input variable decides whether the other variables have any influence on the result , and _ threshold _ functions , for which the result is decided by the sum of `` enhancer '' variables minus the sum of `` inhibitor '' variables .",
    "more formally , the ensemble of random functions with @xmath1 literals is defined as the set of all @xmath1-variables boolean functions , endowed with the flat probability measure .",
    "this ensemble is useful as a null ( unconstrained ) model for discerning positive features in other classes of functions , as well as in the data .",
    "random canalising functions are defined as follows .",
    "consider a function @xmath56 of @xmath1 literals @xmath57",
    ". if @xmath54 is canalising , then by definition there exists a literal ( by rearranging the literals , we can assume it is @xmath58 ) and two truth values ( the input @xmath59 and the output @xmath60 ) such that @xmath61 . if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a function of @xmath65 variables .",
    "the random canalising ensemble is specified by taking both @xmath59 and @xmath60 to be 0 or 1 independently with the same probability , and @xmath64 to be a random ( uniform ) function of @xmath65 literals .",
    "threshold functions are often used to model regulatory rules starting from known molecular interactions ( e.g. , in the cell cycle of yeast @xcite ) .",

    "in particular , @xmath69 if @xmath67 is an enhancer and @xmath70 if it is an inhibitor for @xmath68 ( interaction strength can be taken into account by extending the possible values of @xmath66 ) . if @xmath71 are on / off values specifying the presence ( @xmath72 ) or absence ( @xmath73 ) of each protein , then the boolean state @xmath54 of @xmath68 , is computed as @xmath72 or @xmath73 depending on the sign of @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the threshold ) with the exception that if the value is zero then @xmath76 . the ensemble of random threshold functions of @xmath1 variables",

    "threshold , canalizing , and random functions segregate into separate regions , already for @xmath80 .",
    "interestingly , the combination @xmath81 appears to be approximately increasing , decreasing , and constant in @xmath1 for the three classes respectively ( fig  [ figure : classes]b ) .",
    "let us restrict the analysis to fixed numbers of literals @xmath1 , in order to explore the relations between bias and complexity .",
    "panels c and d in fig .",
    "[ figure : classes ] show how the three classes occupy different regions in the b - c space .",
    "these plots have been obtained by generating random functions of each class for each possible value of @xmath28 fixed .",
    "while all types of functions have comparable complexities for extreme biases ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) , in the balanced regime they are sharply discriminated by complexity .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the trends observed above might be due solely to how the typical biases @xmath28 depend on @xmath1 in the three classes of functions .",
    "notice that both the bias and the complexity of threshold functions are quantised , because of symmetry under permutations of the variables . perhaps surprisingly , their complexity is larger than the typical value . changing the threshold value",
    "@xmath75 has the only effect of changing the ensemble weights of the functions ( larger @xmath75 favours functions with lower bias ) , but the b - c plot remains the same .",
    "the figure also exposes a non - monotonic correlation between complexity and bias , common to random and threshold functions . canalising functions ,",
    "whose definition modularly uses a random function of @xmath65 variables , present a similar behaviour on a halved scale ; we are going to study this pattern more in detail .",

    "the number of input variables is @xmath53 . ]",
    "the definition of canalisation employed above isolates exactly one canalising variable @xmath58 .",
    "however , a more general definition can be given , where the number of such special variables is @xmath86 .",
    "if the value of the first canalising variable does not fix the output , then the second canalising variable is considered , and so on in a nested fashion , until the @xmath84-th variable .",
    "more precisely , given a set of input values @xmath87 and a set of output values @xmath88 , @xmath56 takes the value @xmath89 if @xmath90 for all @xmath91 and @xmath92 ; otherwise it is a function @xmath93 of the remaining @xmath94 variables .",
    "the ensemble is specified by taking the @xmath95 s and @xmath96 s as random independent bernoulli variables in @xmath3 and @xmath64 as a random function of @xmath94 literals .",
    "these functions will be called _ random nested canalising _ , and @xmath84 their _ level _ ( our definition is based on that of nested canalisation given in @xcite , but it uses a less constrained measure ) .",
    "we generated 1000 random nested canalising functions of level @xmath97 for each possible value of their bias , and computed their complexity .",
    "the results ( with @xmath53 ) are in fig .",
    "[ figure : canalizing ] ( not all levels are shown for clarity ; other values of @xmath1 yield similar results ) . disregarding for the moment the fine structure that appears as a function of bias ,",
    "the overall trend is clear : the more levels of canalisation a function has , the smaller is its complexity .",
    "canalisation itself can not be measured quantitatively : the level @xmath84 is a rough measure , but it takes only @xmath65 different values .",
    "therefore , complexity , which can take @xmath44 different values , appears as a much more detailed measure of canalisation .",
    "the fractal nature of the plot is interesting . at level @xmath84 , the inverted - u pattern displayed by random functions is repeated @xmath85 times ( this is true independently of @xmath1 ) . fully canalising functions ,",
    "i.e.  those at level @xmath65 , satisfy a deterministic relation between bias and complexity , which can be seen to be given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the sum of all the digits in the base-@xmath100 representation of the integer @xmath101 ( in the case @xmath102 it is known as the binary weight ) .",
    "complexity of a boolean function ( @xmath103 axis ) strongly constrains its robustness ( @xmath104 axis ) , while bias and number of variables have a weak influence .",
    "points in panel a show the robustness versus the complexity of 1000 random boolean functions with @xmath53 literals , generated uniformly on the full range of biases ; the inset shows robustness versus bias for the same data .",
    "panel b collects data for different numbers of literals , showing the average ( lines ) and the @xmath48 variability interval ( shaded areas ) of the robustness as functions of the complexity . ]",
    "noise is an important element of both living and artificial systems .",
    "robustness against errors and fluctuations , for instance in protein folding or signal transduction , is a central question in biology @xcite . in the field of regulatory networks",
    ", noise can be implemented by means of a stochastic generalisation , called _ probabilistic _",
    "boolean networks @xcite , where the functions computed by nodes are subject to a certain degree of variability .",
    "one can then ask what noise level the system can sustain without disrupting its functions .",
    "such questions are relevant in technological systems as well .",
    "it is then interesting to discover that boolean complexity is closely related to fault tolerance in our simple setting .",
    "we employ the definition of robustness @xmath105 detailed in the appendix , which counts the fraction of single - variable flips that have no effect on the output .",
    "more precisely , it is equal to the probability that @xmath106 , when the values of @xmath57 are chosen randomly and @xmath67 is a random integer between 1 and @xmath1 .",
    "as discussed above , simple functions are intuitively recognised as those having a large number of symmetries , where a symmetry ( as outlined by the technical notion of _ cell _ described in the appendix ) is a group of input combinations such that the function s value is not sensitive to changes of some of the variables .",
    "thus , one expects simpler functions to be more robust .",
    "in fact , computing the robustness for functions with varying biases and complexities shows that @xmath105 is strongly dependent on @xmath43 ( and very slightly on @xmath28 ) .",
    "figure [ figure : robustness ] displays these correlations , and shows that the dependence of @xmath105 on the number of variables @xmath1 is almost undetectable .",
    "statistically significant correlations remain also if one conditions the analysis to fixed values of the bias , thus confirming the relation . also , flipping @xmath107 variables instead of @xmath72 , thus increasing the noise level in the definition of @xmath105 , has negligible effects on the results .",
    "we are going to apply the concepts developed in the previous sections to empirical systems of different types , belonging to the broad areas of biology , technology and mathematics .",
    "in particular , we will focus on transcription regulation in eukaryotes , digital electronic circuitry in a general - purpose processor , and theorems in propositional logic .",
    "the three data sets employed here are chosen as a reference , and do not intend to be general representatives of their respective fields .",

    "several proteins , including _ transcription factors _ that bind to the dna , can participate in the regulation of a single gene .",
    "they can play the simple roles of activators and repressors of transcription , but their complex interactions within chromatin can generate complicated dependencies between their presence / absence patterns and the expression level of a given gene .",
    "these relationships can then be summarised by boolean functions expressing whether each gene is transcribed or not , depending on the presence of each protein that has an influence on the gene .",

    "our goal is to show that analysis of empirical data by means of the bias - complexity coordinates can be helpful in discerning non - null features in the data and devising positive models .",
    "let us start with @xmath1 input nodes , which represent the literals ( refer to fig .",
    "[ figure : morphospace]e ) .",
    "we build a graph iteratively by adding nodes one by one .",
    "each new node carries a random binary function @xmath126 ( either or or and ) , and attaches itself to two randomly chosen nodes , among those already present ( literals included ) . if the values of these nodes are @xmath127 and @xmath100 , than the value of the new node will be @xmath128 .",
    "the growth process is stopped as soon as the first node depending on all @xmath1 input literals appears .",
    "more precisely , the function @xmath54 embodied by the network is defined as the first node whose _ light cone _ contains all input nodes , the light cone of a node @xmath129 being defined as the set of all nodes @xmath28 such that there is a directed path in the network going from @xmath129 to @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ figure : morphospace ] shows that the bias - complexity relation predicted by this model is in reasonable accord with the trend observed in the empirical systems .",
    "the most notable feature is the roughly linear correlation between the two coordinates , which is instead non - monotonic for random functions .",
    "notice that we have chosen @xmath126 to be either or or and with equal probability .",
    "this choice generates functions with biases covering the whole interval @xmath130 ; a statistical prevalence of or reduces the average @xmath28 , while the opposite happens for and , without modifying the trend observed .",
    "adding a negation ( not ) in front of randomly - chosen variables does not change the results appreciably .",
    "the view presented here is based on the observation that logic functions are a widespread tool in modelling complex systems , realising compact two - state descriptions of complicated response functions . therefore , a definition of complexity in a boolean setting is useful , as it enables the quantitative comparison of behaviours across systems .",
    "it proves fruitful also within fields , as a concise indicator summarising several `` microscopic '' features in a single global observable .",
    "as we showed , complexity effectively discriminates different classes of functions widely used in modelling approaches . specifically within the class of canalising functions",
    ", it produces a quantitative measure of `` how much '' canalisation is realised .",
    "this measure is more general and more detailed than the number of canalising variables ; it can be measured exactly for all boolean functions and is arguably more suited to information - theoretic analyses . a long - standing question in the field of genetic regulation concerns the properties of regulatory networks responsible for their not being chaotic @xcite .",
    "it is well known that boolean networks can display chaotic dynamics in certain regimes , at variance with the ordered state their are found to be in living systems .",
    "canalisation is one quality of regulatory rules that has been found to promote network stability",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate how the order - chaos transition in the kauffman model ( a random network of random boolean functions @xcite ) depends on the complexity of the rules ; the results regarding robustness described above are relevant in this sense ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another consequence of our results on the classes of functions commonly used for gene regulation is that threshold functions impose a systematic tendency towards high complexity , and constrain both bias and complexity to very specific values .",
    "the relations uncovered between complexity , on / off asymmetry , and robustness seem to indicate the presence of architectural similarities between the empirical systems considered .",
    "in particular , the low boolean complexity observed in our three data sets and the monotonic correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath28 suggest the existence of a positive mechanism underlying these empirical systems .",
    "a possible rationalisation is given by the simplified model of random logic networks described above , which reproduces the trends .",
    "the information provided is twofold .",
    "first , our example of an empirical application shows that measuring complexity , especially combined with bias in the b - c parametrisation , can promote the discovery of hidden regularities , trends , and tradeoffs .",
    "second , it suggests a possible underlying mechanism recapitulating the statistical regularities measured , namely a modular structure where the whole function to be realised by the system is expressed by means of smaller functions ( i.e. , with fewer inputs than @xmath1 ) organised in a hierarchical arrangement . such a common architecture need not be generated by common evolutionary processes in the three systems .",
    "it may be the consequence of selection  for instance favouring robustness  , or a neutral effect of the system s organisation , or it could expose our preference for simple structures , at least in artificial systems . remarkably , boolean complexity of concepts has been found to be a predictor of subjective difficulty in human learning @xcite .",
    "( in the case of regulation , the difficulty in performing the experiments and completely identifying the set of regulating proteins may be partially responsible for the low complexities observed . )",
    "finally , we remark that the results presented are not sensitive on the particular description language one employs in the definition of logic complexity .",
    "disjunctive _ normal forms ( i.e. , disjunctions of conjunctive clauses ) throughout the paper , but we checked that definitions based on _ conjunctive _ normal forms ( conjunctions of disjunctive clauses ) or _ algebraic _ normal forms ( exclusive disjunctions of conjunctive clauses ) do not change our result statements .",
    "we are thankful to marco cosentino lagomarsino for discussions and useful comments on a previous version of the manuscript .",
    "we also acknowledge discussions with bruno bassetti and jacopo grilli .",
    "a _ boolean function _ @xmath54 of @xmath1 variables is a map @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the configuration of the input variables ( or _ literals _ ) @xmath133 .",
    "a logic function @xmath134 is uniquely determined by its _ truth table _ , which is the explicit listing of the value of @xmath54 for all @xmath44 possible combinations of the @xmath1 variables @xmath133 .",
    "notable functions are the _ tautology _ , which takes the value 1 for all @xmath135 ( a tautology is `` always true '' ) , and the _ parity function _",
    "@xmath136 , which takes the value 1 when the number of literals equal to 1 is odd ( and 0 otherwise ) .",
    "boolean functions can be built by composition of `` smaller '' functions , e.g.  a ternary function @xmath54 can be obtained starting from two binary functions @xmath64 and @xmath137 as @xmath138 .",
    "this permits the definition of a small `` vocabulary '' of atomic functions , from which _ boolean expressions _ , corresponding to larger functions , can be constructed by composition . as the basic building blocks for logic functions",
    ", we choose the two binary functions and ( @xmath139 ) and or ( @xmath140 ) , and the unary function not ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the set @xmath142 is functionally complete , meaning that the three atomic functions can be composed to represent all possible functions of @xmath1 literals .",
    "notice that @xmath143 is not minimal , as both @xmath139 and @xmath140 could be expressed by means of the other two connectives .",
    "however , it is a very natural generating set , as it is tightly linked to the representation of functions in terms of their truth table .    the two - dimensional _ morphospace _ we use summarises each function by two quantities : bias and complexity .",
    "bias measures the average value taken by the function , and is therefore an indicator of the asymmetry between the `` on '' ( 1 ) and `` off '' ( 0 ) output states .",
    "the _ bias _",
    "@xmath28 ( or _ on / off asymmetry _ ) of a boolean function @xmath54 is the fraction of input combinations for which @xmath54 is true , namely @xmath144 where the sums are over all possible input combinations @xmath135 ( hence @xmath145 for a function of @xmath1 variables ) .    defining complexity , as in kolmogorov s definition , requires the specification of a description language .",
    "a natural language for logic functions is that of _ disjunctive normal forms _ ( dnf ) . as described in the text , these are boolean expressions built with the elements of our base set @xmath143 , such that they take a canonical form , namely a disjunction of conjunctive clauses , in terms of literals and their negations .",
    "a dnf is said to be _ full _ if each literal appears exactly once in each conjunctive clause .",
    "if a logic function @xmath54 is expressed via its truth table , then its full dnf can be immediately constructed , simply by listing all combinations of truth values for which @xmath54 is true .",
    "for instance , the function xor@xmath146 , which is true if exactly one of its literals @xmath33 is true , can be written as @xmath147 .",
    "let us define the _ length _ @xmath148 of a dnf @xmath149 as the number of clauses , i.e. , the number of terms separated by @xmath140 operators ) .",
    "the bias of the function is then equal to the length of the full dnf .",
    "each term in a dnf can be considered as an autonomous sub - function of a number @xmath84 of literals , defining a _ k - cell _ in the function s truth table .",
    "a @xmath84-cell of a function is a subset of input combinations for which the function is true and such that it can be expressed , when restricted to those combinations , as a single conjunctive term @xmath150 ( possibly with negations ) , all other @xmath94 literals remaining free .",
    "the full disjunctive normal form is typically not a compact representation of a function . as an extreme case ,",
    "consider the _ tautology _ of @xmath1 variables : its bias is @xmath72 and its full dnf has @xmath44 terms .",
    "however , a much shorter dnf is for instance @xmath42 ( where @xmath127 is any literal ) , which is still in dnf and has length 2 , thus defining the same function with a much shorter expression . as discussed in the text ,",
    "complexity is expected to measure the minimal amount of information one has to specify when defining an entity .",
    "having fixed dnfs as the natural language , it is then straightforward to define the complexity of a logic function as follows",
    ".    let us denote by @xmath151 the set of all the dnfs of the function @xmath54 ( it is a finite set if repetitions of clauses are prohibited ) .",
    "the _ complexity _",
    "@xmath43 of a boolean function is the length of its shortest disjunctive normal form , normalised by the length of its truth table , namely @xmath152 where @xmath135 is as in definition  1 .      since the full dnf belongs to @xmath151 , and its length is the number of 1s in the truth table , the inequality @xmath47 holds in general .",
    "it is interesting to note that the parity function of @xmath1 variables , for which @xmath45 , has the largest possible complexity , namely @xmath153 ( the sequence of its values realises a fractal known as the _ thue - morse sequence _ ) .",
    "this is easily proved by noting that if there existed any cell containing more than one element , than it would contain at least two combinations of inputs having different parities .",
    "parity functions are used in various contexts , due to their symmetry and tractability @xcite .",
    "the _ robustness _ @xmath105 of a boolean function @xmath54 is the fraction of pairs @xmath154 such that @xmath155 , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are two combinations of inputs differing only in the value of one variable ( i.e. , their hamming distance @xmath158 is 1 ) , namely @xmath159    tautologies and their negations have the highest robustness , namely @xmath160 , as changing the value of any variable never changes the result . the parity function , on the contrary , has the lowest robustness , @xmath161 , since by definition a single flip of any of its variables changes the function s value .",
    "remark that this definition of @xmath105 fixes a specific scale for the fluctuations , namely only @xmath72 variable . the analogous definition where one considers @xmath107 flips would assign minimum complexity to parity functions . however , the results presented in the text are unaffected by the number of variables flipped , showing that the relation between robustness and complexity is robust .            c.  a. hidalgo , r.  hausmann , the building blocks of economic complexity , proceedings of the national academy of sciences 106  ( 26 ) ( 2009 ) 1057010575 .",
