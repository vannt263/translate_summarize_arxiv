    "nonequilibrium fluctuations in mesoscopic systems can present additional information that is not reflected in their dc transport characteristics .",
    "this is one of the reasons why `` shot noise '' ( i.e.  nonequilibrium fluctuations of current with constant or nearly - constant spectral density at low frequencies ) has attracted so much attention in mesoscopics during the last decade - see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an additional motivation for the present paper was provided by the observation @xcite that the smallness of the shot noise is a necessary condition for quasi - continuous electron transfer .",
    "more exactly , for an external observer a conductor provides effectively ohmic ( quasi - continuous ) conduction only if the so - called fano factor @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the low - frequency density of current fluctuations , and @xmath5 is the average current ) is much lower than 1 .",
    "if simultaneously the resistance of such a sample is sufficiently high , and its stray capacitance is low , @xmath6 it may be used for resistive coupling in single - electron devices . since using resistively - coupled devices is one of the very few options available to avoid the forbidding problem of random background charge in single - electronics ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the search for systems with quasi - continuous conduction is important for possible future applications of single - electron devices in integrated circuits .",
    "shot noise has been extensively analyzed for metallic conduction ( in both ballistic @xcite and diffusive @xcite limits ) and for single - electron tunneling .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , metallic conductors can satisfy the condition @xmath7 only if they are much longer than the electron - phonon interaction length .",
    "@xcite as a result eqs .",
    "( [ c<<e2/t ] ) can be practically met only at very low temperatures - see , e.g. , experiment @xcite .",
    "the same is true for single - electron circuits ( like 1d or 2d arrays ) with their relatively large islands @xcite .",
    "much higher resistance @xmath8 at small sample length ( and hence small @xmath9 ) is typical for hopping conductors - see , e.g. , refs .",
    "naively , one might think that since the hopping transport is due to discrete single electron tunneling events ( `` hops '' ) , the shot noise should be close to the schottky value ( @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 ) . however , this argument is obviously not true , since it could also be applied to a 1d series array of @xmath0 tunnel junctions . a simple `` circuit '' theory @xcite",
    "( see also appendix ) shows that for such an array the fano factor can be very small : @xmath12 the physical reason for this fact is that the noise originating from each junction is strongly shunted by the junction resistance , which is much smaller than the total resistance of other junctions .",
    "thus , there is hope of having the shot noise at hopping suppressed well below the schottky value as well .",
    "however , the real picture of hopping is complex , and the noise may be much higher than the simple estimate given above .",
    "for example , mutual correlation of the hopping events , exponentially broad distribution of their rates due to sample randomness , and the percolative character of transport paths in 2d and 3d cases @xcite may all be important factors . until recently , the situation was virtually unexplored : the few publications on the theory of noise in hopping we are aware of ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) concentrate on @xmath13 noise rather than on the broadband shot noise.@xcite we are also unaware of any experimental studies of noise at hopping at frequencies high enough to avoid @xmath13 noise dominance .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop an initial picture of shot noise at hopping .",
    "we will focus on the 1d case , and assume uniformity of hopping conditions between all the sites .",
    "( a brief analysis of nonuniform systems and higher dimensions is given in discussion . ) in principle , 1d hopping may be implemented experimentally using a linear array of quantum dots between two external electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ schematic]a ) . besides this geometry",
    ", we will also consider a somewhat artificial model of hopping on a ring ( fig .",
    "[ schematic]b ) , at least because problems with periodic boundary conditions are traditional in theoretical studies of hopping . besides that",
    ", since such models automatically conserve the total electron number , they may crudely mimic `` open '' models ( fig .",
    "[ schematic]a ) with considerable coulomb interaction without its explicit account .    throughout our analysis",
    "we will assume that the electron states localized at each site are non - degenerate , so that each site may be occupied with just one electron , or none .",
    "this model can be viewed as a special case of the `` orthodox '' theory of single - electron tunneling @xcite when the background charge of each island is close to @xmath14 , so that energies of two charge states ( @xmath15 = 0 and @xmath15 = 1 ) are close to each other while other states are far beyond the available energy range .",
    "so , the well - developed theory of noise based either on fokker - planck @xcite or langevin @xcite approach can be directly applied to any hopping structure with arbitrary electron - electron interaction .",
    "however , these approaches involve taking into account an exponentially large number of charge configurations , thus limiting practical calculations to relatively small structures , @xmath16 .",
    "this is why for the numerical results we have used the monte - carlo approach , similar to that used for simulations of transport @xcite and noise @xcite at single - electron tunneling , with the corresponding restriction of the site state number .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results for the shot noise at 1d hopping and at tunneling in 1d array of tunnel junctions .",
    "some formulas necessary for this comparison are derived in appendix for the cases of negligible and small charge discreteness effects .",
    "in the hopping limit , where quantum interference between states before and after each hopping event is neglected because of the inelastic nature of electron transport , @xcite site occupation numbers may be considered as random classical variables .",
    "if we are not interested in extremely high frequencies ( when the finite photon energy becomes important ) , current @xmath17 flowing between the @xmath18th and @xmath19th site may be considered as a sum of infinitely short pulses : @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the time of @xmath23th hop in the positive ( negative ) direction between the sites . in the `` open boundary '' problem ( fig .",
    "[ schematic]a ) , with a fixed voltage across the sample , we may also consider currents @xmath24 flowing in external electrodes.@xcite these currents contain contributions not only from the hops to and from the electrodes , but also the polarization charge changes ( displacement current contribution ) due to hops between internal sites : @xmath25 where the factors @xmath26 depend on the structure geometry and can be expressed via its electrostatic matrix .",
    "( in general , these coefficients are different for the left and right electrodes . ) in the simplest case of a 1d array between two infinite parallel metallic plates , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is transport direction component of @xmath19th hop vector . in this work",
    ", we will use this formula , with @xmath30 const ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) , even for the ring geometry ( fig .",
    "[ schematic]b ) , though this model does not have any electrodes .",
    "this assumption is not critical for the fano factor which does not depend on @xmath32 , since at low frequencies the spectral densities of all currents @xmath33 and @xmath34 coincide .",
    "( a simple proof of this statement may be obtained from the spectral density definition @xmath35 in the limit @xmath36 , using the condition that the charge can not accumulate indefinitely inside the array ) . in the opposite limit of high frequencies ( much higher than the average tunneling rate , though still much lower than the reciprocal `` time of tunneling '' , which is considered infinitely short in our theory ) , the spectral densities of currents @xmath33 and @xmath34 are typically different , and obey a simple formula .",
    "in fact , in the high - frequency limit all tunnel events are effectively uncorrelated and the phases of factors @xmath37 in eq .  ( [ sdef ] ) are random . from this , we obtain @xmath38 it is easy to see that for the current through one barrier @xmath39 , while for the external current @xmath40",
    ". we will mostly be interested in the readily measurable quantity @xmath41 and its low frequency value @xmath42 .",
    "for the numerical ( monte - carlo ) calculations of the spectral density we have directly used@xcite eq .",
    "( [ sdef ] ) .",
    "the time period @xmath43 is chosen to be sufficiently long and the averaging is done over many such time periods . in practical calculations , it is important to keep the product @xmath44 integer in order to avoid numerical inaccuracy at low frequencies , and it is convenient to calculate simultaneously the spectral density at several overtones of certain basic ( low ) frequency . for several figures we have also used the newly developed method for the calculation of spectral density , which gives much faster convergence ; this method will be described elsewhere .",
    "we start with the auxiliary problem of hopping of a fixed number ( @xmath45 ) of electrons on a uniform ring of @xmath46 sites .",
    "the electron may hop to either of the neighboring sites , i.e.  either clockwise ( with a probability rate of @xmath47 ) or counterclockwise ( with rate @xmath48 ) , but only if the accepting site is empty .",
    "the rates @xmath49 should satisfy the gibbs relation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the energy difference between the neighboring sites .",
    "( due to the circular geometry , a conceptually sound , though impractical , way to create this difference is to increase the magnetic flux through the ring area at a constant rate .",
    "however , we consider the circular array mostly as a simplification of the realistic linear array . )    for the comparison of the current noise with the nyquist formula we will need the total resistance of the ring which is naturally defined as @xmath52 where the total `` voltage '' @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 ( the dependence of the tunneling rate on @xmath51 can be arbitrary ) .    in the final part of our analysis",
    "we will include the particle interaction following the unscreened coulomb law , so that the potential energy of the system is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the site occupied by the @xmath19th electron .",
    "the interaction is included into the model by adding the corresponding change of @xmath57 at a hop to that @xmath58 describing the external field . since in this case the tunneling rates are no longer constant , we will need to specify an explicit relation @xmath59 . in this case",
    "we will assume @xmath60 where @xmath61 gives the scale of the effective resistance of a tunnel barrier between adjacent sites .",
    "let us assume @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite then the current @xmath24 consists of uncorrelated pulses , each transferring the charge @xmath63 , with rates @xmath47 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "this is equivalent to the conventional case of one tunnel junction with the electron charge substituted by @xmath65 , hence @xmath66 and the spectral density is frequency - independent,@xcite @xmath67 , with @xmath68    figure [ coth ] shows the corresponding fano factor @xmath69 , as a function of @xmath51 . in thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "@xmath70 , the noise satisfies the nyquist formula , @xmath71 , which remains valid while @xmath72 . at @xmath73",
    "the fano factor tends to infinity because the average current vanishes while the equilibrium thermodynamic fluctuations still produce a finite current noise . for @xmath74",
    "the fano factor crosses unity at @xmath75 .",
    "let us emphasize that since @xmath76 , the noise at this crossover is still due to thermodynamically equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "finally , if the applied field is high ( @xmath77 ) , the fano factor is low : @xmath78 thus , as a matter of principle the shot noise suppression at hopping may be really very strong ( proportional to the array length , just as in tunnel junction arrays ) .",
    "now let us examine how this suppression is affected by various factors .      at @xmath79 ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) and in the absence of coulomb interactions ( @xmath81 ) , but for arbitrary electron density @xmath82 our model is reduced to the so - called asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) model which has been extensively studied during the past few years  for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite . within this model ,",
    "all @xmath83 possible charge configurations of the system have equal probability for the arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite from this fact , the average current is readily calculated to equal @xmath84 so that for a large system ( @xmath85 ) @xmath86 notice that these expressions ( as well as those below ) are obviously symmetric over the transformation @xmath87 which interchanges electrons and holes . from eq .",

    "equation ( [ < i > ] ) is exactly the result which could be anticipated in the complete absence of correlation between the hops .",
    "however , in fact these correlations _ do _ exist , as revealed , for example , by the spectral density of the current .",
