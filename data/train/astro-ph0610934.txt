    "it has been well established that cold dark matter dominates the gravity on large scales in our universe .",
    "this is also true in clusters of galaxies for which observations via galaxy kinematics , x - ray imaging spectroscopy and lensing techniques have all given unassailable evidences that as much as about @xmath15% of the gravitating mass is made of dark matter ( see , e.g. , arnaud 2005 for a recent review ) .",
    "on galactic scales , kinematic studies of spiral galaxies via measurements of the rotation curves obtained with the radio hi and co lines , as well as the optical h@xmath16 and [ oiii ] lines also have revealed the existence of a significant amount of unseen mass whose fraction rises steadily outwards ( sofue & rubin 2001 ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios deduced from the observed constant rotation curves typically increase up to a few tens @xmath14  within the last observed point , inferring a fraction of dark matter ranging from about 50% in the sa and sb galaxies to about 90% in the sd and sm galaxies .    within the frame of the hierarchical models of galaxy formation and the theories of galaxy mergers ,",
    "such a remarkable amount of dark mass is also expected in elliptical galaxies , especially in those luminous ellipticals who are more massive than their spiral counterparts .",
    "however , in elliptical galaxies the stars move in random , usually non - circular orbits , and there is a lack of obvious rotation velocity tracers like bright hi regions , particularly at large projected radii ( @xmath17@xmath1 , where @xmath1  is the effective radius ) where the dark matter is considered to be important .",
    "so technically it is hard to model the 3d radial gradients and anisotropies in the velocity tensor field .",
    "in addition , in a bright elliptical galaxy the diffuse gas emission is usually heavily contaminated by the emission from a large population of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "instruments with high spatial resolution and large effective areas are needed to disentangle the two components from each other accurately in the x - ray study of the gravitational potential well .    despite of the difficulties , however , some early stellar photometric and kinematic works ( e.g. , saglia et al . 1992 ; bertin et al . 1994 ; carollo et al .",
    "1995 ) have indicated that in some ellipticals there may be as much dark matter as the luminous component within @xmath18@xmath1 .",
    "the derived mass - to - light ratios range from a few to a few tens of @xmath14  with a tendency that the dark matter overwhelms the luminous matter at large radii , which supports the possible homology of the galaxy formation processes between the ellipticals and spirals ( bertola et al .",
    "as the absorption line profile measurements in elliptical galaxies improve in recent years , the uncertainties in the rotation and velocity dispersion analyses caused by the degeneracy between anisotropy and mass distribution have been mitigated .",
    "gerhard et al . ( 2001 ) found that the circular velocity curves ( cvcs ) of luminous ellipticals are flat to within 10% in regions from @xmath19@xmath1  out to 1 - 2@xmath1 , and they argued that about @xmath20 of the mass is dark within 1@xmath1 . in general ,",
    "these kinematic and dynamic results are backed by the lensing measurements ( kochanek 1995 ; griffiths et al .",
    "1996 ; keeton et al . 1998 ) and the x - ray imaging and spectroscopic observations ( e.g. , forman et al .",
    "1985 ; mushotzky et al . 1994 ; buote & canizares 1994 , 1998 ; buote et al . 2002 ; loewenstein & white 1999 ; fukazawa et al .",
    "2006 ; humphrey et al .",
    "2006b ) , as well as by the most recent photometric and dynamic analyses of more than 2000 sdss galaxies ( lintott et al . 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , the superb high spatial resolution of the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory also allowed buote et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to examine the position angle twist and ellipticity of the x - ray image of ngc 720 with high precision .",
    "the authors argued that there is a strong geometric evidence for dark matter , which is independent of the temperature profile and is hard to be explained by the modified gravity theories as an alternative to dark matter ( e.g. , milgrom 1983 ) .",
    "so far , however , unlike for the spiral galaxies the observational constraints on the dark matter content in ellipticals are diverse from case to case and , in some cases , unambiguous or even controversial . for example",
    ", in the samples of saglia et al . (",
    "1992 ) , bertin et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) the kinematic and dynamic evidence for dark matter is found rather weak in some galaxies , which include the bright cd galaxy ngc 1399 .",
    "a constant mass - to - light ratio can not be ruled out with implication of no or less dark matter . in 2001",
    "baes & dejonghe pointed out that after correcting for the dust absorption and scattering the need of dark matter in a few @xmath1  may be reduced or eliminated in the kinematic study .",
    "recently , romanowsky et al . ( 2003 ) reported their analysis of the planetary nebula ( pn ) kinematics in the e1 galaxy ngc 3379 , where the random stellar velocities are found to decline with radius .",
    "the calculated @xmath21 is consistent with a constant , which infers a low dark matter fraction ( @xmath22 ) at 5 @xmath1 , obviously conflicting with the standard galaxy formation theories . in order to respond to this challenge , dekel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) carried out merger simulations of disk galaxies and argued that the observed low random stellar velocities may be explained away in terms of the radial orbits of the halo stars that have been tidally ejected from the inner regions during merger events .",
    "no matter what the final conclusion may be , these examples clearly show the uncertainties in determining the dark matter content in elliptical galaxies .",
    "a correct estimation of the stellar mass is crucial for probing dark matter distribution in early - type galaxies . in previous works",
    "it is sometimes assumed that stellar mass - to - light ratio is spatially constant throughout the galaxy , and in few cases a certain `` typical value '' was adopted . however , with the well - calibrated i - band data for 25 e / s0 galaxies cappellari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the stellar mass - to - light ratio distributions in the early - type galaxies show a remarkable variation from source to source by a factor of about 5 , with a root mean square deviation of about 35% for the sample .",
    "this variation is likely to be beyond the uncertainties induced in the stellar population model , which primarily arise in the line - strength calibration and the model assumption on the imf profile and so on .",
    "moreover , in a galaxy there is possibly a measurable spatial variation of stellar mass - to - light ratio on the @xmath18@xmath1  scales , as is implied by the measured optical line index gradients ( rampazzo et al .",
    "2005 ) and optical b - r color gradients ( e.g. , tamura & ohta 2003 , 2004 ; forte et al .",
    "a straightforward example is the kinematic study of 21 round elliptical galaxies by kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who found that the stellar mass - to - light ratio may vary with radius by a factor of up to @xmath5 in a few galaxies .",
    "padmanabhan et al . ( 2004 ) also reported a @xmath23 variation of the stellar mass - to - light ratio in some cases based on their comprehensive study of sdss data .",
    "as a step to get more insight into the dark matter distribution in early - type galaxies , in this paper we present a multi - band study of the mass distributions in the bright elliptical galaxy ngc 1407 ( e0 , @xmath24=0.0059 ) and its associated group by incorporating both the spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopic data and optical multi - color photometric and line - strength data . in order to cover as wide a spatial range as possible , meanwhile , without the loss of the high spatial resolution in the central region , we drew the x - ray data from both the _ chandra _  and _ rosat _  archives to probe the total mass and gas mass distributions , and drew the optical data from the literatures to calculate the stellar mass profile with a forward method .",
    "ngc 1407 is a non - cd , dominating galaxy that sits at the bottom of the group s gravitational potential well . according to the latest survey of trentham et al .",

    "after removing the contamination of all the visually resolved points sources , we examined both the s1 chip and the boundary regions of the s3 chip where the emission of the diffuse gas is relatively weak .",
    "no background flare is found during the live operating time , which would otherwise significantly increase the count rate .",

    ", we totally detected 41 point sources within the central @xmath5@xmath1 , of which up to about 4 are probably unrelated background sources according to a monte - carlo simulation test based on the deep _ chandra _ observations of blank fields ( mushotzky et al .",
    "we find that none of the resolved sources is identified with an optical counterpart .",
    "the spatial distribution of the point sources is nearly symmetric , which shows a clear concentration towards the galactic center .",
    "the source number density follows the b- and r - band optical light distributions approximately , indicating that most of them are intrinsically associated with the galaxy . in our previous work ( zhang & xu 2004 ) we studied the x - ray colors of these sources and their contribution to the total x - ray luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we found that within 2@xmath1  in 0.310 kev the resolved point sources account for about 18% of the total emission ; if the unresolved sources are taken into account , about 39% of the total emission in 0.310 kev can be ascribed to lmxbs .",
    "the combined spectrum of all resolved off - center x - ray point sources can be well fitted with a single power - law model ( @xmath59 ) when the absorption is fixed to the galactic value ( @xmath60 @xmath61 ; dickey & lockman , 1990 ) .    the brightest point source ( src 1 ) is detected at the x - ray peak of ngc 1407 and has a total net count of @xmath62 cts , or an average count rate of @xmath63 in 0.310 kev .",
    "previous to the _ chandra _  observation , there is no report about the detection of this source in x - rays .",
    "we have attempted to detect the possible temporal variabilities of this source on different time scales . in terms of the k - s test",
    ", the temporal variability of the source is less significant , possibly because k - s tests are most sensitive around the median value of the independent variable .",
    "however , the visual inspection of the lightcurve suggests that it is variable on timescales of 2.5 - 3 hr during which its count rate changed significantly by about @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which is supported by the calculated variability parameter @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the maximum and minimum fluxes , respectively , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are corresponding errors . we fitted the acis spectrum of the central source with an absorbed power - law model . to avoid the relatively poor calibration at low energies and instrumental background at high energies , we limited the fittings to 0.77 kev .",
    "the absorption was fixed to the galactic value since allowing it to vary did not improve the fit .",
    "the fit is acceptable ( @xmath70=10.2/11 ) and the best - fit photon index is @xmath71 ( table 1 ) , which is steeper than that of the accumulative spectrum of the off - center sources .",
    "we also have attempted to fit the spectrum of src 1 with an absorbed multi - color disk blackbody model .",
    "however , the fitting is rejected with large residuals in both the low energy and high energy ends ( @xmath70=27.8/11 ) .",
    "we estimate that the 0.310 kev luminosity of src 1 is @xmath72 . this value is higher than that of the central sources in ngc 4472 and ngc 4649 ( soldatenkov et al .",
    "2003 ) by one order of magnitude .",
    "thus , we speculate that the central source may be an embedded low luminosity agn because of its central location , rapid temporal variations , strong x - ray emissions and the appearance of a weak jet - like radio structure associated with it . if the source is an agn , by using the tight relation between the black hole mass and the galaxy central velocity dispersion @xmath73 as was given in merritt & ferrarese ( 2001 ) , and the central velocity dispersion of @xmath74 km s@xmath31 that is taken from mcelroy ( 1995 ) , we estimate the mass of the black hole as @xmath75 @xmath12 .",
    "quite similar results can be obtained if the @xmath76-@xmath77 relation derived alternatively by wyithe ( 2006 ) for a local sample of 31 galaxies and the central velocity dispersion of bernardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ; 279 km s@xmath31 ) are adopted instead .",
    "in the _ chandra _  spectral analysis of the acis s3 data the usual way to obtain a background spectrum , which primarily consists of the cosmic , instrumental and non x - ray particle components , is to utilize the observation dataset directly by extracting the background spectrum from a local , uncontaminated region on the s3 chip that is located far away enough from the source .",
    "alternatively we may draw the background spectrum from the _ chandra _  blank field datasets in the same detector region where the source spectrum is extracted . to avoid 1 ) the field - to - field variations in the cosmic background , which is typically of the order of a few tens percent on arcmin scales and even more remarkable on larger scales , and 2 ) the time - dependent variations in the particle and instrumental backgrounds that may be significant in some observations ,",
    "the use of former method is more preferred in practice whenever it is applicable .",
    "ngc 1407 is dominating a nearby group that is rich in x - ray gas .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission of the group spans over a wide region that covers the whole _",
    "chandra _",
    "field of view .",
    "as we will show in  5.1 , the diffuse soft emission of the gas extends outwards to about 10.3 @xmath1  ( @xmath48 ) . at the edge of acis s3 chip , the emission from the hot gas",
    "is estimated to account for about @xmath78 of the total flux in 0.77 kev .",
    "thus we are precluded from extracting a clean background spectrum directly in the ccd boundary regions . for the spectral fittings of the inner regions",
    "this will not be a problem ; the x - ray background therein is overwhelmed by the emission of the galaxy in the selected bandpass , so even the _ chandra _  blank field spectra can be applied as a good approximation of the real background if its high energy end , where the instrumental effects dominate , is well normalized to the observation .",
    "however , for the outer regions the use of the blank field spectra may result in severe misestimates of the model parameters due to the spatial and temporal variations of the different background components that may have changed their relative strengths .",
    "in fact , when we examined the spectrum extracted from the source - free region on the bi chip s1 , we found that there is an extra hard component as compared with the blank field spectrum .",
    "such a hard excess is also seen in the spectrum extracted in the boundary region of the s3 chip in 310 kev , where the gas emission is relatively weak .",
    "the extra hard component found on the s1 and s3 chips are quite similar in spectral energy distribution , which can both be described by a power - law model with @xmath79 .",
    "the nature of this extra hard component is unclear .",
    "possibly it is a feature of the local cosmic background , or it is induced by particle events .",
    "therefore , the use of the blank field spectra should be rejected in our analysis .    in order to construct the _ chandra _",
    "s3 background spectrum , we extracted the spectrum of a @xmath80 region at the boundary of the s3 chip and then subtracted the contaminating soft emission component contributed by the hot diffuse gas from it .",
    "the selected region is located at about @xmath81 away from the galactic center , which is well beyond the outermost annulus used to extract the source spectra . as will be shown in  4.2 ,",
    "the contribution of lmxbs is negligible .",
    "we modeled the gas emission with an absorbed apec component , whose temperature ( @xmath82=1.30 kev ) and abundance ( @xmath83=0.21 solar ) are obtained by studying the _ rosat _  pspc spectrum extracted from the same region . since in the _ rosat _  fittings the normalization of the apec component is not well constrained , we deduced it from the modeling of the pspc surface brightness profile (  5.1 ) .",
    "we find that in the selected background region the obtained acis s3 background accounts for @xmath84 of the total counts in 0.77 kev and has a spectral energy distribution consistent with that obtained for the source - free region on the acis s1 chip .",
    "the calculated background level also agrees with that derived in the analysis of the x - ray surface brightness profile (  5.1 ) and that used in humphrey et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "in 0.22 kev where the particle and instrument components are minor , the deduced background count rate is close the average x - ray background count rate from the rosat all - sky survey diffuse background maps , which is available at http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov .    for the _ rosat _  pspc spectral analysis , we extracted the background spectrum from a region about @xmath85 away from the galactic center , where the 0.22 kev surface brightness (  5.1 ) is less than @xmath42 above the mean local pspc background level ( @xmath86 cts @xmath61 s@xmath31 arcmin@xmath87 ) .",
    "we performed both the projected and deprojected spectral analyses of the _ chandra _  and _ rosat _   spectra by using a model that consists of an apec and power - law component , both subjected to a common absorption . in the deprojected analysis , we used the xspec model `` projct '' to evaluate the influence of the outer spherical shells onto the inner ones . in the _ chandra _  spectral fittings , we extracted the acis s3 spectra from 4 annular regions that are centered at the x - ray peak .",
    "we limited the energy range to 0.77 kev to minimize the effects of both the instrumental background at higher energies and the calibration uncertainties at lower energies . by applying the latest caldb",
    "we also have corrected for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) and continuous degradation in the acis quantum efficiency , which is especially severe at low energies . to compensate for the degradation of the acis energy resolution we included an additional 5% systematic error .",
    "we first restricted the fittings to 3.57 kev , where the gas emission is typically less than @xmath88 and thus can be ignored .",
    "we found that an absorbed power - law model can give an acceptable fit to the spectra , and the obtained absorptions and photon indices are consistent with the galactic value and photon index for the resolved off - center point sources ( @xmath89 ;  3.2 ) , respectively .",
    "thus , to achieve a better statistics in the fittings of the 0.77 kev spectra , we fixed the photon indices to 1.59 and adopted the normalizations of the power - law components as have been obtained in 3.57 kev .",
    "again , we fixed the absorption to the galactic value because if we allow it to vary , the fitting did not improve .",
    "the best - fits are shown in table 1 .",
    "we see that the deprojected analysis gives acceptable fits , while the projected fits are poor for the inner three annuli .",
    "the residual distributions indicate a second thermal component needed for these annuli , which is most probably caused by the projection effect .",
    "we extracted the _ rosat _  pspc spectra in 0.22 kev from 8 annular regions , with the 4 inner annuli chosen as the same as for the _ chandra _  analysis and the outer 4 annuli spanning over @xmath90 @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the soft emission of the gas always dominates in the spectra .",
    "for the inner 4 regions , we estimate that the hard emission component , which is mostly from lmxbs , account for up to @xmath91 of the 0.22 kev flux . technically it is difficult to disentangle such a weak , hard component from the dominating soft emission component precisely in the limited bandpass of pspc .",
    "therefore when we fitted the _ rosat _",
    "spectra of the inner 4 regions we always fixed the ratio of hard component to soft component referring to the _ chandra _  results . for the outer 4 annuli",
    ", there is evidence that the relative contribution of the hard component is even lower .",
    "forbes et al .",

    "this casts some doubts on the identity of ngc 1400 as a virialized member in the group . since ngc 1400 is likely to be at the distance of the ngc 1407 group , as was suggested by perrett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who compared the shapes of gc luminosity functions of ngc 1400 and ngc 1407 , the observed unusually large peculiar velocity may imply that ngc 1400 is intruding into and merging with the group . by comparing the mass - to - light ratio of the ngc 1407 group with those listed in , e.g. , sanderson & ponman ( 2003 ) , we find",
    "that , similar to the ngc 1600 group , the ngc 1407 group is an extremely dark system even comparable to many clusters of galaxies .",
    "we find that the total mass distribution in the ngc 1407 group shows a slop change , or a flattened feature at about @xmath187@xmath1  ( 7.7 kpc ) . outside this radius the dark matter fraction increases rapidly",
    "this is in consistence with the result in the sample work of humphrey et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "this flattened feature may be caused by the change of the relative contribution of the gas mass as compared with the stellar mass .",
    "however , we notice that a similar feature is also seen on the mass profile of dark matter , to derive which the contributions of both bright and dwarf members have been carefully taken into account . to examine",
    "if the appearance of the flattened feature is model - dependent , we have repeated our calculations in  5.1 ,  5.3 and  5.4 by starting from the deprojected x - ray surface brightness profile ( e.g. , chatzikos et al .",
    "2006 ) , to derive which the background given in  4.1 is used .",
    "we find that within the errors the results agree nicely with what we presented above , indicating that the flattened , or the shoulder - like feature is intrinsic .",
    "we speculate that the slope changes on both the @xmath230  and @xmath186  profiles are likely to be a mark of the boundary between the galaxy and group halos , since in @xmath41@xmath1  we also observe a transition of the gas temperature from the galactic level ( @xmath0 kev ) to the group level ( @xmath2 kev ) .",
    "similar phenomenon and its analogs have been observed in clusters of galaxies ( ikebe 1995 ) ; xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; ettori et al . 2002 ; also makishima et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) , as well as in other groups ( ngc 4472 and ngc 4649 , brighenti & mathews 1997 ; ngc 507 , paolillo et al .",
    "2003 ; ngc 1600 , sivakoff et al . 2004",
    "; ic 1459 and ngc 1399 , fukazawa et al 2006 ; ngc 4125 and ngc 4261 , humphrey et al .",
    "we find that in more than half of these cases the slope change on mass profile appears at @xmath231 kpc , meanwhile in roughly half of the cases an outward temperature increase is observed .",
    "we also notice that the slope change is always seen in the cluster / group - dominating galaxies , or galaxies dominating a sub - cluster . in the isolated or nearly isolated elliptical galaxies , such as ngc 1404 ( paolillo et al .",
    "2002 ) , ngc 4555 ( osullivan & ponman 2004 ) , ngc 4636 ( brighenti & mathews 1997 ) and",
    "ngc 6482 ( humphrey et al .",
    "2006b ) , such a feature is not clearly detected . because ngc 6482 is believed to dominate a fossil group , the observed slope change on mass profile may finally vanish when the halo collapse enters the final stage .",
    "the mass distribution of ngc 1407 and its group in @xmath2@xmath1 , where the mass is dominated by dark matter , can be well fitted by a single nfw profile .",
    "the best - fit parameter are @xmath232@xmath1  ( @xmath202 ) or 3.5 @xmath1  ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "the derived concentration parameter c ( @xmath7 ) is within the range allowed for groups , but is beyond the 68% scatter for a halo at @xmath8 at the given @xmath9 ( gnedin and ostriker 2001 ; jing 2000 ) . despite of the relatively large errors we find that the inferred total mass and dark matter distributions within @xmath4@xmath1  are cuspy and",
    "can be approximated by power - law profiles with indices of @xmath233 , which are marginally consistent with the generalized nfw profiles with @xmath6 .",
    "like what was found in some other giant elliptical galaxies ( arimoto et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) , the calculated stellar metallicity in ngc 1407 is not spatially uniform .",
    "this is mostly determined by the observed spatial variations of the metal line indices , and is almost independent of the model assumptions on the imf profile and so on .",
    "the inward metallicity enhancement has been predicted by the monolithic collapse models ( e.g. , eggen et al .",
    "1962 ) . within the frame of such models ,",
    "more metal - rich stars were born in the inward - dissipating gas that had been enriched on their way towards the galactic center , meanwhile the evolving stellar winds tend to expel more metals out of the outer regions where the gravitational potential is shallow .",
    "numerical simulations show that the stellar metallicity gradients are also adjusted by mergers .",
    "although the mergers tend to smear out any existing gradients , they also may supply a large amount of gas and trigger star formation in the inner regions .",
    "so the resulting metallicity gradients are not necessary to be as steep as is predicted by the monolithic collapse models ( e.g. , sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) , as is observed in ngc 1407 .",
    "if the stellar metallicity gradient at @xmath234@xmath1   is indeed adjusted by gas inflows , by calculating the time that the gas therein needed to radiatively cool down to reach the current temperature ( @xmath0 kev ) , which is about 4 gyr , we tentatively estimate that such a gas inflow event should occurred at least 4 gyr ago . from then on the gas therein has sufficient time to reestablish an equilibrium state .",
    "by incorporating the _ chandra _  and _ rosat _  x - ray spectroscopic data with the optical line - strength indices and multi - color photometric data , we studied the mass distributions in the bright e0 galaxy ngc 1407 and its associated group . we find that the gas is single - phase with a temperature of @xmath0 kev within 1@xmath1  ( 1@xmath1  = 9.0 kpc ) , which quickly increases to @xmath2 kev in @xmath41@xmath1 .",
    "we reveal that the x - ray surface brightness profile shows a central excess in the innermost region , which coincides with a flattened feature at about @xmath3@xmath1  ( 7.7 kpc ) on the total mass and dark matter profiles .",
    "this feature is speculated to be a mark of the boundary between the galaxy and group halos , as has been seen in some other cluster / group - dominating galaxies .",
    "we find that the total mass and dark matter distributions within @xmath4@xmath1  ( 7.7 kpc ) are cuspy and can be approximated by power - law profiles with indices of @xmath233 , which are marginally consistent with the generalized nfw profiles .",
    "the mass in outer regions can be well fitted by a single nfw profile , and the derived concentration parameter c ( @xmath7 ) is larger than the 68% upper limit for a halo at @xmath8 at the given @xmath9 .",
    "we conclude that although the ngc 1407 group has a baryon - dominated core , it is an extremely dark system even comparable to many clusters of galaxies . at the virial radius @xmath10 kpc , the calculated mass and mass - to - light ratio are @xmath235",
    "@xmath12  and @xmath13 @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we also argue that the unusually large peculiar velocity of ngc 1400 may reflect the fact that the galaxy may have not be virialized in the group s gravitational potential well .",
    "we thank roberto rampazzo and annibalii for kindly providing us with the optical line - strength indices that are used in this paper .",

    "<S> we present a study of the mass distributions in the bright e0 galaxy ngc 1407 and its associated group by analyzing the high quality _ chandra _  and _ rosat _  x - ray spectroscopic data . in order to probe the stellar mass distribution we calculated the b - band mass - to - light ratio profile by comparing the observed line - strength indices and multi - color photometric data with different stellar synthesis model predictions . based on the recent survey results we also have modeled the contribution from other group members to the stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the gas is single - phase with a temperature of @xmath0 kev within 1@xmath1  ( 1@xmath1  = 9.0 kpc ) , which is typical for elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> outside 1@xmath1  the gas temperature increases quickly outwards to @xmath2 kev , indicating its group origin . with the high spatial resolution of _ chandra </S>",
    "<S> _  we reveal that the x - ray surface brightness profile shows a central excess in the innermost region , and on both the total mass and dark matter profiles there is a flattened feature at about @xmath3@xmath1 , which coincides with the gas temperature transition from the galactic level to the group level . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that this may be a mark of the boundary between the galaxy and group halos , as has been seen in some other cluster / group - dominating galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass and dark matter distributions within @xmath4@xmath1  are cuspy and can be approximated by power - law profiles with indices of @xmath5 , which are marginally consistent with the generalized nfw profiles with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass in outer regions can be well fitted by a single nfw profile , and the derived concentration parameter c ( @xmath7 ) is larger than the 68% upper limit for a halo at @xmath8 with the given @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ngc 1407 group has a baryon - dominated core , while the mass in the @xmath2@xmath1  is dominated by dark matter . at the virial radius @xmath10 kpc , the inferred mass and mass - to - light ratio are @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12  and @xmath13 @xmath14 , respectively , showing that the ngc 1407 group is an extremely dark system even comparable to many clusters of galaxies . since the obtained total mass is lower than those given in the earlier galaxy kinematic works , we speculate that ngc 1400 is not a virialized member in the group s gravitational potential well . </S>"
