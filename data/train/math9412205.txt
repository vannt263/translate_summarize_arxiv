    ", `` ray '' means a ray for the map @xmath80 .",
    "* step 1 * we first claim that the 1/3 and 2/3 rays land at a common fixed point . first , we show that every point of period less than or equal to two is real .",
    "there are ten total , one of which is the point at infinity .",
    "the remainder are the finite solutions of the equation @xmath485 .",
    "two solutions are the period 2 attractors 0 and -2 .",
    "another is the fixed point 2 , which is the landing point of the 0 ray in the basin of infinity .",
    "the remaining six solutions are roots of the polynomial @xmath486 , all of which are real .",
    "we next claim that the 1/3 and 2/3 rays in @xmath23 land at a common fixed point @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath32 is real , it commutes with conjugation , so @xmath487 .",
    "the landing point of @xmath488 is therefore the complex conjugate of the landing point of @xmath489 .",
    "but these landing points are points of period less than or equal to two , so by step 1 , they must be real and hence equal .",
    "since the two rays are exchanged under the dynamics , the common landing point @xmath72 is actually fixed under @xmath32 .",
    "* step 2 * let @xmath82 be the closed curve which is the union of the point at infinity , the 1/3 and 2/3 rays , and @xmath6 .",
    "we claim that @xmath82 separates 0 from -2 in . for otherwise , one component of @xmath11 of @xmath122",
    "is an open disc containing no elements of @xmath490 .",
    "the preimages of @xmath11 under @xmath491 are then all disjoint open discs .",
    "the curve @xmath82 is fixed as an oriented curve under @xmath491 .",
    "so for some preimage @xmath54 of @xmath11 under @xmath491 , @xmath492 , and so @xmath11 must be contained in the fatou set . but",
    "this then implies that @xmath82 can not separate @xmath50 , contradicting theorem [ rays_separate ] .",
    "* step 3 * we next claim that there is a unique ( up to combinatorial equivalence ) real degree three branched cover of the sphere with the same postcritical data . since any critically finite branched covering @xmath493 with @xmath494 and hyperbolic orbifold is thurston equivalent to a rational map , it suffices to prove there is a unique rational map with this data . by conjugating",
    "we may assume that infinity is a fixed simple critical point , 1 maps with local degree two to zero and -2 maps with local degree one to zero .",
    "these conditions imply that @xmath32 is of the form @xmath495 .",
    "if we require that zero is to map with local degree three onto its image and then back to itself , there are a unique parameters @xmath247 and @xmath496 , namely @xmath497 and @xmath498 .          for this map , a loop @xmath150 , separating 0 from -2 , and represented by the line ( iv ) in the bottom half of figure [ fig : semibasex ] union the point at infinity , has two preimages .",
    "one preimage is homotopic to @xmath150 and maps by degree @xmath499 , while the other is a closed curve mapping to @xmath150 by degree two , represented as the union of the point at infinity together with the two arcs in the top figure labelled ( iv ) passing through the pole @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath493 is thurston equivalent to @xmath32 , and @xmath82 corresponds to the curve @xmath150 under the obvious thurston equivalence , it follows that the curve @xmath82 must also have a preimage which maps to @xmath82 by degree two .",
    "hence the endpoints of @xmath500 and @xmath501 are necessarily distinct , implying that @xmath6 has three preimages in @xmath50 under @xmath32 . for any polynomial @xmath502 of degree @xmath14 with basin of infinity @xmath349 , @xmath503 , and",
    "so @xmath504 is totally invariant under @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath482 were topologically conjugate to a polynomial , a generic point in @xmath29 would then have three preimages , and so @xmath29 would be totally invariant under @xmath32 . since @xmath505 ,",
    "if @xmath29 is totally invariant , then so is @xmath2 , which it is not .",
    "hence @xmath482 can not be topologically conjugate to the dynamics of any polynomial on its julia set .",
    "* remark : * a similar proof works to show that the maps @xmath479 possess the same property . the only significant difference is that a different argument in step 1 is required .",
    "one can prove this using the fact that @xmath150 is fixed up to homotopy relative to @xmath506 as an unoriented curve under @xmath493 , together with the fact that the maps @xmath479 are expanding on their julia sets .",

    "there is an open topological arc @xmath515 mapping homeomorphically to @xmath516 ; this open arc is the portion of the boundary of the immediate basin of @xmath509 lying between the landing points of the @xmath517 and @xmath518 rays ; see figure [ pseudobasilica3 ] .",
