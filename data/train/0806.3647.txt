    "cavity polaritons are half - light half - matter quasiparticles resulting from the strong coupling of the photon mode of a microcavity with an exciton resonance of the embedded semiconductor structure  @xcite",
    ".    being mixed exciton - photon quasiparticles , the cavity polaritons have integer spins and can reveal bosonic properties  @xcite responsible for a number of interesting effects both predicted and observed , namely , stimulated scattering  @xcite , polariton lasing  @xcite , bose - einstein condensation  @xcite , superfluidity  @xcite etc .",
    "many important properties of the polaritonic systems are connected with their spin degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that an external magnetic field strongly affects non - linear dynamics of the polaritons and optical properties of polariton condensates .",
    "recently , the magnetic field induced suppression of polariton superfluidity and the so - called `` spin meissner effect '' have been predicted  @xcite .    for understanding of the rich variety of non - linear phenomena induced by magnetic field in microcavities a thorough knowledge of the linear properties of magneto - polaritons ( i.e. polaritons subject to a magnetic field ) is needed . though the problem on the surface seems simple it becomes really complex if the polarization of light is included into consideration .",
    "in particular , to the best of our knowledge , till now there was no accurate analysis of the dependence of eigenenergies of exciton - polariton modes and their polarization on the magnetic field .",
    "the present paper is aimed at filling the apparent gap in the theory of cavity polaritons .",
    "we expand the non - local dielectric response theory to describe oblique reflection and transmission of light through quantum wells ( qws ) in the presence of the magnetic field normal to the qw plane .",
    "we present also the transfer - matrix calculation of the eigenenergies and polarization of exciton - polaritons accounting for the te - tm splitting of cavity modes .",
    "finally , faraday rotation of the polarization plane of light passing through the microcavity is analyzed .",
    "the polarization of cavity polaritons depends on many factors . in the absence of the external magnetic field the exciton - polariton states having a non - zero in - plane wave vector ( @xmath0",
    "are linearly polarized due to the long range electron - hole exchange interaction  @xcite and te - tm splitting of the photonic mode of the cavity  @xcite .",
    "application of a magnetic field normal to the qw plane ( faraday geometry ) results in the zeeman splitting of the exciton doublet and thus changes the polarization of the polariton eigenstates from linear to elliptical or circular . as the bare photonic modes are unaffected by the magnetic field , the degree of circular polarization of exciton - polariton states is strongly dependent on the relative weights of photonic and excitonic components within the given polariton state . in strong magnetic fields these weights are field - dependent due to the shrinking of the wavefunction of the relative motion of the electron and hole in the real space resulting in an increase of the exciton - photon coupling strength .",
    "the interplay between these phenomena has not been addressed in its complexity to the best of our knowledge .",
    "experimentally , the magnetic field effect on the spectrum of exciton - polaritons in microcavities has been studied in 1990s by several groups  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field induced weak - strong coupling transition has been observed , and the enhancement of the rabi - splitting of the exciton - polariton modes with the magnetic field increase has been measured by means of _ cw _ and time - resolved optical spectroscopies .",
    "the shape and polarization of the polariton dispersion curves have not been studied , however .",
    "later on , mixing of the bright - polariton and dark exciton states due to the magnetic field applied in the cavity plane has been studied using the polarized photoluminescence  @xcite and time - resolved kerr rotation  @xcite techniques .",
    "theoretically , the dispersion of exciton - polaritons in microcavities in the absence of the magnetic field has been described in 1990s  @xcite , the magnetic field effect on the exciton - photon coupling strength has been calculated in  @xcite , and the exciton - polariton longitudinal - transverse splitting has been studied in detail in  @xcite .    the present paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we calculate the reflectivity of a qw structure in the presence of the external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the well plane . in the section iii",
    "we calculate the dispersion of magneto - exciton - polaritons in a microcavity and analyze their polarization . in section",
    "iv kerr and faraday effects in microcavities are discussed .",
    "for a heavy - hole exciton usually being the lowest energy exciton state in a qw , the allowed spin projection @xmath1 to the structure growth axis is either @xmath2 or @xmath3 depending on the mutual orientation of the electron and hole spins .",
    "the states with @xmath4 are decoupled from the cavity modes while the coupling of the @xmath3 states with the right or left circularly polarized cavity photons gives rise to the polariton doublets . in the following",
    "we will bound ourselves to consider only the bright states @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider the reflection of light incident at oblique angle on a qw which is sandwiched between the semi - infinite barriers and subject to the magnetic field @xmath6 normal to its plane .",
    "we shall take into account the zeeman splitting of the exciton resonance and neglect for a while the magnetic field effect on the orbital motion of electron and hole in the exciton .",
    "then the resonance frequencies of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 excitons can be presented respectively by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the bohr magneton , @xmath11 is the exciton @xmath11-factor , @xmath12 is the exciton resonance frequency given by @xmath13 @xmath14 is the effective band gap of the qw calculated with allowance for size - quantization energy , @xmath15 is the exciton binding energy , @xmath16 is the exciton translational mass and @xmath17 is its in - plane wave vector . the electric field of the electromagnetic wave is presented in the standard form @xmath18 , where the light frequency @xmath19 lies in the vicinity of the qw exciton resonance .",

    "we denote the structure growth axis as @xmath25 , and suppose that the light propagates in the @xmath26 plane . the electric field of te - polarized light is parallel to the @xmath27-axis while the electric field of tm - polarized light lies in the @xmath26 plane .",

    ", we remark that the amplitudes of the right and left circularly polarized components , @xmath33 or @xmath34 , are related to those of linearly polarized components by @xmath35 note that we consider only the polarization induced by heavy - hole exciton and do not take into account the @xmath25-component of the excitonic polarization which may be induced due to a light - hole exciton  @xcite , so that @xmath36 .    in the basis of circular polarized components the material equation has the form @xmath37 here",

    "equations represent the generalization of the expression for the dielectric polarization within the framework of the nonlocal model of the dielectric response for qws with a spin - degenerate exciton resonance .",
    "the condition @xmath44 allows one to decouple the equation for the @xmath25-component of the electromagnetic field from those for the @xmath45- and @xmath27-components which read @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 multiplying both parts of eq . by @xmath49 and integrating over @xmath25 from @xmath50 to @xmath51 one can obtain a closed set of equations for @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 here @xmath55 is a renormalization shift of the exciton resonance frequency due to the light - matter coupling effect at normal incidence in the absence of the external magnetic field , @xmath56 is the exciton radiative broadening in the same conditions , and @xmath57    in general , both the exciton resonance frequency and oscillator strength depend on the magnetic field due to the orbital motion of electron and hole .",
    "the magnetic field presses an electron and a hole to each other thus increases its binding energy and oscillator strength  @xcite .",

    "note that , due to the zeeman splitting of the exciton resonance into a circularly polarized doublet , the coupling of light with an exciton leads to the mixing of te and tm polarizations both in reflection and transmission .",
    "this results in the resonant faraday and kerr rotation and dichroism  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : faraday ] shows the angle of rotation of the polarization plane of transmitted light with respect to the polarization plane of incident light ( which is assumed to be te - polarized ) versus the angle of incidence for different energies close of the exciton resonance for the magnetic field of 2 t ( the induced zeeman splitting is 0.1 mev ) .",

    "we neglected the longitudinal - transverse splitting of the exciton .",
    "the difference between this approach and the rigorous formalism presented above consists in ( i ) neglecting of the coupling of four polariton modes with all other light modes in the cavity and ( ii ) disregarding of the polarization dependence of the light - matter coupling constant @xmath126  @xcite .",

    "the results match well except for the exciton - like branch ( red ) , the difference coming from the fact that in the exact model the exciton eigenstates are circularly polarized , whereas in the approximate model they are linearly polarized ( their te - tm splitting is taken into account ) .",
    "the circular polarization degree has been calculated using eq .   in both models , the difference being that in one case the complex amplitudes are the eigenvectors of exact system eq .   and in the other case they are the eigenvectors of approximate system eq .  .",
    "for such a small field , the splittings that appear in the polaritonic branches , are invisible relative to the rabi splitting , therefore we do not show the corresponding dispersions .",

    "inset shows energy dependence of faraday rotation angle at the same parameters at normal light incidence . ]    for example , the transmission and reflection coefficients in the @xmath134 polarization can be determined from the following system of equations @xmath146    figure  [ fig : cavityfaraday ] shows calculated faraday rotation angle at oblique incidence as a function of incidence angle .",
    "an inset in the figure presents the faraday rotation angle as a function of the energy .",
    "the function shows a non - monotonous behaviour reflecting the resonant character of light reflection and transmission in microcavities .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates that faraday rotation angles are almost by an order of magnitude larger than those for the faraday rotation in the case of a single quantum well .",
    "this enhancement can be interpreted as a result of multiple passage of a photon inside a cavity  @xcite .    namely , consider a cavity mode as a beam of light travelling back and forth inside the cavity .",
    "let @xmath147 be an average number of photon round trips between the bragg mirrors made during its life - time ( @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the cavity quality factor ) .",
    "at each trip the polarization plane of the photon exhibits a rotation by @xmath150 and the faraday effect is strongly enhanced .",
    "the observable faraday rotation angle is smaller than @xmath151 because there is a finite probability for the photon to escape cavity after any number of passages  @xcite .",
    "the absolute value of the faraday rotation angle decreases with the increase of the incidence angle , due to the decrease of the polariton lifetime in the cavity . in average , the polaritons make less rount - trips inside the cavity at oblique angles than at normal angle .",
    "we note that the kerr rotation angles ( observed in reflection geometry ) are smaller than the faraday rotation angles because the light reflection from the microcavity is dominated by a surface reflection of the bragg mirror .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the dispersion of the exciton - polaritons in a microcavity subjected into the external magnetic field taking in account both zeeman splitting of the exciton and te - tm splitting of the photonic modes .",
    "we have shown that the polarization of the polariton eigenstates is neither linear nor circular , but elliptical , in general .",
    "it is very sensitive to the polariton in - plane wave vector as well as to the detuning between the exciton and photon modes .",
    "we have also studied theoretically the faraday rotation in the planar microcavities .",
    "we found that the giant faraday rotation due to the multiple passages of light across the quantum well takes place at normal incidence , while this effect is reduced at oblique incidence angles .",

    "<S> the non - local dielectric response theory is extended to describe oblique reflection of light from quantum wells subjected to the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to calculate the dispersion and polarization of the exciton - polariton modes in semiconductor microcavities in the presence of a magnetic field normal to the plane of the structure . </S>",
    "<S> we show that due to the interplay between the exciton zeeman splitting and te - tm splitting of the photon modes , four polariton dispersion branches are formed with a polarization gradually changing from circular in the exciton - like part to linear in the photon - like part of each branch . </S>",
    "<S> faraday rotation in quantum microcavities is shown to be strongly enhanced as compared with the rotation in quantum wells . </S>"
