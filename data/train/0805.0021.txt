    "a filamentary dark cloud often provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate the formation and evolution of a dense cloud core , the birthplace of low - mass stars , through fragmentation processes .",
    "the dense cores appear to maintain themselves as substructures in the parental cloud that is known to be mostly governed by supersonic turbulence .",
    "the dense cores usually exhibit supersonic line widths ; the turbulence prevents the gravitational collapse of the cores .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the turbulence plays a fundamental role in controlling core formation processes ( e.g. , mac low & klessen 2004 ; ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "2007 for reviews and references therein ) .",
    "possible mechanisms for the core formation and collapse have a widespread range from the gradual release of magnetic support ( e.g. , shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) to the dynamical dissipation of turbulent waves ( e.g. , larson 1981 ; ostriker et al .",
    "2001 ; padoan & nordlund 2002 ) .",
    "although we now have a good overall picture of the theory of low - mass star formation ( e.g. , mckee & ostriker 2007 ) , observational verification of how dense cores form and collapse has produced limited success .",
    "there have been quite a few observational studies which have assessed the initial conditions for the gravitational collapse of a dense core .",
    "the low - mass protostar gf9 - 2 with bolometric luminosity and temperature of @xmath4   and @xmath5k , respectively ( wiesemeyer 1997 ) , remains the best - characterized extremely young protostar that would be a missing link between starless cores and class 0 protostars .",
    "the natal core of gf9 - 2 is believed to retain the initial conditions of the gravitational collapse because the central protostar has not launched an extensive outflow .",
    "namely the core has not yet been destroyed by an extensive outflow ( furuya et al .",
    "2006 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "our detailed analysis suggested that the core has undergone its gravitational collapse for @xmath6 years ( the free - fall time ) from initially unstable state ( larson 1969 ; penston 1969 ; hunter 1977 ) , and that the protostar has formed @xmath7 years ago .",
    "notice that the gf9 - 2 core is cross - identified as l1082c in benson & myers ( 1989 ) , lm351 in lee & myers ( 1999 , hereafter lm99 ) , and gf9-core in ciardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; the central young stellar object ( yso ) is also recognized as psc20503@xmath86006 .    besides the presence of gf9 - 2",
    ", the filamentary dark cloud gf9 ( schneider & elmegreen 1979 ) would be an ideal laboratory to establish a core formation scenario through the fragmentation of a filamentary cloud , because an iso imaging survey in the far - infrared has demonstrated the presence of several class 0 and i sources ( wiesemeyer 1997 ; wiesemeyer et al 1999 ) . towards our ultimate goal of defining an observational framework for the cloud core formation ,",
    "the first step is to investigate the physical properties of dense cores formed in the filament .",
    "we therefore performed an unbiased survey of dense cores in the gf9 filament .",
    "the filament has an extent of @xmath9 in the optical image ( schneider & elmegreen 1979 ) ; the eastern part of the cloud was firstly identified by lynds ( 1962 ) as l1082 .",
    "the distance ( @xmath10 ) to the gf9 cloud is still controversial , as discussed in grenier et al.(1989 ) and poidevin & bastien ( 2006 , and references therein ) . in order to keep consistency with paper i ,",
    "we adopt @xmath11 200pc , as reported by wiesemeyer ( 1997 ) , who derived the distance towards gf9 - 2 based on star counts , instead of 440pc ( viotti 1969 ) .",
    "we carried out simultaneous observations of the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines using the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45 m telescope over 16 days in 2006 april .",
    "we used the 22ghz cooled hemt receiver ( h22 ) which receives right- and left - hand circular polarization components simultaneously .",
    "the beam width ( @xmath12 ) and main - beam efficiency ( @xmath13 ) of the telescope were @xmath14 and @xmath15% , respectively , at 23.0ghz . to obtain the dual polarization data of the ( 1,1 ) line",
    ", we configured two auto correlator ( ac ) spectrometers having 8mhz bandwidth with 1024 channels ; the newly enhanced capability provided us with a factor of 3 times higher velocity resolution than the previous one .",
    "after on - line smoothing with the hamming window function , the effective velocity resolution ( ) for the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) lines is 0.180 km  s@xmath16 .",
    "for the ( 2,2 ) transition , we used two acousto - optical spectrometers ( aoss ) which provide of 0.494 km  s@xmath16 . here , we adopt the rest frequencies of 23694.4955mhz for the ( 1,1 ) transition ( ungerechts , walmsley & winnewisser 1980 ; hereafter uww80 ) and 23722.6336mhz for ( 2,2 ) ( lovas 1992 ) transition .",
    "we performed mapping observations under full - beam sampling to cover the whole of the gf9 filament previously imaged with the h@xmath17co @xmath18 absorption line ( gsten 1994 ) . using position - switching mode",
    ", we observed a total of 766 points by dividing the filament into 8 rectangular regions ; each region was mapped with a grid spacing of .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 4 hours and was found to be accurate within .",
    "the daily variation of the h22 receiver gain was checked by the peak antenna temperature ( ) of the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) emission towards the gf9 - 2 core center .",
    "we estimate that the final uncertainty in flux calibration is 22% .",
    "all the spectra were calibrated by the standard chopper wheel method and converted into the main - beam brightness temperature ( @xmath19 ) scale . at the final stage of the spectral data reduction ,",
    "the dual polarization data were concatenated to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "subsequently we made a total integrated intensity map with an effective resolution of @xmath20 from smoothed velocity channel maps by a gaussian function with @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , we performed deep single - point integrations towards the approximate center positions of 9 cores on the basis of preliminary nh@xmath0 maps made during the mapping observations .",
    "these deep integrations were intended to obtain a better estimate of the intensity ratio of the ( 1,1 ) to ( 2,2 ) transition , and gave a 45 times lower noise level than that in the mapping observations .",
    "in this section , we present the total integrated intensity map of the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) emission , as well as the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) spectra obtained through the deep integrations .",
    "since the ( 2,2 ) emission was detected only towards the gf9 - 2 and -9 core centers , we do not present the map of the transition .",
    "figures [ fig : map ] and [ fig : eachmap ] show total integrated intensity maps of the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) emission for the whole filament and individual cores , respectively . here , we integrated the main group of the hyperfine ( hf ) emission ( wilson , bieging & downes 1978 ; uww80 ) between @xmath22 @xmath23 km  s@xmath16 and @xmath24 km  s@xmath16 . to find the velocity range , we made figure [ fig : vrange ] where we present the lsr - velocity ranges of the main hf groups for the 9 spectra ( figure [ fig : sp ] ) taken with the deep integrations ( section [ s : obs ] ) .",
    "the velocity range for each core is defined by the two lsr - velocities where the intensity of the main hf group drops to the 1.5@xmath25 level .",
    "all 9 spectra showed similar velocity ranges ; the most blue- and redshifted velocities are found to be @xmath22 @xmath26 km  s@xmath16 in core 9 and @xmath27 km  s@xmath16 in core 8 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : map ] clearly shows the presence of 7 dense cloud cores , labeled gf9 - 5 , 8 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , and 9 from the east to the west ; table [ tbl : cores ] summarizes the peak positions of the cores , together with the other names found in the literature .",
    "the peak of these cores exceeds our detection threshold of s / n @xmath28 6 , which means s / n@xmath293 for the 50% level contour with respect to the peak intensity .",
    "notice that each core is detected at only a few observing points as shown in figure [ fig : eachmap ] .",
    "figure [ fig : eachmap]f shows that the two core candidates gf9 - 6 and 10 have peak intensities of 3 @xmath30 s /",
    "n @xmath31 6 . they are probably real objects because they seem to contain iras sources within the 3@xmath25 level contours .",
    "the gf9 - 10 core may be a new detection , although we have to verify its presence by obtaining a better s / n .",
    "although the gf9 - 7 core candidate can be marginally recognized above the 3@xmath25 level in figure [ fig : eachmap]g , we clearly detected the ( 1,1 ) emission through the deep integration ( figure [ fig : sp]g ) .",
    "the gf9 - 2 , 3 , and 4 cores were detected in nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) with the haystack 37 m telescope ( @xmath12 @xmath32 ; bm89 ) and were designated as l1082c , a , and b , respectively .",
    "the gf9 - 8 core is also seen in figure 33 of bm89 , but these authors have not given the core an identification number . the gf9 - 8 core has not been observed in nh@xmath0 mapping with the effelsberg 100 m telescope ( @xmath12 @xmath28 ; wiesemeyer 1997 ) .",
    "it is interesting that the gf9 - 5 and 8 cores as well as the gf9 - 7 core candidate do not exhibit yso activity , suggestive of starless cores .",
    "no dense core was detected towards the `` embedded yso '' of lm349 ( lm99 ) , while the two `` embedded ysos '' of lm350 and 351 are associated with the nh@xmath0 cores . here",
    ", an `` embedded yso '' is far - infrared bright yso selected from the _ iras _ point source catalog ( see lm99 for defintion ) .",
    "the relationship between the remaining `` embedded yso '' of lm352 and the gf9 - 4 core is not clear ( see figure [ fig : eachmap]d ) .",
    "the absence of an nh@xmath0 core around lm349 implies that the `` embedded yso '' may be a very low - mass object whose core mass is too small to be detected by our mapping survey .",
    "we also point out that lm349 is close to one of the local peaks in the @xmath33co ( 10 ) column density map of ciardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ; see also figure 1 of poidevin & bastien 2006 ) .    it is worth noting that the iras sources located in the gf9 - 3 and -4 cores are driving weak molecular outflows with momentum rates of , @xmath34  km  s@xmath16 yr@xmath16 ( bontemps et al .",
    "1996 ) , approximately along the north - south direction .",
    "last , it is likely that the number density of the cores tends to become high towards the east , while low to the west .",
    "in fact , the four cores in the eastern part of the filament , gf9 - 3 , 4 , 5 , and 8 seem to be confined to a rather small region of @xmath350.8pc . since the mean separation between the two neighboring cores is 0.36 pc , they can be treated as a group of cores .",
    "similarly , we consider the gf9 - 6 and -10 core candidates as another group . here , the separations are calculated using the peak positions in table [ tbl : cores ] . consequently , the two core groups , the isolated gf9 - 2 , 1 , and 9 cores , and the candidate core gf9 - 7 are located at regular intervals of @xmath350.9pc .",
    "figure [ fig : sp ] presents the 9 spectra of the nh@xmath0 @xmath36 and ( 2,2 ) rotation inversion lines obtained by the deep integrations ( section [ s : obs ] ) .",
    "all the observed positions showed the intense ( 1,1 ) emission with the distinct five groups of the hf components , except for gf9 - 7 , where the inner satellite hf groups at @xmath22 @xmath35 + 6 km  s@xmath16 and @xmath37 km  s@xmath16 are barely recognized .",
    "notice that the nh@xmath0 spectra for the core candidates gf9 - 6 and 7 were not taken towards the exact peak positions of the cores ( see figure [ fig : eachmap]f and g ) .",
    "in contrast to the ( 1,1 ) lines , sole the main hf group of the ( 2,2 ) transition was detected towards only gf9 - 2 and -9 with s / n @xmath293 . given the attained s / n in our observations , non - detection of the satellite ( 2,2 ) hf groups does not give a stringent limit in the optical depth , namely , @xmath38 since the intrinsic ratio of the main to satellite groups is about 15.9 for the ( 2,2 ) transition ( wilson et al . 1978 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the ( 2,2 ) lines are optically thin because the observed is considerably lower than the excitation temperature of the ( 1,1 ) transition , ( 1,1 ) ( 7.4  9.5k ; described in section [ ss : ncol ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to accurately know how each core is extended because our survey observations have been conducted with full - beam sampling .",
    "we therefore limit our analysis to the peak spectra which have sufficient s / n , instead of making source - averaged spectra . to calculate beam - averaged nh@xmath0 column densities ( ) , we employed hyperfine structure ( hfs ) analysis , which gives the total optical depth ( @xmath39 ) , the velocity width ( ) , and the lsr - velocity of one of the hf components ( @xmath40 ) . here , is the fwhm of a single hf component and is assumed to be identical for all the hf components , and @xmath39 is defined by the sum of the optical depths of all the hf components .",
    "the is subsequently deconvolved with the instrumental velocity resolution ( section [ s : obs ] ) to estimate an intrinsic velocity width ( ) .",
    "it should be noted that is free from velocity width increase caused by high optical depth because our hfs analysis solves and @xmath39 at the same time .",
    "we followed the procedure used in paper i ; our analysis is essentially equivalent to that summarized in stutzki & winnewisser ( 1985 ) and other papers of , e.g. , winnewisser , churchwell & walmsley ( 1979 ) , uww80 , pauls et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , and ungerechts , winnewisser & walmsley ( 1986 ) .",
    "first , we fitted one gaussian profile to the main hf group of the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) spectra .",
    "table [ tbl : sp ] summarizes the obtained peak temperatures in , which are used to calculate the rotational temperature between the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) levels ( ) in the third step .",
    "second , we performed the hfs analysis of the ( 1,1 ) spectra .",
    "the resultant parameters of @xmath40 , , and @xmath39 are summarized in table [ tbl : sp ] ; these @xmath40 values are plotted in figure [ fig : vrange ] as well .",
    "third , using eq.(4 ) of ho & towns ( 1983 ) , we calculated with the above peak values for both the transitions and @xmath39 .",
    "to use the equation , we gave the mean optical depth of the ( 1,1 ) line by @xmath39/18 , where the denominator of 18 is the number of ( 1,1 ) hf components ( e.g. , uww80 ) .",
    "for the 7 cores where the ( 2,2 ) transition was not detected , we adopted the 3@xmath25 upper limit as a peak .",
    "table [ tbl : sp ] shows that was calculated to be 7.4@xmath140.3k for gf9 - 2 and 7.9@xmath140.4k for gf9 - 9 , while the other cores have upper limits ranging between 7.1k and 12.8k .",
    "fourth , given @xmath39 , , and excitation temperature ( ) , we calculated the beam - averaged column density of nh@xmath0 molecules in the ( 1,1 ) level , @xmath41 , leading to with the value .",
    "for this purpose , we used eq.(2 ) in uww80 .",
    "we assumed that all the energy levels are in lte at temperature , and that is equal to as well as the gas kinetic temperature ( ) of the core , i.e. , @xmath28 @xmath28 .",
    "the cores are dense ( @xmath42 @xmath43 ) enough to make our assumption valid ( stutzki & winnewisser 1985 ; taffala et al .",
    "we believe that this assumption is reasonable because the derived agrees well with of c@xmath44o ( 10 ) ( 78k for gf9 - 2 , 3 , and 4 ; myers , linke & benson 1983 ) , @xmath33co ( 10 ) ( 7.2k for gf9 - 2 ; ciardi et al .",
    "2000 ) , and n@xmath17h@xmath45  ( 10 ) ( 9.5k ; paper i ) .",
    "we consequently obtained the nh@xmath0 column densities as summarized in table [ tbl : property ] . here , we exclude the candidate cores no.6 , 7 , and 10 with insufficient s / n .",
    "we found that the error in @xmath39 and the possible uncertainty in of 7.4  9.5k caused uncertainties in @xmath41 ranging from @xmath46 ( gf9 - 2 ) to 33% ( gf9 - 5 ) .",
    "last , we verified whether or not the above results towards the gf9 - 2 core are consistent with those obtained from the spectra with coarse velocity resolution in paper i ( see the core center portions of tables 5 and 6 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the optical depth given in table 5 of paper i is that for the most intense hf component , which can be converted into @xmath39 of 6.8@xmath140.4 and the value does not significantly differ from the new value of 8.0@xmath140.2 in this work .",
    "the high velocity resolution in this study gives @xmath47 times narrower than that in the previous work .",
    "the most significant difference between the two studies is that the new observations have succeeded in detecting the ( 2,2 ) transition , leading to the low values . in other words ,",
    "the cold temperature is the main cause of the higher @xmath48(nh@xmath0 ) , by a factor of @xmath353 compared with paper i.      once the beam - averaged has been obtained , one can calculate the lte - mass , , within the beam by supplying the fractional abundance of nh@xmath0 molecules , @xmath49(nh@xmath0 ) .",
    "we assumed that @xmath49(nh@xmath0 ) @xmath28 , estimated in gf9 - 2 ( paper i ) , is valid for the other cores .",
    "notice that , as addressed in paper i , the adopted abundance has reasonable agreement with those in similar objects ( jijina , myers & adams 1999 ) .",
    "the resultant  ranges from 1.8  ( gf9 - 5 ) to 8.2  ( gf9 - 2 ) ( table [ tbl : property ] ) .",
    "although the lte - mass for gf9 - 2 seems to be twice the previous estimate of 4.5@xmath142.4 , the two measurements can be reconciled considering the @xmath3550% uncertainty in @xmath49(nh@xmath0 ) and the difference between the adopted core sizes ( 5.5@xmath50 pc@xmath51 in paper i , versus 3.9@xmath50 pc@xmath51 in this work ) .",
    "notice that the @xmath3550% uncertainty in @xmath49(nh@xmath0 ) causes a significantly larger error in than those from the uncertainties in @xmath39 and described in the previous subsection .      in table",
    "[ tbl : sp ] , we summarize the values obtained through the hfs analysis . clearly , the observed intrinsic velocity widths in all the cores are 23 times larger than of 0.16  0.18 km  s@xmath16 for the range of 7.4  9.5 k [ @xmath52 .",
    "this fact indicates that the internal motions of all the cores are dominated by non - thermal pressure ( ) , such as supersonic turbulence .",
    "assuming that the non - thermal motions as well as the thermal ones support the cores against their self - gravity , we calculated virial masses ( ; see table [ tbl : property ] ) using in table [ tbl : sp ] . in section [ ss :",
    "virial ] , we compare with   in the context of the dynamical instability of the cores .",
    "it is probable that all the cores in the gf9 filament are gravitationally unstable because  @xmath31 ( table [ tbl : property ] ) if we interpret that the non - thermal velocity widths are due to the supersonic turbulence within the cores . here ,",
    "another distance estimate of 440pc ( section [ s : intro ] ) does not alter the relationship of  @xmath31 because  is proportional to @xmath10 while varies with @xmath53 . to verify the interpretation",
    ", we should assess origin of the non - thermal widths , as done in ciardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and paper i. in addition to the turbulent motions , it is well known that spectral line profiles can be broadened beyond their thermal widths owing to systematic motions of gas such as stellar winds or / and infall .",
    "however , it is unlikely that arises primarily from supersonic stellar winds or outflows because , to our knowledge , the nh@xmath0 inversion lines do not trace molecular outflows , but static dense gas .",
    "we suggest that the non - thermal velocity widths of the cores are produced by the large - scale infall motions rather than the turbulent ones .",
    "in fact , we discussed the presence of the supersonic infalling motions all over the gf9 - 2 core in paper i. our recent follow - up observations have clearly detected blue - skewed profiles in the optically thick hco@xmath45 ( 32 ) and ( 10 ) lines over the gf9 - 2 core ( r. s. furuya et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "moreover , we have detected such blue - skewed profiles towards the peak positions of the gf9 - 4 , 8 , and 9 cores with the ( 32 ) transition .",
    "these facts reinforce the idea that the internal motions of the cores in the gf9 filament are dominated by the large - scale supersonic infalling motions , although we have to assess the presence of the infall in all the cores through mapping observations .",
    "if this interpretation is valid for all the cores ,  should be calculated solely with the thermal width , i.e. , @xmath54 , yielding 0.19  0.25  for the range of 7.4  9.5k .",
    "this estimate suggests that most of the cores should be gravitationally unstable because @xmath31 in spite of the @xmath55 uncertainty in .",
    "a gravitational fragmentation process can explain why the dense cores in the gf9 filament are located at regular intervals of @xmath350.9pc ( see figure [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "recall that we consider the gf9 - 5 , 8 , 4 , and 3 cores , as well as the gf 9 - 6 and 10 core candidates , as groups ( @xmath56 .",
    "for simplicity , we compare the core separation with an expected jeans length ( @xmath57 ) for the filament .",
    "ciardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimated a density of @xmath58200 @xmath43 for the gf9 filament from their @xmath33co ( 10 ) observations . assuming that the ambient gas has a typical density of @xmath59 @xmath43 , @xmath57 is computed to be @xmath350.6pc at @xmath28 10k .",
    "this estimate is not significantly different from the core separation of @xmath350.9 pc . here",
    ", the temperature of 10k is taken from the typical peak ( 67k ) of the optically thick @xmath60co ( 32 ) and ( 10 ) emission derived in the ambient gas around the gf9 - 2 core ( paper i ) .",
    "in addition , the jeans mass for @xmath28 10k and @xmath61 @xmath43 is calculated to be @xmath62  which is comparable to the core lte - masses ( table [ tbl : property ] ) .",
    "such an estimate based on the `` classical '' jeans analysis implies that the fragmentation of the filament has been caused by the gravitational instability .",
    "alternatively , the spatial distribution of the identified cores might be understood in terms of the magnetohydrodynamical instability of the gf9 filamentary cloud , as hanawa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) proposed for interpreting the ongoing fragmentation process in the orion a filamentary cloud .",
    "they discussed that the effective sound velocity increases when the effect of magnetic field and/or rotation is considered [ see their eq.(11 ) ] , and that the jeans length of the filament becomes as short as the core separation unless the filament is almost perpendicular to the plane - of - sky .",
    "the apparent configuration of the gf9 filament would be somewhat similar to that of the orion cloud . however , to make such a comparison , we need to know not only basic parameters characterizing the filament such as length , width , inclination angle , and total mass , but also magnetic field strength and/or velocity field .",
    "using the nobeyama 45 m telescope , we carried out an unbiased survey of dense molecular cores in the gf9 filament .",
    "the obtained large - scale map of the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) emission revealed that the filament contains 7 dense ( @xmath63 @xmath43 ) and cold ( @xmath3 10k ) cores having the lte - masses of 1.8  8.2  and the three candidates located at the regular intervals of @xmath2pc .",
    "we argued that these cores appear to be gravitationally unstable and have formed through the gravitational fragmentation of the natal filamentary cloud .",
    "further high - resolution imaging of the identified cores , as well as a search for blue - skewed infall profiles over the cores will allow us to discuss the physical properties of the cores on a more solid ground .",
    "we lastly point out that good knowledge of the velocity field of the low - density inter - core gas traced by , e.g. , the @xmath33co ( 10 ) line will provide us with an essential clue towards understanding the formation mechanism of star forming cores in a filamentary cloud .",
