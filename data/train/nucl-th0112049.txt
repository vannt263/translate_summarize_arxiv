    "isotopic effects in nuclear reactions are receiving increasing attention because of their relation with the symmetry energy in the nuclear equation of state whose density dependence is of high current interest , in particular also for astrophysical applications @xcite . in a series of recent papers ,",
    "the scaling properties of cross sections for fragment production with respect to the isotopic composition of the emitting systems were investigated by tsang et al . @xcite .",
    "the studied reactions include symmetric heavy - ion reactions at intermediate energy leading to multifragment - emissions as well as asymmetric reactions induced by @xmath0 particles and @xmath5o projectiles at low to intermediate energies with fragment emission from excited heavy residues .",
    "the common behavior observed for these reactions , termed isoscaling , concerns the production ratios @xmath6 for fragments with neutron number @xmath7 and proton number @xmath8 in reactions with different isospin asymmetry .",
    "it is constituted by their exponential dependence on @xmath7 and @xmath8 according to @xmath9 with three parameters c , @xmath0 and @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the yields from the more neutron rich and the more neutron poor reaction system , respectively .    in some of the reactions ,",
    "the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath10 have the tendency to be quite similar in absolute magnitude but of opposite sign . for multifragmentation following central collisions of @xmath2sn + @xmath2sn and @xmath1sn + @xmath1sn at 50 mev per nucleon",
    ", @xmath0 = 0.37 and @xmath10 = -0.40 was obtained from fits to the fragment yield ratios in the mass range @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these parameters suggest an approximate scaling with the third component of the isospin @xmath3 of the form @xmath14 which follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalab ] ) since @xmath15 .",
    "the isotopic scaling of this latter kind has first been reported for reactions of protons of 660  mev energy incident on targets of @xmath16sn @xcite and subsequently also for other reactions with proton and deuteron projectiles in the relativistic regime of bombarding energies @xcite . with the notation chosen in these early papers , @xmath17 parameter values in the range @xmath18",
    "were obtained for the reactions with p(6.7 gev ) and d(3.1 gev ) projectiles @xcite .",
    "this is rather close to twice the value of @xmath0 for the symmetric sn + sn reactions @xcite and , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalt3 ] ) , suggests a very similar scaling behavior for fragmentation reactions induced by relativistic light ions .    in this paper",
    ", we will discuss the isotopic effects observed by bogatin et al . for reactions induced by protons , deuterons , and @xmath0 particles of incident energies between 660  mev and 15.3  gev on @xmath16sn targets @xcite .",
    "particular emphasis will be given to their scaling properties , with the aim to incorporate the light - ion induced fragmentation into the set of reactions investigated by tsang et al .",
    "@xcite . a complete set of references to these data and a statistical analysis performed with the quantum statistical model ( qsm ) of hahn and stcker @xcite can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will , furthermore , present isotopic temperatures derived from double ratios of helium and lithium isotopes for these reactions and compare their dependence on the incident energy with that of the scaling parameters .",
    "temperature measurements , in principle , also permit a test whether the reaction scenario , and specifically the temperature as an important parameter characterizing it , are indeed independent of the isotopic composition of the system as commonly assumed . for isotope temperatures , however , this property is already implied if isoscaling holds .",
    "it is a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalab ] ) according to which the double yield ratios from which isotope temperatures are derived are identical for the pair of reactions .",
    "the observations of approximately identical isotope temperatures in the @xmath1sn + @xmath1sn and @xmath2sn + @xmath2sn reactions at 50 mev per nucleon @xcite , as well as for the present reactions , are therefore part of the more general phenomenon of isoscaling .",
    "it has been shown that in both , light - ion induced collisions and peripheral heavy - ion collisions at high energy , the fragment production and observed isotopic effects can be explained in the framework of a hybrid approach consisting of a dynamical initial stage and a subsequent statistical breakup of a highly excited residual at low density @xcite . with the aim to identify reasons for the isotopic scaling in the present case , an analysis with the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm , ref .",
    "@xcite ) was carried out .",
    "it will be demonstrated that isotopic scaling arises naturally in a statistical fragmentation mechanism .",
    "the isoscaling parameter @xmath0 deduced for hot primary fragments is , furthermore , found to be directly proportional to the symmetry part of the binding energy of the fragments when they are formed at low density . to the extent that the modification of this parameter during secondary deexcitation remains small this opens the possibility of testing components of the nuclear equation of state in fragmentation reactions .",
    "the experimental data are taken from the literature @xcite .",
    "they were obtained in the jinr laboratories in dubna with beams of protons of 660  mev , 1.0 and 6.7  gev , of deuterons with 3.1  gev , and of @xmath0 particles with 15.3  gev incident energy .",
    "isotopically resolved cross sections of light fragments were measured with semiconductor telescopes placed at @xmath19 and with thin internal targets made from enriched @xmath1sn ( @xmath20 81% ) and @xmath2sn ( @xmath20 96% ) . from the yields , integrated over energy intervals specified in refs .",
    "@xcite , ratios @xmath21 for the production of a particular fragment in the reactions with the two sn isotopes were determined .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a reduced isotopic effect for a fragment species x by normalizing with respect to the ratio observed for @xmath22li , i.e. @xmath23 . uncertainties of the absolute normalizations of the data sets measured with the two targets are thus eliminated .",
    "= 9.0 cm    the reduced isotopic effects measured for the five pairs of reactions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the cross section ratios for the most neutron poor and the most neutron rich fragments differ by about one order of magnitude in all cases except for the d(3.1 gev ) reaction for which only a narrow range of isospin is covered by the detected products .",
    "a nearly perfect exponential dependence on the third component @xmath24 of the fragment isospin is observed , with slope parameters @xmath25 ( eq .  ( [ eq : scalboga ] ) )",
    "that decrease gradually from 1.08 to 0.68 as the projectile energy increases ( table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "this variation of the isotopic effect with the incident energy has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite and tentatively ascribed to a gradual rise of the temperatures of the emitting systems .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] parameters obtained from fitting the measured isotopic yield ratios with the scaling functions given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : scalab ] ) and ( [ eq : scalboga ] ) .",
    "the second column gives the range of fragment @xmath8 over which the data sets extend . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     according to the calculations , the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath0 are reduced to , on average , 77% of their values by the secondary decay ( table  [ tab : table3 ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath10 is more strongly reduced to about 60% of its value at 2  amev and to about 70% at 8  amev . however , since the coefficients are decreasing with the energy , the absolute magnitude of this reduction decreases also . moreover",
    ", additional calculations showed that the secondary - decay effect decreases considerably if the coefficients themselves become smaller , e.g. , a primary @xmath26 0.46 is reduced to @xmath20 0.44 . in this respect , we confirm the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the minute variation of the @xmath0 parameter , but provided that the value of the initial @xmath0 is relatively small .",
    "the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite were done for @xmath27 = 6  mev with several statistical models , including other versions of the smm . in some of these calculations ,",
    "the decay procedure is based on a sequential emission of particles from primary fragments , following the tabulated branching ratios and a weisskopf scheme .",
    "this seems adequate for a later deexcitation stage with isolated fragments at relatively low excitation energy and without the influence of a common coulomb field and without a residual nuclear interaction which can modify fragment properties including the branchings .",
    "the obtained modifications of the scaling parameter @xmath0 do not exceed the order of 5% whereas @xmath10 is reduced more strongly , similar to the present case .",
    "the primary values of the scaling parameter @xmath26 0.4 to 0.45 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath16sn systems are smaller than the corresponding values given in table  [ tab : table3 ] .",
    "this , apparently , reflects significant differences between different versions and parameterizations of , in principle , the same model .",
    "they are of the same order as potential effects of the symmetry term that are to be studied .",
    "this emphasizes the need for exclusive analyses of experimental data which should constrain the model parameters .",
    "the two secondary deexcitation procedures should be considered as partly complementary , and the range of the differences of the obtained results may characterize the reliability of treating secondary decays with model calculations .",
    "these corrections are essential @xcite , but it will be important to reduce the uncertainties .",
    "experimental methods , e.g. based on correlation techniques @xcite , may prove very useful for this purpose .",
    "the deduced relations will now be used for the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "we will concentrate on the two reactions initiated by the projectiles with the highest energies , protons of 6.7 gev and @xmath0 particles of 15.3 gev , for which the contributions from instantaneous breakups into multifragment channels should be enhanced in comparison to the other cases .",
    "the inclusive nature of the measurements , nevertheless , presents an inherent difficulty since a wide range of excitation energies is covered by the fragment emitting sources .",
    "the @xmath16sn targets used in these experiments were isotopically enriched to 81.7% and 96.6% , respectively @xcite .",
    "the effects of the impurities , known to be distributed approximately as the natural abundances of tin isotopes , have to be taken into account in a quantitative analysis .",
    "corrections were estimated by assuming gaussian mass distributions for the produced fragments , centered around mean values that vary linearly with the mass number of the considered tin isotopes .",
    "it was found that , for the specific enrichments of the used targets and for scaling coefficients @xmath0 in the range 0.3 to 0.6 , the impurities cause a reduction of the measured @xmath0 by 10% to 15% .",
    "the analytical expressions for the differences of the chemical potentials , derived in the grand - canonical approximation ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dmunu ] ) ) , depend only on @xmath28 and the isotopic composition of the sources . in the case of @xmath29 , the difference of the squared @xmath30 values",
    "is required which is found to be the same within a few percent , independently of whether it is evaluated for the original targets @xmath16sn or for the excited systems as predicted by the inc calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , section  [ sec : dynam ] ) . for the original targets it amounts to @xmath31 = 0.0367 , leading to @xmath32 . to obtain an experimental value of @xmath33 ( section  [ sec : grand ] ) , the mean values of the scaling coefficient @xmath0 and of the isotope temperature @xmath34 for the p(6.7 gev ) and @xmath0(15.3 gev ) reactions are used , after applying corrections . a measured @xmath35 = 0.365",
    "is obtained from table  [ tab : table1 ] , corresponding to 0.417 for isotopically pure targets , and the effect of the secondary deexcitation is assumed to be 23% , as suggested by the markov - chain calculations ( table  [ tab : table3 ] ) , thus leading to a primary @xmath0 = 0.542 .",
    "the predictions of the qsm @xcite are used for the correction of the temperature .",
    "it does not significantly depend on the assumed density but it is large , as expected .",
    "the mean apparent temperature @xmath36 = 4.35 mev ( table  [ tab : table2 ] ) corresponds to a breakup temperature @xmath37 = 6.2 mev in this model .",
    "the results obtained with these inputs are @xmath29  =  3.36 mev and @xmath28 = 22.8 mev , a symmetry coefficient slightly but not significantly smaller than the adopted standard value of 25 mev .    for the interpretation of the isoscaling coefficient in the microcanonical limit the excitation energy needs to be specified .",
    "exclusive data for hadron induced reactions on au targets indicate that fragments will be emitted if energies exceeding @xmath20 400 mev , corresponding to @xmath38 2 mev , are deposited by the projectile @xcite . since the cross sections decrease and the fragment emission probabilities increase with excitation energy , a rather wide distribution results .",
    "for the @xmath39 projectiles of 8 gev / c studied by the isis collaboration this distribution extends from below 3 to above 8 mev per nucleon with a weighted mean value of @xmath38 5 mev @xcite . a similar or ,",
    "because of the lighter targets , a slightly higher value may be expected for the case of protons of 6.7 gev on @xmath16sn .",
    "the inc calculations for this reaction , again weighted by the fragment production cross section , predict an average excitation energy @xmath27 = 6.2 mev . with this interval 5.0 mev to 6.2 mev per nucleon for the excitation energy , and with the assumption that @xmath40 as in the grand - canonical approximation , values between @xmath28 = 21.4 mev and 22.6 mev are obtained from the comparison of the measured @xmath0 = 0.39 ( @xmath0 = 0.45 for pure targets ) with the predictions given in table  [ tab : table3 ] for which the standard value @xmath28 = 25 mev was used . if @xmath41",
    "=  8  mev is considered as realistic for @xmath0(15.3 gev ) a similar symmetry coefficient @xmath28 = 21.6 mev will result .",
    "towards the lower projectile energies , the isoscaling coefficient @xmath0 increases up to 0.53 , corresponding to 0.61 for pure targets , which is still lower than the smm predictions for small excitation energies ( table  [ tab : table3 ] ) . with the inc result @xmath41 = 2.7 mev for protons of 660 mev , the interpolated prediction is @xmath0 = 0.65 , and @xmath28 = 23.3 mev is obtained from the comparison with the measured value .",
    "it thus seems that , for the reactions studied here , the deduced values of @xmath28 fall consistently into the range of 21 to about 23 mev , with no significant dependence on the energy . in this respect",
    ", however , it has to be considered that the constraint of energy conservation in the microcanonical calculations may lead to unrealistically narrow widths of the isotope distributions at low excitation energies .",
    "this would cause an overprediction of the scaling coefficients and a deduced @xmath28 that is too low .",
    "this effect will bring @xmath28 even closer to the standard value for the reactions at lower incident energies which primarily proceed via the formation of excited compound nuclei .",
    "in the first part of this paper , the existence of isoscaling for reactions induced by relativistic light particles was demonstrated .",
    "the deduced exponents vary smoothly with the incident energy .",
    "their trends , apparently , extend beyond the range studied here to low - energy projectiles as , e.g. , @xmath0 particles of 200 mev for which isoscaling parameters were reported in ref .",
    "the values obtained for protons of 6.7 gev and @xmath0 projectiles of 15.3 gev are close to those for central @xmath16sn + @xmath16sn reactions at 50 mev per nucleon given in the same reference .",
    "the observation of @xmath24 scaling was illustrated and discussed . as a function of the projectile energy , a very similar variation of the inverse scaling parameters and of the isotope temperature @xmath42",
    "was observed .    in the second part , a statistical formalism for the interpretation of the isoscaling phenomenon was developed .",
    "analytical expressions were derived in the grand - canonical approximation and their validity and applicability illustrated .",
    "results of calculations in the grand - canonical approximation and with the microcanonical markov - chain version of the smm were presented and the connection with the symmetry term of the fragment binding energy was established .",
    "it was found that the difference of the chemical potentials for the two isotopically different systems does not depend on the temperature .",
    "for the markov - chain calculations , this conclusion is valid for temperatures @xmath43 5 mev , the range of relevance for multifragment processes .",
    "the invariance of @xmath29 with temperature is consistent with the interpretation that the observed variation of the scaling parameters is caused by a change in temperature , as suggested by the temperature measurement .    in the last part ( section  [ sec : inter ] )",
    ", an attempt was made to deduce values for the symmetry - energy coefficient @xmath28 from the experimental data .",
    "the analytical formulae derived in the grand - canonical limit of the smm and the results of the microcanonical calculations were used and very similar values in the range @xmath44 mev were obtained .",
    "besides the scaling coefficient , experimental values for either the breakup temperature in the grand - canonical or for the excitation energy in the microcanonical approach were required . in the latter case , estimates obtained for similar reactions and from inc calculations were used .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties of the methods , in particular the errors associated with the determinations of the breakup temperature or of the excitation energy for the microcanonical method , to be at least of the same order as the deviations of the results from the standard value @xmath28 = 25 mev .",
    "the sequential decay corrections are substantial and , e.g. , in the grand - canonical case are required twice , for the scaling coefficient and for the temperature .",
    "the present results , therefore , do not contradict the assumptions made in the statistical multifragmentation model in using standard liquid - drop parameters for describing the nascent fragments at the breakup stage .",
    "a problem associated with the present data is the wide range of excitation energies over which an average is taken in the inclusive measurements .",
    "smaller variations may be smeared out . for these reasons , the presented analysis is primarily intended to serve as an example of how to extract the symmetry - energy coefficient @xmath28 from the experimental data .",
    "it is , nevertheless , of interest that the obtained result for fragmentation reactions induced by relativistic light projectiles has a tendency to be smaller than the conventional value of 25 mev .",
    "a reduction with increasing energy may even be suggested by the microcanonical analysis . provided",
    "it can be substantiated by other data and analyses , this would indicate that the symmetry part of the fragment binding energy is slightly weaker than that of isolated nuclei .",
    "fragments , as they are formed at breakup , may have a lower than normal density .",
    "such effects may be enhanced as the energy deposited in the fragmenting system is increased .",
    "therefore , exclusive studies with possibly heavier projectiles will be required to more clearly identify potential variations of the symmetry energy with the reaction parameters .    stimulating discussions with l. andronenko , m. andronenko , s.  dasgupta , w.g .",

    "<S> isotopic effects observed in fragmentation reactions induced by protons , deuterons , and @xmath0 particles of incident energies between 660  mev and 15.3  gev on @xmath1sn and @xmath2sn targets are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential scaling of the yield ratios with the third component of the fragment isospin @xmath3 is observed in all reactions , with scaling parameters that depend on the incident energy . </S>",
    "<S> breakup temperatures for these reactions are deduced from double ratios of isotopic yields and tested for their relation with the isoscaling parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum statistical ( qsm ) and the statistical multifragmentation ( smm ) models are used for interpreting the results . </S>",
    "<S> the observed isoscaling can be understood as a consequence of a statistical origin of the emitted fragments in these reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the smm analysis shows that the exponent describing the isoscaling behavior is proportional to the strength of the symmetry term of the fragment binding energy . using this result , </S>",
    "<S> a symmetry - term coefficient @xmath4 22.5 mev for fragments at breakup is deduced from the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this is close to the standard value and supports smm assumptions for the breakup configuration . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative method of determining the symmetry - energy coefficient , by using isotope distribution widths , is also discussed . </S>"
