    "uu  aquarii is a bright eclipsing novalike ( p@xmath1 hr ) showing long - term brightness variations of 0.3 mags @xcite .",
    "broad - band eclipse mapping indicate that its inner disc is optically thick , with an inferred mass accretion rate of m@xmath2 @xcite . it was suggested to be an sw sex star based on its relative flat radial temperature profile in the inner disc , single peaked asymmetric emission lines showing little eclipse , large phase shift between photometric and spectroscopic conjunction and orbital phase - dependent absorption in the balmer lines @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report on the analysis of time - resolved spectroscopy of uu aqr with eclipse mapping techniques @xcite to derive spatially - resolved spectra of the accretion flow in this binary .",
    "time - resolved optical spectroscopy ( @xmath3 35006900  ) covering 5 eclipses of uu  aqr was obtained with the 2.1-m telescope at kpno on july - august 1993 at a time resolution of 50s .",
    "the observations were performed while uu aqr was on its high brightness state .",
    "the spectra were divided into 226 passbands ( 15   in the continuum and fainter lines , and @xmath4 across the most prominent lines ) and light curves were extracted for each passband .",
    "average lightcurves for each passband were obtained by combining the 5 individual lightcurves .",
    "the eclipse mapping method was used to obtain a map of the disc brightness distribution and the flux of an additional uneclipsed component in each passband .",
    "the monochromatic maps were combined to produce spatially - resolved spectra .",
    "fig.1 shows spatially - resolved spectra of the disc region in a logarithmic scale .",
    "the lower panel shows the spectrum of the uneclipsed light .",
    "the spectrum of the inner disc is characterized by a blue and bright continuum filled with deep and narrow absorption lines .",
    "the continuum emission becomes progressively fainter and redder for increasing disc radius while the lines transition from absorption to emission showing clear p  cygni profiles on all lines mapped at higher spectral resolution .",
    "the balmer jump appears in absorption in the inner disc and weakly in emission in the intermediate and outer disc regions , suggesting that the outer disc in uu  aqr is optically thin .",
    "the change in the slope and intensity of the continuum with increasing disc radius reflects the temperature gradient in the accretion disc , with the effective temperature decreasing outwards .",
    "spatially resolved disc spectra are shown in fig.2 as a function of velocity for the h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 and h@xmath7 lines .",
    "the absorption lines at disc center are perceptibly narrower and deeper than expected for emission from either the white dwarf atmosphere or from disc gas in keplerian orbits around the white dwarf , and the lines show larger widths at the outer disc .",
    "this is in clear disagreement with the expected behaviour of line emission from gas in a keplerian disc and is an evidence that most of the line emission do not arise from the disc atmosphere . on the other hand ,",
    "the lines at intermediate and outer disc regions ( @xmath8 ) show clear p  cygni profiles indicating origin in an outflowing gas , probably the disc wind",
    ".    the spectrum of the uneclipsed light shows prominent balmer and hei emission lines ( fig.1 ) . the balmer jump ( and possibly also the paschen jump ) is clearly in emission indicating that the uneclipsed light has an important contribution from optically thin gas from outside the orbital plane .",
    "the fractional contribution of the uneclipsed light is very significant for the emission lines , reaching 40 - 60% at the balmer lines and 20 - 40% at the hei lines , and decreases steadily along the balmer serie .",
    "the difference in fractional contribution between the balmer and hei lines indicates the existence of a vertical temperature gradient in the material above / below the disc , with the hei lines ( which require higher excitation energies ) being produced closer to the orbital plane . in all case ,",
    "a substantial fraction of the light at these lines does not arise from the orbital plane and is not occulted during eclipse .",
    "fig.3 shows the ratio between the spectrum of the gas stream region and the disc region at same radius as a function of radius .",
    "the comparison reveals that the spectrum of the gas stream is noticeably different from the disc spectrum in the outer disc regions ( where one expects a bright spot to form due to the initial shock between the inflowing stream and the outer disc rim ) but is also different in the inner disc regions .",
    "this result suggests the existence of gas stream penetration in uu  aqr , which can be seen down to @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum of the ratio becomes redder for decreasing disc radius , possibly a combination of the disc emission becoming bluer as one moves inwards and the gas stream emission becoming redder while its energy is continuously lost in the shock with disc material along the inward stream trajectory ."
