    "various methods have been proposed to detect and characterize extrasolar planets , including radial velocity technique @xcite , transit method @xcite , direct imaging @xcite , pulsar timing analysis @xcite , and microlensing @xcite .",
    "see also the review of @xcite .",
    "the microlensing signal of a planetary companion to galactic disk and bulge microlens stars is the short - duration perturbation to the smooth standard light curve of the primary - induced lensing event occurred on background star .",
    "compared to other methods , the decay of the planetary lensing signal with the decrease of the planet / star mass ratio is relatively slow , and thus the microlensing technique has an important advantage of being applicable to the detections of earth - mass planets by using already existing instrument @xcite .",
    "the microlensing method also has a unique applicability to the detections of free - floating planets @xcite .",
    "in addition , the method is not restricted to planets of nearby stars and can be extended even to nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , two clear - cut microlensing detections of exoplanets were reported by @xcite and @xcite .    due to the rare and incidental chance of lensing events combined with the short duration of planet signals , planetary lensing searches require a special observational setup , where survey observations issue alerts of ongoing events in the early stage of lensing magnification @xcite and follow - up collaborations intensively monitor the alerted events @xcite . however",
    ", follow - up is generally done with small field - of - view instrument , and thus events are monitored sequentially . as a result",
    ", only a handful number of events can be followed at any given time , limiting the number of planet detections . to maximize the number of potential planet detections with a limited use of resources and time , @xcite proposed to focus on high - magnification events .",
    "they pointed out that high - magnification events have a dramatically higher chance of being perturbed by planets due to the existence of a ` central ' caustic ( see   2 for more detail ) . by adopting this proposal , current follow - up experiments are giving high priority to these events",
    ". however , little has been studied about the characteristics of central caustics and the perturbations induced by them ( central perturbations ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the properties of central caustics and the perturbations induced by them .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in   2 , we describe basic physics of planetary lensing . in   3 , we analytically investigate how the location , size , and shape of the central caustic vary depending on the mass ratio , @xmath1 , and separation , @xmath0 , of planets under the planetary perturbative approximation and compare the results with those based on numerical computations . in   4",
    ", we then systematically inspect the patterns of central perturbations by constructing maps of magnification excess for planets with various values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . from the constructed maps",
    ", we also examine the effect of finite source size and investigate the possible types of planets detectable for given source stars with various sizes .",
    "we summarize the results and conclude in   5 .",
    "the lensing mapping from the lens plane to the source plane of @xmath11-point masses with no external shear or convergence is described by the lens equation of @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the complex notations of the source , lens , and image positions , respectively , @xmath16 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the masses of the individual lens components , and @xmath19 is the total mass of the lens system @xcite . here",
    "all angles are normalized to the einstein ring radius @xmath20 of the total mass of the system , i.e , @xmath21^{1/2 } , \\label{eq2.2}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively . for a single lens @xmath24 ,",
    "there exist two images with locations at @xmath25 $ ] and magnifications of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the separation between the lens and source .",
    "then , the total magnification corresponds to the sum of the magnifications of the individual images and it is related to @xmath28 by @xmath29    a planetary lensing is described by the formalism of a binary ( @xmath30 ) lens with a very low - mass companion . for a binary lens ,",
    "there are three or five images and the number of images changes by two as the source crosses a caustic .",
    "the caustics are important features of binary lensing and they represent the set of source positions at which the magnification of a point source becomes infinite .",
    "the caustics of binary lensing form a single or multiple closed figures where each figure is composed of concave curves ( fold caustics ) that meet at cusps . for a planetary case ,",
    "there exist two sets of disconnected caustics : one ` central caustic ' located close to the host star and one or two ` planetary caustics ' depending on whether the planet lies outside or inside the einstein ring . since the central caustic lies close to the host star , the perturbation induced by the central caustic occurs close to the peak of lensing light curves of high - magnification events . for a star - planet system",
    ", it is known that the lensing behavior can be described by the perturbation approach due to the small planet / star mass ratio @xcite . in this case , the lensing equation is expressed as @xmath31 where the position of the star is chosen as the coordinate origin and @xmath32 represents the location of the planet .",
    "under the planetary perturbative approximation ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , the location of the central caustic can be expressed in an analytic form of @xmath35 \\label{eq3.1}\\ ] ] @xcite , where the polar coordinates are centered at the position of the primary star and @xmath36 represents the polar angle ( see figure  [ fig : one ] ) . with the notation for the star - planet separation of @xmath37 ,",
    "the caustic position is expressed in an explicit form of @xmath38 @xmath39 the central caustic has an elongated asteroid shape with four cusps , where two of them are located on the star - planet axis and the other two are located off the axis .",
    "cusps of a central caustic occur when @xmath40 ( i.e. , when @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the on - axis cusps and when @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the off - axis cusps ) , and thus their locations are found to be @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 . \\label{eq3.6}\\ ] ] then , the horizontal and vertical widths of the central caustic defined as the separations between the on- and off - axis cusps ( see figure  [ fig : one ] ) are respectively @xmath48 @xmath49    in figure  [ fig : two ] , we present central caustics produced by planets with various separations and mass ratios . from the figure and equations ( [ eq3.1 ] )  ( [ eq3.8 ] ) , we find the following characteristics of the central caustic .    1 .   the size of the central caustic depends on both the separation and mass ratio .",
    "the dependence of the central - caustic size on the mass ratio is linear , i.e. , @xmath3 , as shown in equations  ( [ eq3.1 ] )  ( [ eq3.3 ] ) and demonstrated in the right panels of figure  [ fig : two ] . by comparison ,",
    "the size of the planetary caustic is proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that the central caustic shrinks much more rapidly with the decrease of the planet mass compared to the planetary caustic . if the caustic size is defined as the horizontal width , the size depends on the star - planet separation by @xmath51 .",
    "then , the caustic size becomes maximum when @xmath52 and decreases with the increase of @xmath53 . in the limiting cases of a very wide - separation planet ( @xmath54 ) and",
    "a close - in planet ( @xmath55 ) , the dependencies are respectively @xmath56 in figure  [ fig : three ] , we present the size of the central caustic as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   for a given mass ratio , a pair of central caustics with separations @xmath0 and @xmath8 are identical up to linear order .",
    "this can be seen from the pair of caustics with separations @xmath0 and @xmath8 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
    "analytically , this can also be proved from equations  ( [ eq3.1 ] )  ( [ eq3.3 ] ) where the inversion of @xmath10 result in the same expression .",
    "3 .   under the perturbative approximation ,",
    "the shape of the central caustic is solely dependent on the planet separation .",
    "we quantify the caustic shape as the vertical / horizontal width ratio , @xmath57 , and present the variation of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath0 in figure  [ fig : four ] . in the figure , we present two curves , where one is based on the perturbative approximation and the other is based on numerical computation .",
    "one finds that the width ratios based on the analytic and numerical computations match very well except the region around @xmath58 , where the perturbative approximation is not valid .",
    "we find that the difference in this region is caused by the merge of the planetary and central caustics . from its parent star",
    "is located at @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , as @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and thus the planetary caustic approaches the central caustic and eventually merge .",
    "] one also finds that the width ratio of the central caustic rapidly increases with the decrease of @xmath53 .",
    "knowing now the characteristic of central caustics , we then investigate the pattern of planetary perturbations induced by central caustics .",
    "for this purpose , we construct maps of magnification excess , which is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the exact magnification of the planetary lensing and @xmath64 is the single lensing magnification caused by the host star at its ` effective ' position . due to the additional deflection of light produced by the presence of the companion , it was known that the effective lensing position of a component of the binary lens system is shifted toward its companion @xcite .",
    "the amount of the shift of a lens component ` @xmath65 ' toward the other component ` @xmath66 ' is @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath18 are the masses of the individual lens components and @xmath69 is the einstein ring radius corresponding to @xmath68 @xcite . for a planetary lens case , the shift of the host star ( with a notation ` @xmath70 ' ) toward the planet ( with a notation ` @xmath71 ' )",
    "is expressed as @xmath72 because @xmath73 and @xmath74 . ' in equations  ( [ eq4.2 ] ) and ( [ eq4.3 ] ) was not included in the corresponding equations of @xcite and @xcite , where they treated only wide - separation binaries .",
    "we introduce this term to keep the symmetry between the central caustics of planets with separations @xmath0 and @xmath8 . ] then , as either @xmath75 ( wide - separation planet ) or @xmath76 ( close - in planet ) , the shift is @xmath77 , and thus the effective lensing position of the primary star approaches its original position .",
    "lccc main - sequence ( @xmath78 ) & o & o & x + turn - off ( @xmath79 ) & o & @xmath80 & x + clump - giant ( @xmath81 ) & o & x & x +    in figure  [ fig : five ]  [ fig : seven ] , we present the constructed magnification - excess maps for planets with various values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "planetary signal is important for planets with separations within the so called ` lensing zone ' of @xmath82 @xcite , and thus we plot maps for planets located within this range . to see the effect of finite - source size",
    ", we construct three sets of maps with source stars of main - sequence ( with a radius of @xmath83 ) , turn - off ( with @xmath84 ) , and clump giant ( with @xmath85 ) stars and they are presented in figure  [ fig : five ] , [ fig : six ] , and [ fig : seven ] , respectively .",
    "the magnification of a finite source with a surface brightness profile of @xmath86 is computed by the intensity - weighted magnification averaged over the source star surface , i.e. , @xmath87 where @xmath63 denotes the point - source magnification , @xmath88 is the vector position of the center of the source , @xmath89 is the displacement vector of a point on the source star surface with respect to the source star s center , and the two - dimensional integral is over the source - star surface @xmath90 .",
    "the effect of finite source size is smearing out the detailed structures of the planetary lensing signals .",
    "the finite - source effect is determined by the _",
    "normalized _ source radius @xmath91 , which represents the angular radius of a star , @xmath92 , in units of the einstein ring radius , i.e.   @xmath93 .",
    "we thus set @xmath91 of the individual stars by choosing an einstein radius of @xmath94 that corresponds to the value of the most frequent galactic bulge event with @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "then , the normalized source radius of a @xmath83 star corresponds to @xmath78 . for a source with uniform surface brightness , the computation can be reduced from a two - dimensional to a one - dimensional integral using the generalized stokes s theorem @xcite . to accelerate computations",
    ", we thus assume that the source stars have uniform surface brightness . however",
    ", we note that the effect of non - uniform surface brightness on the planetary lensing signal is not important . for a planetary system with a primary star of @xmath95 , the mass ratios of the jupiter- , saturn- , neptune- , and earth - mass planets correspond to @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , respectively .    from the excess maps , we find the following properties of central perturbations .    1 .",
    "first , we find that the effect of finite source size on central perturbations is much more severe than the effect on perturbations caused by planetary caustics .",
    "this is because the central caustic is not only much smaller but also shrinks much more rapidly with the decrease of @xmath1 than the planetary caustic . as a result",
    ", we find that although giant planets with @xmath6 can be detected from the planet search strategy of monitoring high - magnification events , detecting signals of earth - mass planets with @xmath7 would be very difficult .",
    "it is estimated that the lower mass limit of detectable planets will be that of a neptune - mass planet with @xmath102 , but detecting this mass - range planets will be possible only for events associated with source stars smaller than turn - off stars . in table",
    "[ table1 ] , we summarize the possible types of planets detectable from events involved with various types of source stars .",
    "2 .   second , as expected by the close similarity between the pair of caustics with separations @xmath0 and @xmath8 , the pattern of perturbations induced by these two caustics are similar each other .",
    "a good example is the pair of maps with @xmath103 and @xmath104 in figure  [ fig : five ] .",
    "however , we find that as the planet mass increases , the difference between the perturbation patterns of the pair of planets increases . we find that the difference is large enough to be noticed for planets with @xmath6 , c.f . , the pair of maps of the planets with @xmath105 and @xmath106 . considering that the majority of planets to be detected by the strategy of monitoring high - magnification events are giant planets",
    ", we predict that the @xmath107 degeneracy could be broken for a majority of planetary events from observations with a @xmath9 photometric precision .",
    "we investigated the properties of central caustics and the perturbations induced by them . under the planetary perturbative approximation , we derived analytic expressions of the location , size , and shape of the central caustic as a function of the planet separation and mass ratio and compared the results with those based on numerical computations . while it has been known that the size of the planetary caustic is proportional to @xmath50 , we found from this work that the dependence of the central - caustic size on the mass ratio is linear . as a result , the central caustic shrinks much more rapidly with the decrease of the planet mass compared to the planetary caustic .",
    "due to the large finite - source effect caused by the smaller size of the central caustic combined with much more rapid decrease of its size with the decrease of @xmath1 , we predict that although giant planets with @xmath6 can be detected from the planet search strategy of monitoring high - magnification events , detecting signals of earth - mass planets with @xmath7 would be very difficult . although the central caustics of a pair of planets with separations @xmath0 and @xmath8 are identical up to the linear order , we found that the difference between the magnification patterns induced by the pair of degenerate caustics of planets with @xmath6 can be noticed at the level of @xmath108 .",
    "because the majority of planets expected to be detected by the strategy of monitoring high - magnification events are giant planets , we predict that the @xmath10 degeneracy could be broken for a majority of planetary events from observations with good enough photometric precision .",
