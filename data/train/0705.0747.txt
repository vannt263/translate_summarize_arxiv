    "in light of the impressive agreement of all current cosmological observations with the paradigm of inflation and the generation of primordial perturbations from quantum fluctuations @xcite , every opportunity for finding signs of new physics in the data should be explored .",
    "simple phenomenological models for new high energy physics have recently been used in order to characterize deviations from the standard predictions .",
    "this is the general approach that we pursue here , analyzing an important physical effect that has so far been overlooked .",
    "standard inflationary spectra are governed by @xmath0 , the hubble scale during inflation , and its behavior as a function of the background energy - momentum content ( i.e. the inflaton potential in the simplest scenarios ) . on the other hand",
    ", deviations may depend on a second scale such as , for instance , the cutoff @xmath1 at which the standard low - energy theory breaks down . to preserve the leading behavior ,",
    "the new scale is taken to be much higher than other physical scales , i.e. , here @xmath2 .",
    "this line of thought was first applied to black hole radiation @xcite and then transposed to the cosmological context in @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "when considering backward in time propagation , the tremendous blueshift experienced by the mode frequency acts like a space - time microscope which brings the ( proper ) frequency across the new scale @xcite .",
    "however , the adiabatic evolution of the quantum state reduces the deviations of the outcoming spectra . in inflationary cosmology ,",
    "their amplitude is proportional to a positive power of @xmath3 , which makes their detection very challenging .    in the present paper",
    "we extend previous analysis by pointing out that it is unlikely that the @xmath4 scale @xmath1 be fixed with an infinite precision . on the contrary , it is possible that the gradual appearance of new physics effectively endows @xmath1 with a finite width .",
    "whether this width arises from quantum mechanics or from a classical stochastic process will be left unspecified in this work ; we will simply treat @xmath1 as a random ( gaussian ) variable and assume that its fluctuations are small with respect to the mean .",
    "as expected , the average over the fluctuations washes out all oscillatory corrections to the power spectra which depend on a rapidly varying phase .",
    "this is important because the leading corrections to the power spectrum from a high - energy cutoff found so far , see e.g. @xcite and references therein , are precisely functions of this type .    a similar damping mechanism was found in @xcite when considering the modifications of hawking radiation induced by metric fluctuations treated stochastically .",
    "furthermore , it was shown @xcite that the stochastic treatment emerges from a quantum mechanical analysis of gravitational loop corrections .",
    "this indicates that the phenomenology of blurring the @xmath4 scale is insensitive to the particular underlying mechanism .",
    "we will demonstrate , however , that it can in principle be distinguished from an adiabatic suppression since it only acts on the oscillatory corrections , whereas the latter also affects the slowly varying contributions .",
    "hence , it opens the door to investigate a new aspect of cutoff phenomenology with possible links to quantum gravity .",
    "other phenomenological signatures of a fluctuating geometry have been considered in @xcite .    to implement the notion of a fluctuating cutoff",
    ", we first use a phenomenological description in which each independent field mode of wave number @xmath5 is placed into an instantaneous vacuum state at the time its redshifted momentum crosses @xmath1 .",
    "depending on the adiabaticity of the state , the resulting modifications are more or less suppressed but the leading correction is _ always _ a rapidly oscillating function of @xmath1 ( and of @xmath5 in slow roll inflation ) .",
    "therefore , in this class of models , the effect of averaging over the fluctuations of @xmath1 damps the leading correction .",
    "the damping factor depends on the width of @xmath1 , but the crucial fact is that a tiny variance ( in units of the mean @xmath6 ) is enough to eradicate the oscillatory modifications of the power spectrum because their frequency is very high ( proportional to @xmath7 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : steady - non - steady ] we summarize the derivation of the power spectrum modifications and explain why they can be decomposed into a rapidly oscillating and a steady part . while this conclusion is reached for a particular class of models , in sec.[sec : gener - other - class ] we generalize it to a wider class of possible modifications of the power spectrum .",
    "the process of averaging over stochastic fluctuations of the cutoff is carried out in sec .",
    "[ sec : stochastic - averaging ] .",
    "we then point out that the uv - blurring shows some similarities with the averaging involved in computing the multipole coefficients of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies from the primordial spectrum .",
    "we compare these effects in sec.[sec : geometric - average ] and discuss our results in sec.[sec : discussion ] .",
    "we begin with a summary of the phenomenological description of trans - planckian signatures arising from the choice of the initial state of the modes of linear perturbations .",
    "the various elements are presented with the aim to highlight the origin and properties of the deviations from the standard power spectrum .",

    "what motivates our choice is the fact that standard physics is nearly scale invariant , in that the deviations of the power spectrum from scale invariance only come from the background geometry through logarithmic derivatives of @xmath27 .",

    "i.e. for @xmath204 , where @xmath29 is the size of the acoustic horizon ( in practice @xmath205 ) , one can use the following asymptotic expressions of the form factor @xmath206 in this case , as noticed in @xcite , the integral ( [ thecl ] ) actually performs a geometric average over the fine - structure of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "more precisely , for the power spectrum given by ( [ paramp ] ) , the oscillatory deviations are damped by a power of the frequency of superimposed oscillations @xmath207 while the steady correction is not .    in the limit ( [ itformfactors ] ) , the integral ( [ thecl ] ) can be done explicitly with the change of variables @xmath208 and with the help of @xmath209 applied for the values @xmath210 and @xmath211 for the steady and oscillatory corrections respectively .    to simplify the expressions we set @xmath212 in @xmath213 ( flat power spectrum ) . in this case , we find @xmath214 \\right .",

    "( [ paramp ] ) , @xmath216 and @xmath217 weigh the oscillatory and steady corrections respectively .    for the steady correction ,",
    "if @xmath152 is not too large , is of order unity for all @xmath195 .",
    "hence , as one might have expected , the projected amplitude of the ( relative ) steady correction does not significantly differ from its original amplitude in the power spectrum ( [ paramp ] ) .",
    "for the oscillatory corrections , we again consider the case where the oscillations have a high frequency . in this case , the parameter @xmath218 in ( [ paramp ] ) .",
    "( we recall that in the models of section ii , @xmath219 . ) using the stirling formula to evaluate @xmath220 yields @xmath221\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] instead of finding an exponential damping as in section [ sec : stochastic - averaging ] , we obtain a power law suppression governed by @xmath222 , in agreement with eq .  ( 13 ) in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the oscillatory deviations of the primordial spectrum provides the leading correction to multipoles only if @xmath223 one can clearly see that the geometric projection introduces a preferred conformal scale through the angular diameter distance @xmath198 , in contrast with the scale independence of the damping of stochastic origin , see ( [ avcos ] ) .    finally , to confront deviations originating from new high energy physics to observable data , it is also necessary to evaluate @xmath224 , the value of @xmath192 of eq .",
    "( [ avcos ] ) such that the damping factor from the new physics equals that from the geometric average in ( [ locl ] ) .",
    "their equality means @xmath225 =     \\delta^{-5/2 } \\ , ( q_0 d_a)^ { - \\beta } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath191 is a constant of order unity . in turn",
    ", this implies @xmath226 which is the same equation as ( [ n_eq ] ) with the substitution @xmath227 . as a consequence , unless @xmath228 , the oscillatory correction term is damped by a factor larger than @xmath229 .",
    "the geometric and stochastic averages are cumulative , in the sense that the oscillatory correction receives a second damping factor @xmath229 from the integral over the wavenumbers .",
    "it multiplies the first damping factor @xmath230 from the average over @xmath1 .    however , these two averaging procedures differ in the following important way . the stochastic average is ( almost )",
    "scale independent , in the sense that the oscillatory correction to the power is damped by the same factor @xmath231 independently of the wavenumber ( almost here must be understood in the same way as the unperturbed power spectrum is almost scale invariant , that is with a slow logarithmic dependence in @xmath5 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the geometric average considered in the previous section is only valid for large angular scales , for which the form factors can be approximated by constants . for smaller angular scales ,",
    "the @xmath201 s are oscillatory functions of @xmath5 with a frequency equal to the size of the acoustic horizon @xcite .",
    "they therefore interfere with the superimposed oscillations to the primordial power spectrum and produce potentially observable oscillations in the angular power spectrum @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the geometric averaging depends on the angular scale @xmath195 while the stochastic averaging does not .",
    "it is therefore possible to distinguish them in principle .    in brief ,",
    "two cases leading to different lessons can be found .",
    "if the detection of the superimposed oscillations in the cmb data are confirmed , this would constitute a very strong constraint on the width @xmath156 of the @xmath4 scale @xmath1 .",
    "if instead the @xmath4 damping of the oscillatory term is so strong that the steady term becomes the leading correction , no further damping would be introduced by the geometric averaging , and the corrections would be proportional to @xmath232 .",
    "this may well be too small to make them observable .    finally , as noticed in section [ sec : gener - other - class ] , the steady corrections to the power spectra receive contributions from various physical effects .",
    "lifting the induced degeneracy which impedes the access to information about quantum gravity is a challenge for future work .",
