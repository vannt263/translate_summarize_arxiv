    "it is a well - known result that a 1-dimensional irreducible shift of finite type on a finite alphabet has a unique measure of maximal entropy , the measure developed by shannon and parry @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we consider the relative case in which one is given a factor code @xmath5 from a shift of finite type @xmath1 to a sofic shift @xmath2 , and a measure @xmath3 on @xmath2 . in this case",
    "ergodic measures on @xmath1 in the fibre @xmath4 having maximal entropy in the fibre , so - called measures of relative maximal entropy , are not well understood .",
    "measures of relative maximal entropy appear frequently in different topics in symbolic dynamics , and have been applied to the problem of computing the hausdorff dimension of certain sets by gatzouras and peres  @xcite .",
    "there are connections of measures of relative maximal entropy with functions of markov chains @xcite , measures that maximize a weighted entropy functional @xcite , the theory of pressure and equilibrium states @xcite , relative pressure and relative equilibrium states @xcite , and compensation functions @xcite .",
    "other uses of such measures arise from their application in the mathematics of information transfer @xcite and information - compressing channels @xcite .",
    "unlike in the case considered by shannon and parry where the measure of maximal entropy is unique , it is known that measures of relative maximal entropy may not be unique  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask how many of such measures there may be for a particular factor code @xmath6 and an ergodic invariant measure on y. a previous result on this problem is the result of petersen , quas , and shin @xcite which established an explicit finite upper bound on the number of measures of relative maximal entropy .",
    "they considered the case ( always achievable by recoding ) that @xmath0 is a 1-block code from a 1-step shift of finite type . in this case , the main result of  @xcite states that the number of measures of relative maximal entropy is bounded above by the number of preimages of any symbol @xmath7 of @xmath2 which has positive probability with respect to the measure on @xmath2 .",
    "the bound in  @xcite suffers from not being invariant under conjugacy and becomes arbitrarily large simply by recoding to a higher block presentation . to avoid this issue",
    "one possibility is to take the minimum of this bound over all shifts of finite type @xmath8 which are conjugate to @xmath1 .",
    "however , no algorithm for computing this minimum has been found . on the other hand , in this paper",
    "we find a simpler conjugacy - invariant upper bound which can be strictly better and is never worse than the minimum - over - conjugates bound mentioned above .    given a finite - to - one factor code @xmath0 from a shift of finite type @xmath1 to a sofic shift @xmath2 , the is defined to be the minimal cardinality of the set of preimages of a point in @xmath2 .",
    "this is widely - studied and known to be invariant under recoding  @xcite .",
    "one can show that the number of preimages of every transitive point in @xmath2 is exactly the degree of @xmath0 .",
    "previous efforts to find an analogue of this when @xmath0 is infinite - to - one have proved unsuccessful  @xcite .    given @xmath9 in @xmath2",
    ", we define an equivalence relation on @xmath1 which is respected by recoding .",
    "the relation is motivated by communicating classes in markov chains .",
    "loosely , two points @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath12 lie in the same equivalence class `` transition class '' if one can find an element of @xmath12 matching either of @xmath10 and @xmath11 from @xmath13 to an arbitrarily large positive coordinate @xmath14 and matching the other at @xmath15 .",
    "the minimal number of transition classes ( always finite ) in @xmath12 when @xmath9 runs over the points in @xmath2 is called the of the code .",
    "we show that the number of transition classes over every transitive point of @xmath2 is exactly the class degree . if @xmath0 is finite - to - one the degree and the class degree of @xmath0 agree .",
    "we prove an analogue of theorem 1 in  @xcite : given an ergodic measure @xmath3 on @xmath2 , for distinct ergodic measures @xmath16 and @xmath17 of relative maximal entropy , the relative independent joining of @xmath16 and @xmath17 assigns measure zero to the set of points @xmath18 such that @xmath19,@xmath20 are in a common transition class .    using a combinatorial characterization of class degree and further arguments ,",
    "we show that the number of transition classes above a typical point of @xmath3 is an upper bound on the number of ergodic measures of maximal entropy in the fibre @xmath21 .",
    "this bound is equal to the class degree of the code when @xmath3 is ergodic and fully supported .    one key ingredient to this work is a relative version of the uniform conditional distribution property for measures of maximal entropy .",
    "we follow techniques developed by burton and steif  @xcite ( which were related to an earlier work of lanford and ruelle  @xcite ) to show a uniform conditional distribution property for measures of relative maximal entropy .",
