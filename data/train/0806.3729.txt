    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are , next to gamma ray bursts , among the most powerful transient objects in the universe .",
    "sne ia are widely believed to be explosions of c+o white dwarfs ( wds ) whose mass has grown by accretion to the chandrasekhar mass of 1.4 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "evidence for this includes total energy released ( consistent with conversion of c+o to fe ) , lack of hydrogen in the maximum light spectra ( consistent with an object whose envelope has been lost ) , light curve shape ( broadly in agreement with energy deposition from radioactive decay of fe - peak elements , as expected for exploding c+o wd s ) , and the occurrence of sne ia in old ( @xmath110 gyr ) stellar populations containing only low mass stars ( for which exploding wds represent the natural , and perhaps only possible , sn ia progenitor ) .    beyond this consensus on the exploding wd model , the precise nature of the progenitors of sne ia remains poorly constrained .",
    "progenitor models are broadly classified as  single - degenerate \" ( sd ) , in which a white dwarf grows in mass by accretion from an evolving binary companion @xcite , and  double degenerate \" ( dd ) , in which two white dwarfs merge @xcite .",
    "a variety of evolutionary paths may lead to sd and dd events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that sne ia are observed in elliptical galaxies has led to the persistent and widespread presumption that sn ia progenitors are old , low - mass stars . yet over the years there have been several hints suggesting that the sn ia rate is enhanced in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two recent papers @xcite have marshalled evidence for a strong dependence of the sn ia rate on star formation rate ( sfr ) , thus linking sne ia with young , massive stellar populations .",
    "@xcite made use of a sample of low redshift supernovae discovered in 5 targeted searches @xcite , and demonstrated a strong dependence of specific sn ia rate ( rate per unit mass ) on morphology or galaxy colour .",
    "this result was confirmed and extended by @xcite , who analyzed a sample of spectroscopically - confirmed sne ia ( redshift z=0.2 - 0.75 , spanning cosmic time 7 - 11 gyr after the big bang ) from the supernova legacy survey @xcite ( snls ) .",
    "the sn ia rate  sfr correlation found by @xcite is shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "1 ( both axes are normalized by galaxy mass ) .",
    "passive galaxies are plotted as a single data point in the lower left hand panel ; most of these galaxies are old .",
    "the variation of sn ia rate from passive galaxies to the most active galaxies is dramatic : passive galaxies possess a mass - normalized sn ia rate that is a factor of ten or more lower than found for active star - bursting systems .    in this paper",
    "we present a simple model for the sn ia rate ",
    "sfr relation in terms of stellar evolutionary timescales .",
    "this model , which is based on the sd scenario , allows an estimation of the efficiency of conversion of white dwarfs into sne ia .",
    "this provides , as we shall see , a constraint on the nature of sn ia progenitors .",
    "a first step towards understanding the rate of sne ia in galaxies is a calculation of the rate at which wds are formed in different stellar populations .",
    "it is well - known that wds ( m @xmath3 1.4 m@xmath2 ) form as the end - point of stellar evolution for stars with initial masses m @xmath3 8 m@xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the rate at which white dwarfs form clearly depends on evolutionary time scales as a function of initial stellar mass , and the initial mass function or imf . for a @xcite mass function @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , and a power - law approximation to evolutionary timescales @xmath6",
    "yr ( @xmath7 ) , it can be shown that white dwarfs form from a pure instantaneous burst of star formation at a rate that decreases with time roughly as @xmath8 .",
    "this ( somewhat counterintuitive ) result is due to the fact that the evolutionary timescales of massive stars are so much shorter than for low mass stars , even in the presence of a steeply - sloped imf favouring low mass stars .",
    "the results of a detailed calculation of wd formation rate are shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "1 , using more exact evolutionary timescales @xcite , and a power - law sfr @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "( other sfr(t ) functions give equivalent results , as will be shown . ) for passive systems with no star formation ( left hand panels ) , we plot the wd formation rate per unit galaxy mass ( wdr / m ) for a star burst with age 7.9 gyr ( the approximate age of the universe at the mean redshift of the snls sne ) . the shaded region in fig .",
    "1 includes systems as young as 5 gyr ( which would have formed @xmath10 gyr after the big bang for the most distant objects in snls ) . for active systems with star formation",
    ", we plot wdr / m as a function of star formation rate per unit galaxy mass ( sfr / m ) .",
    "remarkably , the form of this diagram is very insensitive to the details of star formation history ( other than age ) .",
    "old starburst models with increasing sfr(t ) ( @xmath11 ) overlap young models with decreasing sfr ( @xmath12 ) , and all of these models lie within the upper shaded region of the figure . a variety of composite stellar populations , comprising an old passive bulge / halo and a star - forming disk ( with the proportion of bulge to disk mass given by * ? ? ?",
    "* to match observed galaxy colours ) can be seen to fall in the shaded region of fig .",
    "1 , as do models with bursts of star formation .",
    "models with exponentially decreasing sfr(t ) match the locus of the sfr @xmath13 models , as do models constructed using the pegase.2 evolutionary infall scenario @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the range of b - k colours exhibited by all of these models spans the full dynamic range of colour exhibited by real galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the locus of the white dwarf formation rate shown in fig .",
    "1 is well - determined , independently of uncertainties in the evolutionary models .",
    "sfr / m has units of @xmath14 , and is approximately the inverse of the gas consumption timescale of a galaxy ( if sfr were held constant ) . identifying @xmath15 ( sfr / m)@xmath16 as a characteristic mean age of a model , one expects ( wdr / m ) @xmath17 ( sfr / m)@xmath18 , roughly as observed in fig .",
    "the increase of wd formation rate with sfr / m is therefore a reflection of the fact that the mean age of stellar populations with a large sfr / m ( small gas consumption timescale ) is smaller",
    ".      these calculations of specific white dwarf formation rate , wdr / m , can now be compared with estimates of the sne ia rate per unit stellar mass as derived from the snls survey @xcite .",
    "scaling the white dwarf formation rate curve by a factor @xmath19 provides an excellent match to the snls observations ( and also to the observations of * ? ? ?",
    "however , to convert @xmath20 ( the ratio of sn ia to wd formation rates ) to the physically more interesting conversion efficiency @xmath21 ( the fraction includes the binary fraction ",
    "e.g. if the fraction of binaries were 0.5 , then the fraction of wd s in binaries that become sne ia would be @xmath10.02 .",
    "available evidence @xcite suggests that the fraction of binaries increases with mass .",
    "] of white dwarfs that explode as sne ia ) , it is necessary to correct for the time delay , @xmath22 , between the formation of a wd primary and an sn ia event . in the case of an sd system , this delay is due to the residual time that it takes the secondary star ( of mass @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is mass ratio ) to evolve .",
    "the available evidence suggests that the distribution of @xmath24 is flat @xcite , or even strongly peaked towards equal masses @xcite , for close binaries .",
    "we have computed detailed models for sd binaries with different distributions of q , using both numerical integration and monte carlo techniques . a flat distribution in @xmath24 results in rates that are @xmath25 lower than for `` undelayed '' @xmath26 models ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . most important , this factor is nearly constant for all sfr / m . correcting @xmath20 for the distribution of @xmath24 values yields a white dwarf to sn ia conversion efficiency @xmath21 in the range 0.01 - 0.015 .",
    "( a power - law distribution of mass ratios @xmath27 , corresponding to a distribution of secondary masses @xmath28 , results in constant @xmath21 provided that @xmath29 .",
    "a distribution of secondary masses drawn from the imf gives wdr / m@xmath30constant , independent of sfr / m .",
    "this is discussed further in  3 and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper 2 ) . )",
    "a calculation for the dd model is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however we note that a similar result ( @xmath31constant ) is obtained if the distribution of semimajor axes for dd binaries is independent of mass ( paper 2 ) .",
    "we also note that @xmath32 is valid for any mass range dominated by the sd channel .",
    "an alternate way of describing the data is through the delay time distribution ( dtd ) . from ",
    "2 , it can be seen that the data are consistent with a continuous delay time distribution dtd @xmath33 ( for a burst ) . fig .",
    "3 shows that the data are bracketed by dtd @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    in summary :",
    "the snia rate is approximately 1% of the stellar death rate , from passive galaxies ( sfr=0 ) to starburst galaxies ( sfr / m @xmath36 y@xmath16 ) , with little dependence on the details of the stellar population mix .",
    "the dependence of sn ia rate on star formation rate in both active and passive galaxies is consistent with a simple timescale model based on the sd scenario , with a uniform wd conversion efficiency @xmath371% for all stars .",
    "the sn ia rate ",
    "sfr rate dependence is also consistent with a continuous dtd @xmath38 .",
    "if more than one channel produces sne ia , @xmath39% still holds for any progenitor mass range in which the sd channel is dominant .",
    "our models are different from those of @xcite since we consider the scaling of the sn ia rate with sfr , thus minimizing the effects of variations in star formation history .",
    "in addition our models do not initially include variations of @xmath21 with mass ( for reasons that will become apparent ) .",
    "however , the slope of the dtd for a simple aging burst agrees with that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) for @xmath40 gyr .      what is the uncertainty in the efficiency factor @xmath21 ? changing the functional form of sfr(t ) has already been eliminated as a source of error .",
    "changing the imf to a two - piece or three - piece imf @xcite ( with increasing power - law slope at higher mass ) remains consistent with the locus of white dwarf models in fig . 1",
    ", provided @xmath21 is reduced by 25% .",
    "systematic errors in mass affect the vertical placement of data points in fig . 1 , and these could be a factor of 2 or larger .",
    "systematic errors of a factor of 2 in sfr / m affect @xmath21 by about 40% .",
    "the overall completeness of the snls rates , from which @xmath21 was derived , approaches 100% @xcite .",
    "it thus appears that the efficiency factor @xmath21 is accurate to about a factor of two .",
    "most important , the relative efficiency factor between galaxies of different sfr / m should be unaffected by these systematic errors .",
    "is @xmath41 reasonable from other considerations ?",
    "this is a difficult question to answer .",
    "theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) give efficiencies in the range 0.0010.01 , but are subject to a host of uncertainties ( e.g. the distributions of binary mass ratios and separations , and the precise evolutionary scenario for sne ia ) .",
    "for the milky way , the observed sn ia rate @xcite and wd formation rate ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yield @xmath42 0.12% .",
    "this number is extremely uncertain , but it would seem to rule out conversion efficiencies larger than a few per cent .    other observational determinations of efficiency ( from the ratio of sne ia to core collapse sne , from the a and b rate parameters @xcite , and from abundances ) span a huge range ( 140% ) , even approaching 100% for intermediate mass stars @xcite .",
    "part of this discrepancy is due to the different progenitor mass range ( 38m@xmath2 ) used by maoz ; however our determination of @xmath41 will still apply for any mass range dominated by the sd channel . to raise",
    "the value of @xmath21 to 0.1 would require 90% sn ia incompleteness in the snls survey , or sfr values that are overestimated by a factor of 100 .",
    "both of these possibilities are untenable .",
    "we now turn to relative values of @xmath21 for populations with different sfr .",
    "the relative wd to sn ia conversion efficiency @xmath21 can be measured directly in fig . 1 for populations with different sfr / m , i.e. mean age or mass .",
    "in particular , it can be seen that the conversion efficiency for old stars in passive galaxies is similar to that for the most active starburst galaxies .",
    "the variation of @xmath21 with sfr is smaller than a factor two .",
    "the sd model results in lower conversion efficiencies @xmath21 for low mass stars , for a variety of reasons .",
    "a passive 10 gyr old population is populated with stars with m @xmath43 1 m@xmath2 , and , because of mass loss on the giant branch , such stars produce white dwarfs of mass 0.5 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a binary system initially comprising two 1 m@xmath2 stars would therefore not evolve into a 1.4 m@xmath2 white dwarf unless mass transfer were exceptionally efficient .",
    "below about 2 m@xmath2 ( turnoff age 1 gyr ) , a he ( rather than c+o ) white dwarf is the likely outcome in a close binary @xcite , and such stars do not produce sne ia .",
    "the evolutionary time of the secondary sets the clock for the sn ia explosion , and at low mass , some fraction of the secondaries have not yet completed their evolution .",
    "an increasing binary fraction with mass @xcite lowers the sn ia rate at low mass relative to high mass .",
    "all of these factors will conspire to produce lower efficiencies at low sfr / m , relative to the most active galaxies .",
    "the models of @xcite represent sd efficiency at low mass by including a continuous variation of @xmath21 for @xmath44 2 m@xmath2 , with @xmath45 .",
    "the result of such an efficiency variation is shown in fig .",
    "3 . normalizing the models to the most active galaxies , the computed and observed sn",
    "ia rates for passive galaxies disagree by a factor of 7",
    ". if sd progenitor scenarios are less efficient at low mass , as is expected , then sd progenitors can not be the only objects producing sne ia ; some other class of model ( perhaps the double degenerate model ) must be invoked to explain some , and perhaps all , sne ia .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the observational lack of hydrogen in the late - time ejecta of sne ia @xcite .",
    "if secondary star masses for _ close _ binaries were drawn from the imf , then close binaries with a high mass primary and low mass secondary would be common , and the number of sne ia in old progenitors would be enhanced , compensating for the expected lower conversion efficiency at @xmath46 .",
    "we reiterate , however , that the available evidence supports an imf for secondaries in close binaries that is _ not _ drawn from the imf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most sub - luminous sne ia ( stretch parameter @xmath47 ) are neglected in the rates @xcite . including these objects ( mostly in passive galaxies )",
    "makes the disagreement between observations and predictions of the sd scenario even more extreme . a strong type - dependent incompleteness ( with 90% incompleteness for starburst galaxies )",
    "would be required to explain the observations ; there is no evidence for such an extreme effect .",
    "the sn ia rate is about 1% of the white dwarf formation rate , for all star formation rates and for a wide range of stellar population mixes .",
    "the sn ia rate is also consistent with a continuous delay time distribution @xmath48 .",
    "the dependence of the sn ia rate on sfr matches the predictions of a simple timescale model based on the single degenerate channel , but only under the ( unrealistic ) assumption that the fraction ( 1% ) of white dwarfs exploding as sne ia is independent of progenitor mass .",
    "we conclude , as have others , that a class of model other than the sd model must be invoked to explain at least some sne ia .",
    "nevertheless , the conversion efficiency of 1% holds for any mass range dominated by the sd channel .",
    "this conclusion is valid provided that secondary stars in close binaries have a distribution of mass ratios @xmath24 that is approximately flat or rising towards @xmath26 .",
    "clearly there is a need for a better understanding of the the distribution of secondary masses in close binaries .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the predictions of sn ia rate in this paper provide a better match to observations than does the empirical @xmath49 formula @xcite .",
