    "transport properties in monolayer graphene ( mlg ) and bilayer graphene ( blg ) have drawn a great deal of theoretical and experimental attention in recent years due to interest in both fundamental physics and potential electronic applications .",
    "an interesting transport property is the thermoelectric effect ( te ) in which a temperature difference @xmath2 across a conductor creates an electric potential @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the thermoelectric power , also called seebeck coefficient , and characterizes the thermoelectric sensitivity of the conductor .",
    "thus a material with a high value of @xmath4 is a necessary condition for it to be used in thermoelectric applications .",
    "the performance of the thermoelectric material in such te devices is determined by a dimensionless parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath7 is the thermal conductivity including both electron and phonon contributions , and @xmath8 is the temperature . hence such materials should have a high power factor @xmath9 and a low @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "extensive experiments have been carried out by kim @xmath11 @xcite on transport properties in graphene .",
    "for ultraclean suspended graphene , bolotin @xmath12@xcite have shown that resistivity is strongly temperature dependent . at low temperatures ( @xmath13 )",
    "the electron transport is near - ballistic having a mobility of @xmath14 170000 @xmath15 . for large carrier densities",
    ", resistivity increases with @xmath8 and is linear above 50k .",
    "this suggests that the carrier scattering is from acoustic phonons .",
    "they also reported the highest measured value of mobility ( @xmath14 120000 @xmath15 ) at @xmath8=240k . using a micro - fabricated heating system , electrical conductivity and seebeck coefficients",
    "were measured for the first time by zuev @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the gate - dependent and hence carrier - density - dependent conductance and seebeck coefficient showed good agreement with the semiclassical mott relation .",
    "it was shown that the sign of seebeck coefficients changes as the majority carrier density shifts from the electron to that of the hole .",
    "the gate - dependent seebeck coefficient and nernst signal on graphene in a magnetic field was studied by ong @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "quantities closely related to @xmath6 are mobility ( @xmath16 ) and resistivity ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "since a field effect transistor can measure the mobility , we use @xmath16 to define mobility so as to not confuse it with chemical potential ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "values of @xmath16 as high as 20000 @xmath19 , have been reported for mlg at low temperatures @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the resistivity @xmath17 strongly depends on the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) scattering in the material and varies linearly with temperature , @xmath20 , at temperatures comparable to or higher than the debye temperature @xmath21 , reflecting a classical behavior of the phonons .",
    "the bosonic nature of the phonons becomes evident below @xmath21 resulting in a rapid decrease of resistivity which for a normal conductor @xmath22 , known as the bloch - gr@xmath0neisen ( bg ) regime .",
    "this defines a new characteristic temperature scale for the low - density e - ph scattering , the bg temperature @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the phonon group velocity and fermi momentum , respectively .",
    "it was theoretically predicted @xcite that in a two - dimensional systems such as graphene , there is a smooth transition in the resistivity from a linear dependence @xmath20 to @xmath26 .",
    "this two - dimensional ( 2d ) bg was observed experimentally by efetov and kim @xcite in graphene .",
    "temperature dependence of electron transport in graphene and its bilayer have also been studied by morozov @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "they have shown that if extrinsic disorders are eliminated , mobilities higher than @xmath28 are attainable .",
    "ponomarenko @xmath12 @xcite studied the scattering mechanism on graphene on various substrates and found no significant changes in carrier mobility on different substrates questioning the largely believed assumption that the dominant source of scattering in graphene is the charge impurities in the substrate .",
    "the experimental works carried out by various groups such as kim @xmath11 @xcite , geim @xmath11@xcite , ong @xmath11 @xcite , nam @xmath11 @xcite and wang @xmath11 @xcite on gate - dependent electron transport properties of mlg and blg have motivated us to carry out computational studies based on first - principles calculations of mlg - doped hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) and pure blg under the influence of an electric field , since there is a direct correspondence between gate voltage and chemical potential .",
    "it is observed that @xmath4 is strongly dependent on the amount of doping in the case of mlg",
    ". a marked increase of @xmath4 is observed when an electric field is applied perpendicularly to the plane of the bilayer graphene sheets .",
    "a further motivation to study the effects of impurity scattering on graphene sheets was provided by a recent paper by ghahari @xmath11 @xcite , which reported an enhanced seebeck coefficient in graphene due to scattering .",
    "we have used a tight - binding model ( tbm ) for graphene with impurities and solved the boltzmann transport equations for electrons to study the effect of impurities on electrical conductance .",
    "our study used a large @xmath29 mesh to capture correctly the enhancement of the seebeck coefficient and a constant decrease in electrical conductivity due to doping and decrease in mobility by an order of magnitude as observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "finally , we have reexamined the lattice thermal conductivity in mlg and blg using the lattice boltzmann transport method @xcite employing the phonon bandstructure calculated from first - principles dft @xcite .",
    "our calculated phonon dispersion agrees with previous results @xcite , whereas the lattice thermal conductivity shows quantitative agreement with recent experimental data @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to illustrate that all essential thermoelectric parameters of mlg and blg , both for electrical and lattice thermal transport , can be accurately calculated using first - principles electronic and phonon band structure together with the boltzmann transport theory .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with experimental data .",
    "all electronic structure calculations were carried out using the density functional theory ( dft ) based plane - wave method as implemented in the quantum espresso code @xcite .",

    "the kohn - sham equations are solved self - consistently to achieve an accuracy of @xmath32 ry in the total energy .",
    "plane - wave methods incorporate periodicity and hence in order to avoid interaction between sheets we have a vacuum spacing of 22 along the @xmath33 direction .",
    "the van der waals interaction was included for multilayered systems .      the semiclassical boltzmann transport theory ( bte ) applied to band electrons , as implemented in the boltztrap code @xcite ,",
    "was used to calculate the transport properties .",
    "the bte allows us to calculate the thermoelectric parameters along two orthogonal principal axes in the plane of the two - dimensional graphene layers .",
    "thus the calculated thermoelectric parameters are taken as average over those along the principal directions .",
    "the energies and their corresponding k - points were taken from the electronic structure calculations to deduce various transport parameters .",
    "for example , the group velocity of the electrons @xmath34 is given by , @xmath35 in the relaxation - time approximation electrical conductivity is then expressed as , @xmath36 d\\epsilon\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] detailed studies @xcite have shown that to a good approximation the relaxation time @xmath37 is isotropic .",

    "we have used the phonon boltzmann transport method to solve the boltzmann transport equations for phonons starting from a set of interatomic force constants ( ifcs ) obtained from the phonon dispersion obtained using _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , as implemented in the shengbte code @xcite .",
    "lattice thermal conductivity calculations require the harmonic second - order interatomic force constants ( ifcs ) as well as the anharmonic third - order ifcs .",

    "the @xmath73 behavior of resistivity reflects the two - dimensional nature of electrons in graphene . at high temperatures",
    "the quantization of lattice waves is irrelevant ; therefore the scattering is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the fluctuations about their equilibrium position that is proportional to @xmath84 , which leads to the linear behavior of resistivity at higher temperatures .",
    "the reduction from the @xmath85 behavior of the resistivity for a typical bulk metal to the @xmath73 one , as seen in graphene , is due to reduced electron fermi surface of graphene , smaller than the size of its phonon brillouin zone .",

    "this implies that a small change in the chemical potential is equivalent to a large change in gate voltage .",
    "this is the reason why we choose only a small range of chemical potentials to demonstrate the bloch - gr@xmath0neisen behavior as observed experimentally .",
    "if one looks at the study by kim @xmath11 @xcite , the linear part of resistivity ( higher @xmath8 regime ) increases quickly with an increase of gate voltage of only 1ev .",

    "this suggests that our calculations agree well with the experiment .",
    "the phonon dispersion of blg is very similar to that of mlg except for a characteristic feature of an additional low - frequency optical mode with energy nearly about 108 @xmath129 at @xmath127 .",

    "since the grniesen parameter ( @xmath131 ) provides useful information on the phonon relaxation time and the anharmonic interactions between lattice waves and the degree of phonon scattering , we have therefore calculated the mode - dependent grneisen parameter ( @xmath131 ) for mlg and blg .",

    "negative ( positive ) @xmath131 implies an increase ( decrease ) in phonon frequency when the lattice constant is increased .",
    "the slight difference in the grneisen parameters in mlg and blg is , in the case of blg near the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath127 point ) , @xmath139 corresponding to the out - of - plane optical mode changing sign unlike in mlg .",

    "our calculations also show that at higher temperatures , @xmath144 does not change significantly by addition of another layer which is consistent with the report by koh @xmath151 @xcite , suggesting that @xmath144 between graphene and its environment has a much larger influence than that of individual graphene sheets .",
    "we find that @xmath144 increases initially from 20 k to 170 k for mlg and to 230 k for blg , before decreasing . for mlg ,",
    "if we compare our results to the experimental data by chen @xmath11 @xcite , we find that the maximum values of @xmath144 seen experimentally occuring at a temperature between 150 k and 200 k are in agreement to our calculations .",
    "therefore , calculations involving both harmonic and anharmonic ifcs , solving the bte for phonons as done in the shengbte method , provides an accurate method for the calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity .",
