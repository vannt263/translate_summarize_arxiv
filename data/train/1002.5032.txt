    "it is advantageous for many purposes to express the theory in lagrangian form . as in a classical theory",
    ", one can easily derive the equations of motion . in a quantum theory",
    ", the lagrangian also provides a convenient framework for quantization and the development of perturbation theory , via feynman rules , in a lorentz - covariant fashion .",

    "but this tendency is overcome by _ antiscreening _ effects that arise from the contributions of gluon loops to the vacuum polarization .",

    "the basic features of the hadron spectrum have been reproduced in a convincing way .",
    "some of the simplest hadronic transition amplitudes , needed to understand flavor physics , are in similarly good shape .",
    "the aspiration here is to compute many simple amplitudes with total errors that are 1% or smaller .",
    "such precision will require nonperturbative matching and the charmed sea .",
    "indeed , a next - generation assault on @xmath89 decays via @xmath229 will hinge on such lattice qcd calculations ( ref .  ) .",
    "calculations of similar difficulty are related to moments of the parton distributions .",
    "reliable lattice - qcd calculations would pin down predictions of signals and backgrounds at the lhc .",
    "the most crucial in this regard , and most challenging computationally , are moments of the gluon density inside the proton .",
    "see ref .   and    * .",
    "*     precision perturbative qcd and precision lattice qcd are important and challenging , yet programmatic",
    ". other future avenues for research in qcd will explore its richness in ways that are harder to anticipate .",
    "qcd is frequently , and justifiably , hailed as a triumph of reductionist science , distilling the plethora of hadrons and their complicated properties into a simple lagrangian field theory [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcdlag ] ) ] .",
    "now that qcd is accepted as a law of nature , however , it may be time to characterize qcd research by the phenomena that emerge from this tantalizing simple form . what are hadron masses and chiral symmetry breaking , if not emergent phenomena ?    many avenues offer themselves for quantitative and qualitative study .",
    "although the spectrum of the lowest - lying conventional hadrons is well - computed , it remains a challenge to compute the masses of excited hadrons , and even the lowest - lying glueball , hybrid , and exotic states .",
    "while these masses tie into experimental programs , it would simply be intriguing to see towers of bound states emerge from the qcd lagrangian .",
    "another structure that emerges from qcd is a rich phase structure ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : thermo ] ) . a fuller understanding will require experiments with heavy - ion collisions , including the higher - density probes of the compressed baryonic matter experiment .    * .",
    "*     complementary theoretical work will require both model studies and lattice qcd calculations , although a breakthrough in finite - density lattice qcd could relegate some model studies to secondary importance .",
    "the transition to ( effectively ) deconfined quarks at nonzero temperature and density may help explain why color can not be isolated in the ( zero - temperature ) ground state of qcd .",
    "finally , from the emergent phenomenon of hadrons emerges the whole field of nuclear physics .",
    "qcd is just beginning to answer questions about nuclear physics , and some nuclear physicists see the future of their field as qcd ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : nuke ] ) .    to elucidate these features of qcd",
    ", it will help to study lightweight versions of yang - mills theories with quarks .",
    "for example , with one flavor there is no chiral symmetry to break ",
    "the anomaly represents an explicit breaking of the u(1 ) chiral symmetry ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : anomaly])presenting a laboratory to study confinement without spontaneous symmetry breaking :    * .",
    "*     what properties does this confining theory share with qcd ?",
    "what does it lose along with the loss of chiral symmetry , spontaneously broken ?",
    "an irony of nature s version of qcd is that the up- and down - quark masses are so much smaller than @xmath125 , so isospin is an excellent approximate symmetry .",
    "( more properly , isospin follows from @xmath230 . )",
    "alternatively , one could imagine a theory with two quarks whose masses , and mass difference , are comparable to or larger than  @xmath125 .",
    "which dynamical features remain , and which are lost ?",
    "whatever results academic investigations bring , qcd will retain a strong and deep connection to particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology , and nuclear physics .",
    "indeed , often qcd binds these fields to each other . as discussed above",
    ", qcd will always play a central role , within the standard model and beyond , for collider physics .",
    "a dream of particle theorists is to unify the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "further precision for @xmath58 and quark masses will inform and constrain this dream .",
    "now that it is fairly well established that the up - quark mass can not vanish , the strong cp problem demands other solutions .",
    "the most elegant proposal augments qcd with additional symmetry ( ref .  ) .",
    "the observable consequence is a pseudoscalar particle called the axion , which may comprise part of the `` dark '' matter of the universe ( ref .  ) .",
    "a future challenge is to connect nuclei to qcd .",
    "some aspects befuddle models , because some relevant properties are too hard to measure .",
    "for example , the three - nucleon interaction is an important missing piece to the puzzle of nuclear structure .",
    "some questions are almost philosophical : how do @xmath58 and the quark masses lead to various happenstances of nuclear physics , some of which seem implausible , yet are necessary for carbon - based life to exist ? looking beyond earth , details of the quark - gluon plasma influence the evolution of the early universe . above the transition temperature",
    ", hadrons do not `` dissolve '' quite as fast as sometimes thought .",
    "another interesting qcd calculation , which has not yet been carried out , is to determine the @xmath231-nucleon interaction .",
    "this is not a prosaic matter of hadronic physics , but a nuclear property that influences whether a supernova evolves to a neutron star or a black hole ( ref .  ) .    in summary ,",
    "qcd is not our `` most perfect theory '' ( ref .  ) merely because asymptotic freedom ensures its scope on towards the highest energies , temperatures , and densities .",
    "it is also a rich and varied physical theory , exhibiting qualitatively different behavior in different regimes , all stemming ultimately on the dynamics of quarks and gluons .",
    "for all the explanatory power of qcd , it still provides problems for physicists to work  on .",
