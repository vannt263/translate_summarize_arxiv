    "if a binary in which mass is transferred from one component to the other is eccentric , the mass transfer rate will be periodic at the binary period @xcite .",
    "the largest class of such binaries is be / x - ray binaries , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for reviews .",
    "all known systems of this type consist of a ( strongly magnetized ) neutron star orbiting , usually in an eccentric orbit , a high - mass ( unevolved ) be star . the accretion occurs via stellar wind and interaction with a circumstellar decretion disc around the massive star , and is maximized around the periastron @xcite .",
    "indeed , most of those systems show x - ray periodicity at their orbital periods , so - called type - i x - ray outbursts @xcite , seen , e.g. , in a053866 , exo 2030 + 375 , a0535 + 26 , ax j0049.47323 , 4u 0115 + 63 ( see , e.g. , references in @xcite ) . the accretion onto the neutron star in those systems is thought to occur via a ( non - stationary ) accretion disc @xcite .",
    "arguments for the existence of an accretion disc include a lag between the onset of optical activity and an x - ray outburst , abrupt rises and linear decays of outburst ( implying the storage of material in a reservoir ) , and spin - up of the neutron star during outburst @xcite . the last phenomenon is seen during x - ray pulsations at the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "another class of binaries relevant to this work consists of x - ray pulsars with supergiant donors . here",
    ", accretion is via stellar winds and , in some cases , via a roche lobe overflow .",
    "some of those systems have eccentric orbits , which then cause periodically varying accretion , e.g. , gx 3012 @xcite .",
    "it has the orbital period of @xmath0 d and the eccentricity of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the presence of an accretion disc in this system is discussed by @xcite , and details of the mass transfer from the companion , including the presence of an accretion stream , are studied by @xcite .",
    "another eccentric x - ray binary is the peculiar system cir x-1 , which contains either a low or high - mass donor @xcite , of @xmath2 d and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the system shows strong periodicity at the orbital period in x - rays @xcite and in radio @xcite .",
    "accretion in that system may occur via a roche - lobe overflow near the periastron @xcite .",
    "then there is the case of the ultracompact low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820303 , where @xmath3 s is detected in x - rays @xcite .",
    "in addition to the binary period , it shows a strong periodicity at 170 d @xcite , and there is compelling evidence that it is due to the corresponding long - term modulation of the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the main model of the long - term modulation is an interaction with a third star @xcite , which causes a periodic modulation of the eccentricity of the inner binary @xcite . though @xmath4 in this model , the mass supply rate to the outer disc is strongly modulated at both the orbital and superorbital periods .",
    "an important issue is whether this orbital modulation of the mass supply rate can be seen in x - rays @xcite .",
    "enhancement of the mass - transfer rate around the periastron in low - mass x - ray binaries with @xmath4 has also been proposed by @xcite to be responsible for flares discovered from some of x - ray sources in ngc 7469 by @xcite .",
    "again , an issue to examine is whether periodic enhancements in the mass transfer rate in those sources can actually lead to x - ray flares .",
    "viscous damping of a change in the mass supply rate is also an important issue for understanding state transitions in x - ray binaries , see , e.g. , @xcite for the case of a cataclysmic variable .",
    "thus , the question of the response of an inner part of the disc to a changing mass supply rate in its outer parts is an important astrophysical issue . here , we study this problem by calculating the effect of the disc viscosity on the propagation of a disturbance from the disc outer edge to the inner one .",
    "our main method ( section [ green ] ) is to calculate green s functions for the problem , i.e. , the disc response to a @xmath5-function pulse of the mass supply .",
    "convolution of the green s functions with any form of mass supply rate , see equation ( [ eq : mdotin ] ) , gives the mass accretion rate at the inner edge of the disc .",
    "the squared fourier transform of the green s function multiplied by the power spectrum spectrum of the mass supply rate gives the power spectrum of the accretion rate , see equation ( [ eq : convolution ] ) . in particular , if the supply rate is sinusoidal , the absolute value of the fourier transform gives the factor by which the original amplitude is reduced . after presenting our theoretical results ( sections [ green ] , [ results ] ) ,",
    "we apply them to x - ray binaries ( section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "we calculate propagation of variability of the mass flow rate through an accretion discs by solving time - dependent disc structure .",
    "we assume that the disc is geometrically thin , axisymmetric and keplerian .",
    "the equations of continuity and angular momentum transport by viscosity are @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the disc radial coordinate , the surface density , and the mass flow rate , respectively . instead of solving the energy equation",
    ", we assume that the kinematic viscosity , @xmath10 , is a power - law function of only @xmath7 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the disc outer radius . in the @xmath13-viscosity prescription ,",
    "@xmath14 ( using the conventions of @xcite ) , where @xmath13 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath15 is the sound speed , and @xmath16 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "then , possible values of @xmath17 include @xmath18 for a disc without cooling , @xmath19 for an isothermal disc , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 for a thin disc supported by gas pressure and dominated by either electron scattering or bound - free kramers opacity , respectively @xcite . in general , the viscosity as a function of radius may not be a power law , e.g. , when the dominant source of opacity changes with the radius .",
    "we also note that a propagating disturbance in @xmath8 will change the local temperature , and thus both the sound speed and viscosity , @xmath10 .",
    "however , following the treatment of @xcite and @xcite , we neglect here this nonlinearity .",
    "the propagation of variability can be calculated by a simple analytical model assuming the disc extending from infinity to @xmath22 , where the density vanishes . at an initial moment ,",

    "@xcite assumed that the neutron star in gx 3012 accretes from a slow , dense , circumstellar wind , in which case @xmath196 . then at periastron , @xmath197 becomes @xmath198 ^ 3 $ ] , which for @xmath199 , @xmath1 @xcite is @xmath200 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ratio ] ) then yields @xmath201 .",
    "thus , the viscosity damping of the orbital periodicity is negligible in gx 3012 .",
    "similar considerations apply to eccentric be / x - ray binaries .",
    "the case of cir x-1 is less clear given the uncertainty about its system parameters . @xcite",
    "have modelled the orbital phase dependence of the mass transfer rate in cir x-1 using the model of @xcite , and they estimated @xmath202 d , i.e. , also less than its @xmath120 .",
    "thus , viscosity has probably a minor effect on the observed orbital periodicity in that object .",
    "observationally , we do see strong periodicity at @xmath120 , which also implies @xmath203 .",
    "we also note that the time scale of state transitions in black - hole or neutron - star binaries is likely to be the viscous time scale at the radius of the mass supply ( different from the case of outbursts of either x - ray or dwarf novae , where the time scale is by a factor of @xmath204 shorter , @xcite ) .",
    "then , our results appear to rule out the mass supply in cyg x-1 ( with @xmath205 d ) being at the outer edge of a standard disc with the size comparable to its roche lobe radius . if this were the case , @xmath206 would be @xmath207",
    ". then , any change of the mass supply rate to the disc would result in a change of the mass accretion rate in the inner disc being on a time scale of @xmath208 .",
    "this is much longer than the observed time scale of state transitions in this system of a few @xmath120 ( e.g. , fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the state transitions in cyg x-1 can not be caused by a change of @xmath73 at the outer edge of a standard accretion disc .",
    "indeed , though the donor almost fills its roche lobe , the wind accretion is still dominant @xcite , and the size of the disc is then likely to be much smaller than that of the roche lobe of the black hole . equation ( [ eq : wind ] ) with @xmath209 , @xmath210 @xcite and @xmath211 yields then a rather small disc , with @xmath212 , at which equation ( [ eq : ratio ] ) yields @xmath213 .",
    "( note that the wind velocity around the compact object in cyg x-1 is not well determined , which makes the determination of @xmath197 rather uncertain . )",
    "the combination of the actual disc size in cyg x-1 ( which may be intermediate between those of the pure roche - lobe overflow and wind accretion cases ) and the viscosity parameter may correspond to @xmath214 , as it appears to be implied by the observations .",
    "still , a large accretion disc can be present if the actual viscous time is much shorter than the standard one , as in the model of @xcite .",
    "we can also invert equation ( [ eq : ratio ] ) in order to obtain the disc size corresponding to a given @xmath215 .",
    "this yields , @xmath216^{2/3}. \\label{eq : radius}\\ ] ] we see that @xmath217 implies @xmath218 in general .    throughout the present study",
    ", we have assumed that a disc has an axisymmetric structure and have examined only the viscous damping effect .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite performed three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of be / x - ray systems and claimed that time - dependent mass transfer to the disc will produce a non - axisymmetric structure because of the ram pressure by the incoming stream .",
    "then , a spiral wave is created and its inward propagation significantly enhances the mass - accretion rate onto the neutron star ( see also @xcite in the context of binary black holes ) . if this is the case , it is possible to produce appreciable light variations even when the viscous time scale at the outer edge of the disc is much longer than the time scale of the mass input .",
    "our simple analyses presented in this paper does not allow to examine this effect and multi - dimensional simulations are necessary in future work .    in our applications ,",
    "we have considered only binaries .",
    "however , our results on the viscous damping of variability hold for any accretion disc , also those around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei .",
    "we have calculated in detail the effect of viscous damping of variability in accretion discs . we have first considered the infinite - disc model of @xcite . for it , we have obtained a simple form of the green s function for @xmath73 , equation ( [ eq : green ] ) , as well as its fourier transform , equation ( [ eq : fourier ] ) .",
    "the latter gives the fractional viscous damping at a given variability frequency , approximately given by @xmath219 . as a simple application of our green s function , the case of a step function increase of @xmath73 yields an approximately exponential approach to the steady state , @xmath220 .",
    "we have then calculated numerically a realistic finite - disc model with the mass supply at its outer boundary .",
    "we have found significant differences with respect to the infinite - disc model . in particular , a single pulse at the disc outer edge results in an exponential decay after a fraction of the viscous time at the disc outer edge , whereas the infinite - disc model yields a much broader power - law decay .",
    "the power - law behaviour is due to the infinite size , allowing the flow to diffuse back from arbitrarily large radii .",
    "given the differences , we have fitted the finite - disc green s functions by a simple form , and calculated its fourier transform .",
    "we have also calculated numerically time - dependent disc behaviour for a number of more complex cases , in particular for periodic modulations of the mass supply rate .",
    "we have applied our results to a number of x - ray binaries .",
    "periodic variability resulting from eccentricity is usually very strongly damped in low - mass x - ray binaries , which accretion discs have the size comparable to that of the roche lobe of the compact object .",
    "this is the case , in particular , in 4u 1820303 or in flaring binaries in ngc 7469 .",
    "the periodic mass transfer in eccentric binaries is much easier to observe in high - mass x - ray binaries , where accretion is via a wind and the accretion discs can be truncated at radii much smaller than the size of the roche lobe , resulting in the viscous time being relatively short . in particular , the viscous damping is negligible in gx 3012 , be / x - ray binaries and cir x-1 . in the case of cyg",
    "x-1 , the observed time scale at which state transitions take place is comparable to its orbital period , which implies the accretion disc being also truncated at a radius much lower than the roche - lobe size .",
    "this may be due to the presence of wind accretion in this system .",
