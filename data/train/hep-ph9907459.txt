    "diffractive high energy elastic scattering for hadrons appears to find a satisfactory explanation in the framework of the regge theory with the exchange of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "rising cross sections can be accounted for by assuming a pomeron intercept slightly higher than one  @xcite or , in a qcd approach , by considering the pomeron as a gluon ladder  @xcite .",
    "the growth of total cross sections can also be described in a way compatible with the froissart bound in the eikonal model  @xcite or by assuming that the pomeron is represented by a double pole in the complex @xmath0plane  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the above picture , inclusive diffractive collisions in proton - proton or antiproton - proton scattering , where one of the initial particles changes only slightly its momentum and appears in the final state isolated in rapidity , seem to require deep modifications to the standard regge models .",
    "the basic problem with diffraction dissociation , known for long  @xcite , is that the integrated cross section @xmath13 appears to grow faster than the total cross section @xmath14 , thus violating unitarity .",
    "for example , in the case of a supercritical pomeron with @xmath15 , @xmath13 grows twice as fast , @xmath16 , as the total cross section does , @xmath17 .",
    "the only way to resolve this discrepancy seemed to require the vanishing of the triple pomeron coupling ( pomeron decoupling  @xcite ) , which however contradicts the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "a number of different unitarization recipes have been proposed in order to modify the energy dependence of the predicted cross section .",
    "eikonal corrections  @xcite succeed in reproducing the main features of single diffraction at high energy , while the same effect can be reached by the inclusion of cuts in the regge theory  @xcite . recently",
    "a different , more phenomenological , approach has been considered  @xcite .",
    "renormalization  @xcite or damping  @xcite of the pomeron flux , that consists in setting a limit to the probability that the proton emits a pomeron , allow for a rising of the total diffraction cross section compatible with experimental data .",
    "all the above approaches are based on a supercritical pomeron input with a pomeron intercept larger than one .",
    "apart from the incompatibility with the experimentally rising cross sections , a unity intercept pomeron would present analogous problems with unitarity  @xcite .",
    "if , however , the partial wave amplitude , for the pomeron exchange , presents a simple and a double pole in the complex @xmath0plane , cross sections will grow with energy and it will be possible to satisfy unitarity at the born level , without eikonalization  @xcite . in all ( or most ) of the models explored until now , the pomeron was assumed to be an isolated single regge pole . from qcd we know however  @xcite that the pomeron is not a single pole , but rather a complicated set of singularities in the @xmath0plane . a simple and feasible way to approximate this complicated structure is to take the sum of a simple and a double pole ( dipole ) .",
    "the dipole pomeron is known  @xcite to have unique properties since it reproduces itself under unitarization and thus one expects that it can be used also to resolve the abovementioned problem in diffraction dissociation . obviously , the sum of a simple and double pole - like any combination of regge singularities - looses factorizability ,",
    "although each term remains factorizable . since regge pole factorization appears to be in conflict with experimental results  @xcite , the approach we consider is favoured .",
    "the dipole pomeron model has been tested successfully in elastic hadron - hadron and @xmath18hadron reactions  @xcite and an application to single diffractive dissociation has been considered in refs .",
    "it turns out that , in this approach , the pomeron contribution consists of two terms , one increasing like the logarithm of the energy and the other being energy independent , multiplied by `` a priori '' different @xmath19dependent vertex functions .",
    "this feature , and the assumption that the pomeron couples in a different way to pomerons and hadrons , opens the way to a unified treatment of elastic and production amplitudes .    since the inclusive process of hadron diffraction has been discussed extensively in the literature  @xcite we will start , in section 2 , from the mueller discontinuity formula and adapt it to the chosen model .",
    "the triple pomeron contribution will be discussed in detail and the possibility to satisfy the unitarity constraint will be investigated .",
    "while a proof of the proposed solution can not be given in the framework of the regge theory because the @xmath19dependence of the vertices is arbitrary to a great extent , plausibility arguments can be advanced on the basis of dynamical models for the pomeron .",
    "section 3 will be devoted to the inclusion of secondary regge trajectories and the final expression for the cross section will be compared with experimental data in section 4 .",
    "the conclusion of this work will be drawn in section 5 .",
    "consider first the process @xmath20 with the exchange of regge trajectories @xmath21 . from the mueller discontinuity formula  @xcite we get @xmath22 in the usual regge pole model .",
    "@xmath23 is the squared mass of the unrevealed state @xmath24 , @xmath25 represents the regge trajectory exchanged and @xmath26 is its signature . in the following @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 stands for the pomeron trajectory .",
    "consider now the elastic scattering and suppose that , asymptotically , the absorptive part in the @xmath30-channel , @xmath31 , goes like @xmath32~,\\ ] ] then the partial wave amplitude presents a simple and double pole in the complex @xmath0plane . the amplitude for the pomeron exchange can then be written as @xmath33~ , \\label{z2}\\ ] ] where constant terms have been collected in @xmath34 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath35 depends on the model . as an example , in a dual model , if the residue of the simple pole has the form @xmath36 , the residue of the double pole will be given by @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the form of this residue is such that the coefficient of the double pole can vanish for @xmath38 , if this is required from general principles .    to substantiate this possibility",
    ", we can generalize the picture of ref .",
    "@xcite and suppose that the pomeron pole couples to quarks through the exchange of two gluons . in order to describe the gluon - pomeron - gluon vertex we use , at high energy , the rules of covariant reggeization  @xcite for the coupling of the pomeron pole to massive vector mesons , since the gluons are off - shell .",
    "this require the introduction of five unknown functions of @xmath39 ( some of them will vanish because of gauge invariance ) that will appear in the amplitude multiplied by polynomials in @xmath40 and by appropriate powers of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 at high energy and @xmath44 .",
    "the final expression is complicated , but it can be easily seen that there will appear , among the leading contributions @xmath45 , at least one term vanishing when @xmath46 . this property remains true when we integrate over the gluon and quark momenta and , by taking the derivative with respect to @xmath40 , we introduce a double pole for the pomeron .",
    "moreover this result does not depend on the choice of the partonic wave function of the hadron .",
    "the conclusion is that , also in elastic hadron - hadron scattering , the presence of a term vanishing with @xmath39 , together with other terms finite at @xmath38 , is highly probable in the conventional regge residue .",
    "it could well happen that , if we consider the triple pomeron vertex , the unitarity condition will impose constraints on the couplings such that @xmath35 in eq .",

    "hence , a different value of @xmath86 could be required from the experimental data , but this possibility will not be considered in the following .",
    "when comparing the model with experimental data , we find two kinds of problems . the first one is related to the experimental definition of single diffraction dissociation . the great variety of phenomenological models , adopted by different experimental groups in order to extract the published data , makes the test of any new model difficult .",

    "the second kind of problem resides in our parametrization and is strongly related to the first one .",
    "the integrated cross section can not be given in compact form and , since the overall normalization of the data has an experimental uncertainty of 15 % , it is not an easy task to determine the parameter @xmath81 only from the @xmath39-dependence of the cross sections at different energies .    while the pion contribution can be fixed as in section 3 , the parameters relative to the @xmath51 trajectory are different with respect to those of refs .",

    "we have found that our proposed model nicely fits all the data for a large range of values of the parameter @xmath81 larger than 1/2 .",
    "this weak dependence on the value of the parameter @xmath81 was not unexpected , since the fit was performed at fixed @xmath39 . in the particular case of @xmath134 ( which will be justified in the following )",
    "the fit gives for the remaining parameters the following values : @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , with @xmath139 . in fig .",
    "1 we compare the curve resulting from the fit with @xmath134 with the experimental data .",
    "we can see that our model succeeds in reproducing the experimental data at different values of @xmath30 .",
    "we have checked that choosing a different value for @xmath81 produces only little changes of the other parameters , but does not affect in a sizeable way the shape of the fitting curves .",
    "we have then fixed the parameters in the expression for @xmath124 in our model according to the result of the fit at @xmath127 gev@xmath128 and have checked how it reproduces other sets of data , obtained at different @xmath39 values .",
    "we have considered the data of ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath140 gev@xmath128 and those of the ua8 collaboration  @xcite at the relatively large value of @xmath141 gev@xmath128 . in both cases",
    "our curves roughly reproduce the data ( see figs .  2 and 3 ) , thus indicating that also the @xmath19dependence in our model is quite reasonable .",
    "finally , we have considered the total single diffractive cross section @xmath13 , for the process @xmath142 as a function of @xmath143 .",
    "we have compared our model with the experimental data of  @xcite from the compilation given in  @xcite , where some data have been corrected in order to obtain the diffraction cross section for @xmath144 . in order to make the comparison , we have numerically integrated our expression for @xmath124 , with the parameters determined by the previous fit , in the region @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in fig .",
    "4 we observe that the result of the integration , plotted as a function of @xmath147 , is in good agreement with the experimental data over all the range of values of @xmath30 , including the tevatron energies @xmath148 and 1800 gev .",
    "we must stress here that the choice @xmath134 is essential : values of @xmath81 lower than 2 , but larger than 1/2 in order to satisfy @xmath149 , would give a too fast growth with @xmath30 , whereas larger values of @xmath81 would cause an undershooting of the data at large @xmath30 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the proton diffraction dissociation in the dipole pomeron model . in this model",
    "the differential cross section @xmath124 can be written in the form given in eq .",
    "( [ z10 ] ) . from the theoretical point of view , the result in eq .",
    "( [ z10 ] ) assesses two important properties that seem to be required by the data  @xcite .",
    "first , the exact factorization , typical of the regge pole model , is lost in the dipole pomeron approach .",
    "second , for @xmath38 the pomeron and pion contributions are independent of @xmath30 and the scaling with @xmath23 of @xmath150 becomes exact if only these terms are considered .",
    "moreover , we remark that this model respects the unitarity condition without decoupling of the triple pomeron vertex .",
    "the total diffractive cross section rises as @xmath151 , i.e. slower than the total @xmath152 cross section that , in turn , satisfies the froissart bound .",
    "we notice that , in eq .",
    "( [ z10 ] ) , the triple pomeron coupling and the pomeron - proton cross section are tangled in the multiplicative constant @xmath115 together with an unknown scale factorized from the function @xmath35 .",
    "hence the fit of the experimental data can not determine the aforesaid quantities but , at any rate , it represents an important test of the model . concerning the comparison with experimental data",
    ", we have found that this model gives a satisfactory fit to the experimental data for @xmath124 with regards both to the @xmath153 and @xmath19dependence .",
    "moreover , for a suitable choice of the parameter @xmath81 , it well reproduces also the data for the total single diffractive cross section and allows to predict a value of about 11 mb at the lhc energy @xmath125 tev .",
    "we stress that in our model the one - pion contribution , parametrized in eq .",
    "( [ z8 ] ) , has been fixed from the beginning , differently from ref .",
    "@xcite , where a multiplicative constant has been considered in front of it as one of the two free parameters to be fitted . as for the @xmath51 contribution , in our model it is well below the limit found by cdf  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies observed at large @xmath129 from the data of ref .",
    "@xcite and of ua8  @xcite could arise from an underestimation of the contribution of the @xmath90 and from neglecting that of the @xmath28 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the one - pion exchange contribution is only a small part of the total non - pomeron exchange background .",
    "also the approximated treatment of the @xmath51 could be responsible for the disagreement at large @xmath129 . what we need is a more rigorous method for justifying the @xmath39-dependence of our parametrization and an extensive study of non - leading contributions .",
