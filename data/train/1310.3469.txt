    "<S> the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model with tsallis distribution has been used to explain the energy dependence of the product of the moments , @xmath0 and @xmath1 of net - proton multiplicity distributions of recently published star data at rhic energies . while excellent agreements are found between model predictions and measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath2 of most peripheral collisions and @xmath0 of most central collisions , the @xmath2 of most central collisions deviates significantly from the model predictions particularly at @xmath3 gev and @xmath4 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this could be an indication of the presence of additional dynamical fluctuations not contained in the hrg - tsallis model .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the star collaboration has reported the energy dependence of the moments ( mean @xmath5 , variance @xmath6 , skewness @xmath7 and kurtosis @xmath8 ) and their products for net - proton multiplicity distribution at rhic energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the product of the moments @xmath0 and @xmath9 can be linked to the ratios of susceptibilities @xmath10 associated with the baryon number conservation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the product @xmath0 can be written as the ratio of third order ( @xmath11 ) to second order ( @xmath12 ) and the product @xmath9 as the ratio of fourth order ( @xmath13 ) to second order ( @xmath14 ) baryon susceptibilities . </S>",
    "<S> the recent star measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 show significant deviations from the predictions of the skellam distribution ( where @xmath2 should be unity ) at all energies indicating presence of large non - statistical fluctuations @xcite . the particle production in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies </S>",
    "<S> are well described in terms of the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model where fermions and bosons follow fermi - dirac ( fd ) and bose - einstein ( be ) distributions respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the success of hrg model would mean that thermal system which might have gone through a possible phase transition has ( nearly ) equilibrated both thermally and chemically at freeze out . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that if the thermal system has retained some memory of the phase transition with finite correlation length at freeze out , it must be reflected in the higher moments of the conserved quantities although not so obvious in the study of thermal abundance of the individual species  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the study of fluctuations in various conserved quantities like : net - charge , net - strangeness and net - baryon number through the higher moments using hrg model is expected to provide a base line to observe the deviation in experimental observables , which may indicate the presence of non statistical fluctuations , if any .    </S>",
    "<S> the hrg model in boltzmann approximation follows an exponential behavior of particle production corresponding to boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been realized that particle production both in heavy ion and proton - proton collisions at rhic and lhc energies can be described successfully using a power law type distribution rather than the exponential one @xcite . therefore , the tsallis distribution function is being used for particle production with nonextensive parameter @xmath15 such that it approaches boltzmann distribution in the limit @xmath16 . in the context of particle production in heavy ion collisions , tsallis distribution has been interpreted as the superposition of boltzmann distributions with different temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation can occur when the hadronic fireball is not homogeneous in temperature @xmath17 but fluctuates from point to point around some equilibrium value @xmath18  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature fluctuation which exists in small part of the phase space with respect to the whole is another source of non - statistical fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> this is different from the statistical fluctuations of event by event type and should be properly accounted in the model . in general , tsallis nonextensive statistics is supposed to include all situations characterized by long range interactions , long range microscopic memory and space time fractal structure of the process @xcite . therefore , we consider a hadron resonance gas model using tsallis nonextensive distribution to study fluctuations of net - baryon production in au+au collisions at rhic energies . in the limit @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , we recover the hrg results .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the hrg - tsallis model with a temperature dependent nonextensive @xmath15 parameter reproduces the energy dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for most peripheral collisions as well as @xmath0 for central collisions . however , the energy dependence of @xmath1 of central collision deviate significantly from the hrg - tsallis model predictions particularly at energies @xmath19 gev and @xmath4 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we argue here that the predictions of hrg - tsallis characterized by a temperature dependent @xmath15 parameter should be taken as the base line to study ( experimentally ) fluctuations of dynamical origin if any , which is still not contained in the tsallis non - extensive thermodynamics .      @xmath24    where @xmath18 is the chemical freeze - out temperature , @xmath25 is the chemical potential and @xmath26 is the degeneracy factor of the @xmath27 particle . </S>",
    "<S> the total chemical potential @xmath25 = @xmath28 + @xmath29 + @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the baryon , electric charge and strangeness number of the @xmath27 particle , with corresponding chemical potentials @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . the term @xmath37 represents either @xmath38 , @xmath39 or @xmath7 of the @xmath27 particle depending on whether the computed @xmath40 represents baryon density , electric charge density or strangeness density respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the exponent @xmath15 in @xmath41 has been introduced as a constraint for thermodynamical consistency  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath42 can be expressed in terms of phase space variables , @xmath43 where energy @xmath44 is expressed as , @xmath45 . since the average density and the pressure @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> are shown to be thermodynamically consistent i.e. @xmath47 , we can define a generalized susceptibility as , @xmath48}{\\partial \\mu^n}|_t= \\frac{\\partial^{n-1 }   [ n_q(t_f,\\mu ) ] } { \\partial \\mu^{n-1}}. \\label{eq : chi_q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using eq.[nq0 ] and eq.[eq : chi_q ] , we have estimated @xmath0 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath50 ) for net - baryon density within star detector acceptance . for comparison with experiments , it would have been more appropriate to estimate net - proton density which includes primordial as well as yields from resonance decays . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have noticed from an earlier study that within star acceptance , the difference between two methods are negligible ( less than @xmath51 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the present study we consider net - baryon density within star acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> we parametrized the freeze - out temperatures and chemical potentials using the relations , @xmath52= @xmath53 and @xmath54 = a - b@xmath55 - c@xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are taken from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for most central collision and are listed in table  [ tab : mut_cent ] . for peripheral collision </S>",
    "<S> , we extract these parameters from star preliminary data @xcite for most peripheral ( 70 - 80)% centrality collisions and the extracted parameters are listed in table  [ tab : mut_peri ] . </S>",
    "<S> we use similar parametrization for @xmath57 and @xmath58 as that of @xmath59 and the corresponding parameters are listed in the table . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath58 to zero for peripheral collision as its contribution is very small as compared to @xmath59 and @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - extensive parameter @xmath15 characterizes the degree of non - equilibrium in the system which depends on both collision energy as well as on the centrality of collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath15 depends on @xmath18 , @xmath60 as well as on the type of identified particles @xcite . from the previous study of star data </S>",
    "<S> , it is noticed that @xmath15 value decreases with increasing centrality indicating an evolution from a highly non - equilibrated system towards a more thermalized one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that @xmath61 has a parabolic dependence on temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , from the analysis of sps and rhic data , it is noticed that @xmath15 value is maximum at sps energy of 80 @xmath62gev ( which corresponds to 12.3 gev in center of mass energy ) and decreases on either side i.e. at 158 @xmath62gev as well as at 40 @xmath62gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 value is also found nearly unity at 200 gev rhic energy . in term of freeze out temperature , </S>",
    "<S> these two observations suggest that the @xmath15 parameter may have a maximum value at a particular temperature @xmath63 and will decrease on either side . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum temperature @xmath63 is fixed at @xmath64 gev corresponding to the freeze out temperature ( for central collision ) at @xmath65=12.3 gev which corresponds to 80 @xmath62gev sps collision energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we use the parametrization @xmath66^{1/2}$ ] for @xmath67 and allow it to decrease to unity linearly with a slope @xmath68 for @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the @xmath15 value at @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath71 for @xmath72 . in the above </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath73 is a reference temperature fixed at @xmath74 gev which is close to the freeze - out temperature for @xmath75 gev so that @xmath71 for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath77 is taken @xmath78 gev corresponding to @xmath79 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in fig.[fig1 ] , shows a typical dependence of @xmath15 on freeze - out temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath80 is kept free and is adjusted to fit the data . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath81 ( @xmath16 ) , we get back the hrg results . </S>",
    "<S> note that we use the same parametrization irrespective of whether the collision is central or peripheral except different centrality will have different chemical freeze - out parameters .     and @xmath1 of net - baryon distribution calculated using standard hrg ( solid curve ) and tsallis - hrg with @xmath82 ( dotted curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the filled circles are star data points for most peripheral collision corresponding to @xmath83 collision centrality in au+au collisions @xcite . the bottom panel shows the ratio of data and our model calculation for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> the filled circles are star data points for most central collision corresponding to @xmath85 collision centrality in au+au collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom panel shows the ratio of data to model calculation for @xmath0 only . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1 ] , shows the energy dependence of @xmath0 ( top panel ) and @xmath1 ( middle panel ) estimated using parameters as listed in table [ tab : mut_peri ] for most peripheral ( 70 - 80)% centrality collisions . as can be seen , the hrg results ( @xmath80 = 0 ) do not explain the experimental values @xcite , and @xmath1 in hrg model is always close to unity where as data points are about @xmath86 below the hrg values . on the other hand , hrg - tsallis with a nominal @xmath82 ( corresponds to a maximum @xmath15 value of @xmath87 ) can explain both @xmath0 and @xmath1 extremely well . the excellent agreement between data and model predictions </S>",
    "<S> can be seen from the ratio plot in the bottom panel of fig.[fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding results for most central ( 0 - 5)% centrality collisions are shown in fig.[fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> also for the central collisions , the hrg predictions do not explain the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to note that @xmath82 explains energy dependence of @xmath0 rather well except at @xmath88 gev ( although small , the disagreement between measurement and prediction for @xmath0 is also found for peripheral collisions at @xmath88 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the model fails to explain @xmath1 as the deviations are more significant for lower energy data ( @xmath89 39 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have also increased @xmath80 from @xmath90 to @xmath91 which results in the dashed - dot curves in fig.[fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> although use of a higher @xmath80 parameter can explain the general energy dependence of @xmath1 , it fails to explain the @xmath0 data . in short , </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to explain both @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously by varying @xmath80 .    in the frame work of tsallis </S>",
    "<S> non - extensive thermodynamics , the definition of generalized susceptibility as defined in eq.[eq : chi_q ] can be interpreted as follows . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath92(x ) which is true when @xmath15 is close to 1 ( maximum @xmath15 value used in this work is about @xmath87 ) , the tsallis - boltzmann distribution eq.[eq : tsallis ] can be written as superposition of boltzmann distribution and the average baryon number density as @xmath93 where the weight factor @xmath94 represents a gamma distribution as defined in @xcite and @xmath95 is the average number density obtained using boltzmann statistics . using above relation , </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : chi_q ] can be expressed as weighted sum of the susceptibilities estimated using standard boltzmann statistics and can be interpreted as an average taken over the whole phase space which is inhomogeneous in temperature . </S>",
    "<S> probably , this is what will be measured experimentally if the temperature fluctuation exists in the hadronizing medium corresponding to a nonextensive value of @xmath15 which deviates from unity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is reasonable to argue that eq.[eq : chi_q ] can be used to estimate temperature average higher moments . it may be mentioned here that the above argument is strictly correct when quantum statistics is not important and tsallis distribution can be written as the superposition of boltzmann distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this is mostly true for baryons where quantum statistics are not important .    </S>",
    "<S> it may be mentioned here that , we have not considered the van der waals ( vdw ) type excluded volume effect which could be another source of deviation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the hrg predictions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the vdw type deviation increases with decreasing energies where as the star experimental values have maximum deviation at @xmath3 gev and less deviation at the two lowest rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have not considered vdw type effect in the present calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the transport model like urqmd within star acceptance also produces similar results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 which decrease with decreasing energies . in the frame work of grand canonical hrg model , the @xmath96-@xmath97 order cumulant for net - proton density </S>",
    "<S> can be written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the @xmath96-@xmath97 cumulants for proton and anti - proton respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same expression which has been used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite except for the fact that proton and anti - proton productions are independent . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath99 and @xmath100 are taken from the experiments , it is not surprising that the independent production model explains the star data . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the hrg model , the proton and anti - proton productions are not independent rather constraints through baryon number conservation . </S>",
    "<S> further , we would like to add here that the present hrg - tsallis model is different from the grand canonical hrg model as @xmath101 in our model represents a weighted average over the distribution of temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the primary motivation of the star measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath2 is to look for the existence of a critical end point in the qcd phase diagram where the product of these moments may show large non monotonic variations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the tsallis distribution also includes quantum effect which is important at lower collision energies . therefore , in this work we explored , how much non - statistical fluctuations inherently present in the tsallis non - extensive distribution , which can explain the experimental observations without considering other physics effects .    </S>",
    "<S> another important aspect which has not been considered here is the effect of non - extensivity on the freeze - out parameters which are generally extracted from the experiments using hrg model . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed in ref.@xcite that while freeze - out temperature decreases , chemical potential increases with increasing @xmath15 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath102 which has been used in the present study , we notice that the increase in @xmath59 is not significant although @xmath18 decreases by about @xmath103 from the value when @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> as argued in @xcite , since tsallis distribution is broader than the boltzmann distribution , temperature needs to be decreased in order to conserve the particle density . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have estimated the moments keeping @xmath59 unchanged but allowing freeze - out temperature to decrease up to @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we notice that while @xmath0 increases slightly , @xmath104 remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that @xmath0 is sensitive to both temperature and chemical potential while @xmath2 is sensitive to @xmath15 parameter .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the energy dependence of the fluctuations of net - baryon productions through higher moments namely @xmath0 and @xmath1 using hrg with tsallis non - extensive distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> when the non - extensive parameter @xmath15 is close to unity , the moments obtained using hrg - tsallis model can be interpreted as the weighted average of the moments estimated using many boltzmann distribution corresponding to the distribution of temperatures over the whole phase space . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this hrg - tsallis model can explain the energy dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 measurements of recently published star data corresponding to the most peripheral collisions which is otherwise impossible to explain using normal hrg model which predicts @xmath1 close to unity for net - baryon productions . </S>",
    "<S> the hrg - tsallis model also explains the energy dependence of @xmath105 data of central collision . </S>",
    "<S> however , the model can not explain the corresponding @xmath104 values of the central collision particularly at energies @xmath19 gev and @xmath4 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this deviation is so significant that it is an indication of the presence of additional fluctuations at around @xmath106 gev which may have some dynamical origin not contained in the tsallis hrg model .    </S>",
