    "the stellar winds of early - type stars are thought to be driven by radiation pressure on spectral lines .",
    "predictions of wind properties are usually tested by comparing them to @xmath0  & @xmath1  values derived for a set of about 30 well studied galactic and magellanic cloud o and early - b stars ( puls et al .",
    "although it has proven challenging enough to match predictions with observations , these stars provide only a limited test .",
    "to better constrain wind theory one should confront a wider range of predictions with observations .",
    "meaningful new tests include extending the comparisons of @xmath0  and @xmath1  to : _",
    "i ) _ extremely luminous of and wn5h-6h stars ; _ ii ) _ stars at ( both sides of ) the bistability jump , an abrupt discontinuity in @xmath1  found to occur at spectral type b1 , and _",
    "iii ) _ luminous blue variables .",
    "we have applied our predictions of mass loss to all the above cases with excellent results ( de koter et al .",
    "1997 ; vink et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "as the properties of stellar winds depend also on stellar mass , an alternative test would be to compare masses derived from line - driven wind theory with those of independent methods .",
    "this is a relevant issue in view of current problems with masses based on mass - loss rates and terminal wind velocities .",
    "= 7.2 cm    although some wind properties ( of o stars ) are almost mass independent , such as the modified wind momentum @xmath2 , the mass loss itself behaves as @xmath3 ( vink et al .",
    "so , in principle , the mass may be derived when all relevant stellar properties  including @xmath0  & @xmath1  ",
    "are known .",
    "so far , attempts to derive @xmath4 from wind theory yielded systematically lower masses ( up to tens of percent ) than those derived from evolutionairy tracks , but appeared to be in agreement with spectroscopic mass determinations ( e.g. herrero et al .",
    "2001 ) .    using the latest generation of model atmospheres ( see herrero this proceedings ) the spectroscopic masses , however , now appear to be in much better agreement with @xmath5 . also , direct mass determinations using spectroscopic binaries ( e.g. massey et al .",
    "2002 ) seem to favor evolutionairy masses .",
    "this would leave the wind masses as the exception . however , here we present evidence that also our mass - loss predictions favor @xmath5 .",
    "the figure shows a consistency check between predicted surface escape velocity @xmath6^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath7 implied by the stellar parameters .",
    "@xmath8 is the eddington factor for electron scattering .",
    "the prediction involves the observed mass loss and terminal wind velocity , i.e. @xmath9 . the case for the evolutionairy masses is shown using asterisk symbols ; `` old '' spectroscopic masses ( in agreement with previous attempts to derive masses from wind theory ) have triangle symbols .",
    "the mean ratio for @xmath5 ( dotted line ) is @xmath10 ; for @xmath11 ( dashed line ) it is @xmath12 .",
    "this shows that within the error our predicted wind properties are in agreement with evolutionairy masses , bringing also the masses from wind theory in accord with those derived from all other mass determination methods .",
