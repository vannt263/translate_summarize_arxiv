    ", the question remains largely unresolved .",
    "this is particularly true for the @xmath3 absorption line systems ; these absorbers can be detected at relatively low redshifts ( @xmath4 ) in the optical spectra of quasars , so understanding their origin has been a more tractable problem for modern instrumentation , as we now discuss .",
    "initial follow - up imaging and spectroscopy of galaxies in the fields of quasars known to show  absorption confirmed the association of strong ( with rest - equivalent width @xmath5 ) intervening systems with galaxies whose luminosities are in the range @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a clear picture connecting absorbers and galaxies has yet to emerge @xcite .",
    "much progress has been made in characterizing the properties of absorption line systems from studying the spectra of large numbers of qsos discovered in wide - area sky surveys @xcite .",
    "following on from the earliest analysis of the redshift distribution of absorption lines @xcite it is now well documented that the cosmic density of absorbers per unit redshift and unit rest - equivalent width , as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , follows an exponential distribution @xcite , but how this distribution is related to the association of absorption lines with galaxies , is unknown .",
    "recent statistical analyses reveal that strong   systems are dusty @xcite and that the dust - to - gas ratio of moderate redshift systems is consistent with local interstellar material ( ism ) values ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but may be substantially lower at higher redshifts @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the gas composition of such systems is not considerably different from solar values @xcite .",
    "there are recent indications that strong systems are associated with star formation activity @xcite yet the nature of this connection is not well understood .    despite the recent progress in the phenomenology of intervening absorption systems , little",
    "is known with confidence about the physical state and origin of the gas ( * ? ? ?",

    "different models attribute the absorption to either galactic winds [ e.g. , @xcite ] , or to cool clumps condensing out from the virialized gaseous halos of galaxies [ e.g. , @xcite ] related , perhaps , to infalling material @xcite .",
    "alternative explanations relate some systems to gravitationally bound minihalos @xcite or to galaxy disks @xcite . while some models are qualitatively consistent with some observational constraints [ e.g. , @xcite ] , many of the recently discovered statistical properties of  systems have not been addressed by theoretical works , and the following questions remain : what is the origin of strong metal systems ?",
    "what sets their observational signatures",
    "? how do they relate to galactic and intergalactic medium ( igm ) processes ?",
    "in this we attempt to shed light on some of those questions by establishing a firmer connection between strong intervening systems and star forming galactic disks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 qualitatively argues for a kennicutt - schmidt like star formation law @xcite for strong intervening  systems . a more quantitative approach is taken in  3 where a phenomenological model is formulated , which links the properties of star - forming galaxies to those of absorbers .",
    "the results of our model fits to the observations are outlined in  4 .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the study of strong intervening systems and galaxy disks across cosmic time in  5 .",
    "a summary follows in  6 .",
    "perhaps the best known property of star forming galaxy disks is that they obey the kennicutt - schmidt law for star formation @xcite whereby the star formation rate per unit area scales with the mean column density of the disk to some power .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism behind this phenomenological scaling is not fully understood and considerable theoretical and observational effort has been invested in identifying its origin @xcite .",
    "recent spectroscopic observations reveal that many star forming galaxies give rise to outflows of cool gas from their centers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a relation exists between the outflow velocity and the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "the physical nature of such outflows and their prevalence in the galaxy population as a whole , are currently poorly constrained .",
    "nevertheless , it has been suggested that such outflows can provide the necessary negative feedback effects that determine and maintain the observed star formation rates observed in galaxies @xcite , and as a means for enriching the igm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as mentioned above , there is mounting evidence that strong  absorbers ( @xmath9 ) are connected to star formation activity and , as such , could be related to the gaseous outflows associated with it @xcite . here",
    "we argue that strong  absorbers _ are _ , in fact , star forming galactic disks and their associated outflows . to this end",
    "we note two observationally robust scalings : the relation between the ( geometric ) mean  column density of strong  absorbers and @xmath7 such that @xcite , @xmath10 and the relation between the ( maximum ) velocity of galactic winds , @xmath11 , and the star formation rate ( sfr , denoted by @xmath12 ) such that @xmath13 here , @xmath14 for  lines @xcite and @xmath15 for   lines , as statistically estimated from the stacked spectra of a sample of star - forming deep2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "to clarify we note that @xmath16 does not necessarily mean that  ions travel faster than  ions and that it may be that observational effects , such as optical depth or partial filling by emission are important @xcite .",
    "here we assume , with little justification at this stage , that outflow kinematics are responsible for the line broadening of strong systems .",
    "in particular , we consider a case in which the rest equivalent width of strong  troughs and the velocities of outflows are related by @xmath17 this proportionality between the kinematic broadening and @xmath7 is justified for strong  systems whose absorption troughs are saturated , and @xmath7 mirrors the velocity dispersion of the gas . since @xmath11 is a measure of the outflow velocity towards the center of a galaxy , we add the proportionality factor of 2 to account for a background object sightline intercepting both the receding and advancing sides of a symmetric outflow ( see fig .",
    "[ pic ] ) .",
    "this model neglects the contribution of infalling material [ e.g. , cool filaments or galactic fountains @xcite ] whose covering factor is expected to be small @xcite and the velocity spread moderate .",
    "it also neglects contribution to the velocity field from galactic rotation which is expected to be small for thin disks , as determined from current data @xcite .",
    "inclination effects will be treated in  3 .    combining the above , seemingly unrelated , relations for @xmath18 and @xmath19 using equation [ w0 ]",
    ", we obtain an expression relating the sfr to the  column density , with the following form : @xmath20 this relationship between the sfr of a  host galaxy and the  column density of the absorbing gas , qualitatively has the same functional form as the kennicutt - schmidt law for star formation in galaxies @xcite .",
    "an analogous scaling is obtained if , instead of using equation [ nhi ] , one uses the relation between the dust column density and @xmath7 found by @xcite due to intervening systems dust and @xmath7 are related such that @xmath21 . assuming the reddening is a proxy for the dust column and a constant dust - to - gas ratio , a completely analogous relation to equation [ nhi ] is obtained . ] .",
    "let us now crudely estimate a kennicutt - schmidt relation from equation [ sk0 ] : we recall that @xmath5  systems are thought to be associated with @xmath22 galaxies @xcite , whose disk radius we take to be @xmath23kpc [ qualitatively consistent with the relation reported by @xcite ] .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate for the star formation surface density is therefore @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 ) .",
    "we hence obtain a surprisingly good match with the galactic kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the uncertainties on the proportionality factor in this relation are large : for example , if the typical galactic disk radius giving rise to strong systems is only 3kpc large ( as would be the case if the hosts of most strong systems are fainter ; see below ) then the kennicutt - schmidt law obeyed by absorbers implies a higher star formation rate for the same  column density compared to galaxies .",
    "we return to these important issues when considering a more quantitative version of this relation in  5.8 .    obtaining the form of the kennicutt - schmidt law by combining pure",
    "absorber and galaxy phenomenology raises the interesting possibility that ( a ) sight - lines through most strong  absorbers probe star forming disks [ as opposed to e.g. , condensed halo gas ; @xcite ] and that ( b ) the broadening of  troughs is largely due to disk wind kinematics rather than , for example , the velocity dispersion of absorbing clouds in galactic halos or the rotation speed of gas in galactic disks .",
    "this intimate absorber - disk association also naturally explains the large column densities associated with strong intervening systems , which are comparable to those observed through disks .",
    "it also explains the high dust - to - gas ratios in those systems @xcite , as well as their association with star forming regions .",
    "if most strong  systems probe galaxy disks then their statistical properties should be accounted for by those of galaxies . in particular , the exponential density distribution of such absorption systems as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath26 should be describable by the following expression , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . ] : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the redshift - dependent luminosity function , @xmath32 is the minimum ( maximum ) luminosity of galaxies that give rise to strong  systems , and @xmath33 is the luminosity and redshift - dependent geometrical cross - section for detecting a  absorption around a galaxy of luminosity @xmath34 . @xmath35 if the probability of detecting a system with a rest equivalent width @xmath7 around a galaxy of luminosity @xmath34 ] .",
    "this probability may be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the probability of having a certain sfr , @xmath12 , for galaxy of luminosity @xmath34 , and @xmath39 is the probability of having a certain @xmath7 - i.e. , outflow velocity - for a galaxy with a star formation rate @xmath12 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that there are no hidden correlations among the various variables apart from those explicitly stated here . whether this holds in realistic systems",
    "is unclear , but assessing the degree to which any hidden correlations may change our results is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the model defined above seeks to connect the observable properties of absorbers to those of their host galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the properties of galaxies and absorption line systems are well measured only over particular redshift intervals , and these intervals do not always overlap .",
    "the properties of galaxies are best understood at very low redshift , but the characteristics of uv absorption line systems have been determined largely at intermediate and high redshift . for example , as we shall see below , faint galaxies have a potentially important contribution to the cosmic density of strong systems and their properties are known only locally .",
    "we can therefore proceed in one of two ways : we can ( a ) extrapolate the local properties of ( faint ) galaxies to higher redshifts , or ( b ) extrapolate the properties of absorbers to low redshifts .",
    "the first approach requires the extrapolation of the locally determined galaxy luminosity function , @xmath40 to higher @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast , the second approach requires only that we extrapolate @xmath42 to low redshifts .",
    "furthermore , with the installation of the _ cosmic origin spectrograph _ ( cos ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , the properties of low redshift absorption lines are likely to be determined ( at least for @xmath5  systems ) in the near future .",
    "conversely , many of the properties of faint galaxies at high redshifts are likely to remain uncertain for some time .    with the above in mind",
    ", we restrict our analysis to @xmath43 and will henceforth drop the @xmath44dependence from our derived values and distributions ( we return to the effects of redshift evolution in  5.5 ) . specifically , we take a schechter form for the luminosity function of galaxies that give rise to metal absorption systems @xmath45 we adopt the parameterization of @xcite who carried out a census of star - forming galaxies in the local universe , and found : @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , with @xmath49 being the solar luminosity ) .",
    "we note that this particular parameterization for the luminosity function of galaxies is one out of many , and somewhat different , parameter values are reported in the literature depending on the selection criteria and filter used @xcite .",
    "as we do not know whether all star - forming disk galaxies give rise to  systems , we define @xmath50 to be the fraction of galaxies that cause  absorption and allow it to be smaller than unity .",
    "we neglect a possible dependence of @xmath50 on the galaxy luminosity .",
    "we take @xmath51 implying that the model considers all galaxies with luminosity , @xmath52 as contributing to the population of  absorbers .",
    "it turns out that , due to the exponentially small number of very luminous galaxies , the particular @xmath53 chosen has little effect on the predicted number density of @xmath54  absorbers .",
    "that said , the particular choice of @xmath53 may affect model predictions concerning the number density of the strongest systems , which are rare and their statistics rather poorly determined .",
    "the cross - section for  absorption from galaxy disks , @xmath55 [ with @xmath56 being the effective radius of the absorbing region ] , is unknown , as is its dependence on galaxy luminosity .",
    "we assume that this cross - section scales with that of the  disk , @xmath57 , as deduced from 21 cm emission down to a column density limit of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "we therefore define @xmath59 with @xmath60 being of order unity , which is qualitatively consistent with the observed local scaling of  disk cross - sections [ see fig .",

    "to summarize , our model thus far relies on observable properties of star - forming galaxies with only two quantities , @xmath69 and @xmath63 , both poorly constrained by observations and left as free parameters whose values will be determined by a fit to absorption line data .",
    "it is , currently , not well determined how inclination affects the observable properties of a galaxy outflow and any attempt to _ directly _ account for it in our model is subject to large uncertainties . while it is unlikely that an outflow is spherically symmetric , the details are obscure both observationally and theoretically [ for a very recent work providing new insights into inclination issues see @xcite ] .",
    "that said , our model is unlikely to be considerably affected by such uncertainties since we use the _ observationally _ determined statistical properties of outflows from spectroscopic surveys of star forming galaxies .",
    "such studies probe galaxies with a broad range of inclinations to our sight line , hence the effects of inclination already appears in the data and enter our model , by definition , via @xmath65 .",

    "the notion that strong  systems are material in and outflowing from galaxy disks is also consistent with the recent findings of @xcite indicating that the magnetic fields associated with strong systems are comparable to galactic values .",

    "in fact , in our model , the physics of strong intervening  systems is exactly that of the ism , which is ( at least initially ) gravitationally bound and enriched by stars in its environment .",

    "as demonstrated above , a broad range of galaxy luminosities gives rise to strong  absorption .",
    "for @xmath140  systems , the galaxies which give rise to the absorption have luminosities @xmath161 .",

    "it may therefore be challenging to identify the galaxy which directly hosts the absorber , since it could be outshone by the nearby quasar .",
    "in such cases only bright hosts or neighboring galaxies that are clustered around the true host may be detected ( provided they are bright enough and far enough from the quasar sight line ) .",
    "given the predictions of our model , a better approach to studying the origin of @xmath164  systems at high redshifts is to use @xmath60-ray bursts ( grbs ) as background sources rather than quasars [ e.g. , @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "with this technique , deep images of the fields obtained after the grb light has faded is more likely to reveal fainter galaxies , even when the grb host galaxy is also present @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a comprehensive study of absorption lines arising from very low redshift galaxies could be used to test the predictions of our model .",
    "although hst is required to record spectra of uv lines at @xmath43 , nearby galaxies probed by quasar sightlines can be selected a priori by the same properties studied in our model , such as their luminosity , morphology , star formation rate , etc .",
    "probing a significant number of galaxies with a range of these properties would enable us to map the distribution of metal line properties directly .",
    "the installation of cos aboard hst , with a sensitivity higher than the spectrographs previously available on the satellite , now makes a large survey possible .",
    "our model gives specific predictions for the statistical relations between the absorber properties ( namely , @xmath7 ) and its host galaxy properties ( such as @xmath12 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "nevertheless , judging from figure [ chi2 ] , the allowed parameter space in which there is good agreement between our model and the available  data , is large . in this section",
    "we therefore focus on a small subset of all models whose parameterizations are given in table [ tab ] , and all provide equally good fits to the data ( specifically , all models trace the dashed black curve in fig . [ dndw ] ) .",
    "this set of models which we label a , b , and c , is consistent with the notion that galaxies much fainter than @xmath165 contribute little to the cross - section for @xmath5  systems .",

    "statistically , however , the number counts of strong systems can be fully accounted for by star - forming galaxies alone .",

    "nevertheless , the exact numbers depend on the particular model chosen , as can be seen by comparing models a , b , and c. for example , models b and c give very different predictions for the star - formation rate distribution of @xmath170  hosts such that , for model c , a considerable fraction of hosts have @xmath173 while , for model b , galaxies with @xmath174 can substantially contribute to the number of such systems .",
    "the different predictions in each case imply that reliable measurements of the @xmath175 distributions will constrain the model .",

    "this fact is consistent with our findings , although a more quantitative comparison awaits secure identifications of galaxies in those fields .",
    "our model implies that surveys which first select host galaxies according to their luminosity and star formation rates , and then study absorption through their disks , would see a broad range of absorber properties at any given luminosity and sfr bin .",
    "for example , a faint dwarf with @xmath178 is likely to give rise to an absorber with @xmath179 .",
    "however , the chances of a very bright galaxy , @xmath180 giving rise to the same @xmath7 are also considerable ( see fig . [ dist ] ) .",
    "this may be the reason for the scarcity of clear relations between galaxy and absorber properties ( in addition to uncertainties related to the identification of the true host ) .",
    "the model is qualitatively consistent with the recent findings of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and which are further discussed in  5.6 .",
    "our results highlight the need for large samples of quasar - galaxy pairs , which would overcome the large scatter in galaxy - absorber properties and help to reveal the underlying galaxy - absorber association .",
    "the findings presented here are consistent with the notion that most large - scale galaxy - absorber associations , where the impact parameter is much larger than the  disk size of the true host galaxy , arise from galaxy - galaxy clustering .",

    "this allows us to calculate the mean  absorption line profile that would be observed against the galactic continuum for an ensemble of galaxies ( e.g. , with a given star formation rate ) by stacking their individual ( predicted ) spectra .",
    "specifically , using the luminosity function of galaxies and their star - formation probability distributions , we created a mock catalog of galaxies and their associated absorbers according to the modeling scheme of  3 .",
    "an absorption spectrum for each galaxy was then constructed under the assumption that the absorption trough is saturated and that the outflow fully covers the uv emitting disk [ but see @xcite ] .",
    "this means that we approximate the absorption line profile , as would be seen along a single sight line through a disk , as a rectangle centered at the systemic velocity of the galaxy . the mean line profile for a sample of galaxies , with some given properties ,",
    "was then calculated by taking the mean flux at every photon energy of all spectra .",
    "this procedure is qualitatively similar to that carried out by @xcite for deep2 data . to allow comparison with the @xcite results , we calculated @xmath232 , the velocity at which 75% of the flux is transmitted through the blue wing of the ( mean ) line profile , as a function of the sfr of the galaxies .",
    "the resulting line profiles are shown in figure [ wei ] .",
    "the shape of the predicted line profile , as would be observed along sight lines to background objects that pierce through intervening disks , is characterized by a deep trough at the systemic velocity of the galaxy with symmetrically extended blue and red wings .",
    "the shape of the mean line profile is not determined by optical depth effects  individual systems are saturated by construction  but rather by effective partial covering effects when averaging over the full sample of galaxies .",
    "this comes about from the fact that some systems in the ensemble have high velocity absorption components while others do not . in the latter case",
    "the unattenuated continuum contributes to the mean line profile .",
    "this predicts saturated mean absorption line troughs that do not reach a flux level of zero , consistent with the @xmath233 doublet ratio reported by @xcite for their mean line profiles ( note that our modeled absorption line profiles are not convolved with the instrumental line spread function hence the black troughs at the systemic velocity ) .",
    "the exact velocity up to which the line profile extends is not very sensitive to the chosen parameterization ( solid line models in fig .",
    "[ wei ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , for one of our runs , we assumed that the uv emitting region is of radius @xmath234 , i.e. , smaller than the size of the  disk . in this case",
    "only the outflow kinematics within @xmath150 will contribute to the formation of the mean line profile ( magenta line in fig .",
    "[ wei ] ) .",
    "models in which the outflow kinematics varies across the disk ( e.g. , model b ) result in the absorption trough extending to much higher velocities .",
    "more quantitatively , for model b , we find that , for @xmath235 ( @xmath236 ) , @xmath237 ( @xmath238 ) , which is consistent with the results of @xcite for  winds ( see fig . [ wei ] ) .",
    "results for models a , b , and c for which the uv emitting surface is the entire disk or the wind velocity is constant across the disk , seem to under - predict the observed characteristic outflow velocities .",
    "our results imply that galaxies with a relatively low sfr , will show only low to moderate velocity outflows @xcite .    when observed at high spectral resolution",
    ", strong intervening systems often show several discrete absorption components , implying that the absorbing medium is clumpy . drawing from the apparent correspondence between intervening  systems and galactic winds",
    ", this may indicate that galactic winds are largely clumpy and that their structure is characterized by clouds and filaments .",
    "some support for this notion comes from  studies of winds in star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , a highly complex density structure may be expected in such dense and dynamically evolving environments due to the development of various instabilities ( e.g. , kelvin - helmholtz ) as the winds accelerate and expand @xcite .",
    "conversely , the physical picture of galactic outflows naturally explains the rich line profile phenomenology of intervening systems : in this picture , the rich multi - component absorption that characterizes intervening systems is mostly due to ( hydro- ) dynamical effects related to outflow physics and is not related to the clustering of halos .",
    "one way to test and refine our model would be compare the absorption line profiles of galactic winds , as observed toward the centers of star - forming disks , with those seen toward background objects whose sight lines pierce through the disks of the same galaxies .",
    "even more revealing would be to find background objects behind star - forming galaxies and use their spectra to constrain the small scale physics of galactic winds , which is not accessible for studies using the galaxy itself as a background on accounts of the large emitting area @xcite .",
    "several authors have found indications for evolution in the number density of intervening systems as a function of redshift @xcite .",

    "evolution effects seem to be more pronounced for strong absorbers and the number of such systems decreases from high redshifts to present times [ see , however , @xcite who find that the number density of @xmath99  systems actually increases from high redshift to @xmath239 .",

    "it is therefore natural to ask what our model predicts for the redshift evolution of @xmath8 given the evolution in the properties of galaxies over cosmic time .    in its present form",
    ", our model does not include evolutionary effects and additional assumptions are required to incorporate them into the formalism if any comparison is to be made with data relevant to absorption line systems at high-@xmath41 . as noted in  3 , the properties of low luminosity star - forming galaxies are poorly determined at high redshifts . nevertheless , using a specific set of assumptions we can check whether our model is consistent with observations .",
    "we rely on the recent work of @xcite who find that the schechter luminosity function provides an adequate description of galaxy statistics at high-@xmath41 , and give values for @xmath240 and @xmath22 for several redshift intervals . due to the slope of the faint end of the high-@xmath41 luminosity function being difficult to determine due to incompleteness , we hold @xmath66 fixed at the local value .",

    "some support for our simplified approach may be gained from the findings of @xcite who found that the luminosity - dependent cross - section ( or radius ) of galaxies does not evolve with redshift in the range @xmath246 , in agreement with the theoretical expectations of @xcite .",
    "if the characteristic sfr of an @xmath22 galaxy is identified , on average , with its luminosity , at any epoch @xcite , then the predicted global star formation rate density of the universe , @xmath247 , based on our parameterization for the luminosity function evolution with redshift , is consistent with current measurements ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , while the amplitude of the signal for @xmath258  systems is matched by the model , the model seems to over - predict the signal for @xmath259  by @xmath260% and that for @xmath255  by @xmath146% . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the statistics of @xmath255  systems is poor and quantifying the systematics that affect the @xmath251 measurement is challenging .",
    "it is therefore possible that the true number density of such systems is actually higher than reported in their work .",
    "whether this can account for the entire difference between the @xmath251 predicted by model b and the observations is unknown .",
    "alternatively , our model , whose normalization relies on extrapolated data from high-@xmath41 measurements , may be inaccurate .",

    ", we arrive to a somewhat different parameterization than our model b , which we term as model b1 , with @xmath262kpc and with all other parameters held fixed at their model b values .",
    "this model shown in solid line traces well the shape and amplitude of the observed signal for a broad range of @xmath250 .",

    "using model b1 to match the @xmath249 data of @xcite over a broad redshift range provides us with a refined estimate for @xmath261 which is characterized by a lower density of the strongest systems that suffer from the most pronounced evolutionary effects at low redshifts ; see figure [ dndw ] .",
    "as already noted in  3 , predictions for @xmath261 are expected to show deviations from a pure exponential for models of type b in which @xmath263 . studying the shape of @xmath264 as a function of redshift shows that this is indeed the case and that the contribution of relatively faint galaxies to the high @xmath7-end of the distribution is most pronounced at @xmath95 , occurring for @xmath265  systems where the contribution of the relatively rare star - forming systems is small . at higher redshifts",
    "the deviation from a powerlaw is less pronounced yet may be possible to detect even at @xmath212 provided the statistics of @xmath266  systems may be determined to better than @xmath267% . for comparison we also plot a version of our model a with @xmath268 and all other parameters fixed at their model a values .",
    "this model provides a good fit to the data sets described above ( aside from the @xcite results ;  5.4 ) but does not show deviation from an exponential decay in @xmath264 even at large @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , a test for the connection between outflows from star - forming disks and strong intervening systems would be to check for deviations from an exponential at high @xmath7 values at high redshifts and compare those to the mean   absorption troughs observed toward star - forming galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , any proper comparison between the data and the model requires a good understanding of potential systematics , such as dust extinction , that are expected to be more important at small impact parameters from galaxy centers , and which would select against detecting high @xmath7 systems .",
    "if this model is correct then by measuring the density of absorbers over a broad redshift range one may be able to measure @xmath247 in a way which is complementary to that accomplished by studying the emission characteristics of star - forming regions .",
    "in fact , better measurement of @xmath269 may provide interesting constraints on the sfr history of the universe and help constrain the physical model proposed here .",
    "it is , however , important to stress that , in order to be able to provide robust star formation density measurements , the physics of galaxies and their associated outflows needs to be better understood .",
    "alternatively , should @xmath247 be estimated by other means , it may be possible to investigate the physics of bright as well as faint galaxies , in terms of their outflows and disk sizes , up to the highest possible redshifts ( so long as a bright background object is present ) thereby evading the limitations plaguing emission - based studies .",
    "several studies have aimed to measure the star formation rate associated with intervening absorption line systems @xcite . in some studies ,",
    "only upper limits for the star formation rates of host galaxies were obtained , while in other , lower bounds were measured due to contamination by the quasar light , finite fiber or slit sizes , and dust extinction ( assuming that the true host galaxy had been detected ) . in a few cases , integral field unit ( ifu ) observations were obtained leading to more reliable estimates for the sfr associated with strong systems .",
    "we have used our model b1 at various redshifts , as defined above , to calculate the sfr distributions as a function of @xmath7 . in particular , the results for a run of our model with @xmath270 absorber - galaxy pairs are shown in figure [ bouche ] where although most absorbing systems are associated with low star - forming galaxies , the scatter is large and a high star - formation tail is observed .",
    "this behavior is reflected in the large difference between the median and the mean of the sfr ( as calculated from a run of our model b1 with @xmath271 absorber - galaxy systems ) especially for @xmath5  absorbers .",
    "a clear trend is seen whereby the mean or median sfr increases with @xmath7 .",
    "the mean and median values are also plotted for higher redshift models .",
    "these sfrs show a slight increase with @xmath41 .",
    "below , we discuss some of the datasets used to derive sfrs at different redshifts , and examine how consistent they are with our models .",
    "measurements of the star formation rate for individual systems with known @xmath7 have been reported by @xcite , using ifu observations , and are shown in figure [ bouche ] .",
    "these data correspond to @xmath272 systems with which our model predictions are consistent .",
    "additional measurements have recently been reported by @xcite for lower redshift ( @xmath273 ) systems and our model predicts comparable mean and scatter around the mean ( compare the scatter in the simulated systems to the measurements in figure [ bouche ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that while the @xcite study is biased to galaxies with brighter emission lines , the reported sfr should still be treated as a lower limit on accounts of fiber losses .",
    "just how representative the @xcite measurements are of the true sfr in absorber hosts is yet to be determined .",
    "very high star formation rates around two sight lines with ultra - strong systems at @xmath274 with @xmath275  were reported by @xcite , consistent with our model predictions .",
    "we note , however , that in these cases an interacting galaxy pair is observed and it is not clear which galaxy hosts the absorber and whether a particular galaxy - absorber association is at all meaningful in these cases .",
    "@xcite placed upper limits on the star formation rate in @xmath276 dla systems of @xmath277 . as discussed in  5.3 ,",
    "a large fraction of the dla population may be associated with strong  systems .",
    "given the results of @xcite that show a rather uniform column density distribution for systems of different @xmath7 ( for @xmath278 ) , the objects in the @xcite sample are likely to be associated with the more numerous @xmath279  systems [ for @xmath204  systems the probability for detecting a dla is considerably reduced given the data reported by @xcite ] .",
    "figure [ bouche ] compares the upper limits of the @xcite sample , to which we have assigned a value of @xmath280  ( and note that 68% of selected systems are expected to lie in the range @xmath281  given the shape of the @xmath282 distribution ; see fig .",
    "[ bouche ] ) , to the predictions for the star formation rate at @xmath283 . clearly , model predictions are in qualitative agreement with observations .    @xcite have measured the mean star formation rate for strong absorbers at intermediate ( @xmath284 ) and high ( @xmath285 ) redshifts ( shown in fig .",
    "[ bouche ] ) .",
    "in particular , all systems with @xmath278 were considered in their study .",
    "as before , we assign a @xmath280  value and note that 68% of those systems are expected to lie in the interval @xmath281 .",
    "our mean @xmath95 and @xmath286 models seem to over predict the data by almost an order of magnitude while the median values are within a factor @xmath219 of the measurements .",
    "a similar discrepancy was noted by @xcite when comparing their estimates for the sfr to those deduced by @xcite and @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite , fiber losses could be important , especially in cases where the host extends , or is located beyond , 8kpc from a quasar sightline .",
    "in fact , our model predicts that much of the absorption originates from scales as large as the size of the  disk , and hence beyond the central 8kpc of @xmath287 galaxies .",
    "therefore , the reported values should be considered as lower limits on the mean star - formation rates associated with strong systems .",
    "lastly , we note a potential bias in probing highly star - forming systems using absorption line systems : the kennicutt - schmidt law predicts that , on average , disks with higher star formation rates would be more optically thick , having higher metallicities and , potentially , higher extinctions through their disks .",
    "it is therefore likely that the high sfr end of the distribution of absorbing galaxies will not be recorded in surveys where the background quasars are drawn from magnitude - limited samples .",
    "our model gives specific predictions concerning the relation between @xmath7 and the impact parameter , @xmath77 , from the center of the host galaxy ( but not from satellite galaxies that may cluster around the true host ) . in comparing our model predictions to the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite data set , we assume that these studies identify true absorber - host associations . the steidel et al .",

    "this procedure is then repeated for all absorber - galaxy pairs in the steidel et al .",
    "sample for @xmath290kpc .",
    "in contrast to that , models a and c are characterized by constant wind velocity across galaxy disks . as brighter galaxies have larger disks and more intense sfr , these models predict , on average , an increase in the mean @xmath7 with increasing impact parameter . ] .",
    "the statistical predictions for @xmath291 are compared to the observations in figure [ chuck ] in which a typical realization of the monte carlo simulation is shown .",
    "clearly , the agreement is satisfactory in terms of the predicted mean and the scatter around the mean .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to emphasize that one should be cautious to not over - interpret the outcome of this comparison . in particular , to properly account for the observations , especially at large impact parameters , one needs to account for the possibility of satellite galaxies contributing to the absorption .",
    "this is currently not included in our model .",
    "while one does not expect the cross - section of satellite galaxies to fully cover the sky at large impact parameters around the host , we note that recent studies show that , in contrast to the classic picture , the covering factor for strong  absorption in galaxy halos is , on average , smaller than unity on @xmath292kpc scales @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite reported a covering factor of order 50% for strong systems . if due to @xmath293 hosts",
    "then this value is qualitatively consistent with the expectations from randomly inclined thin disks .",
    "a more comprehensive census of absorbers and satellite galaxies on large scales around hosts is needed to further test and constrain the model .",
    "in  2 we qualitatively showed that strong intervening systems obey a version of the kennicutt - schmidt law for star formation .",
    "in particular , by combining observed relations between absorbers and star forming galaxies , the power - law dependence of the star formation rate on the ( absorbing )  column density was deduced .",
    "in addition , the correct normalization of the kennicutt - schmidt law was obtained when using an order of magnitude estimate for the size of the  disk of absorbers hosts . however , having now obtained a more quantitative connection between absorbers and galaxies , the proper disk size , as a function of @xmath7 , may be used to arrive at a consistent kennicutt - schmidt relation for absorbers within the framework of the model .",
    "more specifically , we need to evaluate the expression @xmath294}{\\pi r_{\\rm eff}\\ { l[w_0({\\left < n_{\\rm h } \\right > ) ] \\}^2 } } . \\label{ss}\\ ] ] aside from @xmath295 , all other relations are given by our model .",
    "in particular , @xmath296 and @xmath175 are drawn from the distributions shown in figure [ dist ] whereas @xmath297 comes from the fit to the @xmath298 distribution , as performed in  4 for the different models considered here .",
    "what @xmath295 relation should we take ?",
    "the kennicutt - schmidt law , @xmath299 , connects the star - formation rate per unit surface in the disk to the _ arithmetic _ mean of the _ total _ hydrogen column density over the disk : @xmath300 . for the @xcite samples",
    ", it was found that @xmath301 and we shall therefore assume that the total hydrogen column density , as traced by strong  systems , and as averaged over a finite patch in the disk , satisfies @xmath302 @xcite . note that this does not necessarily imply that @xmath303 molecules should be seen along sight lines to background quasars since galaxy disks are highly structured , the @xmath303 gas has a low covering factor , and sight lines through molecular gas may be obscured by dust extinction @xcite .",
    "observations of galaxy disks show a very broad range of column densities over the disk surface @xcite , and defining the relevant mean , @xmath304 , is important .",
    "as discussed in  5.3 , the  distribution for galaxy disks is consistent with that measured for absorbers by @xcite . in particular , for both distributions , the arithmetic mean is much larger than the geometric mean . for strong intervening  systems @xcite showed that the arithmetic mean is about @xmath305 larger than the geometric mean for @xmath306  systems in the @xcite sample .",
    "interestingly , in that sample , the measured  column density for strong systems never exceeds @xmath307 , even though the geometric mean over all systems in a given @xmath7 bin does increase as , roughly , @xmath308 ( eq .",
    "[ nhi ] ) . at such a column density , the expected reddening for a galactic dust - to - gas ratio is @xmath309mag , and the sdss",
    "is expected to miss most of the systems resulting in an under - estimation of @xmath304 , perhaps explaining the flat @xmath310 dependence @xcite .",
    "if galaxy disks are self - similar , as would be expected for e.g. , a turbulent medium down to the dissipation scale then the median and mean would , in fact , be proportional for all galaxy luminosities .",
    "for these reasons , we shall assume the following expression linking the _ arithmetic _ mean of the _ total _ hydrogen column density and @xmath7 .",
    "this model resulted in a similar kennicutt - schmidt law as the one presented here and will not be further discussed due to its more complicated nature . ] : @xmath311 in doing so we implicitly assume that the @xcite data are of relevance to @xmath95 systems .",
    "this assumption is supported by our findings (  5.3 ) and the findings of @xcite concerning the match between the  cross - section of @xmath95 galaxy disks and that required to account for high-@xmath41 dla systems .",
    "the relevant radius , @xmath312 , to consider in equation [ ss ] is that which roughly corresponds to the size of the optical disk and over which the schmidt - kennicutt law was originally evaluated . in our model : @xmath313kpc , and therefore corresponds , by definition , to the core radius discussed in  4.1 .",
    "we ran monte carlo simulations obtaining , as before , a mock absorber - galaxy catalog listing @xmath314 $ ] for each object , and calculated the mean relation between the two quantities shown in figure [ schmidt ] .    comparing our model predictions for the kennicutt - schmidt law derived for absorbers to the classic kennicutt - schmidt law for galaxies , we find that the slope of the relation matches well the galactic schmidt - kennicutt law .",
    "the obtained normalization has an offset of a factor @xmath315 along the @xmath316-axis or factor @xmath317 along the @xmath318-axis compared to the galactic kennicutt - schmidt law ( see fig .",
    "[ schmidt ] ) .",
    "such a discrepancy could result from several different reasons : it may be due to an under - estimation of the factor between the arithmetic and the geometric means of the  columns in strong systems , perhaps as a result of an extinction bias .",
    "alternatively , the mismatch could be due to our adopted @xmath297 being smaller by a factor @xmath319 than the true radius .",
    "it may also be the result of our usage of high-@xmath41 relations between @xmath7 and @xmath210 to infer on the properties of local star - forming disks [ a recent theoretical study by @xcite suggests that the schmidt - kennicutt law may be different at higher-@xmath41 ] .",
    "nevertheless , given the uncertainties inherent in our analysis and the simplifications used , we find the match between the predicted kennicutt - schmidt law for absorbers and the observed one for galaxies to be very good . furthermore , upon taking , for example , the ratio of the geometric to arithmetic mean to be @xmath321 , we find an excellent match with the schmidt - kennicutt law for galaxies . a qualitatively similar agreement with the galactic schmidt - kennicutt law",
    "is obtained also for models a , b , and c ( fig .",
    "[ schmidt ] ) .    to further check the correspondence between absorber and galaxies , it is of considerable interest to extend the @xmath7 range of the @xcite sample and quantify the kennicutt - schmidt law over a broader range of parameter space .",
    "interestingly , deviations from the classic kennicutt - schmidt law at the low @xmath210 end have recently been reported for galaxy disks , showing a flattening and a subsequent truncation at still lower column densities @xcite .",
    "our model predictions suggest that most strong , @xmath202  systems arise in faint galaxies having relatively low star formation rates .",
    "the nature of absorption systems is that they probe highly localized regions in space , so it is of interest to see whether deviations from a pure powerlaw are consistent between absorption and emission derived schmidt - kennicutt laws .",
    "if such deviations persist as better statistics are obtained then it may be possible to better quantify the correspondence between our view of disks in absorption and in emission .",
    "this will allow to probe faint star - forming disks at high redshifts using absorbers phenomenology in a way which is complementary to that employed by emission studies .",
    "in particular , these approaches suffer from somewhat different systematics and their synergy will hopefully help to better quantify star formation phenomenon and galaxy evolution physics across cosmic time .",
    "thus far we have considered a global version of the kennicutt - schmidt law , as deduced from the phenomenology of  systems .",
    "nevertheless , there may also be a local version of this law @xcite whereby local outflow properties relate to local star formation processes . at present",
    "we do not have observational evidence to support this hypothesis but note that a relation between the column density of  ions and the velocity dispersion of their resonance @xmath322  absorption transition has been recently reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the powerlaw slope of this relation is similar to the @xmath323 relation discussed in this work .",
    "it is possible that this is a different manifestation of the kennicutt - schmidt law , highlighting the preponderance of outflows and feedback effects from local star forming regions in the galaxy .",
    "we find no evidence that galactic outflows , as probed by strong  systems , extend considerably beyond the disk of their hosts ( i.e. , @xmath138 ) .",
    "this is consistent with a scenario in which most outflows that give rise to strong  systems are launched from compact regions in the disk and do not necessarily escape the galaxy and join the igm .",
    "that said , our results do _ not _ preclude the possibility that galactic outflows reach the large scale galactic halo since , on these scales , the outflow opacity drops as the gas expands .",
    "mapping @xmath140  systems around nearby galaxies of known disk inclinations will shed light on the geometry and origin of the gas and help to determine its role in galaxy formation and igm evolution models .",
    "in addition , better estimates for the spatial distribution of @xmath324 will determine just how far above the disk the cool component of galaxy outflows extends . in any case",
    ", the connection established here between disk outflows and strong intervening systems implies , by means of number counts , that the phenomenon of gas acceleration and ejection from compact star - forming regions occurs over a broad range of galaxy luminosities and is not limited to ( bright ) starburst galaxies ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a _ chandra _ imaging survey of edge - on disks by @xcite presented evidence for extended x - ray emission at right angles from disks for objects with significant star formation rates .",
    "these authors found that while a galaxy like the milky way shows extended x - ray emission on a few kpc scales above and below the disk plane , ( two ) fainter galaxies in their sample , with a lower star formation rate , showed no evidence for such emission .",
    "this led @xcite to conclude that extended emission due to large - scale hot gas bubbles expanding from the disk only occurs when @xmath325 .",
    "nevertheless , to explain the shape of the @xmath326 distribution for @xmath202 , our model requires that outflows occur in disks with a star formation rate as low as @xmath327 .",
    "specifically , in our model , galaxies with @xmath325 can account for the @xcite data for @xmath328 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the smooth shape of the @xmath326 distribution ( with no apparent break at @xmath329 ) is due to a fortuitous combination of strong- and weak - system populations .",
    "alternatively , the absence of hot gas around galaxies with low sfrs could indicate that there is little physical connection between the cold gas that is traced by  systems seen to be outflowing from the disk , and the extended x - ray emitting gas extending high above the disk in some galaxies .",
    "if true , then this may indicate that cold gaseous outflows , manifested as strong  systems , are relatively compact , although covering most of the disk surface , and little can be inferred from their observable properties on the ultimate fate of galactic winds .",
    "it may also mean that while cool outflows are ubiquitous in star - forming systems , only in some objects are conditions favorable for launching large - scale x - ray emitting winds @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of galactic winds or fountains may be gained by investigating the statistical properties of high - ionization line absorbers @xcite , and through the modeling of energy and momentum driven outflows @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile comparing the outflow velocity of cool  outflows to the circular velocity , @xmath330 , of galaxies which serves as a measure of the escape velocity , @xmath331 .",
    "@xcite have quantified the dependence of the circular velocity , @xmath330 , of galaxies on their luminosity and find that @xmath332 , which is similar to the scaling of the wind velocity with the sfr . noting that @xmath22 galaxies at @xmath43 produce stars at a rate of @xmath333 , and using equation [ vw ] we find @xmath334 which implies that for our model a , @xmath335 while for our model b , @xmath336 within @xmath150 ( see  5.4 ) .",
    "we emphasize that these values for @xmath337 values are maximal in the sense that most galaxies will exhibit slower  outflows according to the distribution defined in  3 .",
    "therefore , if model a is relevant then  outflows probably do not escape galaxies and likely form galactic fountains instead .",
    "model b is our more favored model since it accounts for the observed kinematics of galactic outflows (  5.4 ) , explains the dependence of @xmath7 on the impact parameter from the galaxy center , @xmath77 , and is theoretically more plausible (  4.1 ) . in this case , judging from the outflow velocity distribution of figure [ ps ] , we estimate that about 40% of all galaxies or , alternatively , all galaxies for 40% of the time , will eject outflows that could escape their potential wells ( note that these estimates are sensitive to uncertain inclination corrections which we ignore in the present study )",
    ".    we can estimate the mass loss rate that may be associated with such outflows assuming they are able to escape the galaxy .",
    "specifically , the ratio of the mass loss rate to the sfr for a galaxy of luminosity @xmath34 may be written as @xmath338 where we have taken a simplified disk geometry of radius @xmath339 and assumed a constant velocity outflow being launched perpendicular to it . as the outflow velocity declines with @xmath340 , resulting in a wind velocity smaller than the escape velocity , we neglect the contribution to the mass loss rate from radii larger than @xmath150 . in estimating the mass loss rate , we have taken @xmath341 to be the relevant pressure scale height of the disk @xcite , and a typical hydrogen column for the outflowing material of @xmath142 , as appropriate for @xmath342  systems @xcite and assuming hydrogen is mostly in .",
    "we also take a typical ( one - sided ) outflow speed of @xmath343 ( corresponding to a @xmath344  system ) , with @xmath345 being the proton mass .",
    "we expect equation [ mdot ] to have only a very weak dependence on galaxy luminosity since @xmath346const . ,",
    "which is consistent with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "assuming a 40% duty - cycle for such outflows ( see above ) and relevant @xmath133 then galaxies expel gas from their centers at a rate comparable to the rate at which gas is turned into stars .",
    "interestingly , the typical density of the outflowing cool material used here is @xmath347 , somewhat lower than the density of the cool ism phase in the central regions of our galaxy but in good agreement with expectations on larger , @xmath348kpc , scales ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see her fig .",
    "2 ) . clearly our estimates are very qualitative as the particular geometry and structure of the outflowing material is not known [ c.f .",
    "@xcite who interpret similar  outflows in post - starburst galaxies as extending out to 100kpc from galaxy centers in the form of thin shells ] .",
    "in addition , we do not know what fraction of the gas column density is bound to the disk and what remainder constitutes the outflow , which could lead to our above expression over - estimating the mass outflow rate by a factor of a few ( assuming solar metaliclity ) for a given pressure scale height of the disk .",
    "however , despite our qualitative estimates and using the phenomenology of strong intervening absorption systems , we arrive at a mass loss rate that is of order the star formation rate from galaxies , as has been suggested by other works based on very different sets of arguments @xcite .",
    "we have argued that quasar sight lines that show strong absorption systems ( with @xmath117 ) in their spectra , largely probe intervening star forming disks .",
    "while a considerable fraction of the ( ) column density associated with those systems is likely to originate in the gravitationally bound star forming disk itself , the rest equivalent width of the lines , @xmath7 , is largely set by the outflow kinematics .",
    "a version of the kennicutt - schmidt law is obtained when combining the statistical properties of strong intervening systems with those of outflowing material from star forming galaxies . in this case",
    ", the observed cosmic density of intervening systems , @xmath8 , naturally follows from the luminosity function of galaxies and allows us to establish a statistical relation between absorbers and their host galaxies .",
    "conversely , knowledge of the @xmath8 distribution and the star - formation rate in galaxies may be used to shed light on the properties of galactic outflows with preliminary results pointing to an agreement between model predictions and kinematic data for  outflows .",
    "the model presented herein gives detailed and testable predictions for the association between galaxies and absorbers .",
    "for example , based on a fit to the number density distribution of strong intervening systems , the model suggests that galaxies brighter than @xmath161 can give rise to strong intervening systems , which is in broad agreement with the observations .",
    "in addition we find that galaxies over a wide range of luminosities can give rise to absorbers of a given @xmath7 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath342  systems can originate from faint @xmath349 as well as bright @xmath177 galaxies , which may help explain the lack of clear correlations between galaxy and absorber properties in samples with small numbers of quasar - galaxy pairs .",
    "detailed predictions for the statistical relations between the @xmath7 of absorbers , and the star formation rate and luminosity of their hosts ( and vice - versa ) are provided and can be compared to observations .",
    "the model highlights a potential difficulty in the proper identification of the true host galaxies of absorbers due to their faintness and the presence of galaxy - galaxy clustering .",
    "this highlights the importance of uv observations of nearby intervening systems to properly study the absorber - galaxy connection and demonstrates the advantage in probing such the environments at high redshifts using grbs .",
    "further tests of our model are becoming possible with the recent installation of cos on board hst .",
    "in particular , it may be possible to obtain more reliable estimates for the local cosmic density of absorbers , @xmath107 , which is crucial for appropriately calibrating the model and extrapolating its predictions to higher redshifts . better identification of the true hosts of absorption systems and their associated star formation rate , particularly for the faintest galaxy hosts ,",
    "will enable us to compare model predictions to observations .",
    "mapping the outskirts of galaxy disks and looking for the signatures of galactic outflows may lead to a better understanding of galactic outflows with direct implications for intervening systems phenomenology .",
    "the simple correspondence advocated here between absorbers and star forming disks accounts for several additional properties of strong intervening systems .",
    "specifically , by using the luminosity - metallicity relation for galaxies and the deduced absorber - disk relation , we can account for the metallicity of absorbers extrapolated to @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , considering the evolution in the luminosity function of galaxies with redshift , the evolution in the number density of absorbers per unit redshift , @xmath253 is matched .",
    "interestingly , in its simplest version , the model suggests that many of the statistical properties of star - forming galaxies ( such as the specific star formation rate , the dependence of galaxy disk radius on luminosity , and the outflow velocity dependence on the sfr ) have not evolved , considerably , since @xmath350 . as",
    "model predictions are rather sensitive to the scaling laws for galaxies , measurement of absorber density at higher redshifts may prove to be an important probe of galactic physics .",
    "in addition , we find that model predictions concerning the star formation rate in absorbers hosts are consistent with current observations , yet uncertain systematic effects preclude a more comprehensive comparison at this stage .",
    "in addition , we find that the number density of ly@xmath66 absorbers with @xmath351 is broadly consistent with the results of 21 cm emission studies of local galaxies . nevertheless , the abundance of absorbers with  columns in excess of @xmath352 seems to be exceed that which is inferred locally . at present",
    "we do not know whether this relates to evolution effects or to the very different beam sizes used by each approach .",
    "attributing absorbers to gravitationally bound galaxy disks and their related outflows , avoids many of the theoretical complications associated with models that attempt to identify such systems with diffuse halo gas .",
    "for example , problems related to the formation of gas around galaxies that is cool , yet has a high velocity dispersion , are avoided . the need to advect metal - rich gas from the centers of galaxies to large scales without considerable mixing and disruption due to various dynamical instabilities is also alleviated , and the relevant physics to consider is just that of the ism .",
    "cloud stability issues become irrelevant since the gas is , at least initially , gravitationally bound and a mass reservoir exists to replenish any evaporating fraction of it .",
    "our findings point to a different physical state ( and possibly also an origin ) for weak  systems whose properties are not accounted for by the model .",
    "our results imply that strong intervening systems can be used to study the properties of star - forming galaxies at high redshift where direct imaging , especially of faint objects , is challenging .",
    "in particular , our model implies that the evolution in the density of absorbers across cosmic time closely traces the global star formation rate density .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to determine the star formation history of our universe using absorption line phenomenology .",
    "this nicely complements emission studies that are prone to different systematic effects .",
    "a further advantage is that absorption systems may be detected to very high redshifts provided enough bright background sources , such as quasars and grbs may be found .",
    "in addition , metal absorption systems may be used to probe the outer parts of galactic disks , estimate their metallicity in an independent way , and assist in quantifying the metallicity gradient in disks .",
    "this has profound implications for galaxy formation and evolution , igm enrichment history , and feedback processes across cosmic time .",
