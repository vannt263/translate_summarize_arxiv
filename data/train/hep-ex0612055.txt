    "following the discovery @xcite in 1987 by the european muon collaboration that the first moment @xmath4 of spin - dependent structure function @xmath1 of the proton is much smaller than expected from the ellis ",
    "jaffe sum rule , the spin structure of the nucleon became a focus in theoretical and experimental research .",
    "by now it is experimentally well established that indeed the matrix element @xmath5 of the flavour - singlet axial - vector current is small and only in the order of 0.20.3 .",
    "if the quark spins were responsible for the nucleon spin a value around 0.6 is expected . in the @xmath6 renormalisation scheme the sum of the quark spins @xmath7 is given by @xmath5 , while in the so - called adler  bardeen and jet schemes @xmath5 receives an additional contribution from the gluon polarisation @xmath8 of @xmath9 .",
    "this led to the conjecture that a large positive @xmath10 could explain the smallness of @xmath5 and at the same time reestablish the expected contribution of 0.6 from the quark spins to the nucleon spin .",
    "however , in order to respect the spin sum rule @xmath11 a large gluon polarisation requires partial cancellation by orbital angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "the key to solving the nucleon spin puzzle is thus a measurement of gluon polarisation .",
    "now , two decades after the original discovery , we hold in hands first data suggesting that the large @xmath10 scenario is not realised in nature .",
    "the @xmath13 evolution of structure functions is governed by the dglap equations .",
    "thus the polarised gluon distribution function @xmath14 can in principle be obtained from a qcd fit to the world data on the spin - dependent structure function @xmath15 . in the unpolarised case , hera and",
    "fixed - target data combined offer a huge range in @xmath16 and @xmath13 . due to the lack of a polarised _ ep _",
    "collider the situation is completely different in the polarised case . here",
    "the qcd fits rely largely on the rather small difference in @xmath13 between the slac / hermes data on one side and the smc / compass data on the other side , spanning c.m .",
    "energies from 8  gev to 20  gev .",
    "the status of qcd fits was discussed in detail this symposium @xcite . in the small @xmath16 region the new deuteron @xmath1 data from compass @xcite are about six times more precise than the smc data .",
    "compass performed next - to - leading order ( nlo ) fits to the @xmath1 world data including the new deuteron data .",
    "two about equally good solutions for @xmath14 were found , one with a positive and one with a negative first moment @xmath10 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : g1d ] and [ fig : aac_cmp_dg ] ) .",
    "the absolute value is in the order of @xmath17 for @xmath18 and the uncertainty from the fit is in the order of 0.1 .",
    "contributions to the error arising from uncertainties in the factorisation and renormalisation scales as well as the influence of the particular parametrisation chosen for the distribution functions , were not considered .",

    ", they included the @xmath3 helicity asymmetries @xcite from the phenix 2005 run ( see below ) in the fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aac_cmp_dg ] ) . a very significant reduction of the uncertainty of @xmath10 from 1.08 to 0.32 was observed , at least for the @xmath22 solution .",
    "however , the sign ambiguity remains .",
    "the contribution to @xmath10 from the region @xmath23 is @xmath24 for both solutions .",
    "the negative first moment for the @xmath25 solution stems entirely from the @xmath26 region .",
    "in contrast to the compass fit , the aac fit yields a gluon distribution with a node around @xmath27 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the two groups apply different error estimations and thus the error bands shown have different meanings .",
    "while the compass error band corresponds to the change of @xmath28 by unity , the aac bands corresponds to a change of @xmath28 by 12.65 for their eleven free parameters , what corresponds to 63% probabilty to find all parameters simultaneously within one standard deviation rather than an individual parameter .",

    "the dependence of the asymmetry @xmath49 on @xmath0 contains a quadratic term which makes it at present impossible to determine the sign of @xmath0 from rhic data .",

    "new data from compass and rhic will further clarify the composition of the nucleon spin .",
    "the restoration of a 60% contribution of the quark spins via the axial anomaly is basically ruled out .",
    "the new challenge is to precisely determine the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by gluon spins rather than distinguishing between the various scenarios of the ` spin puzzle ' .",
    "this must include a precise pinning down of the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "for this purpose a global analysis of all relevant data is indispensable .",
    "a particular effort needs to be made to include the lepton data in a consistent way in the nlo analyses .",
