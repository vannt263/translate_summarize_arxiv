    "the sensitivity of the detector is obtained by using the rn daughters decay for alpha particles in the energy range of 5.3 - 7.7 mev .",
    "the low energy calibration of the detector from 100 ev up to several tenths of kev is achieved by using x - rays and a uv lamp @xcite .",
    "the detector has been successfully used as a neutron detector based on the @xmath6 reaction . at the present work",
    "the spherical proportional counter has been optimized for operation in pure nitrogen ( @xmath0 ) , which presents an interesting neutron converter , permitting neutron spectroscopy up to 20 mev .",
    "the thermal and fast neutrons are detected via the @xmath2 reaction and the fast neutrons with energy greater than 1.7 mev via the@xmath3 reaction .",
    "the low background of the detector and the possibility to separate the @xmath7 ray pulses from the proton and alpha particle pulses ( through pulse shape analysis ) increase the sensitivity for the neutron detection .",
    "the detector can successfully measure very low thermal neutron fluxes , giving the possibility for neutron energy spectrum up to several mev at ground and underground level @xcite .",
    "the detector consists of a large spherical copper vessel , 1.3 m in diameter and 6 mm thick .",
    "the spherical vessel is well pumped ( up to @xmath8 ) and then filled with a gas mixture at a pressure from several hundreds of mbar up to 5 bar .",
    "an outgassing in the order of @xmath9 is necessary for the amplification stability , because the presence of the @xmath10 in the drift volume induces electron attachment . a small stainless ball , usually of 14 mm in diameter ,",
    "is fixed in the center of the spherical vessel by a stainless steel rod , acts as an electrode with positive high voltage and as a proportional amplification counter . in order to fulfill the requirements for operation with pure @xmath11",
    "the 14 mm ball has been replaced by a smaller 8 mm and 3 mm ball .",
    "in addition , to reduce negative effects of occasional sparks the metallic ball has been successfully replaced by a silicon ball .",

    "a @xmath4 neutron source on the top of the sphere has been used for thermal and fast neutron detection .",
    "fast neutrons can be well detected also via the    @xmath20    reaction up to @xmath21 = 20 mev .",
    "this endothermic reaction plays a dominant role in the fast neutron detection for an incident neutron energy greater than 1.7 mev , since the cross section of the @xmath3 reaction is higher than that of the @xmath2 reaction .     and",

    "if the reaction takes place close to the vessel wall , it is possible for one of the charged particles or both of them to hit the wall and to lose a part of their energy .",
    "this is known as the wall effect and leads to wrong estimation of the neutron energy . in the case of the detector",
    "being used as a neutron spectrometer and not as a simple neutron counter , the wall effect plays an important role .",
    "the wall effect depends on the ranges of the produced particles in the drift volume and on the size of the detector . in figure [ wall ]",
    "we present the wall effect of the sphere as a function of the sum of the ranges of the produced charged particles .",
    "the range of @xmath27 and the range of protons in the case of the @xmath23 reactions , the range of @xmath28 and the range of alphas for the @xmath24 reactions .",

    "the proton range for thermal neutrons is 2.2 cm and the wall effect 2% .",
    "the @xmath27 range is very low compared with that of the protons ( 250 @xmath29 for the thermal neutrons ) .",
    "the wall effect is more important for the fast neutrons since the range of 1.5 mev protons is 8.7 cm in the same gas mixture at 500 mbar and the wall effect 10% . for neutron energies higher than 2 mev",
    "the @xmath30 reaction is the dominant one for the fast neutron detection .",
    "as an example , the ranges of the @xmath31 and the @xmath32 particles in 500 mbar @xmath11 for 4 mev neutrons are approximately 0.7 cm and 3 cm respectively and the wall effect is 4% .     and the p.,width=264 ]",
    "there are many commercially available neutron counters mainly in cylindrical shape , with different diameters and lengths .",
    "the tubes are filled with @xmath33 gas or @xmath34 gas and the neutrons are detected via the @xmath6 and @xmath35 reactions .",

    "additionally the cost of the @xmath33 gas is very high and the @xmath34 is very toxic gas . for the fast neutrons up to 20",
    "mev the three isotopes , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath15 , have comparable cross sections ( figure [ cs2 ] ) , but the large volume of the spherical detector ( @xmath43 ) with the large amount of @xmath11 gas ( up to 500 mbar ) inside , gives the possibility for direct fast neutron spectroscopy .",
    "the use of @xmath33 instead of @xmath11 in the spherical proportional counter is also suitable for fast neutron spectroscopy , but the high cost of the @xmath33 gas is a big disadvantage . in a polyenergetic neutron field (",
    "thermal and fast neutrons ) the @xmath33 fast neutron recoils give similar signals with those of the 0.76 mev thermal neutron peak , increasing the background .",
    "both the @xmath33 and the@xmath34 counters can be used for fast neutron detection but with the help of moderators .",
    "the first test measurements have shown the capabilities of the spherical detector as a neutron counter based on @xmath11 and have revealed its potential as a simple neutron spectrometer .",
    "the performance of the detector is expected to improve in the coming tests by applying the following changes :    * operation in higher gas pressure , thus increasing the detection efficiency and minimizing at the same time the wall effect * reduce the diameter of the electrode ball * use mixtures of @xmath11 with heavy gasses like ar and xe .",
    "the addition of those gasses will reduce the range of the reaction products , limiting the wall effect    , @xmath35 , @xmath2 and @xmath30 for fast neutrons of energy up to 20 mev.,width=264 ]    on going simulations show that particle discrimination through pulse shape analysis technique is possible .",
    "the separation is based on the fact that the proton range in the gas is longer than the one of alpha particles of the same energy , which reflects to larger risetimes as it can be seen in figure [ range ] .",
    "identifying @xmath23 from @xmath24 reactions will simplify the neutron spectrum reconstruction .",
    "furthermore , the wall effect is much less important for the @xmath24 reactions , so it is expected to extend the range of the spectroscopy to higher neutron energies .    in order to exploit the spectroscopy capabilities of the spherical detector we are planning a series of measurements with monoenergetic neutron beams in facilities like cea cadarache or n.c.s.r .",
