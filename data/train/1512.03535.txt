    "the fomalhaut debris disk has become the prototype for understanding the complexity of disk structures and their relationship to planetary systems . due to its proximity ( 7.7 pc ) and luminosity ( 17.4 l@xmath7 ) , many key features of its debris are easily accessible through optical , infrared and millimeter ground- and space - based facilities . the prominent planetesimal ring located at @xmath2140 au , analogous to the kuiper belt in our solar system ,",
    "is particularly well - studied @xcite .",
    "the sharp boundaries of this cold ( @xmath250 k ) ring suggest gravitational shaping by unseen planets @xcite .",
    "intense collisions among the planetesimals in this ring grind large ( parent ) bodies into fine dust , forming a disk halo composed of @xmath2@xmath3 m size grains outside the cold ring @xcite .",
    "the fomalhaut disk has a warm ( @xmath2150 k ) , unresolved component near the star , first indicated by _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath3 m imaging @xcite and later confirmed by _",
    "_ imaging @xcite .",
    "this warm excess has been suggested as an ice - line planetesimal belt , analogous to the asteroid belt in our solar system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fomalhaut system is thought to have a very hot ( @xmath21500 k ) exozodiacal dust population at @xmath20.1 au , revealed by ground - based interferometry at 2 @xmath3 m ( @xmath8-band ) @xcite .",
    "interferometric data at @xmath210 @xmath0  detect a hot component near @xmath212 au @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fomalhaut system is the only system known to possess all five debris zones ( very hot , hot , warm , cold , and halo dust ) defined by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the debris system around fomalhaut , a combination of imaging where the warm component can be spatially separated from the cold component and mid - infrared spectroscopy has revealed similar inner warm components in other nearby systems , for example , @xmath9 eri : @xcite , hr 8799 : @xcite , vega : @xcite .",
    "@xmath220% of unresolved debris disks show such warm components in their disk spectral energy distributions ( seds ) @xcite .",
    "leftover parent bodies near the star generally have higher collisional velocities , i.e. , shorter dynamical time scales , compared to those of more distant ones , as suggested in the fading of the warm components after a few hundred myr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these components may be analogous to our asteroid belt but with far greater mass ; however , compared to the cold kuiper - belt analogs they are much harder to characterize in exoplanetary systems .",
    "identification and characterization of such warm components require very accurate extrapolation of the stellar spectrum and precise subtraction .",
    "not surprisingly , although it can be considered the prototype , the nature of the fomalhaut warm component is controversial .",
    "@xcite propose that it originates from free - free emission of a postulated stellar wind that also creates the hot excess revealed in near - infrared interferometry .",
    "however , @xcite draw from all the resolved images and the spectroscopy to argue that it is a planetesimal ring placed near the ice line and presumably created by processes occurring in other debris systems as well . in that case",
    "the fomalhaut debris disk resembles the debris structures in our solar system  a dense kuiper belt whose inner edge is maintained by massive planets @xcite and a more tenuous asteroid belt containing dust structure ( zodiacal cloud ) determined by both the giant and terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "there is a tentative detection of an excess in the alma cycle 0 image of fomalhaut @xcite , but less than the prediction by the free - free model , and the star was at the edge of the primary beam so the excess flux is subject to the large uncertainty of the primary beam correction . here",
    "we present a high angular resolution and sensitivity alma cycle 1 image centered at the star position , and provide a strong constraint on the amount of excess emission in the inner part of the fomalhaut system .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes the details of the alma observation and data reduction . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss the 870 @xmath0  measurement near the star , evaluate the expected photospheric value of fomalhaut at this wavelength , and rule out any compact free - free emission originated from the star as the possible source of excess emission detected by _",
    "spitzer _ and _ herschel_. in section 4.1 we review the properties of the inner 20 au region in fomalhaut by assessing all available excess measurements and discussing their uncertainties . we conclude that a warm excess at the ice sublimation temperature ( @xmath2150 k , i.e. , an asteroid - belt analog ) is robustly detected , independent of the uncertainty of photospheric subtraction and the presence of a tentative , hot ( @xmath2500 k ) excess . in section 4.2 ,",
    "we present sed models for the ice - line asteroid belt around fomalhaut and set constraints on its total flux at 870 @xmath3 m , and we also show that a 13-au narrow belt might be detected at @xmath102@xmath5 levels in the cycle 1 alma data . in section 4.3 , we propose a new interpretation for the hot excess detected by the keck interferometric nuller ( kin ) via linking the proposed asteroid belt to the dust structure in the inner 10 au region",

    "we did this in two parts .",
    "first , we verified @xmath15 cen a is a solar analog by comparing its colors with those of the sun .",
    "then , we computed the submillimeter flux of @xmath15 cen a using the solar relation between measured 24 @xmath0  and submillimeter .",
    "we derived colors of @xmath16=1.531@xmath140.023 , @xmath17$]=1.584@xmath140.027 , and @xmath18$]=0.053@xmath140.032 using the available @xmath8-band measurement from @xcite , @xmath19-band from @xcite , @xcite and _ hipparcos _ , and 24 @xmath0  measurement of 30.84 jy from @xcite after proper photometric system transformation and calibration to the zero points defined by @xcite .",
    "these colors are virtually identical to those of the sun and establish @xmath15 cen a as a valid solar analog star for the purpose of calibration .",
    "we then used measurements of the solar brightness temperature to connect the mid - infrared measurements to the alma calibration at 870 @xmath3 m .",
    "we adopt the brightness temperature at 24 @xmath3 m to be 4625 k ( model m in @xcite ) , and the brightness temperature at 870 @xmath0  to be 5470 k @xcite . taking 30.84@xmath140.76 jy as the 24 @xmath0  flux of @xmath15 cen a @xcite , the scaling from the solar brightness temperatures suggests @xmath15 cen a has a flux density of 28.9 mjy at 872 @xmath3 m . the error associated with this number",

    "the measurement of 26.1@xmath140.2 mjy for @xmath15 cen a from @xcite then suggests that the solar analog calibration is brighter than the alma measurement by 10.7@xmath147% , which confirms the 10% alma calibration uncertainty estimate is plausible .",
    "if we adjust the measurement of fomalhaut to this alternative calibration , we find a flux density of 1.98 mjy ( instead of 1.789 mjy ) , still somewhat fainter ( by @xmath211% ) than the rayleigh - jeans extrapolation from 24 @xmath3 m . we conclude that radiative transfer effects may cause a drop in the brightness temperature of the star , similar to the behavior of the sun , which has a brightness temperature @xmath205800 k across the visible @xcite but of only 5470 k at 870 @xmath3 m .",
    "the result that fomalhaut is slightly fainter than the rayleigh - jeans extrapolation value is robust , and this independent calibration of our measurement also rules out any compact free - free emission originating from the star as the possible source of excess emission detected by _ spitzer _ and _",
    "in this subsection , we review all the available measurements that can be used to constrain the excess properties of the inner 20 au region in fomalhaut .",
    "these measurements can be categorized in two classes : ( i ) resolved measurements where emission from the cold belt is mostly excluded , and ( ii ) unresolved measurements at the wavelengths where the cold belt contributes much less emission . in category ( i ) , the ground - based interferometric measurements suggest a @xmath8-band excess of 0.88%@xmath140.12% ( @xcite , hereafter the vlti measurement ) and 813 @xmath0  excess of 0.35%@xmath140.10% ( @xcite , hereafter the kin measurements ) relative to the stellar photosphere .",
    "these interferometric observations can very effectively isolate the region that is very close to the star ( @xmath102 au in k - band and @xmath106 au at 813 @xmath0 ) from the contribution of the stellar photosphere .",
    "in addition , the excess emission at 24 and 70 @xmath0  inferred from the resolved images of fomalhaut by _",
    "spitzer _ and _ herschel _ also belongs to the first category .",
    "since the star and any unresolved excess are both contained within the instrument s point spread function ( psf ) , the excess estimate does depend on the expected photospheric values .    in determining the unresolved excess ,",
    "an accurate value for the photospheric flux is essential ; it can be determined at @xmath22% levels by fitting the stellar atmospheric models to the optical to near infrared photometry @xcite . at 24 @xmath3 m",
    ", an additional unresolved source of 0.6@xmath140.2 jy was found in the early reduction of the mips data @xcite .",
    "we reduced the original data with the final in - house reduction pipeline and calibration , and employed the psf subtraction method .",
    "we find the unresolved excess at 24 @xmath0  is 0.64@xmath140.13 jy , consistent with the old value ( but with a smaller uncertainty ) .",
    "@xcite constrained the amount of the unresolved excess by fitting the resolved images with a sed model using complex dust grains ( a mixture of compositions proposed by @xcite ) , and derived a total of 0.17@xmath140.02 jy for the unresolved excess at 70 @xmath3 m .",
    "@xcite employed the psf subtraction method , and derived a consistent number , 0.17 jy with upper- and lower - bound fluxes of 0.58 jy and 0.136 jy for the unresolved excess .",
    "the resolution at both _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath0  and _ herschel _ 70 @xmath0  is very similar ( @xmath26 ) , which places the excess emission mostly from the region within @xmath220 au in projected stellocentric distance .    in category ( ii ) , the _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectrum of the fomalhaut system presented in @xcite provides good measurements in the 1030 @xmath0  region .",
    "the irs spectrum was extracted and calibrated as a point source ( resolution of @xmath26 ) . with a large slit size of 111 in the irs long - high channel ,",
    "the flux longward of @xmath230 @xmath0  might be contaminated by the cold ring .",
    "furthermore , the irs excess emission is subject to the uncertainty of photospheric subtraction . to account for this",
    ", the uncertainty for the irs excess emission includes 2% of the photospheric emission ( added quadratically ) as shown in figure [ fom_innerexcess ] . to illustrate the effect of photospheric subtraction , we also present excess spectra by artificially scaling our best - determined photospheric model by @xmath142% . the resultant spectra ( shown in figure [ fom_innerexcess ] ) have higher / lower flux in the 1015 @xmath0  region , but both are within the estimated uncertainty ( gray area ) .",
    "we augment the irs excess determination with additional accurate2% level , using a color difference referenced to a clean , no infrared excess star ( like sirius ) can avoid the uncertainty in photospheric subtraction as long as both the star of interest and the reference star ( sirius ) have a similar spectral type and accurate photometry .",

    "broadband photometry .",
    "we adopt the accurate psf fitting photometry ( @xmath141.5% level ) by @xcite for fomalhaut and sirius in the irac bands . the color difference between fomalhaut and sirius",
    "is 2.36 mag at irac 1 , 2 , 3 bands , but 2.33 mag at irac band 4 , suggesting a 3%@xmath141.5% excess at irac 8 @xmath3 m ( a very broad bandwidth of 36% ) .",
    "since the irac measurement was derived by psf fitting , the excess most likely originates from the region within 8 au ( in radius ) ( resolution of @xmath22  at irac 8 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "[ fom_innerexcess ]    one good way to characterize where the bulk of excess emission comes from is to determine the dominant dust temperature in the excess spectrum .",
    "this dominant dust temperature simply means that the majority of the dust grains have a similar dust temperature , which is not subject to a specific grain model even though this temperature is usually derived by the blackbody formula .",
    "fitting the irs excess emission , the inner warm emission is best described by a blackbody emission of @xmath2170 k ( see figure [ fom_innerexcess ] ) ; and the temperature remains the same for the excess spectrum that was over - subtracted by 2% more of the photosphere .",
    "if the photosphere level is lower by 2% compared to the nominal level ( i.e. , under - subtracted ) , the resultant irs excess emission needs at least two temperatures to fit , 167 k and 497 k. due to the uncertainty of the photospheric subtraction , we can not rule out the presence of @xmath2500 k dust in the system , especially , the two - temperature fit is a better fit to the irac 8 @xmath0  point .",
    "an alternative fit in this case is a single blackbody plus a weak ( broad ) silicate emission feature ( see discussion in section 4.3.2 and figure [ complex_model ] for some examples ) .",
    "even with this tentative excess emission either at @xmath2500 k or a broad feature , the 1030 @xmath0  excess can only be fitted with a cooler component at 167 k , suggesting the robustness of the warm excess at the temperature of water ice sublimation ( @xmath2150 k ) , i.e. , an asteroid - belt analog .",
    "we use a simple optically thin sed model to estimate the physical location of the asteroid belt .",
    "our sed model is based on the assumption that the warm ( @xmath2170 k ) excess originates from a planetesimal belt located near the water ice line .",
    "therefore , we only use data longward of @xmath210 @xmath0  to constrain our fits and do not include the possible hot @xmath2500 k component ( see section 4.3 for further discussion ) . in this",
    "scenario , dust debris is generated through collisions of large parent bodies and cascades down to fine grains ( close to the radiation blowout size ) with a typical power - law slope of @xmath113.5@xmath2@xmath113.7 @xcite .",

    "the maximum grain size is set at 1 mm since grains larger than this size contribute negligible emission in the infrared .",
    "we further assume the warm dust belt is confined in a narrow ring ( nr ) with a fixed width of 2 au .",
    "the exact function of the density distribution in the warm belt has little impact in the output sed for such a narrow ring ; therefore , we adopt a gaussian profile for the ring s density distribution .",
    "because we lack good constraints on the rayleigh - jeans side of the excess emission , the sed models are not well constrained even with all the assumptions mentioned before .",
    "a small range of @xmath2815 au with various combinations of minimum grain size and size distribution slope can all provide satisfactory fits to the observed sed .",
    "we illustrate this degeneracy by presenting two narrow - ring models peaked at 9 and 13 au shown in figure [ fom_innerexcess_models ] , where both models have the same grain size distribution ( 5 @xmath0  to 1 mm silicate grains with a size slope of @xmath113.65 ) .",
