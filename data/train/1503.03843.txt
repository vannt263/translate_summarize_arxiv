    "some biological tissues have evolved into folded morphologies to accommodate large surfaces in small volumes ; folding of the mammalian brain is associated with expansion of its outer cerebral cortex , and the folded epithelium in the gut provides large surface area for absorption of nutrients .",
    "pattern formation in morphogenesis is typically attributed to chemical instabilities within turing s reaction - diffusion paradigm @xcite , but increasing experimental evidence shows that these folded morphologies actually emerge from smooth precursors via mechanical instabilities driven by differential growth of layered tissues @xcite .",
    "recent studies have considered mechanical descriptions of brain folding @xcite , epithelial folding in the gut @xcite and carcinomas @xcite , fingerprint formation @xcite , and circumferential buckling in tubular organs and tumors @xcite .",
    "we consider the most elementary model for soft tissue folding : a growing elastic layer with shear modulus @xmath0 and relaxed thickness @xmath1 adhered to an infinite substrate with shear modulus @xmath2 .",
    "the layer s growth induces compression , ultimately causing it to buckle @xcite . if @xmath3 the layer buckles supercritically into smooth wrinkled patterns @xcite with wavelength @xmath4 explicable via small strains and linear stability analysis @xcite .",
    "if @xmath5 , the substrate does not deform , but after sufficient growth the layer s free surface invaginates into cusped furrows called sulci or creases via an exotic supercritical non - linear instability that eludes analytic treatment @xcite .",
    "however , most cases of biological interest involve a growing soft tissue on a comparably soft substrate  a mechanically intriguing regime @xcite that must span a transition from smooth to cusped folding .",
    "previous theoretical studies have focused on two dimensions and have considered post - bifurcation behavior when approaching this transition from the stiff - layer smooth wrinkling side @xcite , and the linear stability of circular layers either side of the transition @xcite .",
    "here we use linear analysis and numerics to explore folding around the transition itself , including beyond threshold behavior in two and three dimensions .",
    "we discover the transition occurs via an unexpected region of subcritical cusped folding and is accompanied by an unusually rich set of three - dimensional pattern morphologies , which we argue underpin the mechanics and diversity of invaginations in developmental biology .",
    "we examine the stability of a layer occupying @xmath6 atop a substrate occupying @xmath7 .",
    "the layer has undergone growth , swelling , or pre - strain such that , without adhesion , it would undergo a relaxing deformation @xmath8 , becoming a flat slab with thickness @xmath9 .",
    "we model both tissues as incompressible neo - hookean elastic solids so that , if this reference state is subject to a displacement @xmath10 and corresponding deformation gradient @xmath11 , the elastic energy per unit volume is @xmath12 in the substrate and @xmath13 in the layer , while incompressibility requires @xmath14 .    .",

    "we first consider uniaxial growth , @xmath19 , and consider the layer s linear stability to infinitesimal isochoric perturbations , @xmath20 .",
    "the full calculation is in appendix [ theoretical_si ] ; here we restrict ourselves to an overview .",
    "the linearized euler - lagrange equations for the solids require @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 in the substrate ) , solved by @xmath23 in the layer and @xmath24 in the substrate . imposing material continuity at the interface and natural boundary conditions at the free surface and interface",
    "we conclude the layer becomes linearly unstable when @xmath15 satisfies @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig : theory]a plots this threshold as a function of wavelength for different modulus ratios .",
    "minimizing this threshold over wavelengths gives the wavelength and threshold of the first unstable mode as a function of @xmath18 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory]b - c .",
    "as expected the instability reproduces the long - wavelength wrinkling limit for @xmath3 and the zero wavelength biot instability @xcite at @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "the transition from finite to zero wavelength instability happens continuously at @xmath29 however , the zero wavelength biot instability is never observed : it is always preceded by a point of nonlinear instability to infinitesimal cusped sulci @xcite . in incompressible neo - hookean materials",
    "this occurs at a uniaxial stretch @xmath30 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath31 .",
    "thus we expect finite wavelength wrinkling as predicted by linear stability for @xmath32 , where the linear threshold intersects @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : theory]c ) , and direct sulcification at @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "we verify these predictions and explore folding beyond threshold with numerical simulations ( appendix [ numerical_si ] ) , starting with uniaxial growth in two dimensions .",
    "when @xmath35 the surface indeed buckles smoothly at the linear instability threshold .",
    "this buckling amplifies surface compression in the valleys , producing the sulcification strain there shortly thereafter .",
    "the valleys then sulcify in a secondary bifurcation which occurs before @xmath33 up to @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ simfig2d]a ) .",
    "cusps form first on the surface and then on the interface between the layer and substrate at high @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ simfig2d]c ) .",
    "however , the interface in real systems may not be strictly sharp , suppressing interfacial cusping .",
    "when @xmath37 sulcification sets in at @xmath33 , before the linear instability .",
    "for @xmath18 near @xmath38 the energy of the system at @xmath39 is minimized by a cusped fold that has a finite amplitude ( see the layer with @xmath40 and @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ simfig2d]c ) , implying that sulcification is a nonlinear subcritical instability when @xmath18 is near @xmath38 .",
    "the instability is known to be supercritical in both the stiff layer wrinkling limit @xmath3 and in the @xmath42 pure sulcifications limit @xcite , so this region of sub - criticality between the two limits is a surprise , stemming from hybridization of the two modes . in fig .",
    "[ unfolding_amplitude ] we show hysteresis loops for the instability at three values of @xmath18 characterizing the three regimes : linear and super - critical for @xmath3 , non - linear and subcritical for @xmath43 and non - linear and supercritical for @xmath44 .",
    "analogous subcritical instabilities were recently identified in two - dimensional elastic systems with jointly compressed layer and substrate @xcite .",
    "these systems differ from ours particularly strongly in the region of subcriticality : indeed at @xmath45 the distinction between layer and substrate vanishes in the jointly compressed system , so the wavelength scales with the total depth of the system , whereas in our system the layer is distinguished by its growth even at @xmath45 and the wavelength is always finite despite the substrate being infinite .",
    "we optimized the wavelengths of the folds for minimum energy ( fig .",
    "[ simfig2d]b ) finding that in the smooth - folding regime , @xmath35 , the wavelength @xmath46 decreases past threshold ( in eulerian coordinates ) , which is similar to folding of stiff layers @xcite . in contrast , when @xmath37 the optimal wavelength increases past threshold .",
    "consequently the optimal wavelength settles to about four times the undeformed layer thickness over a wide range of @xmath18 when @xmath15 becomes large .",
    "this agrees with the folding patterns in the brain and the gut @xcite , and is a hallmark of mechanical compressive folding .",
    "the low @xmath18 folds are notably asymmetric , with a deeply cusped upper surface and a wavy bottom surface , in contrast to nearly top - bottom symmetric folds at @xmath35 that take a sawtooth - like form at high amplitudes ( fig .",
    "[ simfig2d]c ) .",
    "this agrees again with the observations in folded tissues ; the brain has a low modulus ratio between the cortex and sublayers ( @xmath43 @xcite ) leading to thick and deeply cusped asymmetric folds ( fig .",
    "[ simfig2d]d ) @xcite , whereas narrower folds with a sawtooth profile ( fig .",
    "[ simfig2d]e ) are seen during gut development , owing to a relatively stiff epithelium that folds on a softer mesenchyme @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that in a developing chick gut the epithelium and mesenchyme are both confined by outer layers of smooth muscle , which contributes to folding at early stages @xcite .",
    "if @xmath47 is not uniaxial , but we nevertheless consider @xmath48 plane - strain deformations then , as seen in eqn .  [ plane - strain - energy - density ] , the elastic energy depends on two dimensionless parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "our plane - strain calculations thus hold with the identifications @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in particular , for transversely isotropic growth , @xmath53",
    ", the sulcification threshold is at @xmath54 , i.e , @xmath55 , and the linear threshold intersects @xmath33 at @xmath56 .",
    "this plane - strain calculation captures the full linear stability of the system since the fourier modes that would make up a truly three - dimensional pattern can not interact at the level of linear stability .    before examining folded states in three dimensions , we recall previous results in the stiff and soft layer limits : in stiff layers ( @xmath57 ) a hexagonally ordered pattern of dents forms near threshold @xcite ( although analyses based on the plate theory predict a checkerboard pattern in the stiff film limit @xcite ) and a zigzag ( herringbone ) pattern is the preferred far - from - threshold pattern @xcite . in contrast , in clamped soft layers ( @xmath58 ) we previously identified a square pattern of line - like sulci with alternating orientations as the optimal near threshold pattern and a hexagonal array of triple - junction sulci as the optimal far - from - threshold pattern @xcite .",
    "there should thus be transitions between the two sets of patterns as the layer stiffness is reduced from large toward zero .",
    "whereas folding of relatively stiff layers can be studied even at large overstresses using experimental setups based on swelling elastomers @xcite , folding of soft layers is harder to realize in experimental model systems because large swelling ratios are needed to reach far - from - threshold states .",
    "patterns of line - like sulci and triple - junction sulci have been produced experimentally in soft layers adhered to rigid substrates @xcite , but very few experiments have explored three dimensional folding patterns in the regime of modest stiffness ratios @xcite .",
    "we simulate three dimensional folding patterns induced by transversely isotropic growth of the layer on periodic domains that contain one unit cell of the pattern with energetically optimized wavelengths ( appendix a ) .",
    "we use external guiding forces to inititate the patterns that , once formed , are stable in the neighborhood of @xmath18,@xmath15-space where they are the energy minimizing patterns .",
    "optimal near - threshold patterns , including a rectangular array of line - like sulci at @xmath59 and smooth hexagonal dents at @xmath35 , are shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ simfig3d]a .",
    "these patterns minimize the energy only at @xmath60 close to unity , where we define the relative growth strain @xmath61 to conveniently quantify distance from the threshold ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the growth ratio at the threshold ) . as in two dimensions , folding is subcritical when @xmath18 is near @xmath38 , evidenced by a finite amplitude pattern at the threshold @xmath39 when @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ simfig3d]a ) . for far - from - threshold states ( @xmath66 )",
    "we construct zigzag patterns as well as patterns of hexagonal triple - junctions , discovering that these two patterns are almost equally good energy minimizers ( fig .  [ simfig3d]c ) . however , the triple - junctions are slightly better at low @xmath18 and/or high @xmath60 , while zigzags become relatively better toward large @xmath18 , as expected .",
    "[ simfig3d]b shows a phase diagram summarizing these findings .",
    "the optimal wavelengths of the zigzags and triple - junctions are shown in fig .",
    "[ simfig3d]d and [ simfig3d]e , respectively .",
    "as in the uniaxial case , the wavelengths decrease with @xmath15 when @xmath35 , but remain nearly steady when @xmath67 , resulting in an approximate collapse of the wavelengths toward large @xmath15 such that the width of the folds is again roughly four times the undeformed layer thickness .",
    "this means that further expansion of the layer is accomodated by increasing amplitude .",
    "the optimal @xmath68-aspect ratio of zigzags decreases with decreasing @xmath18 such that the zigzags in soft layers are relatively shorter than their stiff - layer counterparts @xcite .",
    "given the nearly equal energies of the zigzag and triple - junction folds , it is not surprising that systems with modest modulus ratios , such as the folded cerebral cortex ( fig .  [ simfig3d]h ) or its gel layer mimics @xcite , show disordered mixtures of zigzags and triple junctions ( in contrast , epithelium of the gut shows ordered zigzags , see fig .",
    "[ simfig3d]f , owing to a higher modulus ratio and anisotropy @xcite ) . by simulating unaided folding of the biaxially growing layer in a large simulation domain",
    "whose width is multiple times the wavelength of the patterns ( appendix a ) , we see comparatively ordered near - threshold patterns similar to those in fig .",
    "[ simfig3d]a , but the far - from - threshold patterns appear as disordered mixtures of zigzag - folds and triple - junctions , reminiscent of the folded cerebral cortex when @xmath43 ( figs .",
    "[ simfig3d]f and [ simfig3d]g ) .",
    "the disordered patterns include some t - shaped triple - junction folds that lack the rotational symmetry of the y - shaped ones .",
    "t - shaped folds do not , however , form a simple periodic pattern and they may thus be considered as variants of the ideal y - shaped folds .",
    "we note that the disordered patterns resulting from unaided folding have slightly higher energies than the corresponding periodic zigzag or triple - junction patterns .",
    "our study demonstrates that complex fold patterns emerge from even the simplest systems incorporating elasticity and differential growth , providing a guide for more specific applications incorporating , for example , curved geometries , anisotropy , prestressed substrates , compressibility and stress relaxation .",
    "we show a transition as a function of modulus ratio from supercritical smooth finite - wavelength buckling followed by sulcification of valleys to direct strongly subcritical sulcification at @xmath69 , depending on growth anistropy .",
    "this is accompanied by a transition from contraction to elongation of past threshold wavelengths , driving a convergence to spacings within three to four layer thicknesses over a range of modulus ratios in both two and three dimensions . in equibiaxial growth",
    "there is also a beyond threshold transition from zigzags to triple - junction folds within the typical range of modulus ratios in soft layered tissues , underpinning the morphogenetic diversity of mechanical folding .",
