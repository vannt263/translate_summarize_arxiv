    "the series - parallel networks are one of the simplest models of real networks .",
    "then even if it is at last one century old ( mac mahon 1892 ) , it still occurs frequently in both theoretical or applied studies .",
    "some questions like the reliability ( feo and johnson 1990 ) , the survival probability after failures , the routing problem and the queuing delay ( tamir 1993 ) , etc .",
    "are now an important branch of probability theory applied to communication , computer or power networks .    as usual in this kind of model , the elementary components ( resistances or switches )",
    "are chosen all identical .",
    "then the interest is in the behavior of the structure made of series or parallel connections .",
    "some authors ( riordan 1958 , lomnicki 1972 ) investigated this problem with a combinatorial point of view , and , in particular , give recurrences to compute the number of different structures built with @xmath0 elements .",
    "then , they consider the problem as formally `` solved '' .    in this article , we study this model by using analogies with statistical physics models like self - avoiding walks ( des cloizeaux and jannink 1987 ) , lattice animals and percolation ( derrida and de seze 1982 ) , folding and meanders model ( di francesco et al .",
    "1996 ) , etc .",
    "in all these models , the number of configurations for @xmath0 elements ( steps , links , folds ) grows asymptotically like @xmath4 where @xmath5 depends on the details of the model and @xmath3 is an `` universal '' exponent , common to a broad set of models ( `` universality '' class ) .    in section 2",
    ", we define the problem . in section 3 , we explain how to enumerate the series - parallel networks . finally ,",
    "in section 4 , we give by numerical extrapolation a value for @xmath5 and we show that @xmath6 .",
    "the two - terminal series - parallel networks are electric network considered geometrically .",
    "they are built with _ elements _",
    "@xmath7 which are conductor ( @xmath8 ) or insulator ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "when two structures ( with conductivities @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are in parallel , their ( global ) conductivity is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the boolean operator _",
    "or_. when they are in series , it is @xmath14 where the product is the boolean operator _",
    "a network with @xmath0 elements , which connects two - terminal nodes , has a boolean representation @xmath15 .",
    "we consider that two networks are _ equivalent _ if their boolean representations differ only by a permutation of variables @xmath16 .",
    "for example , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are equivalent .",
    "we note that this definition is less restrictive than topological definition . in other words , equivalence consists of interchange inside a group of structures in series , or in parallel .",
    "the networks for @xmath20 are given in table  [ ta ] .",
    ".two - terminal series - parallel networks for @xmath20 . on each row",
    ", the two networks are dual .",
    "the @xmath21 s ( number of networks ) are 1 , 2 , 4 , 10 ,  the @xmath22 s ( number of essentially series or , by duality , essentially parallel networks ) are 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 ,  [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,<,^ \" , ]",
    "a brief investigation of table  [ li ] shows that @xmath23 .",
    "then , we can define a non - vanishing entropy per element @xmath24 .",
    "more generally , it is expected that the exponential dominant behavior is corrected by sub - leading power - law for large @xmath0 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant .",
    "in fact , in eq .",
    "( [ lomni ] ) , for large @xmath0 , @xmath27 , then @xmath28 .",
    "this last relation is identical apart from a shift @xmath29 to the definition @xmath30 of the catalan numbers @xmath31 $ ] . using the stirling formula",
    ", we see that @xmath32 have the asymptotic behavior of eq .",
    "( [ ra ] ) with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath21 and @xmath32 have the same asymptotic relation do not imply that they have the same @xmath5 . as @xmath35 ,",
    "in the sum , the extremal terms are dominant  : @xmath36",
    ". then the value of @xmath5 strongly depends of the value of the first @xmath32 ( @xmath0 small ) and the exponential increase of @xmath21 and @xmath32 are not described by the same @xmath5 . on the other hand , we expected the same @xmath3 as we see below .",
    "this behavior is common in statistical physics .",
    "the enumeration of random walks , self - avoiding walk , animals , etc .  of @xmath0 step ( or links ) drawn on a regular lattice always exhibits a exponential increase @xmath37 where @xmath5 depend on the connectivity of the lattice , and a sub - leading @xmath38 , where @xmath3 is `` universal '' , i.e. is dependent on the physical nature of the problem ( dimension , phases ,  ) but independent on the details of the lattice .",
    "let us take a big two - terminal series - parallel network .",
    "at each scale , it is `` decorated '' by small parts @xmath22 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "then , the contribution of these small @xmath22 is a large fraction of the total entropy @xmath40 ; they are similar to the connectivity of the lattice and govern the dominant behavior @xmath37 . nevertheless , the sub - leading @xmath38 depends on more general properties and @xmath3 can be see as an `` universal '' exponent .",
    "it described the singularity of the generating function .",
    "we suppose that the @xmath21 have the following large @xmath0 expansion @xmath41 and we want estimate the values of @xmath5 and @xmath3 by numerical extrapolation .",
    "it is more convenient to study @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 by plotting @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 ) _ versus _",
    "@xmath45 , the hypothesis  ( [ expa ] ) is consistent if the data draw a straight line  ; its intersection with the y - axis gives @xmath40 ( resp .",
    "@xmath3 ) .",
    "a more systematic scheme of extrapolation is the richardson polynomial extrapolation process ( brezinski and redivo zaglia 1991 ) . supposing eq .",
    "( [ expa ] ) , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the difference operator @xmath48 .",
    "this method gives the limits ( @xmath5 and @xmath3 ) and show whether the hypothesis  ( [ expa ] ) is consistent or not .",
    "when @xmath49 is large , the acceleration of convergence is faster  ; unfortunately , the numerical instabilities are amplified and after a given @xmath0 , extrapolated values ( eq .  [ dvn ] ) become chaotic . in this work ,",
    "better extrapolations , obtained with @xmath49 between 3 and 5 , are @xmath50    we will now prove that @xmath51 , by examining the behavior of the generating function , which is numerically plotted on fig .  1 .",
    "clearly , the radius of convergence of the series @xmath52 ( i.e. the location of its singularity ) is @xmath53 . at @xmath54 , @xmath55 converges if @xmath56 , and its first derivative @xmath57 diverges if @xmath58 .",
    "then , fig .",
    "1 indicates that @xmath59 .",
    "more generally , the behavior of @xmath60 around @xmath61 is given by @xmath3 .",
    "let us consider the singular part @xmath62 with @xmath63 . for small @xmath64 , @xmath65 / i^\\alpha$ ] . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the sum is dominated by small @xmath67 and @xmath68 , i.e. the first derivative @xmath69 is finite . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the sum is dominated by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the case @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath73 .    rewriting eq .",
    "( [ jat ] ) @xmath74 = { 1\\over 2 } [ a(t ) + t ] + r(t ) \\ \\ \\   { \\rm with }   \\ \\ \\",
    "r(t ) = \\sum_{k \\ge 2 } { 1 \\over 2k } [ a(t^k ) + t^k],\\ ] ] for @xmath75 , @xmath76 is a regular and increasing function . by defining @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the function @xmath79 has a maximum at @xmath80 with @xmath81 and a parabolic shape ( i.e. a finite and negative second derivative ) . as @xmath82",
    ", this gives a singularity for @xmath83 with a square root shape @xmath84 .",
    "this proves that @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately , with this argument , we can not compute the value of @xmath53 , because of the complexity of @xmath76 .",
    "then @xmath5 is sensitive to the details of the regular part of the recurrence  : @xmath5 is not `` universal '' . but @xmath3 depends only of the kind of singularity : it is an `` universal '' exponent .",
    "as we have seen above , it is not surprising that it is equal to the @xmath3 of the catalan numbers .",
    "we have seen that some concepts of statistical physics can be transposed to a problem of graph theory .",
    "the partition function of two - terminal series - parallel networks have an asymptotic behavior similar to those of self - avoiding walks or lattice animals .",
    "its exponential growth depends on details on the model . on the other hand , a power - law correction , with an `` universal '' exponent",
    "can be computed exactly and have a fractional value @xmath85 . for the self - avoiding walks ,",
    "this exponent is sensitive to the dimension and the kind of boundaries conditions and others independent exponents are related to geometrical properties . in our problem",
    ", it will be interesting to have a similar interpretation .",
    "for example , the number of terminal nodes ( two in this article ) could play the role of boundary conditions . by studying quantities like the average depth of elements ( i.e. the number of decomposition needed to isolate this element ) ,",
    "it is probable that new exponents would appear .",
