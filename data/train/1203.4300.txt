    "quantum clock synchronization protocols are of fundamental interest in quantum information , since they can illustrate how information about time is encoded in quantum systems . in general , there are presently two approaches to the problem .",
    "the first is based on the correlations between photon arrival times , or the related arrival times of optical signals detected by homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "the second approach is based on the internal time evolution of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "although the latter approach requires an effective suppression of decoherence and is therefore much more challenging to implement , it might be of greater fundamental interest , since it allows a very general treatment of time in quantum mechanics .",
    "specifically , it can show how the time evolution of quantum systems affects the non - classical correlations between entangled quantum systems .",
    "initially , it was shown that two - party quantum clock synchronization protocols can be used for efficient clock synchronization by using the enhanced sensitivity of bipartite entangled states to small time differences between the measurements performed by the two parties @xcite .",
    "later , krco and paul @xcite extended this idea to a multi party version , where a w - state was used to simultaneously provide bipartite entanglement between a central clock and several other parties .",
    "however , the bipartite entanglement obtained from the w - state decreases rapidly with an increase in the number of clocks .",
    "ben - av and exman @xcite pointed out that this is a weakness of the w - state that can be overcome by using other dicke states instead .",
    "specifically , they showed that the optimal bipartite entanglement for this kind of protocol is obtained by using the symmetric dicke states , where half of the qubits are in the 0 state and half are in the 1 state .",
    "interestingly , none of these protocols uses the specific properties of multipartite entanglement .",
    "the reason for this may be that it is a straightforward matter to measure and evaluate the correlations between two parties , while genuine multi - partite entanglement is characterized by more complicated correlations that involve the measurement results observed at all locations . here ,",
    "we consider the question of whether this different type of entanglement could be used for clock synchronization by constructing a protocol that accesses the maximal entanglement of ghz - type states through an appropriate combination of measurement and communication between the parties .",
    "the result should be significant both for determining the limits of multi party clock synchronization and for our general understanding of time in multi - partite entanglement .    as we discuss below",
    ", a protocol using ghz - type states requires a specific division of the parties into groups during each distribution of the entangled qubits , since there is no ghz - type state that is both an energy eigenstate and symmetric in all parties .",
    "the logic of the two party protocol can then be applied to the collective information of all measurements in the two groups . by selecting an appropriate set of divisions ,",
    "it is thus possible to use the complete entanglement of the ghz - state to efficiently synchronize all n clocks simultaneously . in the following ,",
    "we introduce the protocol , evaluate its efficiency and compare it with the efficiencies obtained from bipartite entanglement in the protocols based on parallel two party synchronization @xcite and on the use of symmetric dicke states @xcite .",
    "here , we consider a type of clock synchronization protocol where entangled qubits are distributed to various parties holding the individual clocks @xcite . each quantum system is described as a two - level spin precessing around the z - axis at a fixed frequency @xmath0 . for experimental realizations",
    ", it would be important to keep decoherence effects to a minimum , e.g. by using nuclear spins precessing in the intrinsic field of a molecule or crystal @xcite .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the present research is not motivated by such technical considerations , but by an interest in the fundamental nature of quantum clocks , as introduced in the semininal work by buzek et al .",
    "@xcite . in this spirit",
    ", we assume that after state preparation , the evolution of the internal spin state only depends on the passage of time . the problem of clock synchronization",
    "can then be reduced to the problem of identifying the time differences between time - dependent measurements performed on the different clocks .    since clock synchronization should not depend on a knowledge of the time needed for state distribution , the multipartite entangled states used should be energy eigenstates .",
    "it is therefore not possible to use ghz states that are superpositions of the two extremal eigenstates of energy , where all qubits are in the same state of their local energy basis . to obtain an energy eigenstate without changing the multipartite entanglement ,",
    "half of the local energy eigenstates should be flipped by appropriate local unitary transformations . if the qubits are arranged so that the first half of the qubits is unflipped and the second half of the qubits is flipped , this @xmath1-partite entangled energy eigenstate can be given in the energy basis as @xmath2 here and in the following , we assume an even number of parties @xmath1 .",
    "the states @xmath3 and @xmath4 are local energy eigenstates with energies @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .    the state given by eq.([maximal entanglement ] ) divides the qubits into two groups . to ensure clock synchronization between all parties , it is necessary that no two parties are always members of the same group .",
    "this is achieved by distributing the qubits in different ways , so that each party sometimes receives a qubit from the unflipped group , and sometimes receives a qubit from the flipped group . to describe each distribution",
    ", we define a sequence @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "if the qubit of the @xmath9 clock owner is a flipped qubit , @xmath10 , if not , @xmath11 . since the numbers of flipped and unflipped qubits are equal , the number of possible distributions @xmath12 is given by the binomial coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "in the most simple version of the protocol , the division into groups can be decided randomly in each run , with equal probabilities for each distribution @xmath12 .",
    "after the distribution of the qubits to the locations of the different clocks , each of the parties measures a time dependent observable @xmath14 on its qubit when their local clock points to a specific time .",
    "the observable measured at a time @xmath15 can be written as @xmath16 the eigenvalues of the measurement outcomes are @xmath17 .",
    "the eigenstates corresponding to the measurement outcomes are equal superpositions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the phase now depends on the time at which the measurement is performed . as a result",
    ", this measurement achieves the maximal time sensitivity for local qubit measurements .",
    "the time sensitivity of the maximal multi - partite entanglement of the ghz - type energy eigenstate given in eq.([maximal entanglement ] ) originates from the coherence between the components @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this coherence , which represents the full multi - partite entanglement of the state , changes the probability of the collective measurement outcome depending on the product of the coherences between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 components in the eigenstates representing the local measurement outcomes . as a result",
    ", the time sensitivity of multi - partite entanglement can be represented by the espectation value for the product of all outcomes , @xmath22 . if the actual measurement times of the parties are given by @xmath23 the expectation value of this product",
    "is @xmath24 since the local measurements represent the maximal time sensitivity for the local qubits , and since the coherence that characterizes multi - parite entanglement of the ghz - type can only be observed in the product of all local measurement outcomes , we can conclude that the time dependence shown in eq.([average number ] ) is the strongest dependence on the measurement outcomes @xmath25 that can be achieved with ghz - type states and local measurements . a protocol that makes use of the time dependent correlations between all of the @xmath26 measurements therefore accesses the full power of maximal multipartite entanglement for clock synchronization .    to access the time sensitivity of the ghz - type state",
    ", all parties must share their measurement results and determine the product of all outcomes .",
    "effectively , the @xmath1 parties cooperate to measure a single @xmath1-particle interference fringe that is sensitive to the collective phase given by @xmath0 times the difference between all measurement times of the unflipped qubits ( @xmath27 ) and the measurement times of all flipped qubits ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "significantly , the use of maximal multi - partite entanglement for clock synchronization critically depends on simultaneous access to all measurement outcomes .",
    "it therefore requires classical communication between all the parties , as indicated in fig .",
    "the full sensitivity of maximal multipartite entanglement only becomes available for use in the clock synchronization process , if all of the parties cooperate .",
    "[ ht ]     , scaledwidth=20.0% ]    in the final step of the synchronization protocol , the clock owners have to estimate the time differences between their respective local clocks and a standard time .",
    "since the present protocol is fully cooperative , with complete symmetry between all parties , it seems natural to define this standard time as the average of all clock times . in the following ,",
    "we therefore discuss the synchronization to average time . to achieve synchronization to a standard clock , one can simply change the adjustments of the time , so that instead of changing his or her own time , the owner of the standard clock makes everyone else subtract his or her time adjustment from theirs .    to ensure that all parties are treated equally , it is possible to use a random distribution of qubits , so that every distribution @xmath29 of flipped and unflipped qubits is equally likely . to keep track of the different distributions , we assign an index @xmath30 to each , so that the elements of each sequence are given by @xmath31 .",
    "the total time difference that defines the phase shift in the multipartite interference fringe observed in the @xmath32 measurement of the distribution with index @xmath30 is then @xmath33 the time differences @xmath34 can be estimated from the outcome statistics of the measurements with an accuracy of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of times that the distribution @xmath30 is received and measured .",
    "after a sufficiently large number of measurements , all parties have the same estimates for all possible time differences @xmath34 .",
    "however , the implications of each @xmath34 are different for each party .",
    "specifically , each party @xmath37 can obtain the difference of times @xmath34 with @xmath38 and the times @xmath34 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , the coefficient in the sum is always @xmath42 , so that the time @xmath25 of the local clock always enters into the sum with a positive value .",
    "since all the other times enter into the sum equally , and since the number of @xmath42 coefficients and @xmath43 coefficients is exactly equal , the result can be expressed in terms of the difference between the time @xmath25 and the average @xmath44 of all times other than @xmath25 , @xmath45 the average of all times @xmath46 is obtained by the weighted average of @xmath25 and @xmath47 times @xmath48 . hence , the difference between the local time @xmath25 and the average time @xmath46 can be given by , @xmath49 after this value is determined by each party , it can be subtracted from each local clock time @xmath25 to adjust the clock times so that they correspond to the average time @xmath46 .",
    "to determine the efficiency of a clock synchronization protocol , it is necessary to evaluate the precision with which the parties can estimate the adjustment time @xmath50 .",
    "in general , this precision is limited by the statistical variance of the measurement results . as mentioned above ,",
    "the estimation errors for the time differences @xmath34 are given by @xmath51 , where @xmath36 is the number of times that the distribution @xmath30 was measured .",
    "since the adjustment times @xmath50 are linear functions of the @xmath34 , it is sufficient to find the sum of the quadratic errors with the appropriate coefficients to obtain the adjustment errors @xmath52 if each distribution @xmath30 is measured an equal number of times , @xmath36 can be expressed as the total number of measurements @xmath53 divided by the number of possible distributions @xmath13 .",
    "likewise , the sum over @xmath30 reduces to a simple multiplication with the number of possibilities . in the end , the estimation error for each adjustment time is given by @xmath54 in the limit of large @xmath1 , this error is simply @xmath55 , independent of the number of parties participating in the clock synchronization .",
    "this means that the maximally multipartite entangled states can be used to synchronize @xmath1 clocks in parallel , without any loss of precision when additional parties are added .",
    "since the parallel synchronization of @xmath1 clocks can also be achieved by performing separate synchronizations of @xmath47 clocks with the same standard clock , it is not immediately clear whether multipartite entanglement has any advantages over multiple bipartite entangled states . in the following ,",
    "we therefore analyze the efficiency of multipartite clock synchronization using the initial proposal for quantum clock synchronization between two parties @xcite .",
    "the complete multi party protocol is illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "there are @xmath1 spatially separated unsynchronized clocks , one of which is the standard clock .",
    "the remaining @xmath47 clock owners synchronize their clocks with this standard clock using bipartite entanglement and classical communication . for this purpose ,",
    "the owner of the central clock must share @xmath47 maximally entangled two qubit states with all of the other parties for each measurement .",
    "effectively , each step of the protocol uses a @xmath56 qubit state given by @xmath57 here , every second qubit is held by the owner of the central clock . at a predetermined time @xmath15 , the owner of the central clock measures the value of @xmath58 on all of her @xmath47 qubits @xmath37 , where @xmath37 is the index of the party that holds the qubit entangled with the qubit @xmath59 .",
    "likewise , the other parties measure the value of @xmath60 on their individual qubits according to their local times @xmath25 .",
    "the central clock then communicates each result of @xmath58 to the party concerned . after a sufficiently large number of measurements @xmath53 , the owner of clock @xmath37",
    "can then determine the expectation value of the product , @xmath61 the clock owners can then determine @xmath62 directly and adjust their clocks accordingly .",
    "[ ht ]     , scaledwidth=20.0% ]    the efficiency of clock synchronization can be evaluated by considering the estimation error @xmath63 for each estimate of adjustment time @xmath62 . for @xmath53 measurements ,",
    "this error is given by @xmath64 .",
    "thus the precision of the time estimates in this protocol is exactly equal to the result for the protocol using multipartite entanglement .",
    "however , the parallel distribution of bipartite entanglement requires @xmath56 qubits for each measurement , as compared to only @xmath1 qubits for the multipartite entangled protocol . in terms of the required number of qubits , the use of multipartite entangled states can thus increase the efficiency by a factor of two . effectively , the main effect of multipartite entanglement seems to be that the need for multiple reference qubits held by the owner of the central clock is removed by allowing the parties to use the @xmath47 qubits of all the other parties as a collective reference instead .",
    "previous multi party clock synchronization protocols were based on parallel clock synchronization using the bipartite entanglement available from w - states @xcite or from symmetric dicke states @xcite . in particular",
    ", ben - av and exman showed that the symmetric dicke state is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the bipartite entanglement between the single qubit held by the owner of the central clock and the qubits held by all of the other parties @xcite .",
    "their protocol is illustrated in fig .",
    "it uses the same measurement and communication procedure as in the parallel distribution of entanglement , but with only a single qubit at the central clock for a total number of @xmath1 qubits per measurement - the same number as our ghz state protocol , and almost half the number of qubits used in the parallel distribution protocol .",
    "[ ht ]     , scaledwidth=20.0% ]    the symmetric dicke states is an equal superposition of all energy eigenstates with half of the qubits in the @xmath18 state and half in the @xmath19 state , @xmath65 the bosonic symmetry of the state means that the qubits tend to be found in the same superposition states of @xmath18 and @xmath66 , resulting in positive correlations between the values of @xmath67 obtained by the different parties at the same time @xmath25 .",
    "specifically , the correlation between the measurement at the central clock and the measurement at clock @xmath37 is given by @xmath68 at the maximal time derivative of the expectation value , the error in the adjustment time @xmath69 for @xmath53 measurements is given by @xmath70 . in the limit of large @xmath1 , this error is equal to twice the error of our ghz state protocol and the parallel distribution protocol .",
    "hence , this protocol requires four times as many qubits to achieve the same accuracy as the ghz state protocol , and twice as many qubits as the parallel distribution protocol .",
    "the reduction in qubit number over parallel distribution of bipartite states is therefore more than offset by the loss of sensitivity in each individual measurement due to the reduction in the available bipartite entanglement .",
    "we can now summarize our results in terms of the accuracy of clock synchronization achieved with a given number of qubits .",
    "since the timescale is defined by the resonant frequency @xmath0 of the qubit dynamics , it is convenient to define the relative accuracy as @xmath71 . for the ghz - type multipartite entanglement ,",
    "the accuracy of @xmath53 measurements using @xmath72 qubits is then given by @xmath73 for high @xmath1 , the accuracy is equal to the number of qubits per party , so the accuracy of the multi party protocol scales linearly with the ratio of qubits and parties , @xmath74 .",
    "significantly , the straightforward extension of the bipartite protocol by parallel distribution of entangled qubit pairs performs only half as well .",
    "specifically , the accuracy of @xmath53 measurements using @xmath75 qubits is @xmath76 the need for extra reference qubits held by the owner of the central clock therefore rapidly reduces the efficiency of each qubit to half the value achieved by the protocol using maximal multipartite entanglement .",
    "finally , the protocol using the simultaneous bipartite entanglement between a single central qubit and @xmath47 others achieves a sensitivity reduced by a factor of @xmath77 due to the reduction in bipartite entanglement associated with the increase in entangled partners for each qubit .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath53 measurements using @xmath78 qubits is therefore @xmath79 in the limit of high @xmath1 , this is a reduction to one quarter of the ghz - type protocol , twice as much as the reduction in accuracy due to the additional reference qubits in the parallel distribution protocol .",
    "we have shown how the maximal @xmath1-partite entanglement of ghz - type stated can be used for multi party clock synchronization by randomly dividing the parties into two groups during each run and sharing the measurement results with all other parties to determine the adjustments necessary to set each local clock to the average time of all clocks .",
    "the accuracy of clock synchronization corresponds to the accuracy achieved by @xmath47 bipartite protocols in parallel , but the number of qubits used is reduced by half .",
    "oppositely , the previously proposed use of symmetric dicke states uses the same number of qubits , but the accuracy is only one quarter due to the reduced amount of bipartite entanglement .",
    "our results show that the full power of maximal multipartite entanglement can improve the performance of clock synchronization by reducing the number of qubits needed to achieve a given accuracy by a factor of two when compared to the most efficient use of bipartite entanglement .",
    "although this is clearly an improvement , it is much less than the improvements of sensitivity when a single parameter is estimated using multi - partite entangled probes .",
    "the reason for this limited improvement is that @xmath1 different clock times must be estimated from the same measurement result , leading to a reduction of precision that exactly compensates the gain caused by the increased sensitivity to an average shift in time . from the viewpoint of an individual clock owner",
    ", multi - partite entanglement merely replaces the single central clock used in parallel clock synchoronization with bipartite entangled states with the collective of all other @xmath47 clock owners .",
    "overall , the efficiency increases by a factor of two , because the simultaneous role of all clock owners as participants and as reference overcomes the need for additional reference qubits . in this sense",
    ", multi - partite entanglement simply represents the simultaneous availability of quantum correlations to all parties , without any increase to the individual time sensitivities .    from a practical viewpoint",
    ", the use of multi - patite entanglement may be difficult , since the loss of a single qubit will completely destroy the essential quantum coherence of the state . to obtain results close to the ones described here",
    ", the probability of local losses or dephasing errors must be kept far below @xmath80 .",
    "oppositely , this sensitivity to decoherence also highlights the cooperative nature of the protocol : if only a single party sends wrong information , the synchronization of the clocks becomes impossible .",
    "thus , clock synchronization with maximal multipartite entanglement also highlights the cooperative nature of multi - party quantum protocols .    in conclusion ,",
    "the analysis presented here shows how the full power of maximal multipartite entanglement can be used to improve the performance of clock synchronization if all of the parties involved cooperate to share their measurement information .",
    "the results may provide interesting insights , both into the role of entanglement in clock synchronization protocols , and into the fundamental nature of time - dependent quantum correlations .",
