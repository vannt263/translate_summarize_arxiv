    "gravitational - wave ( gw ) and high - energy - neutrino observations represent important novel opportunities in studying a variety of cosmic processes , providing complementary information to electromagnetic searches .",
    "they carry information on the origin of high - energy emission as well as the dynamics and structure of the process driving the emission @xcite , which may be difficult to decipher via electromagnetic observations ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gws are produced by the bulk motion of the progenitor , typically carrying information on the dynamics of the source s central region .",
    "high - energy neutrinos , on the other hand , require hadron acceleration in , e.g. , relativistic outflows from a central engine .",
    "astrophysical processes that produce gws may also drive relativistic outflows , which can emit high - energy radiation , such as gev - pev neutrinos or gamma rays . detecting gws along with other forms of radiation from a common source",
    "would shed light on the internal processes within the source , and could increase detection confidence .",
    "the search for common sources of gws and high - energy - neutrino has recently become possible with the construction and upgrade of large - scale observatories .",
    "gw detectors include ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite , which are being upgraded to second - generation detectors @xcite , and geo @xcite , which is currently acquiring data .",
    "another advanced gw detector , kagra @xcite , is being constructed in japan .",
    "the possibility to construct a third advanced ligo observational facility in india is also currently being explored @xcite . with the construction of the advanced ligo detectors finishing in 2015 , multiple detections of gws from compact binary mergers",
    "are expected after 2016 - 2018 @xcite .",
    "high - energy neutrino observatories currently in operation include icecube @xcite  a cubic - kilometer detector at the geographic south pole  and antares @xcite in the mediterranean sea .",
    "antares is planned to be followed by a multi - cubic - kilometer detector in the mediterranean sea called km3net in the following years @xcite .",
    "the baikal neutrino telescope , operating at lake baikal , is also planned to be upgraded to a km@xmath9 volume @xcite .",
    "icecube is also sensitive to low energy ( mev ) thermal neutrinos from nearby supernovae , and contributes to the supernova early warning system ( snews ) network along with several other neutrino detectors , including super - kamiokande @xcite , borexino @xcite , the large volume detector @xcite and the sudbury neutrino observatory @xcite .",
    "high - energy neutrinos of cosmic origin have recently been observed , for the first time , by icecube @xcite .",
    "their detection represents a major step towards multimessenger astronomy . in an all - sky search for the most energetic ( @xmath10tev ) neutrinos",
    ", a total of 28 astrophysical neutrino candidates were identified over a period of 2 years , significantly above the number of expected atmospheric background ( @xmath11 events ) .",
    "the neutrinos have no clear directional or temporal clustering .",
    "while many sources of astrophysical origin have been suggested ( see , e.g. , @xcite , so far there is no compelling evidence for a specific source population .",
    "several classes of astrophysical transients that are detected electromagnetically are also associated with significant gw and high - energy neutrino emission .",
    "these processes include the gamma - ray bursts @xcite , core - collapse supernovae with rapidly rotating cores @xcite , flares from soft gamma repeaters @xcite , or even cosmic string cusps @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are one of the most promising sources for joint gw+neutrino observations .",
    "grbs are intense flashes of @xmath12mev photons of typically extragalactic origin , occurring a few times a day in the observable universe @xcite .",
    "they are thought to be produced in relativistic outflows likely driven by accretion onto a compact object @xcite , or by a rapidly rotating neutron star @xcite .",
    "hadrons accelerated in the relativistic outflows will result in the production of high - energy neutrinos through interaction with photons or other hadrons @xcite .",
    "the central engines that drive the outflow can be formed by ( i ) the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive star , which can also produce supernovae , or by ( ii ) the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole @xcite .",
    "stellar core - collapse with rapidly rotating cores are thought to be the origin of long ( @xmath13s ) grbs .",
    "they can lead to gw emission via , e.g. , rotational instabilities in the newly formed protoneutron stars , non - axisymmetric instabilities of the accretion disk , or the fragmentation of the collapsing core .",
    "compact binary neutron star or neutron - star - black - hole mergers are thought to be the progenitors of short ( @xmath14s ) grbs @xcite .",
    "they emit strong gws as the two compact objects inspiral and merge , in the sensitive frequency band of ligo / virgo @xcite .",
    "another promising source type , soft - gamma repeaters ( sgr ) , are sources of short bursts of gamma rays emitted at irregular intervals .",
    "they occasionally emit giant gamma - ray / x - ray flares that can be detected from the milky way or nearby galaxies within a few megaparsecs , at a rate lower than the grb rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sgrs are thought to be highly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "their gamma outbursts may be a consequence of the tectonic activity of the neutron star crust ( starquake ) .",
    "the seismic vibration of a neutron star following a starquake gives rise to gw emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "tectonic activity in the neutron star is followed by the reconfiguration of the neutron star s magnetic fields , resulting in x - ray and gamma - ray radiation @xcite .",
    "sudden magnetic reconfiguration may also accelerate protons and other nuclei , leading to the production of high - energy neutrinos @xcite .    for joint gw+neutrino detection , a particularly interesting subset of these sources are those that have faint electromagnetic emission , such as choked grbs @xcite for which the relativistic outflow stalls before it can break out of the stelar envelope , and low - luminosity grbs with mildly relativistic ejecta @xcite .",
    "the coincident detectability of gws and high - energy neutrinos , and the scientific potential of such searches , was first recognized in @xcite , and later independently in @xcite .",
    "the population of cosmic events producing both gws and high - energy neutrino emission was first constrained observationally @xcite with data from the initial ligo - virgo detectors and the partially completed icecube detector ( see section [ section : rateul ] ) .",
    "while the population of cosmic events expected to produce detectable joint emission falls below these early observational limits , the results were used to estimate the projected upper limits achievable with advanced gw detectors and the completed icecube , which can provide meaningful constraints or detection .",
    "a search for coincident gws and high - energy neutrinos has recently been carried out using the initial ligo - virgo observatories and the partially completed antares detector @xcite .",
    "the search found no significant coincident events .",
    "antares is mainly sensitive to tev neutrino sources from the southern hemisphere , making this a complementary search to that performed with icecube , which is mainly sensitive to the northern hemisphere at tev energies .    recognizing the scientific potential of multimessenger observations , various initiatives aim to use gws and neutrinos in combination with electromagnetic observations .",
    "for instance , multiple astrophysical event candidates from both the initial ligo - virgo detectors @xcite and icecube have been followed up by em telescopes : quest , tarot , zadko , pi of the sky , rotse , skymapper , the palomar transient factory , and the swift satellite .",
    "sub - threshold grb candidates detected through gamma - rays are also being used for searches for coincident gw signals @xcite . the snews network @xcite aims to use sub - threshold mev neutrino signals from neutrino observatories around the world to trigger electromagnetic follow - up searches for supernovae .",
    "the network utilizes the fact that neutrinos arrive up to several hours earlier than the detectable electromagnetic signal from supernovae , as was the case for the first confirmed astronomical mev neutrino source , sn1987a @xcite .",
    "a current initiative for multimessenger searches in the weak - signal limit is the proposed astrophysical multimessenger observatory network ( amon ; @xcite ) .",
    "amon is planned to perform a real - time correlation analysis of sub - threshold signals from available astronomical messengers ; photons , low and high - energy neutrinos , cosmic rays , and gws .",
    "these sub - threshold triggers will be used to ( 1 ) increase the detectable number of sources and ( 2 ) trigger follow - up searches that can further enhance the significance of a potential coincident detection .    in this paper",
    "we present a multimessenger search for joint sources of gws and high - energy neutrinos using the initial ligo and virgo gw detectors together with the partially complete icecube detector in its 22 , 59 and 79-string configurations .",
    "the analysis is based on the method described in @xcite . in section [ section : multianalysis ] we briefly review the search method and data - analysis details . in section [ section : results ] we present the results .",
    "observing no evidence of a gw+neutrino event we set upper limits on the rate of gw+neutrino sources as a function of the source energy budget .",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss the outlook for future observations in section [ section : discussion ] .",
    "in this section we present the status of gw and neutrino observations and the analysis we used to combine their results ; a more detailed description of the method can be found in @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we use the word  neutrinos \" to refer exclusively to high - energy neutrinos .      ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite are km - scale interferometric gw observatories .",
    "ligo has two michelson interferometers in the u.s .",
    ", both with 4-km arm length . one of the detectors is in hanford , washington ( which we refer to as h1 ) , while the other one is located in livingston , louisiana ( which we refer to as l1 ) . during the 2005 - 2007 observation period",
    ", an additional detector with 2-km arm length was operating at the hanford site ( which we refer to as h2 ) .",
    "h2 s location and orientation were identical to that of h1 .",
    "the ligo detectors were sensitive to gws in the frequency band of @xmath15hz .",
    "virgo is a michelson interferometer with 3-km arm length ( which we refer to as v1 ) , located near cascina , italy .",
    "virgo is sensitive to gws in a frequency band similar to that of ligo . for the present search",
    ", data from initial virgo s three observation periods ( vsr1 - 3 ) were used .",
    "ligo and virgo detect gws by monitoring the relative displacement of test masses ( mirrors ) .",
    "an incoming gw changes the distance between test masses with an amount proportional to their distance . the detectors measure the fractional difference @xmath16 between the lengths of the two interferometer arms @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , which is referred to as strain .",
    "the two gw polarizations , denoted with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , independently contribute to the detector strain .",
    "the detector strain also depends on the relative orientation of the detector and the gw , which is described by so - called antenna response factors @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical reach of gw detectors can be characterized , e.g. , by the so - called horizon distance : the maximum distance at which the gw signal from an optimally oriented and optimally located source can be detected , with detection defined as a single - detector signal - to - noise ratio of 8 . it is easiest to establish this horizon distance for compact binary mergers for which the gravitational waveform is known to sufficient precision .",
    "this horizon distance reached tens of megaparsecs for the initial ligo - virgo detectors @xcite .",
    "the gw output , and therefore the horizon distances , of stellar core collapse with rapidly rotating cores and sgr starquakes are less certain @xcite . adopting an optimistic standard - siren gw emission with energy @xmath25m@xmath1c@xmath2 and frequency @xmath26hz ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "such a gw signal could be detected out to @xmath27mpc with initial ligo - virgo .",
    "for sgrs , the gw counterpart of giant flares may be detectable , in the most optimistic scenarios , from within the galaxy @xcite .",
    "for the present search , data from the initial ligo detectors fifth ( s5 ) and sixth ( s6 ) observation periods were used . during the s5/vsr1 observation period ,",
    "a small fraction of the data was taken with only the h1 , l1 and v1 detectors , i.e. without h2 .",
    "given that this period was significantly shorter than when \\{h1,h2,l1,v1 } were operational , and for simplicity , we exclude this period from the present analysis .",
    "the ligo s5 observation period started on november 4 , 2005 and ended on october 1 , 2007 , while s6 lasted from july 7 , 2009 until october 20 , 2010 .",
    "virgo vsr1 started on may 18 , 2007 and ended on october 1 , 2007 .",
    "virgo vsr2 ran from july 7 , 2009 to january 11 , 2010 , while virgo vsr3 ran from august 11 , 2010 to october 20 , 2010 .",
    "the observational periods of ligo and virgo used in this analysis are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ figure : observationalperiods ] in comparison to icecube .",
    "the three gw search periods have similar noise spectra and have comparable sensitivities . the s6 period having a nominal factor of @xmath28 lower background noise level than the s5 period .    in the present analysis ,",
    "we only use data when all available detectors were operational .",
    "this means that for the s5 observation period , data is analyzed only if h1 , h2 , l1 and v1 were operational , while for the s6 observation period , we require h1 , l1 and v1 to be operational . the total duration of such data taking period for s5/vsr1 , in coincidence with icecube in its 22-strings configuration ( ic22 ) is @xmath29days .",
    "there are @xmath30 days of coincident data between s6-vsr2 and icecube in its 59-string configuration ( ic59 ) and @xmath31 days of coincident data for s6-vsr3 and icecube in its 79-string configuration ( ic79 ) .",
    "we analyze gw data from the ligo - virgo observatories using the _ coherent waveburst _ ( cwb ) analysis pipeline @xcite .",
    "the cwb pipeline searches for short gw transients with durations @xmath32s in the [ 64hz , 2048hz ] frequency range , which includes the most sensitive frequency band of ligo and virgo ( @xmath3hz ) .",
    "the pipeline looks for  generic \" gw signals within this frequency range , with no further constraints on their waveform @xcite .",
    "the cwb pipeline coherently combines information from all gw detectors to perform a constrained maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "the output of the pipeline is a list of astrophysical gw signal candidates , which we will refer to as gw events .    for each gw event",
    ", cwb records its ( i ) time of arrival , ( ii ) test statistic @xmath33 and ( iii ) directional distribution .",
    "the test statistic of a gw event is the coherent network amplitude @xmath33 , which is proportional to the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the directional distribution is specified within @xmath34 size pixels .",
    "the significance of each event is used to calculate the gw false alarm rate ( far@xmath35 ) , that is , the frequency of occurrence of events from background alone with a greater significance . in this analysis",
    "we consider only those gw events whose far@xmath35 , based on their significance , is @xmath36day@xmath8 .",
    "this far@xmath35 was used for electromagnetic follow - up observations of gw events .",
    "the @xmath33 values corresponding to far@xmath35@xmath37day@xmath8 for the three observation periods are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . note that the different value for s5/vsr1 is due to the fact that the h2 detector is also used there .",
    "the icecube neutrino observatory @xcite , located near the south pole , is a cubic - kilometer cherenkov detector optimized to detect neutrinos at the tev - pev energy scale .",
    "the full detector consists of 86 vertical strings , with a set of 60 digital optical modules ( doms ) on each string .",
    "these doms are used to detect cherenkov light from neutrino - induced charged particles .",
    "the present search uses observational data from icecube during its construction period , which can be characterized with the number of strings deployed at the time of the observation .",
    "deployment was performed only during austral summers , resulting in extended @xmath41yr observation periods using a constant number of deployed strings ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : observationalperiods ] ) .",
    "icecube detects neutrinos through the cherenkov photons from secondary charged particles . for the present search ,",
    "the secondary particles are muons , which , at @xmath42gev energies , travel long enough in ice before decaying for an accurate direction reconstruction .",
    "we apply the neutrino event selection of the standard icecube point source analysis @xcite . due to the large flux of muons produced by cosmic ray interactions within the atmosphere , the search is constrained to muons moving upward through the detector . as the earth is opaque to muons ,",
    "atmospheric muons are filtered out in these directions .",
    "the remaining background is due to atmospheric neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere , and which produce muons in the ice around or within the detector .",
    "the direction of the secondary muons are reconstructed to a precision of @xmath43 in the tev - pev energy range @xcite . at these energies ,",
    "the difference between the direction of the incoming neutrino and the secondary muon is negligible .",
    "astrophysical neutrinos from individual sources can be identified by a localized excess in space and/or time above the atmospheric background .",
    "the energy spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos can also be used to differentiate between the background and astrophysical signals .",
    "neutrinos produced in the atmosphere have a soft energy spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) with a power law spectral index of @xmath44 above @xmath45gev , compared to the harder astrophysical spectrum , with a spectral index of @xmath46 due to the expected fermi acceleration of protons in the grb outflow @xcite .",
    "the present search uses high - energy neutrino data from the icecube neutrino observatory in its 22 , 59 and 79-string configurations .",
    "neutrino data was recorded with the 22-string configuration from may 31 , 2007 to april 4 , 2008 .",
    "icecube recorded data with its 59-string configuration from may 20 , 2009 to may 30 , 2010 , and with its 79-string configuration from may 31 , 2010 to may 12 , 2011 .",
    "the observational periods of icecube used in this analysis are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ figure : observationalperiods ] in comparison to the observation periods of ligo and virgo .",
    "the number of detected astrophysical neutrino candidates for the three observation periods , as well as their subsets that were detected during times when h1 , l1 and v1 gw detectors were operational , are shown in table [ table : neutrinos ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above results also highlight the importance of gw detector characterization efforts .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ figure : farefficiency ] that decreasing the far reduces the efficiency of the gw - only search much more significantly than that of the joint search , due to the non - gaussian tail of the background gw event distribution . for a @xmath47 discovery over a 1-year observation period ,",
    "assuming that the fit curve is valid for higher test statistic values , the required gw test statistic would need to be @xmath48 .",
    "this value is outside of the scale of the injections we performed , and shows that the non - gaussian tail of the gw background distribution makes it difficult to raise the significance of a gw event .",
    "this result exemplifies that addressing the heavy - tail background distribution in gw detectors , e.g. , in the context of detector characterization , will be critical for gw - only searches .",
    "to compare the gw+neutrino search to the neutrino - only case , we emphasize that the joint search is in principle capable of detecting joint events with a single detected neutrino",
    ". a neutrino - only search , in the same time , would require at least 3 directionally and temporally coincident neutrinos for detection , without any electromagnetic or other counterpart ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to compare the gw+neutrino and neutrino - only cases , we consider the difference between the characteristic distances from which 1 or 3 neutrinos are detected from a given source . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case in which the respective detection probability is @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be the distance at which the probability of detecting at least one neutrino from a given source is @xmath49 .",
    "this corresponds to an average of @xmath51 detected neutrinos .",
    "for the same source , detecting 3 or more neutrinos with @xmath49 probability corresponds to an average of @xmath52 detected neutrinos .",
    "the ratio between the characteristic distances of the neutrino - only search and the gw+neutrino search ( given a gw trigger ) is therefore @xmath53 corresponding to a search volume increase of a factor of @xmath54 .",
    "note that beaming will be the same for the neutrino - only and the gw+neutrino search , it will therefore not affect this difference .",
    "for the gw+neutrino case , a limitation will come from the finite distance from which gws can be detected ( up to hundreds of megaparsecs for advanced gw detectors , depending on the source s gw emission ) .",
    "following icecube s recent detection of @xmath55tev astrophysical neutrinos @xcite , it is beneficial to consider the extension of the present gw+neutrino search in this direction .",
    "while some of the @xmath55tev neutrinos have poor localization as they show a cascade - like hit - pattern in the detector , the present analysis pipeline can incorporate this limited direction reconstruction , as well as the temporal coincidence , to find joint gw+neutrino events .",
    "we compared the time of arrival of the @xmath55tev neutrinos detected by icecube to the time periods when ligo - virgo were operational . while some of the neutrinos were detected during the nominal ligo - virgo observation periods , in the present search we considered only times for which at least three detectors were operational .",
    "none of the @xmath55tev neutrinos had such triple coincidence .",
    "while this means that we presently did not determine meaningful limits on joint sources of gws and @xmath55tev neutrinos , these searches can present an interesting direction for the advanced gw detector era , even in its early stages with limited gw direction reconstruction capabilities .",
    "we searched for common transient sources of gws and high - energy neutrinos using the initial ligo and virgo gw observatories ( s5 - 6/vsr1 - 3 observation periods ) along with the partially completed icecube neutrino detector ( 22 , 59 , and 79 strings ) .",
    "we found no sufficiently significant joint event to claim detection .",
    "we used the results to derive a limit on the rate of common sources for a range of gw and neutrino emission parameters .",
    "taking the standard - siren gw emission with @xmath56m@xmath1c@xmath2 around @xmath57hz and a neutrino emission energy @xmath58erg comparable to typical grb gamma - ray emission , we constrain the source rate below @xmath59mpc@xmath7yr@xmath8 .",
    "while these results do not constrain current astrophysical models , we establish a baseline for future measurements by advanced gw detectors .",
    "we project a source rate upper limit of @xmath60mpc@xmath7yr@xmath8 for a 1-year observation period with advanced ligo / virgo and the full icecube , which is comparable to the core - collapse supernova rate .",
    "we investigated the improvement of a gw+neutrino search over single - messenger searches with respect to ( i ) the obtained source rate upper limit and ( ii ) search sensitivity .",
    "we characterized the latter as the prospects of identifying an astrophysical signal with low far , which is necessary for discovery .",
    "for the first time we carried out a comparison with low far ( 1/100yr ) .",
    "we found that the gw+neutrino search performs significantly better than a gw - only search .",
    "compared to the extrapolated gw background distribution , the horizon distance of the gw+neutrino search increased by a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "this difference further increases with decreasing far .",
    "this demonstrates that the added information from multiple astronomical messengers will be especially important for high - significance detections .",
    "the difference for these detections is more pronounced than for source rate upper limits that allow higher far .",
    "our results further indicate that the heavy - tail distribution of the gw - event test statistic limits the prospects of high - significance single - messenger detections , making gw detector characterization a critical step in increasing sensitivity for advanced gw detectors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for characterizing the different sensitivities of gw+neutrino and neutrino - only searches , we find that the possibility of detection even with 1 observed neutrino for the joint analysis increases the search volume by a factor of @xmath54 compared to neutrino - only searches that require at least 3 coincident neutrinos for detection .",
    "this increased volume , nevertheless , may be limited by the range of gw detection .",
    "the search algorithm developed for this analysis is readily usable with data from any number of advanced gw detectors and with neutrino observatories such as icecube or km3net .",
    "observations may be especially interesting with early advanced gw detectors with only two operational observatories .",
    "the search can also be used to search for the highest - energy ( @xmath12pev ) neutrinos coincident with gw signals , even with limited directional information .    with icecube now completed and with the construction of advanced ligo - virgo finishing within a year",
    ", the next generation of multimessenger searches can commence soon , expanding our reach towards the high - energy , transient phenomena .",
