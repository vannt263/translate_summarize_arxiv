    "strong gravitational lensing can be used to study a number of important astrophysical topics , ranging from the mass distribution within galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to magnifying distant sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to cosmography ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for extensive references ) .    the power of lensing as a tool for astrophysics stems from its ability to measure mass independent of its dynamical state , as well as from its ability to magnify background sources .",
    "detailed mass models of the deflector galaxies , groups , or clusters of galaxies can be determined by reproducing the strong lensing observables , i.e. multiple image time delays , positions , and fluxes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . however , one of the main limitations of gravitational lensing is due to the so - called `` mass - sheet degeneracy '' @xcite .",
    "this emerges from considering the solution to the lens equation , characterized by a certain surface mass density @xmath7 for the deflector in units of the critical density @xmath8 . by linear transformations",
    ", one finds that an infinite family of solutions can be obtained .",
    "the family of solutions results in a range of inferred properties both for the mass model of the main deflector as well as for the properties of the lensed source .",
    "one needs to break the mass - sheet degeneracy using physical arguments in order to fully exploit the power of gravitational lensing .",
    "a number of strategies have been adopted to break this degeneracy both in the strong and weak lensing regimes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a common strategy is requiring the surface mass density of the main deflector to vanish at large distances from its center .",
    "this solution is physically equivalent to assuming that the distribution of mass along the line of sight ( los ) , excluding the plane of the main deflector , is uniform and equal to the average of the universe .",
    "this approximation is sufficient for many applications of gravitational lensing , resulting typically in uncertainties of only a few percent in the inferred mass distribution of the main deflector and in the luminosity and size of the lensed source @xcite . for higher precision measurements",
    "however , one needs to determine the effects of the line of sight mass distribution .",
    "it is customary to condense these effects into an equivalent additional mass sheet at the redshift of the main deflector with uniform surface mass density @xmath0 , which can be positive or negative depending on whether the line of sight is over or underdense with respect to the average of the universe @xcite . in practice ,",
    "mass - sheet degeneracy can be broken , i.e. , the value of @xmath0 can be inferred , by constraining in an independent way ( 1 ) the mass of the lens galaxy via stellar kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and/or ( 2 ) the total mass of any intervening mass structures along the line of sight via imaging and spectroscopy of objects along the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "determining @xmath0 is especially important for doing precision cosmography with gravitational lens time delays .",
    "gravitational lens time delays are the difference in the arrival time of photons along the paths corresponding to multiple images arising from geometric and general relativistic effects . for variable sources , like active galactic nuclei",
    ", time delays can be measured via dedicated monitoring campaigns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the mass distribution in the plane of the deflector and along the line of sight is known , the measured time delays can be converted to the so - called time - delay distance @xmath9 , a combination of three angular diameter distances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in turn , the time - delay distance contains information on cosmological parameters , primarily the hubble constant @xmath10 @xcite , but also the curvature and other parameters @xcite .",
    "to first approximation , time delays constrain cosmology in a similar way to baryon acoustic oscillation experiments and therefore are an excellent complement to other probes like the cosmic microwave background and type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that with current techniques and sufficient ancillary data a single gravitational lens measures the time - delay distance to approximately @xmath11-@xmath12% @xcite .    in cases like b1608@xmath3656  where the time delays are known to @xmath22% and the mass model of the main deflector and its immediate environment",
    "is exquisitely constrained by the data , the dominant source of uncertainty is the distribution of mass along the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. effectively the external convergence @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , @xmath13 .",
    "thus , for small @xmath0 , the uncertainty @xmath4 translates directly into relative uncertainty in time - delay distance , currently dominating the overall error budget .",
    "@xcite constrained @xmath0 by using the density of galaxies within @xmath14 of b1608@xmath3656 , which was measured to be twice that of an average field observed at the same depth by @xcite .",
    "then , by selecting lines of sight with the same galaxy overdensity @xmath15 in the millennium ray - tracing simulations of @xcite , they measured the conditional probability distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath16 , which was then used as a prior in deriving cosmological information .",
    "several efforts are underway to explore ways to further reduce this source of uncertainty .",
    "those include spectroscopic and photometric surveys @xcite as well as measurements of the external shear @xcite    in this paper we focus on refining and developing practical tools to estimate external convergence by comparing the output of cosmological numerical simulations with readily available observables such as those that can be derived from a galaxy photometric catalog .",
    "we define the relative overdensity @xmath17 as the value of selected observables related to the stellar mass , the redshift , and the projected distance on the sky ( angular distance ) divided by the mean of the same observables over all lines of sight . extending the work of  @xcite we consider a set of observables with relative overdensities @xmath17 in addition to @xmath15 , the number of galaxies along a los divided by the average , seeking observables that minimize @xmath4 . in a companion paper , collett et al .",
    "( 2013 , submitted ) a halo - model approach is used to perform a full reconstruction of the mass distribution along the line of sight , and thus provide a theoretical counterpart to the methods and weighting schemes developed here .",
    "the main result of this paper is that using these statistics it is possible to reduce significantly @xmath4 , using a multiband photometric catalog .",
    "the amount of gain depends on the specific line of sight , but for a system like b1608 + 656 it is possible to reduce it from 6 to 5% ( even 4% in the best cases ) .",
    "we note that even reducing the uncertainty on a single lens from 5 to 4% is extremely useful given how rare these strong lenses are and how time - consuming it is to obtain ancillary data like time delays and high - resolution images .",
    "oversimplifying for the purpose of illustration , assuming a target precision of 1% from a sample of lenses , only 16 systems would be needed if each were precise to 4% , as opposed to 25 systems at 5% precision each ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : millenium ] we briefly summarize the millennium simulation that forms the backbone of our study . in section  [ sec :",
    "counts ] we revisit the galaxy count statistic @xmath15 . in section  [ sec : weights ] we introduce other statistics involving stellar mass , luminosity , redshift , and distance . in section  [ sec : observations ] we test the influence of using photometric redshifts instead of spectroscopic redshifts in our method . in section",
    "[ sec : fields ] we apply our method for several statistics to the gravitational lens b1608@xmath3656 . throughout the paper magnitudes",
    "are given on the vega scale .",
    "numerical simulations of large - scale structure provide a way to determine statistically the amount of external convergence for a lens system . by ray tracing through the millennium simulation @xcite",
    ", one can produce a simulated image of the sky populated with galaxies and a corresponding map of the external convergence , @xmath0 , for a given source redshift @xcite .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 values associated with lines of sight in the simulation that resemble the lens system of interest ( e.g. , in terms of the overdensity of galaxies around the lens system ) provides a statistical estimate of the @xmath0 for the lens system .",
    "we use 64 simulated fields of @xmath18 deg@xmath19 from the millennium simulation containing galaxies with positions , redshifts , magnitudes ( in sdss u , g , r , i , z and 2mass j , h , k ) and stellar masses from the semianalytic galaxy model of @xcite .",
    "each field has approximately 5 million galaxies with redshifts up to @xmath20 and an associated map of the external convergence on a @xmath21 grid for a source redshift of 1.4 , typical of strong lensing systems like b1608@xmath3656 .",
    "we use each position on the @xmath0 map as a line of sight , and therefore have approximately @xmath22 lines of sight for the 64 fields . @xcite and @xcite showed that the distribution of @xmath0 from strong lens lines of sight are very similar to the distribution for all lines of sight constructed from the millennium simulation excludes the convergence at the primary lens plane ( i.e. , the redshift of the lens galaxy ) since this is already accounted for in the lens galaxy mass modeling . therefore , the external convergence is truly external to the lens and is due to line - of - sight contributions . ] .",
    "therefore , we consider all lines of sight from the 64 fields in our analysis .",
    "these lines of sight provide the pool from which we select subsets that have observational properties ( based on the galaxies ) matching those of the lens system for determining the @xmath0 of the lens .",
    "in this section we revisit the galaxy overdensity statistic introduced by @xcite .",
    "we recall that the use of relative overdensities  instead of absolute densities  in both the data and simulations is meant to minimize the impact of theoretical and observational systematic uncertainties . in particular this",
    "should reduce sensitivity to the choice of a specific reference simulation  @xcite .    in practice , we study @xmath16 , where @xmath15 is given by the number of galaxies within @xmath14 , @xmath23 , in a specific line of sight , divided by the average value for all lines of sight , @xmath24 ; i.e. @xmath25 . for the millennium",
    "simulation data , @xmath24 is readily computed by multiplying the total number of galaxies by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the angular area of the entire field . however , in practice one must be careful of masked regions and edge effects .",
    "the choice of the radius is motivated by practical reasons . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "this is typically the maximum radius that can be surveyed for a target in middle of one of the two chips , i.e. the standard pointing of the wide field camera of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "we also impose restrictions similar to observations of b1608@xmath3656  such that all galaxies must have @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the source redshift of b1608@xmath3656 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and following @xcite , have @xmath31 .",
    "the results found by @xcite used only the latter constraint . in section",
    "[ sec : fields ] , we revisit this field with redshift information . once the pdfs of @xmath0 are computed we define the width of the pdf @xmath4 as the semidifference of the 84 and 16 percentiles of @xmath16 .",
    "we remind the reader that in this paper we use the convergence maps detailed in section  [ sec : millenium ] to supply our @xmath0 values .",
    "the @xmath0 pdf for a los with a known relative overdensity in galaxy count is readily computed by first counting @xmath23 for each line of sight on the convergence maps .",
    "the convergence maps are defined on a regular grid with resolution of @xmath23.5@xmath32 , and the grid points thus conveniently serve as locations of the lines of sight for our galaxy number counts .",
    "then , it is sufficient to select lines of sight with overdensity close to the desired value @xmath15 . in practice",
    ", we select all lines of sight with @xmath33 where @xmath34 , the interval width , is some integer value . as we increase @xmath34 , the number of lines of sight satisfying equation ( [ eq : ncon ] )",
    "also increases . as a general rule",
    "the parameter @xmath34 should be chosen to be as small as possible while still leaving sufficient lines of sight to generate the pdf .",
    "note that sample variance noise is already introduced by the simulations so we expect that varying @xmath34 while keeping it smaller than @xmath35 should not affect our results .",
    "a number of subtleties must be taken into account when constructing the @xmath0 pdfs . as expected ,",
    "the distributions are in general highly skewed . for example , fewer lines of sight become available at higher relative overdensities ( and similarly at lower underdensities ; for conciseness we shall discuss explicitly only the overdensities in our examples ) .",
    "because the number of lines of sight @xmath36 at a given galaxy count @xmath23 are always greater than that at @xmath37 , simply constructing a pdf from all @xmath0 whose corresponding @xmath23 satisfy equation ( [ eq : ncon ] ) would be biased towards lower @xmath23 , and their respective @xmath0 values .",
    "we define @xmath38 as the median @xmath0 for a given pdf , and find that a good indicator of the bias in a sample is the change in @xmath38 as function of the interval width @xmath34 .",
    "the narrowest interval @xmath39 gives the closest estimate to the true median .",
    "since lower @xmath23 pull the entire pdf away from that with a galaxy count of @xmath40 , we expect that a notable change in @xmath38 will occur when we increase @xmath34 .",
    "this is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : echarts ] . to circumvent this shift in @xmath38 that would lead to a bias in the time - delay distance determination , we weight each value of @xmath0 by @xmath41 for its respective @xmath23  that is , we find @xmath36 for the @xmath23 responsible for contributing a particular @xmath0 , and multiply by the inverse .",
    "therefore each of the @xmath42 @xmath0 pdfs for a given @xmath23 within @xmath43 carries equal weight , and @xmath0 from higher @xmath23 offset those from lower , thus ensuring that our overall distribution remains relatively static .",
    "this is indeed the case , as the bottom panel of figure [ fig : echarts ] shows @xmath38 declines much more slowly as a function of uncertainty than in the upper panel .",
    "however , maintaining a steady median has resulted in increasing the width of the distribution @xmath4 .",
    "this is expected because pdfs on either side of @xmath40 are centered slightly above or below our target .",
    "for this reason  and that of residual effects on the median  we see that lower galaxy interval widths ( @xmath34 ) offer the best results , assuming they can encompass sufficient data to adequately reduce statistical uncertainty . for the purposes of this paper",
    "unless otherwise noted we set @xmath44 .    as an illustration of our method , in this paper",
    "we investigate the underdense case @xmath45 and the overdense cases @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ( used in figure [ fig : echarts ] ) , although our method carries over to any arbitrary value of @xmath15 .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : kappapdf ] the pdf of @xmath0 for these @xmath15 values .",
    "as expected , larger @xmath15 produces a shift in the pdf along positive @xmath0 , however , it also increases @xmath4 .",
    "in other words more overdense lines of sight have higher convergence but also a broader range of possible convergences . in the study of @xcite , b1608@xmath3656  possessed a relative overdensity of 2.18 without redshift cuts .",
    "we will thus look at the case of @xmath48 with particular interest .",
    "defining @xmath49 is useful for constructing pdfs of @xmath0 for strong lenses . counting @xmath50 for any line of sight is straightforward and requires only that each object within @xmath14 have @xmath51 and a flux greater than an observational limit .",
    "however , by using @xmath23 we neglect characteristics of an object that may play a significant role in gravitational lensing ( i.e. mass , redshift , angular offset ) . by using quantities that are closely related to lensing",
    "we expect that we should be able to reduce the uncertainty on @xmath0 .",
    "for example , we do not suspect all los with @xmath48 to have exactly the same physical characteristics as b1608@xmath3656 , hence we can use relative overdensities in observable features besides @xmath23 to construct an even tighter - and perhaps more relevant - pdf .      to identify los with overdensities with particular features ,",
    "we need to design a weighting scheme such that all objects are not equivalent , but weighted by a feature relevant to lensing . by summing each object multiplied by its weight within @xmath14",
    "we define the weighted sum @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the weight for object @xmath54 .",
    "note that for our definition of @xmath23 , @xmath55 for all @xmath54 and therefore the weighted number of galaxies @xmath56 simply corresponds to @xmath23 .",
    "we next define @xmath57 as before . in accordance with @xmath15",
    ", we will set @xmath58 , and @xmath47 for the purpose of demonstrating our general method .",
    "the angular separation between the source and a nearby object is a significant factor in distorting , and thereby shaping , the path through which the source s light passes . we expect then that each galaxy within @xmath14 does not contribute equally , but that those nearer the optical axis of the lens are more influential than those farther away .",
    "in particular for isothermal total mass distributions ( appropriate for massive galaxies or around the scale radius of halos , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect the convergence to decline as the inverse projected distance from the deflector .",
    "this gives rise to our first weighting method of @xmath59 .",
    "we will scale all objects that satisfy @xmath60 by @xmath59 . at @xmath61 weighting",
    "becomes sensitive to small changes in @xmath62 .",
    "thus for @xmath61 we allow each object to carry a weight of @xmath63 , giving us a continuous weighting function .",
    "we note that in general objects that are very close to the main deflector are more likely to be physically associated with it and exert a stronger impact ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore it is prudent to model them explicitly , rather than considering them as part of the statistical lines of sight effect .",
    "this might require obtaining as much information as possible on them , including redshifts @xcite and possibly stellar velocity dispersions , especially if they are consistent with massive galaxies .",
    "objects close to the source along the line of sight have minimal lensing effects from the scaled deflection of light rays . likewise , those nearest to the observer are relatively insignificant . in order to approximately account for this , our next heuristic weighting method is quadratic in @xmath64 and defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath64 are the redshifts of the source and the object along the los , respectively . for simplicity",
    "the notation of this weighting method is `` @xmath64 ''",
    ".      the most massive galaxies will produce detectable lensing effects over a larger area of the sky .",
    "thus we choose one of the weighting methods to be @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the object",
    "s stellar mass and @xmath69 is some positive integer .",
    "the rationale for this scaling is that at the high mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function , the relation between stellar mass and total mass is non - linear . according to , e.g. , weak lensing , clustering , satellites , and abundance matching studies , the total mass increases with stellar mass faster than linear in for the most massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the central galaxies of massive clusters and poor groups do not typically differ in stellar mass by orders of magnitude even though their halos do . for @xmath67 with @xmath70 we will consider both @xmath71 and @xmath72{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{\\rm gal } } m_{i}^{n}}$ ] .",
    "the former will be denoted as @xmath73 while the latter as the root sum of the squares @xmath74 . in this paper",
    "we explore the cases of @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in this section",
    "we assume to know precisely the correct masses , as given by the millennium catalog ; in section  [ sec : observations ] we allow each mass to depend on its respective photometric redshift to assess the reliability of a @xmath67 weighting method .      in practice , inferring the stellar mass of an object with limited observational data can be difficult , leading to large uncertainties . for this purpose",
    "we will also explore weighting by luminosity , @xmath77 .",
    "we now proceed with the method outlined in section  [ sec : counts ] , requiring that @xmath58 , or @xmath47 for all aforementioned @xmath78 .",
    "contour plots for @xmath79 versus @xmath15 given in figure [ fig : contours ] show how the various relative overdensities are related .",
    "because each weighting scheme differs in @xmath80 from every other , we would like to ensure that keeping a consistent interval width @xmath34 does not affect our relative spread .",
    "weighting schemes with low @xmath80 would offer a higher percentage of total lines of sight than those with large @xmath80 . to normalize our spread",
    "we multiply each @xmath81 by @xmath82 . thus , we generalize equation ( [ eq : ncon ] ) to the following for new statistics : @xmath83 furthermore , @xmath81 is no longer restricted to discrete integer values , but rather a continuum .",
    "still , we expect @xmath84 at under- and overdense @xmath79 so it is necessary to normalize by the inverse number of los .",
    "we allow @xmath42 bins , each of length 1 , from @xmath85 to @xmath86 ( as previously done in section  [ sec : counts ] with discretely - valued @xmath23 ) , and define @xmath36 as the number of los within a particular bin .",
    "we then weight each @xmath0 value by @xmath41 of its respective bin when constructing the pdf .",
    "the variables discussed in section  [ ssec : changingzeta ] are the principal contributors to gravitational lensing ; however , using a single variable may be too basic of an approximation .",
    "we can expand our definition of equation ( [ eq : weights ] ) to allow the weighted sum ( @xmath81 ) to be the product of characteristics @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of variables .",
    "figure [ fig : weightsbar ] ( the seven right - most set of bars ) and table [ wsigs ] show that this leads to greater improvements in @xmath4 when combining @xmath59 with the established @xmath78 , though in principle this can be done with any combination .",
    "in addition to generalizing @xmath81 , we can use equation ( [ eq : wcon ] ) to impose multiple @xmath79 conditions .",
    "for example , we can require that los satisfy equation ( [ eq : wcon ] ) for both galaxy count and @xmath59 weighting .",
    "this is a more stringent demand , as los must now pass two separate cuts . note that our respective @xmath79 ( in this example @xmath15 , @xmath89 ) values need not be equivalent .",
    "however , for the sake of illustration in this paper we will assume they are .",
    "we refer to the number of applied conditions as @xmath90 .",
    "this imposes consecutive cuts that improve the quality of the @xmath0 pdf , but reduce the number of los .",
    "as long as @xmath90 is not chosen to be large enough to introduce statistical uncertainty , we expect a sharpening of the peak as remaining los will be more relevant to the lens of interest .",
    "we must , however , now expand our definition of @xmath36 to incorporate combinations of every possible value between @xmath91 for each of @xmath90 .",
    "thus each los does not simply correspond to one of @xmath42 values , but instead @xmath92 .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath79 refers to the relative overdensity of any of the aforementioned weights ( e.g. galaxy counts , @xmath59 , @xmath64 , @xmath93 , @xmath68 ) . using the prescribed method we measure @xmath4 for each weighting scheme .",
    "we do this by constructing the pdf from los that satisfy equation ( [ eq : wcon ] ) in three variations : ( 1 ) @xmath79 ; ( 2 ) @xmath79 and @xmath15 , and ; ( 3 ) @xmath94 , and @xmath89 .",
    "it is worth noting that for case ( 2 ) this amounts to applying the same condition twice for @xmath15 , and in case ( 3 ) we have a similar redundancy for both @xmath15 and @xmath95 .",
    "we expect that imposing more conditions , as in cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , would lead to a smaller width of the @xmath0 pdf .",
    "figure  [ fig : weightsbar ] shows @xmath4 for these latter two cases .",
    "there are several features here worth noting .",
    "first , changes in @xmath4 for @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are relatively small when compared with those for @xmath98 .",
    "thus , it is most easy to detect any increase or decline in @xmath4 for @xmath98 .",
    "second , if we assume that any change in @xmath4 for each @xmath78 at @xmath98 is indicative of the change at lower @xmath79 ( albeit on a smaller scale ) , then we can restrict the analysis to @xmath98 to determine which variables constrain @xmath0 the most .",
    "we also see that in all cases @xmath4 decreases when more conditions are imposed , as expected .",
    "table  [ wsigs ] gives the values for the bars in figure  [ fig : weightsbar ] , along with @xmath79 for case ( 1 ) as mentioned above .",
    "we note that for lenses with @xmath99 in multiple conditions , the uncertainty in @xmath0 is reduced to @xmath100 , a level that is comparable to or smaller than the strong lens mass modeling uncertainty in terms of its impact on the time - delay distance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as current and future surveys are expected to discover at least hundreds of lenses @xcite , we expect an efficient sample for cosmographic studies to contain lenses with relative overdensities @xmath101 .",
    "this will ensure that uncertainties due to the los structures are subdominant .    [",

    "the slight difference in @xmath15 could be due to ( 1 ) our imposed redshift restriction @xmath110 that was not applied by @xcite , and ( 2 ) the cosmos field being slightly overdense .",
    "however , it is not clear how much cosmos is overdense when the redshift condition is imposed . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect this correction , though in the future this will need to be measured before applying it to time - delay systems for cosmological inferences . in a method analogous to section  [ sec : weights ]",
    "we compute @xmath79 for each characteristic , the results of which can be seen in table  [ btable ] for characteristics that are computed with a higher degree of accuracy ( e.g. , @xmath59 ) .",
    "unfortunately the present data are not sufficient to estimate reliable stellar masses , luminosities , or accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "deeper optical and nir imaging of the field are necessary to obtain more accurate redshifts ( see table  [ zphotsigs ] ) , luminosities , and stellar masses for computing @xmath79 .",
    "next we select from the millennium simulation lines of sight with the new @xmath79 values to find @xmath0 . in keeping with section  [ sec : weights ]",
    "we impose equation ( [ eq : wcon ] ) for both @xmath15 and @xmath79 and find @xmath0 and @xmath4 for the resulting distribution .",
    "these , along with the number of lines of sight , are given in the last three columns of table [ btable ] .",
    "distributions with @xmath111 are closely correlated and therefore have large @xmath36 . in figure",
    "[ fig : b1608pdf ] , we show the @xmath0 pdf for b1608@xmath3656  with ( 1 ) only @xmath112 imposed , and ( 2 ) both @xmath112 and @xmath113 conditions imposed .",
    "the additional @xmath113 condition sharpens the pdf , leading to a decrease in @xmath4 from 0.056 by @xmath114 . in this specific case of b1608@xmath3656 ,",
    "the new @xmath0 pdf does not decrease the uncertainty on the final time - delay distance measurement appreciably since the stellar kinematics of the lens galaxy provides substantial constraints on @xmath0 already , similar to the level that is achieved with the multiple @xmath79 conditions . nonetheless , the pdf of the time - delay distance is shifted to lower values by @xmath115 due to the lower @xmath38 .",
    "we thus conclude that even though these effects are smaller than current uncertainties for a single lens , they will become important for reaching the ultimate goal of 1% precision and accuracy .    to generalize , without the velocity dispersion as a constraint ,",
    "the new @xmath0 would have decreased the uncertainty on the resulting @xmath10 from b1608@xmath3656  for various uniform",
    "cosmological priors by @xmath116 from @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , for lens systems in which the lens velocity dispersion is difficult to obtain ( due to , e.g. , bright lensed images that are near the lens galaxies ) , or for very large samples for which stellar velocity dispersions might not be practical , our techniques for tightening @xmath0 are especially valuable since the reduction in the uncertainty on @xmath0 would then translate directly to that on the time - delay distance ( e.g. , @xmath118 in @xmath0 is approximately 1% on the time - delay distance ) .",
    "with the goal of finding ways to measure the effects of the distribution of mass along the line of sight to gravitational lensing time delays , we have performed a comprehensive analysis of simulated lines of sight catalogs .",
    "these lines of sight catalogs are based on the millennium simulation , used to compute the external convergence @xmath0 via ray - tracing , as well as on semianalytic models of galaxy formation , used to assign observable properties to halos along the line of sight .      1 .",
    "the observed relative abundance of galaxies within a given aperture @xmath15 provides an estimate of @xmath0 that is accurate to a few percent , depending on the actual under / overdensity of the observed line of sight .",
    "this is consistent with previous work @xcite .",
    "2 .   adding information from other observables like stellar mass , luminosity , redshift , position of the galaxies in the vicinity of the main deflector , reduces significantly the uncertainty in @xmath0 . the most significant drop in uncertainty",
    "is obtained by weighting each galaxy with the inverse of the projected distance to the main deflector , followed by powers of the stellar mass . with this kind of information the uncertainty on time - delay distance arising from @xmath0",
    "can be reduced to @xmath119% from @xmath120% using only galaxy counts for a very overdense line of sight and to @xmath121% for typical lines of sight .",
    "even though spectroscopic redshifts are valuable , especially for the galaxies most closely associated with the main deflector , photometry in three optical bands ( e.g. , gri ) and the near infrared ( k ) are sufficient for obtaining photometric redshifts such that the median and width of the @xmath0 change by @xmath122 , i.e. , @xmath123 on the time - delay distance .",
    "4 .   as a practical illustration",
    ", we apply this method to the field of b1608@xmath3656  and show that some gain can be made even with existing data .",
    "better multiband photometry is needed to fully realize the gains promised by our method .    from these results ,",
    "we conclude that with sufficient imaging and spectroscopy data the effects of the mass distribution along the line of sight on gravitational time - delay distances can be accounted for and the associated uncertainties reduced for all lines of sight .",
    "these improvements  in combination with recent advances in the derivation of gravitational time delays @xcite and in the modeling of the mass distribution of the main deflector and objects in close proximity to it @xcite  bring us closer to the goal of 1% precision in cosmological distances , necessary to address fundamental issues such as the nature of dark energy @xcite .    in the next decade",
    ", upcoming surveys are expected to deliver thousands of gravitationally lensed quasars @xcite , a number more than sufficient to meet the 1% goal provided effort is made to keep systematic uncertainties under control .",
    "this will have to include theoretical uncertainties related to the choice of numerical simulations and associated semianalytic models .",
    "our choice of using overdensities with respect to random fields , as opposed to absolute densities , minimizes the impact of the choice of this specific model .",
    "however , as the number of lenses with measured time delays increases thus reducing the observational errors toward the 1% level , it will be important to repeat and extend this study with independent cosmological simulations and galaxy formation models .",
    "this is left for future work .    from an observational point of view",
    ", the future abundance of targets will change dramatically the situation with respect to the present time when the precision of time - delay cosmology is limited by the number of known strongly lensed quasars , and allow us to choose the targets that give more cosmological information at fixed observational resources .",
    "this work suggests that focusing follow - up efforts on specific lines of sight  those that are not too overdense with respect to the average of the universe ",
    "should result in substantial gains in efficiency .",
