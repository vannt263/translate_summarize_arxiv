    "semiconductor quantum dot systems have been studied extensively in recent years .",
    "these quantum dots ( qudots ) typically contain from a few to a few hundreds of extra - electrons and are externally controlled by voltage gates .",
    "their behavior at low bias voltages can be well understood by looking at the energetically topmost electrons in the qudot .",
    "@xcite for an even number of electrons , they may pair up such that the total spin is zero and the topmost two electrons essentially form a singlet , a system that has been proposed as a possible source for entangled electrons .",
    "@xcite however , under special circumstances , the ground state may actually be a triplet even without the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "@xcite a straightforward explanation for this behavior can be given in terms of the exchange contribution to the energy from the two topmost electrons for the case of nearly degenerate single particle levels .",
    "@xcite for an odd total number of electrons on a single qudot , the overall spin is typically found to be @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we consider an ensemble of qudots , specifically a @xmath1 array of interconnected and interacting qudots similar to the typical cellular automata unit cell format .",
    "@xcite the interaction is modelled within a capacitance matrix formalism . in the weak tunneling regime ,",
    "the direct exchange energy from the two - body interaction between electrons on different qudots is negligible .",
    "residence of these two electrons on the same qudot ( double occupancy ) is energetically unfavorable due to the comparatively large coulomb charging energies .",
    "the @xmath1 array is considered as a particular implementation of a charge quantum bit ( charge qubit ) . as shown in [ ] , it is essential for the single qubit operations of such a charge qubit to have a non - local potential , tuneable tunneling amplitudes or an external magnetic field which provides a complex phase to the wavefunction . since the direct exchange contribution with charges on different dots is negligible , there are no non - local potential effects here .",
    "further , the tunneling amplitude is considered constant , fixed by the specific realization of the solid state qudot array which typically uses oxide barriers between qudots , and are then basically unaltered by potential gates . in this context of a fixed geometry ,",
    "the only way to implement full single qubit operations is using an external magnetic field which can be controlled at will .",
    "@xcite it is further considered that the field is uniform within the area of the qudot array as is likely the case in normal implementations .    due to the geometrical symmetry of the qudot array , the ground state turns out to be exactly degenerate for the triplet states when no magnetic field and no gate voltages are applied .",
    "however , the spectrum exhibits a gap for the singlet states which is related to the distinct symmetry under particle exchange for the singlet and triplet states .",
    "therefore , particle exchange does play an essential role , yet it is a higher order effect , similar to superexchange @xcite , as the exchange of two particles on the qudot array takes more than one tunneling step and explores virtual higher energy states .",
    "the properties of the singlet and triplet states are determined by two remaining parameters , the asymmetrically applied gate voltage @xmath2 , which breaks the @xmath3 degree symmetry , and the external magnetic field @xmath4 perpendicular to the array .",
    "we show that careful control of the magnetic flux through the system allows one to rotate the qubit bloch vector about an axis orthogonal to the one provided by @xmath2 .",
    "these two parameters then , provide full quantum manipulation of the charge qubits .",
    "the analysis of our numerical results follows the feshbach formalism ( app .",
    "[ app.feshbach ] ) which provides an effective hamiltonian of the two relevant dimensions of the qubit subspace , well decoupled energetically from higher lying states .",
    "this approach provides insights on the nature of the system dependence on fields , and explains the ability of the magnetic field to complete the set of necessary single qubit operations .",
    "we examined a range of different geometries of planar arrays with capacitively coupled quantum dots .",
    "the best decoupled quantum @xmath5 level systems ( qu2ls ) in the ground state were found to exhibit high spatial symmetry , i.e. @xmath6 symmetry , in agreement with the requirement of spatially distinct wave functions needed to participate in the qu2ls .",
    "@xcite the @xmath6 symmetry of the @xmath1 array , for example , ensures a binary groundstate system that for weak inter - dot tunneling is well decoupled energetically from the remainder of the spectrum .",
    "other geometries are clearly possible , but we have chosen here one of the simplest closed loops with @xmath6 symmetry to demonstrate the main concepts .    the model network under consideration is a @xmath1 array of qudots with a single spatial state per site plus spin . the system is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig_2x2_setup]a .",
    "as explicitly outlined in panel ( b ) , tunneling is allowed between any pair of dots , where every tunnel junction also carries capacitance .",
    "the parameters which enter the model are : the dot - gate capacitance ( @xmath7 ) , the dot - dot capacitances ( @xmath8 for nearest neighbor dots and @xmath9 for dots connected through the diagonal of the array ) , the dot self - capacitance ( @xmath10 ) and the dot - dot tunneling amplitude ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the parameters have been chosen such that the energy cost for double occupancy of a dot ( standard hubbard @xmath12 ) is about @xmath13 , a commonly used value for these systems , and corresponding to typical dot dimensions of @xmath14 .",
    "further , the tunneling @xmath15 must not be chosen too large since otherwise the quality of the @xmath5-level system in the groundstate as well as the well - defined charge per dot are compromised , as we will see below .",
