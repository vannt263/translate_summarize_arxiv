    "the intensity depends strongly on the details of the fit model .",
    "peak - like structures in this region are probably due to imperfections of the applied pwa model . a remarkable change of the shape of the intensity spectrum of the @xmath45 wave with @xmath35 is observed ( see fig .",

    "for the @xmath35 bins in the interval from 0.449 to @xmath49 , the observed intensities exhibit a very different shape as compared to the low-@xmath35 region , with a structure emerging at about 1.6  gev/@xmath47 and the intensity at lower masses disappearing rapidly with increasing @xmath35 .",

    "the intensity distributions of real data and deck monte carlo exhibit strong similarities suggesting that the observed intensity might be saturated by the deck effect .",

    "this leaves room for a potential resonance signal .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the deck pseudo data contain no resonant contributions .",

    "the breit - wigner model describes the peak in the @xmath53 wave well and yields a mass of @xmath56  mev/@xmath47 and a width of @xmath57  mev/@xmath47 for the @xmath6 . due to the high precision of the data ,",

    "the @xmath6 signal is remarkable in many ways .",
