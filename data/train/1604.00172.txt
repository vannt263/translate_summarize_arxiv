    "in dilute media governed by a hard core repulsion and a short range attractive interaction , it is reasonable to assume that correlations are largely exhausted by clusterization@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "cluster models appear extremely successful in quantitatively describing systems as different as simple fluids , atomic and molecular clusters , metallic alloys , nuclear multifragmentation , and neutron star crusts@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of such models is very well known at the thermodynamic limit@xcite , but very few formal studies exist for finite systems , even if these latter are a primary field of application of such models .    in particular , exactly solvable microscopic models have been shown to exhibit thermodynamic anomalies@xcite .",
    "when a first order phase transition exists at the thermodynamical limit , the microcanonical entropy of the corresponding finite system presents a positive convexity , which is forbidden at the thermodynamic limit and leads to a negative heat capacity in the microcanonical ensemble@xcite .",
    "this concept was extended to other statistical ensembles@xcite .",
    "a negative susceptibility should be observed if the order parameter is a conserved quantity , while in the statistical ensemble where the order parameter is fixed by an external field , the phase transition is signalled by bimodal distributions of observables correlated to the order parameter@xcite .    a case of particular interest concerns frustrated systems , because the long range coulombic interaction is known to quench the phase transition of simple fluids@xcite , a phenomenology which is notably at play in the astrophysical context of neutron star crusts@xcite .    concerning cluster models ,",
    "negative susceptibilities have been reported both in the canonical@xcite and in the monte - carlo version of the microcanonical ensemble@xcite if clusters are electrically neutral . in both cases",
    "it was shown that phase transition signals are affected by the presence of the coulomb interaction , and the liquid - gas phase transition is quenched for heavily charged systems . however , in these works the phase diagram of the model was not computed and it is not clear if the fragmentation phenomenon under strong coulomb fields can still be viewed as a manifestation of the liquid - gas phase transition@xcite .    in ref.@xcite , the phase diagram of the finite charged three - dimensional ising model was computed .",
    "it was reported that the introduction of the coulomb interaction leads to a deep modification of the phase diagram , where the liquid - gas phase transition is replaced by a different , coulomb induced , first - order fragmentation transition at lower temperature , similar to the phenomenon of nuclear fission .",
    "based on these findings , it was suggested that the phenomenon of nuclear multifragmentation could be associated to this coulomb - driven transition .",
    "however this connection could only be qualitative , because the classical lattice gas model can not quantitatively describe nuclear data .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see if a similar phenomenology is present in the cluster model , whose predictive power in the description of fragmentation data was clearly proved over the past decades@xcite .",
    "based on these motivations , in this paper we study the phase diagram of the finite cluster model , and its modifications in the presence of the coulomb interaction .    we show that approximations in the calculation of the grandcanonical partition sum prevent to recover the analytical relationships among statistical ensembles which should hold in finite systems . in spite of that , the thermodynamic anomalies which have been reported in the finite system counterpart of first order phase transitions are correctly reproduced by such effective model when neutral clusters are considered . in a finite system density can be varied both by varying the number of particles inside a fixed volume , or varying the volume of the box in which a fixed number of particles is contained . only this latter situation is relevant for the description of the fragmentation phase transition observed in nuclear collisions .",
    "we show in detail that these two physical situations lead to deeply different phase diagrams , though in both cases a liquid - gas phase transition is observed . in the presence of a sufficiently strong coulomb interaction ,",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition is quenched , in agreement with previous studies .",
    "this suggests that the transition might be better observable in nuclear fragmentation of light systems .",
    "however a marginal region of ensemble inequivalence persists at low temperature and high density , related to a transition between a dilute gas phase and a phase of finite size droplets .",
    "interesting enough , a backbending in the @xmath0 equation of state , which is maybe the most intuitive signal proposed for the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition , systematically observed in all mean - field models , is only observed by varying the number of particles in a fixed volume , while in the physical situation relevant for nuclear fragmentation there is no upraising branch at high density .",
    "as we have stated in the introduction , the basic principle of the thermodynamic cluster model is the hypothesis@xcite that in dilute media governed by short range attractive forces , inter - particle interactions essentially lead to the formation of clusters .",
    "the system of interacting particles is thus modelized as an ideal gas of non - interacting clusters .    for simplicity",
    "we assume a simple fluid of stuctureless particles of mass @xmath1 , though cluster models of binary fluids and binary alloys have been developed for different applications@xcite .    assuming that the ground state energy @xmath2 of a cluster of size @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 is known as well as its full spectrum of excited states @xmath5 , the partition sum of an isolated cluster at inverse temperature @xmath6 in a volume @xmath7 reads    @xmath8= \\frac{v}{h^3 } \\left ( \\frac{2\\pi m s}{\\beta } \\right ) ^{3/2 } \\cdot   \\exp\\left [ -\\beta f_\\beta(s ) ) \\right ] , \\label{omegas}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the degeneracy of state @xmath10 , the cluster entropy is given by @xmath11 , and we have made a saddle point approximation , @xmath12 \\approx exp[-\\beta f_\\beta(s ) ] , \\label{saddle}\\ ] ] where the cluster free energy is given by @xmath13 .",
    "an exact calculation of the cluster energy states from the microscopic hamiltonian is out of scope , especially if the constituent particles have to be treated within quantum mechanics , as it is the case for instance for nuclear clusters .",
    "however , mean - field or density functional methods can be employed . in this paper",
    "we will use a standard phenomenological prescription@xcite consisting of a volume and a surface term @xmath14 appropriate for compact clusters in three dimensions . to optimize the predictive power for nuclear clusters , we choose the temperature dependence appropriate for fermion systems : @xmath15 and fix the numerical value of the parameters such as to reproduce nuclear phenomenology : @xmath16 , @xmath17 mev and @xmath18 where @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 .",
    "an important point in the definition of a cluster model concerns the definition of the cluster self - volume .",
    "early applications considered point - like clusters@xcite .",
    "the simplest implementation of a finite self - volume consists in assuming completely incompressible clusters with a radius @xmath21 in three dimensions . within this description ,",
    "the volume appearing in eq.([omegas ] ) has to be reduced from total volume ( @xmath22 ) by the volume occupied by the clusters .",
    "this is readily calculated if the density is homogeneous ( compact clusters ) : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents the volume which would be occupied if all of the @xmath25 particles would make a single cluster . in this paper",
    "we will adopt this description and discuss in detail the important implications that this excluded volume mechanism induces in the grandcanonical thermodynamics .",
    "specifically , we will show that the grandcanonical partition sum can not be analytically calculated for finite systems in the presence of excluded volume .",
    "an interesting extension of the cluster model to compressible clusters can be found in refs .",

    "eq.([fneutral ] ) describes charge neutral clusters .",
    "the introduction of electric charge leads to an inter - fragment interaction which in principle breaks the ideal gas free energy additivity .",
    "it is however very well known that a good approximation of the coulomb energy of a system of uniformly charged spherical clusters is given by the so - called wigner - seitz approximation@xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of clusters of size @xmath3 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the maximum cluster size allowed in the total volume @xmath7 , and we have assumed for simplicity that all clusters are charge symmetric , with an effective charge @xmath30 .",
    "the energies appearing in the second term read : @xmath31 we can see that the exact result for the coulomb energy is recovered in the limit @xmath32 , where it converges to the sum of the clusters coulomb energies , and in the limit @xmath33 , where it gives the energy of a single cluster occupying the whole volume .    the free energy expression ( [ fneutral ] ) with the inclusion of a coulomb energy term in the form ( [ ecoul ] ) was successfully employed in the past in the description of nuclear multifragmentation@xcite . for an application to the inner crust of neutron star and core - collapse supernova",
    "matter@xcite the charge screening from the presence of a uniform electron background has to be accounted for .",
    "this can also be readily implemented in the wigner - seitz approximation@xcite , and gives a free energy functional intermediate between the physical case of neutral and charged clusters . in this paper",
    ", we will limit ourselves to the two extreme cases of neutral and fully charged systems , and will not consider applications requiring electron screening .",
    "the canonical partition function for a system of @xmath25 particles at a given inverse temperature @xmath6 is given by @xmath34 here the sum is over all possible cluster partitions which satisfy the conservation laws , and @xmath35 is the number of the composites of size @xmath3 in the given partition .",
    "the average number of clusters with @xmath3 particles is seen easily from the above equation to be @xmath36 the canonical particle number conservation constraint @xmath37 can be used to obtain a recursion relation for the partition function @xmath38 this recursion relation allows computing all different observables by successive partial derivatives , using standard statistical mechanics expressions .",
    "specifically , the pressure , chemical potential and mean energy are given by : @xmath39 where all the partial derivatives are numerically calculated from finite differences .",
    "now let us turn to the definition of the grandcanonical ensemble .",
    "the standard statistical definition of the grandcanonical partition sum , which in principle should be valid in any model , reads ( we note the fugacity @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the canonical partition sum corresponding to the same volume , the same temperature , and @xmath25 particles . in our model",
    ", we can access all @xmath42 via the recursion relation , provided @xmath43 .",
    "going towards the thermodynamic limit implies @xmath44 , and also @xmath45 .",
    "this means that in principle we can calculate via recursion all @xmath42 whatever is @xmath25 , even if of course increasing @xmath25 will become numerically more and more expensive .",
    "the only unknown is then the vacuum partition sum @xmath46 . as we have discussed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "if we have an alternative expression for @xmath47 we can deduce this unknown from the condition of normalization of probabilities : @xmath48    here we want to work in a finite system and not at the thermodynamical limit .",
    "then @xmath7 is a fixed finite number , and if @xmath49 , @xmath50 because we can not fit the particles in the finite volume .",
    "again , if we have an alternative expression for @xmath47 , we can deduce @xmath46 from the condition of normalization of probabilities ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "it is customary @xcite to utilize this alternative expression for @xmath47 in the ( grand canonical ) canonical thermodynamical model [ ( g)ctm ] using cluster multiplicities . indeed if we replace in eq.([stat ] ) the ctm expression for the canonical partition sum we get @xmath51 which can be rewritten as @xmath52 which is the standard expression of the grandcanonical partition sum @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 ) as given in the literature@xcite .    in this equation ,",
    "@xmath55 . if we consider the thermodynamic limit , everything is coherent and correct .",
    "the canonical and grandcanonical partition sums satisfy the general relation eq.([stat ] ) , the quantity @xmath56 defined by equation ( [ norm ] ) can indeed be interpreted as a probability , and we can plug eq.([zgc ] ) into eq.([norm ] ) in order to get @xmath46 .    expression ( [ zgc ] ) has been very often used in the literature .",
    "its great advantage from the computation viewpoint is that the expression of cluster multiplicities is extremely simple : @xmath57 and all thermodynamic quantities are defined in terms of cluster multiplicities : @xmath58 meaning that the model is fully analytical and no numerical calculation is needed .",
    "a problem however arises if we work out of the thermodynamic limit and @xmath7 is a finite volume where no more than @xmath59 particles can be fitted .",
    "this means that the sums over multiplicities in eqs.([zgc1]),([zgc ] ) should not go up to infinity , but only to a maximum finite multiplicity @xmath60 .",
    "for instance the last sum in eq.([zgc1 ] ) should have only two terms , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , because at most one fragment of that size filling the whole available volume can be found .",
    "eq.([zgc1 ] ) should then be transformed to : @xmath63 but if we introduce upper bounds on these sums we lose the simple expression eq.([zgc ] ) .",
    "this means that in ( g)ctm the grandcanonical model ( [ zgc ] ) fulfils the thermodynamic relation ( [ stat ] ) only in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when applied to a finite system , it should always be seen as an approximation of the canonical model .",
    "in particular it does not correctly describe the equilibrium of a finite system with an external particle bath , which in principle a grandcanonical model is supposed to do .    out of the thermodynamic limit , two situations still exist where the grandcanonical model is correct .",
    "the first situation concerns systems with coulomb and volumes which are big enough such that the statistical weight of partitions with @xmath49 is negligible . in this case",
    "we can safely make the approximation    @xmath64    and we can recover eq.([zgc ] ) .",
    "the second possibility is to consider a model without excluded volume .",
    "if we can pile up an arbitrary number of fragments in the finite volume , we will still have a maximum cluster mass @xmath55 because of the finite volume , but we do not have any more a maximum multiplicity in the calculation of the grandcanonical partition sum , meaning that the upper limit in the sums of ( [ zgc1 ] ) is @xmath65 and ( [ zgc ] ) is again correct . in this case , if we want to calculate the grandcanonical partition sum out of eq.([stat ] ) , we should also calculate the sum up to convergence , because without excluded volume there is no upper limit on the maximum number of particles even in a finite volume .",
    "this is however not a satisfactory solution . indeed from a computation viewpoint , eq.([stat ] ) can not be used because we know that the convergence is very slow@xcite . from the physical point of view ,",
    "excluded volume is important and we can conclude that the grancanonical model eq.([zgc ] ) has to be seen only as an approximation to the grandcanonical thermodynamics , allowing infinite multiplicity of any cluster size even in a finite volume .",
    "in particular , the grandcanonical particle number distribution @xmath66 with @xmath53 given by eq.([zgc ] ) , is not normalized .",
    "still we will employ in the following eq.([zgc ] ) to get an approximate estimation of the grandcanonical partition sum , and fix the relation between @xmath67 and @xmath25 giving the mapping between the grandcanonical and canonical ensemble in the standard@xcite way , that is solving the equation    @xmath68",
    "the neutral system is a simple fluid which should exhibit a liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "the order parameter of this transition is the particle density . at the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "a variation of the particle density is obtained by varying both the volume and the particle number in such a way that their ratio stays finite even when @xmath25 and @xmath7 diverge . in a finite system , a variation of the particle density",
    "can be obtained in two different ways , namely changing the number of particles in a given finite volume , or changing the volume in which a given finite number of particles is considered .",
    "because of the different finite size effects , these different procedures are not expected to be necessarily equivalent .",
    "if we consider the dense phase where a single cluster occupies the whole volume , to have at constant volume the same energetic properties obtained at constant particle number for a system of size @xmath69 , we should consider a volume @xmath24 such that @xmath70 . in this volume ,",
    "a unique partition is possible for any density below @xmath71 , while a huge number of different partitions including bound clusters can be considered for the system of size @xmath69 at the same density obtained with a volume @xmath72 .    in the following",
    "we therefore separately consider the phase diagram of a system composed of a finite number of particles , and of a system of particles contained in a finite box .",
    "[ ht ]   ( see text).,title=\"fig:\",width=604 ]    in the last section we have shown that , for a neutral finite system , the grandcanonical model as defined by the standard expression eq.([zgc ] ) is not consistent . to derive the phase diagram of the model",
    ", we will therefore rely on eq.([stat ] ) which is always correct .",
    "we use the same technique as in ref.@xcite . in the absence of coulomb",
    ", the transition belongs to the liquid - gas universality class with particle number as an order parameter . in this situation , according to the general definitions of phase transitions in finite systems@xcite , at each temperature the transition chemical potential is determined by the condition that the grandcanonical particle number probability presents two peaks of equal height . in the cluster model , due to the hypothesis of incompressible clusters ,",
    "the high density peak is always located at @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "noting @xmath74 the particle number corresponding to the low density peak , the transition chemical potential is then given by the analytical relation @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding grandcanonical particle number distributions are shown for different temperatures and a volume @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the volume of a nucleus containing @xmath78 particles at the normal nuclear density ) arbitrarily chosen such that @xmath79 in the left part of fig.[distri ] .",
    "we can see that for all the considered temperatures the low density phase is peaked at a particle number @xmath80 .",
    "the problem , discussed in the last section , concerning the evaluation of the vacuum partition sum @xmath46 thus does not deform the shape of the distribution and the extraction of @xmath81 , and only affects the normalization . in fig.[distri ] we have arbitrarily fixed the undetermined normalization factor by requiring the peaks height be numerically equal to the temperature . as a consequence ,",
    "the thick line joining the probability maxima in fig.[distri ] represents the phase diagram of the ( g)ctm model in the temperature - particle number plane for our choice of volume .",
    "we can see that a large portion of the phase diagram corresponds to the coexistence region of the liquid - gas phase transition . from the phenomenological point of view , this region is defined by characteristic u - shaped cluster distributions where a huge bound cluster dominates the global energetics , while the supercritical region above the thick line corresponds to exponential distributions dominated by monomers .",
    "it is however important to stress that the u - shaped mass distribution is in no way a proof of coexistence .",
    "u - shaped distributions are systematically found in the inner crust of proto - neutron stars@xcite , and they do not correspond to a first order phase transition , but to a macroscopic phase with local inhomogeneities due to the phenomenon of coulomb frustration .",
    "other counter - examples can be found in @xcite .",
    "the indication of the phase transition comes from the bimodality of the order parameter , as shown in the left part of fig.[distri ] .",
    "an alternative order parameter is the size of the largest cluster .",
    "its behavior with temperature normalized to the total particle number is shown in the right side of fig.[distri ] for the canonical ensemble .",
    "we can see that the largest cluster behaves as a percolating cluster exhausting most of the available mass inside the coexistence region .",
    "this is another typical signal associated to the liquid - gas phase transition . in particular , the ending point of the coexistence zone is precisely evidenced by the sudden drop of @xmath82 , but this signal can only be exploited for relatively large particle numbers or the order of @xmath83 . for smaller systems",
    "finite size effects lead to the well - known rounding of the phase transition .",

    "however this information is consistent with the finding in the right part of the same figure , which was computed in the canonical ensemble .",
    "indeed the phase diagram is representative of the model and not of the specific ensemble .",
    "a proof of this statement comes from the fact that the same phase diagram information can be extracted from the study of the canonical chemical potential@xcite . indeed using the definition of the canonical chemical potential eq.([mucan ] ) and eq.([palpha ] ) we get @xmath84 integrating over n between two arbitrary points @xmath85 gives @xmath86 now let us choose , for the given @xmath87 , the grandcanonical chemical potential @xmath88 that corresponds to a @xmath89 with two peaks of equal height .",

    "this equation of state is represented for the two ensembles in fig.[mu_n ] , in the same thermodynamic conditions as before . as it is well known , while the grancanonical equation of state is monotonous , the canonical one shows an inversed ( decreasing ) behavior which is the typical signal of the phase transition .",

    "( [ maxwell ] ) holds in the numerical calculations of the ( g)ctm is also given in the same figure .",
    "the canonical chemical potential from eq.([mucan ] ) is represented as a function of the particle number at a given volume and for different temperatures , together with the value corresponding to the equal area construction eq.([maxwell ] ) .",

    "the consistency of the phase diagram of the cluster model calculated from different statistical ensembles was not verified before to our knowledge .",
    "the effect of the volume on the phase diagram is explored in the right part of fig.[mu_n ] .",
    "we can see that the qualitative behavior of the phase diagram is independent of the volume . at a given temperature ,",
    "decreasing the volume has only a very small effect on the density width of the coexistence zone @xmath93 , but leads to an increase of the transition chemical potential .",
    "this result is consistent with the liquid - gas transition phenomenology of simple fluids , while the small sensitivity of the density transition point with the volume might be attributed to our simplifying hypothesis of incompressible clusters .",

    "+ in previous works@xcite , the possibility of introducing a maximum cluster size @xmath29 in the grandcanonical ensemble was discussed . in these works , it was already shown that the thermodynamic properties of the model strongly depend on the choice of this parameter . the effect on the chemical potential of modifying the maximum cluster size in the grandcanonical ensemble",
    "is shown in the left part of fig.[mu_kmax ] for a representative value of volume and temperature .",
    "we can see that indeed the transition chemical potential wildly changes by modifying @xmath29 .",
    "this is easy to understand , because a partition containing a single cluster of size @xmath29 is the best finite system approximation of the dense liquid phase .",

    "this situation can be physically relevant for metallic nanoparticles in rigid structures@xcite . in the case of fragmentation of atomic nuclei or atomic clusters ,",

    "still , they show an approximate gaussian behavior as it is seen in the uncharged system above the thermodynamical critical point , with a width increasing with the temperature following the thermodynamical relation which relates the susceptibility @xmath111 to the particle number fluctuation @xmath112 : @xmath113 .",
    "this quenching of the phase transition , with a reduction of the critical temperature , is expected due to the repulsive character of the coulomb interaction .",
    "+ however the effect of coulomb is much more drastic than a simple shift of the phase diagram , as shown in the left part of fig.[distri_coul ] .",
    "the purely bimodal behavior of the distribution is not recovered at any temperature , and is replaced by a complex structure showing different peaks with approximately equal spacing . as it was already observed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "these peaks indicate preferential fragmentation structures corresponding to higher multiplicity of clusters of similar size .",
    "+ still , up to around @xmath114 , a transition chemical potential @xmath115 can be defined such that the probability associated to the vapor ( @xmath116 ) is equal to the probability associated to the droplet ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "this can be easily understood from the fact that , due to coulomb , the liquid phase apparent in fig.[distri ] is replaced by a phase constituted of clusters .",
    "+    [ ht ]     the model with coulomb does not admit a thermodynamical limit , therefore it is not possible to study the behavior for @xmath25 or @xmath44 .",
    "however it is easy to verify that an increase of the total volume does not change the structure of the two phases , but simply leads to a displacement of the second peak towards higher particle numbers , corresponding to a higher number of clusters in the dense phase .",
    "+ because of this persistence of phase transition signals in the presence of coulomb , we can expect inequivalence signals to arise in the different equations of state , similar to the neutral case studied in the previous chapter .",
    "this is confirmed by fig.[p_mu_coul ] , which displays the behavior of chemical potential and pressure in the same thermodynamic conditions explored for the neutral system .",
    "we can appreciate the considerable quenching of the phase transition at high temperature .",
    "still , a region of ensemble inequivalence and inversed slope for the canonical equations of state persists at low temperature and high density , reminiscent of the liquid - gas phenomenology enlighten above .",
    "+ in order to show that we are still facing a coexistence phenomenon between a vapor of monomers and ( charged ) droplets , we show in fig.[big_coul ] the distributions of the heaviest cluster@xcite associated to each fragmented configuration in the ensemble inequivalence region .",
    "we can see that the grandcanonical distribution , even when very high particle numbers are implied , is always characterized by two peaks , corresponding to the monomer solution and the droplet solution .",
    "the mass of the largest cluster in the denser phase obviously depends on the available volume , but is always upper limited because of the repulsive coulomb force .",
    "+    [ ht ]   and three different volumes @xmath118 ( black ) , @xmath119 ( red ) and @xmath120 ( green ) are considered .",
    "right part : two different ( average in the gc case ) number of particles @xmath96 ( red ) and @xmath83 ( blue ) are considered and the volume is fixed such that @xmath121 .",
    "calculations are done at a fixed temperature @xmath122 mev.,title=\"fig:\",width=604 ]    the interesting point of this figure is that the low @xmath123 peak is always located at @xmath124 , that is it corresponds to much lower density than the high @xmath123 peak .",
    "density can therefore be viewed as the order parameter of the transition even in the presence of coulomb .",
    "this original result means that , in the framework of this model , fragmentation can still be viewed as a liquid - gas type phase transition even in the presence of coulomb .",
    "when the mass conservation constraint is implemented at the same time as the volume conservation constraint ( canonical ensemble ) the vapor solution becomes inaccessible because a much higher volume would be needed in order to reach its low density . as a consequence , a complex distribution with two peaks corresponding to different heaviest cluster sizes",
    "are observed , as we have already pointed out in our previous work@xcite .",
    "we can however observe that , increasing the particle number such that the conservation constraint becomes less strict ( right part of fig.[big_coul ] ) , the distribution becomes single - peaked again , corresponding to fragmentation configurations where multiple droplets of the biggest size permitted by coulomb are formed .",
    "+ we can therefore conclude that the presence of a peak at @xmath125 in the canonical fragmentation of the small system ( left part of fig.[big_coul ] ) is , at least in this model and in the framework of the wigner - seitz approximation , an effect of particle number conservation , and not the manifestation of a new fission - like phase transition . from the nuclear physics point of view",
    ", these findings imply that the bimodality signal appears as a robust signal of the phase transition in nuclear fragmentation .",
    "in this paper we have studied the phase diagram of the thermodynamical cluster model in the presence of finite size and coulomb effects .",
    "we have shown that , even for arbitrarily small particle numbers , a phase coexistence region can be clearly identified by the behavior of the grandcanonical particle number distribution .",
    "the different phase transition signals proposed in the literature ( backbendings and bimodality of the heaviest cluster distribution ) are consistently found in this coexistence region . depending on the statistical ensemble ,",
    "the behavior of the equations of state and the definition itself of the different phases can be very different . to give a single example , no back - bending",
    "is observed in the @xmath126 relation at low temperature if @xmath7 is fixed , while a clear back - bending is visible in @xmath127 for fixed @xmath25 . in both cases however , a transition chemical potential and pressure can be clearly be defined by the associated grandcanonical distributions .",
    "because of this complexity , the clearest signals of phase transition are given by the simple fact that qualitative differences in the observables are obtained using different statistical ensembles .",
    "this ensemble inequivalence as a signature of phase transition persists even in the presence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "in particular , an equal probability is observed in the grandcanonical ensemble between a vapor and a condensed solution .",
    "this condensed solution is given by a phase characterized by a number of the heaviest clusters that coulomb can sustain , the number of clusters being essentially determined by the available total particle number and/or volume . +",
    "this discussion on the implications of the phase transition in the different ensembles is a somewhat academic discussion for the physical situations which can be experimentally accessible .",
    "some examples exist in low - dimensional condensed matter physics@xcite where it is possible to produce finite systems in different statistical ensembles , and it would be very interesting to apply these consideration to the physics of nanowires .",
    "however , concerning nuclear physics for which the cluster model was originally developed , the statistical ensemble can hardly be varied . specifically , in the standard canonical ensemble which is believed to be the most appropriate to describe the experimentally accessible situation of nuclear fragmentation , the conservation law on both the total particle number and total volume prevents from observing this bimodal behavior , but a ( strongly deformed ) bimodality signal persists in the distribution of the heaviest cluster , as it was reported previously@xcite even if baryon number is exactly conserved , different traditional models of nuclear physics violate this conservation law .",
    "this is especially true in the case of pairing , where particle number conservation , violated by the bcs theory , is typically accounted for by ( approximate ) projection methods . in view of our results",
    ", it would be very interesting to study the finite size effects with the methods introduced in this paper , in the superfluid - normal fluid phase transition . + an other interesting prolongation of the present work concerns the case of stellar matter , which constitutes an intermediate case between the charged and uncharged case .",
    "finite temperature matter formed in core - collapse supernova and in the crust of proto - neutron stars is in equilibrium with respect to strong interactions .",
    "its density is not fixed by a conservation law but imposed by the external gravitational pressure .",
    "this means that , at variance with the laboratory situation , the grandcanonical ensemble is the appropriate ensemble for a statistical description of dense matter .",
    "however , most theoretical modelizations are performed in the canonical ensemble constituted by a finite wigner - seitz cell .",
    "if the ensemble inequivalence we have observed is kept in the case of stellar matter , this could have interesting consequences on the composition of the crust of neutron stars at finite temperature .",
    "this perspective is left for future work .",
