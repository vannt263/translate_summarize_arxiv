    "the remarkable miniaturization of conventional microelectronic devices has been witnessed over the last decades .",
    "if the miniaturization trend is to continue , elements of microelectronic circuits , e.g. transistors and contacts , will soon shrink to single molecules or even atoms . in the past few years",
    ", there have been considerable advances towards fabrications and experimental studies of mono - molecular electronic devices @xcite .",
    "this activity has been largely spurred on by development of experimental techniques to form atomic scale electrical contacts such as scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite and mechanically controllable break junctions @xcite .",
    "measurements of current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics have been recently performed on a single benzene-1,4-dithiolate molecule @xcite , buckminsterfullerene @xcite , individual atoms @xcite , nanoclusters @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite . these initial observations of conduction in molecules were followed quickly by experimental demonstration of the simplest devices : molecular diodes @xcite , switches @xcite and memory elements @xcite although molecular equivalent of a transistor is yet to be discovered .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been recently developed to describe electronic conductivity of molecules @xcite .",
    "one of the widely used methods is based on the combination of extended hckel model or density functional theory to treat the molecular electronic structure , an electronic reservoir model for the contacts and linear response approximation to compute the electronic current as a function of the applied voltage @xcite .",
    "the most recent applications used lippmann - schwinger or non - equilibrium green s functions formalisms plus `` jellium '' model for the contacts and for the molecular - contact interactions @xcite . in all these approaches ,",
    "the system is partitioned into three parts : molecular wire and two electron reservoirs to represent metallic contacts .",
    "the use of the model dependent reservoir - molecule interaction as one of the most pivotal ingredient diminishes the ability of these methods and prevents from a development of predictive and quantitative techniques for the electronic transport problem .",
    "recent density functional theory based calculation demonstrates that a molecular wire is bonded to a gold contact by the thiol bridge which is known to be the strong covalent interaction @xcite .",
    "the empirically treated coupling between metal contacts and the molecular wire , which serves as the interaction for the linear response calculations and represents the kernel of the corresponding lippmann - schwinger equation , is at least strong as intermolecular interaction .",
    "recent papers also indicate the exact nature of the molecule - contact bonding is critical in predicting the correct order of magnitude for the current with applied bias @xcite .",
    "the miniaturization shrinks the size of the system to a level when the problem can be addressed by ab initio electronic structure methods .",
    "as an example consider a standard prototype molecular device system with a single benzene-1,4-dithiolate molecule covalently bonded to two gold electrodes @xcite .",
    "the problem can be reduced to the system where the molecule is bonded to two small au clusters @xcite .",
    "a gold cluster with reasonably small edge influence on the molecular - surface bonding contains 10 atoms @xcite . with a single benzene-1,4-dithiolate molecule as the molecular wire the contact - wire - contact system consists of just 32 atoms .",
    "systems of such size can be routinely simulated by standard quantum chemistry codes .",
    "the main obstacle for the application of the first principle electronic structure methods is not the size of the system but modeling of the electronic current and interpretation of the applied voltage .",
    "suppose that we have solved hartree - fock or kohn - sham equations for a molecular device .",
    "the ground state wave function is real in absence of a magnetic field and therefore the current density computed from this wave function is zero everywhere in the sample .",
    "another important issue is an interpretation of the applied voltage .",
    "virtually all present theoretical approaches are pivotally relied on simplified , noninteracting electrons type models for the metal contacts where the external voltage bias can be straightforwardly associated with the fermi energies shift between left and right electronic baths .",
    "one of the reasons for use electronic reservoir models to represent the metallic contacts is principle theoretical difficulties related to a rigorous quantum mechanical definition of the applied voltage .    in this paper",
    ", we advocate an alternative approach where the use of the electronic reservoir to model contacts is completely avoided from the very beginning and a quantum system with current is treated effectively as a _ closed _ system .",
    "we begin by describing the variational principle for a quantum system with current .",
    "we then derive the schrdinger equation with probability flux which provides exact wavefunctions on the manifold of a given current density .",
    "we next specify two - terminal molecular device steady current subsidiary condition and develop the schrdinger equation for a two - terminal molecular device .",
    "we discuss the use of the energy ballance condition to compute current - voltage characteristics of quantum systems .",
    "we then derive the landauer formula for non - interacting charge carriers within the formalism .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the salient features of the approach through the numerical solution of the self - consistent schrodinger equation for one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with constrained current .",
    "we start with the nonrelativistic hamiltonian for a particle in the external scalar potential @xmath0 ( atomic units are used throughout the paper unless otherwise mentioned ) : @xmath1 we define density and paramagnetic current density as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is not generally an eigenvector of the hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "we will specify an eigenproblem for the @xmath3 in the next section .",
    "the physical current is equivalent to the paramagnetic current densities in absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "an eigenvector for a bound state of a real hamiltonian can be always made real by a change of the phase of the wave function .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath4 is real therefore if we just solve standard schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath4 , we will obtain real wave function @xmath3 and the current density @xmath5 will be automatically zero . the standard way to get a complex wavefunction out of a real hamiltonian is to assume certain boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions could be an assumption of an incoming plane wave in scattering theory or periodic boundary conditions for a translationally invariant system . to solve a scattering problem for a molecular device",
    "is possible only at the cost of major unphysical approximations , e.g. via considering the molecular device as a singe scattering center .",
    "another approach is to assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions prevent one from studying any situations where the change of chemical potential across the system is of finite magnitude because the chemical potential must be also periodic in space .",
    "the local chemical potential is the decreasing function in the direction of the current and therefore the system can not be treated as translationally invariant at least along the current axis .",
    "we have developed an alternative approach where a current carrying quantum system is treated effectively as a _ closed _ system with a subsidiary condition for the generally discontinuous current density distribution .",
    "we start our derivation with the assumption that current carrying states of an open quantum system can be described in terms of wave functions of an effectively closed quantum system if the current is maintained via explicit constraint .",
    "this assumption is a simplified , particular case of the standard assumption in statistical mechanics : a system coupled to a thermal bath can be described with statistical ensembles of a closed system in which the system - bath interaction is not explicitely considered , but enters only via lagrange multipliers and subsidiary constraints .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated that a steady current open mesoscopic system can be described in terms of an ensemble of carrier states in the closed mesoscopic device itself if the steady current is additionally constrained @xcite .",
    "we require that the current density is constrained to be specified function @xmath6 .",
    "it results in the subsidiary constraint equation : @xmath7 the expression ( [ constraint ] ) generally can not be obtained by differentiating of a functional of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "it means that the constraint eq.([constraint ] ) is nonholonomic @xcite .",
    "the variational problem is to minimize the total energy with respect to @xmath8 subject to the nonholonomic constraint for the current density ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "two types of treatment are possible : we can either choose @xmath3 in which the constraint is implicit or we can impose the constraint explicitely by using the lagrange multiplier .",
    "we will follow the second approach which was recently suggested by kosov and greer @xcite , elimination the part of the wavefunction by imposing the explicit constraint . although the constraint formulated as eq.([constraint ] )",
    "is vector and nonholonomic it can be included into a variational functional via pointwise , vector lagrange multipliers @xmath11 @xcite .    within the lagrange multiplier",
    "approach the constraint is explicitly achieved via introduction of the auxiliary functional : @xmath12=   \\langle \\psi |h|\\psi \\rangle -   e \\left ( \\langle \\psi",
    "|\\psi \\rangle   -1\\right ) -   \\int { \\bf a } ( { \\bf r } ) \\cdot \\left({\\bf j}({\\bf r})-   { \\bf i}({\\bf r})\\right ) d{\\bf r }   \\ ; . \\label{omega}\\ ] ] the first two terms are standard in the variational derivation of the schrdinger equation with the first giving the total energy and the second is introduced to maintain the normalization of the wave function . the third term with the vector lagrange multipliers @xmath11 has been introduced to impose the subsidiary constraint for the current density .",
    "a use of the variational principle can be justified only for closed quantum systems .",
    "the choice of @xmath6 can not be obviously completely arbitrary to maintain the closed system boundary condition .",
    "the localized in space quantum system will be considered closed if , first , there are no in- and out- probability flows in the system ; and , second , if the wave function @xmath8 is an eigenvector of a hermitian operator ( it prevents the complex eigenenergies and therefore effectively closes the system ) .",
    "we will demonstrate in the next section that both these conditions are satisfied within our approach .",
    "the minimization of the total energy subject to the subsidiary constraint for the current density ( [ constraint ] ) , i.e the variation of the auxiliary functional @xmath13 $ ] , results into the following non - linear schrdinger equation : @xmath14_+ \\right ) \\psi({\\bf r})=   e \\psi ( { \\bf r } ) \\ ; . \\label{schr1}\\ ] ] the anti - commutator term , @xmath15_+ =   \\frac{1}{2i}\\left(\\nabla   { \\bf a}({\\bf r } )   + 2{\\bf a}({\\bf r } )   \\nabla \\right),\\ ] ] is the additional completely imaginary potential arising directly from the constraint on the current density ( consult with appendix a for the corresponding functional derivatives ) .",
    "this additional constraint potential forces the wave function @xmath16 to be irremovably complex and insures that @xmath3 produces the required current density @xmath6 .",
    "a physical interpretation of the lagrange multiplier @xmath17 can be made more explicit if we re - write eq.([schr1 ] ) in the following form : @xmath18 \\psi({\\bf r})=   e \\psi ( { \\bf r } ) \\ ; . \\label{schr2}\\ ] ] it can be now established that the current constraint has introduced the terms which are mathematically equivalent to an external vector potential .",
    "but unlike an external vector potential , the lagrange multiplier @xmath11 does depend upon the wave function @xmath3 and eq.([schr2 ] ) becomes nonlinear and must be solved self - consistently .",
    "the eigenvalue problem eq.([schr2 ] ) is generated by hermitian operator since the lagrange multiplier @xmath11 is real .",
    "being a solution of the hermitian eigenproblem the eigenenergy @xmath19 is real and the wavefunctions @xmath8 form a complete set in hilbert space . within our approach",
    "we deal with the localized in space system with the wave functions generated by the hermitian eigenproblem ( [ schr2 ] ) .",
    "such system is by definition closed and therefore the use of the variational principle is formally justified .",
    "the schrdinger equation with current ( [ schr2 ] ) is not yet in a form allowing for a solution to be found as the lagrange multiplier @xmath11 is not known yet .",
    "we next seek a solution for the lagrangian multiplier @xmath20 .",
    "in the developing of this method we have found out that the most significant source of numerical instabilities in the solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ schr2 ] ) arises from the determination of the lagrange multiplier @xmath11 .",
    "the described below procedure obtaining of the lagrange multiplier has been found to be the most robust .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ schr1 ] ) from the left on the @xmath21 and subtracting from the obtained equation its own hermitian conjugate , yields @xmath22 equation ( [ lagrange1 ] ) can be resolved for @xmath11 with the assumption that both the density @xmath23 and the current density @xmath5 decay to zero at infinity . in this case",
    "the direct integration of eq.([lagrange1 ] ) results into the following expression for the lagrange multiplier @xmath11 : @xmath24 substitution of the constraint for the current density eq.([constraint ] ) into eq.([lagrange2 ] ) yields the simple expression in which the lagrange multiplier depends upon the wave function only via the density in the denominator : @xmath25    there is a direct similarity between equation for the lagrange multiplier ( [ lagrange2 ] ) and the definition of the velocity of a quantum trajectory within de broglie - bohm causal description of quantum mechanics @xcite . within the de broglie - bohm dynamics",
    "the velocity @xmath26 of a trajectory at a given point is computed as @xcite : @xmath27 therefore , at least for stationary systems the vector lagrange multiplier @xmath20 can be directly related to the velocity for a corresponding de broglie - bohm trajectory . by this analogy",
    "we can make the physical interpretation of the lagrange multiplier more explicit . in the de broglie - bohm quantum dynamics to maintain the constant flux at the given density profile one needs to adjust the local trajectory velocities .",
    "the vector lagrange multiplier appears to play the simular role in the schrodinger equation with constrained current .",
    "likewise for a point with the non - zero trajectory velocity , the current density has finite value at a point with the non - zero vector lagrange multiplier . and",
    "likewise the de broglie - bohm velocity , a product of the vector lagrange multiplier on the probability density yields the current density .    with this choice of the lagrange multiplier ( [ lagrange3 ] )",
    "we obtain the schrdinger equation with the current @xmath28 in the self - consistent and closed form : @xmath29 \\psi({\\bf r})=   e \\psi ( { \\bf r } ) \\ ; .",
    "\\label{schr3}\\ ] ] the derivation of the self - consistent schrdinger equation eq.([schr3 ] ) composes one of the central results of the paper .",
    "the desire to develop the basic schrdinger equation for calculations of @xmath30 characteristics of two terminal molecular devices is the impetus for the present study . to achieve this aim ,",
    "we specify the molecular wire constraint on the current density : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the steady current through the molecular device .",
    "the step function , @xmath33 equals to 1 if @xmath34 and zero otherwise .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the left and right boundaries for the molecular device . within this description ,",
    "net current flow is aligned along the @xmath37axis and there are no in- and out flow : the current starts at the left boundary l and completely absorbed at the right r. with this constraint it is not required to fix the full vector @xmath5 everywhere in the sample . only the net current flow across a cross section @xmath38 is constrained , and this quantity is readily available experimentally .",
    "this is a simple geometric arrangement to specify current flow for the two terminal molecular device and can be extended to more complex device topologies , e.g. for the three terminal devices where three tips are connected to a single molecule @xcite .    likewise ,",
    "as for the derivation of the exact schrdinger equation in the preceding section , with this choice of the constraint ( [ constraint_wire ] ) the minimization of the auxiliary functional ( [ omega ] ) now yields the schrdinger equation for the steady current two terminal molecular device : @xmath39_+",

    "must now be associated with current - voltage characteristics available experimentally .",
    "the rigorous definition of the applied voltage is a controversial issue if one does not invoke to noninteracting electron reservoirs to represent contacts .",
    "we propose the following macroscopic definition of the applied voltage which has the direct relation with the quantities measured experimentally .",
    "the energy increase from the applied voltage @xmath51 is computed by the numerical integration with an assumption of linear voltage drop between the left and right boundaries : @xmath52 we compute the energy of the non - active , i.e. with zero current , molecular device and compute the total energy of the same molecular device at an experimentally given current @xmath32 . then the energy increase for the establishment of the current carrying state , i.e. the energy difference @xmath53 is calculated .",
    "because of the energy ballance condition the @xmath54 must be equal to the @xmath55 and it results into the following equation for the applied voltage bias : @xmath56 the eigenenergy @xmath19 of the schrdinger equation ( [ schrwire2 ] ) should not be confused with the energy of molecular device .",

    "since the wavefunction @xmath3 is complex and the integration ( [ edevice ] ) is not performed over whole space , it is not obvious from the expression ( [ edevice ] ) that the device energy @xmath58 must be real .",
    "we will show now that the device energy @xmath58 is real if the wavefunction @xmath59 produces the constrained current density ( [ constraint_wire ] ) . to prove this we subtract from eq.([edevice ] ) its own complex conjugate and after a bit of algebra arrive to the following expression : @xmath60 the length of the quantum wire",

    "there is no current flow out of the region in any of the @xmath62 or @xmath63 faces .",

    "in order to establish connection with standard approaches and test the method we derive the landauer formula @xcite using the schrdinger equation for current carrying states eq.([schr3 ] ) as the starting point .",

    "for the small voltage and temperature transmissions of electrons take place only through the states in close vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "there are two vectors k , one is positive and one is negative , which correspond to the fermi energy : @xmath69 following the landauer approach we associate the voltage drop ( at the zero temperature ) with the gap between the singe - electron energies of the electrons moving in the direction of the current ( @xmath70 ) and electrons moving in the opposite direction ( @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 substituting the expressions for the @xmath73 and @xmath74 eqs.([k+],[k- ] ) into the landauer s definition of the applied voltage ( [ voltage1 ] ) , we readily find @xmath75 with the conductance @xmath76 then , the use of the standard relation between the fermi momentum @xmath77 and the electronic density @xmath78 along with the small current expansion of the square root eq.([conductivity1 ] ) results into the landauer formula for a single transport channel of an ideal one - dimensional lead @xcite : @xmath79 if we take into account the spin degeneracy of real electrons , the conductance becomes multiplied by 2 . by accounting the degeneracy and converting the conductance eq.([landauer2 ] ) to si units the standard value @xmath80 is obtained .",
    "re - deriving the standard result we demonstrate that in the low current and zero temperature limits our method is equivalent to the traditional approaches which are based on the landauer formula .",
    "we demonstrate applications of the method with numerical examples .",
    "the numerical solution of a self - consistent schrdinger equation is often performed within a finite basis set expansion for the wave function with subsequent diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix until the self consistency is reached .",
    "we have found out that it is computational convenient to form the complete , real basis set from the solutions of the zero - current schrdinger equation : @xmath81 then we expand the wave function of a current currying state on this basis @xmath82 the coefficients @xmath83 must be complex for the wave function which produces a non - zero current . with the expansion ( [ expansion ] )",

    "we solve the self - consistent schrdinger equation for the step function constraint as a primary example : @xmath92 the external potential was taken in the harmonic oscillator form and we put @xmath93 and @xmath94 as left and right boundaries for the current carrying part of the system in all our calculations .",

    "the imaginary part becomes zero when the real component reaches its maximum , i.e. at the point @xmath104 .",
    "although the total wave function is real at the point @xmath104 the current is not vanished because the derivative of the wave function remains complex .",
