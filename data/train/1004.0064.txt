    "the development of microchips for trapping and manipulating ultracold atoms has progressed rapidly in the last decade  @xcite . with lithography and other processes ,",
    "complex surface structures can be fabricated to provide various tight trapping potentials for cold atoms in the proximity of the microchip surface .",
    "however , the fluctuating electromagnetic fields emanating from metallic surfaces may lead to loss and decoherence of trapped atoms , thus limiting the performance of the atom chip  @xcite in devices such as atom interferometers and atomic clocks .",
    "superconducting atom chips have been shown to reduce both the near field noise and technical noise  @xcite .",
    "the spin - flip lifetime and coherence of the trapped atoms improves accordingly .",
    "additionally , superconducting atom chips may provide a platform to realize a coherent interface between atomic or molecular quantum states and quantum solid - state devices  @xcite .",
    "a special property of type - ii superconductors in the mixed state is the presence of vortices .",
    "the effect of vortices on the trapping potentials generated by current - carrying superconducting structures in the mixed state has been studied  @xcite .",
    "recently , stable magnetic traps without applied transport current that use the fields produced by vortices trapped in a superconducting strip  @xcite or disk  @xcite have been experimentally demonstrated .",
    "this suggests that vortices could provide a bridge between coherent atomic states and solid - state quantum devices , enabling novel applications and interesting new fundamental studies .",
    "the properties of these vortex - based traps depend directly on the vortex distribution .",
    "this also implies that sufficiently cold atoms could be used as a sensitive probe of the distribution and dynamics of vortices in superconductors  @xcite .    in this paper , we describe in detail how to design magnetic traps for low - field seeking atoms using vortex penetration in a type - ii superconducting thin film .",
    "we show how to create various trap types such as a single harmonic type trap , a double trap , or traps without the typically applied bias field , and we include experimental characterizations related to our theoretical findings .",
    "these traps form at distances large compared to the characteristic vortex - vortex spacing , so it is useful to model the vortex field with the bean critical - state approximation @xcite .",
    "this approach replaces the individual vortices in a mixed state ( shubnikov state ) superconductor with an equivalent current density in a finite - width thin strip , which accurately describes our setup geometry .",
    "the mesoscopic equivalent supercurrent can be induced either by an external magnetic field pulse perpendicular to the surface or by a transport current pulse through the superconductor ; we study both cases .",
    "straightforward application of the biot - savart law then yields the potential relevant for an atom with a magnetic moment that is in the vicinity of the microchip .",
    "this computation has enabled the discovery and optimization of several vortex - based trap geometries that we have subsequently observed in experiments  @xcite : a micro - trap resembling the z - type wire - trap geometry , a double trap , and a self - sufficient trap requiring no external bias field .",
    "while analogous potentials have been demonstrated using normally - conducting wires , we expect that in our superconducting atom chip ( during the atom - trapping phase ) , the near - field noise is significantly reduced and technical noise decreases as the transport current is absent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : flux ] contains a brief summary of magnetic flux penetration in type - ii superconductors . in sec .",
    "[ sec : b ] we study the mesoscopic equivalent supercurrents induced by a pulsed external field perpendicular to the strip surface . the induced supercurrent distribution is computed along with the resulting external magnetic field , which is the basis for the magnetic traps . in sec .",

    "we briefly review magnetic flux penetration in the form of quantized vortices , in order to introduce the physics background relevant to the simulations presented in the following sections .",
    "vortex penetration exists for only type - ii ( as opposed to type - i ) superconductors .",
    "the order parameter of a superconductor is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the london penetration depth and @xmath2 is the coherence length .",
    "type - i superconductors have @xmath3 and their transition from the superconducting phase to the normal conducting state occurs for external magnetic fields @xmath4 higher than the thermodynamic critical field @xmath5 , where @xmath6 tm@xmath7 is the quantum of magnetic flux . for an applied field",
    "@xmath8 , the superconductor is in the meissner state and flux penetrates only into a thin surface layer of depth @xmath1 . in this layer",
    ", the shielding currents can reach the critical current density @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , type - ii superconductors have @xmath10 and are characterised by two critical magnetic fields : @xmath11 below which the superconductor is in the meissner state , and @xmath12 above which the superconductor is in the normal conducting state . in the field range @xmath13 ,",
    "the superconductor is said to be in the mixed ( or shubnikov ) state and magnetic flux penetrates in the form of vortices .",
    "each single vortex carries a quantum of magnetic flux and consists of a normal core of radius @xmath14 around which shielding currents flow within a radius @xmath15  @xcite .    in an ideal type - ii superconductor without defects or fluctuations , vortices enter the sample from the edges and arrange themselves in a triangular lattice ( abrikosov lattice ) .",
    "the distance between vortices decreases when @xmath16 and @xmath17 increase . shielding currents with density @xmath18 flow in the penetrated region and are no longer restricted to a thin surface layer of thickness @xmath19 , but can also flow in the interior of the sample . for temperatures close to @xmath20",
    ", the magnetic flux penetrates uniformly into the sample and can be described by means of a mesoscopic equivalent supercurrent as in the critical - state models  @xcite . at temperatures below an activation temperature @xmath21 , the flux penetration happens via dendritic avalanches that propagate into the sample from the edge  @xcite .",
    "however , the study presented in this paper assumes that the superconductor temperature is close to @xmath20 , so magnetic flux penetration is accurately described by the models given in  @xcite .",
    "actual ( non - ideal ) type - ii superconductors have defects that act as pinning centers where vortices are more likely to form .",
    "the pinning energy competes with the mutual repulsion of the vortices , so an energetically unfavorable arrangement of vortices will change because of thermal fluctuations .",
    "thermal fluctuations may lead to the depinning of single vortices by providing the flux line enough energy to leave the pinning center . during the application of an external magnetic field",
    ", an equilibrium between the pinning energy and the vortex - vortex repulsion is reached , and the resulting vortex distribution may resemble a glass phase without long - range spatial order . after the magnetic field is removed , a new equilibrium configuration must be reached .",
    "the vortices remaining in the sample produce the remanent magnetization and the superconductor is said to be in the remanent state .",
    "the vortex configuration in the remanent state can be subsequently modified by applying a transport current .",
    "the transport current passes through the vortices and a lorentz force arises between the electric current and magnetic flux lines . as a consequence",
    ", some vortices may leave the superconductor or accumulate asymetrically with respect to their initial equilibrium configuration  @xcite .    in previous experimental investigations  @xcite",
    ", we measured the location of the vortex - based magnetic atom trap to be stable over @xmath22 hours .",
    "this confirms that any thermal relaxation of the vortices does not affect the overall macroscopic magnetization of the superconductor on the experiment timescale .",

    "the average magnetic field of the vortices can be accounted for by computing the magnetic field generated by the equivalent mesoscopic supercurrents in the strip . in the following sections we study the vortex field only through the supercurrent distribution . due to the memory effect of the superconductor ,",
