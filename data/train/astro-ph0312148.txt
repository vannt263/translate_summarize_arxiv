    "3c  273 was the first object positively identified as a quasar , in 1963 : the radio source was identified with a magnitude 13 , star - like object by hazard , mackey & shimmins ( 1963 ) and the redshift measured by schmidt ( 1963 ) to be z  =  0.158 .",
    "3c  273 was later found to be a x - ray source , by bowyer ( 1970 ) and kellogg ( 1971 ) , and has been observed with x - ray instruments ever since .",
    "it is a radio - loud quasar , with a jet showing superluminal motion .",
    "although many more quasars have been discovered since the 1960s , 3c  273 remains one of our nearest neighbours ; this , therefore , makes it a prime object to study , over the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum ; see courvoisier ( 1998 ) and references therein .",
    "previous x - ray observations found the high - energy continuum could be fitted by a hard power - law , with a variable photon index , @xmath2  @xmath0  1.31.6 ( turner 1990 ; turner 1991 ; williams 1992 ) . observations by _ exosat _ ( turner 1985 ) first indicated the existence of a soft excess , at energies @xmath3  1  kev ; this was subsequently confirmed by further _",
    "exosat _ observations ( courvoisier 1987 ; turner 1990 ) , together with data from _ einstein _ ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ; turner 1991 ) , _ ginga _ ( turner 1990 ) and _ rosat _ ( staubert 1992 ) .",
    "_ beppo - sax _",
    "( orr 1998 ) and _ asca _ ( yaqoob 1994 ; cappi 1998 ) have also observed 3c  273 , along with _ euve _ , which allowed the soft excess to be detected down to @xmath0  0.1  kev ( marshall 1995 ) .",
    "the actual form of the soft excess could not previously be determined , due to lack of precision in the low - energy instruments : power - law , blackbody and thermal bremsstrahlung models produced equally acceptable fits .",
    "the epic ( european photon imaging camera ) instruments ( strder 2001 ; turner 2001 ) on board _ xmm - newton _ are improving the situation , however , helping to distinguish between different models much more readily .    the soft excess of 3c  273 has been previously found to vary ( turner 1985 ; courvoisier 1987 ; turner 1990 ; grandi 1992 ; leach , mchardy & papadakis 1995 ) ; _ ginga _ observations ( saxton 1993 ) found that its fractional variability was larger than that in the corresponding power - law component .    in this paper , nine _ xmm _ observations of 3c  273 are presented . in section  [ sec : xmmobs ] the _ xmm _ datasets are given and the problem of pile - up discussed .",
    "section  [ sec : specanal ] covers the spectral analysis , concentrating in particular on the soft excess emission .",
    "sections  [ sec : rgs ] and [ sec : om ] cover the rgs ( reflection grating spectrometer ) and optical data respectively , while section  [ sec : disc ] discusses what can be determined from the spectral fits , with the final conclusions given in section  [ sec : conc ] . throughout the paper , h@xmath4 is taken to be 50  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 and q@xmath4  =  0 .",
    "3c  273 is one of the _ xmm - newton _ calibration targets , so is frequently observed by the instruments . at the time of writing , the quasar has been observed in revolutions 94 , 95 , 96 , 277 , 370 , 373 , 382 , 472 , 554 and 563 , spanning a time period of two and half years , from 2000 - 06 - 13 to 2003 - 01 - 05 .",
    "these data are a combination of public and proprietary calibration observations .",
    "since the pn was in timing mode during revolution 382 , this observation was excluded from the analysis ; mos 1 was in timing mode for four of the nine observatiosn , so only mos 2 data were used .",
    "the observation during revolution 472 is considerably shorter than the others ; this , combined with the low luminosity of 3c  273 at this time , leads to larger error bars than measured during the other revolutions .",
    "table  [ obs ] lists the dates of the observations , together with the exposure times and instrumental set - up .",
    "the odfs ( observation data files ) were obtained from the online science archive ; the data were then processed and the event - lists filtered using xmmselect within the sas ( science analysis software ) v5.4.1 .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     a lower limit to the temperature of the accretion disc can be roughly estimated by finding the point at which the extension of the x - ray fit would produce a higher optical flux than is observed by the om",
    ". figure  [ om_bb_comp ] plots the extrapolated x - ray comptonisation model for three different input temperatures ( 10 , 5 and 2  ev ) . for temperatures below @xmath02  ev , the model over - predicts the optical flux .",
    "this can , therefore , be taken as a lower limit to the temperature of the photons producing the soft excess .",
    "however , it must be noted that 2  ev is far too low a temperature for an accretion disc such as this .",
    "disc theory is still a very uncertain area , especially at high accretion rates .",
    "collin & hur ( 2001 ) and collin ( 2002 ) find that the optical emission in agn can not be accounted for by the standard accretion disc model , concluding that , either the disc is ` non - standard ' or most of the optical luminosity does not come from the accretion disc .",
    "a much improved theory of accretion discs is clearly needed , before the relationship between optical and x - ray emission in agn can be fully understood .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) , 3c  273 has , in the past , shown a hard spectral index of @xmath0  1.5 ( or flatter ) , while the values found here ( table  [ bb ] ) are noticeably steeper .",
    "this is not likely to be due to contamination by the broad soft excess , since the values of @xmath2 for the broad - band power - law plus bb fits are very similar to the 310  kev slope .",
    "neither does it appear to be a calibration problem , since molendi & sembay ( 2003 ) also find a relatively steep slope ( @xmath2  @xmath0  1.63 ) for the mecs spectrum over 310  kev ( _ sax _ data simultaneous with _",
    "revolution 277 ) .    using the simple power - law model ( table  [ bb ] )",
    ", there is no strong correlation between 310  kev @xmath2 and the power - law luminosity over the same energy band ( figure  [ 3 - 10gamma - lum ] ) , with spearman rank giving a negligible probability of 9  per  cent .",
    "however , it is noticeable that the first six observations cluster around a 310  kev slope of @xmath2  @xmath0  1.66 , while the later three show steeper values , of @xmath0  1.77 .",
    "the open circle in this , and subsequent , plots denotes the data from revolution 472 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , of the nine observations presented here , it is during revolution 472 that 3c  273 is at its faintest over the 310  kev band ; revolution 472 is also the shortest of all the observations .",
    "ignoring this data point does not , however , lead to a significant correlation between the 310  kev photon index and flux ( 57  per  cent ) .",
    "the relationship between the slope and flux of 3c  273 has been found to vary , however .",
    "agreeing with the present data turner ( 1990 ) found that the parameters were independent , when considering _ ginga _ data between 1983 and 1988 ; this was also found from _",
    "rxte _ measurements from 1996 - 1997 ( kataoka 2002 ) .",
    "however , from 1999 - 2000 , kataoka found that the slope became _ softer _ when the flux level increased .",
    "to investigate how the soft excess is changing over time , the comptonisation model plots for each revolution were overlaid ; the result is shown in figure  [ eemodel ] . above 0.5",
    "kev the fitted spectra show a general tendency for higher flux to be associated with higher temperatures  the hotter the soft excess , the higher the energy the model extends to .",
    "revolution 472 ( orange curve ) is the exception here , with a high temperature , but a lower normalisation .",
    "however , when the model is extrapolated to lower energies , the different @xmath2s become more important , the major contribution to the model luminosity being below 0.5  kev and sensitive to the value of @xmath2 , rather than to kt .    in order to investigate how the soft excess varies , the parameters ( @xmath2 , optical depth and electron temperature )",
    "were plotted against the photon flux calculated over the 0.510  kev ( observer s frame ) band .",
    "figures  [ gamma ] , [ tau ] and [ kt ] show these results .",
    "spearman rank ( sr ) and weighted linear regression were then used to give the probability of a correlation .",
    "linear regression is a useful method , since it takes into account the errors on the measurements , whereas spearman rank does not .",
    "an inverse relation is found between the optical depth and the flux over 0.510  kev ( 98  per  cent ; slope of @xmath688  @xmath7  38 ) and is shown in figure  [ tau ] .",
    "again , excluding the revolution 472 point strengthens the spearman rank value , to 99.8  per  cent .",
    "( the regression slope stays approximately the same , since the point being ignored has relatively large error bars , so would have been less strongly weighted than the other measurements ) the other physical parameter of the soft excess ",
    "the temperature  shows a 98  per  cent positive correlation with the flux ( 99.8  per  cent without revolution 472 ) ; that is , the hotter soft excesses are brighter .",
    "this is supported by a regression fit of 5.5  @xmath7  1.3 .",
    "it must , however , be cautioned that the temperature , kt , and the optical depth , @xmath8 , are strongly coupled , as shown by equations 1 and 2 : @xmath2  @xmath0  1/(kt@xmath9)@xmath10 .    to try and determine how the regions producing the soft and hard x - rays are linked , figure  [ rms ] was plotted .",
    "this shows the fractional ( rms ) variability of the total observed counts as a function of energy , after the poisson noise has been accounted for ( edelson 2002 ) for the mos data and implies that , over the nine observations , there is very little difference between the rate of variation in the soft and hard bands .",
    "the pn results also show that rms variability does not change with energy , although the fraction variability is higher ( @xmath0  32  per  cent , compared to @xmath0  18  per  cent in the mos 2 datasets ) .",
    "figure  [ frac ] shows how the two separate comptonised components vary in flux during the nine observations .",
    "it can be seen that the soft excess component varies over a larger range than does the hotter component , although the two generally change in the same sense .",
    "this is shown by the standard deviation values of @xmath11  @xmath0  0.3 for the range in soft excess variation , compared to @xmath11  @xmath0  0.1 for the hotter , power - law component .",
    "cutting the spectrum at 0.5  kev could give a wrong impression of the total luminosity of the soft excess component in the comptonisation model , since most of the emitted flux is below this energy .",
    "for this reason , the optical depth and temperature were plotted against the flux of the extrapolated soft comptonised component , following the method for investigating the 0.510  kev energy band .",
    "it must be cautioned , however , that the fluxes and luminosities derived for this extended band are very sensitive to the parameters of the fit .",
    "the correlation between the optical depth and the photon flux ( figure  [ extraptau ] ) becomes much weaker , with the spearman rank probability being 30  per  cent for an inverse relation between the two parameters .",
    "the kt - flux is also only present at the 30  per  cent level , as shown in figure  [ extrapkt ] .",
    "neither of these probabilities is significant .",
    "if , however , the revolution 472 data point is , again , excluded from the calculation , weak correlations between the photon flux and soft excess temperature or optical depth are revealed ( 93  per  cent , positive / negative for kt/@xmath8 respectively ; using linear regression , best - fit slopes of 0.021  @xmath7  0.006 and @xmath60.43  @xmath7  0.19 are obtained ) .",
    "these correlations are weaker over the full energy band , but are in the same sense as the 0.510  kev band",
    ".    figures  [ lumvariation ] and [ gammavariation ] plot the luminosities and slopes of the two comptonised components .",
    "the soft / hard luminosities appear to be correlated over both bands if weighted linear regression is used to give the line of best fit ( @xmath0  0.14 over both bands ) ; spearman rank , however , gives an insignificant result of 74  per  cent for the 0.510  kev band , though this increases to 96  per  cent if the revolution 472 point is ignored .",
    "over 0.00110  kev , spearman rank gives a much larger probability of 99  per  cent for a positive correlation ( approximately constant with or without revolution 472 ) .",
    "the slopes of the cooler and hotter comptonised components appear to be inversely related , with linear regression giving a slope of @xmath0  @xmath61.64 , and spearman rank giving a ( fairly low ) probability of 92  per  cent for a negative correlation .",
    "it is natural to suppose that , if the soft excess were to be produced by comptonisation of thermal photons from the accretion disc , then an inverse relationship would exist between the photon flux and the electron temperature , caused by compton cooling .",
    "the positive correlation found between kt and the flux over 0.510  kev for the soft excess could well have been an artifact of the 0.5  kev cut - off .",
    "however , the same sense is observed in the correlation over the full energy band .",
    "thus , the data indicate no negative relationship between the flux and kt and , therefore , no compton cooling .",
    "this implies that the soft excess , if produced by the comptonisation of thermal disc photons , is more complex than the simple model proposed here .",
    "the total soft excess varies from 3.3  @xmath12  10@xmath13 erg  s@xmath5 up to 6.6  @xmath12  10@xmath13 erg  s@xmath5 , but this is accompanied by a modest increase in temperature .",
    "this implies both an increase in the thermal disc emission and a corresponding _ increase _ in the electron temperature : two separate mechanisms need to be invoked .",
    "note that the data are inconsistent with a constant _ photon flux _ but varying temperature ( figure  [ extrapkt ] ) .",
    "the _ xmm _ spectrum of 3c  273 has been investigated .",
    "it is found that the soft x - ray spectrum is dominated by a strong soft excess below @xmath0  2  kev .",
    "this can be well modelled by a multiple blackbody parametrisation , but is most likely to arise though thermal comptonisation of cool ( uv ) disc photons in a warm ( few hundred ev ) corona above the surface of the accretion disc .",
    "while the soft excess spectra can be fitted with the comptonisation model , the variability behaviour is not consistent with a simple interpretation of this model .",
    "the temperature of the comptonising electron cloud may vary independently of the input photon flux , or may even be positively correlated with it . if the latter were to be true , then a further link between the disc emission and the energising of the comptonising electrons would be necessary .    the individual spectra do not tend to show iron lines , either narrow or broad , neutral or ionised . however , if all the observations are co - added , a weak , broad line is detected .",
    "the work in this paper is based on observations with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission , with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa and nasa .",
    "the authors would like to thank the epic consortium for all their work during the calibration phase , and the soc and ssc teams for making the observation and analysis possible .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administation .",
