    "the development of weak lensing techniques , coupled with deep panoramic imaging surveys , has enabled us to locate clusters of galaxies via the gravitational distortion of background galaxies shapes . since the first , spectroscopically confirmed discovery of a shear - selected cluster by wittman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , there has been rapid progress toward a large , weak - lensing selected cluster catalogue .",
    "miyazaki et al . ( 2003 ) first reported the detection of several significant shear - selected cluster candidates in an untargeted 2.1 deg@xmath10 field .",
    "hetterscheidt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found 5 cluster candidates in 50 randomly selected vlt fors1 fields ( 0.64 deg@xmath10 in total ) , all of which are associated with an overdensity of galaxies .",
    "wittman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) reported 8 candidates in the 8.6 deg@xmath10 deep lens survey .",
    "gavazzi & soucail ( 2007 ) found 14 cluster candidates in the 4 deg@xmath10 cfht legacy survey ( deep ) , of which nine have optical or x - ray counterparts and are thus secure clusters .    the first sizable sample of weak lensing shear - selected cluster candidates was presented by miyazaki et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter p1 ) .",
    "their sample was obtained solely via peak finding in weak lensing density maps , and includes 100 significant peaks in a 16.7 deg@xmath10 survey area .",
    "before such a sample is used for statistical cosmological or astronomical analyses , two additional follow - up observations are required .",
    "firstly , each cluster candidate should be confirmed by independent observations , since a fraction of lensing peaks could be false positives from e.g.  the chance tangential alignment of galaxies intrinsic ellipticities ( white , van waerbeke & mackey 2002 ; hamana , takada & yoshida , 2004 ; hennawi & spergel 2005 ) .",
    "secondly , the redshifts of confirmed clusters need to be determined in order to derive their physical quantities , including mass .",
    "we have conducted a multi - object spectroscopic ( mos ) campaign that accomplishes both goals .",
    "we have measured the redshifts of a few tens of galaxies within an expected cluster scale radius ( or core radius , typically a few arcmins ) , and searched for spatial concentrations that are plausible optical counterparts of the weak lensing signals .",
    "once a galaxy overdensity is found , it is easy to determine the cluster redshift from the redshifts of member galaxies .",
    "it is important to note that cluster confirmation based on prominent galaxy concentrations would not be very effective for very high mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath11 ) , galaxy - poor systems .",
    "although our methodology can _ confirm _ normal or galaxy - rich clusters , the absence of a galaxy concentration in our fairly sparsely - sampled data therefore does not necessarily prove that a weak lensing signal is false .",
    "in addition to our primary goals , multi - object spectroscopic observations provide several useful by - products . if redshifts can be obtained for sufficient galaxies in a cluster , their line - of - sight velocity dispersion provides an estimate of the cluster s dynamical mass .",
    "mos observations can also detect multiple structures along the same line of sight .",
    "because of the relatively broad redshift window function of gravitational lensing , physically unrelated structures in the same line of sight may contribute to a single peak in a weak lensing density map , resulting in an overestimation of the cluster mass ( white et al .",
    ". it will therefore be important to quantify and properly account for such projections when computing statistics of cluster masses from weak lensing observations .    in this paper , we present results of cluster confirmations and cluster redshifts .",
    "we discuss the detailed weak lensing properties of each system and , for a clean subset of our clusters , examine statistical relations between the weak lensing masses and dynamical masses . a statistical analysis of the _ entire _ sample , taking into account additional selection effects ,",
    "will be presented in green et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we discuss our selection of cluster candidates . in  3 , we describe our new observations , data reduction and measurements of galaxy redshifts . in  4 , we identify optical counterparts to cluster candidates , and measure their velocity dispersions and dynamical masses . in  5 , we analyze the weak lensing signal of confirmed clusters . in  6 , we investigate cluster scaling relations within our sample . in  7 , we summarize our results . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : nfw ] , we calculate the gravitational lensing shear profile of a truncated nfw model .",
    "detailed discussions of each system , including comparisons of the dynamic and lensing masses , follow in appendices  [ appendix : prop ] ( for clusters we have observed ) and [ appendix : xmmlss ] ( for observations taken from the literature ) ."

    "<S> we present the first results of a multi - object spectroscopic ( mos ) campaign to follow up cluster candidates located via weak lensing . </S>",
    "<S> our main goals are to search for spatial concentrations of galaxies that are plausible optical counterparts of the weak lensing signals , and to determine the cluster redshifts from those of member galaxies . around each of 36 targeted cluster candidates , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath0 galaxy redshifts . for 28 of these targets , </S>",
    "<S> we confirm a secure cluster identification , with more than five spectroscopic galaxies within a velocity of @xmath1km / s . </S>",
    "<S> this includes three cases where two clusters at different redshifts are projected along the same line - of - sight . in 6 of the 8 unconfirmed targets , </S>",
    "<S> we find multiple small galaxy concentrations at different redshifts , each containing at least three spectroscopic galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the weak lensing signal around those systems is thus probably created by the projection of groups or small clusters along the same line - of - sight . in both the remaining two targets , a single small galaxy concentration is found .    </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the weak lensing mass of confirmed clusters via two methods : aperture densitometry and by fitting to an nfw model . in most cases , </S>",
    "<S> these two mass estimates agree well . in some candidate super - cluster systems </S>",
    "<S> , we find additional evidence of filaments connecting the main density peak to additional nearby structure . for a subsample of our most cleanly measured clusters , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the statistical relation between their weak lensing mass ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and the velocity dispersion of their member galaxies ( @xmath4 ) , comparing our sample with optically and x - ray selected samples from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> our lensing - selected clusters are consistent with @xmath5 , with a similar scatter to the optically and x - ray selected clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we thus find no evidence of selection bias compared to these other techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive an empirical relation between the cluster mass and the galaxy velocity dispersion , @xmath6km / s@xmath7 , which is in reasonable agreement with the prediction of @xmath8-body simulations in the @xmath9cdm cosmology . </S>"
