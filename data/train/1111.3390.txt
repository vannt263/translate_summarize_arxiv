    "in the recent years the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) @xcite has been used to construct a new type of estimator for the primordial non - gaussianity in the cmb characterised by the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one of the particularities of the wavelet estimator as it has been traditionally presented in the literature compared with direct bispectrum - based estimators @xcite is the absence of a linear term . in the bispectrum - based estimators",
    ", the linear term plays a key role to achieve optimality in the cases where the rotational invariance of the cmb is broken because of different instrumental complexities such as anisotropic noise or partial sky coverage ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the computational difficulties related to the inversion of the covariance matrix present in the bispectrum estimator , especially in future data sets with higher @xmath7 as for example planck , together with the unknown effect that different systematics from the instrument and background residuals might have on the estimates , motivated the search for new estimators based on different tools such as the smhw described in this paper , the binned bispectrum @xcite , the general modal expansion and polyspectra estimation @xcite , the needlets @xcite , the healpix wavelet @xcite , neural networks @xcite or a bayesian approach @xcite among others .    in a previous paper @xcite , we described the main features of the wavelet estimator based on the cubic statistics constructed from the smhw coefficient maps .",
    "those cubic terms were written as a function of the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath6 and the bispectrum of the primordial non - gaussianity . in that paper",
    "we also showed that the power of the method to detect @xmath6 , that is the variance of this parameter @xmath8 , matches that of the direct bispectrum - based estimators for ideal conditions ( full sky and isotropic noise ) and realistic conditions ( partial sky coverage and anisotropic noise ) .",
    "the wavelet estimator variance was obtained in two different ways : through the fisher matrix and by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , providing very similar results",
    ". a remarkable result of these works is the fact that the wavelet estimator is , in practice , able to reach optimality on the @xmath6 estimation without including any linear term correction .",
    "however , from several works ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it has been shown that in order to reach minimum variance , all the cubic estimators need a linear term correction .",
    "a recent work has solved this apparent controversy @xcite by showing that in wmap anisotropy conditions , the linear term correction is nearly equivalent to the mean subtraction performed for each wavelet coefficient map in the wavelet estimator .",
    "in this paper we re - examine the main statistical properties of the wavelet estimator and show the conditions to reach optimality .",
    "we compute the linear term correction for the local , equilateral and orthogonal @xmath6 shapes .",
    "in particular we see that the linear term correction for the local case provides a 1 per cent reduction in the error bars ( in agreement with * ? ? ?",
    "* for the smhw ) while the correction for the other shapes is even smaller .",
    "section [ sec : estimator ] introduces the smhw estimator , its variance and its linear correction . in section [ sec : wmap_data ] the estimator with its linear correction is applied to wmap 7-year data for the local , equilateral and orthogonal shape . in section [ sec : planck_simulations ] we explore the linear correction on planck simulations at 143 ghz for the local shape , and in section [ conclusions ] the conclusions are presented .",
    "in this section we present an approach for the @xmath6 estimator based on the statistical properties of the cubic terms of the smhw coefficients averaged over the sky . in this case",
    "we exploit the property of the smhw wavelet that performs a strong decorrelation of the data at distances larger than the wavelet resolution .",
    "the expected value of the cubic terms in the sky are obtained from the sum of a large number of almost independent elements and therefore its distribution will be close to gaussian by the central limit theorem .",
    "we will first review the smhw and its decorrelation properties and then we will construct the wavelet estimator based on those properties including the linear term correction .      detailed information about the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) and a ( non - complete ) list of applications to the cmb maps and cosmology can be found in @xcite .    given a function @xmath9 defined at a position @xmath10 on the sphere and a continuous wavelet family on that space @xmath11 , we define the continuous wavelet transform as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the position on the sky at which the wavelet coefficient is evaluated , @xmath14 is the scale of the wavelet and @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 ^ 2\\left [ 2 - \\left ( \\frac{y}{r}\\right)^2\\right ] e^{-y^2/(2r^2)}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 considering a set of different angular scales @xmath19 we define a third order statistic depending on three scales @xmath20 @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dispersion of the wavelet coefficient map @xmath23 . in the particular case of @xmath24 , @xmath25 . for a particular pixelization on the sphere , eq .",
    "[ themoments_qijk ] can be written as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total number of pixels of the map , @xmath28 is the number of pixels available after combining the extended masks corresponding to the three scales @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the wavelet coefficient in the pixel @xmath33 evaluated at the scale @xmath29 after subtracting the mean value over the wavelet coefficient map outside its extended mask .    using the properties of the wavelet",
    ", we may write the wavelet transform of the temperature map in the next form @xcite @xmath34 using the isotropic properties of the cmb and the properties of the wavelet , we can obtain the angular coefficient correlation @xmath35 between any pair of pixels @xmath36 and @xmath37 separated by an angular distance @xmath38 and for two angular scales @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the window function of the wavelet at a scale @xmath14 and it is given by the harmonic transform of the mother wavelet of the smhw @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of the wavelet coefficients at scale @xmath39 is simply given by @xmath43 .",
    "[ fig_corr_smhw ] we show the correlation of the wavelet coefficients as a function of the angular distance @xmath44 for several values of the resolution scale @xmath14 .",
    "as can be seen , the smhw produce an effective decorrelation of the signal at angular distances above the resolution scale @xmath14 .",
    "considering the strong decorrelation produced by the convolution of the smhw on the temperature anisotropies , we can now apply the central limit theorem to the cubic statistics defined in eq .",
    "( [ themoments_qijk ] ) .",
    "since the average value is calculated from the sum of a very large number of almost independent elements ( of the order of the number of pixels in the sphere with size that of the resolution scale @xmath14 ) , then its distribution should be very close to a gaussian .",
    "this is actually seen in fig .",
    "[ histo_qiii ] , where the distribution of the cubic terms for different smhw scales are shown .",
    "these distributions have been obtained from mc simulations of gaussian temperature anisotropies .",
    "the previous results indicate that , for gaussian temperature anisotropies , a good representation of the n - point distribution of the quantities @xmath45 can be given in terms of a multinormal distribution .",
    "allowing now for the presence of weak non - gaussianity for the temperature anisotropies ( e.g. an amplitude for the primordial non - gaussianity consistent with wmap data ) one can use the next likelihood for the @xmath6 parameter : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the cubic statistics corresponding to the observed data , @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the covariance matrix of the cubic statistics . a further test to check that the @xmath45 are normally distributed can be done by considering the property",
    "that @xmath52 is a @xmath53 distribution with one degree of freedom . in particular , @xmath54 should provide the 1(2)-sigma or 68 per cent(95 per cent ) confidence intervals for the @xmath6 parameter .",
    "using mc simulations we have checked that this is the case for the @xmath45 statistics .",
    "after straightforward calculation , it can be easily seen that the @xmath6 estimator in this case is given by @xmath55 while that the variance of the @xmath56 parameter in eq .",
    "( [ estimator_nolinearterm ] ) is given by @xmath57 this estimator has already been shown to be nearly optimal on wmap data @xcite without the need of subtracting any linear term .",
    "however , as stated in @xcite , from all the possible cubic combinations of three gaussian variables , the wick polynomials are shown to have minimum variance .",
    "this implies that in order to have a strictly speaking minimum variance estimator , a linear term correction needs to be included .",
    "in fact the linear term subtraction is equivalent to the mean subtraction at each wavelet coefficient map @xcite for low levels of anisotropy .",
    "this is indeed the procedure that has been followed in @xcite and it explains the competitive results obtained just by subtracting the mean using the estimator in eq .",
    "[ estimator_nolinearterm ] .",
    "the linear term correction for the wavelet estimator can be written as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is given by eq .",
    "[ estimator_nolinearterm ] and @xmath60 with @xmath61 in the next sections we apply the wavelet estimator to wmap 7-year data as well as to planck simulations and compare the results obtained with and without the linear term correction .",
    "we have computed the linear term correction to the cubic wavelet @xmath6 estimator for the three shapes with a relevant interest in many inflationary models : the local , equilateral and orthogonal shapes ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the estimator can be easily applied to other bispectra with a separable shape @xcite .",
    "results taking into account only the cubic contribution are already published @xcite .",
    "we have selected the same set of 15 angular scales from @xmath62 arcmin to @xmath63 arcmin used in @xcite .",
    "we have considered the v+w wmap data optimally weighted by the @xmath64 maps per radiometer in order to maximise the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we also consider the same wmap @xmath1 mask and its extended masks for each wavelet angular scale .",
    "the cubic covariance matrix has been computed using 10000 gaussian simulations .",
    "a principal component analysis has been performed in order to avoid contamination from the lowest noisy eigenvalues of this covariance matrix without losing non - gaussian signal @xcite .",
    "the two point correlation matrices needed for the linear term correction have also been estimated with 64000 gaussian simulations .",
    "this number of simulations is needed in order to achieve the required precision in the estimation of the correlation matrices .",
    "we have applied the estimator to one set of 10000 gaussian maps and the wmap data .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubic_linear_fnl ] for the three considered shapes . in the left panels ,",

    "the vertical lines correspond to the actual wmap data values estimated with the cubic estimator ( red ) and the linearly corrected estimator ( black ) . in the right panels ,",
    "we compare the best - fitting @xmath6 values for the same set of gaussian simulations .",

    "finally in tables [ table_fnl_results_local ] , [ table_fnl_results_equilat ] and [ table_fnl_results_ortho ] the previous results are summarised .",

    "25 of @xcite is also provided . for each case",
    ", we observe a small reduction of the error bars when the linear term is included .",
    "the largest correction is introduced in the local shape , where @xmath68 is reduced from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ( i.e. a reduction of 1 per cent , in agreement with * ? ? ?",
    "the correction for the other two cases , equilateral and orthogonal is also negligible ( about 0.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively ) .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite for the equilateral shape , where the standard deviations of @xmath6 without the linear term were found closer to the lower fisher limit than in the local shape , suggesting a less important contribution of the linear term correction .",

    "in this paper we have performed a comprehensive study of the @xmath6 wavelet estimator .",
    "we have considered the main statistical assumptions to derive the estimator in terms of the cubic quantities @xmath78 and showed the conditions to reach optimality .",
    "we have found that the smhw wavelet produces an important effective decorrelation of the signal at angular distances above the angular resolution @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the cubic quantities are nearly gaussian owing to the central limit theorem and using this property we have found an expression for the likelihood of the @xmath6 parameter in terms of the cubic statistics .",
    "we have also included a linear term correction following the wick polynomials introduced by @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have confirmed that the linear term correction is basically achieved through the mean subtraction that we carry out on the wavelet coefficient maps for each angular scale @xcite .",
    "we find that , in this case , the linear term correction only reduces the error bars about 1 per cent for the local case using wmap data .",
    "this correction is even smaller for the equilateral and orthogonal cases ( 0.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively ) .",
    "the results presented in this paper are in agreement with the optimal results obtained with the wavelet estimator already published where the mean subtraction was performed @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the contribution of the linear term is negligible ( @xmath2 1 per cent ) for the smhw estimator for the three considered shapes .",
    "we have also explored the linear term correction for planck simulations at the 143 ghz channel .",
    "our results indicate that the correction for the local shape is lower than 0.4 per cent considering the expected levels of noise anisotropy for this channel and the wmap kq75 mask . from the results on wmap data",
