    "the stripe order of charge and spin has been found in several layered perovskites  @xcite and organic conductors .",
    "@xcite both of them are of pseudo two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system and have strong coulomb interactions compared to hopping integrals .",
    "a single band system can be a model of organic conductors , while , in layered perovskites , a number of relevant orbitals depends on filling , crystal field , exchange splitting _ etc_. the inter - site coulomb interaction is essential to the charge stripe in organic conductors and , then , extended hubbard model is adopted to explain the mechanism of stripe order there .",
    "@xcite in layered perovskites , however , an origin of the stripe order is still controversial particularly in the perovskites other than cuprate , while the order in cuprate is attracting much attention in conjunction with marked suppression of @xmath7 with hole doping @xmath8 and rich physics .",
    "nickel compound la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 ( lsno ) is a typical system of static stripe order of charge and spin .",
    "@xcite it is an insulator with the total spin @xmath9 in wide range of sr doping @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xcite this stability of insulating phase is quite different from the variety of the phases in cuprate case ; cuprate changes to metal , insulator and superconductor depending on the hole concentration .",
    "lsno at @xmath3 shows the highest spin order temperature @xmath12k , because stripe order of charge and spin is commensurate with lattice periodicity .",
    "the periods of charge and spin stripe are not generally commensurate to the lattice .",
    "incommensurability @xmath13 increases with increasing @xmath10 and satisfies @xmath14 in the region @xmath15 , @xmath16 in the region @xmath17 . here",
    ", incommensurability @xmath13 is defined as displacement of peak positions of super structure from reciprocal lattice points .",
    "increase of @xmath13 saturates in the region of @xmath18 with the value @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite in the region @xmath20 , there exists commensurate charge ordered phase without magnetic order , called a checkerboard type charge order , between @xmath21k and @xmath22k .",
    "@xcite another experimental fact in lsno is the dependence of the ratio between two lattice constants along with @xmath23- and @xmath24-axis ( @xmath25-ratio ) on @xmath10 .",
    "the observed @xmath25-ratio has a maximum value at @xmath4 ,",
    "because holes are first doped into the @xmath26-orbital in a region @xmath27 and , then , additional holes are doped into the @xmath28-orbital when @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite    we present two issues on lsno in this paper by using both lsda+u method and the exact diagonalization of many body hamiltonian .",
    "the first issue is that the inter - site coulomb interaction is essential to static charge order in doped layered perovskites .",
    "not only hartree energy but also correlation energy due to the inter - site coulomb interaction ( beyond hartree - fock approximation ) is important . because electron configurations fluctuate between hole ( ni@xmath5 ) and non - hole ( ni@xmath6 ) states by hopping , the correlation energy is maximized at @xmath4 .",
    "in this situation , we need to diagonalize the many - body hamiltonian to know the true ground state at @xmath4 .",
    "the second issue is that the spin stripe order in lsno is attributed to the structure of multi - orbitals .",
    "a spin moment on a hole site is strongly correlated with surrounding spin moments on non - hole sites in the multi - orbital system with fractional occupation , which is a essential difference from the case of single - orbital systems .",
    "the stripe order in layered perovskites is , in some cases , attributed to the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion .",
    "@xcite in the present system , however , this is not the case , because the jt distortion is not consistent with the local symmetry of the observed stripe order of charge and spin in @xmath3 lsno . in the e@xmath30 type jt distortion coupling with the @xmath31 orbitals , two oxygen atoms at opposite positions , centering ni site , displace in opposite directions with each other .",
    "consequently , the periodicity should be doubled along with -ni - o-@xmath32-o - ni- line .",
    "it contradicts to the observed tripled structure .",
    "distortion with ungerade mode can be consistent with the observed order but increases the total energy .",
    "the spin structure at @xmath4 is inconsistent with the jt distortion , too .",
    "there is another candidate for the origin of stripe order in layered perovskites .",
    "that is long - ranged coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite also it is well known that the inter - site coulomb interaction stabilizes the charge order in quarterly filled ( single - orbital ) extended hubbard model .",
    "@xcite thus , the inter - site coulomb interaction can stabilize the electronic structure of insulator with static stripe order . in the electronic structure of lsno ,",
    "degeneracy of 3d @xmath31-orbitals causes two important parameters : splitting between @xmath28-orbital and @xmath26-orbital and the hopping integrals .",
    "it is reported that different values of these variables bring the system different order .",

    "one is the absence of correlation energy arising from the charge fluctuation between ni@xmath6 and ni@xmath5 configuration .",

    "this change of the hole character agrees with the experimental results described in sec .",
    "[ sec_intro ] .",

    "the second is that in the temperature range @xmath86 , the checker - board type charge order is observed in the real system with @xmath4 .",
    "the third reason is that the positive value of inter - site coulomb interaction stabilizes the checker - board type charge order .",

    "the hartree energy may be insufficient to stabilizes the charge order . in the real system ,",
    "the electron localized on the ni@xmath6 site has extending tail on ni@xmath5 site and the center of localized electron can be fluctuating among ni@xmath6 and surrounding ni@xmath5 sites , in order to lower the correlation energy . because the ground state wavefunction is represented by a single slater determinant in lsda+u calculation , the fluctuation of the center of localized electron is neglected , then the correlation energy is underestimated .",
    "moreover , in the hartree energy , the contribution of the tail to the charge on ni@xmath5 site and the contribution of the head to the charge on ni@xmath6 site are treated as if they were separate electrons .",

    "in conclusion , lsno with @xmath4 and @xmath137 are both insulator with charge and spin stripe order . in both systems , diagonal hole stripes",
    "are separately located on ni@xmath5 site in order to reduce hole - hole interaction energy induced by inter - site coulomb interaction @xmath95 .",
    "we discussed the important role of multi - orbitals and mixing of multiple slater determinants especially in high - doped @xmath4 system , where the charge order is induced by the correlation energy of the inter - site coulomb interaction @xmath95 .",
    "charge order and the inter - site coulomb interaction @xmath95 are directly related to the energy gap in the excitation spectra of the system with @xmath4 .",
    "spin stripe occurs only under the condition of the existence of the charge order , with a help of anisotropy @xmath107 in diagonal hopping . thus the spin stripe is determined by the electronic structure with smaller energy scale than that of the charge stripe .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of @xmath138 . though the spin stripe is related to anisotropy , the mechanism is not of jahn - teller type unlike the usual ordering in transition metal oxides , because anisotropy in lsno does not couple to the jahn - teller mode .",
    "the stability of lnso in different hole concentration @xmath10 depends sensitively upon several physical quantities , e.g. @xmath139 , @xmath42 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 , @xmath95 and @xmath107 , and we believe that we have successfully shown the new scope of the combination with the first principles electronic structure calculations and the many - electron theory .",
    "we have developed a very useful novel tool for the extremely large matrix of extended hubbard hamiltonian , the shifted - cocg method , which will be explain more details elsewhere .",
    "lastly we comment on layered cuprates .",
    "the band gap of la@xmath140cuo@xmath67 ( lco ) is 2  ev , narrower than la@xmath140nio@xmath67 , and hole doping makes systems metallic .",
    "@xcite due to these facts , the screened coulomb interaction in lco becomes smaller than in lsno and the energy gain by hole hopping is more important in doped cuprates .",
    "this may be one of reasons why the hole stripe in la@xmath141nd@xmath142sr@xmath143cuo@xmath67 runs in a direction along the n.n .",
    "pair and the hole concentration is one per two cu sites in the stripe .",
    "@xcite    the authors are benefited greatly from discussions with m. imada , y. tokura , and n. nagaosa .",
    "calculations were done at the supercomputer center , institute for solid state physics , the university of tokyo and at research center for computational science , okazaki , japan .",
    "this work was partially supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research in priority areas `` development of new quantum simulators and quantum design '' ( no.170640004 ) of the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology , japan .",
    "we use lanczos method and the inverse - iteration method with cg method alternatively in order to obtain the exact eigenvectors .",
    "these methods work well for getting ground states , but careful treatment must be taken for solving two smooth eigenvectors with respect to @xmath95 in sec .",
    "[ sec_x_half_charge_order ] .",
    "because both methods are the energy minimization process , iterative application of them , with no care , gives the eigenvector of lower eigen energy than that of the aiming eigen energy smoothly connected from the solved eigen energy at adjacent values of @xmath95 , though one chooses the solved eigenvector at adjacent value of @xmath95 as a starting vector .",
    "when the two levels are nearly degenerate , this problem becomes seriously important . in the present case ,",
    "at least three energy levels cross with changing @xmath95 from 0  ev to 0.5  ev , because at @xmath96ev , the lowest three levels are @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 in the unit of ev , ( the first one is a level of state s and all the three levels are doubly degenerate ) .",
    "state s locates at the @xmath147  ev at @xmath96  ev , higher than these three levels , while state s is the ground state at @xmath100  ev .",
    "the first technique to avoid this problem is to use small number of the dimension of the submatrix tridiagonalized by lanczos method , since lanczos method has stronger tendency to reduce trial eigenvalue than that of inverse - iteration with cg method .",
    "we tried successfully the dimension in the range 0 @xmath74 80 depending on the case .",
    "the second technique is to control the trial eigenvalue so that the residual is minimized and the trial eigenvalue does not jump , in the whole processes . here",
    ", the residual is defined as @xmath148 .",
    "because increase of the residual is a sign of the transition into lower level , once it occurs , we dispose a new ( and possibly lower ) trial eigenvalue .",
    "lastly , the inner product among resultant eigenvectors of respective values of the specific parameter ( @xmath95 in the present case ) must be checked .",
    "the large value of inner product assures the smoothness of connection to the resultant eigenvectors . in the present case , the inner product between state s at @xmath100  ev and that at @xmath96  ev equals to 0.54 and the inner product between state d at @xmath100  ev and that at @xmath96  ev equals to 0.73 .",
    "these values are large enough to assure the smoothness of these eigenvectors , because no other eigenvectors at the end point @xmath96  ev can have larger inner product than above respective states .",
    "one might have a question why state s has a finite weight 0.045 of sdcco s at @xmath100 , though the state has no charge order .",
    "we conclude that the sdcco s are not overweighted by following discussion .",
    "because the energy scale of the charge order is larger than that of spin order in the present system , we neglect the spin configuration in each slater determinant , and count only the charge degrees of freedom .",
    "strong @xmath35 inhibits the configurations with site occupation more than two and zero and there exist @xmath149 types of the charge configurations , where the site occupations are restricted to be one or two . a number of charge configurations with complete checker - board type order equals to two . assuming that all configurations have the same weight due to the absence of charge order , resultant weight of sdcco s equals to @xmath150 , which is consistent with above 0.045 .",
    "first we discuss the value of the energy gap @xmath151  ev in two way , applying two extreme approximations , and show how inter - site coulomb interaction opens the energy gap .",
    "one of two approximations is such that hil and lal are approximated by single particle excitation related to an extended hole / electron , and the other is such that they are approximated by a single particle excitation of a site localized hole / electron . in the actual picture ,",
    "excitations are described by dressed quasi - particle / hole and not by a single particle / hole , as is discussed later in the present section .",
    "we begin with the case that hil / lal is approximated by single particle excitation of an extended state . due to large splitting @xmath41  ev between @xmath28- and @xmath26-orbital",
    ", hole is doped into @xmath26-orbital .",
    "therefore , low energy excitation mostly consists of @xmath26-orbital and we neglect @xmath28-orbital in the present paragraph .",
    "the single electron wave functions of hil and lal belong to the same symmetry group labeled @xmath152 as in table [ tab_occ ] . by unitary transformation , four plain waves labeled @xmath152 change the forms into four checker - board type wavefunctions @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "these four wavefunctions give the two types of charge distribution .",
    "one type of them is shown in fig.[fig_charge_order ]  ( b ) and the other is obtained with exchanging hole and non - hole sites .",
    "two wavefunctions @xmath153 and @xmath154 do not interact with on - site coulomb interaction @xmath35 , because @xmath157 on each lattice point .",
    "instead , the interaction between them with inter - site coulomb interaction @xmath95 is roughly estimated as @xmath158 , where @xmath159 in the present case .",
    "this is occupied- and unoccupied - splitting .",
    "assuming @xmath153 is occupied , then @xmath154 is unoccupied and vice versa .",
    "the same situation occurs for another pair of wavefunctions @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "thus , the system becomes insulator with gap roughly estimated as @xmath160  ev , except @xmath100  ev where all the occupied- and unoccupied- states are degenerate ( see fig.[fig_spectral_function_vs_v](b ) ) .",
    "though the correlation induced by inter - site coulomb interaction causes the splitting between occupied- and unoccupied- states ( the energy gap ) , this mechanism is different from the normal mott insulator , induced by on - site coulomb interaction @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite in addition to that , there is another difference between the current mechanism and that of mott insulator ; the wavefunction of hil and lal have checker - board type charge order , not sharing the center of charge distribution in the current mechanism , unlike they shares the center of charge distribution in mott insulator . however , there is a problem with this estimation of the gap . following the present estimation",
    ", energy gap vanishes in the bulk limit , because the gap is inversely proportional to the system size .    in the next estimation , hil / lal excitation",
    "is approximated by a single particle excitation of site localized hole / electron . neglecting hopping integrals ,",
    "the ground state of the present hamiltonian consists of four ni@xmath6 ( spin triplet , u@xmath161v@xmath161 ) and four doublet ni@xmath5 ( spin doublet , u@xmath161 ) located on respective sublattice , where u and v denote @xmath28- and @xmath26- orbital respectively .",
    "all these components are assigned to the slater determinants with complete checker - board type charge order ( sdcco s ) in sec .",
    "[ sec_x_half_charge_order ] .",
    "then the lal is @xmath26-orbital of ni@xmath5 and the hil is @xmath26-orbital of ni@xmath6 ( both have a majority spin ) . consequently , the energy gap is estimated as @xmath162 + 8v-[e({\\rm ni}^{3+})+4v]\\ } -\\{e({\\rm ni}^{2+})-e({\\rm ni}^{3+})\\}=4v=0.5$]ev , where @xmath163 denote the ground state energy of ni ion for each ionization state .",
    "this is an exact solution even in the bulk limit .",
    "the result of the present calculation is in the intermediate region of above two estimations ; the calculated energy gap @xmath151  ev is greater than @xmath164  ev in extreme cases by the extended hil / lal approximation and less than @xmath165  ev by the site localized hil / lal approximation .",
    "therefore , in the calculated excitations ( with respect to state d at @xmath96  ev in sec .  [ sec_x_half_charge_order ] ) are well described by the wavefunction in intermediate region between site localized and extended states . and",
    "the split between occupied- and unoccupied- states occurs due to long - ranged ( inter - site ) coulomb interaction , though they are _ not sharing the center _ and does not have large overlap .    finally , we discuss on the bulk limit of the energy gap in the present calculation .",
    "taking the limit such that transfer integrals go to infinity , the system becomes paramagnetic metal .",
    "taking the limit such that transfer integrals go to zero the system becomes antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "therefore , there exists a critical transfer integral where the bulk limit of the system changes from insulator ( metal ) to metal ( insulator ) .",
    "the high weight of the slater determinant with complete checker - board type charge order ( @xmath166 at @xmath96  ev , as in fig.[fig_weight_sdcco ] ) strongly suggests that the present choice of transfer integrals makes the bulk limit insulator , and that is consistent with the real lsno ( @xmath4 ) .",
