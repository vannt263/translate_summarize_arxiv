    "a black hole is defined by the existence of the non - singular event horizon @xmath4 , which is the boundary of the region of space - time which particles or photons can escape to infinity , @xmath5 .",
    "bekenstein has shown that the black hole can be considered as a `` closed '' thermodynamical system with the temperature , proportional to the surface gravity @xmath6 , and the chemical potentials , proportional to the angular velocity @xmath7 or electric potential @xmath8 , if there is , at the horizon @xcite .",
    "the argument was based on the hawking s area ( increasing ) theorem @xcite and the black - hole analogue of the first law with the temperature @xmath9 , which is `` non - negative '' , and the entropy @xmath10 for the horizon area @xmath11 , which is `` non - decreasing '' , i.e. , satisfying the second law of thermodynamics , due to the area theorem , as well as being non - negative .",
    "later , hawking found that the black hole can radiate , from the quantum mechanical effects , with the thermal temperature @xmath12 in accordance with the bekenstein s argument @xcite [ i am using units in which @xmath13 ] ; in this case , the black hole would not be a closed system anymore but interacting with its environments such as the generalized second law needs to be considered @xcite .",
    "there is an alternative approach to compute the hawking temperature by identifying @xmath14 as the periodicity of the imaginary time coordinate which makes the metric regular at the horizon @xcite and this approach has been widely accepted ; no counter examples for this approach have been known so far , as far as i know .",
    "now , since the surface gravity @xmath6 at the horizon can be computed from the metric unambiguously , the hawking temperature in this approach is @xmath0 determined also",
    ". this would be the origin of the widespread belief that the hawking temperature @xmath15 uniquely determined by the metric in @xmath16 case . and",
    "also , it has been widely believed that the hawking temperature @xmath15 positive , as in the bekenstein s original argument @xcite .",
    "actually , this belief has been closely related to the `` positive mass theorems '' for black holes and the fact that the mass is grater than the modulus of the charge , if there is @xcite .    in this letter , i argue that this belief _ might not _ be true in the recently discovered black holes which include the exotic black holes and the black holes in the three - dimensional higher curvature gravities .",
    "in the spin systems the temperature can be negative , due to the upper bound of the energy spectrum @xcite . recently , a number of black hole solutions which have similar upper bounds of the black hole masses have been discovered @xcite .",
    "i have argued that the hawking temperatures for these systems might not be given by the usual formula @xmath17 @xcite , which is non - negative , but by new formulae which @xmath18 be @xmath3 depending on the situations @xcite .",
    "the argument was based on the hawking s area theorem and the second law .",

    "@xcite , @xmath28 is a fixed value of @xmath30 field strength in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath28 is proportional to the coefficient of a gravitational chern - simons term in refs . @xcite and it does not apply to our case park:0602 . ] . here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given by @xmath31 which become the usual mass and angular momentum for the btz black hole , with a cosmological constant @xmath32 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the radii of the horizons are given by , in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,    [ horizon ] r _ = l    and it is clear , from this , that the bare parameters , which are positive semi - definite , satisfy an inequality",

    "now , given the hawking temperature and angular velocity for the event horizon @xmath4 of the metric ( [ btz ] ) , following the usual approach @xcite , @xmath37 with the surface gravity @xmath38 , the black hole entropy has been identified as @xmath39 which satisfies the first law @xmath40 but depends on the @xmath41 horizon area @xmath42 @xcite , rather than the outer horizon s @xmath43 .",
    "but , there is @xmath44 physical justification for this since the second law is not guaranteed @xcite ( for an explicit demonstration , see ref .",
    "rather , i have recently proposed another entropy formula which does not have this problem @xmath45 in accordance with the bekenstein s original proposal @xcite .",
    "then , it is quite easy to see that this _ does _ satisfy the second law since the metric ( [ btz ] ) satisfies the einstein equation in vacuum , regardless of the details of the actions ,    [ eom ] r^-12 g^ r -1l^2 g^ = 0    : the raychaudhuri s equation gives the hawking s area theorem for the outer horizon @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 since this vacuum equation satisfies the null energy condition trivially @xcite ; this can be also proved by considering a `` quasi - stationary '' process which does @xmath48 depend on the details of the gravity theory @xcite .",
    "these results are closely related to the fact that @xmath49 for any ( positive ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( equality for @xmath50 ) since these describe the rates of the area changes under the positive energy matter accretion .    one interesting consequence of the new identification ( [ bh_new ] )",

    "the ( positive ) numerical coefficient in the temperature @xmath59 of ( [ t- ] ) is not determined from the thermodynamical arguments but needs some other independent identifications : this has been confirmed @xmath60 in a @xmath19 analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite ; however , in this letter i support this , in a more traditional way , by identifying the hawking temperature @xmath61 from the green function analysis for a quantum field .",
    "but , it is important to note that , regardless of the numerical ambiguity , the temperature @xmath53 becomes `` negative '' @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "this can be easily understood from the existence of the upper bound of mass @xmath64 with positive @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as in the spin systems @xcite .",
    "whereas , the temperature becomes positive for @xmath65 due to the lack of an upper bound , i.e. , @xmath66 with @xmath3 @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "these behaviors can be nicely captured in the entropy , as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( fig.1 ) , using ( [ m_j ] ) and ( [ horizon ] ) : @xmath67}.   \\label{bh_new : m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     vs. @xmath57 for various values of @xmath68=1 ( red ) , 1.5 ( green ) , 2 ( blue ) [ bottom to top ] @xmath69.,width=377 ]    here , i note that the curves in fig.1 are symmetric about @xmath70 , as in the spin systems : by the definition of the temperature @xmath71 , i have @xmath72 on the right hand side @xmath73 , whereas @xmath74 on the left hand side @xmath75 ; the two temperatures @xmath76 correspond to the same temperature for a vacuum with @xmath70 .",
    "but , note also that the entropy does @xmath48 vanish at the energy boundary @xmath77 , i.e. , extremal black hole , and this would be inherent to black hole systems , which does not occur in spin systems @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note the fact , which is crucial in the analysis of sec .",
    "iii , that the angular velocity has a lower bound @xmath78 , due to the fact of @xmath79 ; it is saturated by the extremal case @xmath33 and divergent in the limit of @xmath80 .",
    "this implies that this system is always rotating , as far as there is the event horizon @xmath4 .",
    "and also , as @xmath80 , this seems to be consistent with the fact of a non - vanishing angular momentum @xmath58 since it satisfies the conventional relation @xmath81 , with the angular velocity @xmath82 .",
    "the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with the higher curvature terms and a `` bare '' cosmological constant @xmath83 can be generally described by the action [ omitting some boundary terms ]    [ higher ] i_g= d^3 x (  f(g^ , r _ , _ ) +  ) ,    where @xmath84 is an @xmath85 scalar function constructed from the metric @xmath86 , ricci tensor @xmath87 , and the covariant derivatives @xmath88 @xcite .",

    "the btz solution ( [ btz ] ) is the @xmath91 black hole solution in vacuum . whereas , even in the presence of the generic higher curvature terms , the btz solution can be still a solution since the @xmath92 structure would be `` unchanged '' by the higher curvatures : actually @xmath93 for the btz solution and the only effects are some `` re - normalization '' of the bare parameters @xmath94 , and the newton s constant @xmath95 , giving the einstein equation    [ eom : ren ] r^-12 g^ r -1l^2_ren g^ = 0    in the renormalized frame @xcite .",

    "now , due to the renormalization of the newton s constant , the original mass and angular momentum in ( [ bare : mj ] ) are modified as    [ mj : higher ] m = m ,  j = j ,    respectively , by representing @xmath25 and @xmath26 as those in the renormalized frame @xmath98 , with the renormalized parameters @xmath99 , but still with the bare newton s constant @xmath95 , such as @xmath100 is valid . here",

    "it has been computed as @xmath107 from the wald s entropy formula @xcite .",
    "but , this is problematic for @xmath106 , though it satisfies the usual first law ( [ first : old ] ) , since @xmath108 from the area theorem which works in this case also due to the above einstein equation ( [ eom : ren ] ) that satisfies the null energy condition in the renormalized frame also , trivially .",
    "so , i have recently proposed the modified entropy @xmath109 which agrees with @xmath19 result as well @xcite .",

    ", the @xmath126 cases whose curves meet at @xmath70 does not seem to imply the _ un-_bounded mass .",
    "actually , the @xmath70 case can not be considered as the black hole spectrum because there is no horizon either ; there is a discontinuity in the mass spectrum at @xmath70 , which may be considered as an ( open ) upper bound for the left branch .",
    "the hawking temperature can be fundamentally determined by the periodicity of the thermal green functions @xcite . in the usual black hole systems",
    "this agrees with the periodicity for a regular euclideanized metric at the event horizon @xmath4 .",
    "actually , the hawking temperature for the btz metric has been determined in this way and found to be the same as @xmath120 of ( [ t+ ] ) @xcite .",
    "so , according to the widespread belief that hawking temperature be uniquely determined by the metric , the new hawking temperatures which do not agree with the usual temperature might be considered as unphysical ones .",

    "ii : there were some `` loopholes '' in the usual analyses which were unimportant for the ordinary black holes .",
    "the results are consistent with the proposals of sec .",
    "ii .    to this end",

    "this twist is not obvious in the stress tensor , but this is needed in order to have a well - defined hilbert space without the negative - norm states .",
    "this looks to be also true in the higher curvature gravities though the explicit form of the boundary stress tensor is not known said:00,park:0602 .",
    "but , the corresponding explanations in other cases are not available at present due to lack of the knowledge of the boundary cfts . ]",
    "these systems also suggest that the temperature _ might not _ be uniquely determined by the metric .",
    "so far , i have considered the cases which are described by the three - dimensional metric ( [ btz ] ) , up to extra sphere parts .",
    "but , there are also several other higher - dimensional black hole systems which show negative hawking temperatures , though not well recognized in the literatures . the @xmath166 black holes in higher derivative gravities @xcite and the phantom ( haired ) black holes @xcite are the examples ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) .",
    "the implications of these black holes to the evolution of the universe filled with the phantom energy would be quite interesting : if i consider the accretion of the phantom energy onto a black hole with `` negative '' hawking temperature , the black hole size increase @xcite , as in the wormhole cases @xcite but in contrast to the ordinary black holes with positive hawking temperatures @xcite , until a thermal equilibrium with an equilibrium temperature is reached .",
    "this equilibrium may be actually possible and can occur _ before _ the catastrophic situations in ref .",
    "@xcite if the phantom energy has the negative temperature as claimed in ref .",
    "furthermore , the generalized second law of the phantom universe with a black hole can be satisfied also with the negative hawking temperature @xcite .",
    "the details will appear elsewhere .",
    "finally , i would like to note some physical origin of the discrepancy with the standard analysis as in hawking s original work @xcite which yields the hawking temperature @xmath120 independently of any details of the gravitational theory or assumptions about the first law holding . to this end , i first note that standard result is true only for the `` riemanian '' or its equivalent `` dual '' in the teleparallel gravity @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the particle s trajectory is `` not '' completely determined by the metric only , and actually this seems to be the case for the models of this paper .",

    "@xcite and the gravitational anyon in refs .",
    "@xcite , due to the relation between the torsion and spin @xcite .",
    "for the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the explanation is not yet quite clear , but i suspect that the constant u(1 ) flux on the 2-sphere would have a crucial role in the non - standard behavior of hawking radiation also .    as an alternative aspect of the peculiarity of hawking radiation for our models",
    ", i would like to note also that dynamical geometry responds differently under the emission of hawking radiation , as i have emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , recently .",
    "for example , the emission of energy @xmath169 would reduce the black holes s mass @xmath57 from the conservation of energy , but this corresponds to the change of the angular momentum @xmath26 in the ordinary btz black hole context , due to the interchange of the roles of the mass and angular momentum as in ( [ m_j ] ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of ordinary black hole .",
    "this seems to be also a key point to understand the peculiar hawking radiation in our system , and in this argument the conservations of energy and angular momentum , which are not well enforced in the standard computation , have a crucial role . in this respect ,",
    "the parikh and wilczek s approach pari:00 , which provides a direct derivation of hawking radiation as a quantum tunneling by considering the global conservation law naturally , would be an appropriate framework to study the problem .",
    "finally , regarding the microscopic origin , it seems that the existence of the negative temperature might imply the _ spin network model _ of the quantum black holes rove:95 , analogous to the ordinary spin systems which can have negative temperature .",
