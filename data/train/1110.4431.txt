    "the dynamical mass distribution in the milky way galaxy is principally determined by analyzing the rotation curve on the assumption of circular rotation of the galactic disk ( e.g. , sofue and rubin 2001 ) . in our previous work , a large scale rotation curve ,",
    "called pseudo - rotation curve , has been obtained by combining the current rotation curve and radial velocities of globular clusters and satellite galaxies , which was used to model the galaxy s mass components ( sofue , et al .",
    "2009 , paper i ; sofue 2009 , paper ii ) .",
    "while fitting to the inner rotation curves was satisfactory , the outermost mass structure related to the dark halo was still crude because of the large scatter of the used kinematical data .",
    "it has been shown that the kinematics of satellite galaxies is crucial for determining the global dark halo models .    in this paper",
    "we construct a new large - scale , running averaged rotation curve , which we call the grand rotation curve .",
    "we analyze it more quantitatively and accurately compared with the previous work using the least squares fitting method .",
    "we adopt the ( 1958 ) profile for the bulge , exponential disk ( freeman 1970 ) , and nfw ( navaro , frenk and white 1996 ) density profile for the dark halo .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a galacto - centric distance and circular velocity of the sun of @xmath15=(8.0 kpc , 200 ) .",
    "the result of the local dark matter density will be compared with the most recent values from extensive analyses of the galactic rotation curve ( xue et al .",
    "2008 ; weber and de boer 2010 ; salucci et al .",
    "the fitted parameters for the bulge , disk , and dark halo will be used to estimate the baryon fraction inside the supposed galaxy boundary at @xmath16 kpc , a half distance to m31 .",
    "the estimated emission measure of hot gas will be compared with the observed x - ray background .",
    "figure [ vdat ] shows the observed rotation velocities @xmath17 and galacto - centric radial velocities @xmath18 , as reproduced from papers i and ii , where we compiled kinematical data from the literature and recalculated them for the galactic constants of @xmath19 ( 8 kpc , 200 ) . the inner data within @xmath20 kpc are mostly from the traditional circular velocity measurements of disk objects near the galactic plane , while some data with large scatter are the galacto - centric velocities of globular clusters .",
    "the data from 10 to @xmath2125 kpc are the mixture of usual circular velocities and galacto - centric radial velocities of globular clusters .",
    "those beyond @xmath22 kpc are @xmath18 of distant globular clusters , satellite galaxies , dwarf galaxies , and member galaxies of the local group .",

    "a rotation curve is defined by circular velocity @xmath24 in a balance between the centrifugal force and gravity , which is equivalent to the virial theorem of a circularly rotating disk objects . for non - disk objects like globular clusters and satellites that are moving in statistical and/or random orbits in virial equilibrium ,",
    "we define a pseudo - rotation velocity as galacto - centric velocity @xmath25 corrected for the freedom of motion of individual objects : it is related to the observed galacto - centric velocity as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the correction factor for possible tangential motion of the object as expected from its observed radial velocity .",
    "we thus define the rotation curve as w(r)=v_circ [ vcirc ] for disk objects ( hi gas , co gas , molecular clouds , hii regions , ob stars , and red giants in the disk ) , and w(r)=v_gc = v_gc : obs [ vgc ] for non - disk objects ( globular clusters , satellites , dwarf galaxies , local group galaxies ) .    in order to obtain a smooth rotation curve",
    ", we apply a running mean of the observed values in figure [ vdat ] .",
    "we define a rotation velocity at @xmath28 as v(r_i)=_j = i - n^i+nw(r_j ) 2n+1 , [ vaver ] where @xmath29 is the number of used data points around @xmath30 , which is taken every n steps in the data list in the order of increasing radius . in the present paper",
    "we take @xmath31 , so that the data are running averaged every @xmath31 points using their neighboring @xmath32 objects .",

    "table [ tabfit ] summarizes the obtained parameters by the present analysis , and figures [ vfitlin ] and [ vfitlog ] show the fitted rotation curves .",
    "the parameters for the bulge is not much different from the current works , because the corresponding rotation profile at @xmath115 kpc has a steep peak and the least square fitting is more independent and effective compared to the fit to other extended components like the disk and halo .",
    "the total mass of the bulge and disk system , @xmath116 , is larger than the dark mass @xmath117 inside the solar circle .",
    "the bulge - to - disk mass ratio was found to be @xmath118 is closer to that for sbc ( 0.38 : koeppen and arimoto ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "our galaxy may be , thus , a slightly late sb galaxy .",
    "we here confirm that the total mass of the bulge , disk and the dark halo within the solar circle @xmath119 is comparable to the simple spherical mass estimate for @xmath23 at @xmath8 kpc , @xmath120 .",
    "the presently larger value is mainly due to the disk effect , and partly due to extended bulge and disk components beyond the solar circle .",
    "xue et al . ( 2008 ) obtained total mass of @xmath121 within @xmath122 kpc , which corresponds to @xmath123 for @xmath23 . in our fitting result ,",
    "the total mass within 60 kpc is calculated to be @xmath124 , and is consistent with their value within the error .",
    "the nfw profile was found to fit the grand rotation curve quite well .",
    "the declining part in the outermost rotation velocity predicted by the nfw profile was clearly detected for the first time , showing the good fit to the outermost grand rotation curve at @xmath125 kpc covering the galaxy s gravitational boundary .",
    "the local value of the dark matter density in the solar neighborhood as derived from the present analysis , @xmath126 , is slightly smaller than the recently published values @xmath127 by salucci et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , while consistent with the value@xmath128 by weber and de boer ( 2010 ) .",
    "the total galaxy mass enclosed in the supposed gravitational boundary of the galaxy at 385 kpc , a half distance to m31 , is @xmath129 . as discussed in paper ii , this mass is not sufficient to gravitationally stabilize the galaxy and m31 system , and therefore the two galaxies may be embedded in a larger - scale dark matter system properly constructing the local group .",
    "if we compare the total dark matter mass with the bulge and disk mass , we obtain an upper value to the baryon - to - dark matter ratio in the entire galaxy shared by the bulge and disk to be f_bd= /(+ ) ~0.0720.018 .",
    "athough this fraction is much smaller than the wmap s cosmic value of baryon fraction , 0.17 ( dunkley et al . 2009 ) , it may be compared with the mean baryon fraction , @xmath130 , observed for groups of galaxies ( andreon 2010 ) .",
    "if we assume that the fraction in the galactic halo of radius of @xmath16 kpc is the same , a small fraction , @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) , corresponding to baryon mass of @xmath133 , may possibly exist in the form of gas filling the dark halo at density of @xmath134 @xmath135 .",
    "if the gas is diffuse hi or h@xmath136 gas , the column density would be @xmath137 and the velocity width as wide as @xmath138",
    ". the brightness temperature will be @xmath139 k for hi or @xmath140 mk for co ( @xmath141 ) . such low brightness and diffuse line emissions are extremely difficult to be detected .",
    "moreover , it is unlikely that such diffuse gas can remain neutral , because the internal motion is highly supersonic , and the gas is easily ionized .",
    "alternative forms may hi and/or h@xmath136 clouds , but it is also unlikely that such a large amount of hi or molecular clouds , almost @xmath142 times more massive than the interstellar gas in the galactic disk , have not been detected by the current radio surveys ( e.g. wakker and van woerden 1997 ) .",
    "one possible way for the gas to coexist in the dark halo would be that they are in the form of x - ray emitting hot plasma",
    ". the temperature will be @xmath13 k or @xmath0 kev , and electron density @xmath143 , corresponding to emission measure of @xmath14 for the depth of @xmath10 kpc .",
    "this emission measure is much smaller than the observed value on the order of @xmath144 toward the north galactic pole by rosat ( sidher et al .",
    "1999 ; mccammon et al . 2002 ) .",
    "hence , it is possible that the apparently missing baryons are in the form of hot halo gas , and are already seen in the rosat x - ray background emission , sharing its small portion ."
