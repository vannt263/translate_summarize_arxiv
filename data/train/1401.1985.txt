    "as the universe evolves , a second mechanism takes over .",
    "the proto - galaxies grow by accretion of external flows of pristine gas , that penetrate the dark matter halo and hit and heat a pre - existing elementary disk .",
    "cosmological simulations predict this cold - flow buildup to be the main mode of galaxy formation @xcite , and the incoming gas is expected to form giant clumps that spiral in and merge into a central spheroid @xcite , or just create thick disks that evolve by secular processes @xcite .",
    "observational evidence for this cold - flow accretion mode comes from the decrease of metallicity associated with internal star - formation regions in high redshift disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "such localized metallicity drops in the inner disk can not be explained in any other obvious way but the accretion of external metal poor gas  secular evolution produces disks with a metallicity decreasing inside - out , in sharp contrast with these observations .",
    "the same kind of metallicity deficit associated with bright star - forming regions has also been observed in a particular type of local galaxies with tadpole morphology @xcite .",
    "their images show a large star - forming clump at one end and a long diffuse region to one side .",
    "this asymmetric morphology is fairly common at high redshift @xcite but rare in the local universe @xcite , where it turns out to be associated with extremely metal poor galaxies , and so , with chemically primitive objects .these facts were used by @xcite and @xcite to conjecture that local tadpole galaxies are disks in early stages of assembling .",
    "metallicity drops associated star - forming regions have also been observed in few other local targets , including a gamma ray burst host galaxy @xcite and a blue compact dwarf  ( bcd ) galaxy @xcite .",
    "they are interpreted in terms of redistribution of centrally generated metals , with strong galactic winds and subsequent fallback , but not as cold - flow accretion events .    here",
    "we analyze the spatial variation of metallicity in a set of bcd galaxies with intense starbursts and having a range of metallicities from 2/3 to 1/20 the solar value .",
    "the purpose of the work is twofold .",
    "first , to see whether the metallicity inhomogeneities observed in tadpoles are also present in other local targets different from the original sample ( sect .",
    "[ observations ] ) .",
    "second , and equally relevant , to check if the metallicity variations remain when the metallicities are estimated via the direct method .",
    "thus we can discard a systematic error in the strong - line method employed by @xcite to infer the abundance inhomogeneities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the result of our analysis confirms that , at least in two targets , there are metallicity drops associated with intense starbursts .",
    "these drops are not present in the objects of larger metallicity .",
    "we use this fact to conjecture that a minimum metallicity around 1/10 the solar value is needed for the metallicity decrements to be observed .",
    "galaxies with metallicities below this one tenth threshold are usually referred to as extremely metal - poor .",
    "one might interpret the rarity of galaxies with metallicity drops as evidence against systematic cold - flow accretion in the local universe .",
    "thus the few observed decrements would represent vestiges of a physical process common early on , but now almost inoperative .",
    "however , several independent observations suggest that star - formation triggered by accretion of metal - poor ( perhaps pristine ) gas may be a process more common than anticipated .",
    "several of those evidences are put forward and discussed in detail in section  [ ubiquity ] , all of them involving global properties of large numbers of galaxies .",
    "the most conspicuous one refers to the so - called mass - metallicity relation .",
    "it has been recently found that for galaxies of the same mass , their current star - formation rate ( sfr ) is anti - correlated with their ionized gas metallicity .",
    "no contrived explanation is required if the two parameters are physically connected , as if the infall of metal - poor gas feeds and triggers the star formation in these galaxies @xcite .",

    "their long - slit spectra provide spatial resolution within the targets , with a spectral coverage enough to detect all the lines required for oxygen abundance analysis using the direct method .",
    "the targets cover a wide range metallicities , from 2/3 to 1/20 the solar metallicity .",
    "in addition , the galaxies form stars actively , in the sense that the current starburst is much larger than the average sfr during the galaxy lifetime . the time - scale @xmath2 to produce their stellar masses @xmath3 at the current star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath4 is typically much smaller than one gyr ( see table  [ the_table ] ) , and so much smaller than @xmath5 ( @xmath614gyr ) .",

    "we use a slit 1  wide , which limits the angular resolution , and also sets the spectral resolution to some 4.2  both in the red and the blue arms .",

    "the reduction procedure included standard bias and flatfield corrections , cosmic ray elimination , absolute flux calibration , as well as removal of sky emission lines .",
    "spectral and spatial directions were not exactly perpendicular on the ccd , and we also correct for this effect . the spectra were aligned so that each column corresponds to a single position on the sky .",
    "thus the different columns are extracted and analyzed independently in the paper , with each spectrum representing 044 on the galaxy .",
    "after these manipulations , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in h@xmath7 turns out to be between 1000 and 300 from the center to the outskirts of a typical galaxy .",

    "[ metallicities ] ) , as well as a mechanism that may lead to the metal impoverishment of regions with long - lasting intense starbursts .",

    "if the temperature in the region is not homogeneous , then the direct method underestimates the true abundances @xcite .",
    "there is a long - lasting debate in the literature on whether such temperature fluctuation exists .",
    "an artificial reduction of metallicity of 0.5  dex can be produced by temperature fluctuations of the order of 20 - 30% rms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this effect is responsible for the observed drop of metallicity , then such fluctuations should be localized in the low metallicity starburst , but not in the rest of the galaxy .",
    "we can not rule out this possibility since the interstellar medium ( ism ) of our targets is poorly known .",
    "we note , however , that the physical mechanisms proposed to generate temperature inhomogeneities favor high metallicity media rather than our xmp galaxies ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "for example , they require dust particles for heating , or they need metals for the metallicity inhomogeneities to cause the temperature fluctuations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the direct method does not consider the presence of density fluctuations , which in some real cases may be large .",
    "the resulting electron density variations are not expected to have significant impact on the abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , density inhomogeneities may have an indirect influence though induced temperature inhomogeneities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the plasma is heated by collisions with photo - ionized electrons , dense clumps present lower temperatures , leading to temperature fluctuations . detailed tailored modeling is required to assess the practical importance of the effect .",
    "if it is meant to explain the observed metallicity drops , the largest density fluctuations must occur where the metallicity appears to be lowest .    in order to determine the oxygen abundance ,",
    "the standard direct method used in the paper includes only o , o@xmath26 and o@xmath13 , but not higher ionization states .",
    "since the ionizing radiation field is harder in young star - forming regions , one may wonder whether our metallicity drops are actually caused by overlooking o@xmath27 in large starbursts .",
    "however , this potential bias does not explain the magnitude of the observed drops .",
    "even when very hot stars are present in hii regions , the correction for unseen states of oxygen is negligible small with respect to other sources of errors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ionization correction factors for o@xmath27 are never of the order of 0.5  dex as required to reproduce our observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dwarf galaxies have shallow gravitational potentials that can not retain all the metals ejected by sna explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , their metal enrichment depends critically on two competing processes , both controlled by the sna rate , that is to say , controlled by the sfr  the metal production and the metal loss . both increase with the sfr . due to this interplay",
    ", dwarfs may enrich more efficiently at mild sfrs , where the two opposite effects reach a compromise @xcite . this tradeoff between sfr and metallicity",
    "may induce the metallicity pattern that we observe .",
    "if a major starburst has been losing most of the metals for long , the gas around it would have a metallicity lower than the rest of the galaxy , where the star - formation has proceeded at a lower more - efficient rate . even though we can not fully discard this possibility , we envisage two difficulties for this explanation to work with our targets .",
    "first , the high star - formation mode quickly exhausts the original gas supply , which has to be replenished with metal poor gas that does not exist in the galaxy .",
    "second , and equally important , the gas in the star - bursting region should remain unmixed or the full galaxy would acquire a uniform metallicity .",
    "this is not easy to attain since mixing mechanisms are expected to efficiently operate in short time - scales ( myrs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of observational properties characterizing large samples of star - forming galaxies can be naturally explained if the metallicity drop associated with intense starbursts is a common phenomenon .",
    "the inflow of pristine gas provides a simple physical unifying mechanism that explains all of them , even though often it is not the only explanation of each individual observation .",
    "this section critically reviews some of these results in terms of metal - poor gas inflow triggering star - formation .",
    "the discussions are fairly qualitative , emphasizing the diversity of observations hinting at grand - scale metal - poor gas inflows in the local galaxies .",
    "local galaxies are known to follow a mass - metallicity relationship , where the larger the mass the higher the metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relationship presents a significant scatter that has been recently found to be associated with the present sfr in the galaxy .",
    "specifically , for galaxies with the same stellar mass , the metallicity decreases as the current sfr increases .",
    "the mass - metallicity relationship is commonly interpreted as due to variations of the star - formation efficiency with galaxy mass , and/or to galaxy mass - dependent metal - rich outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the former implies that low mass galaxies produce less stars for their gas , and so become more metal poor , whereas the latter relies on the metal - rich sna ejecta to be preferentially lost to the intergalactic medium by low mass galaxies , due to their shallower gravitational well .",
    "neither of these two mechanisms , however , predict the observed dependence on sfr of the metallicity  they render a metallicity set only by the galaxy mass .",
    "conversely , the observed anti - correlation between metallicity and sfr can be qualitatively understood if the star - formation is preferentially triggered and sustained by the inflow of metal - poor gas , which has no time to be well mixed with the high metallicity gas already present in the ism of the galaxies . the agreement is more than qualitative according to @xcite . using a toy model for the gas inflow ,",
    "these authors conclude that most of the star - forming galaxies with stellar masses @xmath28m@xmath29 , and many with @xmath30m@xmath29 appear to be fed by low - metallicity gas infall . the importance of metal - poor gas infall to account for the observed mass - metallicity - sfr relationship is also emphasized by @xcite and @xcite in their simple analytic chemical evolution models that include mass infall and outflows . in particular ,",
    "@xcite explain the metallicity - sfr relationship as transient departures from the secular evolution of the galaxies , triggered by sudden infalls of metal - poor gas .",
    "unlike the metallicity , the ratio between the observed n and o does not seem to depend on sfr .",
    "this lack of sfr - dependence is consistent with the relation between metallicity and sfr being maintained by episodic metal - poor inflows .",
    "the advent of fresh gas triggers star formation and drops the metallicity , but it does not change the pre - existing relative abundance between metals .    the mass - metallicity- sfr relationship is followed by large numbers of star - forming galaxies so it represents a behavior common to the typical galaxies of the local universe .",
    "it is not restricted to a few rare vestigial objects .",
    "therefore , if the above conjecture turns out to be correct , and pristine gas infall is responsible for the sfr dependence , then this infall is a characteristic of the full population of local star - forming galaxies .",
    "this conclusion is the central point of the section .",
    "bcd galaxies are high surface brightness targets and thus , relatively easy to detect .",
    "most xmps are also bcds . the luminosity of these galaxies is dominated by one or several young starbursts , however , most if not all bcds contain host galaxies with old stars .",
    "the dominant starburst is so intense that it can not be sustained for long , therefore , the bcds have to be in a transient phase .",
    "( using the arguments and symbols in sect .",
    "[ observations ] , their @xmath31 . )",
    "consequently , there must be many local galaxies in the pre  or  post bcd phase , i.e. , many quiescent bcds ( or , for short , qbcds ) .",
    "the bcd hosts show up in the galaxy outskirts , therefore , deep photometry allowed  ( , ) to characterize their photometric properties . using the typical host colors and magnitudes as proxies for qbcd properties",
    ", @xcite searched the sdss / dr6 archive for qbcd candidates .",
    "they turned out to be rather common ",
    "one out of three local dwarf galaxies is of this kind , and there are some thirty of them per bcd galaxy . their main properties , including their luminosity functions , are consistent with the bcds being qbcds observed during a starburst phase in a duty cycle where the qbcd phase lasts 30 times longer than the bcd phase .",
    "this interpretation presents a difficulty , though : the gas - phase metallicity of the qbcds is systematically higher than the metallicity of the bcds",
    ". this can not happen in a closed - box evolution , where the precursor galaxy always has lower metallicity than the follower , so that qbcds could not be precursors of bcds .",
    "the problem naturally disappears if almost _ every _ bcd starburst is preceded by the advent of fresh metal - poor gas that triggers the star formation episode .",
    "moreover , such gas - infall hypothesis beautifully explains why the _ stellar _ metallicities of bcds and qbcds agree , even though their _ gas - phase _ metallicities do not @xcite .",
    "the stars of bcds and qbcds are statistically the same because only a small fraction of galaxy stellar mass is produced in each starburst .",
    "their gas differs because bcds have just rejuvenated their ism .",
    "this behavior affects not just a few objects , but 30% of all local dwarfs .",
    "therefore the gas - infall must be a common phenomenon if it is responsible for the metallicity discrepancy between bcds and qbcds .",
    "xmp galaxies tend have cometary or other non - symmetric morphologies .even if surprising , such association seems to be the extreme case of a common relationship between morphology and metallicity followed by the bulk of the star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "@xcite parameterize lopsidedness in a sample of @xmath32 nearby galaxies , and find that at fixed mass , the more metal - poor galaxies are more lopsided .",
    "whatever process causes lopsidedness , it it is also associated with low metallicity gas in the galaxies . in the case of the xmp ,",
    "the lopsidedness is produced by off - center large hii regions , fed by pristine gas accretion either directly or indirectly  directly if the gas arrives to the disk ready to form stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or indirectly if the gas is accumulated until disk instabilities trigger star - formation in regions that must be necessarily large compared to the disk extension ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "low metallicity and lopsidedness come together naturally in xmps . if the physical mechanism that gives rise to the cometary shape of xmps is also responsible for the correlation between morphology and metallicity found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* as an occam s razor type of argument suggests ) , then triggering star formation by gas inflow must be quite common .",
    "_ green peas _ ( gps ) are star - forming galaxies which receive this name because of their compactness and green color in sdss composite images @xcite .",
    "the color is produced by an unusually large [ oiii]@xmath15007  emission line redshifted so as to contribute to the @xmath33-band color .",
    "they have some of the highest specific sfrs seen in the local universe , able to double their stellar masses in a fraction of gyr .",
    "gps seem to be high - mass versions of the most extreme starbursting bcds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are low metallicity outliers of the mass metallicity relationship @xcite . detailed analysis of their emission lines reveals complex kinematical structures with several components coexisting in only a few kpc , which are best interpreted as massive star - forming clumps in a dynamically young host galaxy @xcite . even though gps have low o metallicity , they present an overabundance of n / o@xmath34 , which is typical of aging stellar populations .",
    "this puzzling observation is naturally explained if gps have recently received a major flood of low metallicity gas @xcite  the mixing with metal poor gas reduces the metallicity ( i.e. , o / h ) , but the ratio between metal species ( n / o ) remains as in the original high metallicity ism .",
    "again , gps are not special but just extreme cases in the continuous sequence of local star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the literature contains other results that are also suggestive of star - formation triggered by gas accretion at a grand - scale .",
    "some of them are mentioned below .",
    "the neutral gas distribution of the bcd galaxies often shows large distortions , with plumes and tails , and other evidences of gas inflow or outflow .",
    "such complex hi morphology appears even in the case of isolated galaxies without obvious companions @xcite .",
    "the distorted gas around bcds has all signs of having extremely low metallicity , uncontaminated by the ongoing star - formation process , which suggests that the gas is arriving rather than being expelled from the galaxy .",
    "even large nearby spirals show local metallicity inhomogeneities that deviate from the main gradient , e.g. , m101 @xcite .",
    "the existence of inhomogeneities is in tension with theoretical expectations , which predict a virtually uniform distribution as a result of the short mixing timescales of the interstellar medium , on the order of only 100  myr .",
    "localized infall of metal - poor gas may be a viable alternative that explains this particular observation .    as we pointed out in connection with bcds and gps ( sects .",
    "[ hi_bcd ] and [ green_peas ] ) , the gas inflow produces large excursions of a galaxy in the n / o vs o / h plane .",
    "numerical models by allow to explain the observed distribution in irregular and spiral galaxies , but , in order to reach the required large excursions , the mass of the infall gas must be much larger than the mass of the gas present in the galaxy , with the infall rate exceeding the sfr .",
    "this trend for the low metallicity galaxies to show anomalous metallicity gradients ( sect .",
    "[ analysis ] ) is also observed at high - redshift . and in several low redshift targets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the metal - poor galaxies tend to show a positive gradient , whereas metal - rich ones tend to show the negative one expected from secular evolution .",
    "positive gradients naturally arise even from underlying negative gradients when metal - poor gas reaches the central regions of the disks .",
    "we measure the oxygen metallicity along the major axis of seven star - forming dwarf galaxies using different methods , including the direct method ( sect .",
    "[ metallicities ] ; table  [ the_table ] ) .",
    "two of them , j1647 + 21 and j2238 + 14 , show drops of metallicity ( @xmath60.5dex ) associated with enhanced star - formation activity in central regions . disk galaxies usually present a negative gradient , with the metallicity decreasing inside out .",
    "therefore , a deficit of metallicity in the inner galaxy is strange , and attributed to the recent arrival of external metal - poor gas that has not yet mixed up with the pre - existing ism ( sect .  [ introduction ] ; other alternatives are also examined in sect .",
    "[ rule_out ] ) .",
    "for this to happen , the incoming gas has to arrive in localized clumps rather than as an isotropic galaxy - wide accretion event .",
    "this is the explanation we suggest for the metallicity and h@xmath7 variations observed in j2238 + 14 ( fig .",
    "[ first_one ] ) , and j1647 + 21 too ( fig .",
    "[ extrange_case ] ) . the image of the latter , however , may also suggest a merger event , with the main starburst at the collision point ( see fig .",
    "[ extrange_case ] , with the two colliding disks seen edge - on forming a v - shape in a contrived but not impossible geometry ) .",
    "one of the galaxies would have to be metal - poor gas - rich , with its gas feeding the low metallicity starburst .",
    "actually , such a gas - rich minor merger can also be regarded as a cold - flow accretion event where the accreted gas stream is forming stars along the way ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the different morphology of j2238 + 14 and j1647 + 21 may be due to differences in spatial resolution , so that we have a coarser view of the former .",
    "but we can not discard that they reflect qualitative differences in the physical process responsible for the metallicity drops .",
    "our interpretation of the metallicity drops of j1647 + 21 and j2238 + 14 agrees with that given by @xcite to explain the behavior observed in a number of local tadpole galaxies .",
    "such agreement has several implications .",
    "it proves that galaxies other than the sample of tadpole galaxies @xcite present the same unusual spatial metallicity pattern .",
    "the metallicity inhomogeneities of our targets were inferred using the direct method , which discards the systematic errors usually attributed to strong - line methods .",
    "this source of error is discarded for j1647 + 21 and j2238 + 14 , thus supporting the type of metallicity pattern disclosed in tadpoles @xcite .",
    "finally , the targets showing the drops tend to have a minimum metallicity smaller than a tenth of the solar value .",
    "something similar happens with the tadpoles analyzed by @xcite , which may suggest a tenth of the solar metallicity to be an observational threshold for the metallicity drops to clearly show up .",
    "the origin of the threshold is unclear , but it may reveal an observational bias reflexing the degree of mixing of the galaxy gas .",
    "assume that all typical disks have similar fairly high gas metallicity , and they receive a parcel of metal poor gas .",
    "those galaxies that mix up this metal poor gas with the pre - existing ism before star - bursting will appear as metal rich targets of homogeneous metallicity . on the contrary",
    ", those that produce stars before mixing will look like metal poor galaxies in integrated light , presenting large metallicity inhomogeneities .",
    "the actual threshold is probably not universal since high redshift galaxies with drops have metallicities above the one tenth line @xcite .",
    "if external metal poor gas accretion feeds and triggers star formation , one would expect some kind of kinematical differences between the star - forming clumps and the underlying galaxy disk .",
    "these kinematical disturbances are predicted in numerical simulations of minor mergers and cold - flow accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and should be sought in real galaxies . some of then may have been observed already as , e.g. , the counter - rotating head found in one of the tadpole galaxies analyzed by @xcite .",
    "large metallicity inhomogeneities evidence a star formation driven , or at least stimulated , by pristine gas accretion .",
    "even though the number of local galaxies showing inner metallicity inhomogeneities is still limited , there are a number of indirect hints suggesting that metal - poor gas accretion may be more than just a vestige of the early universe .",
    "the argument relies on the existence of general rules or laws followed by large numbers of galaxies , that are naturally explained as star - formation triggered by recent pristine gas infall .",
    "it is not the only explanation , but the inflow of pristine gas provides a simple unifying physical mechanism that explain all of them .",
