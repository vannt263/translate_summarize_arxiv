    "the values found are used as a proxy for total jet power , @xmath6 . while @xmath7 dominates the power in radiation - mediated channels , it has nevertheless been found to correlate with radiative power , @xmath8 @xcite , with the latest work suggesting slopes at the steeper extreme of earlier values : @xmath7 roughly proportional to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that since the correlations plot power on both axes , common distance spreading , forcing correlations to slopes approaching unity , may be a strong factor driving the results .",
    "however , the main sample on which the correlation is founded uses radio observations to whatever depth is needed to match observed x - ray cavities , and so should be unbiased ( p.",
    "nulsen 2016 , private communication ) . in any case , as new radio - source cavities are discovered they can be tested against the claimed jet - power / radiative - power correlation , and , pushing to sources of somewhat higher power , the steeper correlation ( albeit with its broad dispersion ) seems to be holding up ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "earlier wisdom had been that strong shocks are not important in the dynamics and heat deposition of radio sources @xcite , and it is noteworthy that this situation has been seen to change at somewhat higher radio powers , where the work done in driving shocks dominates cavity power alone , for example in both 3c444 and  @xcite .",
    "when radio power is weighted by source density the correlation between jet power and radio power implies that radio sources lying close to the break in the radio luminosity function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should provide the greatest contribution of jet power in the local universe .",
    "indeed , we estimate that half of the total jet - power output should be from sources with radio powers within a factor of three of @xmath10 w hz@xmath4 at 1.4 ghz ( i.e. , @xmath11 between 1.4 and 12.6 @xmath12 erg s@xmath4 )",

    "column ( 5 ) gives magnetic field strengths that would result in enough synchrotron pressure to match the cluster value .",
    "note that a 0.6 nt field in the ne lobe would violate constraints on inverse compton x - ray emission unless there is a gas cavity at the lobe .",
    "a 0.5 nt field in the sw lobe could explain the excess x - ray seen here as inverse compton emission ( fig .",

    "it seems reasonable that departures from equipartition would not be too dissimilar between opposing radio lobes , and departures in the sense of magnetic fields being lower by factors of around three are rather common for radio - galaxy lobes in general @xcite .",
    "the ne lobe might then be expected also to show a field below equipartition and a small fractional excess of x - ray emission relative to the ambient cluster , but here a field of 0.6 nt ( table [ tab : press ] ) produces x - ray emission that exceeds our measured 90%-confidence upper limit for any x - ray excess .",
    "the measured deficit in counts as compared with cluster emission is about 13% and can be seen by eye in figure  [ fig : radio - on - cluster - smo8 ] .",
    "this suggests that , as in many other local radio sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ne lobe has evacuated its internal x - ray emitting gas .",
    "if a lobe lying within the core radius of the cluster is evacuated of gas , then for our measured value of @xmath33 we expect the surface brightness to be reduced by a factor that is roughly the ratio of the lobe radius ( @xmath34 ) to the core radius ( @xmath35 ) , or in this case around 20% . even allowing for plausible levels of lobe inverse compton emission , within the large uncertainties",
    "we conclude that a lobe cavity is responsible for the x - ray counts deficit .",
    "this begs the question as to why no cavity is seen against the sw lobe .",
    "while thermal structure on scale sizes comparable to the lobes may be influencing our results ( a much longer x - ray exposure would be required to map such structure ) , in section  [ sec : ellipticity ] we pointed out that the ne lobe is more compact and rounded than that in sw and there is a small projected offset from the cluster centre , both suggesting motion of the radio galaxy within the potential well of the cluster towards the direction of the ne lobe .",
    "instabilities of flow along the side of the trailing sw lobe may then have led to greater re - mixing of external gas in the sw .",
    "we have employed the usual method of estimating the cavity power , @xmath36 of the ne lobe as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the external pressure ( table  [ tab : press ] ) , @xmath39 is the volume ( we adopt the full @xmath40 lobe diameter from table  [ tab : radioflux ] ) , and @xmath41 is the lobe crossing time at the external sound speed @xcite . doubling the value , to account for both jets , gives a proxy for the jet power averaged over the buoyancy time of 32 myr as @xmath42 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the total 1.4-ghz radio flux density of  at 1.4 ghz is 2.6 jy @xcite , giving a radio power of @xmath43 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "these measurements are within the scatter of the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath44 reported by @xcite and updated by @xcite for radio sources in cooling - flow clusters",
    ".  does not require kinetic and thermal energy of shocked gas to bring it into agreement , as is necessary for the bright well - studied southern  radio galaxy  @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 is larger than the bolometric luminosity of the cluster gas out to a radius of @xmath45 ( table  [ tab : cluster ] ) , and so the jet is easily able to provide enough energy to reverse a cooling flow on the scale of the cluster core radius .",
    "the source  then adds to the known number of cavity radio sources , and is one of a smaller group where lobe inverse compton emission is also detected , so that lobe energetics are measured .",
    "the magnetic field is below the equipartition value , and while shocks are not detected , their presence , along with a relativistic or cold entrained proton population , can not be excluded .",
    "the fact that like ,  lies on a @xmath46 correlation supports the hypothesis that  boundary sources , when weighted by radio - source density , should dominate radio - galaxy heating in the local universe .",

    "the core of , whose x - ray counts are seen in figure [ fig : radio - on - cluster ] , has a radio spectrum that is rising at 18 ghz , indicative of self - absorption .",
    "the x - ray spectrum ( containing roughly 300 counts ) was measured from a circle of radius 1.25 arcsec , and was found to be well modelled with a relatively steep power law of @xmath47 and no excess absorption .",
    "pileup is less than 1% , which justifies ignoring the contribution of out - of - time events from the core to the cluster emission .",

    "if the x - ray is interpreted as dominated by emission from a small - scale jet and arising from the electron population responsible for the radio core , the combination of @xmath51 and @xmath52 requires the synchrotron spectrum to steepen somewhere between the radio and x - ray , and a spectral break of @xmath53 is the simple prediction for energy losses ( although observations of resolved jet knots often find somewhat larger breaks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the ne lobe occupies a cavity in the surrounding x - ray gas , while we interpret excess counts in the sw lobe as inverse - compton x - ray emission which , with the implied modest departure from equipartition , can bring the lobe into pressure balance with the external medium .",

    "the hotspot is recessed from the edge of the lobe  a feature that is sometimes interpreted as an indication of source orientation in  sources , but may instead be an indication of an internal disruption of the jet without significant generation of x - rays in  sources , as it is in the wide - angle tailed sources such as 3c465 @xcite .",
