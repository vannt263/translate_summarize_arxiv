    "the central two co peaks become a nuclear ring of radius @xmath75 , or @xmath780 pc about the dynamical center . the eastern side of this ring is brighter in co(10 ) but @xmath2co(10 ) remains rather uniform .",

    "following @xcite ( table [ tgmc ] ) , a molecular cloud is defined as a region of spatially and spectrally localized emission greater than 2@xmath30 in two adjacent channels , but need not necessarily be a gravitationally bound entity .",
    "each cloud was fit from channel maps that include only the gas over its localized velocity range .",
    "clumps separated by one beamwidth or less are considered the same gmc .",
    "cloud complexes are labeled a  h based on their locations in the lower resolution maps ; sub - clumps resolved in the higher resolution image are numbered .",
    "most of the gmcs are resolved along at least one axis , with sizes of @xmath740110 pc ( table [ tgmc ] ) .",
    "the clouds are significantly elongated , with axial ratios often greater than 2",
    ". typical position angles of the clouds , 20 - 60 , are very similar to the sky plane position angle of the bar , @xmath740 .",
    "this is not an artifact of the beam shape , since the beam is elongated perpendicular to the bar . nor is the elongation due to an underlying smooth gas component along the bar , since fits come only from maps localized in velocity .",
    "if the elongation of the clouds is a foreshortening effect due to the high inclination of maffei 2 ( 67 ; table [ tmaf ] ) , then the gmcs must be flattened perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy , that is , disk - like , rather than spherical . however , since similar elongations are observed in the molecular clouds along the bar in the nucleus of the face - on galaxy ic 342 @xcite , we consider cloud elongation along the bar more likely .",
    "_ the shapes of the nuclear gmcs are clearly affected by their location within the bar . _    with the exception of two small gmcs ( d2 and h1 ) , cloud linewidths are @xmath37 km s@xmath15 fwhm , and approach @xmath7 100 km s@xmath15 in a couple of locations .",
    "if these clouds were in virial equilibrium , then their individual masses would be in excess of @xmath38",
    ". however , these clouds are very unlikely to be in virial equilibrium (  [ gaskine ] ) .",
    "this is further demonstrated by the fact that there is no correlation between the size @xmath39 and @xmath40 in table [ tgmc ] .",
    "the co isotopologues generally follow the brighter co emission , but there are subtle differences .",
    "weak @xmath2co(1 - 0 ) emission ( fig .",

    "the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) emission ( fig .",
    "[ finti]e ) is found mostly at cloud peaks due to the higher critical density ( @xmath41 ) of the j=21 line , but some diffuse gas not associated with the clumps is resolved out . little emission off the trailing southwestern co arm ridges ( gmc h )",

    "peak main - beam temperatures are t@xmath42 k ( t@xmath43 k ) in a @xmath44 beam ( @xmath45 ) for c@xmath3o(1 - 0 ) ( c@xmath3o(2 - 1 ) ) .",
    "the hcn(10 ) map is shown in figure [ finti]d .",
    "because of its much larger electric dipole moment ( @xmath730 times co ) , hcn has a critical density nearly 1000 times higher than co , and traces high density gas .",
    "hcn predominately traces the two inner peaks of gmcs d+e and f. hcn(10 ) emission falls off with distance from the center of the galaxy faster than seen in any of the other lines ( note particularly gmc g ) .",
    "there is also evidence that the hcn is more strongly confined to the gmcs than co or @xmath2co .",
    "apparently the densest molecular gas is localized more strongly to the very center of the galaxy .      continuum maps of maffei  2 at 3.4 mm , 2.7 mm and 1.4 mm are presented in figure [ fcont ] , along with the 2  cm vla maps from @xcite .",
    "the 3.4 mm continuum has been corrected for the contribution of hcn and hco@xmath46 lines within the bandpass , and the 2.7 mm continuum map for the contribution of @xmath2co .",
    "the advantage of imaging continuum at 3 mm is that this is the part of the spectrum where the free - free emission component from regions is at its maximum relative to other sources of emission , such as nonthermal synchrotron and thermal dust emission .",
    "there are three main 3.4 mm continuum sources near the center of maffei 2 , with weaker sources towards the southwestern bar end ( gmc g ) ( table [ tcont ] ) .",
    "four central sources are found at 2 cm ; source iii has a non - thermal spectral index between 6 cm and 2 cm @xcite , and is predictably absent in the millimeter maps .",

    "the central continuum sources have spectral indices between 6 cm and 2 cm , @xmath49 , of -0.63 ( @xmath50 ) , and therefore are dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "the spectral index between 2 cm and 3.4 mm , @xmath51 , flattens to -0.1  -0.3 , as expected for regions dominated by free - free emission .",

    "our fits indicate that towards i , ii and iv the 3 mm continuum emission is dominated by the compact , free - free emission sources .",

    "emission peaks towards source ii at @xmath721 mjy beam@xmath15 .",
    "continuum fluxes at 1.4 mm are larger than the 3.4 or 2.7 mm fluxes , indicating a rising spectral index between 2.7 mm and 1.4 mm , @xmath52 , of + 1.5 .",
    "the 1.4 mm emission is therefore a mixture of free - free and dust emission , with the predominance of dust varying with position .",
    "the total flux associated with dust emission , after removing the estimated thermal free - free contribution , is @xmath53719 mjy for each source .",
    "excitation temperatures are important for understanding molecular gas properties and how they vary across the nucleus .",
    "the j=21 and j=10 lines are sensitive to relatively cool gas in gmcs , and the low j co lines , especially co(10 ) , are thermalized in all but the lowest density molecular clouds .",
    "co isotopologues thermalize at somewhat higher densities ( @xmath54 @xmath55 ) due to their lower opacity , making them excellent probes of gas excitation in this density regime .",
    "excitation temperatures , t@xmath56 , are constrained by the ratios of integrated intensities of the j = 21 and j = 10 lines , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the optical depth and filling factors of the @xmath61th isotopologue , respectively .",

    "this ratio peaks towards the central two gmc complexes ( gmc d+e & f ) , and falls with increasing radial distance .",
    "c@xmath3o(21)/c@xmath3o(10 ) is also higher at the central two emission peaks , with values of @xmath7 0.680.79 .",
    "c@xmath3o is almost certainly optically thin . from c@xmath3o(21)/c@xmath3o(10 ) , we obtain t@xmath635.46 k ( table [ tx_co ] ) .",
    "there are several regions off the gmcs ( between c and d ; h2 ) that have higher ratios .",
    "the ratios are largest between clouds : perhaps the intercloud gas is warmer than the gmcs ( although emission is weak here ) .",
    "figure [ fpvrat ] shows the average peak t@xmath64 ratios schematically as a function of velocity to show changes in excitation along the central ring .",
    "the eastern side of the central ring has the highest t@xmath56 and this is the side closest to the starburst .",

    "this is not surprising for gas in the very center of galaxies given the ( 1 ) strong noncircular motions present , ( 2 ) the failure of the thin differentially rotating disk approximation and ( 3 ) potentially strong turbulence and magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "another estimator for gravitational stability that may be more suitable to nuclear gas can be obtained from @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimates the critical density above which gas in a ring associated with an ilr can collapse to form stars as @xmath192 , or",
    "@xmath193(km s@xmath15 kpc@xmath15 ) .",
    "the epicyclic frequency at the radius of the ring is @xmath194 km s@xmath15 kpc@xmath15 which implies ring densities must be @xmath195 to be unstable to collapse . from the lvg analysis",
    "we find that the average density of the co - emitting gas along the central ring is an order of magnitude lower than this value .",
    "a lower limit to the stability of the molecular clouds can be set by assuming the clouds remain gravitationally bound against tidal forces .",
    "a cloud of mass , @xmath196 , will remain bound if @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the total mass enclosed within a galactocentric radius , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 is the size of the molecular cloud ( eg .",
    "clouds with densities of @xmath201 remain bound . for @xmath199 = 80 pc and @xmath202 m@xmath13 , values applicable to maffei 2 s nuclear ring , @xmath203 @xmath55 .",
    "this value is close to the densities inferred from our lvg analysis .",
    "the average molecular gas densities in the central ring are too low to be gravitationally unstable , and are likely only marginally tidally bound . indeed , along much of the central molecular ring not associated with the sites where the arms terminate ,",
    "little star formation is observed .",
    "it appears , then , that gravitational instability is not the answer .",
    "instead we consider the possibility that the star formation is triggered by events external to the clouds .",
    "star formation in the nucleus of maffei 2 is concentrated at the location of the @xmath204-@xmath205 orbit intersections indicated by our modeling . at these @xmath204-@xmath205 orbit intersection regions star formation",
    "appears to be triggered by the collision of gas flowing inward along the arms of the bar with the existing , more diffuse gas of the central ring .",
    "we propose that the evolution of the nuclear starburst has proceeded as follows . a recent interaction between a small companion and maffei 2",
    "has driven a large quantity of gas into the nucleus , building up a compact central bulge seen in the nir @xcite . assuming the potential generated by this compact bulge is slightly oval ( a few percent is all that is necessary ) , it has forced the nuclear molecular gas into the bar distribution currently observed .",
    "inflow along the nuclear @xmath94 orbits piles up gas at the nuclear @xmath8 orbit intersections .",
    "the interaction results in a fraction of the molecular gas going to the formation of dense cloud cores which collapse and trigger the star formation events at gmc d and just downstream of gmc f. gas not incorporated into the dense component at these locations is then tidally sheared into the moderate density , nearly uniformly distributed ring , which in turn becomes the target for future collisions with infalling gas .",
    "as long as there is gas flowing inward the burst of star formation at the arm  ring intersection can be sustained .",
    "this scenario provides a good framework for all of the molecular gas and millimeter continuum observed toward maffei 2 , with one exception , the star formation near gmc e. this star - forming complex is on the @xmath89 orbit but not at either of the @xmath94-@xmath89 intersection regions . nor is it a strong hcn source ( though some hcn emission is seen ) .",
    "why is star formation occurring here ?",
    "two possibilities come to mind : ( 1 ) the star formation is triggered by the molecular gas associated with gmc e interacting with the molecular gas towards gmc d after having traversed one half of the @xmath89 orbit .",
    "( 2 ) the star formation here reflects a slightly earlier epoch event associated with its passing through the southern @xmath94 - @xmath89 interaction region .",
    "it is now being seen with a time lag equal to the traversed portion of the ring divided by the orbital velocity . from the nuclear ring parameters",
    "the time lag would be @xmath7 1 myr . that the spectral index of the millimeter continuum is somewhat steeper towards gmc e , possibly suggesting a slightly older starburst with more evolved and",
    "less dense regions , may favor the latter scenario .",
    "the nuclear morphology of maffei 2 is similar to that observed in the bright nuclei of the barred galaxies , ic 342 , ngc 6946 and m 83 ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the central molecular zone of the galaxy ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all have nuclear bar morphologies reminiscent of their large scale analogs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in ic 342 and m 83",
    ", it remains somewhat ambiguous whether they are nuclear bars or just the inner portions of the large scale bar , due to a combination of having massive clusters that potentially influence the dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and low inclination , which hampers kinematic studies .",
    "maffei 2 s kinematics leave little doubt that it is a true double bar .",
    "in fact the co velocity field in the nucleus of maffei 2 is perhaps the best current example of nuclear non - circular , bar motions outside our own galactic center .",
    "therefore maffei 2 can be added to ngc 6946 as confirmed double barred galaxies , but with a physical scale about three times larger .",
    "it is interesting that like ngc 6946 ( and ngc 2974 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our co(10 ) observations imply the existence of straight shocks in nuclear bars .",
    "the inner ring and offset straight shocks do not appear to be common features of hydrodynamical models of secondary bars ( eg . , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , this conclusion seems to hold true for galaxies with both strong large scale bars ( maffei 2 ) and weak large scale bars ( eg . ngc 6946 ) .",
    "these nuclear bars also influence physical conditions of the gas . despite the presence of luminous star - forming complexes in these nuclei , emission from the lines of the co isotopomers",
    "is dominated by subthermally excited emission from low excitation ( t@xmath206 k ) gas , and that this emission represents the properties of the bulk of the molecular gas . while the ism in maffei 2 appears slightly warmer than ic 342 @xcite its t@xmath69 are very close to the average properties of ngc 6946 and the outer gas lanes of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "however , densities in the nucleus of maffei 2 are consistently about 0.5 dex lower than ngc 6946 and the galactic center .",
    "we suggest this comes from maffei 2 having a stronger nuclear bar than the other two nuclei , resulting in more dramatic disruption and redistribution of its nuclear ism .",
    "new aperture synthesis maps are presented for emission in the j=21 and 10 transitions of @xmath2co and c@xmath3o , as well as the j=10 lines of hcn and co in the central arcminute ( @xmath7 1 kpc ) of maffei 2 .",
    "the h@xmath4 column density as traced by optically thin co isotopologues is similar in morphology to what is implied from @xmath1co , except that the emission from the isotopologues is more closely confined to the two extended molecular arm ridges and more uniformly distributed across the central ring .",
    "the dense gas traced by hcn(1 - 0 ) is more confined to the center of the galaxy than the co emitting gas .",
    "the central molecular bar contains five main peaks that resolve into at least 17 distinct gmcs , with radii of @xmath740110 pc and linewidths @xmath36 40 km s@xmath15 . in the two innermost molecular cloud complexes , at galactocentric radii of @xmath207  ( 80 pc from the dynamical center ) , the gmcs are distinctly nonspherical , elongated along the nuclear bar , with linewidths as large as 100 km s@xmath15 .",
    "these gmcs are probably being tidally stretched due to the nuclear potential .",
    "the h@xmath4 column density for the central gmcs is @xmath208 ( @xmath209 m@xmath13 pc@xmath142 ) , corresponding to mean optical extinctions of @xmath21040100 .",
    "the molecular mass within the central 20  galactocentric radius ( @xmath7300 pc ) is 2.1@xmath170 , while the dynamical mass in the same region is m@xmath211 .",
    "the molecular mass is only a few percent of the dynamical mass .",
    "excitation temperatures , assuming @xmath212 1  ( @xmath2131 ) , are t@xmath214 k over much of the central 500 pc for both @xmath2co and c@xmath3o .",
    "these t@xmath56 values are low compared with the brightness temperature observed in co ( @xmath215 k ) indicating subthermal excitation , and that the average densities of the gmcs are probably only moderate .",
    "single component lvg analysis of the gmcs in co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath3o yield best - fit solutions of @xmath216 and t@xmath217 k. average densities estimated from the total c@xmath3o column densities are consistent with these values .",
    "the @xmath2co and c@xmath3o lines are weaker than expected from co(1 - 0 ) , which appears to be overluminous per unit gas mass across the starburst region .",
    "column densities derived from both c@xmath3o and 1.4 mm dust continuum emission imply that @xmath100(maf  2 ) is about 24 times lower than the galactic value , similar to @xmath100 values found for the centers of other large spirals , including our own .",
    "the weakness of the isotopologues at large galactocentric radii and in the `` off - arm '' spray regions of maffei 2 , suggest that in these regions either the isotopologues cease to effectively trace molecular gas or that the galactic conversion factor overestimates the molecular column .",
    "the lack of applicability of the galactic @xmath100 to the clouds in the center of maffei 2 is probably due to the effect of bar motions and strong tides on the structure and dynamics of these clouds .",
    "millimeter continuum emission reveals three prominent locations of star formation with the most intense occurring where the molecular bar intersects the nuclear ring .",
    "lyman continuum rates of n@xmath218@xmath219 s@xmath15 are implied for individual regions .",
    "the total rate for the entire nucleus is @xmath220 s@xmath15 , or sfr @xmath70.26 m@xmath13 yr@xmath15 .",
    "a p - v diagram of the nucleus of maffei 2 shows a distinct `` parallelogram '' indicating molecular gas response to a barred potential .",
    "the morphological and kinematic data confirms maffei 2 as true double barred galaxy .",
    "we suggest a bar model where the nuclear gas distribution and velocity is governed by a small nuclear bar of @xmath221110 pc .",
    "an upper limit to the mass inflow rate along the nuclear bar is @xmath222 m@xmath13 yr@xmath15 , enough to drive the current star formation rate seen at the end of the bar arms and populate the nuclear ring with gas .",
    "the locations of star formation and the dense gas in the central region appear to coincide with the location of the @xmath8 orbit crossings of the nuclear bar , consistent with dynamical triggering of the the star formation .",
