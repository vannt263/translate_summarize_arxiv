    "grand unification is one of the most serious candidates for unification of particles and gauge interactions .",
    "many properties of the standard model ( sm ) that seem mysterious or accidental , like the particle content , the cancellation of gauge anomalies , the quantization of the electric charge , appear natural in the context of grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) guts lead to a successful prediction of the weak mixing angle from unification of gauge coupling constants at the scale @xmath3 gev .",
    "also the observed smallness of neutrino masses suggests the existence of right handed massive neutrinos with at least one having mass close to the gut scale .",
    "the conventional susy guts alone have many shortcomings that remain to be completed , such as the so - called doublet - triplet ( d - t ) splitting problem and the too fast proton decay problem .",
    "an appealing mechanism to achieve the desired d - t splitting is when the grand unified symmetry is broken by the compactification mechanism in models with extra spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "it has further been realized that susy guts formulated in five or more space - time dimensions give rise to many new prospectives .",
    "in such a framework , proton could be made stable by construction @xcite or can proceed through dimension six operators @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 problem is naturally absent when the gauge group is broken by geometry of the extra - dimensions due to a continuous @xmath5 symmetry @xcite .    the purpose of this work is to study the gauge coupling unification in five - dimensional susy so(10 ) guts described in @xcite and @xcite . in the context of guts based on the gauge group @xmath2 , an entire generation of quarks and leptons belongs to the same irreducible spinor representation together with a right handed neutrino . predicting the existence of right handed neutrinos",
    ", @xmath2 provides a particularly interesting framework to realize the see - saw mechanism explaining naturally the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "however , the breaking of so(10 ) in five - dimensions ( 5d ) to the sm group is more complicated than the breaking of su(5 ) in 5d .",
    "since the reduction of grand unified symmetries by the type of orbifolding considered here does not reduce the rank of the group @xcite , the breaking of so(10 ) in 5d must be achieved by a combination of orbifold compactification and conventional brane - localized higgs mechanism .",
    "two different approaches have been considerd in literature and their main difference deals with different localization of higgs mechanism , that can takes place either on the ps brane @xcite or on the so(10 ) preserving brane @xcite .",
    "we perform a detailed analysis in order to point out the impact of different choices of so(10 ) breaking on the unification of gauge coupling constants . as guiding principles , we want to reproduce mssm spectrum at low energies , while maintaining the nice feature of orbifold guts like the automatic d - t splitting .",
    "we find , both analitically and numerically , that the influence of the higgs mechanism on the unification is not trivial and needs seriously to be taken under consideration .    in sec .",
    "2.1 and 2.2 we shortly review the orbifold construction and we focus on two different breaking chains in order to reduce so(10 ) gauge group , namely pati salam breaking chain and su(5 ) breaking chain .",
    "we notice that only the former can succesfully maintain the automatic d - t splitting and so we concentrate our studies on that .",
    "the further breaking of the pati - salam gauge symmetry to the sm gauge group can be accomplished via brane - localized higgs machanism . in sec .",
    "2.3 we carefully analyse the effects of the higgs mechanism , considering the models @xcite and @xcite already mentioned , denoting them as pattern i and pattern ii respectively .",
    "for each of them we study all the possible values that can be assumed by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field , focusing on two different regimes , that is high scale brane breaking ( case a ) and brane breaking at an intermediate scale ( case b ) . then in sec .",
    "3 , following @xcite , we perform a detailed next - to - leading order analysis of gauge coupling unification , including two - loop running , heavy thresholds coming from kk particles , light thresholds from susy particles and so(10 ) violating terms , due to the presence of kinetic terms at the ps brane , allowed in principle by the theory .",
    "we pay a particular attention to the study of the heavy thresholds , highlighting the main difference between various patterns .",
    "it s well known that the renormalization group equations , including the two loop contributions , predict a value of the strong coupling constant @xmath6 higher than nearby 9@xmath7 of its experimental value .",
    "a more precise gauge coupling unification can be obtained requiring an opposite contribution derived from kk particles in order to bring back @xmath6 inside the experimental interval .",
    "what we notice is that only for pattern ii and for the case of high scale brane breaking , the kk corrections have the correct sign . in sec .",
    "4 we confirm our previus results by performing a more detailed numerical analysis and in sec .",
    "5 we conclude .",
    "we consider minimal supersymmetric so(10 ) guts in 5 dimensions based on models constructed in @xcite .",
    "the 5-dimensional space - time is factorized into a product of the ordinary 4-dimensional space - time m@xmath8 and of the orbifold @xmath0 , with coordinates @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 .",
    "the fifth dimension lives on a circle @xmath12 of radius @xmath13 with the identification provided by the two reflections : @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 . after the orbifolding ,",
    "the fundamental region is the interval from @xmath17 to @xmath18 with two inequivalent fixed points at the two sides of the interval .",
    "the origin @xmath17 and @xmath19 represent the same physical point and similarly for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . when speaking of the brane at @xmath17 , we actually mean the two four - dimensional slices at @xmath17 and @xmath19 , and similarly @xmath18 stands for both @xmath22 .    generic bulk fields @xmath23 are classified by their orbifold parities @xmath24 and @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "the fourier component @xmath32 of fields with opposite parities @xmath33 acquires a mass @xmath34 upon compactification , while the component of fields with same parities acquires a mass @xmath35 . as we will see , the structure of the even and odd kaluza - klein ( kk ) towers is crucial for the gauge unification .",
    "only @xmath36 has a massless component and only @xmath36 and @xmath37 are non - vanishing on the @xmath17 brane .",
    "the fields @xmath36 and @xmath38 are non - vanishing on the @xmath18 brane , while @xmath39 vanishes on both branes .",
    "the theory under investigation is invariant under n=1 susy in 5d , which corresponds to n=2 in four dimensions , and under so(10 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "the gauge supermultiplet is in the adjoint representation of so(10 ) and can be arranged in an n=1 vector supermultiplet @xmath40 and an n=1 chiral multiplet @xmath41 .",
    "we introduce a bulk higgs hypermultiplet in the fundamental representation of so(10 ) which consists in two n=1 chiral multiplets @xmath42 , @xmath43 from 4-dimensional point of view .",
    "the parities of the fields are assigned in such a way that compactification reduces n=2 to n=1 susy and breaks so(10 ) down to the ps gauge group @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 assignments are given in table [ t1 ] @xcite .",
    "the break down of n=2 to n=1 is quite simple and is achieved by the parity @xmath24 . as illustrated in table [ t1 ] , @xmath42 and @xmath40 have even @xmath44 parities , while @xmath43 and @xmath41 have odd @xmath44 parities and then vanish on the brane @xmath17 .",
    "the additional parity @xmath25 respects the surviving n=1 susy and can break the gut gauge group .",
    "in fact , if we denote the ps and the so(10)/ps gauge bosons as @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively , from the assignments of @xmath47 parities of table [ t1 ] for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , it turns out that , on the brane @xmath18 , only @xmath45 survives with the ps gauge symmetry .    the projection @xmath47 can furthermore split the higgs chiral multiplet @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) in two chiral multiplets . ] : @xmath48(@xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 contains scalar higgs doublets @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 contains the corresponding scalar triplets @xmath54 and @xmath55 . as an important consequence of the parity assignments for the higgs fields in table [ t1 ] , only the higgs doublets and their superpartners are massless , while color triplets and extra states acquire masses of order @xmath56 , giving rise to an automatic d - t splitting .",
    "gauge symmetry would allow a mass term for the @xmath42 on the brane @xmath17 or a mass term for the @xmath50 ( and/or the @xmath57 ) on the brane @xmath18 as pointed out in @xcite , thus spoiling the lightness of the higgs doublets achieved by compactification , but such a term can be forbidden by explicitly requiring an additional u(1)@xmath58 symmetry @xcite .",

    "for this regime , in fact , we can employ the numerical solutions of the algebraic equations ( [ gbmassi ] ) and ( [ gbmassii ] ) for the gauge boson spectra .",
    "we obtain subsequently the numerical dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath70 and find that @xmath64 is negative anyway for both patterns i , ii",
    ". then the case b , where the brane - localized higgs gives a vev less than the compactification scale , is also strongly disfavored from the viewpoint of the unification of the gauge coupling constants .",
    "in this section we will perform a more detailed numerical study in order to confirm the preliminary analysis given in sections ( [ nleffects ] ) and ( [ heavy ] ) .",

    "+ in principle , the gauge coupling unification can be restored if we increase the contribution from the brane kinetic terms to intervals larger than @xmath78 .",
