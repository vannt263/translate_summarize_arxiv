    "a critical challenge for the program of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is the formulation of a semi - classical limit that reproduces general relativity ( for a survey on lqg see @xcite ) . in this note",
    "we propose a separable version of lqg , based on an ordered system of nested graphs , and show that it contains normalizable semi - classical states for which the lqg operators , including a version of the hamiltonian , descents to their classical counterparts .    essentially , the model which we present is identical to the traditional formulation of lqg except that the kinematical hilbert space is constructed as an inductive limit taken over an infinite set of 3-dimensional , nested cubic lattices .",
    "these lattices have a natural interpretation as the coordinate system in which the ashtekar variables are formulated . on a classical level the holonomy and flux functions living in a system of cubical lattices separates the points in the phase space , and therefore a rich enough system of functions to completely describe the classical system .",
    "this formulation of lqg is not a priori diffeomorphism invariant , since it explicitly depends on a chosen coordinate system , nor is it invariant under rotations and translations .",
    "worse yet , it does not even permit an action of these symmetry groups and thus this approach may seem questionable .",
    "however , results on semi - classical states obtained in the article @xcite have convinced us that this approach deserves further analysis .    the article @xcite deals with the physical interpretation of spectral triples constructed over a configuration space of connections closely related to the configuration space in lqg , see @xcite . essentially , this spectral triple is the construction of a dirac type operator _ on _ the space of connections .",
    "the main achievement of the article was the construction of semi - classical states on which this operator reduces to the dirac hamiltonian of a fermion coupled to gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the construction of this limit apparently requires a system of nested lattices .",
    "the insight obtained in @xcite is that it seems possible , from a setup based on nested , cubic lattices , to restore all spatial symmetries in a kind of continuum limit .",
    "this limit is constructed so that all dependency on finite parts of the system of lattices is removed .",
    "we believe that this points towards a general method of quantization , where the lattices only serve as an intermediate step and where the final continuum limit discards dependencies on finite parts of these lattices .",
    "this resembles the continuum limit of lattice gauge theory and is analog to the way that a riemannian integral does not depend on quantities of measure zero .",
    "presently we only know how to perform this continuum limit for specific states and only in combination with a classical approximation .",
    "we suspect , however , that it may be possible to perform this limit for the whole construction , that is , for the algebra and for the hilbert space .",
    "this paper differs from @xcite in that it does not deal with a construction of an euler - dirac type operator , but only with the quantized operators of lqg , i.e. the holonomy operators , the flux operators , the area operators and the volume operators , as well as a version of a hamilton operator . as a consequence",
    "the involved hilbert space is the space of square integrable functions of a completed space of connections , and tensoring with the car - algebra is not required .",
    "we consider the semi - classical states constructed in @xcite , adopted to the setup without the car - algebra , and show that all the lqg - operators have the right semi - classical limits .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the classical setup , general relativity formulated in terms of connection variables , as well as the holonomy and flux variables . in section 3",
    "we construct the kinematical hilbert space and represent the holonomy and flux variables as operators hereon .",
    "section 4 deals the semi - classical states and in section 5 and section 6 we show that the flux , area and volume operators have the right classical limit , as does an operator version of the hamiltonian . in section 7",
    "we give a discussion .",
    "we will in this section recall the formulation of canonical gravity in terms of connection variables ( for details see @xcite ) .    first assume that space - time @xmath4 is globally hyperbolic .",
    "then @xmath4 can be foliated as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a three dimensional hyper surface .",
    "we will assume that @xmath6 is oriented and compact .",
    "the fields in which we will describe gravity are    * @xmath7-connections in the trivial bundle over @xmath6 . these will be denoted @xmath8 .",
    "* @xmath9-valued vector densities on @xmath6 .",
    "we will adopt the notation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the @xmath9-index .    on the space of field configurations , which we denote @xmath12",
    ", there is a poisson bracket expressed in local coordinates by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the delta function on @xmath6 .",
    "the rest of the brackets are zero .",
    "these fields are subjected to constraints ( euclidian signature ) given by @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the field strength tensor , of the connection @xmath17 .",
    "the first constraint is the hamilton constraint , the second is the diffeomorphism constraint and the third is the gauss constraint .",
    "these field configurations together with the constraints constitute an equivalent formulation of general relativity without matter .      the crucial point for quantization of the kinematical part of gravity in lqg",
    "is the reformulation of the poisson bracket in terms of holonomies and fluxes . for a given path @xmath18 in @xmath6",
    "the holonomy function is simply the parallel transport along the the path , i.e. @xmath19 given an oriented surface @xmath20 in @xmath6 the associated flux function is given by @xmath21 the holonomy function for a path will also be denoted with @xmath22 and the flux function will be denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath18 be a path and @xmath20 be an oriented surface in @xmath6 and assume @xmath18 ends in @xmath20 and has exactly one intersection point with @xmath20 .",
    "the poisson bracket in this case becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the pauli matrix with index @xmath11 .",
    "the sign in ( [ poisson1 ] ) is negative if the orientation of @xmath18 and @xmath20 is the same as the orientation of @xmath6 , and positive if not .",
    "if @xmath18 instead starts in on @xmath20 one gets the poisson bracket @xmath26 but now with the reverse sign convention . if @xmath18 is contained in @xmath20 the poisson bracket is zero .",
    "we will in this section give a brief description of the involved hilbert space and the quantized operators on it . for further details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath27 be a cubical lattice on @xmath6 .",
    "we will assume that edges are directed and that these give rise to a coordinate system in such a way that the edges correspond to one unit at the coordinate axis and that the orientation of the coordinate axis coincide with the orientation of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath28 be @xmath27 subdivided @xmath29-times .",
    "we define @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of edges in @xmath28 , and @xmath32 .",
    "we have hence to each edge in @xmath28 associated a copy of @xmath33 .",
    "a smooth connection @xmath17 gives rise to a point in @xmath34 via @xmath35 there are canonical maps @xmath36 which simply consist in multiplying the two elements in @xmath33 attached to an edge in @xmath28 which gets subdivided in @xmath37 .",
    "define @xmath38 where the limit on the right hand side is the projective limit . since each @xmath34 is a compact topological haussdorf space",
    ", @xmath39 is a compact haussdorf space .",
    "it is easy to see that the maps @xmath40 induces a map @xmath41 and that this is a dense embedding , see @xcite    the main technical tool in @xcite was that this projective system can be rewritten into a system of the form @xmath42 where the maps consist in deleting copies of @xmath33 s .",
    "the way it is rewritten is however not unique .",
    "it depends on a labeling of the new degrees of freedoms which appears from going from level @xmath29 to level @xmath43 .",
    "we choose to label the edge appearing to the left in a subdivision as the degree of freedom , see figure 1 .",
    "define @xmath44 where the measure on the right hand side is the normalized haar measure .",
    "next define @xmath45 this will be the hilbert space on which we will define the quantized operators .",
    "a path @xmath18 in @xmath46 gives rise to a bounded function @xmath47 with values in @xmath48 via @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the extension of the holonomy map from @xmath51 to @xmath39 , see f.ex .",
    "therefore @xmath22 has a natural action on the hilbert space @xmath52 .    to construct the flux operators first look at an edge @xmath53 .",
    "the first guess for a flux operator associated to the infinitesimal surface @xmath54 sitting at the right end point of @xmath55 is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the left invariant vector field on the copy of @xmath7 associated to @xmath55 corresponding to the generator in @xmath9 with index @xmath11 , and where @xmath58 is the right invariant vector field on the copy of @xmath7 corresponding to edge in @xmath59th subdivision with left end point in the right endpoint of @xmath55 , see figure 2 .",
    "if @xmath18 is a path which which runs through @xmath55 and only has one intersection point with @xmath54 then @xmath60=i\\frac{1}{2}h_p\\sigma_a,\\ ] ] and if @xmath18 is a path that leaves @xmath54 on the other side with one intersection point then @xmath60=i\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_a h_p,\\ ] ] i.e. the relations ( [ poisson1]),([poisson2 ] ) are realized as commutator relations .",
    "if @xmath18 is a path that runs through @xmath54 and does not involve the copy of @xmath7 corresponding to @xmath55 , see figure 3 , then @xmath61=0.\\ ] ]    we can remedy this by adding a vector field @xmath62 , which only acts on copies of @xmath7 coming from edges in @xmath63 , see @xcite for details .",
    "thus @xmath64 realizes the poisson bracket ( [ poisson1 ] ) , ( [ poisson2 ] ) .",
    "we will in this section briefly recall part of the properties of the semi - classical states constructed in @xcite .",
    "this construction used results of hall @xcite , and was inspired by the articles @xcite .",
    "let @xmath65 be a point in the classical phase space .",
    "the semi - classical state @xmath66 with respect to this point have the properties :    1 .   for any path @xmath67 and any @xmath68 [ hol ] @xmath69",
    "this in particular means that the expectation value in the limit @xmath70 on a path in @xmath71 is just the holonomy the connection @xmath17 along the path .",
    "[ efelt ] for an edge @xmath53 in direction @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the right end point of @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath75 the corresponding expectation value will be zero .",
    "@xmath76 .",
    "the properties [ hol].,[efelt ] . also hold for polynomial function on @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath78 and for more general functions in @xmath77 .",
    "property [ hol ] . is a consequence of the peakedness of @xmath79 around @xmath80 . in particular",
    "when the edge becomes small , @xmath79 is centered around `` @xmath81 '' .",
    "since left and round invariant vector fields coincide in the identity on the group , for small edges we have @xmath82",
    "in this section we will compute the expectation value of the flux , area and volume operator on the semi - classical states .",
    "the definitions of the operators are adoptions of corresponding operators in lqg to the setting of the lattice , in which we are working .",
    "let @xmath20 be a surface in @xmath6 which consists of parts of faces of the lattice @xmath83 .",
    "define the flux operator @xmath84 where @xmath85 means that the right end point of @xmath55 belongs to a part of @xmath20 orthogonal to @xmath55 .",
    "let us for notationally simplicity assume that @xmath20 is contained in a @xmath86-plane and with the same orientation .",
    "the expectation value gives @xmath87 thus expectation value of the flux operator on the semi - classical state reproduces the classical value of the flux operator .",
    "we have in the above calculation used that the expectation value for the right invariant vector fields approaches those of the left invariant vector fields as @xmath70 , and we have also used that for edges in @xmath63 only the right invariant part of @xmath88 contributes , and therefore only with a factor @xmath89 .",
    "this is the reason the @xmath90 prefactor shows up .",
    "the area operator for a surface as above is defined by @xmath91    lets again for notationally simplicity assume that @xmath20 is contained in a @xmath86-plane and with the same orientation .",
    "the expectation value becomes via the same calculation as for the flux operator @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the area of @xmath20 with respect to the metric given by the field @xmath94 , see for example @xcite .",
    "let @xmath95 be a vertex in end let @xmath96 be the three edges running into it which are labeled be a copy of @xmath7 .",
    "we will for simplicity denote @xmath97 by @xmath98 .",
    "define @xmath99 for a space region @xmath100 in @xmath6 define @xmath101 where @xmath95 are the vertices in @xmath83 .    a computation similar to the ones before give @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the volume of the region @xmath100 with respect to the metric induced by @xmath94 .",
    "we will start be rewriting the hamilton plus the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "let @xmath104 and @xmath105 be the lapse and shift field . then @xmath106 where @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is the @xmath7-trace",
    ".    we will give a quantized version of this expression integrated .",
    "let @xmath95 be a vertex in @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 be the smallest loop in @xmath28 in the @xmath111-direction with @xmath95 as base point .",
    "let @xmath112 be the two vertices in @xmath109 in the @xmath111 directions running into @xmath95 .",
    "define @xmath113    finally define @xmath114 where the sum runs over all vertices with property above and all @xmath29 .    using that @xmath115",
    "when @xmath29 approaches infinity we get @xmath116 the prefactor @xmath117 in ( [ locham ] ) shows up because we are quantizing the hamilton constraint without the inverse determinant .",
    "the crucial difference between the approach proposed in this paper and that of lqg is the absence of the action of the diffeomorphism group . to justify the approach proposed here one must identify a mechanism which restores such an action . the construction of the semi - classical states hints , in our opinion , towards such a mechanism , since it shows that the symmetries are restored in a certain continuum limit combined with a classical limit .",
    "the idea is to understand the entire theory as a continuum limes , much alike lattice gauge theory , where any dependency on finite parts of the lattice vanishes .",
    "the difference between this approach and lattice gauge theory , then , is that this continuum limit is not a priori dependent on a background metric .    to be concrete , what we have in mind is to take the continuum limit without the semi - classical limit .",
    "this means that the states which we aim to consider live on infinitely small edges and varies continuously in the space .",
    "thus , we wish to consider sequences of states , labelled by depth in the inductive system of lattices , and to impose a kind of smoothness condition on these states with respect to the underlying manifold .",
    "a technical issue is the question of convergence . in this paper",
    "we have computed the @xmath118 limit , whereas the appropriate thing to do would be to prove that the limit as @xmath119 exists , and then take the classical limit @xmath120 .",
    "this will of course require further analysis .",
    "notice that the type of semi - classical states described in this paper is not a complete set of states .",
    "the reason being that they are insensitive to anything living on finite parts of the lattices .",
    "this corresponds to a large amount of arbitrariness concerning the operators with respect to this continuum limit .",
    "this should , in our opinion , again indicate a limit of the entire construction so that such semi - classical states indeed form a complete set in some limiting hilbert space , and where operators are defined uniquely .",
    "so far , the construction is set with a euclidean signature .",
    "the lorentzian case is characterized by a complexified @xmath7 connection . in the lqg setup ,",
    "the lorentzian case is problematic since it corresponds to a non - compact group which obstructs the construction of the kinematical hilbert space",
    ". briefly stated , the inductive limit of hilbert spaces requires the identity function on the group to be square integrable , something which requires the space to be compact .",
    "however in the continuum limit which we have introduced one works with connections and not the holonomies , i.e. with the lie algebra and not the group itself .",
    "thus , one could adopt the strategy to work with @xmath7 and then obtain a complex connection by doubling the hilbert space , inserting a complex @xmath72 in appropriate places and take the continuum limit .    in section 6",
    "we have written down the hamilton and diffeomorphism constraint as a single operator constraint .",
    "thus , we aim at a construction which treats these constraints on an equal footing . concerning the hamiltonian we should point out that the expression which we write in section 6 depends strongly on the chosen coordinate system since it lacks a factor with the inverse of the square root of the determinant of the metric .",
    "thus , this expression should be understood strictly in terms of a constraint equation .",
    "alternatively , one may add this missing factor .",
    "however , this seems to ruin the otherwise aesthetically attractive form of the constraints .",
    "furthermore , we find it interesting that this issue introduces a scaling degree of freedom in the construction .",
    "one may speculate whether this points towards a connections with renormalization group theory ."
