    "a time - homogeneous factor model of the risk - free interest rate term structure is one in which the time-@xmath0 spot interest rate is of the form @xmath1 and the time-@xmath0 price of a zero - coupon bond of maturity @xmath2 is of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are given non - random functions and @xmath6 is a given time - homogeneous markov process with state space @xmath7 modelling some underlying economic factor .",
    "for such a model to be sensible , the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the process @xmath10 must be intimately connected . the goal",
    "if this paper is to study this connection when the function @xmath11 is assumed to be a polynomial .",
    "the motivation for this study is classical .",
    "recall that a sufficient condition for the bond market to have no arbitrage is that there exists an equivalent probability measure @xmath12 under which the discounted bond prices",
    "@xmath13 , defined by @xmath14 are local martingales for all @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , a sufficient condition to ensure that the discounted bond prices are local martingales is the union of the following two assumptions : firstly , an analytic assumption that the function @xmath9 is a classical solution of the partial differential equation @xmath16 for a given spacial domain @xmath17 and for given functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with boundary condition @xmath20 and secondly , a probabilistic assumption that @xmath10 is a weak solution of the stochastic differential equation @xmath21 taking values in @xmath7 for all @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a brownian motion under the fixed pricing measure @xmath12 and @xmath24 .    in principle , the above partial differential equation with boundary condition can be solved numerically whenever the functions @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath8 are suitably well - behaved . however , resorting to a numerical method to solve the partial differential equation can be too slow to use practice for the purpose of calibrating the parameters of the model , and indeed , it obscures the relationship between the dynamics of the factor process and the resulting bond prices .",
    "therefore , there has been considerable interest in developing tractable models , where the function @xmath9 is of reasonably explicit form .",
    "perhaps the two most famous tractable factor models are those of vasicek @xcite and cox , ingersoll & ross @xcite . in these models",
    "the factor is scalar and identified with the spot interest rate , so in the notation above , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while the functions @xmath25 and @xmath29 are affine and the function @xmath9 is of the exponential affine form @xmath30 it is easy to see that the partial differential equation reduces to a system of coupled riccati ordinary differential equations for the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the boundary condition becomes @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known that in both cases the corresponding stochastic differential equation always has a unique _ local _ solution . while the local solution to the vasicek stochastic differential equation is in fact the unique global solution , the situation with the cox  ingersoll ",
    "ross stochastic differential is more delicate : for some values of the parameters , local solutions may explode in finite time by hitting the boundary of the state space .",
    "duffie & kan @xcite studied exponential affine models where the factor process is of arbitrary dimension @xmath34 , finding conditions under which the corresponding stochastic differential equation has a non - explosive solution .",
    "subsequently , there has been a considerable body of research on the properties of these exponential affine models . a notable contribution to this literature",
    "is a general characterisation of exponential affine term structure models by duffie , filipovi & schachermayer @xcite .",
    "an exponential affine model can be considered a special case of the family of exponential quadratic models .",
    "an early example of a quadratic model was proposed by longstaff @xcite , and has since been developed and generalised by jamshidian @xcite , leippold & wu @xcite , and chen , filipovi & poor @xcite among others .",
    "one may wonder if there exist non - trivial exponential cubic ( or higher degree ) models .",
    "filipovi answered this question in the negative , by showing that the maximal degree for exponential polynomial models is necessarily two .",
    "that is to say , the exponential quadratic models are indeed the most general class of exponential polynomial models .    in this article , we consider a related class of models , in which the function @xmath35 itself is a polynomial .",
    "for instance , in the case where the factor process is scalar - valued , the function @xmath9 is of the form @xmath36 for @xmath37 differentiable functions @xmath38 .",
    "one of the main results is a classification of all such models when @xmath9 is assumed to satisfy a partial differential equation of the form of equation  .",
    "it turns out that the functions @xmath25 , @xmath29 and @xmath8 are necessarily polynomials of low degree and the functions @xmath39 solve a system of coupled linear ordinary differential equations . in light of filipovi",
    "s maximal degree theorem for exponential polynomial models , it might come as a surprise the degree @xmath40 is not constrained .",
    "we further find necessary and sufficient conditions on the model parameters such that the corresponding stochastic differential equation has a non - explosive solution .",
    "this work is inspired by the interest rate model of siegel @xcite .",
    "he showed that for all integers @xmath34 there exist an explicit affine functions @xmath8 and explicit quadratic functions @xmath25 , such that the partial differential equation has a solution @xmath9 such that @xmath35 is affine for all @xmath41 . note that in this case @xmath42 vanishes identically , and hence the function @xmath43",
    "need not be specified to verify the partial differential equation .",
    "furthermore , he showed that for a certain choice of @xmath26 that the corresponding the stochastic differential equation has a non - explosive solution valued in the bounded state - space @xmath44    we mention also the rational model of brody & hughston @xcite .",
    "working under the objective measure @xmath45 , the state price density is modelled @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are deterministic functions and @xmath49 is a @xmath45-martingale .",
    "we show in section  [ se : extensions ] that the brody  hughston model is a special case of the time - inhomogeneous polynomial models considered here .    just as the brody  hughston model and the siegel model described above , most of the polynomial models of this paper ( but not all  see section [ se : unbounded ] ) have the property that the spot interest rate is _",
    "bounded_. this stands in contrast to many familiar models , such as the vasicek and cox  ingersoll ",
    "ross models .",
    "nevertheless , the range of the spot interest rate can be expressed easily in terms of the model parameters , and hence the range can be calibrated to any desired ( finite ) width .",
    "finally , a related work is that of cuchiero , keller - ressel & teichmann @xcite , who characterise a class of time - homogeneous markov process @xmath50 with the property that the @xmath40-th ( mixed ) moments can be expressed as a polynomial of the initial point @xmath51 of degree at most @xmath40 . indeed , consider the @xmath27 case and let @xmath52 be the family of polynomials of degree at most @xmath40 : @xmath53 they study the processes @xmath50 that have the property that for _ any _ degree @xmath40 and _ any _ polynomial @xmath54 , for all @xmath22 there exists a polynomial @xmath55 such that @xmath56 = h(y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in contrast , in this work we study processes @xmath10 that have the property that for a _ fixed _ degree @xmath40 and a _ fixed _",

    "for further existence results for multi - dimensional polynomial preserving processes , consult the recent paper of filipovi and larsson @xcite .    in the remainder of this article",
    "is arranged as follows . in section [ se : alg ] , we present one of the main results , a classification of scalar time - homogeneous factor models which satisfy both the analytic assumption that bond prices satisfy a certain partial differential equation and the algebraic assumption that the bond prices can be expressed as a polynomial of the factor . in section [ se : prob ] we show that a polynomial model in which the spot interest rate is bounded from below necessarily has the property that the spot interest rate is also bounded from above ; we also present an explicit example of a polynomial model in which the spot interest rate is unbounded from below .",
    "in addition , we provide a complete classification of models satisfying the probabilistic assumption that the corresponding stochastic differential equation has a non - explosive solution valued in a bounded interval .",
    "this section contains an easy - to - check formulation of feller s test of explosion for stochastic differential equations with polynomial coefficients , which might have independent interest . in section  [",
    "se : spectral ] we present a spectral representation of the bond prices in the context of a polynomial model . in section",
    "[ se : examples ] we consider a concrete example of this class of models .",
    "the cox  ingersoll ",
    "ross model is recovered from this example in the limit of degree parameter @xmath59 .",
    "the properties of this example are analysed and its parameters calibrated to us interest rate data in the case @xmath60 .",
    "finally in section [ se : extensions ] , we briefly discuss two extensions : a hull  white - type extension where the coefficients are allowed to be time dependent , and the higher dimensional case @xmath61 .",
    "this section contains one of the main result of this paper , a classification of models that satisfy the analytic assumption that the pricing function @xmath9 solves a particular partial differential equation , in addition to having the extra structural property that @xmath35 is a polynomial of fixed degree . to more clearly see the structure of the argument we consider only the time - homogeneous case with @xmath27 in this section .",
    "the time - inhomogeneous and multi - dimensional cases are considered in section [ se : extensions ] .",
    "the following theorem is of a purely algebraic , rather than probabilistic , nature in the sense the factor process is not mentioned .",
    "related probabilistic results are stated in section [ se : prob ]    [ th : main ] fix @xmath62 , and suppose that @xmath63 for @xmath37 differentiable functions @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , assume there exists functions @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath8 such that @xmath64 where @xmath7 is a non - trivial interval .",
    "if the functions @xmath39 are linearly independent , then the following holds true :    case @xmath65 .",
    "a.   @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "b.   @xmath69 solve the system of linear ordinary differential equations @xmath70    case @xmath71 .",

    "the proof is straightforward .",
    "let @xmath80 equation holds if and only if the equation @xmath81 holds identically .",

    "in this section we include some results related to the probabilistic assumption that a certain stochastic differential equation has a non - explosive solution .      in this subsection , we argue that there are good reasons to make the further assumption that the state space @xmath7 of the factor process @xmath10 in a polynomial model is bounded , at least in the one - dimensional case .",
    "recall that we aim to model the price @xmath124 at time @xmath0 of a zero - coupon bond of maturity @xmath2 by the formula @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the economic factor at time @xmath0 .",
    "since the payout of the bond is its face value @xmath127 , there are economic grounds to assume that the bond prices are bounded .",

    "assume that @xmath8 has the property that there exists a constant @xmath131 such that @xmath137 if @xmath35 is a non - constant polynomial for some @xmath138 then the interval @xmath7 is bounded .",
    "notice that the assumption that the spot rate @xmath139 is bounded _ from below",
    "_ implies that the bond prices are bounded from above . in the case of a one - dimensional polynomial model , boundedness of @xmath35",

    "the message of proposition [ th : bounded ] is that the assumptions that the spot interest rate is bounded from below and that the bond prices are polynomials in a scalar factor together imply that the spot interest rate is bounded from above as well .",
    "we note that many popular interest rate models respect the assumption that the spot rate is bounded from below ",
    "an example is the cox ",
    "ross model .",
    "however , one should mention that some models , such as vasicek , place no such lower bounds . in particular , while having a lower bound may be a reasonable and desirable feature , but we must grant that this assumption is not universally enforced .",
    "therefore , we briefly explore the one - dimensional polynomial model , where we drop the assumption that the function @xmath8 is bounded below on @xmath7 .",

    "note that there is no contradiction with proposition [ th : bounded ] because @xmath164 in this case .",
    "we mention here an interesting ( though a bit tangential ) observation regarding the above example .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath10 satisfies the stochastic differential equation then the process @xmath165 defines a local martingale .",
    "indeed , it satisfies the stochastic differential equation @xmath166 it is slightly less obvious that the process @xmath50 is a strictly local martingale .",
    "see , for instance , the paper of goodman @xcite for further results .",
    "as argued in section [ se : bounded ] , there are economic reasons to consider polynomial models in which the factor process takes values in a bounded interval .",
    "therefore , in this subsection we consider solutions to the scalar stochastic differential equation @xmath167 which live in a bounded state space @xmath168 .",
    "furthermore , in light of theorem [ th : main ] , we assume that the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath79 are polynomials .    to avoid trivial complications , we assume @xmath169 note that the coefficient @xmath25 is lipschitz on the closed interval @xmath170 $ ] , while the coefficient @xmath26 is lipschitz on any interval @xmath171 $ ] for @xmath172 large enough . therefore , for every @xmath173 the stochastic differential equation has a unique nested family of strong solutions @xmath174}$ ] with @xmath175 , where @xmath176 the explosion time @xmath2 is then defined as @xmath177 we are interested in the case where the solution is non - explosive in the sense that @xmath178 almost surely .",
    "the classical necessary and sufficient conditions on the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 is feller s test of explosion . see for instance chapter 5 of karatzas and shreve s @xcite book for an account .",

    "it is enough to consider the behaviour of @xmath187 near @xmath188 , as the behaviour near @xmath189 is analogous .    by changing variables",

    "the inequality @xmath301 implies the claimed upper bound on the spectrum .    of course , the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath261 are the zeros of the characteristic polynomial which has degree @xmath37 .",
