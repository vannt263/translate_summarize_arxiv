    "without a doubt , we know that : ( 1 ) gas accretes inward through protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) while angular momentum is transported outward through some combination of hydrodynamic and/or magnetohydrodynamic waves , instabilities , and turbulence ; and ( 2 ) sub - millimeter dust particles coalesce to form super - kilometer size planetesimals , through some combination of collisional agglomeration and/or gravitational clumping . the ubiquity and diversity of planetary systems imply that these processes are indeed robust ; and yet , there persists uncertainty as to the exact nature of the relevant dynamical mechanisms .",
    "theoretical research has progressed on two parallel tracks : purely hydrodynamic processes versus magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for comprehensive reviews .",
    "@xcite applied the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) of @xcite and @xcite , and demonstrated that magnetic fields can destabilize keplerian shear , leading to turbulence and outward transport of angular momentum .",
    "however , there exist relatively dense , cool and nearly neutral `` dead zones '' in ppds ( @xmath51 - 10 au ) that likely lack sufficient coupling between matter and magnetic fields @xcite , except perhaps in thin surface layers that have been ionized by cosmic rays or protostellar x - rays @xcite .",
    "a review of the substantial mri in ppd literature is beyond the scope of this work ; we refer readers to the relatively recent review @xcite on transport and accretion processes in ppds .",
    "we do note that recent work has moved far beyond ideal mhd to include non - ideal effects such as the hall term and ambipolar diffusion , both which seem to make mri - driven turbulence less effective in dead zones @xcite .",
    "convective overstability ( cono ) and the vertical shear instability ( vsi ) have gained attention on the purely hydrodynamic front . in cono ,",
    "radial entropy gradients that would be stable according to the solberg - hiland criterion in the adiabatic limit may yet be unstable in the limit of efficient thermal relaxation @xcite .",
    "the chief obstacles for cono are that the cooling time must be relatively short , @xmath6 , and the radial entropy gradient must be negative so that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the radial brunt - visl frequency .",
    "the latter constraint requires a disk surface density profile that is significantly flatter than most standard models . in vsi , vertical shear induced by radial gradients of temperature ( e.g. ,  a thermal wind , a baroclinic effect ) that would otherwise be stable to the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) in the adiabatic limit may yet be unstable in the limit of rapid thermal relaxation @xcite .",
    "however , the cooling times must be especially short : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the aspect ratio of the disk @xcite .      in @xcite",
    ", while we were trying to develop models for 3d vortices in the midplanes of ppds , we serendipitously discovered that the stratified regions above and below the midplane rapidly filled with anticyclonic vortices and cyclonic vortex sheets . at the time",
    ", we hypothesized that internal gravity waves propagated away from the midplane and deposited their energy in stratified regions where the shear rolled vorticity perturbations into new vortices .",
    "however , our original explanation was not entirely complete .",
    "@xcite , hereafter , correctly diagnosed the true mechanism for the formation of these vortices and in the process identified a new purely hydrodynamic instability , which we now call the  zombie vortex instability \" or zvi . in order to get at the essential nature of the phenomenon , stripped out complicating features of a protoplanetary disk ( e.g. ,  spatially varying gravity and brunt - visl frequency ) and numerically investigated simple couette flow with constant gravity and constant brunt - visl frequency in the limit of the boussinesq approximation . in this far simpler system , found that a small perturbing vortex could trigger an instability in a rapidly - rotating , strongly stratified flow , yielding vigorous , space - filling vortices , vortex layers and turbulence .",
    "the crucial new insight in was the recognition of `` baroclinic critical layers '' as being sites that are receptive to perturbations .",
    "critical layers are special locations in a shear flow where the coefficients of the highest derivatives of the linearized equations vanish , indicating that the neutrally - stable eigenmodes are singular there @xcite . despite the singularities , critical layers are not spurious numerical solutions , but are true physical feature within the flow . in the presence of dissipation in the form of ( hyper)viscosity or thermal ( hyper)diffusivity , or with the inclusion of nonlinear effects",
    ", the eigenmodes are no longer truly singular , but still retain highly - localized regions where the gradients of the density , pressure and velocity can be extremely large ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velocityeigenmode ] ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "hereafter , we presented a cartoon model for zvi ( see fig .  1 in that paper ) .",
    "initial perturbations ( either a vortex or noise with a power - law energy spectrum ) excite baroclinic critical layers .",
    "these critical layers then generate dipolar vortex layers ( two juxtaposed oppositely - signed layers of vorticity ) ; while cyclonic vortex layers remain stable , anticyclonic vortex layers roll up into anticyclonic vortices ( i.e. ,  anticyclones ) .",
    "the crux of zvi is that these new zombie vortices then `` infect '' neighboring critical layers with perturbations , which generate new vortex sheets , which spawn new zombie vortices  and this self - sustaining process continues unabated until the dead zone is filled with zombie vortices .",
    "the instability is not an artifact of the numerical method as we have observed it with spectral codes and finite - volume codes ( e.g. ,  _ athena _ ) , with fully compressible , anelastic and boussinesq treatments of the continuity equation , with and without the shearing box , and with either hyperviscosity or real molecular viscosity .",
    "we believe zvi was not observed in many earlier numerical studies because they were missing one of the necessary ingredients : vertical stratification , high resolution to resolve the narrow critical layers , a broad spectrum of perturbations ( i.e. ,  kolmogorov , but not gaussian - peaked ) , and enough simulation time to allow the critical layers to amplify perturbations .",
    "zvi is a subcritical ( finite - amplitude ) instability .",
    "one of the chief goals of this work is to quantify the minimum threshold of perturbations to excite critical layers and trigger the onset of zvi . in",
    ", we instigated the onset of zvi with a single perturbing vortex , whereas in we investigated triggering zvi with random noise .",
    "both work to kick - off the instability , but using a single vortex has a couple advantages : first , it is far easier to observe the excitation of individual critical layers ; second , one can more readily characterize the strength of the perturbation and initialize a vortex with a well - defined vorticity .",
    "we have found , numerically , that a perturbing vortex can excite neighboring critical layers , creating localized regions of vertical velocity . in a fluid",
    "rotating rapidly around the @xmath11-axis , vertical velocity causes `` vortex stretching '' and the intensification of vorticity @xcite .",
    "the newly - created vorticity is then stretched by the shear , forming dipolar vortex layers .",
    "we observe that a weaker perturbing vortex ( as measured by the strength of vorticity ) yields weaker vortex layers , and a stronger perturbing vortex yields stronger vortex layers .",
    "it is well known that vortex layers with sufficient strength of their vorticity are linearly unstable to the development of waves which break and roll - up into discrete vortices @xcite . in our numerical experiments , we find that the strength of the initial perturbing vortex must exceed a certain threshold to yield vortex layers that are strong enough to become linearly unstable .",
    "when this occurs , the resultant first generation of zombie vortices become a source for new perturbations that excite neighboring critical layers . however",
    ", this does not always yield a run - away process . we have observed cases in which the first generation of zombie vortices may be weaker than the original perturbing vortex , enough so that strength of the perturbing vorticity is below the threshold to create sufficiently strong vortex layers can go linearly unstable , halting the further development of zvi . on the other hand ,",
    "if the strength of the vorticity in the original perturbing vortex is above some higher threshold , we observe in numerical experiments that the first generation of zombie vortices can be just as strong , exciting new critical layers and yielding vortex layers that are strong enough to be linearly unstable to roll - up into a next generation of zombie vortices , and so on .",
    "we say that the flow _ zombifies _ when this process becomes self - sustaining , filling the domain with zombie vortices and non - isotropic zombie turbulence .",
    "our numerical experiments revealed that the threshold of the initial perturbation needed to trigger zvi depend on the magnitude of the vorticity of the initial vortex , rather than on its velocity ( which could be varied while maintaining a fixed value of vorticity by changing the diameter of the initial vortex ) , or any other feature that we could identify .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether this remains true when the initial perturbations are some spectrum of random noise ( e.g. ,  turbulence with a kolmogorov energy spectrum ) rather than a coherent vortex .",
    "is it still the magnitude of the vorticity ( or a dimensionless form of the vorticity such as the rossby number @xmath12 ) that determines whether or not zvi is triggered , or does the initial velocity , energy , or some other property of the initial noise determine the onset of instability ?",
    "what are the threshold values of @xmath12 , or of the velocity ( or the dimensionless expression of the velocity , such as its mach number @xmath13 or reynolds number @xmath14 ) of the noise when zvi is triggered ?",
    "the second goal of this paper is to characterize the properties of fully - developed zombie turbulence . by doing",
    "so we can distinguish zombie turbulence from other forms of turbulence and illustrate its unique properties  in particular , those that might contribute to its ability to transport angular momentum , to concentrate or mix dust , and to disrupt other dynamics that might occur in a fully laminar ppd .",
    "we shall show that zombie turbulence is far from laminar or weakly chaotic and has many properties in common with fully - developed , homogeneous turbulence . however , zombie turbulence is not isotropic , and unlike other forms of turbulence it has a `` memory '' of how it formed .",
    "the `` memory '' is not of its initial conditions , but rather of the linear eigenmodes responsible for triggering the instability .",
    "those eigenmodes , especially , their structure in the radial direction remain imprinted on the flow indefinitely and lead to persistent anticyclonic vortices and cyclonic layers at large length scales and a more classic kolmogorov turbulence at all other lengths .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in   2 , we present the hydrodynamic equations and offer a brief review of basic turbulence concepts . in   3 , we describe the results of a series of numerical experiments focused on elucidating what triggers zvi , and demonstrate that it is the value of the rossby number of the initial noise , rather than its mach number or energy that determines whether zvi is triggered . in   4 we investigate the properties of space - filling zombie turbulence on large and small scales and show how it differs from other forms of turbulence .",
