    "since the pioneering papers of polyakov @xcite and susskind @xcite the confinement - deconfinement phase transition in finite temperature yang - mills theory has become a thoroughly studied phenomenon .",
    "this is particularly true for the ` standard ' groups @xmath1 and @xmath0 , but more ` exotic ' groups like @xmath2 have recently come into focus as well , see e.g.  @xcite . due to the nonperturbative nature of the problem progress",
    "has mainly been achieved via brute force lattice computations .",
    "nevertheless , it would be helpful to have a simpler and more intuitive understanding of the physics involved .",
    "the principal tool for this purpose is the construction and subsequent analysis of effective models .",
    "such attempts also have quite some history going back to the works of svetitsky and yaffe @xcite as well as polonyi and szlachanyi @xcite . the basic idea ( in the spirit of landau and ginzburg )",
    "is to use the order parameter of the transition , the polyakov loop , as a collective degree of freedom and formulate effective theories in terms of it . for gauge groups",
    "@xmath3 the rationale behind that is the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture @xcite which states that the yang - mills finite - temperature transition in dimension @xmath4 is described by an effective spin model in @xmath5 dimensions with short - range interactions .",
    "these ideas have initially been taken up in terms of strong coupling expansions @xcite yielding ising type spin models with an effective coupling @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the yang - mills - wilson coupling .",
    "a review of early work in this context may be found in @xcite .",
    "for an overview of more recent developments we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "early on , it has also been attempted to obtain these effective models , that is their couplings ( being the ` weights ' of the included operators ) nonperturbatively via lattice methods . in @xcite creutz s microcanonical demon method @xcite",
    "has been employed for @xmath1 .",
    "an alternative method based on schwinger - dyson equations ( sdes ) and dubbed `` inverse monte carlo '' ( imc ) was developed soon after @xcite and applied to both @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite . since then the imc approach to lattice gauge theories",
    "has largely been dormant with only a few exceptions @xcite .",
    "inspired by the success of polyakov loop models @xcite we have recently reinvestigated the feasibility of imc for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition in a series of papers . our numerical approach has consistently been complemented by analytical attempts such as strong coupling expansions and mean - field approximations .",
    "for the second - order @xmath1 transition our results may be found in @xcite and @xcite . by including up to 14 operators and 3 different group representations we were able to reproduce suitable yang - mills observables to a reasonable accuracy .",
    "the same is true for the analytically known asymptotic behavior of the effective couplings as a function of @xmath7 . in @xcite",
    "we have started to investigate effective models for @xmath0 which are generalisations of the 3-states potts model .",
    "the critical behavior of these is an interesting subject in its own right .",
    "we have found a very rich phase structure with first and second order transitions between symmetric , ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic phases .",
    "in addition there seems to be a tricritical point rendering mean - field theory approximately exact in its vicinity @xcite    in relating the effective models to @xmath0 yang - mills via imc one expects to encounter new difficulties .",
    "the first technical problem to overcome is to find the sdes which are less straightforward than for @xmath1 as the @xmath0 group manifold no longer is a sphere .",
    "this problem has been solved in @xcite and @xcite . as the @xmath0 phase transition is of ( weak ) first order , hence not continuous , the determination of the effective couplings might require fine - tuning raising the question of stability of the solutions .",
    "this will be one of the main issues to be addressed in what follows .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sota ] we suggest different effective actions as candidates for describing the polyakov loop dynamics of yang - mills theory . in section  [ sec : sdimc ]",
    "we explain how to obtain the effective couplings via two alternative sets of sdes and subsequent imc .",
    "our numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : numres ] .",
    "section [ sec : so ] concludes our discussion with a summary and outlook . some technicalities are deferred to appendices [ app : sllist][app : lambda - kappa ] .",
    "we begin by recalling the lattice definition of the untraced polyakov loop in the group representation @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the temporal link at time slice @xmath11 and position @xmath12 in representation @xmath8 .",
    "any irreducible representation of @xmath0 is labeled by two integers , @xmath13 , which , in flavor language , count the number of quarks and antiquarks needed to construct the multiplet associated with @xmath14 .",
    "the basic building blocks of our effective actions are the group characters @xmath15 associated with the representation @xmath8 , that is the traces of the polyakov loop , @xmath16 note that these only depend on the traced polyakov loop in the fundamental representation , @xmath17 .",
    "the trivial character is of course @xmath18 while the first nontrivial ones correspond to the ( anti-)fundamental representations and yield just the standard traced polyakov loop ( and its complex conjugate ) , @xmath19 under a center transformation , the characters transform as @xmath20 center symmetry is then sufficient to determine the operator content of the effective action if we restrict to nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions . in terms of group characters one finds the general form @xmath21 = \\sum_{\\substack { { \\langle}{{\\bm{x } } } { { \\bm{y}}}{\\rangle } , \\ , pq ,    \\ , p'q ' \\\\ p + p ' = q + q ' \\bmod   3 } } \\lambda_{pq , p'q ' } \\ ,    \\chi_{pq } ( { \\mathcal{p}_{{{\\bm{x } } } } } ) \\ , \\chi_{p'q ' } ( { \\mathcal{p}_{{{\\bm{y } } } } } )   \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the sum over representations is constrained by center symmetry . expressing the characters explicitly in terms of the polyakov loop @xmath22 one",
    "easily recognizes as the action suggested by dumitru et al",
    "their ` potential terms ' , built from single center symmetric characters located at single sites appear whenever the second adjacent character is trivial , @xmath18 . in this case",
    "the typical hopping terms connecting nn sites ` degenerate ' into ultra - local terms , the one of lowest dimension being the ` octet loop ' contribution , @xmath23 as indeed @xmath24 .",
    "one expects that the couplings @xmath25 decrease with increasing representation labels , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , hence that representations of low dimension , @xmath30 dominate the effective action . to simplify our notation we will henceforth write the action ( and generalizations thereof ) as a series of the form @xmath31 where up to 16 different terms @xmath32 will be taken into consideration , albeit not necessarily within one and the same ansatz . a list of the operators @xmath32",
    "may be found in appendix [ app : sllist ] where we allow for next - to - nn ( nnn ) couplings in addition .",
    "it is easy to check that each of the terms given satisfies the selection rules for the representation labels necessary for center symmetry .",
    "it turns out ( in hindsight ) that the _ anstze _ or contain more freedom of choice than actually required which makes the inverse monte carlo routines less efficient ( see below ) . to further constrain this freedom we generalise to @xmath0 the strong - coupling approach introduced by billo et al .",
    "@xcite which we already have successfully applied to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the basic building blocks are then given by the center symmetric operators connecting nn sites , @xmath33 the strong coupling expansion then replaces the ansatz by the following somewhat more complicated expression @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 counts the number of link operators contributing at each order .",
    "the coefficients @xmath36 are the couplings between the operators @xmath37 from sitting at nn links @xmath38 in representation @xmath39 .",
    "the effective action defined in hence describes a network of link operators of the type that are collected into ( possibly disconnected ) ` polymers ' contributing with ` weight ' @xmath40 .",
    "again , one expects the ` weights ' or couplings to decrease as the dimensions of the representations and the inter - link distances involved increase . in a strong coupling",
    "( small-@xmath7 ) expansion truncated at @xmath41 one has @xmath42 and the additional restriction latexmath:[$|{\\mathcal{r}}_1| + \\cdots +    for a given representation @xmath8 .",
    "to lowest order @xmath44 one finds the universal effective action @xcite @xmath45 which is just a single hopping term connecting polyakov loops at nn sites .",
    "this is reminiscent of a generalised ising model or , more appropriately , a three - state potts model @xcite . as mentioned before the study of these models is interesting in its own right @xcite but will not be the topic of the present paper which focuses on the relation between the effective actions and yang - mills theory .    again , the most general representation is not too illuminating and we will therefore adopt the notation @xmath46 a list of the leading nn and nnn action terms @xmath47 can be found in appendix  [ app : sklist ] .    in principle , without any truncations , the effective actions and have to coincide although the operator bases used are different .",
    "accordingly , there is a linear relationship between the couplings @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "however , as the ordering principles for the two _ anstze _ are not the same the relation between the couplings _ after _ truncation is _ not _ one - to - one but rather of the form @xmath50 typically , for a given truncation of the @xmath51-action the range of the index @xmath52 is larger than that of @xmath53 , i.e.  there are more @xmath51 s than @xmath54 s .",
    "accordingly , the matrices @xmath55 are rectangular with @xmath56 and integer entries . for this reason it is calculationally often more efficient to work with the @xmath54-action and reobtain the @xmath48 via .",
    "our standard choices for the numerical matrices @xmath55 corresponding to different truncations of the effective actions may be found in appendix  [ app : lambda - kappa ] . as the operators @xmath32 appearing in",
    "are more intuitive and resemble generalised spin terms we have decided , for the sake of brevity , to present results only for the @xmath51 s in this paper .",
    "in this section we shortly recapitulate the @xmath0 schwinger - dyson equations ( sdes ) that have recently been derived in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". they will be the main tool to relate the effective actions and to yang - mills theory .",
    "our numerical approach benefits from the fact that there are two independent versions of sdes which in the end , however , should yield equivalent results .",
    "the first type of equations is based on an integral identity which is more algebraic in nature than the second type which follows from geometrical considerations .",
    "it is useful to parameterize the diagonalized , untraced polyakov loop by means of two angular variables , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 with values in a fundamental region given by the restrictions @xmath60 as a result , the reduced haar measure acquires the form @xmath61 with a nontrivial jacobian that may either be expressed in terms of characters , @xmath62 or in terms of the trace @xmath22 of , @xmath63 using the latter variable leads to the remarkable algebraic identity @xmath64 such that one can trade @xmath65 for its square root @xmath66 .",
    "it is a fact of life that any function @xmath67 vanishing on the boundary @xmath68 of a region @xmath69 satisfies the integral identity @xmath70 which is reminiscent of integration by parts on the real line , @xmath71 ( for functions @xmath72 vanishing at infinity ) . for our purposes we make the particular choice @xmath73 with arbitrary @xmath74 and integrate over the domain of @xmath22 given implicitly via",
    "this is consistent with the general identity as the reduced haar measure vanishes at the boundary @xmath75 of the fundamental region .",
    "hence , specializes to @xmath76 where we have used the reduced haar measure from and reinstated the dependence on the lattice site chosen to be @xmath77 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath65 can actually be worked out with the result @xmath78 to actually obtain genuine sdes we have to introduce the usual boltzmann factor @xmath79 .",
    "this is done by choosing a special function @xmath74 , namely @xmath80 with another function @xmath81 required to be @xmath82 invariant , @xmath83 plugging in the ansatz for the @xmath51-action the @xmath22-derivative of needed for becomes @xmath84 where the commas denote differentiation with respect to the subsequent argument .",
    "functional integration of with the measure @xmath85 finally yields the desired sdes , @xmath86 which comprise a linear system for the effective couplings @xmath48 , generalising analogous results for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the experience gained there prompts us to choose the function @xmath87 from the operators @xmath32 in the ansatz for the @xmath51-action .",
    "any index @xmath52 then yields an independent equation .",
    "in addition , this choice automatically satisfies the criterion of @xmath82 invariance .    on top of",
    "that we will vary the sites @xmath88 and @xmath77 , in particular the distance @xmath89 between them . on a lattice with spatial extent @xmath90",
    "this implies a range of distances @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the largest integer @xmath93 . for @xmath94 different operators @xmath32",
    "we thus obtain @xmath94 independent equations for each distance @xmath5 .      for any function @xmath95 on a lie group",
    "we define its left derivative in the direction of the generator @xmath96 via @xmath97 left invariance of the haar measure implies a symmetry relation somewhat analogous to , @xmath98 which will serve as a master identity generating all sdes . as in the previous subsection we would like to integrate over the reduced haar measure @xmath99 only .",
    "thus , we want the integrand @xmath100 to be a _ class _ function .",
    "if @xmath101 is such a class function it only depends on the fundamental group characters , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 denotes a fundamental representation of the group element @xmath104 , i.e.  @xmath105 or @xmath106 for @xmath0 . for the particular choice @xmath107 , with @xmath74 an arbitrary class function and @xmath108 a fundamental character , the integrand in indeed becomes a class function so that we end up with the ` reduced ' integral @xmath109 for @xmath0 we obviously choose the fundamental character @xmath108 as the trace of the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , slightly different from .",
    "the left derivatives are worked out as follows @xcite , @xmath112 + and only depend on the traced polyakov loop as they should . finally , to obtain feasible equations we choose @xmath87 among the @xmath22-derivatives of the @xmath32 , @xmath113 implying the following set of geometrical sdes ,    @xmath114    where , again , the dependence on the lattice site @xmath77 has been made explicit .",
    "we have seen that , for every pair of lattice sites @xmath12 and @xmath115 , we end up with a linear system of equations for the couplings of the effective theory .",
    "since on the lattice we have both translational and ( discrete ) rotational symmetry it is sufficient to consider different distances @xmath116 only .",
    "these serve as a label for our sets of equations which in a condensed matrix notation may be written as @xmath117 if we assume a total of @xmath94 unknown couplings collected into the vector @xmath118 we have , by construction of the sdes , an @xmath119 matrix @xmath120 and an inhomogeneity @xmath121 , hence an independent system of equations , for each distance @xmath5 .",
    "the off - diagonal entries of @xmath120 and the vector @xmath121 are typically complex but the couplings @xmath118 have to be real .",
    "we therefore distinguish between real and imaginary parts of for different @xmath5 and group them together into the equations @xmath122 this constitutes an overdetermined linear system of @xmath123 equations for the @xmath94 unknown couplings @xmath118 . in principle , this can be solved by standard least - square methods .",
    "however , this procedure is hampered by a few technical pitfalls . since the order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition",
    "is driven by the long - range behavior of the lattice system we have to take into account the fact that equations associated with different distances @xmath5 enter with different multiplicities . on a three - dimensional lattice",
    "this entails that an equation for distance @xmath124 has multiplicity @xmath125 while equations for @xmath126 only appear once . to account for this mismatch we reweight the coefficients of @xmath121 and @xmath120 ( for @xmath124 ) with a factor @xmath127 .",
    "another problem are the large condition numbers of the matrices . to cope with this we employ a simple form of normalization based on the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath128 . for the algebraic sdes the diagonal entries @xmath129 of @xmath128 dominate the linear system . for this reason",
    "we construct a new diagonal matrix @xmath130 from the @xmath129 according to @xmath131 by means of a similarity transformation with @xmath130 the real parts of the @xmath129 may be transformed to unity . as",
    "a result becomes @xmath132 typically , this new system of equations is better conditioned which increases the stability of the results .    in our numerical calculations",
    "we have both used the improvement in condition numbers and the reweighting factors given by the square root of .",
    "the imc method basically amounts to solving the sdes or , the crux being the evaluation of the expectation values @xmath133 in the _ microscopic _ ensemble . in our case",
    "this is given by a sufficient number of @xmath0 yang - mills configurations generated by standard mc routines @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will consider three _ anstze _ , one with five nn couplings and two more general ones which either contain nn terms in higher representations or additional nnn couplings . in a strong coupling expansion ( which is rationale for the @xmath54-actions ) both the five leading nn terms as well as the nnn ones",
    "would be of order @xmath134 while the extended nn ones would be @xmath135 .",
    "before one determines the effective couplings corresponding to yang - mills it is prudent to check if the sdes and derived above are consistent within the effective theories themselves . to test for that we have first simulated an effective theory with five fixed input couplings and tried to reproduce them via imc . in table",
    "[ tab : consistency1 ] we have listed the outcome of this testing procedure .",
    "one notes that the couplings @xmath136 determined via imc coincide with the chosen input couplings @xmath137 to an accuracy of about 2% , both for the algebraic and geometrical sdes .",
    "this tells us two things , first that our sdes and are both correct and , second , that imc works extremely well for the effective theories .",
    ".[tab : consistency1]imc consistency check for the nn @xmath51-action including five couplings @xmath138 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the new nn terms we will add are of strong - coupling order @xmath139 , the additional nnn terms of order @xmath134 .",
    "as we are working at large @xmath7 one can not predict which ones are going to be more important .",
    "rather , this will be one of the questions to be considered in what follows .    as before we have first tested the consistency of our sdes .",
    "table [ tab : consistency2 ] shows once again that even for a total of the order of ten couplings the method works well : imc output reproduces input for the effective theory .",
    "the empty input entries in table [ tab : consistency2 ] correspond to vanishing couplings .",
    "for a few sample couplings we have checked that vanishing input correctly entails vanishing output as well .    to determine the behavior of the effective couplings @xmath48 , @xmath140 , as a function of the wilson coupling @xmath7 we have used a set of @xmath141 configurations per @xmath7 on a @xmath142-lattice .",
    "this amounts to @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) uncorrelated configurations far away from ( close to ) the phase transition .",
    "the imc results are shown in figs.[fig : couplingsnn ] and [ fig : couplingsp ] displaying the effective couplings as functions of @xmath7 .",
    "again we note that the fundamental and octet potential couplings ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) dominate in size . more important from a principal point of view , however , is the observation that the behavior of coupling constants is very sensitive to the choice of operators .",
    "let us compare , for instance , the coupling @xmath147 in the two figs .",
    "[ fig : couplingsnn ] and [ fig : couplingsp ] . for the extended nn ansatz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : couplingsnn ] ) it is comparable in magnitude with @xmath145 and @xmath146 and behaves similarly as for the simple nn ansatz of fig .  [ fig : couplings4 ] .",
    "however , as soon as we include nnn operators its magnitude drops by 100% and its behavior changes drastically ( fig .",
    "[ fig : couplingsp ] ) .",
    "the latter is also true quite significantly for the octet coupling @xmath146 .",
    "this clearly signals an instability of the imc methods , at least as far as the determination of the couplings is concerned .",
    "behavior of the couplings @xmath148 ( appearing in the extended nn @xmath51-action ) as a function of the wilson coupling @xmath7 .",
    "( imc based on algebraic sdes . ) ]     behavior of the couplings @xmath149 ( appearing in the nn+nnn @xmath51-action ) as a function of the wilson coupling @xmath7 .",
    "( imc based on algebraic sdes . ) ]    nevertheless , it might still be possible that largely different sets of couplings lead to more or less identical behavior of observables . comparing the behavior of the polyakov loop in the effective and yang - mills theories rules out this possibility . as fig .",
    "[ fig : polnextorder ] shows the polyakov loop when calculated in the effective models is extremely sensitive to the choice of operators and the value of @xmath7 around @xmath150 . for both choices of sdes",
    "the effective order parameter significantly overshoots the yang - mills one in a small @xmath7-range near @xmath150 ( see the spikes in fig .",
    "[ fig : polnextorder ] ) .",
    "this means that in the space of effective couplings the phase boundary to the deconfined phase have slightly ( and for a short range of @xmath7 values ) been crossed albeit with drastic effect due to the discontinuous behavior of the polyakov loop .",
    "we conclude that the fine tuning problem encountered in the previous subsection indeed becomes more severe if we include more operators ( and hence increase the instabilities of the imc procedure ) .",
    "for the given number of effective couplings ( of order ten ) we have not been able to get this problem under control .",

    "in this paper we have applied the imc method to study the finite temperature phase transition of @xmath0 yang - mills theory . a crucial input were novel schwinger - dyson equations based on algebraic and geometrical properties of the @xmath0 haar measure .",
    "the resulting equations constitute overdetermined linear systems for the effective couplings @xmath48 which were solved numerically via least square techniques .",
    "the method works well if the number of couplings is sufficiently small , say of the order of five",
    ". however , already in this case one notes a fine - tuning problem as the behavior of the polyakov loop depends in a very sensitive and nonlinear way on the effective couplings .",
    "this fact can be traced back to the discontinuities associated with the first - order character of the phase transition .",
    "hence , the problem becomes more pronounced in larger volumes .",
    "if we increase the number of effective couplings and thus , inevitably , the instabilities in their imc determination , the fine - tuning problem again becomes more severe .",
    "this holds to such an extent that we could no longer gain numerical control and hence could no longer reproduce the yang - mills behavior of the polyakov loop in the vicinity of the critical wilson coupling , @xmath151 .",
    "we believe that an improvement on this situation will require nontrivial modifications of the imc procedure like e.g.smoothening of the loop in order to avoid the unphysical spikes of fig .",
    "[ fig : polnextorder ] .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to check whether creutz s microcanonical demon method @xcite mentioned in the introduction yields better results .",
    "we conclude , nevertheless , with the positive statement that the imc method does work for the first - order @xmath0 transition as well if we allow for only a small number of terms in the effective polyakov loop actions .",
