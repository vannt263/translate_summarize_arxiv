    "epsilon ursae majoris ( @xmath0 uma , hd  112185 , hr  4905 ) is the brightest ( @xmath9  =  1.77  mag ) chemically peculiar ( cp ) star and has been extensively studied during the last century .",
    "@xcite established a period of 5.@xmath100887 d from variations in the intensity of the ca  ii  k line and also noticed a periodic splitting of some lines .",
    "@xcite subsequently reported doubling of lines of cr  ii , fe  ii , v  ii and other elements at certain phases .",
    "since the overall widths of the double lines are the same and not all lines double , they ruled out the orbital motion and instead suggested that the phenomenon is related to rotation of the star .",
    "@xcite measured a double wave light variation with the same 5.@xmath100887 period .",
    "the star is brightest when the ca  ii  k line intensity is near its minimum and other elements are near their maximum strength .",
    "perhaps the most interesting and controversial aspect of @xmath0  uma is its the radial velocity variations .",
    "@xcite carried out the radial velocity analysis of the 62 brightest northern cp stars for spectroscopic binaries .",
    "they were used special observing and measuring techniques of the hydrogen lines and did not find the radial velocity variations for @xmath0  uma .",
    "not surprisingly , they could not to measure the radial velocity variations because the mean internal error per spectrum of 1.2  km  @xmath11 is near the limit at which the photographic technique is useful . on the other hand , @xcite detected the duplicity for the system @xmath0  uma with a separation of 0.053 arcsec , using speckle interferometry technique .",
    "although , the authors noted that the observed separation corresponds to the diffraction limit of the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope .",
    "@xcite measured the radial velocity variations of many lines in the star and found sinusoidal variations in the radial velocities of fe , cr and ti lines with amplitudes of about 20  km  @xmath11 and attributed this to the existence of a spots of enhanced abundance of these elements .",
    "several surface abundance doppler images of @xmath0  uma have been produced @xcite .",
    "most of the published doppler images relate to fe , o , ca , or cr abundance .",
    "recently , @xcite determined for @xmath0  uma for the first time the abundance distributions of mn , ti , sr , and mg .",
    "attempt to determine orbital motion using these spectral lines would be impossible .",
    "however , the hydrogen lines do not show significant rotational effect in their radial velocity .",
    "they would be preferable for the measurement of binary motion if the radial velocity of the hydrogen lines could be measured with precision .    in this letter , we present the radial velocity measurement of the hydrogen lines in the spectrum of cp star @xmath0  uma .",
    "the elodie observations of this star and data reduction are described in sect .  2 .",
    "the orbital solution derived for the satellite candidate are presented in sect .",
    "section 4 reports discussion of our results for @xmath0  uma and conclusions are presented in sect .",

    "the sharp cores of the hydrogen lines are not affected by spectral lines and the flux is formed in the upper layers of the atmosphere . thus our technique was to use only the sharp cores of the hydrogen lines in spectra of @xmath0  uma .",

    "the program allows detecting the variations of the centre gravity of the sharp cores of the hydrogen lines .",

    "the orbital solution of table  2 was obtained by fitting a keplerian orbit to the 29 elodie radial velocity measurements .",
    "note that most of observations were obtained between jd=2451568 ( january 2000 ) and jd=2451714 ( june 2000 ) ( see table  1 ) .",

    "the radial velocity curve is displayed in fig .  2 with the residuals around solution .",
    "a linear trend is not observed in the residuals around the orbital solution that can be explained by the absent of a second companion in a longer - period orbit .",
    "although , the weighted r.m.s . around the best keplerian solution ( @xmath28(o - c ) ) is equal to 0.131  km  @xmath11 .",

    "the presence of the spots on the stellar surface of @xmath0  uma can change the observed spectral line profiles and induces a periodic radial velocity signal similar to the one expected from the presence of a satellite .",
    "the hydrogen lines analysis is one of the best tools to discriminate between radial velocity variations due to changes in the spectral line shapes and variations due to the real orbital motion of the star .",
    "it is obviously of interest to compare the phase diagram of the radial velocity of @xmath0  uma derived above with the phase diagram of the radial velocity computed from metallic lines . in this way , we selected the spectral region of the very prominent unblended cr  ii line at @xmath18  4558   .",

    "the maximum splitting of this line is at phase 0.04 .",
    "the splitting of the lines was first observed by @xcite in the spectrum of @xmath0  uma .",
    "however , the authors concluded that the doubling is not caused by orbital motion but may be due to a combination of the physical effects with doppler effect in a rotating star .",
    "@xcite estimated the masses for 10 magnetic cp stars using the position of stars in the log@xmath31  ",
    "log@xmath32 plane .",
    "position of @xmath0  uma in the log@xmath31  ",

    "the effective temperature of @xmath0  uma was taken from the paper by @xcite and is equal to 9340@xmath34530  k. on the hypothesis that the rotational axis of @xmath0  uma is perpendicular to the orbital plane we can estimate the mass of the secondary star",
    ". for the value of @xmath39  =  3.0@xmath35 and @xmath21  =  @xmath37 eq.(3 ) gives @xmath40  =  0.014@xmath35 .",
    "this result gives a value @xmath314.7@xmath4 , strongly suggesting that the companion is in the typical brown - dwarf regime .",
    "if we know the value @xmath39/@xmath40 then it is possible to estimate the projected semi - amplitude variation of the radial velocity for the companion according to formula : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the projected semi - amplitude variation of the radial velocity for @xmath0  uma taken from table  2 . for the value of @xmath43  =  0.634  km  @xmath6 eq.(4 )",
    "gives @xmath5  =  135.9  km  @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we can estimate the sine of inclination times semi - major axis using eq.(2 ) .",
    "computation gives the value of @xmath7@xmath8(i )  =  0.055  au .",
    "these estimates show that the proposed brown - dwarf is quite close to the surface of @xmath0  uma at periastron .",
    "but , such close orbits are not new .",
    "for example , the subgiant star hd  118203 have the planet with eccentric orbit ( @xmath2  =  0.31 ) , the period of @xmath1  =  6.1335  d , and is close to its parent star ( @xmath44  =  0.06  au ) @xcite .",
    "another way to interpret the radial velocity variations is the radial pulsation of @xmath0  uma .",
    "@xcite are analysed observations of @xmath0  uma obtained with the star tracker on the _ wide field infrared explorer _ satellite .",
    "the authors observed that a light curve has about 2 per cent amplitude of photometric variability .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite has presented ultraviolet light curves for @xmath0  uma from the oao-2 satellite which indicate that the photometric variations of this star are due to variable ultraviolet absorption effects which redistribute flux into the visible region ( see his fig .",
    "note that no colour index changes @xcite .",
    "certainly the radial pulsation appears unlikely given that the rotational period is synchronized with the orbital period of @xmath0  uma .",
    "the archival elodie high - resolution echelle spectra of @xmath0  uma permit us to analyse the radial velocity variations of the sharp cores of the hydrogen lines .",
    "this allowed determining the orbital elements of binary system for the cp star @xmath0  uma .",
    "the best keplerian fit to the data shown that the rotational period is synchronized with the orbital period .",
    "we are estimated the mass of the secondary star which is equal @xmath314.7@xmath4 .",
    "this result indicate that the companion is the brown - dwarf with the projected semi - amplitude variation of the radial velocity @xmath5  =  135.9  km  @xmath6 and the sine of inclination times semi - major axis @xmath7@xmath8(i )  =  0.055  au .",
