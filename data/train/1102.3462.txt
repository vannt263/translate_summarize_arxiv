    "it is well known that the partition function of a potts model with @xmath0 spin states on a graph @xmath1 is given by the value at @xmath0 of the multivariate tutte polynomial of the graph , a famous combinatorial invariant of graphs .",
    "the problem of phase transitions in potts models is related to the behavior of the sets of complex zeros and real zeros of these polynomials , see for instance @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new approach , based on algebraic geometry , and especially on motivic invariants such as classes in the grothendieck ring of varieties , to study how the set of zeros of the partition function of a potts model changes for a nested family of finite graphs that grow in size to approximate an infinite graph .",
    "we aim at estimating the  topological complexity \" of the set of real zeros by computing its euler characteristic with compact support , which is also known to provide an estimate of the algorithmic complexity of the real algebraic set . in order to compute this invariant and",
    "estimate its growth over certain explicit families of graphs , we use the fact that the invariant is not just topological but also  motivic \" , which means that it defines a ring homomorphism from the grothendieck ring of varieties to the integers .    thus , we proceed first to compute explicitly the classes in the grothendieck ring of the varieties defined by the zeros of the potts models partition functions , following techniques recently developed to treat a similar problem arising in perturbative quantum field theory , for algebraic varieties associated to the parametric form of feynman integrals .",
    "the varieties arising in quantum field theory can be viewed , up to a duality , as a limit case of the ones arising from the potts model partition functions .",
    "we first prove an algebro - geometric inclusion - exclusion formula that relates the classes for a given graph to those of the graphs obtained by deleting or contracting one edge in the graph , and a more complicated algebro  geometric term , which is the variety defined by the intersection of the varieties of the deletion and the contraction .",
    "this formula is similar to an analogous result proved in @xcite for the varieties arising from feynman diagrams in quantum field theory .",
    "we then show that , when iterating simple operations on graphs , such as splitting an edge or doubling an edge , the more complicated term in the algebro  geometric deletion contraction formula can be simplified due to cancellations in the grothendieck ring and the resulting operation can be described completely in terms of varieties associated to purely combinatorial data on the graph .",
    "the corresponding recursive relation leads to explicit and remarkably simple generating functions for the classes of graphs obtained from a given graph by multiple edge splittings or edge doublings .",
    "we use the formulae obtained in this way to write explicitly the classes in the grothendieck ring for the loci of zeros of the partition function on potts models over graphs given by chains of linked polygons .",
    "this class of potts models was already studied by different techniques in the literature ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "similarly , we compute the grothendieck classes explicitly for similar chains where the polygons are replaced by their dual graphs , the banana graphs .    for these illustrative examples",
    ", we then use the expression for the grothendieck class to compute explicitly the euler characteristic with compact support , and we show that it grows exponentially as the graphs grow in size , thus estimating the corresponding growth in complexity of the set of real zeros of the partition function .",
    "we recall some basic facts and terminology about potts model that we need in the rest of the paper . for a more detailed introduction to partition functions of potts models and",
    "their relation to graph combinatorics , we refer the reader to @xcite , see also the survey @xcite .",
    "the multivariate tutte polynomial of a finite graph @xmath1 is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of vertices of @xmath1 and @xmath3 the set of edges .",
    "we do not assume @xmath1 to be connected .",
    "one assigns to each edge @xmath4 a variable @xmath5 and then considers the polynomial @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of connected components , and the sum is over all subgraphs @xmath8 that have the same number of vertices @xmath9 of @xmath1 .",
    "each subgraph @xmath10 therefore corresponds to a choice of a subset @xmath11 of edges of @xmath1 , so that @xmath12 .",
    "the variables @xmath5 and the additional variable @xmath0 are commuting variables .    a detailed account of the relation between the multivariate tutte polynomial and the physics of potts models is given in the survey @xcite . to briefly recall the main point , in the case where @xmath0 is a positive integer ,",
    "one considers a @xmath0-state model on a graph @xmath1 , where each vertex carries a  spin \" that can take @xmath0 possible values ( the case @xmath13 recovers the usual @xmath14 states of spin ) .",
    "we let @xmath15 be the set of cardinality @xmath0 of the possible spin states .",
    "a state of the system is an assignment of a spin state to each vertex and the energy @xmath16 of a state is the sum over all edges of the graph of a quantity that is equal to zero if the spins assigned to the two endpoints of the edge are different and equal to an assigned value @xmath17 if they are the same . with the notation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the thermodynamic parameter ( an inverse temperature up to the boltzmann constant )",
    ", one has @xmath20 in the ferromagnetic case ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 in the antiferromagnetic case @xmath23 .",
    "the partition function of the system is then the sum over all the possible states of the corresponding boltzmann weight @xmath24 , with @xmath16 the energy of that state .",

    ", the multivariate tutte polynomial satisfies a deletion  contraction relation .",
    "namely , given an edge @xmath30 , let @xmath31 be the graph obtained by deleting the edge @xmath32 and let @xmath33 be the graph obtained by contracting it .",

    "zeros of the multivariate tutte polynomial are of special interest in relation to the problem of phase transitions of the statistical mechanical system described by the potts model .",
    "in fact , the partition function @xmath36 becomes the normalization factor of the probability distribution on the set of all possible states of the system , and zeros of @xmath36 would signal the presence of a phase transition in the system , for a specific choice of parameters @xmath37 and @xmath0 , and for certain values of the inverse temperature @xmath19 .    in the ferromagnetic case , the physical case of interest",
    "is where the variables @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , the polynomial @xmath36 does not have zeros in that domain .",
    "the antiferromagnetic case with @xmath22 is more interesting , and various results on zero - free regions are given in @xcite .",
    "even when there are no zeros in the region of direct physical interest , it is well known ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that studying the _ complex _ zeros of the polynomials @xmath36 can provide useful information on phase transitions , not for a single graph @xmath1 itself , but for a family of finite graphs @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 determines an infinite graph on which one still considers a statistical mechanical system obtained as a thermodynamic limit of the finite systems .",
    "if loci of complex zeros of the @xmath36 can approach the real locus in the limit , this will result in the presence of phase transitions for the system on @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the geometric problem we concentrate on is to understand and estimate how the loci of complex and real zeros , respectively , of the potts model partition function change over certain families of finite graphs @xmath43 as above .",
    "our point of view , in this paper , is to approach this problem from an algebro  geometric and motivic point of view , inspired by recent developments on motivic properties of the loci of zeros of the closely related kirchhoff graph polynomials in the setting of perturbative quantum field theory , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "studying the zeros of the polynomial @xmath36 , means understanding the geometry of the hypersurface defined by the equation @xmath44 .",
    "since the polynomial is not homogeneous in its variables , it does not define a projective hypersurface ( unlike the case of the graph polynomials in quantum field theory ) , but it does define an affine hypersurface , which we refer to as _ the potts model hypersurface_. in fact , we consider two types of hypersurfaces associated to the potts model , one where the parameter @xmath0 is treated as a variable @xmath45 along with the other edge variables @xmath5 , and one where one specializes to a fixed value of @xmath0 .

    "we distinguish here between virtual phase transitions ( all real zeros of the polynomial @xmath36 ) and the actual physical phase transitions , which would be constrained by the additional requirement that @xmath57 and the edge variables are @xmath20 in the ferromagnetic case , or @xmath58 in the antiferromagnetic case .",

    "therefore , all contributions of forests to @xmath36 have degree equal to the number of vertices of @xmath1 , and this is the lowest possible degree .    thus , the polynomial @xmath110 collects the contribution of those terms of @xmath36 corresponding to subgraphs that are forests with @xmath9 ( spanning forests ) , @xmath119 the hypersurface @xmath108 is the locus of zeros of the polynomial @xmath120 satisfying @xmath121 , where @xmath0 does not divide @xmath120 .",

    "these invariants are sometimes called _",
    "motivic_.    in particular , in the case of complex algebraic varieties and of classes in @xmath133 , among these motivic invariants that factor through the grothendieck ring we have the usual topological euler characteristic , but also the virtual hodge polynomials .",
    "these will be useful to us in the following so we recall briefly the definition .    the virtual hodge polynomial of an algebraic variety is defined as @xmath134 where , for each pair of integers @xmath135 , the term @xmath136 is the hodge number of the mixed hodge structure on the cohomology with compact support of @xmath85 .",

    "as we mentioned above , in the case of complex algebraic varieties , the ordinary topological euler characteristic is a motivic invariant .",
    "this is not true for real algebraic varieties , as the additive property over closed embeddings need not be satisfied .",

    "there is then no obvious recursive procedure of the type used for either the splitting or the doubling alone , which takes care of eliminating both of these additional terms .",
    "this remains an interesting case of graphs to investigate .",
    "we show here , in the concrete example of the chains of linked polygon graphs @xmath539 and in the simpler example of the banana graphs , how one can use our calculations of classes in the grothendieck ring to estimate how the topological complexity of the set of virtual phase transition grows as the graphs grow in size within the given family .",
    "good indicators of topological complexity are homologies and cohomologies and the associated euler characteristics . in the case of the real algebraic varieties",

    "[ chicsec ] , this is the unique invariant of real algebraic varieties that is both a topological invariant and a motivic invariant . using the fact that it factors through the grothendieck ring @xmath155 , we obtain the following results .",
    "[ chiczgmknqprop ] let @xmath539 be the chain of linked polygons graphs of definition [ gmkn ] .",
    "then the euler characteristic with compact support @xmath627 of the set of virtual phase transitions @xmath628 of the potts model is given by @xmath629    as we have seen in example [ chiclt ] , for real varieties @xmath630 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath631 is a ring homomorphism @xmath632 we then obtain from of proposition [ classgmknq ] , @xmath633 we then use additivity again to obtain @xmath634 where @xmath635 and @xmath636 , so that we obtain .

    "then the euler characteristic with compact support @xmath637 of the set of virtual phase transitions in the model is given by @xmath638        there is , in fact , a more technical sense , from the point of view of complexity theory , according to which the euler characteristic @xmath626 really gives an estimate of the complexity of the real algebraic variety @xmath56 of virtual phase transitions of the potts model over the graph @xmath1 .",
