    "as explained in detail elsewhere in this review , a precise measurement of the lifetimes of the various weakly decaying charm and beauty hadrons possesses great experimental value per se as well as in searches for @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations .",
    "yet there exists also a strong theoretical interest in determining and interpreting those lifetimes ; i want to sketch that first in rather qualitative terms and give specifics later .",
    "weak decays of hadrons depend on fundamental parameters of the standard model , in particular on the km parameters and quark masses .",
    "it is eminently important to reliably determine their values from data .",
    "alas  this is easier said than done theoretically ( and experimentally ) ! for in such an endeavour we have to face the `` dichotomy of the two worlds '' . on the one hand",
    "there is the `` theorists world '' where quarks and gluons are the relevant strongly interacting entities ; it is in this short - distance or femto world where theorists like to formulate their fundamental theories . on the other hand",
    "there is the `` real world '' where hadrons constitute the relevant degrees of freedom ; it is in that world where everyone ( including theorists ) lives and measurements are performed . to formulate predictions from the theorists world in the language of the real world and to translate findings from the real world back into the idioms of the theorists world",
    "represents the theoretical challenge one faces .",
    "one quantitative measure for the difference between the two worlds is provided by the lifetimes of the weakly decaying hadrons carrying the same flavour . on the quark level",
    "there is obviously only a single lifetime for a given flavour . yet in the ` real world ' hadrons carrying the same flavour quantum number possess different ( and even vastly different ) lifetimes ; e.g. , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . on",
    "the other hand deviations of the lifetime ratios from unity evidently decrease for an increasing heavy - flavour mass .",
    "this is as expected in a simple ` two - component ' picture : in the limit of @xmath5  the mass of the heavy - flavour quark @xmath6  going to infinity the ` spectator ansatz ' should hold where the lifetimes of all hadrons @xmath7 containing @xmath6 coincide ; for finite values of @xmath5 there are _ pre - asymptotic _ corrections .",
    "two lines of reasoning support this qualitative picture :    ( @xmath8 ) the decay width of a quark @xmath6 increases very quickly with its mass @xmath5 : @xmath9 for @xmath10 changing into @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "( rather than @xmath13 ) reflects the coupling of the _ longitudinal _ @xmath14 boson  the original higgs field  to the top quark .",
    "] therefore for @xmath5 sufficiently large , its decay width is bound to exceed @xmath15 , i.e. the quark @xmath6 decays before it can hadronize .",
    "gev @xcite . ]",
    "then there is obviously a universal lifetime for such a heavy flavour and the spectator ansatz applies trivially .",
    "( @xmath16 ) analysing all _ non_-spectator reactions explicitely , one finds their widths to increase with a smaller power of @xmath5 than the spectator process ; thus one arrives at the spectator ansatz as the asymptotic case .",
    "the most relevant phenomenological question then is how quickly the limit of universal lifetimes is approached .",
    "some mechanisms had been identified very early on that generate differences in the lifetimes of hadrons @xmath7 with the same heavy flavour @xmath6 : `` weak annihilation '' ( = wa ) of @xmath6 with the light valence antiquark for mesons or `` w scattering '' ( = ws ) with the valence diquark system for baryons . such an analysis had first been undertaken for charm decays .",
    "since wa contributes to cabibbo allowed decays of @xmath17 , but not of @xmath18 mesons ( in the valence quark description ) , it creates a difference in @xmath19 vs. @xmath20 .",
    "however the wa rate is doubly suppressed relative to the spectator rate , namely by the helicity factor @xmath21 with @xmath22 denoting the largest mass in the final state and by the ` wavefunction overlap ' factor @xmath23 reflecting the practically zero range of the low - energy weak interactions : @xmath24 therefore it had originally been suggested that already charm hadrons should possess approximately equal lifetimes .",
    "it then came as quite a surprise when observations showed it to be otherwise  in particular since the first data suggested a considerably larger value for @xmath25 than measured today .",
    "this near - shock caused a re - appraisal of the theoretical situation ; its results at that time can be summarized in four main points :    \\(i ) one source for a lifetime difference had too quickly been discarded as insignificant .",
    "cabibbo - allowed nonleptonic decays of @xmath18  but not of @xmath17  mesons produce two antiquarks in the final state that carry the same flavour : @xmath26 { \\rightarrow}(s\\bar d u ) \\bar d\\ ] ] thus one has to allow for the _ interference _ between different quark diagrams in @xmath18 , yet not in @xmath17 decays ; the @xmath27 valence antiquark in @xmath18 mesons thus ceases to play the role of an uninvolved bystander and a difference in the @xmath18 vs. @xmath17 lifetimes will arise .",
    "while this interference had been included in descriptions of the @xmath28 two - body modes it was ignored for total widths . for it was thought ( often without stating it explicitely ) that the required coherence would not be maintained between the two amplitudes when applied to inclusive transitions .",
    "this assumption was challenged in ref.@xcite where it was argued that even the two inclusive amplitudes remain sufficiently coherent .",
    "the interference turns out to be destructive , i.e. it prolongs @xmath20 over @xmath19 , but only once the qcd radiative corrections have been included .",
    "this effect is usually referred to as ` pauli interference ' ( = pi ) although such a name would be misleading if it is interpreted as suggesting that the interference is automatically destructive .",
    "\\(ii ) it was argued @xcite that the helicity suppression of the wa contribution to @xmath29 decays can be vitiated .",
    "the diagram in fig.1 contains gluon bremsstrahlung off the initial antiquark line in the @xmath14-exchange reaction ; evaluating this particular diagram explicitely one finds : @xmath30 with @xmath31 denoting the average energy of the initial antiquark @xmath32 .",
    "term in the amplitude derives from the propagator in the diagram . ]",
    "using a non - relativistic wavefunction for the decaying meson one has @xmath33 .",
    "this contribution , although of higher order in @xmath34 , would dominate over the lowest order term @xmath35 since helicity suppression has apparently been vitiated and the decay constant @xmath36 is now calibrated by @xmath31 with @xmath37 rather than @xmath38 .",
    "the spectator picture would still apply at asymptotic quark masses , since @xmath39 as @xmath40 due to @xmath41 . yet",
    "if eq.(3 ) were indeed to hold , it would have a dramatic impact on the theoretical description of weak heavy - flavour decays : the impact of this particular pre - asymptotic correction , namely wa , would be enhanced considerably and actually be quite significant even in beauty decays .",
    "alternatively it had been suggested @xcite that the wavefunction of the @xmath29 meson contains a @xmath42 component where the @xmath43 pair forms a spin - one configuration with the gluon @xmath44 balancing the spin of the @xmath45 pair .",
    "both effects , namely pi and wa , work in the same direction , i.e. both enhance @xmath20 over @xmath19 .",
    "\\(iii ) a rich structure emerges in the decays of charm baryons @xcite :    @xmath46 on the one hand ws contributes to the cabibbo allowed @xmath47 and @xmath48 decays ; one should also keep in mind that ws is _ not _ helicity suppressed in baryon decays already to lowest order in the strong coupling .",
    "it is still reduced in size by the corresponding wavefunction overlap ; yet that is at least partially off - set by ws being described by two - body phasespace versus the three - body phase space of the spectator transition ; this relative enhancement in phase space can be estimated to be roughly of order @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath46 pi affects the @xmath47 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 widths in various ways , generating destructive as well as constructive contributions !",
    "this also strongly suggests that it is very hard to make reliable numerical predictions for these baryonic lifetimes ; yet the overall qualitative pattern has been predicted : @xmath52 together with @xmath53    \\(iv ) pre - asymptotic corrections might be sizeable in the lifetime ratios of beauty hadrons .",
    "reviews of these phenomenological descriptions can be found in @xcite .",
    "it turned out , as discussed in more detail later on , that some of the phenomenological descriptions anticipated the correct results : it is pi that provides the main engine behind the @xmath18-@xmath17 lifetime ratio ; @xmath47 is considerably shorter - lived than @xmath17 ; the observed charm baryon lifetimes do obey the hierarchy stated in eq.(4 ) .",
    "nevertheless the phenomenological treatments had significant shortcomings , both of a theoretical and of a phenomenological nature : ( i ) no agreement had emerged in the literature about how corrections in particular due to wa and ws scale with the heavy quark mass @xmath5 .",
    "( ii ) accordingly no clear predictions could be made on the lifetime ratios among beauty hadrons , namely whether @xmath54 and @xmath55 differ by a few to several percent only , or by 20 - 30 % , or by even more !",
    "( iii ) no unequivocal prediction on @xmath56 or @xmath57 had appeared .",
    "( iv ) in the absence of a systematic treatment it is easy to overlook relevant contributions , and that is actually what happened ; or the absence of certain corrections had to be postulated in an ad - hoc fashion",
    ". thus there existed an intellectual as well as practical need for a description based on a systematic theoretical framework rather than a set of phenomenological prescriptions .      in the last few years",
    "we have succeeded in showing that the non - perturbative corrections to heavy - flavour decays can be expressed through a _",
    "systematic _ expansion in _ inverse _ powers of @xmath5 .",
    "a simple analogy with nuclear @xmath16 decay can illustrate this point .",
    "there are two effects distinguishing the decays of neutrons bound in a nucleus from the decay of free neutrons :    \\(a ) nuclear binding effects ;    \\(b ) the impact of pauli statistics correlating the electrons surrounding the nucleus with those emerging from @xmath16 decay .",
    "the typical energies of the bound electrons ",
    "@xmath58  are certainly small compared to @xmath59 , the energy released in the decay ; let us assume ",
    "although this is not true in reality  that also the nuclear binding energies @xmath60 were small compared to @xmath59 .",
    "in that case nuclear @xmath16 decays would proceed , to a good approximation , like the decays of _ free _ neutrons ; corrections to this simple ` spectator ' picture could be computed via an expansion in powers of @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in practice ,",
    "however , the corrections for nuclear @xmath16 decay are incorporated by explicitely using the wave functions of the bound nucleons and electrons ( obtained with the help of some fairly massive computer codes ) .",
    "there arise analogous corrections to the decay rate for a quark @xmath6 inside a hadron @xmath7 :    \\(a ) interactions of the decaying quark with other partons in the hadron ; this includes wa of @xmath6 with the light valence antiquark for mesons or ws with the valence diquark system for baryons ; they correspond to k capture of bound electrons by a heavy nucleus in the preceding example .",
    "\\(b ) pi effects of the decay products with other partons in the hadron ; e.g. : @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "they prolong the lifetimes of @xmath18 and @xmath65 mesons .",
    "the difference to the example of nuclear @xmath16 decay is quite obvious : even in the limit @xmath66 a non - relativistic bound - state treatment is inapplicable since the dynamical degrees of freedom of the heavy - flavour hadron @xmath7 can not fully be described by a hadronic wavefunction .",
    "the most reliable approach is then to evaluate weak decay rates of heavy - flavour hadrons through an expansion in powers of @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents a hadronic scale @xmath69 1 gev .",
    "the first few terms in this series should yield a good approximation for beauty decays ; the situation for charm decays is a priori unclear ( and at present remains so a posteriori as well ) ; this will be discussed in detail later on .",
    "the vice of hadronization is then transformed into ( almost ) a virtue : the weak decays of heavy - flavour hadrons constitute an intriguing and novel laboratory for studying strong dynamics through their interplay with the weak forces  and this is the secondary motivation for studying them . to be more specific : the heavy - flavour mass @xmath5 provides an expansion parameter that allows to deal with the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd in a novel way .",
    "the formalism to be employed combines the @xmath70 expansion with other elements derived from qcd proper without having to invoke a ` deus ex machina '  in contrast to phenomenological descriptions .",
    "there is one concept underlying , in one form or another , all efforts to deal with hadronization , namely the notion of quark - hadron duality ( henceforth referred to as _ duality _ for short ) . in its broadest formulation",
    "it can be stated as follows : sufficiently inclusive transition rates between hadronic systems can be calculated in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "while the general validity of this concept has not been established in a rigorous fashion , new light has been shed on its nature , validity and applicability by @xmath70 expansions .",
    "lifetimes obviously represent the most inclusive quantity where duality should be applicable .",
    "nonleptonic transitions are certainly more complex than semileptonic ones ; yet i will argue later that while there probably exists a quantitative difference in the degree to which duality holds in semileptonic and in nonleptonic decays , there is _ no qualitative _ one .",
    "deatiled measurements of lifetimes are then theoretically important not only to translate data on the semileptonic branching ratio into a determination of the semileptonic width , but also in their own right",
    ".    dedicated and comprehensive studies of both charm and beauty decays are called for .",
    "the km parameters relevant for charm decays  @xmath71 and @xmath72  are well known through unitarity constraints of the 3x3 km matrix , in contrast to the situation in beauty decays , and i consider it unlikely that charm decay studies can improve on that . on the other hand those can be used to calibrate our theoretical tools before applying them to beauty decays .    before concluding this general introduction i want to point out a less straightforward aspect of accurate lifetime measurements : decay rate evolutions in proper time for neutral mesons will not follow a single exponential function when particle - antiparticle oscillations occur .",
    "for there exist two distinct mass eigenstates with @xmath73 .",
    "the quantity @xmath74 generates a deviation of the form @xmath75 or @xmath76 ; @xmath77 leads to the emergence of a second exponential .",
    "the general expression reads as follows : @xmath78{\\rightarrow}f)/dt \\ ; \\propto e^{-\\gamma t}\\cdot g(t)\\ ] ] @xmath79 where @xmath80 \\right]\\ ] ] @xmath81 - re [ \\frac{q}{p}\\bar \\rho ( f ) ] \\right]\\ ] ] @xmath82 \\ ; , \\ ; \\bar \\rho ( f)= \\frac{\\bar a(f)}{a(f ) } \\eqno(5b)\\ ] ] with @xmath83 and @xmath84 denoting the amplitude for @xmath85 { \\rightarrow}f$ ] and @xmath86 { \\rightarrow}f$ ] , respectively .",
    "in this section i summarize the numerical results and sketch the main elements of the underlying theoretical treatment in a way that can satisfy the casual reader .",
    "a more in - depth discussion of the theoretical concepts and tools will be presented in subsequent sections .",
    "expanding the width for the decay of a heavy - flavour hadron @xmath7 containing @xmath6 into an inclusive final state @xmath87 through order @xmath88 one obtains @xcite @xmath89 @xmath90 ,   \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] where the dimensionless coefficients @xmath91 depend on the parton level characteristics of @xmath87 ( such as the ratios of the final - state quark masses to @xmath5 ) ; @xmath92 denotes the appropriate combination of km parameters , and @xmath93 with @xmath94 being the gluonic field strength tensor . the last term in eq.(6 )",
    "implies also the summation over the four - fermion operators with different light flavours @xmath95 .",
    "the expectation values of the local operators appearing on the right - hand side of eq.(6 ) contain the relativistic normalization of the state @xmath96 : @xmath97    it is through the quantities @xmath98 that the dependence on the _ decaying hadron _",
    "@xmath7 , and on non - perturbative forces in general , enters , instead of through wavefunctions as in nuclear @xmath16 decay .",
    "since these are matrix elements for on - shell hadrons @xmath7 , one sees that @xmath99 is indeed expanded into a power series in @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath66 the contribution from the lowest dimensional operator obviously dominates ; here it is the dimension three operator @xmath101 . a heavy quark expansion yields : @xmath102 i.e. @xmath103 for @xmath66 , reflecting the unit of heavy - flavour common to all hadrons @xmath7 .",
    "eqs.(6,8 ) show that the leading nonperturbative corrections are of order @xmath104 rather than @xmath70 ; therefore they can be expected to be rather small in beauty decays .",
    "the expectation values appearing in the @xmath104 and @xmath88 contributions can be related to other observables and their size thus be extracted in a reliable manner . applying the master formula eq.(6 ) to lifetimes one arrives at the following general results :    @xmath46 the leading contribution to the total decay width is given by the first term on the right - hand - side of eq.(8 ) that is _ common _ to all hadrons of a given heavy - flavour quantum number . for @xmath66 one",
    "has thus derived  from qcd proper  the spectator picture attributing equal lifetimes to all hadrons of a given heavy - flavour ! this is not a surprising result ",
    "after all without hadronization there is of course only a unique lifetime  , but it is gratifying nevertheless .",
    "@xmath46 lifetime differences first arise at order @xmath104 and are controlled by the expectation values of two dimension five operators , to be discussed later .",
    "these terms , which had been overlooked in the original phenomenological analyses , generate a lifetime difference between heavy - flavour _ baryons _ on one side and _ mesons _ on the other .",
    "yet apart from small isospin or @xmath105 breaking they shift the meson widths by the same amount and thus do _ not _ lead to differences among the meson lifetimes .",
    "@xmath46 those emerge at order @xmath88 and are expressed through the expectation values of four - fermion operators which are proportional to @xmath106 with @xmath107 denoting the decay constant for the meson @xmath108 .",
    "contributions from what is referred to as wa and pi in the original phenomenological descriptions ( see the discussion in sect.1 ) are systematically and consistently included .",
    "further contributions to the baryon - meson lifetime difference also arise at this level due to ws .",
    "@xmath46 since the transitions @xmath109 or @xmath110 are described by an isosinglet operator one can invoke the isospin invariance of the strong interactions to deduce for the semileptonic widths @xmath111 @xmath112 and therefore @xmath113 @xmath114 up to small corrections due to the km [ cabibbo ] suppressed transition @xmath115 [ @xmath116 which changes isospin by half a unit .",
    "the spectator picture goes well beyond eqs.(9 ) : it assigns the same semileptonic width to all hadrons of a given heavy flavour .",
    "yet such a property can not be deduced on _ general _ grounds : for one had to rely on @xmath117 symmetry to relate @xmath118 to @xmath119 or @xmath120 to @xmath121 and no symmetry can be invoked to relate the semileptonic widths of mesons and baryons .",
    "there is actually a wa process that generates semileptonic decays on the cabibbo - allowed level for @xmath122 [ and also for @xmath123 , but not for @xmath17 and @xmath18 nor for @xmath124 , @xmath65 and @xmath125 mesons : the hadrons are produced by gluon emission off the @xmath126 [ or the @xmath127 line . yet since the relative weight of wa is significantly reduced in meson decays , one does not expect this mechanism to change @xmath118 significantly relative to @xmath119 .",

    "the overall agreement is rather good given the theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",

    "some comments should be made at this point :    \\(i ) as stated before , the early phenomenological treatments had already identified the relevant mechanisms by which lifetime differences arise , namely pi , wa and ws . furthermore the authors of ref.@xcite had argued ",
    "correctly  that pi constitutes the dominant effect .",
    "yet it is the heavy quark expansion that provides a firm theoretical underpinning to these expectations .",
    "in particular it clarifies  both conceptually and quantitatively  the role of wa and how its weight scales with @xmath70 .",

    "the heavy quark expansion shows unequivocally that they are absent in total rates ; this has important ramifications , to be pointed out later .",
    "\\(iii ) corrections of order @xmath104 differentiate between the decays of mesons and of baryons .",
    "they had been overlooked before .",
    "the heavy quark expansion has identified them and basically determined their size .",
    "the weak decay of the heavy quark @xmath6 inside the heavy - flavour hadron @xmath7 proceeds within a cloud of light degrees of freedom ( quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) with which @xmath6 and its decay products can interact strongly .",
    "it is the challenge for theorists to treat these initial and final state hadronization effects . among the existing four post - voodoo theoretical technologies ",
    "qcd sum rules , lattice qcd , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and heavy quark expansions  only the last one deals with inclusive decays . on the other hand it benefits , as we will see , from the results of the other three technologies , since those can determine the size of some of the relevant expectation values .",

    "how large the energy release has to be for this simplification to occur can not be predicted ( yet ) .",
    "for the onset of local duality is determined by terms that can not be seen in any finite order of the @xmath70 expansion .",
    "however rather general considerations lead to the following expectations : ( i ) this onset should be quite abrupt around some energy scale exceeding usual hadronic scales .",
    "( ii ) local duality should hold to a good degree of accuracy for beauty decays , even for nonleptonic ones .",

    "if vacuum saturation makes ( approximate ) sense anywhere , it has to be at ordinary hadronic scales @xmath304 gev .",

    "the lifetime of the charm quark is then prolonged by time dilation to a higher degree inside @xmath122 than inside @xmath17 mesons .    while the trend of this effect is quite transparent , its size is not yet clear .",
    "the relevant matrix elements @xmath539 and @xmath540 will be determined from qcd sum rules and lattice simulations in the future . yet in the meantime one can estimate their size from the meson masses in the charm and beauty family according to the following prescription : @xmath541- [ { \\langle m_{b_s}\\rangle}-{\\langle m_b\\rangle}]\\ } \\eqno(78)\\ ] ] where as before @xmath542 denote the spin averaged masses .",
    "accordingly one finds @xmath543 @xmath544- [ { \\langle m_{b_s}\\rangle}-{\\langle m_b\\rangle}]\\ } \\ , .\\eqno(79)\\ ] ] since the @xmath545 mass has not been measured yet , one can not give a specific numerical prediction and has to content oneself with semi - quantitative statements .",
    "a 10 mev shift in any of the terms @xmath546 corresponds numerically to the kinetic energy operator generating approximately a 1% change in the ratio @xmath547 . invoking our present understanding of the heavy quark kinetic energy and its relationship to the hyperfine splitting one arrives at the following _ conjecture _ : @xmath548    \\(d ) the mechanisms listed above in ( a ) - ( c ) taken together can be expected to extend the @xmath122 over the @xmath17 lifetime by at most a few percent .",
    "comparing that estimate with the data allows us to conclude that wa can not change @xmath149 by more than 10 % .",
    "it is however quite unclear how to refine this estimate at present .",
    "for the quantitative impact of wa on charm meson lifetimes in general and on the ratio @xmath149 in particular is the most obscure theoretical element in the analysis .",
    "the uncertainty centers mainly on the question of how much the wa amplitude suffers from helicity suppression .    in the valence quark",
    "approximation the answer is easily given to _",
    "lowest _ order in the strong coupling : the wa amplitude is ( helicity ) suppressed by the ratio @xmath549 , where @xmath22 denotes the largest quark mass in the final state . for a proper qcd treatment",
    "one has to use the _ current _ rather than the larger _ constituent _ mass , at least for the @xmath491 corrections .",
    "the wa amplitude is then small in @xmath17 decays where the helicity factor reads @xmath550 and a fortiori in @xmath122 decays where only non - strange quarks are present in the final state .",
    "the emission of semi - hard gluons that is included by summing the leading log terms in the perturbative expansion can not circumvent this suppression @xcite .",
    "for such gluon corrections ",
    "when properly accounted for  drive the hybrid renormalization of the corresponding four - fermion operators ; however they preserve the lorentz structure of the lowest order term and therefore do not eliminate the helicity suppression .",
    "a helicity allowed amplitude arises in perturbation theory only at the subleading level of order @xmath551 and is thus expected to be numerically insignificant .    on the other hand _ nonperturbative _ dynamics can quite naturally vitiate helicity suppression and thus provide the dominant source of wa .",
    "these nonperturbative effects enter through _ non - factorizable _ contributions to the hadronic matrix elements , as analyzed in considerable detail in refs.@xcite . as such",
    "we do not know ( yet ) , how to predict their weight from first principles .",
    "however , as shown in ref.@xcite , a detailed experimental study of the width of semileptonic decays and their lepton spectra  in particular in the endpoint region  in @xmath17 vs. @xmath122 and/or in @xmath552 vs. @xmath553 decays would allow us to extract the size of the matrix elements that control the weight of wa in all inclusive @xmath246 and @xmath29 decays . before such data become available ,",
    "we can draw only qualitative , or at best semi - quantitative conclusions : wa is not expected to affect the total lifetimes of @xmath122 and @xmath17 mesons by more than 10 - 20 % , and their ratio by less .",
    "furthermore wa does not necessarily decrease @xmath149 ; due to its reduced amplitude its leading impact on the lifetime might be due to its interference with the spectator amplitude and thus it might even _ enhance _ @xmath149 !    to summarize our findings on the @xmath534 lifetime ratio : ( i ) @xmath117 breaking in the expectation values of the dim-5 operators generating the leading nonperturbative corrections of order @xmath423 can  due to ` time dilatation '  increase @xmath56 by 3 - 5 % over @xmath19 .",
    "( ii ) on the @xmath491 level there arise three additional effects .",
    "destructive interference in cabibbo suppressed @xmath122 decays increases @xmath56 again by 3 - 5 % , whereas the single mode @xmath520 decreases it by 3 % .",
    "the three phenomena listed so far combine to yield @xmath554 .",
    "( iii ) any difference over and above that has to be attributed to wa .",
    "therefore one has to interprete the measured @xmath534 lifetime ratio as more or less direct evidence for wa to contribute no more than 10 - 20 % of the lifetime ratio between charm mesons .",
    "this is consistent with the indirect evidence discussed above that wa does not constitute the major effect there .",
    "( iv ) these predictions can be refined in the future by two classes of more accurate data : analyzing the _ difference _ in the semileptonic spectra of charged and neutral mesons in the charm and beauty family allows to extract the size of the matrix elements that control the weight of wa ; measuring the masses of @xmath145 and @xmath545 to better than 10 mev allows to determine the expectation values of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "the lifetimes of the weakly decaying charm baryons reflect a complex interplay of different dynamical mechanisms increasing or decreasing transition rates @xcite : latexmath:[\\[\\gamma ( \\lambda _ c^+)= \\gamma _ { decay}(\\lambda _ c^+ ) + \\gamma _ { ws}(\\lambda _ c^+ ) -    latexmath:[\\[\\gamma ( \\xi _ c^0)= \\gamma _ { decay}(\\xi _ c^0 ) + \\gamma _ { ws}(\\xi _ c^0 ) +    latexmath:[\\[\\gamma ( \\xi _ c^+)= \\gamma _ { decay}(\\xi _ c^+ ) +     expressions for @xmath183 , @xmath453 and @xmath454 are obtained from eqs.(60 ) by the obvious substitutions ; for @xmath556 one finds @xmath557 on rather general grounds one then concludes : @xmath558 to go further requires calculating the relative weight of matrix elements of the four - quark operators . at present",
    "this can be done only by using quark wavefunctions as obtained from a potential ansatz ( or from the quark model ) . in doing so",
    "one also has to pay proper attention to the normalization point appropriate for such an evaluation , i.e. , one has to include ultraviolet as well as hybrid renormalization .",
    "one then arrives at the numbers quoted in table 2 .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that in these expressions one should not use the ` real ' value for the decay constant , as expressed by @xmath36 , and the observed mass splitting , but solely the leading contribution in a @xmath88 expansion : @xmath559 mev and @xmath560 mev .",
    "one reason for that is self - consistency since the widths have been calculated through order @xmath88 only ; the other  and maybe the more telling one  is based on the needs of phenomenology : for otherwise one can not reproduce the observed _ magnitude _ of the lifetime differences .",
    "the predictions given in table 2 agree remarkably well with the data within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties . in the comparison of the @xmath47 and @xmath29 lifetimes",
    "one should note the following : ws and pi _ counteract _ each other in @xmath561 , see eq.(81a ) ; nevertheless @xmath562 can be obtained .",
    "this results from three effects : ( i ) wa is very much reduced in @xmath29 decays .",
    "( ii ) the _ baryonic _ expectation values of the four - quark operators are evaluated , as stated above , with the ` static ' decay constant , which is considerably larger than @xmath36 used for the _ mesonic _ expectation values .",
    "( iii ) the @xmath423 contributions enhance @xmath561 over @xmath563 , as briefly discussed below .",
    "unfortunately there appears now a rather unpleasant ` fly in the ointment ' : as discussed above , extrapolating from these prima facie successful predictions to the lifetimes of beauty baryons leads to a less - than - successful prediction on @xmath142 .",
    "the decays of @xmath51 baryons require  and deserve  a separate treatment : the @xmath199 diquarks carry spin one and the resulting spin - spin interactions of @xmath212 with @xmath199 lead to new effects . to be more specific : through order @xmath491 one",
    "has latexmath:[\\[\\gamma ( \\omega _",
    "c ) = \\gamma _ { decay}(\\omega _ c ) +    the right - hand - side of eq.(84 ) differing from the corresponding ones for @xmath47 or @xmath221 decays .",
    "( i ) firstly , @xmath565 , see eqs.(17b,17c,35 ) .",
    "secondly , it is quite conceivable that these spin - spin interactions can create an appreciable difference in the kinetic energy of the @xmath212 quark inside @xmath51 and @xmath47 baryons . thus there",
    "arise differences of order @xmath423 in the total as well as in the semileptonic widths of @xmath51 and @xmath47 baryons : @xmath566 ( ii ) these spin - spin interactions also affect the expectation values of the dimension - six four - fermion operators that control the strength of ws and the interference effects , see eqs.(24,25 ) , in order @xmath491 .    taking everything together one estimates the @xmath51 to be the shortest lived charm baryon , as shown in table 2 .",
    "this is quite remarkable since it means that the constructive interference in @xmath51 decays outweighs the _ combined _ effect of constructive interference and ws in @xmath48 decays .",
    "it is actually not unexpected on intuitive grounds : in @xmath51 transitions interference can happen with _ both _",
    "constituent @xmath528 quarks whereas in @xmath221 baryons there is only one such @xmath528 quark .",
    "this shows that inclusive weak decay rates can be harnessed to probe the internal structure of charm baryons in a novel way .",
    "as expected , the ratio of the semileptonic @xmath18 and @xmath17 branching ratios agrees , within the errors , with the ratio of their lifetimes : @xmath567 also the _ absolute _ size of , say , @xmath568 is of interest .",
    "if the @xmath569 lifetime difference is generated mainly by a destructive interference affecting @xmath18 transitions , then @xmath17 decays should proceed in a largely normal way and the semileptonic branching ratio of @xmath17 mesons should be at its ` normal ' value . in a parton model description one",
    "finds @xmath570 .",
    "if that number represented the proper yardstick for normal decays , one would actually conclude that @xmath18 decays more or less normally , whereas the nonleptonic decays of @xmath17 are strongly enhanced ;",
    "i.e. , it would imply that it is actually wa that provides the dominant mechanism for the lifetime difference .",
    "this long - standing ` fly in the ointment ' can be removed now . for at order @xmath104 the chromomagnetic operator @xmath175 generates an isoscalar enhancement in the nonleptonic widths of the charged and neutral mesons @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the corresponding reduction in the semileptonic branching ratios of @xmath246 mesons is rather insignificant , namely @xmath480 2 % . yet for charm mesons this reduction is quite large , namely around 40 % , since it is scaled up by @xmath571 and less reduced by colour factors .",
    "the semileptonic branching ratio for @xmath29 mesons is thus around 9 % through order @xmath423  before the dimension - six four - fermion operators reduce @xmath572 by a factor of almost two and enhance @xmath573 by a moderate amount . as discussed above , we have to take these numbers for charm transitions with a grain of salt ; on the other hand the emerging pattern in the ratio of semileptonic branching ratios as well as their absolute size is self - consistent !",
    "it should be apparent from the discussion on @xmath56 vs. @xmath19 that the semileptonic widths and branching ratios of @xmath122 and @xmath17 mesons practically coincide through order @xmath423 . in order @xmath491",
    "wa can contribute to @xmath118 ( as well as to @xmath574 and @xmath573 ) . yet from @xmath575 one",
    "infers that the relative weight of wa is quite reduced ; therefore one expects @xmath576 to differ from @xmath568 by not more than 10% or so in _ either _ direction : @xmath577    the semileptonic width is not universal for all charm hadrons due to @xmath578 contributions even when one ignores cabibbo suppressed channels .",
    "one actually estimates @xmath579 therefore the ratio of semileptonic branching ratios of mesons and baryons does not faithfully reproduce the ratio of their lifetimes .",
    "instead one expects @xmath580",
    "second generation theoretical technologies have been developed for treating heavy - flavour decays that are directly related to qcd without the need for invoking a ` deus ex machina ' .",
    "as far as _ inclusive _ heavy - flavour decays are concerned , the relevant technology is based on an operator expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass .",
    "it allows to express the leading nonperturbative corrections through the expectation values of a small number of dimension - five and -six operators .",
    "basically all such matrix elements relevant for _ meson _ decays can reliably be related to other observables ; this allows to extract their size in a model - independant way .",
    "baryons , however , possess a more complex internal structure , which becomes relevant for their decays in order @xmath88 . at present",
    "one has to rely on quark model calculations to determine the expectation values of the dimension - six operators relevant for lifetime differences .",
    "the numerical results of such computations are of dubious reliability ; accordingly predictions for lifetime ratios involving heavy - flavour _ baryons _ suffer from larger uncertainties than those involving only mesons .",
    "there is also a positive side to this , though : measuring the lifetimes ( and if at all possible also the semileptonic branching ratios ) of the various heavy - flavour baryons sheds new light onto their internal strong dynamics .",
    "comprehensive studies of inclusive weak decays in the charm baryon family are particularly promising from a practical point for such studies on hadronic structure ; for the pre - asymptotic corrections are much larger here than for beauty baryons .    at present there",
    "exists one rather glaring phenomenological problem for the heavy quark expansion and  not surprisingly , as just indicated  it concerns baryon decays : the observed @xmath145 lifetime is clearly shorter than predicted relative to the @xmath124 lifetime .",
    "unless future measurements move it up significantly , one has to pay a theoretical price for that failure . as stated above , for the time being one has to employ a quark model to determine the size of the baryonic expectation values of the relevelant dimenion - six operators .",
    "it is not surprising per se that quark model computations can yield numerically incorrect results , in particular when sizeable cancellations occur between different contributions .",
    "the more serious problem is provided by the following aspects : the analoguous treatment of charm baryons , using the same quark models , had yielded predictions that give not only the correct pattern , but also numerical values for the lifetime ratios which are surprisingly close to the data considering the uncertainties due to higher order terms in the @xmath483 expansion . furthermore scaling these charm lifetime ratios up to the beauty scale , using a @xmath104 and @xmath88 behaviour for the pre - asymptotic corrections from the dimension - five and -six operators , respectively ,",
    "also tells us that the @xmath145 lifetime should be shorter than the @xmath124 lifetime by no more than 10 % . to the degree that the observed value for @xmath142 falls below",
    "0.9 one has to draw the following conclusion : one can not trust the numerical results of quark model calculations for _ baryonic _ matrix elements  not very surprising by itself ; yet furthermore and more seriously it would mean that @xmath581 or even higher order contributions are still relevant in charm baryon decays before fading away for beauty decays .",
    "then one had to view the apparently successful predictions on the lifetimes of charm baryons as largely coincidental  a quite sobering result !",
    "a _ future _ discrepancy between the predictions on @xmath582 or @xmath583 and the data refers to the algebraic average of the two @xmath125 lifetimes . ]  in particular an observation that the lifetime for @xmath553 mesons is definitely _ shorter _ than for @xmath124 mesons  would have quite fundamental consequences . for the leading deviation of these ratios from unity",
    "arises at order @xmath135 and should provide a good approximation since the expansion parameter is small : @xmath584 .",
    "the size of this term is given by the expectation value of a four - fermion operator expressed in terms of @xmath292 .",
    "a failure in this simple situation would raise very serious doubts about the validity or at least the practical relevance of the @xmath70 expansion for treating even fully inclusive nonleptonic transitions ; this would leave only semileptonic transitions in the domain of their applicability .",
    "such a breakdown of quark - hadron duality would _ a priori _ appear as a quite conceivable and merely disappointing scenario .",
    "however such an outcome would have to be seen as quite puzzling _ a posteriori _ ; for in our analysis we have not discerned any sign indicating the existence of such a fundamental problem or a qualitative distinction between nonleptonic and semileptonic decays @xcite .",
    "thus even a failure would teach us a valuable , albeit sad lesson about the intricacies of the strong interactions ; for the heavy quark expansion is directly and unequivocally based on qcd with the only additional assumption concerning the workings of quark - hadron duality !",
    "@xmath46 _ improved _ by a better understanding of quark - hadron duality , preferably by deriving it from qcd or at least by analysing how it operates in the lepton and photon spectra of semileptonic and radiative @xmath246 decays , respectively ;        the extension will certainly have been made very soon ; the refinement should be obtained in the foreseeable future , probably from a lattice simulation of qcd ; when finally quark - hadron duality will be derived from qcd can not be predicted , of course .              *",
