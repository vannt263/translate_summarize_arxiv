    "one of limitations of the present day quantum theories is the `` passive '' evolution picture in which the physical systems ( i.e. , some parts of the universe ) evolve under the influence of `` the rest '' , typically represented by some given ( if not stationary ) external conditions , and the role of active state manipulations is reduced to the choice of initial or boundary conditions .",
    "however , if the physical theories were at all created it is only because the physical systems can be actively manipulated , by changing the external conditions and performing experiments .    in spite of the limited use of dynamical manipulations ,",
    "the present day quantum theories show some spectacular achievements",
    ". however , the concepts applied and questions asked are somewhat repetitive .",
    "what dominates are some idealized scenarios with pure states described always by vectors in the linear ( hilbert ) spaces and the time evolution ( in absence of dissipation ) obeying always the linear , unitary operations .",
    "the picture persists in the description of composite systems and quantum field theories ( qft ) where the states are always represented by tensor product spaces - in a desire to conserve the linearity of basic laws at the cost of multiplying the number of variables .    some doubts ,",
    "though , persist .",
    "can indeed all gedanken states , represented by vectors in hilbert spaces be physically created @xcite ?",
    "moreover , can all unitary operations be achieved ( or at least approximated ) by physical evolution ? in the recent research a lot of attention is dedicated to the finite - dimensional spin states ( qubits ) with hopes to develop quantum computers",
    ". however , can the problem be indeed exhausted by tensor products with complex coefficients ?",
    "one of main troubles in checking the obligatory beliefs of quantum theories , are the perturbative complications as well as the difficulties of extrapolating toward the great and toward the small @xcite . what could help are the exact solutions , though they seldom exist . yet , in certain areas , there appear some windows in perturbative clouds .",
    "this happened in the bound state manipulation @xcite ( nobel prize 2012 for s. haroche and d. wineland ) , in macroscopic superpositions of leggett @xcite , then in works on `` quantum tomography '' @xcite ; last not least , in the duality links between the quantum quark and classical string dynamics @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to show that even the well known and modest case of classical - quantum duality , for particles in time dependent quadratic potentials , has still some unexplored consequences .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec.2 . the particle behavior in 1-dimensional quadratic , time dependent potentials @xmath1 is classified in most elementary terms .",
    "sec.3 reports briefly this classification analogues in the macroscopic world . in sec.4",
    "a class of idealized evolution effects produced by @xmath0-kicks of the quadratic potentials is presented , and sec.5 outlines their optical equivalents . their links with the arguments of aharonov , bohm et al . against the time - energy uncertainty principle .",
    "are reported in sec.6 .",
    "the next secs.7 - 8 show how to design the soft equivalents of the singular pulse operations .",
    "the last sec.9 discusses their possible fundamental implications .",
    "the quantum theories satisfy the _ correspondence principle _ , becoming classical in the macroscopic limit , as @xmath2 .",
    "however , some mathematical aspects are shared by classical and quantum theories without the need of any limiting transition .",
    "the simplest cases occur for non - relativistic time dependent , quadratic hamiltonians in 1d :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the canonical position and momentum variables ( we put for simplicity the mass @xmath6 ) .",
    "below , we shall not consider any higher space dimensions , nor the deeper hilbert space problems ( carefully reviewed by barry simon @xcite ) .",
    "the only challenge we attend is strictly combinatorial : how should one program the oscillations of the @xmath7-number amplitude @xmath8 , to generate some useful quantum control operations ? on purely mathematical level",
    ", the problem is elementary . in classical theory and for nonsingular",
    "@xmath8 the canonical equations lead to the linear evolution transformations of the canonical variables , represented by the @xmath9 symplectic _ evolution matrices _ @xmath10 :    @xmath11    given by the matrix equations : @xmath12 with : @xmath13 and :    @xmath14    in quantum theory , the corresponding evolution operators @xmath15 , are given by :    @xmath16    with :    @xmath17    defining the evolution of the observables @xmath4 and @xmath5 in heisenberg s picture ( the _ `` heisenberg s trajectory '' _ ) , given by the same symplectic matrices ( 3 - 5 ) :    @xmath18    though now @xmath19 are operators with @xmath20=i$ ] ( we put for simplicity @xmath21 ) .",
    "the exact formal correspondence of the classical and quantum cases was explored by multiple research groups , quite frequently without knowing of each other . in all these approaches ,",
    "a useful observation is    * proposition 1 . * in absence of spin or any additional degrees of freedom , each unitary evolution operator @xmath15 in @xmath22 generated by the quadratic , time dependent hamiltonians is determined up to a phase factor by the classical motion trajectories .",
    "* proof . * instead of sophisticated arguments , notice simply that if two unitary operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 produce the same transformation of the canonical variables i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then @xmath27 commutes with both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "hence , it commutes also with any function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , including their spectral projectors .",
    "since in @xmath28 the functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 generate an irreducible algebra , then @xmath27 must be a c- number and since it is unitary , it can be only a phase factor , @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "@xmath31    any two unitary operators which differ only by a c - number phase factor generate the same transformation of quantum states , so we shall call them _ equivalent _ and write @xmath32 ( the fact that they might wear different phase factors can be of interest for the linear representation theory @xcite but does not affect the operations performed on physical states , the principal subject of our interest ) .",
    "the possibility of deducing the quantum state evolution from the transformations of the canonical variables ( [ n8 ] ) permits one to program ample families of the exact classical / quantum control operations . for their classification ,",
    "the algebraic types of matrices ( [ n2]-[n8 ] ) are quite essential .",
    "since every evolution matrix @xmath33 is symplectic ( det@xmath34 ) its algebraic type is defined just by one invariant tr@xmath35 . the characteristic equation :    @xmath36    has two roots @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , permitting to distinguish three types of evolution matrices :    ( * i * ) if @xmath39 , then @xmath35 has two complex eigenvalues @xmath40 where @xmath41    ( * ii * ) if @xmath42 then @xmath35 is in the threshold : @xmath43    ( * iii * ) if @xmath44 , then @xmath35 has two real eigenvalues @xmath45 where @xmath41    the classification turns specially relevant if the function @xmath8 in ( [ n1 ] ) is periodic , @xmath46 , defining a _",
    "floquet process_. the ( crucial ) _ floquet matrices _",
    "@xmath47 define then the repeated evolution incidents .",
    "one easily shows that their types do not depend on @xmath48 .",
    "choosing @xmath49 and denoting for simplicity @xmath50 one sees that the results of the evolution in the sequence of expanding intervals @xmath51 $ ] are given by repetitions of @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "now , if @xmath52 is in the class ( * i * ) the evolution is oscillatory .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath52 define a pair of variables @xmath54 ( generalizing the _ creation _ and _ annihilation _ operators ) which for @xmath55 perform just the phase rotations @xmath56 .",
    "however , if @xmath52 is in the class ( * iii * ) then the equilibrium is lost : the eigenvectors of @xmath52 define two real canonical variables @xmath54 which are multiplied by @xmath57 , ( @xmath58 ) i.e. , endlessly squeezed or endlessly amplified as @xmath59 . in turn , the threshold cases ( * ii * ) offer some exceptional manipulation techniques ; their mechanism is simple , but consequences are not .",
    "the properties of ( [ n1 ] ) intrude also into the spectral problems of the time independent energy operators @xmath60 with arbitrary real potentials @xmath61 . indeed , by looking for the real stationary solutions @xmath62 of the shrodinger equation :    @xmath63\\psi(x ) = 0\\ ] ]    for any real @xmath64 , belonging or not to the spectrum of @xmath65 , one sees that the pair of variables @xmath66 , @xmath67 is displaced along the x - axis according to the 1-st order matrix equation :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "so , by reinterpreting the variable @xmath70 as @xmath71 , @xmath72 as @xmath73 , then @xmath62 and @xmath74 as @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively , one sees that the spectral problem ( [ e9 ] ) has a classical equivalent in form of the oscillator ( [ n1 ] ) with a time dependent elasticity coefficient @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum and the spectral gaps of quantum system ( [ e9 ] ) correspond exactly to the stability and instability ( parametric resonance ) zones of the classical oscillator ( [ n1 ] ) with some consequences for macroscopic phenomena .",
    "curiously , certain aspects of both pictures are opposite .",
    "what in quantum case was the synonym of stability ( an energy eigenstate ) corresponds to an exceptional , highly unstable orbit in the classical picture .",
    "this equivalence inspired avron and simon to describe the structure of saturn rings by spectral bands and gaps of the schrodinger s energy operator @xcite ( an analogy worth attention , even if astronomers opted for different models ) . in a different scale ,",
    "the abrupt changes of the classical trajectories ( [ e10 ] ) as @xmath64 evolves , reflecting the behavior of the schrodinger s wave function ( [ e9 ] ) , can be used in an efficient computer method to solve the spectral problems of the potential wells by observing the instabilities of classical trajectories @xcite .",
    "some intriguing cases of quantum - classical duality appear in the relativistic cosmology , where certain variants of the schroedinger equation are used to extrapolate the past cosmos evolution near the big - bang @xcite .",
    "if such cosmological reinterpretation were correct , then due to the exceptional character of the schroedinger energy eigenstates , it could also reveal some instability mechanisms of avron - simon type in our reconstruction of the early universe ( or its distant future ) , usually neglected in the cosmological slow roll ",
    "models @xcite ( see also discussions in @xcite ) . while the cosmic parameters can be studied ( but not manipulated ) , our purpose below will be to discuss the parallel chapters of quantum control , which can suggest the laboratory operations .",
    "the exact solutions of ( [ n1 ] ) were widely explored by lewis and riesenfeld @xcite , then by malkin , manko , trifonov @xcite in terms of _ adiabatic invariants _ , interrelated also with an important techniques of _ quantum tomography _",
    "@xcite . the mathematical algorithms , though elementary , are not immediate to apply ( they require anyhow the solution of the 2-nd order differential eq . , complicated frequently by pertubative difficulties ) .",
    "as independently observed , one of the simplest ways to control the dynamical evolution consists in generating a closed evolution pattern ( _ evolution loop _ ) and then considering their perturbed or deformed versions .",
    "if the unperturbed evolution is represented by a certain family of unitary operators @xmath77 , then the perturbed evolution operators split into @xmath78 , where @xmath77 represent the basic dynamical process and @xmath79 is the correction ( the evolution in the _ interaction frame _ ) .",
    "if now at some moment @xmath80 the basic evolution closes to a loop @xmath81 , then the full evolution reduces just to the pure deformation , @xmath82 represented on fig.1 , in general , much easier to manipulate by the external fields .",
    "the most elementary evolution loops occur in the time independent oscillator potentials , leading e.g. , to the _ non - demolishing quantum measurements _",

    "sensitive to manipulation programs.,width=207 ]    the existence of _ non - adiabatic _ loops generated by time dependent oscillator forces was noticed in 1970 by malkin and manko @xcite , though without elaborating the operational consequences .",
    "the possibility of driving the quantum states by @xmath88-pulses of the external fields was considered by lamb jr.@xcite .",
    "an extremely simple class of exact though formal solutions of in @xmath89 was obtained in @xcite by superposing two types of elementary operations : the incidents of free evolution and the effects of the sharp pulses of oscillator potentials .",
    "each free evolution incident in any interval @xmath90 $ ] produces the unitary evolution operator @xmath91 , where @xmath92 . in turn , the result of each sudden @xmath0-kick of the quadratic potential @xmath93 ( where @xmath94 is the pulse amplitude ) , is most easily described by adopting the rectangular @xmath0-model defined by @xmath95 in a narrow interval @xmath96 $ ] and vanishing outside . the evolution in @xmath96 $ ] is then induced by the constant hamiltonian @xmath97 and the corresponding unitary operator @xmath98}= \\text{e}^{-i[\\epsilon \\frac{p^2}{2 } + a\\frac{q^2}{2 } ] } \\rightarrow   \\text{e}^{-ia\\frac{q^2}{2}}$ ] for @xmath99 . in agreement with the baker formula @xcite :    @xmath100 + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2!}[a,[a , b]]+\\frac{\\lambda^3}{3!}[a,[a , [ a , b]]]+\\dots,\\ ] ]    both operations lead to extremely simple transformations of the canonical pair @xmath19 .",
    "the free evolution incidents generate :    @xmath101    while the potential shocks :    @xmath102    within this scheme , an interesting operation is performed by a pair of free evolution steps separated by an oscillator pulse :    @xmath103    it generates : @xmath104 which might be called the _ squeezed fourier transformation_. curiously , an equivalent operation is performed by :    @xmath105    henceforth the following product of the 6 unitary operations yields the transformation @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( the parity operator )    @xmath108    whereas the sequence of 12 unitary terms produces an evolution loop : @xmath109    an intriguing property of ( [ loop1 ] ) is that all 6 free evolution exponents arise with the same signs and so do the exponents of the kick operations ( a kind of non - perturbative baker - campbell - hausdorff effect @xcite ) .",
    "more important aspect of ( [ loop1 ] ) is that it contains the free evolution intervals ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "it means that the remaining eleven unitary operations must cause the free evolution inversion :    @xmath110    -pulses of the attractive oscillator potential of amplitudes @xmath111 are represented by the hexagon vertices s , while the 6 sides symbolize the @xmath112-intervals of the free evolution .",

    "notice that in this way , the loop mechanism ( [ loop1 ] , [ inve ] ) predicted a part of the 1990 hypothesis about the quantum _ time machine _ @xcite .",
    "the similar effects can be caused by elastic pulses with alternating signs .",
    "their basic element might be the sequence of 4 operators @xmath113 , represented by the exponential functions of the nilpotent matrices @xmath114 , @xmath115 : @xmath116 the algebraic properties of @xmath117 depend again on the @xmath118 .",

    "one of simplest cases occurs for @xmath122 ; the hamilton cayley eq . for @xmath120 then implies @xmath123 and so , the pulse pattern @xmath117 , if repeated , creates the 16-step evolution loop , in which the sum of the oscillator pulses cancels , but the effects do nt :    @xmath124 ^ 4 \\equiv 1\\ ] ]    an elementary algebra permits as well to predict some more general effects such as the time squeezing , i.e. , accelerating or slowing down the free evolution @xcite .",

    "the lower and upper borderlines mark the stability area where the evolution is confined . the dotted curve between marks the zeroes of where the motions form octagonal loops .",

    "the stability areas on the ( @xmath166)-map are then determined by the _ strutt diagram _ @xcite .",
    "each stability arm extends toward the negative values of @xmath167 ( repulsive oscillators ) which may be intuitively expected to accelerate the expulsion , but instead , they protect the particle against the repelling action of the oscillating field .",
    "the effect shows also some similarity to the behavior of a charged particle moving in crossed electric and magnetic fields in presence of a repellent obstacle in form of a rigid disk @xcite . in this scheme , the particle returns obsessively to the obstacle : but should the repellent disk disappear , it will escape .",
    "the question , whether an analogous effect can exist for other , non - quadratic potentials is open .",
    "should it occur for the repulsive coulomb fields submerged in pulsating perturbations , it might contribute to a better understanding of some solid state effects such as the mechanism of cooper pairs .",
    "while the realistic cases of the idealized operations are still under discussion , it was recently noticed that almost all quadratic control algorithms admit a distinct interpretation . as reported by wolf @xcite ,",
    "the evolution operations generated by the hamiltonians ( [ n1 ] ) have some simple equivalents in the optical experiments on 1d optical bench .",
    "in particular , the @xmath9 matrix transformations ( [ ev1 ] , [ ev2 ] , [ squeez ] ) of the canonical variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 correspond exactly to the application of some typical optical instruments ( microscopes , telescopes etc ) well known in the geometrical optics .",
    "in fact , supposing that @xmath4 is the distance from the bench axis @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is an angle between the light ray and the @xmath168 axis , the matrix ( [ ev1 ] ) describes the optical images formed by the congruence of light rays propagating along the bench , where @xmath112 is now the @xmath168-distance between the source and the image , while ( [ ev2 ] ) describes the action of a thin optical lens placed on the bench , the amplitude @xmath94 meaning the ( positive or negative ) lens curvature @xcite ) .",
    "both interpretations have certain gaps and advantages .",
    "thus , what in the dynamical language is an _ evolution loop _ ( convenient for the dynamical manipulations ) , in optical terms is the simple reproduction of an optical image . the squeezing / amplification mechanisms produced by two or more oscillator shocks in quantum mechanics are easily interpretable as the applications of the microscope ( or telescope ) in geometrical optics .",
    "( so , in a sense , the effects of the oscillator kicks were known already to galileo ) .",
    "moreover , what was not so easy to predict in the dynamical language , i.e. , the asymmetry of @xmath8 needed to produce the squeezing , is immediately obvious at the optical level .",
    "( in fact , the symmetric apparatus could not produce amplified or reduced images ) .",
    "both , dynamical and optical techniques have also their specific imperfections . in the terrain of optics , the applications of too close lenses with too big",
    "@xmath171 would mean that a part of one lens ( if not the whole ) must overlap with the interior of the other .",
    "more exact equivalents of the elastic pulses were subsequently considered in works on optical signals in dispersive fibers @xcite ( more recent studies , c.f . also @xcite ) . in quantum mechanics of particles driven by potentials in ion",
    "traps the exact application of @xmath0 kicks is practicably impossible . forgetting even about the finite resistance of the trap walls , no infinite energy shocks can be truly engineered",
    "yet , despite all their imperfections , the idealized optical ( or dynamical ) operations might be of interest for some unfinished fundamental discussions .",
    "indeed , it is enough to remind the doubts concerning the `` time - energy uncertainty principle '' .",
    "it looks that the `` squeezed fourier '' transformations can bring some new elements to the list of critical arguments .",
    "the first objections against the ( too vebal ) interpretations of landau and peierls @xcite supporting this principle , appeared in the study of aharonov and bohm in 1961 @xcite . the doubts returned in @xcite and other papers .",
    "further arguments against too dogmatic formulations were collected in aharonov , massar and popescu who argue that an arbitrarily exact measurement of the energy of a quantum system can be performed in an arbitrarily short time , provided that `` the measurement is brutal '' .",
    "their illustration was the spin measurement @xcite .",
    "as it seems , the pulse patterns of sec.4 bring the next illustration to the same idea .",
    "indeed , suppose that the two @xmath0-pulses divided only by a very short time interval @xmath112 , or alternatively , one @xmath0-pulse of the oscillator potential between two infinitesimal intervals of the free evolution , perform the `` squeezed fourier transformation '' of a free particle propagating initially with an energy @xmath172 . after the operation , the unknown ( classical or quantum ) momentum @xmath5 is converted into the new particle position @xmath173 .",
    "could such transformation be produced , it would be no longer necessary to detect directly the particle energy , e.g. , by observing its collision with a heavier microobject @xcite",
    ". it would be enough to measure its new position @xmath174 .",
    "whatever the technical difficulties , there is no fundamental law which would forbid to determine the new position @xmath174 in an arbitrarily short time . would be used to detect its momentum @xmath5 .",
    "is it not in conflict with the position - momentum uncertainty ? yet , it is not , since @xmath174 and @xmath5 are the particle position and momentum in different time moments . in the orthodox quantum oscillator ,",
    "the position measurement at some time moment @xmath71 is equivalent to the momentum measurement at @xmath175 , where t is the oscillator period ( compare with the nondemolishing measurement @xcite ) . ]    what one can still object , is that our particular prescriptions of generating offer an inconvenient relation between the finally measured @xmath174 and the momentum @xmath5 prior to the applied operation .",
    "the @xmath173 implies @xmath176 , so if the operation time @xmath112 is very short , then little errors in measuring @xmath174 will correspond to much greater errors in @xmath5 .",
    "it looks almost as the vengeance of the time - energy uncertainty .",
    "yet , it is nt ! in fact , @xmath112 is a @xmath7-number parameter defining the time of an external operation , valid in classical as well as in quantum theory , an authentic _ external time _ in sense of aharonov and bohm @xcite , and @xmath177 _ is not _ limited by any universal constant .",
    "moreover , still accepting the pulse solutions , the dynamics of the time dependent hamiltonians ( [ n1 ] ) can offer much better measurement methods .",
    "following the optical analogy @xcite , we could call it : +   + _ the `` fourier microscope''_.    indeed , it is enough to apply three consecutive squeezed fourier transformations , to obtain a unitary operator with a more convenient transformation matrix :    @xmath178    where the new coefficient @xmath179 is unlimited .",
    "thus , taking @xmath180 , one would obtain a `` squeezing mechanism '' where the final position @xmath181 for large @xmath182 leads to insignificant errors in @xmath183 even if the @xmath174 measurement is far from perfect .",
    "the problem of an efficient empirical design is still open .",
    "one of the simplest ways of measuring the microparticle position is to let it interact with a lattice of mesoscopic absorption centers ( e.g. , grains of photographic emulsion ) , one of which turns dark , marking the new particle position @xmath174 . as the particle is projected into a lattice , the @xmath177 errors will be of order of magnitude of the lattice distance @xmath184 between the neighboring mesoscopic centers , but anyhow , the initial particle momentum @xmath5 can be determined with an arbitrarily small error @xmath185 if @xmath186 is little enough . while technical difficulties still exists , they do not seem a fundamental obstacle .",
    "the operations considered above are singular and concern the states in 1 space dimension .",
    "their generalization in 2d and 3d , employing as well @xmath0-kicks , were considered by fernandez @xcite , including the comments on the _ time - energy _ uncertainty , though the results somehow escaped attention in the noise of the research markets . yet , all effects described above are just idealized forms of some natural phenomena which might be of technical interest . in particular , the merits of the evolution loops were noticed again in the control problem of finite dimensional spaces ( qubits ) @xcite , recognized more generally in @xcite . the continuous evolution affected by sequences of sharp @xmath0-kicks , under the name of _ decouplers _ ,",
    "are now studied for the spin systems , as one of promising quantum control methods @xcite ( the so called _",
    "bam - bam_-control ) , though less violent methods are also considered @xcite . in the infinite dimensional @xmath89 the soft alternatives of the potential kicks can be no less interesting .",
    "as the matter of fact , the techniques of applying the non - singular , bounded fields ( e.g. in form of rectangular steps ) allowed already to design an ample family of dynamical operations including the squeezing , distorted free evolution , etc .",
    "the possibility of approaching the same effects by softly varying , differentiable fields ( without any steps ) was considered in @xcite , then elaborated in computer studies for charged particles submerged in harmonic pulses @xcite .",

    "it looks that the dynamical state transformations described above , can occur under the influence of softly varying external fields , perhaps , in standing wave equivalents of the laser beam traps ? ( or in some variants of the structured fields @xcite ? ) .",
    "below , we shall try to see whether they can be achieved for charged particles in the traditional ion traps .",
    "the description of quantum states in the ion traps depends on multiple idealizations which may fail in various points .",
    "thus , the commonly used oscillator potentials in the penning and paul traps neglect the granular structure of the trap walls ( which are never exactly smooth ! ) .",
    "moreover , the traps are typically designed to maintain the charged particles to investigate their internal degrees rather than to manipulate the position and momentum states . in some cases ( including the mass spectroscopy )",
    "the trap is just a system of parallel metal bars @xcite , so the charged particle can be efficiently trapped without obeying the mathieu equations .",
    "moreover , even for almost perfect hyperbolic walls , there are still multiple problems concerning the quadratic hamiltonians .",
    "the most important ones are the limitations of non - relativistic approach . in reality ,",
    "any potential pulse applied to the trap surface needs some time to propagate over the trap walls and to penetrate into its interior .",
    "moreover , even if the delay is negligible , the too fast field changes can awake the radiative pollution , usually neglected in the trap descriptions .",
    "the cases of dynamical transformations generated with some precision are indeed not many .",
    "the results for the spin ( qubit ) states seem promising @xcite though usually limited to finite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "a notable success was achieved by techniques of inducing the rabi rotations between the pairs of bound states of hydrogen - like atoms ( the `` pink states '' @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , the paradoxes of quantum mechsanics are still showing some intriguing possibilities @xcite .",
    "a progress is also noticed in `` quantum tomography '' @xcite ( see , e.g. , the `` robust '' results in @xcite ) .",
    "our algorithms of sec.7 , while simplifying a part of the problem , are still far from this level .",
    "yet , they may suggest a new advance in the traditional domain .    instead of just keeping the ions to monitor their internal structure",
    ", it could be as interesting to inject a single charged particle into the variable trap fields , and manipulate its position - momentum state to check with some more details the traditional motion laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "the fields in the trap should be coherent , without inducing the sharp absorption / emission effects ( i.e. , slowly varying , long waves , formed by clouds of tiny quanta ) .",
    "the laser cooling @xcite could help at the preliminary stage , but not during the proper evolution experiments , which should neither be interrupted ( decoupled ? ) by sudden kicks @xcite . to avoid the packet reflections from the walls , the trap should be wider than the traditional @xmath327 ( see paul @xcite ) . but",
    "how ample could it be ?",
    "the answer depends on the relativistic corrections .    in the relativistic theories a useful tool is the traditional einstein - infeld - hofmann ( eih ) method @xcite of develloping the physical data into the increasing powers of @xmath328 ( newtonian , post - newtonian , etc . ) . in our case , if the interval @xmath329}$ ] in propositions 3 - 7 is too short , the functions @xmath170 and @xmath230 oscillate fast ; so the eih terms will show the insufficiency of the quadratic formula .",
    "however , an inverse option of using soft and slowly changing fields in longer time intervals might reduce the difficulty .",
    "indeed , imagine that the trap surface @xmath330 is a perfectly conducting ( metallic ) shell , composed of a number of disjoint leafs , @xmath331 , surrounding a certain operation domain @xmath332 .",
    "consider then a static charge distribution @xmath333 on @xmath330 creating a scalar potential @xmath334 , constant on every connected leaf @xmath335 and harmonic in @xmath336 , corresponding to a solution of the traditional electrostatic problem .",
    "assume now , that the charge density on @xmath330 starts to evolve as @xmath337 , where @xmath187 is a certain continuous field amplitude with @xmath338 .",
    "if such a homogeneous change of the charge density could be produced all over @xmath330 , then , in agreement with the linearity of the theory , the local change of the scalar potential @xmath334 on @xmath330 would be @xmath339 .",
    "however , what will be the response of the rest of the field in @xmath336 ?    in the coulomb gauge it would be just an instantaneous effect of the changing surface density @xmath340 , given by : @xmath341 . however , the coulomb gauge is not convenient to describe the field propagation ( it requires the non - local transversal currents @xcite ) . to avoid this ,",
    "it is easier to work in the lorentz gauge , where the _absolute time_ @xmath71 in the coulomb integral must be replaced by the retarded time @xmath342 integrated over all sources @xcite",
    ". then , one can observe that for @xmath343 the @xmath328-contributions unexpectedly simplify , resembling the effect noticed by griffiths @xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath230 does not even need to be analytic ; if only : @xmath344 , then @xmath345 inside of @xmath336 reduces to :    @xmath346    where @xmath347 is the initial static charge on @xmath330 and the last term represents the first non - trivial correction of the delay mechanism .",
    "in addition , if the operation takes place in a traditional ion trap , where @xmath330 splits into several disjoint leafs with opposite charges , then the @xmath328-terms completely cancel and the last term of is the only @xmath334-correction of the @xmath348 eih - order .    in paul s description ,",
    "the time dependence was periodic and the dimensionless time coordinate was @xmath349 . if , however , the time dependence of @xmath187 is arbitrary , then it is convenient to describe the changes of @xmath333 on @xmath330 in terms of a fixed time unit @xmath112 independent of any frequency .",
    "it can be done by replacing @xmath350 leading to the correction @xmath351 , which can be also written as @xmath352    where the dimensionless amplitude in the integral of is :    @xmath353    the real size of the trap is of course not infinite , but it seems that to perform the operations of our sec.7 it can be much wider than @xmath354 assumed in the paul s report , specially , if the the time unit @xmath112 is not too small .",
    "in fact , by assuming @xmath355 then @xmath356 , and the distances @xmath357 limited by @xmath358 in the real trap laboratory , we would end up with a tolerant estimation    @xmath359    apart of the scalar potential @xmath345 what matters is the vector potential @xmath360 created by the external currents @xmath361 needed to feed the variable charge density @xmath362 .",
    "what we know about them is only that when arriving at the surface @xmath330 , they must obey @xmath363 , to assure the charge density accumulating as @xmath364 .",
    "the vector potential @xmath360 enters into the dynamical equations in two places : ( 1 ) by contributing to the expression for the electric field , @xmath365 and ( 2 ) by defining the magnetic field @xmath366 ( both depending on the geometry of the external currents , but contributing to the motion equations with @xmath348 - eih terms only ) .    in case of cylindric traps with variable potentials",
    "@xmath367 , one might imagine a particle crossing the trap in the @xmath168-direction with the velocity @xmath368 defined well enough to feel the influence of @xmath187 in some given operation interval , with the perpendicular momenta @xmath369 not too high , so that the partial states on the @xmath370- plane would perform the evolution processes described by the quadratic hamiltonians .    the exact control of the initial and final operation moments and of the initial and final particle state are still absent , so our description is an intuitive rather than empirical design . what it implies , however , is that all previously described operations can indeed occur in the trap interiors , thus confirming the reality the squeezed fourier , the retarded , advanced or inverted free evolution incidents , as well as the simulation of the positive or negative pulses of the oscillator potential @xcite .    the unsolved problems , however , are two .",
    "( 1 ) how to produce the pulse amplitudes @xmath187 depending arbitrarily on time ? ( 2 ) how to assure that they will appear at the points of the trap surface simultaneously ?",
    "should one imagine a dense net of cables running from a common source of voltage to the net of points on the surface @xmath330 ? should these technologies be achieved ( or at least approximated ) , can it be expected that the ion traps of the internal diameters 5@xmath371 ( or more ) instead of 5@xmath372 could become the efficient `` wave packet laboratories '' ?",
    "appart of purely technical challenge , the quantum state manipulations can give us a hint about the validity limits of our theories , including the controversies about fundamental problems such as the time - energy uncertainty , which might still deserve some comments .",
    "one of reasons which could support the time - energy uncertainty principle was the idea that the _ time _ and _ energy _ are a pair of canonically conjugate space - time observables ( @xmath373 , and @xmath374 ) whose quantum equivalents should therefore obey @xmath375= i\\hbar\\rightarrow \\delta { \\bf t } \\delta { \\bf e}\\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ ]",
    ". the idea seemed verbally plausible @xcite and the collection of difficulties was not immediately noticed .",
    "yet , it was never obvious why the probability of the `` time of arrival '' should be normalized in time ( the particle may arrive at the detector many times or never ) . the most dangerous paradox , though , was the _ theorem of pauli_. if the hypothetical time and energy operators @xmath376 are self - adjoint and fulfill @xmath375= i\\hbar$ ] , then both must have continuous , translation invariant spectra .",
    "in particular , @xmath377 can not have the lower bound , against all known facts concerning the energy operators !    in an effort to avoid the pauli s paradox ,",
    "kijowski @xcite considered the 1-dimensional simplified model replacing the free energy operator @xmath378 by @xmath379 with an infinite spectrum covering @xmath235 , and then constructed the canonically conjugated time @xmath380 ( an idea followed implicitly in a trend of papers @xcite ) .",
    "however , the physical interpretation turned artificial . in order to avoid troubles ,",
    "the formalism should be limited either to the wave packets localized to the left from the detector and moving to the right ( the right movers ) , or vice versa . yet , to restrict the problem to the left component is not the same as to consider the right movers ( and vice versa ) . moreover , the obtained probability distribution excluded the interference of both ( left and right ) components at the detection point against the basic principles of quantum theory ( the difficulty discovered by leavens @xcite ) . in spite of subsequent works on pov measures and some new but still partial results @xcite",
    ", it turns obvious that the idea of time - operator has too many gaps to grant the _ time - energy _ uncertainty ( except if some additional limitations of quantum measurements proved real @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , the counter - arguments of aharonov , bohm and other authors @xcite grow stronger . in terms of our proposals , it is not even necessary to assure that the transformation @xmath381 ( squeezed fourier ) of our sec.7 can be performed arbitrarily fast .",
    "enough , if it will be achieved with sufficient precision after some finite time ( call it @xmath382 ) .",
    "if the new particle position @xmath383 will admit a measurement precise enough , then the measurement of the initial ( free ) energy @xmath384 , can turn too exact for the _ time - energy _ uncertainty ( following the suggestion in @xcite ) .",
    "though the practical solution is still missing , what matters are not the technical difficulties , but the absence of any universal barriere .",
    "so , is the barrier indeed absent ?",
    "_ is there a minimal distance ? _ the techniques described in sec.7 could provide also some insight into the quantum structure `` in the little '' , e.g. to check some ideas about the universal limits which could forbid too small distances or too great momenta @xcite .",
    "it includes , in particular , the hypothesis that the position measurements by heisenberg microscope can not shrink the wave packets beyond some minimal size , related to the planck distance @xcite .",
    "however , one has to remember that the arbitrarily narrow wave packets are just the linear combinations of much wider ones ( the fourier transforms , wavelets , etc . ) .",
    "so , if the evolution laws are indeed linear ( the discussions seem not yet concluded ; see @xcite but also @xcite ) and if only the most insignificant squeezing of all position variables @xmath385 , @xmath386 , @xmath387 could be performed ( and , of course repeated ) it would violate any limits of the wave packets compression and similarly , abolish any upper bound of the packet momentum . hence ,",
    "if such limits exist , they should be indirectly observed , by failures of the squeezed fourier , or ordinary coordinate squeezing even in mesoscopic levels .",
    "quite similar remarks concern the hypothesis of non - commutative geometries of the space coordinates ( assumed sometimes to prevent the singularity creation below the planck scale @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest case of @xmath388=i\\nu$ ] , ( with @xmath389 ) , if @xmath70 and @xmath390 were interpreted as the coordinates of some microobject , could not survive even the most insignificant squeezing of both @xmath70 and @xmath390 .    some less destructive implications might still exist without challenging the spacetime structure .",
    "indeed , if the squeezing / amplification can be generated for the continuous space variables , then it might help to observe some traditional quantum effects .",
    "in fact , the quantum mechanical particle - wave duality is difficult to observe for beams of heavy particles , with very narrow wave fronts running almost along the classical trajectories .",
    "if , however , the coordinate amplification can be engineered , expanding the wave fronts without affecting the coherence , then it could help to detect the heavy particles interference , or else , the duality limitations if they exist .",
    "appart of these particular problems , the techniques of the dynamical state transformations might still check some more general mysteries . in spite of their successes",
    ", it seems frustrating that all quantum theories were constructed just by multiplying _",
    "ad infinitum _ the same linear state - observable structure , while leaving the basic paradoxes almost forgotten .",
    "until now , the scheme never failed .",
