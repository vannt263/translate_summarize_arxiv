    "observations of co millimeter emission lines also provide an estimate of the systemic velocity provided that the emitting gas is uniformly distributed around a star .",

    "( 1997 ) reported the detection of c@xmath20 swan and phillips , and cn red system lines from several vibrational bands .",
    "many rotational lines of the c@xmath20 bands , as expected for a homonuclear molecule , are seen for each band .",
    "the circumstellar lines of the cn bands are restricted to low-@xmath22 lines .",
    "our measurements of c@xmath20 swan 0 - 2 and 0 - 3 and cn red system 1 - 0 lines shows that they are shifted by @xmath1910.2 @xmath12 1.0  km s@xmath11 relative to the systemic velocity , a velocity difference identified as the expansion velocity ( v@xmath23 ) of that region of the circumstellar shell containing the c@xmath20 and cn molecules .",
    "this expansion velocity is similar to the estimate of 13.1 km s@xmath11 from the width of the co millimeter emission lines ( hrivnak @xmath5 kwok 1999 ) .",
    "our detections of optical circumstellar molecular blue - shifted lines for iras  22272 + 5435 are the first for this star which is too warm to show photospheric molecular lines .",
    "swan system lines give an expansion velocity of 6.3 @xmath12 0.3 km s@xmath11 which compares with 8.0 to 12 km s@xmath11 from the widths of co millimeter lines ( loup et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "an exciting observation is the apparent presence of the lii 6707  resonance doublet weakly in absorption in both spectra .",
    "but excitement is tempered by the additional observation that the line is displaced redward by about 0.2    from the wavelength expected of a photospheric line .",
    "understanding this shift and the line profile is a prerequisite to determining the stellar lithium abundance .",
    "a clue to the correct interpretation of the lii line is , in the case of iras  05113 + 1347 provided by inspection of the resonance line profiles of the more abundant alkali atoms na and k. figure 5a shows the profiles of the nai d@xmath24 , the ki 7699 , and the lii doublet as observed on 1999 december 31 .",
    "emission in the core of the nai d lines exceeds the local continuum .",
    "this emission , which is from the star and not the nightsky , divides the absorption profile into two components which we label a and b. similar emission may be imagined in the ki line but it is evidently weaker with the line profile more strongly suggesting the presence of the two absorption components .",
    "the peak nai emission is at a velocity of 7 km s@xmath11 , which is the photospheric / systemic velocity ( table 3 ) .",
    "this suggests that emission may arise from a large shell , presumably a part of the expanding circumstellar envelope responsible for the co millimeter emission .",
    "the spectrum from march 26 , 2001 does not show na d emission but the components a and b remain .",
    "profiles of the li i and ki resonance lines are almost unchanged between the two observations .",
    "emission in the na d lines , if present in iras  22272 + 5435 , is very weak .",
    "the absorption for this star consists of at least four components : a and b with the same presumed origins as the a and b components in iras  05113 + 1347 , and two additional components assigned an interstellar origin and labelled is in figure 5b .    for both stars , absorption component",
    "a is redshifted relative to the systemic velocity by about 10 km s@xmath11 .",
    "similar velocity shifts were found for the two pagb stars studied previously ( reddy et al .",
    "1999 ) . that the component is similar for four stars suggests that it has a common origin , and is not , for example , simply an intruding interstellar line",
    "two possibilities may be considered : the component is primarily of photospheric origin but redshifted because the line is preferentially formed in cool downdrafts ; the line is formed in infalling circumstellar gas .",
    "present evidence suggests the latter is more probable because it appears that only resonance lines of low ionization potential atoms are affected .",
    "if the former explanation were valid , one would expect to see a velocity shift between low excitation lines of nai , and cai ( for example ) and high excitation lines of ci and oi but table  3 shows no differences .",
    "of course , the presence of infalling ( component a ) with outflowing ( component b ) implies a complicated circumstellar shell but such a juxtaposition is not unknown for giant stars .",
    "if component a is taken to be the photospheric line shifted by convective downflow , central emission is seen in all observations of the na d and ki profiles . the predicted photospheric ki profile ( fig .",
    "5 ) is based on the inferred normal abundances for [ fe / h ] @xmath25 @xmath190.8 , and the kurucz model .",
    "the true profiles in the actual convective photospheres are surely somewhat different .",
    "the emission with component b constitutes a p cygni profile provided by circumstellar alkali atoms .",
    "lithium may be similarly affected .",
    "elemental abundances were determined using the code moog ( sneden 1973 ) in combination with the adopted model atmosphere .",
    "most of the selected lines are unblended and computing abundances from equivalent width measurements works well . for a few elements which suffer from blends and/or hyperfine structure ,",
    "abundances were determined using spectrum synthesis .    a summary of abundances for iras  05113 + 1347 and iras  22272 + 5435 is given in table  4 where @xmath26 is the number of lines , and @xmath27 is the standard deviation representing scatter among lines . the quantity log  @xmath28(x ) = log ( @xmath29)+12 is the abundance of an element x relative to a hydrogen abundance of 12 on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the ratio [ x / h ] = log  @xmath30)@xmath19 log  @xmath31 refers to the stellar abundance relative to the solar photospheric abundances of grevesse @xmath5 sauval ( 1998 ) .",
    "the abundances relative to iron [ x / fe ] = [ x / h]@xmath19[fe / h ] are computed using our derived stellar iron abundances of [ fe / h ] .",
    "errors in the abundance analysis come from different sources .",
    "errors in the adopted @xmath8-values and in the measured @xmath32 introduce uncertainties .",
    "these errors can be represented by the standard deviation , @xmath27 ( table  4 ) that measures the scatter among the individual lines . the true error , i.e. , standard deviation of the mean @xmath33 , is less for elements represented by many lines . for abundances which are derived by fewer than 3 lines",
    "the real error may be large , and we adopted @xmath27 = 0.2  dex for these sources of error .",
    "the abundances are also model dependent .",
    "the four parameters : @xmath17 , log  @xmath14 , @xmath34 , and [ m / h ] that are required to select the atmospheric model are somewhat coupled .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath7 can be estimated by examining the relation between the lower excitation potential and abundance .",
    "the slope of the fit to the observations is quite sensitive to @xmath7 .",
    "the error ( standard deviation ) in the slope @xmath35 0.03 translates into an uncertainty in the @xmath7 of 150  k. similarly , we estimated uncertainty in @xmath34 . in the case of log",
    "@xmath14 , the error is estimated by introducing 0.1  dex difference in abundance between neutral and ionized lines .",
    "thus , the estimated uncertainties in the input model parameters are as follows : @xmath36@xmath37 = 150  k , @xmath36log @xmath14 = 0.50  dex , @xmath36@xmath34 = 0.50 km s@xmath11 , and @xmath36[m / h ] = 0.25  dex .",
    "the uncertainties in the abundance ratios as a result of uncertainties in the model parameters are given in the table  5 for iras  05113 + 1345 .",
    "the values in the table  5 show that the abundance ratios are less affected by uncertainties in the [ m / h ] and @xmath34 .",
    "the uncertainty in the gravity of 0.5  dex changes the ratios up to 0.15  dex .",
    "the abundance ratios determined from the lines of high excitation are found to be sensitive to changes in @xmath17 ( table  5 ) .",
    "for each element the quadratic sum of the uncertainties in the four model parameters is given as @xmath38 .",
    "our results for iras  22272 + 5435 differ quite considerably in several key respects from those published by zas et al .",
    "the differences are not related to slight differences in the adopted fundamental parameters .",
    "there is a small difference in the derived iron abundances : we obtain [ fe / h ] = @xmath190.8 but zas et al .",
    "got [ fe / h ] = @xmath190.5 .",
    "large differences are found for many other elements .",
    "for example , they reported several cases of extraordinary enhancements relative to iron : e.g. , ratios for elements around iron include [ cr / fe ] = @xmath392.0 , [ ni / fe ] = @xmath391.5 , and [ zn / fe ] = @xmath392.2 . in all cases ,",
    "our ratios are close to the expected values for a moderately metal - poor star , that is [ cr / fe ] = [ ni / fe ] = [ zn / fe ] @xmath25 0.0 .",
    "although our analyses agree that the @xmath0-process elements are severely overabundant , abundances in the two analyses differ by up to 1.0 dex .",
    "these differences may perhaps be traceable to the lower resolution of the spectra used by zas et al . , and their tendency to include strong lines in the abundance analysis .",
    "scrutiny of their list of measured lines showed several cases where we identified much weaker lines with the transition that they used .",
    "the abundance of carbon is determined using three different indicators : permitted ci lines , the forbidden ci line at 8727.1    ( this line is not measured in the spectrum of iras  22272 + 5435 ) , and lines of the cn red system at 8035   .",
    "the forbidden ci line is a superior c abundance indicator as it is unaffected by nlte ( gustafsson et al .",

    "non - lte effects may also be a factor .",
    "the cn red system lines yield a higher abundance by 0.3  dex than the forbidden line",

    "low mass red giants are predicted to experience three episodes in which the deep convective envelope brings nuclear - processed material from the interior to the atmosphere .",
    "the first episode known as the first dredge - up occurs when the star ascends the red giant branch , after exhaustion of hydrogen in the core of the main sequence star .",
    "this brings mildly cn - cycled material to the surface and , therefore , reduces the c abundance and enhances the n abundance with the constraint that the sum of the c and n abundances is preserved ( iben 1964 ) .",

    "we adopt [ n / fe ] = 0 ( clegg , lambert , and tomkin 1981 ) .    the inferred initial abundances are given in table 6 along with the observed values for the pagb stars .",
    "relative to initial values , the stars are clearly enriched in carbon and nitrogen , but oxygen has retained about its initial abundance .",
    "these are in line with our sketch of the expected changes : the carbon enrichment is attributed to the third dredge - up , and the nitrogen enrichment to the first dredge - up , and , as expected , oxygen is almost unaffected by the dredge - ups .    from table 6 ,",
    "the mean difference between the o abundance of the pagb stars and their inferred initial o abundance is 0.2 dex .",
    "given the possibility of systematic errors in comparing abundances derived from main sequence and pagb stars , this difference is compatible with the expectation that oxygen is unaffected by evolution from the main sequence to the pagb stage .",
    "it may be noted that a study of post first dredge - up red giants with metallicities similar to those of stars in table 6 concluded that oxygen was undepleted ( cottrell & sneden 1986 ) .",
    "there is evidence , primarily from the low observed and higher predicted @xmath1c/@xmath45c ratios , that predicted changes for carbon and nitrogen brought by the first dredge - up are less severe than observed changes .",
    "it is , however , expected that a red giant s nitrogen abundance will approach the sum of the star s initial c and n abundances . considering this , we list in table 7 this sum alongside the observed n abundances for the pagb stars . on average ,",
    "the latter are equal to the sum of the initial c and n abundances : the mean difference is less than 0.1 dex .",
    "this is certainly compatible with the idea that the nitrogen abundance of agb and pagb stars was unaltered by the third dredge - up and subsequent events .",
    "cottrell & sneden s analyses , however , do not fully support this conclusion .",
    "their carbon abundances show the expected underabundance , for the first dredge - up , especially if the initial abundances are taken from gustafsson et al .",
    "low @xmath1c/@xmath45c ratios reported by the authors clearly show that a first dredge - up has occurred . oddly , nitrogen was reported to be underabundant : [ n / fe ] = @xmath190.05",
    "was found in the mean .",
    "this is surprising .",
    "we suppose that this anomaly is either an artifact of the analysis and/or the assumption that [ n / fe ] = 0 is incorrect for the initial abundances .",
    "if , of course , [ n / fe ] @xmath51 initially , our conclusion that the first dredge - up accounts for the observed nitrogen abundances of pagb stars is invalid .",
    "the first dredge - up reduces the surface @xmath1c/@xmath45c ratio .",
    "cottrell & sneden s measurements give a mean ratio of 16 for their sample of mildly metal - poor giants .",
    "available determinations for the pagbs including our lower limit for iras 05113 + 1347 give higher values .",
    "these are consistent with addition of @xmath1c to the envelope of a red giant without exposure to the cn - cycle , which would convert some @xmath1c to @xmath45c and @xmath52n .",
    "thus , the @xmath1c/@xmath45c ratios and the nitrogen abundances support the idea that little of the @xmath1c from the third dredge - up has been processed by protons .",
    "carbon in pagbs is considerably enhanced relative to its initial abundance and certainly to its post first dredge - up abundance .",
    "the stars are clearly c - rich , i.e. , c / o @xmath2 1 . table 6 shows that c / o @xmath25 3 for iras 05113 + 1347 , and 2 for iras 22272 + 5435 .",
    "the sensitivities of the abundances to the atmospheric parameters are so similar for the carbon and oxygen lines that the derived c / o ratio can not be plausibly decreased to less than unity .",
    "we assume that fresh carbon was added through the third dredge - up events .    in summary , the c , n , and o abundances are compatible with the view that these c - rich pagb stars evolved directly from agb stars that were converted to carbon stars as a result of the third dredge - up .",
    "it remains to examine if the @xmath0-process and lithium abundances may be integrated into this picture .",
    "both stars are severely enhanced in @xmath0-process elements ( table  7 ) which we identify as a signature that the stars experienced an efficient third dredge - up in their agb phase . in this respect ,",
    "our pair of pagbs are similar to the other analyzed c - rich pagbs .",
    "models indicate that low mass agb stars run their @xmath0-processing in the he - shell with the neutron source @xmath45c(@xmath47 , n)@xmath48o . to provide sufficient neutrons , @xmath45c must be generated in the h - he intershell region by a slow mixing of protons into the he - rich layers .",
    "presently , the mass of @xmath45c in the shell at the onset of @xmath0-processing is not calculable from the first principles but must be specified as a free parameter .",
    "this free parameter is a controlling influence on the neutron flux .",
    "the higher the neutron flux the greater is the abundance of @xmath53 relative to @xmath54 @xmath0-process elements .",
    "this is customarily characterized by the ratio [ hs / ls ] ( luck & bond 1991 ) where we take la and nd as heavy-@xmath0 ( hs ) and y and zr as light-@xmath0 ( ls ) elements . the abundances of these four @xmath0-process elements are represented by several lines and available for all the c - rich pagbs .",

    "( 2001 ) also used the same @xmath0-process elements in their theoretical computations .",
    "the results would not be significantly changed if we adopted any other combinations of heavy @xmath0-process elements .",
    "the ratios [ hs / ls ] for 10 pagbs including the two pagbs studied here are given in table  7 .",
    "the ratio [ hs / ls ] varies with metallicity across the pagb sample .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure  8 . for comparison",
    "we show the model predictions from busso et al .",

    "the chosen value designated as st/1.5 for a model of 1.5 m@xmath55 by busso et al . offers a good fit to [ hs / ls ] measurements for @xmath0-process enriched stars over a wide range of metallicity .",
    "the model predictions offer a good fit to the observed trend set by the pagbs .",
    "two pagb stars ( iras  07134 + 1005 and iras  02229 + 6208 ) deviate from this trend and they can be matched well with st/3 model predictions",
    ". the models also account for the observed enhancements [ ls / fe ] and [ hs / fe ] .      at [ fe / h ]",

    "at the first dredge - up , the surface lithium abundance is reduced by a factor of about 50 , i.e. , @xmath56(li ) @xmath25 0.6 is predicted for red giants .",
    "shetrone , sneden , & pilachowski ( 1993 ) found lithium abundances from 0.3 to @xmath57 @xmath190.5 in old disk giants with [ fe / h ] similar to that of our pagbs and a low @xmath1c/@xmath45c ratio .",
    "hence , the pagb stars with @xmath56(li ) @xmath25 2.0 are very li - rich relative to their putative progenitors .",
    "therefore , the li - rich stars have either experienced lithium production , or external replenishment of lithium ( e.g. , engulfed a planet ) .",
    "production is possible by what is known familiarly as the cameron - fowler ( 1971 ) @xmath58be transport mechanism in which @xmath59he by @xmath47-capture is converted to @xmath58be and subsequently to @xmath58li by electron capture .",
    "the @xmath59he supply is partly primordial @xmath59he and partly the product of incomplete running of the @xmath60-chain in the outer parts of the low mass main sequence star .",
    "a high temperature is needed for @xmath47-capture on @xmath59he but a low temperature is needed for @xmath58li ( and @xmath58be ) to avoid destruction by protons .",
    "thus , lithium production is efficient only in a convective region / envelope with a hot base and cool outer boundary . in intermediate mass",
    "( 4 to 7m@xmath61 ) agb stars , predictions and observations show that lithium production is possible .",
    "this has been most clearly demonstrated for the most luminous agb stars in the magellanic clouds ( smith & lambert 1989 , 1990 ; plez , smith , & lambert 1993 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1992 ) .",
    "the great majority of these li - rich stars are o - rich , a not unexpected result because the temperatures required for @xmath47-capture by @xmath59he also ignite the cn - cycle which will convert carbon to nitrogen and convert c - rich material to n - rich material with a low @xmath1c/@xmath45c ( @xmath35 3 ) ratio .",
    "attribution of lithium production to intermediate - mass luminous agb stars implies that the li - rich pagbs evolved from stars with masses of about 4  @xmath62 , which is unlikely , although perhaps not impossible , for stars as metal - poor as [ fe / h ] @xmath35 @xmath190.8 .",
    "examination of the reaction rates shows that the time scales ( @xmath63 ) for destruction of @xmath59he and @xmath1c are similar over the likely range of temperature .",
    "the rate constant for @xmath59he(@xmath64)@xmath58be is approximately an order of magnitude greater than for @xmath1c(p , @xmath65 ) @xmath45n ( angulo et al .",
    "1999 ) but this difference is offset by the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "then , @xmath59he and @xmath1c are destroyed at about the same rate .",
    "unfortunately , the amount of @xmath59he that was destroyed to produce the observed lithium abundance is unknown because the efficiency of the conversion of @xmath58be to @xmath58li is not obtainable from the observations .",

    "provided that fresh @xmath1c is added from thermal pulses occuring during and after lithium production , stars can remain c - rich with a high @xmath1c/@xmath45c ratio yet present a lithium enrichment .",

    "certainly , conversion of these o - rich giants to c - rich agb ( and pagb ) stars will remove the lithium unless it is replenished from the @xmath68he reservoir .",

    "siess & livio ( 1999 ) discuss accretion by a 3 m@xmath61 agb star .",
    "these calculations suggest that surface lithium is enhanced by a factor of a few , a factor barely sufficient to account for the observed lithium abundances .",
    "although the parameter space of the scenario was not fully explored and other choices of agb star ( e.g. , lower mass and lower metallicity ) and accreted object may result in a higher lithium abundance , this scheme will have difficulty in accounting for the fact that a lithium enrichment is very common among the c - rich pagb stars .",
    "five of the 10 stars in table  7 have been reported to show lithium enrichment .",
    "spectra of the other five stars have been examined for lithium but the 6707  line was apparently absent . assuming a detection limit of 5 m  for the line we obtain the abundance limits shown in table  7 .",
    "all are consistent with either lithium enrichment or the low lithium abundance predicted for an agb star that does not manufacture lithium .",
    "our abundance analysis based on high - resolution optical spectra of iras 05113 + 1347 and iras 22272 + 5435 shows that these stars classified as pagb stars have the surface composition expected of a highly - evolved agb star : carbon and nitrogen enrichments ( relative to their presumed initial abundances ) are identified as products of the third and first dredge - ups , respectively , and a strong @xmath0-process enrichment is also attributable to the third dredge - up . an intriguing lithium enrichment may reflect lithium production from @xmath68he in the agb or pagb star .",
    "the two stars analysed in this paper seem typical of the sample ( now , 11 stars in total analysed ) of c - rich pagb stars .",
