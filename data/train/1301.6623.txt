    "supernovae of type ia ( sne  ia ) played a pivotal role in the discovery of the accelerating universe ( riess et al .  1998 ,",
    "perlmutter et al .  1999 ) , and are among the most reliable standard candles on cosmological distance scales ( sullivan et al .",
    "2011 , barone - nugent et al .",
    "however , a complete understanding of sn ia progenitor systems has yet to be achieved , even though credible models for such progenitors exist ( e.g. hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 , nomoto 1982 , hachisu et al .",
    "many methods have been developed to discriminate between proposed models , including the theoretical modelling of progenitor systems ( e.g. , han & podsiadlowski 2006 , wang et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the measurement of delay time distributions ( e.g. , mennekens et al . 2010 , totani et al .",

    "2012 ; see also greggio 2005 , 2010 ) .",
    "one approach used in constraining the nature of sne  ia progenitors is studying the correlation between sn  ia rates ( snr ) and the properties of the galaxies in which they form ( e.g. , maoz & mannucci 2011 ) .",
    "the environmental properties studied so far include redshift ( e.g. , dilday 2010a and 2010b ) , host galaxy age ( e.g. , gupta et al .",
    "2011 ) , environment galaxy number density ( e.g. , cooper et al .",
    "2009 ) , ejecta velocity ( e.g. , foley 2012 ) , and , most relevant to this work , mass and star formation rate of the host ( e.g. , sullivan et al .  2006 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the correlation between sn  ia rates and the mass and star formation rate of the host galaxies in which they formed .",
    "one popular model for this correlation is the  @xmath6 \" model ( scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ) , which states that the supernova rate is proportional to a linear combination of galaxy mass and star formation rate : @xmath0 , where @xmath7 is the sn  ia rate , @xmath1 is galaxy mass in stars , and @xmath2 is star formation rate .",
    "this relation leads trivially to a more physical relation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the rate per unit mass , and @xmath10 is specific star formation rate ( which is a function of star formation history , independent of mass ) .",
    "substantial effort has been invested in determining the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 since the work of scannapieco and bildsten ( 2005 ) .",
    "[ litcomp ] for a comparison of some of these results .",
    "neill et al . ( 2006 ) and dilday et al . ( 2008 ) used volumetric sn  ia rates to infer these parameters .",
    "of particular interest is the work of sullivan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who obtained stellar masses and sfrs of each individual host ( and field ) galaxy by fitting pegase2 spectral templates to multiband photometry ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 , le borgne and rocca - volmerange 2002 ) .",
    "they concluded that @xmath13 , @xmath14yr@xmath5 , values that we will return to .    on the other hand , smith et al .",
    "( 2012 ) used photometric masses and sfr s to demonstrate that the @xmath6 model was not a good match to sdss - ii supernova data ( frieman et al .",
    "they proposed an alternate model of the form @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this is , on the surface , broadly consistent with the mass dependence found by li et al .",
    "( 2011 ) from the lick observatory supernova survey ( loss ) ( though see  6 ) .",
    "the primary objective of this work is to obtain fits to snr models using _ spectroscopically_-determined masses and sfrs from the sdss dr7 mpa / jhu value - added catalog ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 , brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 , tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) , making these values somewhat independent of , and possibly more reliable than , those based on multiband photometric data .",
    "this is of significance since it has been pointed out ( e.g. , frster et al .",
    "2006 ) that the uncertainty in measurements of star formation histories is an important limiting factor in the determination of the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , we use a new fitting algorithm for @xmath11 and @xmath12 based on maximum likelihood , which is more reliable than previous fitting methods .    in  2 , we present the data samples we use in our studies , which include the sample of sne  ia , the sample of photometric galaxies , and the subset of spectroscopic galaxies ( itself a subset of the photometric sample ) .",
    "also presented in  2 is the essential preprocessing of the data , most notably the matching of the sne  ia to their host galaxies in the photometric sample , and a brief introduction to the mpa / jhu masses and sfrs , in addition to a comparison with other masses and sfrs .",
    "our results for @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given in  3 , and a detailed examination of the fit of the model to the data is given in  4 .",
    "finally we discuss alternate models in  5 , and the implications of these alternate models in  6 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , abazajian et al .",

    "supernova identifications were taken from the sdss - ii supernova survey , which is a 3-year ( 2005 - 2007 ) survey conducted within stripe 82 of the sdss .",
    "stripe 82 covers an area of nearly 300 square degrees in a belt along the celestial equator , and contains @xmath1820,000 of the spectroscopic galaxies mentioned above . for each year",
    "the survey was conducted , supernova imaging was conducted for 3 months , resulting in a total observation period of 9 months .      from the complete sample of 660 sdss ii supernovae ( frieman et al .",
    "2008 ) , we extract 520 spectroscopically confirmed sne  ia , 503 of which were observed during the 3 observation seasons in 2005 , 2006 and 2007 .",
    "( for the rest of this paper ,  sne \" refers to sne  ia unless stated otherwise . )",
    "our sample is larger than that used by smith et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , since we include sne within @xmath19 .",
    "we omit 17 sne observed in 2004 , since the observation windows and completeness of these sne would be hard to gauge .",
    "dilday et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) have shown that the identification efficiency @xmath20 in the sdss - ii supernova survey is @xmath21 out to a redshift of 0.15 , and @xmath220.5 out to z=0.25 ( e.g. fig .",
    "8 of dilday et al .",
    "in fact the median z of sn in our ( spectroscopic host ) sample is much lower ( @xmath23 ) than for the sdss sn ia sample as a whole ( @xmath24 ) because of the severe magnitude limit @xmath25 for the spectroscopic sample of hosts .",
    "thus incompleteness @xmath26 appears to be a reasonable assumption .",
    "we also assume an observation window @xmath27 months in length , and detection efficiency @xmath28 .",
    "the size of the sn sample is therefore assumed to be the intrinsic number occuring in the sky within a timeframe of @xmath29 year .",
    "this assumption is discussed further in  6.1 , but we note here that different values of @xmath30 result in a simple scaling of supernova rates , and hence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 values .",
    "the sdss dr7 mpa / jhu value - added catalog contains derived masses and sfr values for the spectroscopic galaxies , including 19987 galaxies in stripe 82 ( our spectroscopic sample ) .",
    "the mass estimates follow a methodology similar to that of kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , namely a grid search over a library of star formation histories ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) for the most probable mass - to - light ratio .",
    "( this is slightly different from the approach of kauffmann et al .  ( 2003 ) , which matches @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but it has been shown that the mass estimates of the two methods do not differ by more than @xmath33dex . )",
    "the methods used for obtaining sfr measurements were similar to those proposed by brinchmann et al .",
    "galaxies were divided into three classes : ( 1 )  sf \" , ( 2 )  low s / n sf \" , and ( 3 )  agn , composite and unclassifiable \" .",
    "sf \" class was processed by fitting 5 emission lines ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , o iii , n ii and s ii ) to those of simulated galaxies in a spectral library obtained using the code by charlot & longhetti ( 2001 ) . for the ",
    "low s / n sf \" class , brinchmann et al . used a simple conversion factor between attenuation - corrected @xmath34 luminosity and sfr .",
    "the  agn , composite and unclassifiable \" class was processed by means of the empirical relation between sfr and d4000 .",
    "one problem with this methodology is that passive galaxies are always assigned a ( very small ) sfr .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2_1 ] , where mpa / jhu spectroscopic galaxies are plotted in the mass - sfr plane .",
    "it is demonstrated in  4 that this does not significantly affect our results .    to test the reliability of the mpa / jhu masses and sfr s",
    ", we compare their results with those of the vespa catalogue ( tojeiro et al .",
    "2009 ) , which estimates the star formation history of a number of galaxies in sdss stripe 82 using spectroscopic methods .",
    "vespa masses are obtained by summing the star formation history ; vespa sfr s are obtained from a sfh averaged over the redshift range 0 to 0.11 .",
    "a comparison of these quantities with their mpa / jhu counterparts is made in fig .",
    "[ fig2_2 ] . from this figure",
    ", it can be seen that the mass and sfr estimates from the two catalogues are in reasonable agreement with each other , with offsets of 0.25 and 0.24 for log m and log sfr , and rms scatter of 0.18 dex and 0.48 dex , respectively .    at this point",
    "it is relevant to ask how much better spectroscopically - determined masses and star formation rates are than their photometric counterparts ( as used by , for example , sullivan et al .",
    "2006 , and smith et al .",
    "the advantage of using spectroscopic data is due to several effects . 1 .",
    "redshift estimates ( required for both the sn and field samples ",
    "3 ) are much better for spectroscopic data . using the same sample as ours , smith et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that photometric redshifts result in negligible offsets ( 0.03 dex ) but a scatter of @xmath36 dex in log m and log sfr relative to using spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "2 . photometric methods for obtaining m and sfr from sdss data rely on fitting evolving stellar population models to 5 broad photometric bands .",
    "the simplicity of these models , coupled with the wide range of degeneracies between model parameters , will result in larger random errors , particularly for sfr . by comparison spectroscopic methods",
    "allow the use of far more data , including emission lines , absorption lines , and spectral breaks that are better tuned to the determination of m and sfr .",
    "3 . from a comparison of two different catalogs above",
    ", we have already seen that there are significant systematics in the determination of spectroscopic m and sfr .",
    "for all the reasons mentioned in point 2 , there are likely to be even larger systematic errors in photometric m and sfr measurements .",
    "these systematics are of the greatest concern ; none of our conclusions are affected by random errors in m and sfr .",
    "we adopt the host matching algorithm of sullivan et al .",
    "we use sdss dr7 @xmath37 band data to calculate a dimensionless parameter @xmath38 for every potential host - sn pair .",
    "@xmath38 is the angular separation of a sn from its prospective host , measured in units of the size of the 25 magnitudes / arcsec@xmath39 isophote , and allowing for the shape of this isophote ( see fig .",
    "[ r25 ] ) . the host candidate is then identified to be the galaxy with the lowest @xmath38 .",
    "sne  ia with redshifts falling more than @xmath40 from the photometric redshift of the host galaxy are then discarded .",
    "using such a selection procedure , for hosts with spectroscopy , host z and sn z are always in agreement to a precision of 0.001 .",
    "how large can @xmath38 be without introducing significant contamination ? to answer this question , we conducted monte carlo simulations with randomly distributed artificial sn positions , keeping in mind that a majority of contamination is due to sne for which the host is not seen .",
    "we find that the contamination is @xmath18 8% when only sn - host candidate pairs with @xmath41 are identified as genuine matches .",
    "contamination could be larger if we were to take clustering effects into account , but such effects are hard to quantify . applying this criterion",
    ", we find 351 matches for the sne within the sdss dr7 database . of these , 53 are galaxies in the spectroscopic sample , with mpa / jhu masses and sfrs .",
    "it may be argued that since @xmath18 170 sne were unmatched , @xmath18 @xmath42 sne of the 351 could be random matches .",
    "we consider this number to be relatively small in comparison to the 351 matches .",
    "also , this contamination estimate corresponds to the expected contamination from using @xmath38 alone as matching criteria .",
    "the additional redshift constraints would help further lower the number of random matches .",
    "the question of contamination is re - examined in  6.2 .    to test the host - matching procedure above",
    ", we use 2 separate methods .",
    "the first is to visually examine the images of the sn - host pairs , relative to their @xmath43 isophotes .",
    "the second is to plot the number of sn matches versus the @xmath38 criterion adopted ( fig .",
    "[ fig2_6 ] ) .",
    "we can see that there is a flat region beyond @xmath44 , which we assume to be the regime where random matches between sne and non - host galaxies become dominant .",
    "we also compare the discrepancies between our host - matching method and the  closest angular distance \" matching method used by many other authors ( e.g. mcgee and balogh 2010 ) .",
    "we find that the two matching methods give different results for @xmath1810% of the sne .",
    "we adopt a fitting algorithm based on maximum likelihood . using poisson probabilities , the likelihoods of a galaxy hosting / not hosting a sn  ia are @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the expected sn  ia rate for each galaxy within our observing window , calculated for every galaxy individually by means of the mass and sfr data .",
    "( none of the hosts in our sample hosted more than one sn . )",
    "multiplying these likelihoods for every galaxy , we obtain a log likelihood of obtaining our dataset of @xmath47 where 53 is the number of galaxies hosting sne , and 19987 is the total number of galaxies in our stripe 82 spectroscopic sample .",
    "we perform a grid search to find the maximum likelihood @xmath11 and @xmath12 values , which are @xmath48 and @xmath49yr@xmath5 .",
    "[ fig3_1 ] plots the probability contours and error bars for our grid search , while fig .",
    "[ fig3_2 ] compares these results with the observed snr at different specific sfr ( where specific sfr @xmath50 )    while exceptionally simple , the maximum likelihood analytical method above does have the drawback that it neglects statistical uncertainties in the determination of m and sfr .",
    "the method could be modified to include the effects of these uncertainties , however , given our conclusion (  4 ) that the a+b model is not valid , we have chosen instead to simply simulate the effects of these uncertainties .",
    "we have conducted a set of monte carlo simulations by seeding random , artificial sne into the spectroscopic sample , and have included the effects of uncertainties in m and sfr .",
    "we find that a and b are biased by + 0.05 and -0.05 when the effects of uncertainties in m and sfr are included .",
    "( this bias is in the sense `` derived value minus true value '' . )",
    "the mass term and the sfr term contribute 27 and 26 sne ia respectively , implying that there are as many prompt sne ia as delayed sne ia according to the model .",

    "[ litcomp ] .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 values above are optimal in a maximum likelihood sense .",
    "however , there is no guarantee that the @xmath6 model provides a good fit to our data ; more tests are needed .    as a test of the @xmath6 model s consistency",
    ", we rank the spectroscopic galaxy sample of 19987 galaxies by mass , calculate the cumulative percentage distribution of snr for both the @xmath6 model and the observations , and apply a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to the two distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig4_1 ] ) . the @xmath6 model with our derived values for @xmath11 and @xmath12",

    "[ fig4_1 ] ) the cumulative distribution functions of our galaxies for both an @xmath11-only model ( snr=@xmath51 m ) and a @xmath12-only model ( snr=@xmath52sfr ) , keeping in mind that any set of values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 must fall between these two distributions .",
    "( note that for the @xmath11-only and @xmath12-only models , the values taken for @xmath11 and @xmath12 do not affect the result of the k - s test . )",
    "the @xmath11-only model is rejected at an even higher degree , while the @xmath12-only model passes the test ( @xmath18 50% rejection ) .",
    "this shows that our data do not support a larger value of @xmath11/@xmath12 .",

    "[ fig4_8 ] ) .",
    "this means that a smaller value of @xmath11/@xmath12 will not pass the test . since we already know that a larger @xmath11/@xmath12 value will not work ( see above )",
    ", we conclude from these tests that _ no @xmath6 model can match our observed data_. the results of these ks tests are shown in table [ abalpha ] .",
    "the ks test is usually valid only when the measurement uncertainties in the observed sample are small .",
    "therefore the ( possibly significant ) uncertainties in the mass and sfr measurements brings the validity of our above methods into question . in order to check the validity of our k - s test under such conditions",
    ", we use a monte carlo approach .",
    "we generate many artificial samples of supernovae using the best fit a and b values with the sample of 19987 observed m and sfr values , add the effects of uncertainties in m and sfr , and generate cumulative distributions of log m and log sfr .",
    "the results are completely consistent with the k - s tests : the a+b model is rejected at @xmath2299% probability for log m and @xmath2297% probability for log sfr .",
    "the maximum likelihood method for fitting a and b returns a probability which can be used as a measure of goodness of fit .",
    "this probability can be interpreted using monte carlo simulations . allowing for the fact that this probability depends on the number of supernovae generated ( which varies from run to run )",
    ", we find that more than 99.9% of all simulations possess a peak probability greater than that of the best fit to the observations .",
    "thus we conclude , independently of the k - s tests , that the a+b model is not a good match to the data .",
    "to present an alternate , and somewhat more illustrative , view of this discrepancy , we separate the galaxies by mass into two equally - sized groups divided at log m=10.7 , and plot specific snr vs. specific sfr ( as in fig . 6 of sullivan et al .",
    "the resulting plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig4_2 ] ) shows that _ low - mass galaxies have a systematically higher specific snr than their high - mass counterparts , by a factor of 35 . _",

    "table [ abalpha ] summarizes the results for some of the many models tried .",

    "in fact high specific sfr implies lower m and luminosity ( brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ) and as a result the star forming galaxies ( log ssfr @xmath67 ) in our sample have an even lower mean z ( about 0.07 ) ; this means that incompleteness is even less of a problem .",
    "a simulation of an extreme efficiency variation with ssfr shows that , while @xmath12 will be biased , the main conclusion regarding the inapplicability of the @xmath6 model remains unaltered .",

    "could the progenitors of sne arising from the @xmath68 term ( @xmath71 of the total number of sne , @xmath72 errors quoted ) be due to a diffuse intergalactic stellar population , not accounted for in mpa / jhu masses ?",
    "sand et al . ( 2011 ) find that about 17% of the sne  ia in rich clusters occur in an intergalactic stellar population , a number that rises to almost 50% in groups ( mcgee and balogh 2010 ) .",

    "@xmath74 provides some mass modulation of the @xmath6 model , which we have already noted .",
    "we now turn to this mass dependence of the @xmath6 model , as seen directly in fig .",
    "[ fig4_2 ] , and also in the fits to the two @xmath1-dependent models in table [ abalpha ] .",
    "an effect similar to this has been seen before in the lick observatory supernova survey ( loss  li et al .",
    "2011 ) : sne  ia from loss possess a specific rate @xmath75 ( rather than the expected @xmath76 constant ) . in the case of loss , however , reliable sfrs were not available due to a lack of spectroscopic data , rendering it difficult to disentangle the mass - dependence of mean galaxy age or specific star formation rate ( e.g. schiminovich et al .",
    "2007 ) , which could produce some or all of this effect .",
    "in fact , a simple model incorporating ages from gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) explains the loss data rather well ( e.g.  3 of kistler et al .",
    "2011 ) , because low mass galaxies tend to be younger , and have higher specific sfr s , than high mass galaxies .",
    "mass - dependence of the simple @xmath6 model has also been inferred by smith et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who combine sdss sn  ia data with photometric masses and sfr s to derive @xmath77 .",
    "as already noted , however , this model fails the sfr - ranked ks test when their parameters are assumed .    in this paper the mass - dependence of the @xmath6 model",
    "is demonstrated in a manner that is different from , but complementary to , the methodology of smith et al .. first , we use spectroscopically - determined masses and star formation rates , which presumably should be more accurate ( though resulting in a smaller sample size ) .",
    "second , we visualize the mass - dependence in a non - parametric manner from a plot of @xmath9 vs. @xmath10 for two different mass samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig4_2 ] ) .",
    "note that this is quite different from the @xmath9 vs @xmath1 plot in li et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which includes galaxies with a wide range of sfr s , and hence may be affected by the mass - dependence of star formation rate ( though see below ) .",
    "third , we use the fact that an acceptable model must successfully reproduce the observed distribution of supernovae with mass and sfr , a fact that rules out most models that do not depend on mass",
    ".    how is this mass dependence of the @xmath6 model to be interpreted ?",
    "the obvious culprit is metallicity , due to the well - established correlation between metallicity and mass for galaxies ( tremonti et al .",
    "2004 , gallazzi et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "based on the environmental dependence of sdss snr , it has been suggested by cooper et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that the snr of galaxies may increase with decreasing gas - phase metallicity .",
    "kistler et al . ( 2011 ) note that for a given initial mass , the endpoint white dwarf is more massive for lower metallicity , a fact that may on its own ( and ignoring many other factors ) lead to an enhanced snr in low metallicity galaxies . we note that neither of these results constitutes a direct proof of an inverse metallicity - snr relation . theoretical models for _ single degenerate _ sne  ia in fact suggest the opposite rate - metallicity relation ( e.g. kobayashi et al .",
    "2000 , langer et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "an alternate , and somewhat more straightforward , interpretation for the mass dependence relates to the fact that the rate of sn  ia from a burst of star formation ( the so - called delay time distribution or dtd ) declines with time as roughly @xmath78 ( totani et al .",
    "2008 , maoz et al .",
    "referring to fig .",
    "[ fig4_2 ] , the median log mass for our low ( high ) mass sample is @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "thus , from the mean age - mass relation of gallazzi et al ( 2005 ) , and dtd @xmath81 , we would expect the rate to be about @xmath82 higher in the lower mass sample ( assuming that all stars within a galaxy form at the same epoch )  marginally consistent with what is observed .",
    "however , we note ( pritchet et al .",
    "2008 ) that a wide range of evolutionary models and composite stellar populations ( and hence mean stellar ages ) converge to a narrow range of loci in the snr / m vs. sfr / m diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4_2 ] .    while the initial mass function ( imf ) is generally assumed to be universal , recent evidence  both dynamical ( e.g. cappellari et al .",
    "2012 ) and spectrophotometric ( e.g. spiniello et al .",
    "2012 , ferreras et al .",
    "2012 )  suggests that massive galaxies possess steeper imf s , with a deficit of high mass stars relative to low mass stars ( see also kroupa et al .",
    "2011 ) . at a deeper level",
    ", this may well be a metallicity effect . since sne",
    "ia are exploding wd s , and since such wd s originate from main sequence stars as massive as 8 m@xmath83 , it follows that low mass galaxies are more efficient ( per unit galaxy mass ) in producing sne  ia .",
    "a detailed calculation of this effect is not yet possible because , among other things , it requires a knowledge of the efficiency of sn  ia production as a function of stellar mass .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that , for fixed total mass and a power - law mass function @xmath84 , varying the power @xmath85 by @xmath86 ( as observed ) around the salpeter value of @xmath87 produces a change in the number of sn  ia progenitors by a factor of @xmath88 ( depending on the mass range used ) .",
    "an imf effect therefore has some potential as a mechanism for the galaxy mass dependence of sn  ia rates .    finally , we note the recently discovered host mass effect on sn ia peak luminosities ( kelly et al .",
    "2010 , sullivan et al .",
    "a somewhat simplistic hypothesis is that both this effect , and the host mass modulation of supernova specific rates that we have found , are connected .",
    "both these effects could be caused by the presence of two distinct classes of sn ia progenitors , whose frequency depends on host galaxy mass through metallicity and/or progenitor mass .",
    "in summary , we have studied how type ia supernova rates correlate with host galaxy masses and star formation rates .",
    "our supernovae and host galaxies were taken from the sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample , which has spectroscopic measurements of masses and star formation rates .",
    "the reliability of the host sample was checked by comparing with vespa data .",
    "our primary results are as follows :    * we find that maximum likelihood values @xmath48 and @xmath49yr@xmath5 provide an optimal fit to our data for a generic @xmath6 model .",
    "this result is largely consistent with the literature ( fig .",
    "[ litcomp ] ) . *",
    "the @xmath6 model fails to predict the mass - dependence of the specific snr - specific sfr relation in our sample .",
    "we also show that _ no set of @xmath11 and @xmath12 can account for this discrepancy between the model and the observed data_. this result holds regardless of any uncertainties in the observing windows and completeness .",
    "* modifications to improve the @xmath6 model are tested .",
    "mass - dependent models perform well in the k - s tests .",
    "a number of explanations of these results exist .",
    "most promising is the galaxy mass dependence of mean stellar ages , possibly coupled with variation in the slope of the imf with galaxy mass .",
    "further work is needed to quantify the effect of these two mechanisms on supernova rates .",
