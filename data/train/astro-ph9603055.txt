    "ngc  3516 is unusual for a seyfert 1 in other respects as well .",
    "while as many as half of all seyfert 1 s show absorption by ionized material intrinsic to the source , characterized as a  warm absorber \" ( @xcite ) , the only seyfert 1 besides ngc  3516 with equivalent neutral hydrogen columns exceeding @xmath12 is ngc  4151 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in ngc  4151 , these variable columns range from 1 to @xmath13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and a similar range of variation has been observed in ngc  3516 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . extended x - ray emission has been seen in the nuclei of seyfert 2 galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but among seyfert 1 s the only examples are ngc  4151 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and possibly ngc  3516 ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  3516 is also one of the rare seyfert 1 s with an extended narrow - line region ( nlr ) having a biconical morphology ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . again",
    ", ngc  4151 is the only similar counterpart ( @xcite ) .",
    "this rare combination of strong uv and x - ray absorption and extended narrow - line emission suggests that they may be related phenomena .",
    "extended narrow - line emission in seyfert galaxies is commonly associated with photoionization by a collimated source of radiation .",
    "biconical morphologies are most often found in seyfert 2 galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and they suggest that our line of sight to the central source of radiation is obscured . in the context of unified models of seyfert galaxies ( see the review by @xcite ) , seyfert 1 s present us with a direct line of sight to the broad emission - line region ( belr ) and continuum source , whereas our line of sight in seyfert 2 s is blocked by a torus opaque from the mid - infrared to at least soft x - rays .",
    "if the torus collimates the ionizing radiation , then biconical morphologies should not be observed in seyfert 1 galaxies . given this line of reasoning , evans et al .",
    "( 1993 ) proposed that the uv - absorbing material on our line of sight in ngc  4151 , but not in the torus proper , might collimate the ionizing radiation .    although the strength of the uv and x - ray absorption in both ngc  4151 and ngc  3516 suggests that the two absorbing mechanisms are related , it is not clear how .",
    "kolman et al.s ( 1993 ) simultaneous x - ray and uv observations of ngc  3516 were inconclusive due to a lack of variability .",
    "common uv and x - ray absorption at much weaker levels in some active galactic nuclei has been successfully modeled with a single warm absorber ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the wide range of ionization states of the uv absorber in ngc  4151 is not compatible with the simplest warm absorber models ( @xcite ) .",
    "the similarities of ngc  3516 and ngc  4151 in their uv and x - ray absorption and in their biconical nlr s prompted us to explore the far - uv spectrum of ngc  3516 shortward of 1200   using the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) .",
    "our goal was to search for further evidence that uv and x - ray absorbing gas in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is related to the collimation mechanism for the ionizing radiation . to improve our understanding of the relationship between the uv and x - ray absorbing gas",
    ", we also performed simultaneous x - ray observations using the japanese x - ray satellite _ asca_. in this paper we present the far - uv spectrum obtained with hut .",
    "a companion paper ( kriss et al . 1996 ) discusses the _ asca _ observations .",
    "we observed ngc  3516 on two occasions during the astro-2 mission , once for 1518  s beginning at 5:35:34 ut on 1995 march 11 , and again for 2200  s beginning at 1:32:03 on 1995 march 13 .",
    "both observations were through a 20  aperture during orbital night when airglow is at a minimum .",
    "the basic design of hut is described by davidsen et al .",
    "briefly , a 0.9-m mirror collects light for a prime - focus , rowland - circle spectrograph . a photon - counting detector sensitive from 8201840 samples the dispersed spectrum at a resolution of 24   with @xmath140.52   per pixel .",
    "improvements to hut , its performance during the astro-2 mission , and our basic data reduction procedures are described by kruk et al .",
    "the raw data were reduced by subtracting dark counts , correcting for scattered geocoronal ly@xmath15 emission and subtracting airglow .",
    "we then flux - calibrated the spectrum using the time - dependent inverse sensitivity curves developed from on - orbit observations and model atmospheres of white dwarfs .",
    "statistical errors for each pixel are calculated from the raw count spectra assuming a poisson distribution and are propagated through the data reduction process .",
    "as there was no evidence for variability in the uv data , the two separate observations are weighted by their exposure times and combined to form the mean flux - calibrated hut spectrum of ngc  3516 shown in figure [ n3516uv1pp.ps ] .    to model the spectrum of ngc  3516 and measure properties of the continuum , emission lines and the absorption lines",
    ", we use the iraf task specfit ( @xcite ) .",
    "we fit the continuum with a power law in @xmath16 .",
    "the brightest broad emission lines ( o  vi @xmath17 , ly@xmath15 , and c  iv @xmath18 ) are well described by power law profiles while single gaussian components are adequate for the weaker broad lines .",
    "the power law profile has a functional form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ( c.f .",

    "single gaussian profiles are used for all absorption lines other than the lyman series .",
    "we allow extinction to vary freely following a cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) curve with @xmath22 .    to model hydrogen absorption in the galaxy and in ngc  3516 , we compute grids of transmission functions including transitions up to @xmath23 . using voigt profiles of varying column density and doppler parameter , we then convolve the transmission with the instrument resolution .",
    "galactic neutral hydrogen is fixed at zero redshift at a column density of @xmath24 ( @xcite ) with a doppler parameter of @xmath25 .",
    "a sharp , redshifted lyman edge is readily apparent in the ngc  3516 spectrum .",
    "neutral hydrogen intrinsic to ngc  3516 is permitted to vary freely in column density , redshift , and doppler parameter .",
    "our best fit yields @xmath26 for 1671 data points between 916   and 1800 (we omit a region from 1207 - 1222   surrounding geocoronal ly@xmath15 ) .",

    "this corresponds to a spectral index @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "this is rather steep , but it is not that unusual for a low - luminosity agn . for comparison ,",
    "the astro-1 spectrum of ngc  4151 showed a spectral index of 1.50 ( @xcite ) , the fos spectrum of ngc  1566 has @xmath31 ( @xcite ) , and the uv continuum of m  81 has @xmath32 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our fitted extinction is higher than the predicted galactic reddening of @xmath330.03 in the maps of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , but compatible with that expected using @xmath34 and a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous work based on iue observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have determined @xmath36 based on the strength of the 2200 absorption feature , but such a large extinction correction provides a poor match to our data  for @xmath36 , @xmath37 . to show the sensitivity of the data to the extinction correction , figure [ n3516uv2pp.ps ] compares the observed spectrum with power - law continua after correction for @xmath38 and 0.15 .",
    "the figure clearly shows that no extinction correction leads to a deficit in continuum flux below 1000  , whereas an extinction correction of @xmath36 produces an excess in flux at short wavelengths .",
    "we suggest that the apparent strength of the 2200   dip in the iue data is not due to extinction , but rather to the onset of broad emission from blended fe  ii at 2300  .    for the neutral hydrogen intrinsic to ngc  3516",
    "we find a best fit redshift of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath25 .",
    "this is blue - shifted by @xmath41 relative to the @xmath42 systemic velocity of ngc  3516 measured using the stellar absorption lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "the opaque lyman limit requires neutral hydrogen with a minimum column density @xmath43 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "its sharpness limits @xmath44 to less than @xmath45 at 90% confidence .",
    "the effect of the assumed doppler parameter on the shape of the intrinsic lyman limit is shown with an enlarged view of the lyman - limit region in ngc  3516 in figure [ n3516uv3pp.ps ] .",
    "the general weakness of the lyman absorption lines ( only ly@xmath15 and perhaps ly@xmath2 are detected ) gives an upper limit of @xmath46 at 90% confidence .",

    "the fitted absorption lines are summarized in table [ tab - hutabs ] .",
    "all tabulated features , except for ly@xmath2 , have a statistical significance exceeding @xmath47 .",
    "the error matrix of the fit is used to derive the @xmath48 statistical errors shown in the table .",
    "systematic errors of up to @xmath145% are likely to be present in the fluxes , and our wavelength scale has a limiting accuracy of @xmath49 . for ease in fitting ,",
    "some poorly constrained parameters were linked to others with better determined values .",
    "for example , the velocity offset and fwhm of the c  iii @xmath50 and the n  iii @xmath51 lines were linked to share common values , and the fwhm of he  ii @xmath52 was set equal to that of he  ii @xmath53 .",
    "any entries in the tables with identical velocity offsets or fwhm s were linked in a similar manner . since the intrinsic o  vi absorption is difficult to see in figure [ n3516uv1pp.ps ] , an enlarged view illustrating our fits to this region",
    "is shown in figure [ n3516uv3pp.ps ] .",
    "the o  vi absorption doublet straddles the peak of the o  vi emission line , and the sharpness of the line peak is largely defined by the flux escaping at wavelengths between the doublets .",
    "galactic c  ii , galactic ly@xmath2 , and intrinsic ly@xmath2 absorption all contribute to the deficit in flux on the blue wing of the o  vi emission .",

    "this lower ionization zone with low doppler parameter is potentially the origin of the optically thick lyman limit system , but the predicted column of neutral hydrogen in this model is only @xmath212 , a factor of 4 below the observed value .",
    "the multiple zones considered above span a range of @xmath11 in both column density and ionization parameter , and they form a nearly orthogonal set that makes it possible to consistently model the uv and x - ray absorption with separate regions of gas in very different physical states . for doppler parameters at the sound speed of the two high ionization zones producing the x - ray absorption ( @xmath213 in the lower ionization zone , @xmath214 in the higher ) , the predicted contribution of the x - ray absorbing gas to the ews of the c  iv , n  v , and o  vi lines is only 2030% of their observed values .",
    "the uv zones producing the c  iv , n  v , o  vi and si  iv lines have total columns with negligible impact on the x - ray opacity .",
    "since the x - ray absorbing gas is predicted to have a significantly lower doppler parameter than the gas producing the bulk of the uv absorption lines , high resolution spectra in the uv should be able to identify kinematic components associated with the different zones .",
    "several previous authors have suggested that the uv absorption lines and the x - ray absorption seen in some agn may have a common origin in belr clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , mathur et al . ( 1994 ) show that the physical conditions of the uv and x - ray absorber in 3c  351 are different from those of the belr clouds , with the x - ray warm absorber requiring a much higher ionization parameter than the clouds producing the broad emission lines . for ngc  3516 , voit , shull , & begelman ( 1987 ) argued that the observed absorption profile ( the c  iv absorption in the 1980 s was much broader and stronger than observed here ) required 1030 belr clouds along the line of sight and that photoionized c  iv could not be present in the outer clouds due to shielding by the inner ones .",
    "the lack of observed mg  ii absorption was another difficulty for models involving belr clouds .",
    "they concluded that the absorption must arise in optically thin , outflowing material with a density exceeding @xmath215 , given the observed variability , and that it could not be associated with typical belr clouds .",
    "our conclusions are similar , even though the absorption is now much weaker .",
    "the ionization parameter we derive for the broad emission - line clouds ( @xmath216 ) is an order of magnitude lower than that required by the x - ray absorbing gas , making it highly unlikely that the x - ray absorption occurs in belr clouds .",
    "@xmath216 , however , is similar to the ionization parameter we find for the zone producing the c  iv , n  v , and o  vi absorption lines ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "although these absorption lines and the broad emission lines share comparable ionization parameters , the total columns of the belr clouds are @xmath218 higher , as the broad emission line clouds are optically thick in these transitions , but the absorbing clouds are optically thin .",
    "this column density constraint is a poor one , however , because the belr is highly stratified , and there may well be a population of clouds that both make the absorption lines and contribute to the broad - line emission .",
    "the velocity distribution of such clouds would have to be rather peculiar , however , to project a velocity width of only @xmath219 along the line of sight from an ensemble with an emission line width of @xmath220 .",
    "we conclude that we still can not unambiguously establish the location of the absorbing gas , but it must be physically distinct from the broad emission line clouds .",
    "although we have described the uv and x - ray absorbing zones as discrete entities , it is quite likely that there is a broad , possibly continuous , distribution of parameters such as one might find in an outflowing wind , either from the accretion disk or from the surface of the obscuring torus . as discussed in the introduction , ngc  3516 is one of the rare seyfert 1 galaxies that shows an extended , biconical nlr ( see golev et al .",
    "1995 for the best images ) . among seyfert 1",
    "s , only ngc  4151 has such an extensive nlr with a biconical morphology ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the biconical morphology in ngc  3516 implies that our line of sight passes close to the surface of the obscuring torus as suggested for ngc  4151 by evans et al .",
    "the opaque lyman limit is another characteristic that ngc  3516 shares with ngc  4151 .",
    "these features are unusual in combination for a seyfert 1 , and their presence in yet another galaxy strengthens the case for collimation of the ionizing radiation by the absorbing gas .    the complexity of the uv and x - ray absorption that both ngc  3516 and ngc  4151 exhibit suggest that the inclination of the source relative to the observer may lead to the differences between these two objects and the apparently simpler cases considered by mathur et al .",
    "( 1994,1995 ) .",
    "the simpler warm absorbers with only high - ionization uv absorption lines may be viewed at higher inclination , further away from the denser medium near the torus .",
    "such geometrical differences may ultimately help us to understand the location and origin of the warm absorbing gas in agn .",
