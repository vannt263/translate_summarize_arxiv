    "the second parameter ( 2p ) problem in globular clusters ( gcs ) is a puzzling problem which challenges our understanding on stellar evolution and formation history of gcs ( see catelan 2009 for a recent review ) .",

    "2012 ) proposed that tidally enhanced stellar wind during binary evolution may affect hb morphology by enhancing the mass loss of red giant primary star . in this scenario ,",
    "the different mass loss for the progenitor of hb stars is caused by different separations of binary systems , and the number ratio of stars in different hb parts is affected by binary fractions used in the models ( see the discussion in paper ii ) .",

    "therefore , the motivation of this paper is to study the effect of binary fraction on hb morphology in details by considering the effects of metallicity and age under the tidally enhanced stellar wind .",

    "finally a conclusion is given in section  5 .",
    "the method used in this paper to obtain synthetic hb is the same as in paper i and paper ii .",
    "tidally enhanced stellar wind ( tout & eggleton 1988 ) during binary evolution was incorporated into eggleton s stellar evolution code ( eggleton 1971 , 1972 , 1973 ; see paper i and paper ii for details ) to calculate the stellar mass and the helium core mass of the primary star at the helium flash ( hereafter @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "then , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and a time spent on hb were used to obtain the exact position of the primary star ( e.g. , effective temperature and luminosity ) on hb in the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram by interpolating among constructed hb evolutionary tracks .",
    "the time spent on hb in this paper means how long a hb star has been evolved from zero - age hb ( zahb ) . since the lifetime of hb stars is weakly dependent on the total mass when helium core mass is fixed , the time spent on hb is generated by a uniform random number between 0 and @xmath2 ( rood 1973 ; lee et al .",
    "1990 ; dalessandro et al .",
    "2011 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath2 was set to be the lifetime of hb star with the lowest stellar mass among the constructed hb evolutionary tracks , which means that this star has the longest lifetime on the hb .",
    "all the hb evolutionary tracks were constructed using modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ; paxton et al .",
    "2011 ; see paper i for details ) .",
    "finally , we transform the effective temperature and luminosity of each hb star into @xmath3 colors and absolute magnitudes , @xmath4 , using the basel stellar spectra library ( lejeune et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) to obtain the synthetic hb morphology in color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "the parameters adopted in eggleton s stellar evolution code are the same as in paper i and paper ii .",
    "the tidally enhanced stellar wind during binary evolution is described by the following equation , @xmath5\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the reimers mass - loss efficiency ( reimers 1975 ) ; @xmath7 is the radius of the roche lobe ; @xmath8 is the tidal enhancement efficiency .",

    "the rr lyrae instability strip is defined by the vertical region of @xmath22 log@xmath23 @xmath24 in the h - r diagram ( koopmann et al .",
    "1994 ; lee et al . 1990 ,",
    "see fig.1 in paper i ) .",
    "the label , @xmath25 , is the number ratio of stars in different parts of hb , where @xmath26 are the number of hb stars bluer than ( or to the left of ) , within and redder than ( or to the right of ) the rr lyrae instability strip ( lee et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the label , @xmath27 , is a parameter to describe hb morphology of gcs ( lee et al .",
    "1994 ) , and it is defined as follows , @xmath28 where @xmath29 have the same meaning as described above .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is in the range of -1 to 1 .",
    "the value of -1 means that all hb stars settle on red hb , while the value of 1 means that gc presents a whole blue hb .",
    "therefore , the larger of the @xmath27 parameter , the bluer of hb morphology in gcs . for each synthetic hb morphology",
    "obtained in model calculation listed in table  1 , we obtain the value of @xmath27 to study the correlation between binary fraction and hb morphology in gcs .",
    "the results are given in next section .",
    "fig.2 shows the effect of binary fraction on hb morphology under tidally enhanced stellar wind . in each panel of fig.2 ,",
    "the horizontal axis is the parameter @xmath27 which is used to describe hb morphology , and the vertical axis is binary fraction .",
    "the synthetic gcs in each panel of fig.2 have fixed metallcity and age but different binary fractions .",
    "one can see that for the three top panels of fig.2 , in which synthetic gcs have a high metallicity of @xmath12=0.02 , though the binary fractions are different ( e.g. , from 10% to 50% in each panel ) , all synthetic gcs present a pure red hb morphology , and small or null effect of binary fraction on hb morphology is revealed .",
    "a similar result is also shown in the three bottom panels of fig.2 , in which gcs have a very low metallicity of @xmath12=0.0001 .",
    "all synthetic gcs in these three panels show a pure blue hb morphology regardless of the different binary fraction .",
    "this is due to the fact that metallicity influence hb morphology significantly at very high and very low metallicity , and it may mask the effect of binary fraction seriously .",

    "the green asterisks , red solid circles and blue plus represent the synthetic gcs shown in fig.2 at metallicity of @xmath12=0.02 , 0.001 , 0.0001 ( or [ fe / h]=0.0 , -1.3 , -2.3 ) respectively .",
    ", width=340 ]    [ fig3 ]     [ fe / h ] @xmath31 - 1.1 ) . , width=302 ]    [ fig4 ]    however , for the three middle panels of fig.2 , in which synthetic gcs present an intermediate metallicity of @xmath12=0.001 , one can see that with the binary fraction increasing , the synthetic hb becomes bluer .",
    "this result is more clearly revealed especially in the middle panel in which synthetic gcs have an age of 12 gyr ( e.g. , in this panel , with the binary fraction increasing from 10% to 50% , the value of @xmath27 increases from about -0.5 to 0.5 , which means the synthetic gcs transform from a dominant red hb to a blue hb ) .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation between binary fraction and hb morphology is weakened in other two panels in which gcs have ages of 10 and 13gyr .",
    "this result indicates that , age can also weaken the effect of binary fraction on hb morphology when gcs are very young or very old .",
    "the results obtained from fig.2 indicate that metallicity and age may mask the effect of binary fraction on hb morphology .",
    "however , for intermediate metallicity , when the effect of age is considered , our results reveal that higher binary fraction may make hb morphology become bluer .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in our scenario , when binary fraction increasing , more blue and extreme hb stars will be produced under tidally enhanced stellar wind ( see the discussion in paper ii ) . in the next section , we will compare our results with recent observations .",

    "( 2012 ) estimated the binary fraction for 59 galactic gcs by analyzing the number of stars located on the red side of main - sequence fiducial line .",
    "furthermore , they studied the relationship between binary fraction and hb morphology of gcs and found that there is a small or null effect of binary fraction on hb morphology .",
    "however , milone et al . ( 2012 ) did not consider the effects of metallicity and age on hb morphology when studying the effect of binary fraction . as we have seen in fig.2",
    ", these two parameters may mask the effect of binary fraction on hb morphology seriously .    in fig.3",
    ", we compared our results obtained in fig.2 with the observation by milone et al .",

    "@xmath32 means the region within one core radius of gc , and @xmath33 means the region between the core and the half - mass radius in gcs , while @xmath34 means the region outside the half - mass radius in gcs .",
    "therefore , the panels from left to right in fig.3 show the relationship between binary fraction and on hb morphology from outside region to core region of gcs .    to weaken the effect of metallicity on hb morphology ,",
    "we divide the observed gcs into three groups according to their metallicities .",
    "they are metal - rich group ( [ fe / h]@xmath35 - 1.1 , denoted by green open squares ) , intermediate metallicity group ( -1.7@xmath31[fe / h]@xmath31 - 1.1 , denoted by red open circles ) and metal - poor group ( [ fe / h]@xmath31 - 1.7 , denoted by blue open triangles ) respectively . in each panel ,",

    "one can see clearly that in each panel of fig.3 , the observed gcs in metal - rich group show red hb morphologies , while observed gcs in metal - poor group present blue hb morphologies .",
    "we can not find any correlations between binary fraction and hb morphology for observed gcs in these two metallicity groups .",
    "this is due to the fact that metallicity ( the first parameter ) can significantly influence the hb morphology at very high and very low metallicity , and it masks the effect of binary fraction ( even including the effect of age ) on hb morphology . in these two metallicity groups ,",
    "our synthetic gcs are consistent well with the observational data ( see green asterisks and blue plus in each panel respectively ) . however , for the observed gcs in intermediate metallicity group , at first glance , there is still no evident correlation between binary fraction and hb morphology ( see red open circles in each panel ) , which looks like to contradict with our results for this intermediate metallicity group .",

    "2010 ; dotter et al .",
    "2010 ) , and it may also mask the effect of binary fraction as we discussed in section  3.1 . for this reason , we studied the age of the observed gcs distributed in the intermediate metallicity group .",
    "fig.4 shows the relationship between relative age and hb morphology for observed gcs in the intermediate metallicity group ( -1.7@xmath31 [ fe / h ] @xmath31 - 1.1 ) .",
    "the relative ages of the gcs are from marin - franch et al .",
    "( 2009 ) which are defined as the ratio between cluster age and the mean age of the clusters in low - metallicity group .",
    "one can see clearly in fig.4 that , the hb morphologies become bluer with increasing age of gcs . especially for the oldest gcs ( located in upper right of fig.4 ) ,",
    "their hb morphologies are significantly affected by age , and they present nearly a pure blue hb ( e.g. , @xmath361 ) .    to weaken the effect of age on hb morphology , we show in fig.5 the relationship between binary fraction and hb morphology for observed gcs in the intermediate metallicity group by removing the oldest gcs ( e.g. , gcs with relative ages larger than about 0.96 in fig.4 are removed ) .",
    "note that , the total binary fraction of gcs in milone et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is obtained by assuming a constant mass - ratio distribution between 0 and 1 ( see section 5.2 in milone et al .",
    "2012 ) . under this assumption",
    ", it means that the binary fraction for @xmath370.5 is equal to the binary fraction for @xmath380.5 , and the total binary fraction is simply 2 times of the binary fraction for @xmath370.5 .",
    "therefore , the total binary fractions are dependent on the assumption of mass - ratio distribution .",
    "for this reason , the binary fraction used in fig.5 is for @xmath370.5 , instead of the total binary fraction .",
    "one can see in fig.5 that , though not very obviously , all the three panels present a weak correlation between binary fraction and hb morphologies , especially in the core region . with the binary fraction increasing ,",
    "hb morphology becomes bluer .",
    "we also study the effect of the binary fractions for @xmath370.6 and 0.7 obtained in milone et al .",
    "( 2012 ) on hb morphology in the intermediate metallicity group of gcs ( -1.7@xmath39 [ fe / h ] @xmath39 - 1.1 ) , and these binary fractions are independent on the assumption of mass - ratio distribution .",
    "the results are given in fig.6 and fig.7 .",
    "as in fig.5 , we also weaken the effect of age on hb morphology in these two figures by removing the oldest gcs ( e.g. , gcs with their relative ages larger than about 0.96 in fig.4 are removed ) .",
    "one can see that the relationship between binary fraction and hb morphology present in fig.6 , 7 is very similar to the one in fig.5 .",
    "the relative ages of gcs used in fig.4 are from marin - franch et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and we also do the same analysis as in fig.5 , 6 , 7 but using the age data from de angeli et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2013 ) respectively .",
    "the results for @xmath370.5 are shown in fig.8 and 9 , which are very similar to the one in fig.5 .",
    "one may be aware of that the value of binary fractions adopted in our model calculations ( i.e. , 10% , 15% , 20% , 30% and 50% ) are different from the ones obtained by milone et al .",
    "( 2012 , most of them are less than 10% ) .",
    "note that , the binary fractions in our model calculations are for the binary systems with their orbital periods less that 100 yr , but we do not know any information of orbital periods for the binary fraction obtained in milone et al . (",
    "2012 ) . due to this reason ,",
    "it is unlikely to directly use the binary fraction of a certain gc obtained by milone et al .",
    "( 2012 ) as input in our model calculations and then compare the results with the observation .",
    "however , the tendency that hb morphologies of gcs become bluer with increasing of binary fraction , though not very obviously in the observation , is consistent with our model calculation when the effects of metallicity and age are considered .    in a recent paper ,",
    "milone et al . (",
    "2014 ) defined two new parameters to describe the hb morphology , namely _ _",
    "l__1 and _ _ l__2 .",
    "they found that _ _",
    "l__1 , which is the color difference between red giant branch ( rgb ) and hb in the cmd of gcs , correlates with cluster age and metallicity , while _ _",
    "l__2 , which is the color extension of hb , correlates with the luminosity of gcs ( @xmath40 ) and helium abundance .",
    "milone et al .",
    "( 2014 ) also found an anti - correlation between _",
    "_ l__2 and binary fraction in group 2 and group 3 gcs ( see fig.10 in their paper ) , which seems to demonstrate that a higher binary fraction corresponds to a shorter hb extension .",
    "this result does not contradict with our results obtained in this paper .",
    "one can see from fig.3 in milone et al .",
    "( 2014 ) that more luminous ( i.e. more massive ) gcs present more extensional hb , hence a longer _ _ l__2 .",
    "meanwhile , more luminous ( i.e. more massive ) gcs also present lower binary fractions ( see fig.40 in milone et al .",
    "these results reveal that the anti - correlation between _ _ l__2 and binary fraction could be a result of the correlation between _ _ l__2 and cluster mass and the anti - correlation between binary fraction and cluster mass .",
    "the _ _ l__2 parameter describes the extension of hb other than the specific number of hb stars in different hb regions .",
    "that is why _ _",
    "l__2 is sensitive to the @xmath41 parameter ( fusi - pecci et al . 1993 ) and the maximum effective temperature of hb ( @xmath42 ; recio - blanco et al .",
    "2006 ) , while insensitive to @xmath27 parameter ( see fig.12 in milone et al .",
    "2014 ) which depends on the number ratio of hb stars located on different parts of hb . on the other hand , in our binary scenario ,",
    "different binary fractions would alter the number of hb stars in different hb regions ( see paper i and paper ii for details ) , hence it correlates with @xmath27 parameter .",
    "in this paper , we studied the effect of binary fraction on hb morphology under tidally enhanced stellar wind .",
    "we adopted five different binary fractions , i.e. , 10% , 15% , 20% , 30% and 50% , in our model calculations .",
    "our results revealed that for the gcs with intermediate metallicity and age , the correlation between binary fraction and hb morphology is clear . with binary fractions increasing , hb morphologies become bluer .",

    "we also compared our results with the observation of milone et al .",
    "we found that our results are consistent well with the observed gcs in metal - rich and metal - poor group .",
