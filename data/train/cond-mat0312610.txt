    "last years a lot of interest has been attracted by investigations of the nature of pseudogap states of high-@xmath20 superconductors ( htsc ) phase diagram .",
    "this area corresponds to lower concentration @xmath5 of holes per copper atom in the cuo@xmath0 plane and lower critical temperatures @xmath20 in comparison with the optimal value @xmath21 and the maximum temperature @xmath22 of the superconducting transition .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath20 values in htsc satisfy the following empirical relationship @xcite : @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "currently , the origin of the pseudogap remains unclear .",
    "proposed theoretical scenarios may be divided into two categories .",
    "one is based on the idea that the pseudogap is due to precursor superconductivity , in which pairing takes place at the pseudogap transition temperature @xmath24 but achieves coherence only at @xmath20 .",
    "the other assumes that the pseudogap state is not related to superconductivity per se , but rather competes with it .",
    "this magnetic precursor scenario of the pseudogap assumes dynamical fluctuations of some kind , such as spin , charge or structural , or so - called staggered flux phase .",
    "these two scenarios treat anomalies of electronic properties in underdoped htsc observed at temperatures both above @xmath20 and in its vicinity  @xcite .    in the heavily underdoped htsc , at @xmath25 a competition of pseudogap and",
    "superconducting order parameters develops most effectively and results in the peculiarities of the superfluid density @xmath26 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is well known that in clean bcs @xmath19-wave superconductors ( dsc ) the dependence @xmath27 is linear on temperature @xmath25 : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the superfluid density and the superconducting gap amplitude at @xmath31 .",
    "this dependence is confirmed by the measurements of the @xmath32-plane penetration depth @xmath33 : @xmath34 at @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the vacuum permeability , the effective mass and the electronic charge , respectively .",
    "the derivative @xmath39 at @xmath40 determines @xmath41 ratio .",
    "if thermally excited fermionic quasiparticles are the only important excitations even at @xmath42 , then the slope of @xmath43 curves at @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath44 ratio : @xmath45 .",
    "the measurements of @xmath46 in underdoped htsc showed that the superfluid density @xmath47 increases approximately linearly with @xmath48 reaching its maximum value at @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "when decreasing @xmath42 and hence approaching the dielectric phase , the role of electron correlations and phase fluctuations becomes increasingly significant .",
    "the generalized fermi - liquid models ( gfl ) allow for this through @xmath5-dependent landau parameter @xmath49  @xcite which includes @xmath50 .",
    "the values of @xmath51 and @xmath49 determine the doping dependence of the derivative @xmath52 . in ref .",
    "the ratio @xmath53 does not depend on @xmath5 ; the model  @xcite predicts @xmath54 . the measurements of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals  @xcite and oriented powders  @xcite with the holes concentration @xmath55 showed that the slope of @xmath43 dependences at @xmath40 is either slightly @xmath5-dependent  @xcite , which agrees with ref .  , or",
    "diminishes with decreasing @xmath56 ,  @xcite which contradicts the gfl models  @xcite .        in the precursor pairing model  @xcite of pseudogap , based on the formation of pair electron excitations with finite momentum at @xmath24 , the influence of pseudogap order parameter on the quasiparticles spectrum at @xmath57 leads to a rise of @xmath51 and decrease of @xmath50 with @xmath5 lowering .",
    "hence , the decrease of the derivative @xmath45 is expected .",
    "the @xmath58 dependences calculated in ref .   show that their low temperature slopes decrease with underdoping .",
    "an alternative behavior of @xmath39 follows from magnetic precursor @xmath19-density wave ( ddw ) scenario of pseudogap  @xcite . in this model",
    "a ddw order parameter @xmath59 is directly introduced into the quasiparticle band structure . at low energies",
    "the excitation spectrum of ddw consists of conventional fermionic particles and holes like that of dsc with which it competes at @xmath60 .",
    "the dsc gap @xmath51 steadily vanishes with @xmath5 decreasing , whereas the sum of zero - temperature squares @xmath61 remains constant @xcite . in the issue",
    ", the ddw model predicts a growth of the slope of @xmath58 curves at low @xmath4 and @xmath62 . at the same time",
    "the opening of pseudogap influences weakly the @xmath14-axis penetration depth @xmath63 of high - frequency field for currents running perpendicular to cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "in particular , strong decrease of the interlayer coupling integral @xmath64 with @xmath5 lowering  @xcite in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 dominates over effects of the ddw order on @xmath65  @xcite .",

    "@xcite for this particular case .",

    "let us consider now their possible manifestations in the doping dependence of the @xmath14-axis penetration depth .    from the inset to fig .",
    "8 follows that reciprocal value of the zero - temperature penetration depth @xmath164 is roughly linear on @xmath5 .",
    "note that it vanishes at @xmath165 which is near the value where @xmath20 does too ( fig .",
    "there are several theoretical models  @xcite and experimental confirmations  @xcite of the direct proportionality of @xmath166 to the @xmath14-axis conductivity @xmath167 in htsc . in the simplest theory",
    "this correlation is caused by @xmath168 relation , where @xmath169 is the @xmath14-axis critical current in the @xmath19-wave superconductor with anisotropic interlayer scattering and weak interlayer coupling .",
    "the value of @xmath170 is determined by both the superconducting gap @xmath131 and the conductivity @xmath167 .",
    "the symbols in the lower inset to fig .  9 show our data fitted by the dashed line @xmath171 = -0.48\\log\\sigma_c(t_c)[\\omega^{-1}m^{-1}]+2.08 $ ] .",
    "the latter constant defines a proportionality factor @xmath172 in @xmath173 relation . in the framework of ddw model the value of @xmath172",
    "is determined by the doping dependences of @xmath51 , @xmath134 and chemical potential @xmath174 . as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the opening of ddw gap can lead to increase as well as to decrease of @xmath172 .",
    "this depends on the position of fermi surface with respect to ddw gap , but in any case @xmath172 changes less than twice in the whole range of doping .",
