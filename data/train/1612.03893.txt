    "during last decades , great attention has been paid to distributed fiber optic sensing systems , which are of great importance for monitor of extended objects  @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising sensing technique is otdr  @xcite .",
    "standard otdr uses light sources with coherence lengths , which are much shorter than pulse lengths  @xcite .",
    "this can yield a sum of backscattered intensities from each scattering center , which allows one to reveal splices and breaks in fiber optic cables .",
    "@xmath0-otdr - based sensors work in an another regime  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the coherence length of lasers is longer than their pulse length .",
    "such systems can be used for real - time vibration control of extended objects , _",
    "e.g. _ , bridges , pipelines , national borders , and many others  @xcite .",
    "events near the fiber generate an acoustic wave .",
    "this wave changes the phases of the backscattering centers .",
    "an analysis of such signals can reveal their impact on the sensor and monitor located near fiber objects .",
    "an important issue towards to practical implementation of such systems is a development of event recognition algorithms  @xcite .",
    "a technique for probe pulse preparation is an important stage of operating of @xmath0-otdr - based sensors .",
    "this technique is aimed on both providing sufficient power of the signal and satisfying requirements on the probe pulses shape . to increase sensitivity of such sensing devices ,",
    "highly coherent narrowband lasers should be used  @xcite . however , this increases the cost of sensing devices significantly .",
    "thus , optimization of probe pulse preparation technique is an important step in development of @xmath0-otdr - based sensing devices  @xcite .",
    "practical applications of @xmath0-otdr - based sensors require sufficiently high power of source and large coherence length .",
    "another important ingredient is shape of probe pulses , which should be close to the rectangular shape .",
    "it should be noted that these requirements could not be satisfied by using proper semiconductor lasers only . a typical way to achieve",
    "this is to use following tools : narrow linewidth laser with large coherence length , edfa with high output power of signals , and acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) for providing proper pulse shape  @xcite .    at this moment",
    ", both schemes with edfa precedes aom ( _ i.e. _ , continuous mode edfa , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and schemes with their inverse sequence ( pulse mode edfa , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) are in use .",
    "we note that the pulse mode edfa scheme makes requirements to aom weaker  @xcite , since edfa in the continuous mode should be accomplishment by a special stabilization scheme giving rise to @xmath1 db stability level  @xcite .",
    "one of the key challenge of using of pulse mode edfa schemes is the fact that in this case the pulse shape is determined not only by aom , but also transients in edfa . in its turn , this leads to a distortion of the probe pulse shape . therefore , even if the input power is lower that the critical value  @xcite , the pulse distortion leads to possible appearance of nonlinear effects .",
    "thus , an interesting and important task is to find a regime providing both sufficiently large amplification of probe pulse power and adequately small gradient of pulse shapes ( not very large distortion ) for pulse mode edfa setups for @xmath0-otdr - based sensors .",
    "this could provide a cost - effective solution , which allows one pushing frontiers of applications of @xmath0-otdr - based sensors forward and explore new markets .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate experimental results on the use of a low - cost narrowband ( @xmath2 khz ) semiconductor laser diode with pulse mode edfa for probe pulses preparation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "we show that nonlinear effects could appear due to the distortion of shape of probe pulses even below the critical value of power for our setup  @xcite .",
    "this is realized by measurements of pulse shape dependences on pump power , pulse duration , and pulse repetition frequency .",
    "we then find a regime , which allows avoiding nonlinear effect and providing sufficient sensibility .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , we study influences of nonlinear effects due to the pulse shape distortion on operating of the @xmath0-otdr - based sensor . in sec .  [ sec : numerics ] , we implement a numerical analysis of influences of the probe pulse shape on resulting data from our @xmath0-otdr - based sensing setup .",
    "we conclude and summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "-otdr - based sensor with pulse mode edfa : signal from a continuous - wave laser enters to the aom .",
    "the resulting pulse of output power is launched into a fiber.,title=\"fig : \" ] -4 mm    our setup for investigation of influences of nonlinear effects due to the pulse shape distortion on operating of the @xmath0-otdr - based sensor is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "a signal from the continuous - wave laser ( wavelength is @xmath3 nm and output power is about 10 mw ) enters to the aom . the resulting pulse of output power about 150 mw",
    "is launched into the edf hp980 .",
    "the length @xmath4 is about @xmath5 meters . in our setup , the pin photodiode with known sensitivity at the signal wavelength is used as the receiver .",
    "the resulting data are reflectograms , _",
    "i.e. _ , space - time intensity distributions .",
    "we note that under certain conditions the leading edge of the modulated optical pulse in edfa depletes the inversion in an erbium fiber medium .",
    "this results in a higher gain than the trailing edge  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the waveform of the signal pulse is deformed during its transmission through the amplifier .",
    "in fact , this leads to the self - phase modulation due to frequency shift of backscattered signal  @xcite .",
    "-2 mm    it is rather well known that the self - phase modulation appears due to the power dependence of the refractive index in a quartz medium of a single mode optical fiber",
    ". the higher intensity of an optical pulse trailing edge encounter a higher refractive index of the fiber compared with the lower intensity of leading edge , while optical probe pulse passing through the optical fiber . in this case , the leading edge have a positive gradient of refractive index ( @xmath6 ) , while the trailing edge a negative gradient of refractive index ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "then the gradient of pulse power produces a time varying refractive index in a medium , which leads to time varying phase change .",
    "different parts of the pulse undergo different phase shift .",
    "thus , the optical frequency of the transmitted optical pulse are exposed to a frequency chirp .",
    "one can calculate the critical value of the gradient of probe pulse shapes as follows .",
    "the optical frequency shift @xmath8 can be presented in the following form  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the nonlinear refractive index , the effective length @xmath11 has the form @xmath12 @xmath13 is the effective cross section area , @xmath14 is the mode - field radius , @xmath15 is the incident optical pulse wavelength , @xmath16 is the dependence of an optical pulse power on time @xmath17 , @xmath4 is the length of the optical fiber , and @xmath18 is the attenuation coefficient . using parameters of our setup and eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , we obtain that the critical power gradient of optical probe pulse is @xmath19 .",
    "we start our experimental investigation from measurements of the dependence of averaging output power of the pulse on pump power at fixed pulse duration ( @xmath20 ns ) and fixed pulse repetition frequency ( @xmath21 khz ) . in order to obtain accurate results",
    ", we use the 99/1% coupler to avoid the saturation mode of the receiver .",
    "the experimental results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear]a .",
    "one can see that the pulse shape is deformed significantly at increasing of the pump power in erbium doped fiber .",
    "we then demonstrate the dependence of output power level on time for three different pulse durations : @xmath22 ns , @xmath23 ns , and @xmath24 ns at the constant power of the pump ( 20 mw ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear]b .",
    "the distortion value of corresponding pulse - shapes comparing to perfectly rectangle pulse - shape was 0.3% , 2.1% , and 3% for each pulse duration , respectively . on this step",
    ", one can calculate the values of the gradient for these three probe pulses .",
    "they are on the level @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "these values are below the critical value for our setup ( @xmath19 ) , which is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "it is important to study the dependence of the pulse shape and power level on the pulse repetition frequency as well @xcite .",
    "the experimental results on measurement of this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear]c . in this experiment ,",
    "the duration of pulse ( @xmath20 ns ) and pump power in edfa ( @xmath28 mw ) are constant , the pulse repetition frequency changes from 10 up to 100 khz .",
    "this frequency band is typical for operating of @xmath0-otdr - based sensors .",
    "here we study a dependence of the probe pulse shape on resulting data ( reflectograms ) from our @xmath0-otdr - based sensing setup .",
    "we use numerical analysis of receiving reflection data with two different type of optical pulse shapes : perfectly rectangle and distorted .",
    "the numerical analysis is based on the mathematical model suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . for numerical simulation of probe pulses",
    ", we also employ the simplified franz - nodvik mathematical model  @xcite .",
    "we use numerical simulation of reflectograms with varying the shape of probe pulses at fixed other parameters ( scattering center positions , amplifiers noises , laser wavelength and etc ) .",
    "the results are presented in fig  [ fig : data ] .",
    "the shape changes in 100 steps from rectangular to triangular as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data]d .",
    "we highlight high ( peak ) and low ( bottom ) sensitivity regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : data]e . for these two regions ,",
    "we calculate the decrease of the intensity of probe pulses as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the backscattering signal , the parameter @xmath31 describes the distortion of pulses ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath32 for a pulse of the rectangular form ) , and @xmath33 is the value of the backscattering signal ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath34 at @xmath32 ) .",
    "the form of probe pulse plays a crucial role for recognition procedures  @xcite .",
    "one can see that the resulting reflectograms obtained by probing the fiber by distorted and perfectly rectangular pulses ( for comparison of the distorted and perfectly rectangle pulses , see fig .",
    "[ fig : data]b ) are qualitatively the same , however they are different quantitatively . nevertheless , for obtained experimental distortion ( less than 4% ) it is not significant .",
    "one can also see that the decrease of the intensity in high sensitivity region ( 4 db ) is much higher than in low sensitivity region .",
    "therefore , it is possible to achieve a regime , which allows avoiding of the significant suppression of the intensity and providing the sensitivity for the system .",
    "we have demonstrated the setup for @xmath0-otdr - based sensing systems with pulse mode edfa . using obtained experimental and simulation results , the regime with avoided nonlinear effect and provided sufficient sensitivity has been revealed ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : data]c , fig .",
    "[ fig : data]d , and fig .",
    "[ fig : data]e ) .",
    "thus , the suggested scheme can be considered as a potential candidate for cost - effective solution for a @xmath0-otdr - based distributed sensor as a component of multipurpose monitoring systems  @xcite .",
