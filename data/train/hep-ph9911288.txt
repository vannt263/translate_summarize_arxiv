    "the large mass of the top quark suggests that the third generation may play a special role in the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "most models in which this occurs are based upon topcolor @xcite , which can generate a large top quark mass through the formation of a dynamical @xmath2 condensate , generated by a new strong gauge force coupling preferentially to the third generation .    in a typical topcolor scheme the qcd gauge group , @xmath6 ,",
    "is imbedded into a larger structure , e.g. , @xmath7 with couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) couples to the third ( second and first ) generation , and @xmath12 .",
    "the breaking @xmath13 produces a massive color octet of bosons , known as `` topgluons '' , which couple mainly to @xmath14 and @xmath2 . by itself",
    ", this scheme would produce a degenerate top quark and bottom quark .",
    "moreover , if the condensates were required to account for all of ewsb , and without excessive fine - tuning , then the resulting fermion masses would be quite large , @xmath15 gev .    to get the correct scale of the top quark mass one typically considers topcolor in tandem with something else , either an explicit higgs boson , susy , or most naturally with additional strong dynamics , as in `` topcolor assisted technicolor '' @xcite .",
    "however , another strategy , which seems very promising , is to invoke a topquark seesaw @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the topquark condensate does lead _ ab initio _ to a top mass of @xmath15 gev , but through mixing with other electroweak singlet , vector - like fermions the physical top mass is `` seesawed '' down to its physical value .",
    "again , it is the heaviness of the top quark that makes this latter scheme natural , and minimizes fine tuning .",
    "the top quark seesaw seems to emerge naturally in extensions to extra space - time dimensions at the tev scale @xcite .",
    "clearly , all such models require yet another component .",
    "indeed , a `` tilting '' mechanism is required to enhance the formation of the @xmath2 condensate , while blocking the formation of the @xmath14 condensate in all such schemes so that the b - quark is light while top is heavy .",
    "this tilting mechanism is constrained by the @xmath16parameter ( or t parameter ) because it clearly must violate custodial @xmath17    one way to provide the tilting mechanism is to introduce a neutral gauge boson , @xmath18 , with an attractive interaction between @xmath2 and a repulsive interaction between @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath19 boson of the standard model does precisely this and could itself provide the tilting , however the sm coupling constant @xmath20 is so small that one would be fine - tuning to achieve tilting in the presence of a large @xmath9 .",
    "hence , typically we introduce a new @xmath18 boson to drive the tilting .",
    "there are many ways to engineer the tilting with a new @xmath18 .",
    "obviously anomaly cancellation is mandated for all gauge forces , but this is not a sufficiently powerful constraint to uniquely specify the couplings .",
    "the simplest approach is to imbed @xmath21 in complete analogy to the topcolor imbedding , and each @xmath22 is just the appropriate weak hypercharge operator , with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) acting on the third ( second and first ) generation .",
    "this produces a topcolor @xmath18 , the @xmath1 , which couples strongly to the third generation and weakly to the first and second , and which , remarkably , can satisfy all of the constraints of flavor changing processes @xcite ( despite the loss of explicit gim cancellation ) .    in the present paper we will consider the physics in production and decay of the @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the standard @xmath1 discussed above , which we call model i , we will present three additional new models of the @xmath1 ( model s ii , iii and iv ) .",
    "we will find that the standard @xmath1 from model i has the lowest production cross section of the four models .",
    "although the standard @xmath1 could be found in this decay channel at the fermilab tevatron collider beginning in the next run , it is more likely to be seen first in the leptonic decay mode at the tevatron . models ii and iii are similar to model i but yield a higher cross section in the @xmath2 decay channel .",
    "the @xmath1 from model iv represents a novel class of solutions to the tilting problem .",
    "it couples strongly only to the first and third generation of quarks .",
    "this @xmath1 from model iv has no significant couplings to leptons .",
    "it is therefore leptophobic and topophyllic .",
