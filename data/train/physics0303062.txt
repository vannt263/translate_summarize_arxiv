    "the interactions between the ions and inner shell water molecules are much stronger than thermal energies and typically display chemical complexities even in the simplest cases @xcite . computational chemistry and the theories of solutions",
    "are approaching the stage that calculations on the free energies of ions in water must be taken seriously . despite this progress",
    ", there is still a non - trivial level of confusion about what is to be learned from experimental comparisons , particularly with comparisons developed from current experimental studies of ion - water clusters .",
    "this paper attempts to provide guidance on these issues by presenting a thermodynamic reconsideration of conclusions drawn from ion - water cluster experiments , and results of recent molecular calculations .",
    "computational results are presented for aqueous ions h@xmath0 , li@xmath0 , na@xmath0 , and ho@xmath1 which participate in a myriad of biological processes @xcite .",
    "these are common ions in aqueous phase chemistry , and this is especially true for h@xmath0 and ho@xmath1 .",
    "these species also play a significant role in current problems such as the speciation of beryllium metal in the environment @xcite or in the lungs . understanding beryllium speciation , and the development of beryllium toxicity , is of substantial technological interest , and",
    "would benefit from a molecular understanding of ion hydration phenomena .",
    "absolute hydration free energies , or equivalently single ion activities , that we wish to clarify are not measureable by _ purely _ thermodynamic means @xcite ; correct single ion activities will contain fundamental extra - thermodynamical information and hence their usefulness in thermodynamical analysis might be questioned .",
    "extra - thermodynamical , single ion activities , however , are not unknowable ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . furthermore , that knowledge would clarify the molecular understanding of ion hydration , and permit a compact , tabulated consensus of molecularly valid , experimental thermodynamic information",
    ".    the existing tables , for example @xcite , should naturally be consistent in describing hydration free energies for neutral combinations of ions , since those combinations are thermodynamically measurable .",
    "but the alignment of those tables depends on extra - thermodynamical information .",
    "an accurate determination of the properly defined single ion activity for any ion represented in those tables would be sufficient to align those tables .",
    "it has been pointed out recently @xcite that in favorable cases the inaccuracies of computed single ion hydration free energies could probably be made less than the misalignments in current tables of single ion hydration free energies .",
    "the present paper pursues this possibility further .",
    "because simulated extra - thermodynamical information is available from molecular simulations , it is possible to compute solely the work of coupling the ion with the solvent in its locality , _",
    "i.e. , _ the absolute hydration free energies of the ion separated from the contribution from the potential of the phase ( section ii ) . simulation results , however , critically depend on parameterized molecular models and on the treatment of electrostatic interactions .",
    "moreover , for many ions , particularly h@xmath0 and ho@xmath1 , the interactions with water are not easily described by convenient force - fields .",
    "this problem is circumvented by the quasi - chemical theory of solutions , within which the excess chemical potential of the solute is partitioned into an inner - sphere contribution , accounting for the chemistry in the inner shell , and an outer - sphere contribution .",
    "this latter contribution describes the interaction of the inner - sphere quasi - component with the rest of the fluid and can usually be well described by simple force - field models or dielectric continuum models .",
    "this quasi - chemical approach has been used before to treat ions , such as , h@xmath0 @xcite , li@xmath0@xcite , na@xmath0@xcite , and ho@xmath1@xcite .",
    "chemical reactions in solution , such as speciation of fe@xmath2@xcite and be@xmath3@xcite , are also well described .    in this article",
    "we bring together our earlier observations on the hydration of monovalent ions in conjunction with classical force - field based estimates of outer - sphere contributions .",
    "the results so obtained for neutral ion pairs are in good accord with experiments , but our single ion values differ consistently from current tabulations based on cluster - ion hydration experiments .",
    "our plan for this report is as follows : first , we define our problem and establish the notation we will use .",
    "we then discuss the experimental studies leading to current estimates of absolute hydration free energies of the ions .",
    "after that , we present the quasi - chemical theory and our computational results . finally , we return to analyze the experimental cluster - ion hydration results in this context . in the last section",
    "we identify conclusions of this work .",
    "we will consider the chemical potentials of ionic solutes in liquid water and we cast these chemical potentials in the form @xmath4 this treats an ionic solute m@xmath5 suggested to be a metal ion of charge @xmath6 , but the notation here will be extended naturally to anions x@xmath7 .",
    "the qualifier @xmath8 in eq .",
    "[ chempot ] indicates the macroscopic phase to which this chemical potential , or another quantity there , applies .",
    "thus , @xmath9 is the number density of m@xmath5 in a liquid water phase .",
    "( though we will be particularly interested in the case of liquid water as a solvent , other cases must be permitted also in the typical thermodynamic analysis . )",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is the electrostatic potential of the @xmath11 phase .",
    "this may be introduced on the basis of the principle that a mean electric field must be zero through interior regions of a macroscopic conductor at equilibrium , and we will use the language that @xmath10 is the _ potential of the phase . _ only differences in these potentials between phases will be involved , however , in our analysis .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is the thermal debroglie wavelength for the species m@xmath5 , a known function of the internal characteristics of an m@xmath5 ion , and of the temperature @xmath13 , but with no dependences of further thermodynamic relevence .",
    "( the standard state adopted by eq .  [ chempot ]",
    "is sometimes referred to as the ben - naim standard state . )    finally , @xmath14 is the object of the present study .",
    "it depends on temperature , pressure , and composition of the system . in the limit of vanishing solute concentration",
    "we will call it the _ absolute hydration free energy _ of m@xmath5 .",
    "we are principally interested in standard temperature and pressure conditions . as eq .",
    "[ chempot ] is formulated , @xmath14 depends on the energetic interactions of solution constituents , i.e. , the solvent and dissolved species , with m@xmath5 ions , and would vanish if those interactions were to vanish .",
    "that is also the case for the contribution @xmath15 .",
    "the separation imposed by eq .",
    "[ chempot ] is clear on the basis of our mechanical understanding of electrostatics .",
    "but from a thermodynamical view it is a _",
    "separation @xcite .    as a gauge of molecular structure and energetics of the solution in the neighborhood of an m@xmath5 ion , @xmath16 is worthy of interest .",
    "in contrast , @xmath10 reflects distribution of charge on the surface of the system , and is of less intrinsic interest because it is not sensitive exclusively to the local condition of an ion of interest .",
    "the goal is to separate @xmath14 from thermodynamic combinations such as @xmath14 + @xmath17 , to which the potentials of the phases do nt contribute , _ and _ to separate @xmath14 from @xmath15 .",
    "our notation here is deficient in one respect . for equilibrium of two conducting phases containing ionic solutes at low concentration , the potential difference @xmath18 = @xmath19 - @xmath20 across the phase boundary",
    "is not simply a property of the pair of solvents in contact with one another @xcite .",
    "( note that many materials can be considered conductors for sufficiently long times . ) from a formal point of view of macroscopic thermodynamics , this follows from the requirement that the bulk compositions of a macroscopic conductor be electrically neutral .",
    "more physically , the ions make a donnan - like contribution to the difference between the electrostatic potentials of the phases to achieve neutral bulk compositions .",
    "this potential difference does not progressively vanish as the concentration of the ionic solutes decreases , so it is not operationally avoidable by confining attention to low electrolyte concentrations .",
    "the difference @xmath18 , whatever its source , does not contribute to the thermodynamic combinations @xmath14 + @xmath17 .",
    "therefore an accurate evaluation of @xmath14 on any basis would avoid consideration of @xmath18 altogether .",
    "thermodynamic considerations will involve differences in these free energies and differences @xmath18 in the electrostatic potentials .",
    "if a dilute gas is considered to be the coexisting conducting phase , it is instinctive to assign the potential of that phase to be zero .",
    "no other considerations need be affected by this choice .",
    "it is then convenient to take @xmath21 , for example , to be the potential relative to a dilute gas phase .",
    "discussions of the difficulty of obtaining the absolute hydration free energy @xmath22 often begin with the observation that thermodynamic processes for bulk phases involve manipulation of neutral combinations of material .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to consider adding a single ion to a sub - macroscopic amount of solvent , for example @xmath23 for @xmath24 not too large .",
    "this leads to the consideration of ion - water cluster experiments as a potential source of information on @xmath25 .",
    "coe @xcite helpfully reviews that work .",
    "these experimental methods permit determination of a standard contribution to the chemical potential of the cluster on the right side of eq .",
    "[ reaction ] in a dilute gas , for cluster sizes typically including @xmath24=4 , 5 , 6 .",
    "it is helpful to keep in mind that these quantities can be targets of molecular simulation @xcite as well .",
    "we collect several relevant points about these quantities .",
    "a first point is that the standard chemical potential of such a cluster includes contributions from the kinetic motion of the ion over the interior of the cluster . for mesoscopic clusters ,",
    "this contribution may be awkward because the volume of the cluster accessible to the ion can be ambiguous .",
    "an extreme example of this ambiguity is the phenomenon , now well appreciated , that some ions might be localized on the surfaces of small water clusters .",
    "fortunately , the cluster sizes studied in ion - water cluster experiments considered here are so small that even the surface _ vs. _ interior question does nt appear to be a significant problem .",
    "a second basic point is that neither the experiment nor the typical simulation calculations further separate @xmath26 @xmath27 into an absolute hydration free energy and a contribution from the potential of the phase . this is natural because both of these contributions derive from intermolecular interactions , and in the case of simulations",
    "it would take a special separate calculation to evaluate the potential of the phase separately .",
    "our final basic point about the separation eq .",
    "[ chempot ] is that the difficulties in separating the various contributions to the interaction contribution to the chemical potential eq .",
    "[ chempot ] from physical data are not trivially simpler for a particular @xmath24 .",
    "though the contribution @xmath28 is expected to depend on @xmath24 , it will typically vanish neither for small nor for large values of @xmath24 .",
    "returning to the experimental analysis , we note that the conventional hydration free energies of ions are referenced to the case for h@xmath0(aq ) .",
    "so the conventional hydration free energy for the m@xmath5 ion is @xmath29 and similarly that for x@xmath1 is @xmath30 .",
    "following klots @xcite , we then form the following combination and obtain : @xmath31 the last two contributions in parenthesis on the right are _ conventional _ single ion hydration free energies and can be obtained from tables .",
    "klots gives a plausible procedure for obtaining the quantities on the left from the ion - cluster experimental results .",
    "_ if _ the quantities on the left of eq .  [ klots ] were obtainable to sufficient accuracy from cluster studies ( eq .  [ reaction ] ) , then eq .  [ klots ] could be solved for @xmath32 = @xmath33 , corresponding to the same standard state as for h@xmath0 in compiling the conventional ion hydration free energies .",
    "the evidence presented @xcite suggests that this procedure is successful to an interesting degree , and remarkably so for small values of @xmath24 . in view of those results and the analysis from eq .",
    "[ klots ] , we conclude that the values otained have not separated the absolute hydration free energy @xmath34 from the potential of the phase in @xmath33 .    in concluding this section",
    ", we return to consider the _ donnan - like _ contribution to @xmath35 that was noted above @xcite .",
    "this electrostatic contribution has its source in sorting of ions of different charges within the ion correlation length of an interface . though the source of this contribution is the ions distributed in interfacial regions , this contribution typically achieves a non - zero value in the limit of vanishing ionic contributions",
    "this contribution is present in the macroscopic description eq .",
    "[ chempot ] .",
    "but because the ion - water cluster experiments considered here treat clusters with only one ion that donnan - like ionic effect is nt present in those experimental data .",
    "in the quasi - chemical theory @xcite , the region around the solute of interest is partitioned into inner and outer shell domains . a variational check of this partition exists , if desired @xcite . here",
    "we treat the inner shell , where chemical effects are important , quantum mechanically .",
    "the outer shell contributions have been assessed using both a dielectric continuum model and classical molecular dynamics simulations .",

    "li@xmath0 @xcite , na@xmath0@xcite , and ho@xmath1@xcite , respectively . the free energy change for these reactions were calculated using the gaussian suite of programs @xcite .",
    "the @xmath39_n{}^{\\pm}}$ ] clusters ( and @xmath40 ) were geometry optimized in the gas phase using the b3lyp hybrid density functional@xcite and the 6 - 31+g(d , p ) basis set .",
    "frequency calculations confirmed a true minimum , and the zero point energies were computed at the same level of theory .",
    "single point energies were calculated using the 6 - 311+g(2d , p ) basis set .    * dielectric continuum model : * for estimating the outer shell electrostatic contribution , the chelpg method @xcite was used to obtain partial atomic charges .",
    "the non - electrostatic contributions are expected to make negligible contributions to the hydration free energy and are not considered further . then with the radii set developed by stefanovich et al.@xcite ,",
    "surface tessera were generated @xcite , and the hydration free energies of the clusters were calculated using a dielectric continuum model @xcite . with this information and the binding free energies for the chemical reactions , a primitive quasi - chemical approximation to the excess chemical potential of x@xmath41(aq ) in water is : @xmath42 where @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "@xmath44 is the equilibrium constant for the reaction in an ideal gas state , with @xmath24 of eq .",
    "[ eq : regrouped ] the hydration number of the most stable inner shell cluster , and @xmath45 .",
    "the density factor @xmath46 appearing in eq .  [ eq : regrouped ] reflects the actual density of liquid water and its effect is accounted for by including a replacement contribution of @xmath47 . a detailed statement on standard states and this replacement contribution can be found in grabowski  et  al .",
    "relevant energies are collected in table  [ tb : ener ] .    .electronic energy ( a.u . ) , thermal corrections ( a.u . ) to the free energy , and electrostatic contributions to the excess chemical potential ( kcal / mole ) using dielectric continuum ( dc ) approximation and molecular dynamics ( with tip3p and spc / e water models ) .",
    "the statistical uncertainties in the molecular dynamics values are of the order of 1.5  kcal / mole ( fig .",
    "[ fg : md ] ) .",

    "tawa and pratt @xcite went further , describing this ionization at different thermodynamic states .",
    "these are important works , but are not _ ab initio _ descriptions of dissociation .",
    "the reaction under consideration is the ionization of water ( in water solvent ) : @xmath49 the equilibrium constant for the reaction can be written as @xmath50 here @xmath51=1  m is the reference concentration for h@xmath0 and ho@xmath1 . @xmath52=55",
    "m is the reference concentration of water .",
    "@xmath53 is the partition function .",
    "@xmath54 is the ideal gas partition function , and @xmath55 is the widom factor .",
    "@xmath56 is the interaction energy of the solute with the solvent @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 is precisely the excess chemical potential obtained above using the quasi - chemical approach .    for the ionization reaction in gas phase ,",
    "the free energy change is computed ( using table  [ tb : ener ] ) to be 383.4  kcal / mole , which compares favorably with 384.1  kcal / mole estimated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the calculated @xmath48 s are 21.1 , 15.6 and 14.5 , respectively , for the outer - sphere contributions using dielectric continuum , tip3p water , and spc / e water .",
    "the agreement between the molecular dynamics results and the experimental value of 15.7 @xcite is excellent .",
    "from a molecular standpoint , the quantity of most interest is @xmath58 , the absolute hydration free energy .",
    "this absolute quantity is understood to be relative to the average potential of the phase , or equivalently to the value of that potential of the phase being taken as zero .    in the ewald summation method",
    "there is no interface , and the mean potential in the cell is zero .",
    "thus , use of ewald potential to compute charging free energies naturally conforms to computation of the absolute hydration free energy .    in a cluster , however , the reference potential is not zero .",
    "simulations of the vapor - water interface by sokhan and tildesley@xcite suggests that the potential in bulk spc / e water is -12.7  kcal / mole - e relative to the vapor value of 0 ( zero ) . adding this value to our spc / e estimate we obtain -256.7  kcal / mole for the hydration free energy of the proton in the presence of the potential of the phase .",
    "this greatly improves the agreement with the value of the value of -265.9  kcal / mole obtained by coe and coworkers @xcite and -264.3  kcal / mole obtained by klots @xcite .",
    "consistent with this but probably more significantly , the consensus results of table  [ ii ] suggest a value that is negative and somewhat greater than 10  kcal / mole - e in magnitude .    a classic alternative to the ion - cluster experimental studies for obtaining the absolute hydration free energies of ions is the tetraphenyl arsonium tetraphenyl borate ( tatb ) hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the molecular intuition is that these oppositely charged ions have the same non - ionic interactions with any solvent molecules .",
    "if it were precisely true that the absolute hydration free energy of these two solutes were precisely the same , then the donnan - like effects discussed above would imply @xmath35 = 0 at equilibrium of this salt between two coexisting fluids .",
    "if true , this would be a satisfactory solution of the present problem .",
    "but because the values obtained that way would not include a contribution from the potential of the phase , those values would be different from values extracted from the ion - cluster studies analyzed here .",
    "the computational testing of that tatb hypothesis has lead to energetic uncertainties of nearly the same size as the energetic contributions of issue here @xcite .",
    "therefore , the tatb hypothesis must be currently viewed as not satisfactorily proven .",
    "one important consideration is the following : because of the particular electrical asymmetry of water molecules , positively and negatively charged ions with exactly the same non - ionic interactions with water molecules will not have the same absolute hydration free energies .",
    "it is commonly observed in simulation that anions are",
    "better hydrated than cations of the same non - ionic interactions @xcite ; an intuitive view of that phenomenon is that water molecule hydrogen atoms , carrying some positive charge , are able to approach anionic solutes closely and this is different for the corresponding cationic solutes .",
    "our computed hydration free energy estimates , especially for ion pairs , is in good agreement with experiments .",
    "this agreement should not obscure the approximations made in applying a rigorous theory to practical calculations .",
    "these calculations might be improved in several respects .",
    "for example , in calculating the excess free energy of the cluster and the water ligand , we neglected packing effects and dispersion interactions .",
    "the tacit assumption in the analysis is that in composing @xmath59 ( eq .  [ eq : regrouped ] ) , errors in the cluster and the @xmath24 water ligands balance out . for ionic species",
    "this appears to be a good assumption , but it does fail for hydration of non - polar solutes @xcite .",
    "we foresee refining these aspects of the calculation in future studies .",
    "the neglect of packing contributions is probably more easily remedied ; see the discussion @xcite .",
    "packing contributions are expected to be only a few percent of the chemical and electrostatic effects included already . but",
    "those packing contributions are expected to be positive .",
    "those contributions would probably improve the agreement for lioh and naoh in table  [ tb : neutral ] . on the otherhand",
    ", several additional effects of comparable size would have to be included at the same time .",
    "for example , the effects of anharmonicity on the thermal motion of the clusters is a comparable worry .",
    "we find that the absolute hydration free energy , @xmath60 , is somewhat smaller than the acknowledged @xmath61 to @xmath62  kcal / mole span of numbers .",
    "the present analysis suggests that the more negative of these values include the potential of the phase , a contribution distinct from the absolute hydration free energy .",
    "calculations on ion - water clusters can be compared properly with experiments on ion - water clusters .",
    "those results and comparisons can test the adequacy of such calculations .",
    "but they do nt exclusively test the description of hydration of the ion ; part of those results derives from the surface structure of the cluster and that contribution does not vanish for large clusters .",
    "this study reinforces the idea that strenuous calculation of the absolute hydration free energy , @xmath63 , for a favorable case such as m = li could probably reduce the computational errors to less than the present experimental uncertainties .",
    "this would permit a more precise alignment of available tables of single ion absolute hydration free energies .",
