    "<S> a stochastic simulation algorithm for the computation of multitime correlation functions which is based on the quantum state diffusion model of open systems is developed . </S>",

    "<S> one of these models which was motivated by a dynamical description of the measurement process @xcite is the quantum state diffusion model introduced by gisin and percival @xcite . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> , the time - evolution of the wave function @xmath0 is governed by the ito stochastic differential equation @xmath1\\psi_t d t     \\nonumber\\\\    & + & \\sum_j\\left[{l}_j-    \\langle { l}_j\\rangle_{\\psi_t}\\right]\\psi_td\\xi_{jt},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a short - hand notation for @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the differential of a complex valued wiener process with means and correlations @xmath5 the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 acting in the hilbert space @xmath8 of the system are the free hamiltonian and the lindblad operators describing dissipation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the link to the density matrix description of open quantum systems is established  as mentioned above  through the covariance matrix of the stochastic wave function @xmath0 , i.  e. , @xmath9 the symbol e denotes the expectation value with respect of the stochastic processes @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion of the density matrix @xmath10 is obtained by inserting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sde_eq ] ) in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rho_psi_eq ] ) which yields the quantum master equation @xmath11    + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_j\\left [    2l_j\\rho(t ) l_j^\\dagger - l_j^\\dagger l_j\\rho(t)-\\rho(t)l_j^\\dagger l_j\\right].\\ ] ] this equation  or alternatively the stochastic differential equation ( [ sde_eq ] )  determines the time - evolution of one - time expectation values of system observables . </S>",
    "<S> multitime correlation functions which are of special interest in quantum optics or in solid state physics are not specified by these equations . in order to define these quantities </S>",
    "<S> , we will first define the matrix elements of some system operator @xmath12 in the heisenberg picture . in the density matrix approach </S>",
    "<S> , these matrix elements are defined through the quantum regression theorem @xcite as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the time - evolution superoperator corresponding to the quantum master equation ( [ qme_eq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the quantum regression theorem can not be applied directly to the stochastic wave function approach , since the initial `` density matrix '' @xmath15 is not necessarily hermitian , and hence it can in general not be the covariance matrix of some stochastic wave function . </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be resolved by extending the quantum master equation into a doubled hilbert space @xmath16 in the following way : we define a density matrix @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 are operators on @xmath20 and accordingly replace the hamiltonian @xmath6 and the lindblad operators @xmath7 by the operators @xmath21 in the doubled hilbert space @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> then we formulate the extended quantum master equation @xmath23    + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_j\\left [    2\\widetilde{l}_j\\widetilde\\rho(t ) \\widetilde{l}_j^\\dagger-    \\widetilde{l}_j^\\dagger \\widetilde{l}_j\\widetilde\\rho(t)-    \\widetilde\\rho(t ) \\widetilde{l}_j^\\dagger \\widetilde{l}_j\\right].\\ ] ] the crucial point of this construction is that each element @xmath19 of the density matrix @xmath17 is a solution of the original quantum master equation ( [ qme_eq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> consider now the initial condition @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an element of the doubled hilbert space @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> ( throughout this letter the superscript @xmath26 denotes the transpose ) . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the matrix elements of some operator @xmath12 are then given by @xmath27 by construction , the initial density matrix @xmath28 ) by a stochastic process for the calculation of its time - evolution and hence for the calculation of operators in the heisenberg picture ( a similar idea has been proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite appendix d ) .    applying the above procedure to the quantum state diffusion model we obtain for example the equation of motion for the wave function @xmath29 in the ito form @xmath30\\theta_t </S>",
    "<S> dt     \\nonumber\\\\    & + & \\sum_j\\left[\\widetilde{l}-    \\langle \\widetilde{l}_j\\rangle_{\\theta_t}\\right]\\theta_td\\xi_{jt}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix elements of @xmath12 are simply obtained as @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the expectation value with respect to the initial condition @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> note , that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ext_sde_eq ] ) is constructed in such a way that the norm of the state vector @xmath34 is preserved , i.  e. , @xmath35 . from a numerical point of view </S>",
    "<S> it is more efficient to drop this restriction and to work with unnormalized state vectors @xmath36 , whose time - evolution is governed by the quasi - linear stochastic differential equation @xcite @xmath37 accordingly , the matrix elements of the operator @xmath12 are defined as @xmath38 as a particular example , we consider a two - level system with @xmath39 coupled to the vacuum using the lindblad operator @xmath40 , and calculate the matrix element @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solution @xmath44 is readily obtained by integrating the quantum master equation . in fig.[fig1 ] we compare the numerical solution obtained using the scheme described above for @xmath45 realizations ( diamonds ) with the analytical solution ( thick line ) . obviously , both solutions are in excellent agreement .    alternatively , gisin proposes in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a similar scheme for the calculation of matrix elements which is based on the coupled system of stochastic differential equations @xmath46\\psi_t dt }    \\nonumber\\\\     & + & \\sum_j\\left[l - l_j(\\phi_t,\\psi_t)\\right]\\psi_td\\xi_{jt},\\nonumber\\\\    \\lefteqn{\\hspace*{-4em}d\\phi_t=-\\mathrm{i}h\\phi_t dt+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_j    \\left[2l_j(\\phi_t,\\psi_t)^*l_j - l_j^\\dagger l_j    -l_j(\\psi_t,\\phi_t)l_j(\\phi_t,\\psi_t)^*\\right]\\phi_t dt }    \\nonumber\\\\     & + & \\sum_j\\left[l - l_j(\\psi_t,\\phi_t)\\right]\\phi_td\\xi_{jt},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> these equations are constructed in such a way that the scalar product @xmath48 remains constant during the time - evolution of the system , i.  e. , the matrix element of the unity operator @xmath49 are calculated correctly for each realization of the stochastic process ( and not only in the mean ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , he also proposes in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a pair of quasi - linear equations , which could be used for the numerical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> however , although the above equations correctly reproduce the equation of motion for the matrix elements , the numerical integration of the stochastic differential equations for the system described above , suggests that these equations are not stable in general . in order to demonstrate this , </S>",
    "<S> we have also plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] the numerical solution of the quasi - linear stochastic differential equations for various step - sizes ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 realization each . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic deviation of the numerical and analytical solutions for @xmath52 is evident . </S>",
    "<S> we believe , that these deviations are due to the fact , that the solution of the deterministic part of the stochastic differential equation is unstable for this particular model which leads to immense fluctuations in the solution of the stochastic differential equation . note , that the fluctuations are even much larger for the integration of the `` unity - preserving '' equation  ( [ phi_psi_eq ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulation algorithm in the doubled hilbert space for the calculation of matrix elements in the heisenberg picture is the basis for the computation of multitime correlation functions such as @xmath53 and we propose the following procedure : start in the state @xmath54 and propagate it up to the time @xmath55 using the stochastic differential equation  ( [ sde_eq ] ) to obtain @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> define the state vector @xmath56 and propagate it up to the time @xmath57 by integrating the extended stochastic differential equation  ( [ ext_sde_eq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two - time correlation function @xmath58 is then given by @xmath59.\\ ] ] as a specific example we have computed the first order correlation function @xmath60 for a coherently driven two - level atom on resonance in the steady state with rabi frequency @xmath61 . to this end , we started with a random initial state vector @xmath54 drawn from a uniform distribution on @xmath20 and propagated it up to @xmath62 in order to reach the steady state regime . </S>",
    "<S> then we proceeded as described above . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the numerical simulation is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( a ) for @xmath51 realizations . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) where we have plotted the computational time which is necessary to obtain a given accuracy measured by the relative mean square error ( solid line ) and the estimated standard deviation of the samples ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results are compared with an alternative procedure which is based on an unraveling of the extended quantum master equation by a piecewise deterministic jump process ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm based on quantum jumps is about two times faster than the one based on the quantum state diffusion model . at a first glance , this result is surprising , since the individual realizations of the diffusion process are smooth and `` closer '' to the real solution . but this is outweighed by the fact that for the integration of the stochastic differential equation we have to draw two random numbers per time step and lindblad operator , whereas in the quantum jump method we have to generate only two random numbers per jump . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a single realization of the diffusion process is more accurate , but takes longer to be computed .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that operators in the heisenberg picture and multitime correlation functions can be calculated within the framework of the quantum state diffusion model by extending the stochastic differential equation which governs the time - evolution of the wave function to the doubled hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is in complete agreement with the quantum regression theorem . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have also shown that the latter fact is not sufficient to ensure that a particular simulation algorithm is of practical use : although the algorithm proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is in accordance with the quantum regression theorem , it seems not to be stable in general . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the scheme we proposed in this letter completely relies on the numerical stability of the quantum state diffusion model . </S>"
