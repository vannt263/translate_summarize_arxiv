    "only a few sources in our galaxy are known to be able to sustain luminosities close to the eddington luminosity . however ,",
    "in nearby galaxies many dozens of off - nuclear systems are known that reach luminosities greater than @xmath2 , the eddington luminosity for a typical black hole binary with a mass of @xmath3 ; some of these exceed this luminosity by orders of magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since these sources are significantly separated from the center of mass of their host galaxies , they can not be related to 7super - massive black holes .",
    "we refer to these extreme accretors as ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .    due to their high luminosity",
    ", it has been speculated that ulxs host intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which might provide important building blocks to form the super - massive black holes that power active galactic nuclei @xcite . in this case , and assuming accretion physics is largely mass - invariant , we would expect a power - law like hard x - ray spectrum , with a roll - over at energies @xmath4kev produced by comptonization in a hot corona .",
    "however , numerous studies have shown that most bright ulxs show a distinctly different spectral shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , in the _ nustar_era the high - energy ( @xmath510kev ) spectra of bright ulxs have now become routinely observable .",
    "such ulxs show a spectrum that seems thermal in origin , with a fast turn - over above @xmath6kev .",
    "the spectral shape of these ulxs is also distinctly different to the spectra seen in the sub - eddington accretion regime of most galactic binaries and active galaxies .",
    "they are therefore likely stellar remnants accreting above the eddington rate and typically assumed to black holes .",
    "however , in a surprising discovery @xcite found that m82  x-2 is powered by a neutron star accreting at super - eddington levels .",
    "recently , two more neutron star powered ulxs were identified through their pulsations : ngc7793  p13 @xcite and ngc5907  ulx1@xcite .",
    "ngc5907  ulx1has been reported to exhibit peak luminosities of up to @xmath7ergs@xmath8 , assuming a distance of 13.4mpc @xcite . however , the most recent distance estimate by @xcite puts ngc5907 at an even larger distance of 17.06mpc , which increases the peak luminosity to @xmath9ergs@xmath8 , and places ngc5907  ulx1among the extremely rare subset of ulxs referred to as hyper - luminous x - ray sources ( @xmath10ergs@xmath8 ) .",
    "its neutron star nature makes it a completely unique source , which apparently is accreting at about 500 times the eddington rate @xcite .    using _ xmm - newton _ , @xcite found that the spectrum of ngc5907  ulx1shows a tentative high - energy roll - over at about 5kev , in line with expectations from super - eddington accretion .",

    "we then calculate the inclination @xmath111 as :        this inclination is very high and makes it difficult to explain how we would be able to see the regions close to the compact object at all , as in super - eddington accretion the accretion disk is expected to have some geometrical thickness , blocking our line - of - sight .",

    "about 20% of the observed flux is pulsed @xcite , indicating that it is produced by the rotating accretion column of the neutron star . a lower flux from the disk , however , increases the estimated inclination further .",
    "another large systematic uncertainty in this estimate is the strength of the magnetic field , and the location of the hottest part of the disk .",
    "@xcite argue that a low magnetic field ( @xmath13@xmath119 g ) can explain the observed timing properties of m82  x-2 , which are very similar to ngc5907  ulx1 . with a lower magnetic field and a consequently much smaller magnetospheric radius",
    "the implied inclination would be smaller .",
    "in fact , in a face - on geometry ( @xmath120 ) we would imply a magnetic field of @xmath121 g for the inner disk radius to be at the magnetospheric radius during the bright 2014 observation .",
    "the 2013 observation shows a distinctly different spectrum than the 2012 observation , despite having a very similar flux .",
    "it also shows a significantly different spectrum than both the 2003 and 2014 observations , despite being located in phase between them .",
    "this behavior might be related to the fact that the 2013 data were obtained only 4d after the source s luminosity was below the detection limit of _ xmm - newton_and _",
    "nustar_(w15 ) .",
    "this remarkable drop in luminosity is clearly not related to the stable 78d - period , and so far has not been seen to repeat ( w16 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that it is caused by the so - called `` propeller effect '' or the centrifugal inhibition of accretion , where the magnetospheric radius becomes larger than the corotation radius .",
    "this regime can be entered if the ram pressure of the accreting material drops , leading to a further dramatic reduction in accretion rate and consequently luminosity . during such a state , the inner accretion disk",
    "would get depleted , and the slightly lower temperature measured could be an indication that the inner accretion disk was still in the process of refilling during the second 2013 observation in which the source was detected .",
    "w16 argued that the 78d - period is most likely either orbital or super - orbital in nature .",
    "the new results by @xcite indicate an orbital period of @xmath135d , confirming the super - orbital nature of the 78d period .    the physical origin of super - orbital periods is often linked to precession of the accretion disk .",
    "such precession could explain the observed regular flux variations without changes in the physical conditions of the accretion flow , as our viewing angle would change periodically ( as also postulated for the ulx m82  x-2 , * ? ? ?",
    "using the ratio of the ` diskpbb ` normalizations and the geometric effect that the flux is reduced by @xmath122 , under the assumption that the disk is relatively flat , we can calculate the required change in inclination angle @xmath111 .",
    "the largest variance in @xmath111 is required if we observe ngc5907  ulx1face - on ( @xmath123 ) during the bright phase .",
    "this would require an inclination angle of @xmath124 during the faint phases ( based on the 2012 data ) and a half opening angle of the precession of @xmath125 .",
    "this is lower than the precession seen in ss433 @xcite , which is often argued to be a galactic example of super - eddington accretion analogous to ulxs , but viewed close to edge - on such that the x - ray emitting regions are obscured from view @xcite . while a face - on view is in contradiction to the estimated viewing angle from the model normalization assuming a strong magnetic field",
    ", it shows that a varying viewing angle is a possible explanation of the observed flux changes for all inclinations .    while a precessing disk can naturally explain the differences in observed flux across the 78-day cycle , we need to understand how different spectral shapes can be measured at different viewing angles . from figure",
    "[ fig : parevol ] it is clear that the strongest spectral change is observed in @xmath25 . at super - eddington accretion rates it is expected that the accretion disk is flared up due to radiation pressure , i.e. , becomes geometrically thick and increases in size with radius .",
    "in addition a strong wind is launched , which is also largely optically thick @xcite and for which observational evidence has recently been found in ngc1313  x-1 and ngc5408  x-1@xcite .",
    "the observed temperature profile therefore depends on which parts and with what angle we observe the accretion disk .",
    "qualitatively we can envision a geometry where the apparent temperature gradient in the disk is changing as a function of viewing angle .",
    "detailed calculations of this model are , however , beyond the scope of this paper",
    ".    @xcite did not find pulsations in the 2012 and 2013 _ xmm - newton_observations and give an upper limit of a pulsed fraction of 12% .",
    "both these observations were taken at low apparent luminosities .",
    "if these changes are connected to real changes in accretion rate , the properties of the accretion column might change .",
    "for a lower accretion rate , as observed in 2013 , the emission pattern of the accretion column might be wider , resulting in a reduced pulsed fraction .",
    "we have argued that the low observed flux of the 2012 data is not due to a lower intrinsic flux , but due to a change in viewing angle .",
    "this seems at first difficult to reconcile with the disappearing of pulsations .",
    "however , it is also possible that the neutron star shows free precession , in step with the precession of the accretion disk ( e.g. , as discussed for her  x-1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the rotational axis at early super - orbital phases might be aligned close to our line of sight or , if the emission is axial - symmetric , close to 90@xmath126 , also reducing the observable pulsed fraction .",
    "it is clear that to understand super - eddington neutron stars like ngc5907  ulx1more observational and theoretical work needs to be done .",
    "for example , the currently available coverage of the phase - space is concentrated between phases 00.5 . for a detailed test of the proposed spectral evolution and model , broad - band observations at later phases",
    "are necessary , which can be obtained with _ xmm - newton_and _",
    "nustar_. ngc5907  ulx1is an ideal target for these studies , given the stable and strong 78d - period .",
