    "fig .  1 ( a ) represents a schematic of the stm measurements of the charge oscillations induced by an oxygen impurity embedded in the surface of fe thin films on w(001 ) surface .",
    "the resulting highly anisotropic charge oscillations are illustrated in fig .  1 ( b )  @xcite while figs .  1 ( c , d , e ,",
    "f ) illustrate the spatial modulation of the induced charge density at the fermi energy due to the oxygen atom calculated in the vacuum at a distance of 3.165    above the fe surface layer for different spin channels .",
    "details about the theoretical methods based on dft are given in the methods section and the supplementary note 1 .",
    "the fe films are considered in their ferromagnetic ground states but we point out that contrary to 1 ml fe / w(100 ) characterized by an antiferromagnetic ground state of the fe ml  @xcite , thicker fe films on the same substrate are ferromagnetic  @xcite . the fourfold symmetry of the anisotropic oscillations observed in the experiment is obtained theoretically and is notably pronounced for the majority - spin channel of 3 mls fe and much stronger than those of its minority - spin channel or those obtained from both spin channels of 2 mls fe .",
    "the majority - spin density oscillations in the [ 110 ] direction have the highest amplitude and survive the longest away from the impurity .",
    "these results imply spin - filtering in that the spin - nature of the oscillations observed experimentally are mostly of majority - spin type .",
    "as explained below , this surprising behavior is induced by the confinement effects in the fe films .",
    "qws of metallic films on substrates can be fully localized in the film .",
    "this naturally occurs for insulator or semiconductor substrates , since in the energy gap of the insulator there are no states available for interaction with the metallic - layer states .",
    "the states are then confined in the metallic layer , with small exponential tails in the vacuum region and in the substrate .",
    "however , localized states can also occur for metallic overlayers on metallic substrates .",
    "when the three - dimensional fermi surface of the substrate is projected on the two - dimensional surface brillouin zone , there can be regions that are not covered by the projected fermi surface .",
    "if the crystal momenta @xmath6 of bloch states with the projection @xmath7 of the overlayer fall in such regions , these states can not propagate into the substrate",
    ". then qws , confined in the overlayer , are formed at these particular regions of the surface brillouin zone .",
    "practically all metals have such @xmath8-dependent gap region .",
    "they are rather large for the bcc metals w , mo and cr .",
    "the projected two - dimensional fermi surface of w for the ( 001 ) brillouin zone is shown in fig .  2 ( a ) .",
    "in addition to the four - fold symmetries one sees rather large gap - regions along the @xmath9 directions , while states exist around the origin @xmath10 and along the x- and y - axis , i.e. along the @xmath11 directions .",
    "when we compare the electronic structure of ferromagnetic fe with the one of w ( or cr ) , we find that in the vicinity of @xmath12 the minority - spin fe bands are similar to the w bands , just shifted somewhat to higher energies . therefore , also the fermi surface of fe minority electrons is similar to the one of w ( or cr ) and the same is true for the ( 001)-projected two - dimensional fermi surface ( fig .  2 ( b ) ) .",
    "there are also rather big @xmath8-gaps along the @xmath9 directions and minority - spin quantum well states can not occur in this @xmath8-region .",
    "however , the situation is very different for the fe majority - spin states .",
    "there the projected fermi surface covers nearly the whole ( 001 ) surface brillouin zone ( fig .  2 ( c ) ) .",
    "consequently one expects that a thicker fe - layer shows quantum well states confined for @xmath13-values within those gap regions of w.    figure 3 shows the appearance of such quantum well states with increasing layer thickness .",
    "the two - dimensional bloch spectral function of the fe surface atoms at the fermi energy is plotted in the upper figures for fe layer thicknesses of 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 mls ( see supplementary note 2 and supplementary figure 1 for the case of an even number of mls ) .",
    "as one sees , the gap regions are filled with an increasing number of confined states , one state for 3 mls , 2 for 5 mls and 5 for 11 mls , etc .",
    "most important is that these states show nearly no dispersion , i.e. they are straight lines perpendicular to the @xmath4 diagonals .",
    "therefore the group velocities of all these states are focused in the @xmath4 directions .",
    "the lower pictures show the energy dependence of these states for @xmath13-values along @xmath14 , i.e. along the diagonal .    the majority of the states in fig .",
    "3 ( lower panel ) show a parabolic band structure . moreover , by increasing the layer thickness by 2 mls",
    ", one additional parabola is pushed down from higher energies below the fermi level , in order to accommodate the additional number of electrons . for small @xmath13-values",
    "the parabolic states are damped , due to the interaction with the w - states ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "however at the fermi level the @xmath13-values are larger and fall in the w gap - region ; thus the states are localized .",
    "in contrast to the majority - spin channel , surface states or resonant states can occur in the minority - spin channel but disappear below the fermi energy , where the experimental measurements are performed ( see supplementary note 3 and supplementary figure 2 ) .    the flat behavior in the fermi surface of the localized states in the surface brillouin zone ( upper panel of fig .",
    "3 ) can be qualitatively understood from the three - dimensional fermi surface of the majority - spin bands of bulk fe .",
    "if we consider a finite , but large number n of ( 001 ) fe layers in the vacuum , the @xmath15-values are basically quantized into n values and the two - dimensional fermi surface is a projection of n slices of the 3d fermi surface .",
    "the majority - spin fermi surface of fe has nearly planar areas in @xmath16 directions , such that the sliced fermi surface sheets result upon projection in nearly straight lines in the gap - areas .",
    "this trend can also be seen from fig",
    ".  2 ( c ) , where the two - dimensional fermi surface is the outcome of the projection of about 200 slices of the 3d fermi surface .      in order to understand the stm experiments for fe layers on w(001 ) , we have to discuss the friedel oscillations around impurities in metallic systems . using the stationary phase approximation , for large distances @xmath17 from the impurities the energy dependent charge density @xmath18 around the fermi surface",
    "is determined from points @xmath19 on the fermi surface , for which the group velocity @xmath20 points in the directions of @xmath21 .",
    "if for a given @xmath21 only one such @xmath6-value , @xmath22 , exists on the constant energy surface ( @xmath23=const . ) , then in three dimensions the energy dependent charge density @xmath18 induced at a large distance @xmath17 from the impurity is given by  @xcite    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the curvature at point @xmath26 measuring the flatness of the constant - energy surface , while @xmath27 is the component of @xmath26 perpendicular to the constant - energy surface .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are energy dependent quantities defining respectively , the scattering strength , the phase - shift that bloch wave functions experience after scattering and a contour related phase .    thus , if the curvature @xmath31 at the surface point @xmath26 is small , the density change in the direction perpendicular to the constant - energy surface is particularly large resulting from the focusing of the group velocities in this direction",
    "in fact , if @xmath31 vanishes , the charge density decays in this direction with a power smaller than 2 .",
    "if the curvature vanishes in a region larger than a single point , then the changes are even stronger : @xmath18 decays either as @xmath32 if @xmath31 vanishes along a line , or it does not decay at all , if @xmath31 vanishes in a planar area of the constant - energy surface . as discussed in  @xcite , often more than one critical point with group velocities @xmath33 parallel to @xmath21 exist , say @xmath26 and @xmath34 ; then the contributions from these two critical points are not just additive , but interfere with each other , so that three oscillation periods determined by @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 occur .",
    "the behavior of friedel oscillations in two dimensions are very similar as e.g. given by equation ( 1 ) , with the modification that the amplitude decays as @xmath32 only and @xmath31 is given by the second derivative of the constant energy line .",
    "coming back to the calculated 2d fermi surfaces in fig .",
    "3 we can connect the qws with the friedel oscillation .",
    "the group velocities of all qws point into the [ 110 ] direction , so we expect very strong charge density oscillations in these directions , as found for the 3 mls case by von bergmann et al .",
    "( fig .  1 ( b ) )",
    "@xcite and which is in agreement with our results in fig .  1 ( d ) .",
    "clearly only the majority - spin fe states give rise to this , since the minority electrons do not have quantum well states in the gap region ( see fig .  2 ( b ) ) .",
    "4 shows the calculated friedel oscillations along the [ 110 ] direction , for 3 mls , 5 mls , 7 mls and 11 mls of fe .",
    "firstly we see that the oscillations for 3 mls are strong and very long ranged , arising from the fact that ( i ) the oscillations arise from a quantum well state and that ( ii ) the curvature of this state is very small .",
    "moreover , due to the single qws , the oscillations reflect the periodicity determined by the different @xmath38 found on parallel flat parts of the fermi surface . the behavior for 7 and 11 mls shows a multiperiodicity arising from the 3 respectively 5 quantum well states .",
    "this leads to very large oscillation amplitudes , but due to partly destructive interferences also to an additional modulation structure with periods determined by the distance @xmath39 between the 3 , 5 , 7 , and 11 different qws . for thicker films these nodes shift to larger distances , as one would expect from the decrease of @xmath39 and increase of the film thickness .",
    "in general we expect that these oscillations , observed for 3 mls fe up to 5 nm , should be detectable for thicker films to up an order of magnitude larger distances . for 2 mls ,",
    "investigated experimentally  @xcite , the qws does not cross the fermi level and does not contribute to the friedel oscillations measured at the fermi energy .",
    "this explains the extinction of the charge ripples at large distances .",
    "concerning the minority - spin channel , we found that surface states and resonant states can occur which leads necessarily to charge oscillations .",
    "however , for 3 mls the minority - spin surface states disappear below the fermi energy ( see supplementary note 3 and supplementary figure 2 ) and thus do not contribute to the charge density oscillations . above the fermi energy ,",
    "oscillations are obtained but their decay is surprisingly much stronger than those obtained from the qws of the majority - spin channel .",
    "we find large focused long - range and large amplitude majority - spin density oscillations at the fe surface created by spin - polarized quantum well states of fe films on w(100 ) .",
    "our finding supports the possibility to design and control of quantum well states in supported thin layers that lead to a super - amplification of interaction effects .",
    "this may open new avenues of research by cross fertilizing communities working on quantum well states and on surface magnetism through the investigation of the charge or spin density oscillations along the directions parallel to the films .",
    "this can impact on the lateral coupling of magnetic nanostructures at the vicinity of the surface . for magnetic films ,",
    "in particular , there is a strong amplification of a selected spin component ( spin filtering ) which can be detected at large distances from embedded non - magnetic defects .",
    "this may have an impact in nanotechnology , since spin - information can be transmitted laterally to large distances .",
    "the choice of the substrate and the thickness of the film are of crucial importance in terms of their electronic structure to obtain a giant laterally focused signal far away from the imperfections located in the surface of thin films .",
    "many such systems should exist , making charge density oscillations in thin films of stronger importance than in bulk materials . as substrates the ( 001 ) surfaces of w , cr and mo are good choices , but",
    "also the semiconductor surfaces should be interesting candidates .",
    "for the film materials , metals with relatively flat fermi surface parts , like ferromagnetic fe , co and ni , but also pd and pt and even the noble metals  @xcite would be potential materials to create long ranged and strongly anisotropic charge density oscillations within the film .",
    "the calculations are based on dft . first , the atomic positions of fe atoms are relaxed using the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method within dft as implemented in the fleur package  @xcite . the relaxations favor inwards displacements of fe atoms along the z axis , i.e. towards the substrate .",
    "once the positions are known ( see supplementary note 1 and supplementary table 1 ) , the same type of simulations are repeated with the korringa - kohn - rostoker green function method  @xcite in its full - potential version considering a semi - infinite w(001 ) .",
    "the latter allows to avoid size effects using the decimation technique  @xcite .",
    "once the surface is simulated , the impurity is considered and the embedding technique based on green functions is used to evaluate the change in the charge density at different locations .",
    "we would like to thank kirsten von bergmann for pointing out her measurements , for discussions and for providing their experimental data .",
