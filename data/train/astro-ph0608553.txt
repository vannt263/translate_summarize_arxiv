    "the cosmic - ray spectrum extends from the sub - gev region to at least @xmath0  gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ) up to @xmath1  gev and somewhat higher , measurements with magnetic spectrometers flown above most of the atmosphere provide good momentum resolution along with identification of the charge and mass of individual primaries .",
    "measurements with calorimeters continue to identify individual primaries to beyond @xmath1  tev , but with larger systematic uncertainties in the energy assignment . in the pev region and beyond ,",
    "the cosmic - ray intensity is too low for direct measurements ; only indirect measurements of air showers from the ground are possible . since the particles are not identified on an event - by - event basis , the energy spectrum derived from measurements of air showers is given as an  all - particle \" spectrum , in terms of energy per particle rather than energy per nucleon . in the air - shower regime , identification of the primary mass is made in one of several indirect ways on a statistical basis , complicating the search for features in spectra of individual elements .",
    "the gyroradius of a proton in a typical galactic magnetic field of 3  @xmath2gauss is about half a parsec at one pev .",
    "the parsec scale is also typical of the size of structures in the interstellar medium driven by supernova explosions . for particles with higher energy and larger gyroradii , diffusion in the interstellar medium may become less efficient .",
    "estimates of the maximum energy of particles accelerated at supernova shocks are around the same energy .",
    "it is therefore natural to guess that the knee of the cosmic - ray spectrum around 3 pev has something to do with the end ( or at least the beginning of the end ) of the galactic cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "peters  @xcite described the consequences for energy dependence of the primary composition if the spectrum is characterized by a maximum rigidity , @xmath3 , which could be associated either with propagation or with acceleration ( or both ) .",
    "the relation between rigidity and total energy is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total energy of a nucleus of charge @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 .",
    "if cosmic rays are classified by energy per particle , as is the case for air shower measurements , then the spectrum should steepen first for protons , then for helium , then for the the cno group etc .",
    "elsewhere  @xcite i have called this sequence the `` peters cycle '' .",
    "several air shower measurements show some evidence that the spectrum becomes progressively enriched in heavy nuclei through the knee region .",
    "the clearest evidence for the peters sequence for several groups of nuclei comes from analysis of the kascade experiment  @xcite .",
    "data from direct measurements above 100 tev are sparse , leaving a gap that is bridged by emulsion chamber data with low statistics below a pev and by the threshold region of air shower experiments above 100 tev .",
    "apart from the technical problems of low statistics and systematic threshold effects , there is also the problem that air shower experiments do not identify individual primary nuclei .",
    "in addition , the efficiency of ground arrays depends strongly on primary mass in the threshold region .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to form a fairly consistent picture of the cosmic - ray spectrum up to the knee .     and by @xmath8 for clarity ( see text ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    figure  [ fig2 ] shows several measurements of the primary spectrum through the knee region . up to 100 gev",
    "there are good measurements of the spectra of protons and helium with magnetic spectrometers flown in spacecraft  @xcite and high - altitude balloons  @xcite . using the ams  @xcite and bess  @xcite measurements , together with measurements of heavier nuclei at @xmath9  gev / nucleon  @xcite ,",
    "i have converted the spectra of protons , helium , cno , ne - si and fe from energy per nucleon to total energy per particle and combined them to give the all particle spectrum at low energy ( shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    the highest energy direct measurements in which individual nuclei are identified directly are from emulsion chamber experiments .",
    "measurements of protons and helium from runjob  @xcite and jacee  @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "preliminary data on protons and helium from the atic thin ionization chamber  @xcite ( not shown here ) are consistent with a smooth power - law extrapolaton between the bess and ams spectromter data at low energy and the runjob data above @xmath9  tev .",
    "( the jacee helium data are higher . )",
    "the solid line normalized to the all - particle spectrum at 100 gev and extrapolated to 1 pev with an @xmath10 power law is consistent with the all - particle measurements of grigorov  @xcite but about a factor 1.5 above the sum of the runjob spectra at 100 tev .",
    "( using the higher jacee measurement of helium would bring the emulsion chamber measurements into agreement with the @xmath10 extrapolation at 100 tev . )",
    "an external motivation for using the hard extrapolation from the spectrometer measurements comes from the super - k measurement of the flux of atmospheric neutrinos , where the best fit to the data requires an even harder extrapolation of the primary spectrum above 100 gev  @xcite .",
    "even with the hard @xmath10 spectrum , the extrapolation of the direct measurements comes in somewhat below the air shower measurements .",
    "moreover , the all - particle spectrum of runjob  @xcite is somewhat below the lowest - energy air shower data , so there may be some systematic offset between the direct measurements and the measurements of air showers .",
    "there is also a slight correlation between hardness of the fitted spectrum and primary mass in this energy range  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , no sign @xcite of the sharp steepening of the proton spectrum , below @xmath1  tev , which would be the case if the maximum rigidity accessible in most galactic cosmic - ray accelerators were around @xmath1  tv or below as originally estimated for diffusive shock acceleration by expanding supernova remnants  @xcite .",
    "although there are systematic differences among the various air shower measurements in the knee region , all show that the spectrum steepens from @xmath11 or slightly harder below @xmath12  pev to @xmath13 above @xmath9  pev .",
    "figure  [ fig2]b shows several results .",
    "two of the measurements  @xcite show evidence of structure in the knee region , while the others  @xcite do not .",
    "the figure also shows the spectra of two of the measurements ( casa - mia and tibet ) with the energy assignments of the latter shifted down by a factor of @xmath14 , which may be taken as an indication of systematic uncertainties in energy assignment .",
    "the shapes of these two spectra agree well with each other .",
    "some authors  @xcite have suggested that a single source contributes significantly to the flux of cosmic - rays in the knee region .",
    "the possible offset between the air - shower measurements and the extrapolation of the direct measurements leaves room for such a possibility .",
    "others  @xcite argue , however , that the overall smoothness of the spectrum indicates a single population , with a secondary acceleration mechanism boosting some of the cosmic rays accelerated by galactic supernova explosions to higher energy .",
    "several authors  @xcite approach the problem from the high - energy end by modelling the highest energy spectrum as arising from a cosmological distribution of sources and subtracting the extra - galactic population from a model of the supernova - accelerated population to see if an extra , high - energy galactic source is required to fill in the energy region above the knee (  population b \"  @xcite ) .",
    "this is an open question at present .",
    "( for a recent review and further references see  @xcite . )    in any case it is interesting to estimate the power required to produce the high - energy end of the galactic cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "to do so , i assume a model of galactic propagation with diffusion characterized by an equivalent leaky box model with a escape time given by @xmath15 which applies for all energies . with this propagation model ( motivated by lack of anisotropy at high enery ) , the source spectrum at low energy must be @xmath16 to give the observed @xmath10 spectrum inside the galaxy . assuming a maximum rigidity of @xmath12  pv for this low - energy component , with a composition as measured by an emulsion chamber experiment  @xcite , the assumed low - energy component can be subtracted from the observed spectrum .",
    "the total power required to account for the observed spectrum up to @xmath12  eev is then @xmath17 erg / sec .",
    "such an estimate is obviousy very model dependent , but not unreasonably large compared to what might be available in individual galactic sources .",
    "what is needed to make progress is a precise knowledge of the energy - dependence of the major groups of nuclei ( p , he , cno , heavy ) through the knee region .",
    "if there are several important groups of sources with different maximum rigidities then there should be a corresponding sequence of peters cycles , perhaps characterized by different compositions .",
    "the transition to extra - galactic cosmic - rays would be characterized by a transition from heavy nuclei ( from the highest galactic source ) to the light component of a cosmological distribution of sources .",
    "a recent summary of composition measurements with air showers in the knee region is given in the rapporteur paper of matthews at the last icrc  @xcite ( see also swordy _ et al . _",
    "overall , the evidence suggests a change in composition toward hearvier primares at higher energy as expected .",
    "however , results of different measurements disagree in detail and the picture is not very clear . as noted in the introduction , the best evidence for the sequence of increasingly heavier groups of nuclei comes from the kascade experiment  @xcite , which uses the ratio of muons to electrons as a probe of primary composition",
    ".    ratio of muons to electrons in the shower front is a classic probe of primary composition . at each interaction of the nucleons in an air shower , roughly 1/3 of the energy not retained by the projectile nucleon is transferred to the electromagnetic component of the cascade via @xmath18 and 2/3 to charged pions .",
    "the charged pions either reinteract or decay depending on their energy and the depth ( and hence the density ) in the atmosphere where they are produced . charged pions that interact contribute further to the electromagnetic component while those that decay feed the muon component of the air shower .",
    "comparing nuclei of the same total energy , charged pions reach the energy at which they can decay earlier in the cascade for heavy primaries than for protons because the initial energy per nucleon is lower by @xmath19 . as a consequence , the ratio of the muonic to the electromagnetic component of an air shower is larger for heavy primaries .    to measure",
    "this ratio with greatest sensitivity requires an observation near shower maximum so that the size of the shower is well correlated with the primary energy . in general , showers in the knee region and somewhat above are observed after shower maximum so that fluctuations in the relation between observed shower size and primary energy are important .",
    "kascade is a surface array near sea level so that these fluctuations are large .",
    "muons detected in kascade typically have energies of a few gev .",
    "an alternative , realized with eastop - macro  @xcite and with spase - amanda  @xcite , is to sample the muon component with a deep underground detector and the electromagnetic component with an array on the surface above .",
    "such a setup selects muons with sufficiently high energy at production to penetrate to the deep detector .",
    "the high - energy muons generally come more from the fragmentation region of phase space of the hadronic interactions in the shower , whereas than the low - energy muons reflect more the less well - understood central region . on the other hand ,",
    "the multiplicity of high - energy muons is small so that fluctuations in muon number are more important .",
    "some of these points are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] which compares @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 for high - energy ( @xmath22  tev ) muons and for low - energy muons in @xmath23 and @xmath24 ev showers simulated with corsika . in general , the mass resolution is somewhat better for the low energy muons provided that the sampling is good enough to get a good measure of the muon number in individual showers , while the energy resolution is better for coincident events with high energy muons , particularly if the surface array is at high altitude .",
    "this complementarity was pointed out by ralph engel  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that analyses of both eastop - macro  @xcite and spase - amanda  @xcite suggest an increase in the mean primary mass in the decade of energy above a pev , that is , through the knee region . as a muon detector",
    ", macro has the advantage of resolving muon tracks , whereas amanda reconstructs the light pool generated by the bundle , which gives a measure of the energy deposition of the muons .",
    "a limitation of both experiments is the relatively small sampling area of the deep muon detectors , which has to be accounted for in the comparison between data and simulations .",
    "icecube , with its surface component icetop , now under construction at the south pole  @xcite will have a much larger acceptance .",
    "engineering data from the first year of operation of icecube with four icetop stations and one string demonstrate the ability of icecube to reconstruct events with few nanosecond accuracy over distances of more than two kilometers  @xcite .",
    "since january 2006 icecube has been operating with 16 surface stations and 9 strings of detectors in the ice .",
    "each string contains 60 digital optical modules ( doms ) evenly spaced in the clear ice between 1450 and 2450 meters below the surface .",
    "each icetop station consists of two ice cherenkov tanks separate from each other by 10 meters and located 25 m from the top of the corresponding icecube string .",
    "each tank is instrumented with two of the same doms used in the ice . with a nominal grid spacing of @xmath25  m ,",
    "the acceptance of the current partial array is @xmath26",
    "m@xmath27sr , which allows detection of coincident events approaching @xmath28  ev . the acceptance of the full icecube as a three - dimensional air shower array will be approximately @xmath29  km@xmath27sr , allowing measurement of coincident events up to an eev .",
    "it is scheduled for completion in 2011 and will be operating in the meantime as new detectors are added .",
    "analysis of measurements of energy - dependence of the depth of shower maximum with hires  @xcite suggest a change in composition from heavy to light as energy increases from @xmath28 to @xmath30  ev .",
    "shower maximum is deeper in the atmosphere for protons than for heavy nuclei of the same total energy .",
    "the measured depth of shower maximum increases more rapidly than expected from model calculations , indicating an increasing fraction of protons as energy increases .",
    "a similar change was observed in analysis of the fly s eye data  @xcite but at a higher energy ( above @xmath30  ev ) .",
    "it was recognized at the time that such a change of composition could be a signature of the transition from a population of galactic cosmic rays to an extra - galactic population . in view of the more recent data , the signature of a transition appears to occur at a lower energy ( below @xmath30  ev ) . a discussion and references to cosmological scenarios in which the transition to extra - galactic cosmic rays occurs at relatively low energy is given by hillas  @xcite .",
    "several new experiments are planned or in operation that can explore the energy region from the knee to the eev region to overlap with the threshold region of the giant arrays auger  @xcite and ( formerly ) agasa  @xcite .",
    "the most advanced of these if kascade - grande  @xcite , a large sea - level array that includes the original kascade as a subarray .",
    "icecube is under construction as described in ",
    "telescope array  @xcite and its low - energy extension , tale  @xcite , are under development in utah .",
    "there is a propsed array of atmospheric cherenkov detectors , tunka  @xcite , in russia , and use of the radio technique for a large acceptance air shower detector is being explored  @xcite .",
    "understanding the transition from a galactic to an extra - galactic population of cosmic rays is an interesting and important goal for the near future .",
