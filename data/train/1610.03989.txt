    "integrable spin chains often provide a fertile ground for studying key theoretical concepts in a simple framework that captures the essential features of the problems under consideration .",
    "an important example of this assertion is the analysis of the entanglement of a quantum system , which can be considered as one of the fundamental characteristics of the quantum realm  @xcite .",
    "one of the most common ways of measuring the degree of entanglement of a state of a quantum system  @xmath2 is via the bipartite entropy of a subsystem  @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this entropy is defined by  @xmath4 , where  @xmath5 is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem  @xmath3 , @xmath6 is the density matrix representing the state of the whole system , and @xmath7 is an appropriate entropy functional ( von neumann , rnyi , etc . ) .",
    "the small class of models for which the entanglement entropy can be evaluated in closed form ( at least in the thermodynamic limit ) includes certain integrable spin chains , like the lipkin  meshkov ",
    "glick model  @xcite , its @xmath8 generalization  @xcite and the nearest - neighbors heisenberg @xmath9 and  @xmath10 models  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the latter two models are critical ( gapless ) for a certain range of values of the applied magnetic field , their corresponding virasoro algebras having central charge respectively equal to @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in both cases , the bipartite rnyi entropy of a block of  @xmath13 consecutive spins when the whole chain is in its ground state scales as @xmath14 in the critical phase , where  @xmath15 is the rnyi parameter ( @xmath16 for the von neumann entropy ) and @xmath17 is the central charge .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the scaling of the rnyi entanglement entropy of a ( @xmath18)-dimensional conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the logarithmic scaling of the ground state entanglement entropy is a characteristic feature of critical ( fermionic ) one - dimensional lattice models with short - range interactions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in a previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we showed that the above results also apply to a large class of supersymmetric spin chains with general ( not necessarily short - range ) interactions , which turn out to be equivalent to a suitable free fermion model .",
    "the critical character of these chains ( for appropriate values of the chemical potential  @xmath19 ) was ascertained via the analysis of the low - temperature behavior of the free energy per spin .",
    "indeed , we proved that when the dispersion relation  @xmath20 of the corresponding free fermion model is monotonic in the interval  @xmath21 $ ] , for  @xmath22 the free energy per spin is approximately given ( in natural units  @xmath23 ) by @xmath24 where  @xmath25 is the fermi velocity ( or effective speed of `` sound '' ) and  @xmath26 .",
    "this is precisely the expected behavior of the free energy for any critical model ( @xmath17 being the central charge of its virasoro algebra ) , since at low temperatures the free energy of a quantum system is determined by its lowest energy levels , and the free energy per spin of a ( @xmath18)-dimensional cft with central charge  @xmath17 satisfies   for sufficiently small  @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "we also studied the ground - state rnyi entanglement entropy of the above mentioned supersymmetric spin chains , showing that in the thermodynamic limit  @xmath28 it again behaves as that of a @xmath1-dimensional cft with central charge  @xmath26 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite by suppressing the requirement that the dispersion relation be monotonic in  @xmath21 $ ] . as shown in section  [ sec.disp ] ,",
    "this makes it possible to treat a host of naturally arising models , like supersymmetric spin chains with near and next - to - near interactions , or with long - range rational interactions , whose dispersion relation is not always monotonic .",
    "in fact , the entanglement entropy of fairly arbitrary energy eigenstates of one - dimensional free fermionic systems ( in particular , of the ground state of such systems with a non - monotonic dispersion relation ) has been previously studied in the literature ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . in general , the entanglement entropy of the ground state of these models grows logarithmically with the size  @xmath13 of the subsystem , with a constant prefactor determined by the number of boundary points of the fermi `` surface '' in @xmath29 .",
    "this logarithmic scaling is a manifestation of the so - called `` area law '' , which is believed to hold for critical fermionic systems in an arbitrary number of dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the  @xmath0 supersymmetric chains studied in this paper do indeed satisfy the area law .",
    "more precisely , by analyzing the low - temperature behavior of the free energy we shall first show that the models under consideration are critical for  @xmath30 , where  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 respectively denote the minimum and maximum values of the dispersion relation .",
    "( as explained in section  [ sec.crit ] , strictly speaking this is only true if the roots of the equation  @xmath33 are all simple . ) from the latter analysis it also follows that the central charge of these models is equal to the number  @xmath34 of disjoint intervals that make up the fermi sea .",
    "we shall next study the ground state rnyi entanglement entropy , showing that in the thermodynamic limit  @xmath28 it behaves as @xmath35 .",
    "we shall explicitly compute the ( non - universal ) constant  @xmath36 , and prove that the prefactor  @xmath37 is equal to  @xmath38 .",
    "this is in agreement with the value of the central charge deduced from the low - temperature analysis of the free energy , and once again confirms the conjecture that the entanglement properties of critical fermion models are entirely determined by the topology of their fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "we shall end this section with a few words on the paper s organization .",
    "in section  [ sec.model ] we recall the definition of the supersymmetric chains under consideration and review their main properties .",
    "section  [ sec.disp ] is devoted to the analysis of the models dispersion relation and the construction of simple examples of supersymmetric chains , featuring both short- and long - range interactions , with a non - monotonic dispersion relation . in section  [ sec.crit ]",
    "we derive the asymptotic behavior of the models free energy per spin at low temperature , showing that they are critical in an appropriate range of the chemical potential , and determine the central charge of the corresponding virasoro algebra .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the entanglement entropy of the models ground state is determined in section  [ sec.gsee ] using a particular case of the fisher  hartwig conjecture for toeplitz matrices  @xcite rigorously proved by  bttcher and silbermann  @xcite .",
    "we briefly state our conclusions and outline several future developments suggested by the present work in section  [ sec.conc ] .",
    "the paper ends with three appendices in which we present a review of the application of the fisher  hartwig conjecture in the present context , as well as the proofs of several technical results used throughout section  [ sec.gsee ] .",
    "the type of models we shall study in this work is the class of  @xmath0 supersymmetric spin chains with translationally invariant interactions introduced in ref .  @xcite . in the latter models",
    "each site is occupied either by a scalar boson or a spinless fermion , whose creation operators we shall respectively denote by  @xmath39 and  @xmath40 , the subindex  @xmath41 indicating the site on which these operators act .",
    "thus the hilbert space is the @xmath42-dimensional subspace  @xmath43 of the infinite - dimensional fock space defined by the constraints @xmath44 the hamiltonian of the models under consideration is given by   to  @xmath45 unless otherwise stated . ]",
    "@xmath46 where the operator @xmath47 is the total fermion number @xmath48 so that the real parameter  @xmath19 has the natural interpretation of the fermions chemical potential .",
    "the real - valued function  @xmath49 giving the strength of the interaction between two particles  @xmath50 sites apart is assumed to satisfy the constraint @xmath51 but is otherwise arbitrary   was implicitly assumed to be nonnegative for all  @xmath52 in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we shall drop the latter requirement , which is not essential in what follows . ] . in other words ,",
    "the chain is _ closed _ , i.e , translationally invariant .",
    "finally , @xmath53 is the @xmath0 spin permutation operator , defined by  @xcite @xmath54 equivalently , let  @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 ) be a state of the canonical spin basis , where  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 respectively denote the state with one boson or one fermion .",
    "the action of  @xmath53 on the latter state is then given by @xmath59 where  @xmath60 if @xmath61 while for @xmath62 @xmath63 equals the number of fermions in the state  @xmath64 occupying the sites  @xmath65 .",
    "the operator  @xmath53 is clearly invariant under the supersymmetry transformation  @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , and on  @xmath43 we have  @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the total boson number .",
    "hence the hamiltonian   is indeed supersymmetric - invariant , up to a constant term and the usual relabeling @xmath70 .",
    "the fundamental feature of the @xmath0 supersymmetric chain  , explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , is that it can be mapped into a free - fermion model by interpreting the boson state  @xmath57 as the fermion vacuum .",
    "more precisely , consider the operators @xmath71 which can be regarded as a new set of fermion creation operators as they obviously satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations ( car ) on @xmath43 .",
    "it was shown by haldane  @xcite that on  @xmath43 the @xmath0 permutation operator @xmath53 can be simply expressed as @xmath72 substituting into eq .",
    "we readily obtain @xmath73 where @xmath74 we thus see that the spin chain   is indeed equivalent to a free - fermion model with hopping amplitude  @xmath75 and chemical potential  @xmath76 .    since the hamiltonian   is translationally invariant on account of eq .",
    ", it can be diagonalized by the discrete fourier transform @xmath77 indeed , the operators @xmath78 obviously satisfy the car , and can therefore be considered as a new set of fermionic operators .",
    "moreover , a straightforward calculation shows that  @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80h_n(j)\\,.\\ ] ] likewise , the system s total momentum operator  @xmath81 is given by  @xcite @xmath82 with @xmath83 thus the operator  @xmath84 creates a ( non - localized ) fermion with well - defined energy  @xmath85 and momentum @xmath86 .",
    "it follows from eq .   that the spectrum of  @xmath87 is the set of numbers of the form @xmath88 with  @xmath89 , whose corresponding eigenstates are given by @xmath90",
    "an essential requirement making it possible to study the chain   or , equivalently , its fermionic counterpart   in the thermodynamic limit is the existence of a smooth function  @xmath20 _ independent of @xmath45 _ such that when @xmath91 we have @xmath92 when this is the case , we shall refer to  @xmath20 as the model s _",
