    "the geometry and kinematics of the broad - line region ( blr ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have been studied for about three decades but the details are far from well understood .",
    "it is widely accepted that the blr is stratified : high - ionization lines originate from small radii and low - ionization lines arise further out @xcite .",
    "this stratification picture is supported by the results of reverberation mapping , which show that lines of different ionization have different lags ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of the systemic velocities of the emission lines on ionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the blr may originate from a wind and a disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , the profiles of the broad emission lines often contain multiple velocity components , suggesting that the structure of the blr may be more complex than can be described by a simple stratification or wind @xmath2 disk model .",
    "it has been known that the broad @xmath0  line profiles are generally not well described by a single gaussian .",
    "two gaussians ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or a gauss - hermite function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are often used .",
    "additionally , the profiles show great diversity from object to object .",
    "sources with narrower @xmath0  lines tend to have stronger line wings , while those with broader @xmath0  lines are dominated by the line core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some sources have asymmetric and shifted @xmath0   profiles , suggesting that the blr has a structure more complex than a single virialized component .",
    "the @xmath0  profile of oq 208 , for example , has an additional redshifted @xmath0  component of intermediate width that closely resembles the kinematics of fe ii  @xcite .",
    "additional evidence that the blr contains two or more kinematically distinct components comes from differential variability between the line core and wing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of an intermediate - line region and a very broad - line region for @xmath0  emission was suggested by some previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in a recent spectral decomposition of a large sample of quasars selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , hu et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereinafter paper i ) find that the majority of quasars show fe ii  emission that is both redshifted and narrower than @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the fe ii  redshift correlates inversely with the eddington ratio .",
    "these characteristics suggest that fe ii  originates from an exterior portion of the blr , whose dynamics may be dominated by infall .",
    "these findings offer fresh insights into the structure of the blr .    in light of the trends associated with fe ii  emission",
    ", we expect that a portion of the @xmath0-emitting gas may be related to an inflowing component too . in this letter",
    ", we systematically study the @xmath0  profiles of sdss quasars to try to answer two questions : do all quasars have an intermediate - width @xmath0   component similar to oq 208 , and , if so , is this component also associate with the fe ii  emission ?",
    "we show that the conventional broad @xmath0  line actually consists of two kinematically linked components , one of which originates from the same region that emits fe ii .",
    "our sample is selected from the sdss fifth data release ( @xcite ) quasar catalog @xcite .",
    "we choose objects with redshifts @xmath3 to ensure that  @xmath45007 lies within the sdss spectral coverage .",
    "we also require a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath5 10 in the restframe wavelength range 44305550   ( covering @xmath0 , , and the most prominent features of optical fe ii  emission ) and that no more than 1/3 of the pixels are masked by the sdss pipeline in this region .",
    "7601 quasars satisfy these criteria .",
    "the spectral analysis , whose details are described in paper i , involves fitting a continuum model in a set of windows devoid of strong emission lines that consists of ( 1 ) a single power law , ( 2 ) balmer continuum supplemented with high - order balmer emission lines , and ( 3 ) a pseudo - continuum due to blended fe ii  emission .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and shift of fe ii  are measured from the continuum decomposition . after subtracting the continuum model ,",
    "the @xmath0  line is decomposed into narrow ( @xmath6 ) and broad ( @xmath7 ) components .",
    "@xmath6  is forced to have the same profile as , a shift of up to 600 @xmath8  relative to , and an intensity constrained to lie between 1/20 and 1/3 of that of .",
    "@xmath7  is modeled using a gauss - hermite function @xcite , whose best fit yields fwhm(@xmath7 ) .",
    "the rest frame is defined by the peak of the  @xmath45007 ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "although the gauss - hermite function provides a good and convenient mathematical description of the @xmath7  profile , for the purpose of this letter  investigating whether there is an intermediate - width @xmath0  component associated with fe ii  emission  we use the following simpler method to fit @xmath7 .",
    "first , we use only one gaussian to model the broad @xmath0  line ( hereinafter the single - gaussian model ) .",
    "then we fit broad @xmath0  with two gaussians ( hereinafter the double - gaussian model ) , an intermediate - width component ( @xmath9 ) and a very broad component ( @xmath10 ) . in both models , @xmath6",
    "is fitted in the same way as in paper i. first , we compare the @xmath11  of the double - gaussian model and the gauss - hermite .",
    "there are 630 sources with @xmath11  20% larger in the double - gaussian model than in the gauss - hermite model @xcite ; this means that the double - gaussian fit is still inadequate for these sources  20% smaller for the double - gaussian model than for the gauss - hermite model , and for most sources both models are equally good . ] .",
    "then , for the sources that can be well fitted by the double - gaussian model , we compare the reduced @xmath11  of the double - gaussian and single - gaussian model , and use the f - test ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 12.1 ) to calculate how significantly the double - gaussian model improves the fit . whether a source needs two gaussians or not depends on its @xmath7  width .",
    "figure [ fig - hbwfp]_a _ shows the probability @xmath12 that the double - gaussian model can not improve the fit , as a function of fwhm(@xmath7 ) .",
    "the 2435 sources below the dashed line ( @xmath13 of the whole sample ) require two gaussians at a significance greater than 3 @xmath14 . for sources with fwhm(@xmath7 )",
    "@xmath15 5000 @xmath8 , one gaussian is enough to describe the profile of @xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , who find that the ratio fwhm/@xmath14 ( @xmath14 is the line dispersion ) of @xmath7depends on its line width ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) . for sources with broader",
    "@xmath7 , this ratio is close to 2.35 , the value for a single gaussian .",
    "as discussed later , this means that broader sources have a weaker @xmath9  component .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to determine the detection threshold of @xmath9 .",
    "we generate artificial @xmath0  lines using two components [ fwhm(@xmath10 ) is set to 2.5 fwhm(@xmath9 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - hbihbvb ] ] , fit it using a single and a double gaussian , and then calculate the probability @xmath12 as before . the ew ratio of @xmath9/@xmath10  is increased progressively until @xmath16 exceeds 99.73% .",
    "( all ew measurements refer to the continuum at 5100  . )",
    "the critical ew ratio of @xmath9/@xmath10  depends on s / n , as shown in figure [ fig - hbwfp]_b_. in order to detect an @xmath9  component with an ew that is 10% larger than the ew of @xmath10 , the s / n should be larger than @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in the analysis below , we remove all sources with ( 1 ) s / n @xmath18 , ( 2 ) @xmath11  of double - gaussian 20% larger than the @xmath11  of gauss - hermite and @xmath19% , and ( 3 ) ew(fe ) @xmath20 25   ( to insure that the fe ii  measurements are as reliable as those in paper i ) .",
    "these three cuts left 1499 , 811 , and 568 sources , respectively .",
    "note that the fraction of sources that require a double - gussian model ( 811/1499 @xmath21 54% ) is larger than the fraction when the s / n threshold is 10 ( 2435/7601 @xmath21 32% ) , consistent with the simulations above : fainter @xmath9  can be detected with higher s / n .",
    "the analysis below focuses on the most stringent subset of 568 sources ( @xmath22 of the sources with s / n @xmath5 22.5 ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath11  for the double - gaussian model fit has a median value of 1.004 .    to constrain the relative strengths of fe ii  emission",
    "associated with the very broad and intermediate - width components , we generated simulated spectra using two fe ii  components , and then fit them using only one component , whose width is fixed to that of the input intermediate - width component .",
    "the ew of the input very broad component is increased progressively until the reduced @xmath11   of the fit exceeds 1 @xmath14 from the expect value . for a typical fe ii  ew of 75   and s / n @xmath21 25 in our final sample ,",
    "the flux ratio of fe ii   between the input very broad component and intermediate - width component is @xmath230.3 .",
    "this is the upper limit of the fe ii  emission coming from the very broad component .",
    "figure [ fig - example ] shows the emission - line fitting and fe ii  emission measurement for three typical sources .",
    "a _ is an extreme case that has a large fe iiredshift ( 1533@xmath2424 @xmath8 ) and @xmath0  with an isolated red peak .",
    "the fe ii  in example _ b _ is moderately redshifted ( 590@xmath2498 @xmath8 ) , and its @xmath0  core shows only a strong red asymmetry rather than another peak . a more common situation is seen in example _ c _ , in which fe ii  and @xmath9  have no shift and the @xmath0  profile is symmetrical .",
    "table [ tab - all ] lists the measurements of the three sources shown in figure [ fig - example ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we find that @xmath9  and fe ii  emission have similar kinematics .",
    "the similarity can be seen not only in individual sources , but also statistically for the whole sample . from examples",
    "_ a _ to _ c _ in figure [ fig - example ] , the @xmath0  profiles change progressively while the fe ii  shifts become lower and lower .",
    "figure [ fig - hbife]_a _ shows a strong correlation between @xmath9and fe ii  shifts .",
    "pearson s correlation coefficient @xmath25 is 0.22 , and the probability @xmath12 of a chance correlation is @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath9  and fe ii  have approximately the same shifts .",
    "the widths of @xmath9  and fe ii  are also well correlated and roughly equal ( fig .",
    "[ fig - hbife]_b _ ) ; @xmath25 = 0.48 and @xmath27 . except for some sources to the upper left of the solid lines whose errors are large ,",
    "the majority of sources follow the relation that @xmath9  and fe ii  have the same shifts and widths . by contrast , fe ii  and @xmath10  have different shifts and widths ( fig .",
    "[ fig - hbvbfe ] ) .",
    "we also find that the kinematic connection between @xmath9  and @xmath10  is complicated .",
    "no correlation between @xmath9  and @xmath10  shifts is seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig - hbihbvb]_a _ ) , but the @xmath9  and @xmath10  widths are strongly linked , such that fwhm(@xmath10 ) @xmath21 2.5 fwhm(@xmath9 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig - hbihbvb]_b _ ) .",
    "the observational results described above suggest a scenario in which the conventional blr consists of two components  an intermediate - line region ( ilr ) and a very broad - line region ( vblr ) . if both regions are virialized , so that @xmath28 , then the ilr is about @xmath29 or 6.25 times farther from the center than the vblr . because of its redshift , the kinematics of the ilr may be dominated by infall .",
    "emission emerges from both the ilr and vblr , while most of the fe ii  emission comes from the ilr .",
    "the ilr and vblr defined in this paper are essentially similar to those described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite but differ from those in @xcite or @xcite , which refer to the c iv - emitting region .",
    "note that the ilr and vblr of the @xmath0-emitting region are distinct from those of the c iv - emitting region because the c iv  ilr usually has the systemic redshift while the c iv  vblr shows a blueshift .    the lack of correlation between the ews of @xmath9  and @xmath10  ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ew]_a _ ) strongly suggests that the two components are emitted from different regions .",
    "if both are photoionized , they must have different covering factors .",
    "the relative strength between @xmath9  and @xmath10  determines the final @xmath0  profiles . in figure",
    "[ fig - hbwfp ] , sources broader than @xmath235000 @xmath8  can be fitted well using one gaussian .",
    "this trend can be interpreted in our two - component blr scenario .",
    "it is well known that sources with broad @xmath0  tend to have weak fe ii/@xmath0   ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ilr is weak in these systems because fe ii  is weak .",
    "their profiles show little deviation from a single gaussian under the typical s / n level of sdss spectra .",
    "the composite spectra of sources with large fe ii  redshifts , on the other hand , do show red asymmetry in the @xmath0  profiles ( see fig .",
    "13 of paper i ) .",
    "the variation in the relative strength of the @xmath10  and @xmath9  components in different sources reflects the competition between the two components , although they apparently do so in such a manner that their kinematics remained coupled .",
    "it is of interest to note that the strengths of @xmath9  and fe iiare not correlated ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ew]_b _ ) .",
    "the wide range of fe ii/@xmath9  ratios reflects either the complexity of the excitation mechanism of fe ii  emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or large variations in quasar metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have studied the profiles of the @xmath0  emission line using a large sample of quasars selected from sdss . comparing the @xmath0  profiles with the properties of fe ii  emission given in paper i",
    ", we deduced the existence of two @xmath0   emission regions  an intermediate - line region and a very broad - line region .",
    "the observational evidence can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the velocity shifts and widths of the @xmath0  intermediate - width component are approximately the same as those of fe ii , indicating that they originate from the same region .",
    "however , the fe ii/@xmath9  ratios vary greatly from object to object , reflecting variations in either metal abundance or excitation conditions in the fe ii - emitting region .",
    "the velocity width of the very broad component of @xmath0  is roughly 2.5 times larger than that of the intermediate - width component , but no correlation exists between their radial velocities .",
    "the equivalent widths of the two components are also unrelated , suggesting that they have very different covering factors and geometry .",
    "the conventional blr seems to consist of two different , physically distinct regions .",
    "we suggest that the intermediate - width component of @xmath0  and fe ii  trace an infalling region in the outskirts of the blr , likely located in between the molecular torus and the accretion disk .",
    "the properties of the @xmath0-emitting region discussed here , in conjunction with those of fe ii  emission summarized in paper i , offer important new constraints on models of the broad emission - line regions",
