    "when the displacement of the pendulum is not restricted to small values , we are considering a ( general ) pendulum ( or oscillator ) . a pendulum oscillating ( or rotating ) about a rigidly fixed ( point )",
    "fulcrum is exactly equivalent to a particle moving in a medium of friction coefficient @xmath0 along a potential @xmath1 and driven by the external periodic forcing @xmath2 .",
    "the equation of motion of the pendulum ( identifying @xmath3 with the angular displacement @xmath4 , etc ) is given by : @xmath5    here the system is considered to be in equilibrium with an environment at temperature @xmath6 and the motion is underdamped @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the natural frequency of oscillation .",
    "the driven pendulum , when the damping is small , has so far not found exact analytical description @xcite .",
    "therefore , we resort to other , for example numerical and experimental , means of description .",
    "the problem of pendulum has exact analogies in , and can be considered as the prototype of , many other phenomena of interest @xcite .",
    "apart from a particle moving on the surface of a sinusoidal potential , some of the examples being ionic motion in a superionic conductor , and a phase motion in a josephson junction . the structure of the equations of motion for these phenomena is identical only the physical significance of the parameters differ .",
    "the dimensionless form of the equation of motion is : @xmath9    here , all parameters are dimensionless and written by taking @xmath10 as independent parameters and setting @xmath11 .",
    "note that , in these dimensionless units , the natural ( angular ) frequency @xmath12 turns out to be 1 .    for this dimensionless equation of motion , even in the case of underdamped motion ,",
    "the allowed space of parameters @xmath13 is vast .",
    "however , for our purpose , we restrict our investigation to a limited range of @xmath14 space with @xmath15 .",
    "note that if we view @xmath16 as a force derived from an effective potential @xmath17 , the potential , @xmath18 , gets tilted by an effective slope of @xmath19 . in the extreme cases , @xmath20 , so that the potential barrier disappears , momentarily or for a longer period , only for @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath15 , thus corresponds to the potential barrier remaining finite throughout the period of @xmath22 .",
    "that is , in the pendulum parlance , unless provoked by an appropriate additional forcing , for example , by thermal fluctuations , the pendulum can not go over the top and make a full circle .",
    "of course , this important possibility of going over the potential barrier will also be considered as we proceed by including thermal fluctuations .",
    "interesting numerical results , supported by experiment ( see figs . 1 and 2 and table 1 ) , are obtained in the range , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , of parameter space @xmath14 or @xmath25 , with @xmath26 . since the potential @xmath27 is periodic , the choice of initial positions @xmath28 , suffices to obtain all possible trajectories , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . of course , we just release the pendulum initially from a static condition @xmath31 ( at @xmath32)@xmath33 .",
    "however , one could take the initial velocity @xmath34 non - zero too without altering the essential qualitative results of our interest .",

    "the output voltage @xmath49 represents the trajectory @xmath29 ( or the angular displacement @xmath50 ) of equation ( 1.2 ) .",
    "we perform the experiment in the earlier stated region of parameter space @xmath25 i.e. , in the space of @xmath51 , and for @xmath52 or the amplitude @xmath53 near about 0.2 of the drive current @xmath54 .",
    "figure 3 shows the result of our experiment .",
    "it shows that for the same periodic drive , we obtain two ( and only two ) possible kinds of trajectories depending on the initial conditions taken .",
    "one of them oscillating with a large amplitude and having a large phase lag ( figure 3 ( b ) ) with respect to the externally applied field @xmath54 and the other oscillating with a small amplitude and having a small phase lag ( figure 3 ( d ) ) . in other words , for a given applied field @xmath54 at @xmath55 one gets a fraction of large amplitude output signals and the remaining being of small amplitude . our experimental result , thus , verifies the existence of the two solutions or states of trajectories of a pendulum which was numerically discovered earlier .",
    "of the output voltage signal as a function of the period @xmath56 of the drive for @xmath57.,width=566,height=302 ]     ( a ) of the output voltage signal as a function of the period @xmath56 of the drive for @xmath57.,width=566,height=302 ]    in fig . 4 and fig . 5",
    ", we see the nature of the amplitude and phase lag of the output voltage signal as a function of @xmath56 for various values of @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "4 , we plot the average amplitude @xmath58 , and in fig . 5",
    ", we plot the phase lags @xmath59 between the states of output voltage signal @xmath60 and the drive field @xmath54 as @xmath61 is varied .",
    "we notice that both a@xmath62 and @xmath59 change continuously as @xmath56 is varied for both states for @xmath57 .",
    "we obtain two branches of the output voltage signal for @xmath63 .",
    "plots at the top refers to the large amplitude state ( la ) having a large amplitude ( fig .",
    "4 ) and a large phase lag ( fig .",
    "5 ) , and the plots at the bottom refers to the small amplitude states ( sa ) having a small amplitude ( fig .",
    "4 ) and a small phase lag ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "there is a region of @xmath56 where both the two states coexist .",
    "these region of @xmath56 where both the states overlap is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the plot in the inset shows that for small @xmath0 values , the range of @xmath56 values where both the two states coexist is large .",
    "however , as @xmath0 value is increased , we see that the range of @xmath56 values decreases till it reaches a point where the two dynamical states terminate ( merge into one ) . the value of @xmath0 where the two dynamical states terminate is found to be @xmath64 . in this region where the two states terminate , we can see only one kind of output voltage signal where @xmath59 and a@xmath62 change continuously as @xmath56 is varied in the entire range .",
    "therefore , one can not identify from the graph to call the output voltage signal sa or la for @xmath65 . when compared the range of @xmath56 values ( inset of fig .",
    "4 ) where both the states overlapped with the numerical result ( fig .",
    "6 ) , we can see that experimentally , the range of @xmath56 values is very small .",
    "this is due to the fact that we have explore only few values of the initial condition .",
    "an exhaustive initial conditions , however , may change the range of @xmath56 values by a small amount .     showing the coexistence of the two dynamical states for different @xmath0 values ( see fig .",
    "3 [ 8]).,width=566,height=302 ]    numerically , it has been found that these two `` trajectories '' are distinct and robust and can be given the status of dynamical states having their own basins of attraction in the @xmath66 phase plane @xcite .",
    "it will be appropriate to remark that the result is not only interesting it is novel as well .",
    "the importance of the discovery of these dynamical states is enhanced by the fact that as the temperature is raised from zero ( as a noise signal is added to the input signal ) the two states make transitions between them . in other words , as additional provocations due to thermal fluctuations are included , the fraction of the large amplitude states ( and hence that of the small amplitude state ) changes .",
    "we could observe this in our experiment by adding a feeble gaussian noise to the input signal .",
    "numerically @xcite , it was found that @xcite , for @xmath15 , as the temperature is raised gradually from zero , initially large amplitude states ( from among a collection or ensemble of them ) begin to jump over to the small amplitude state and not the other way round .",
    "thus , as the temperature is raised , the fraction of large - amplitude states gradually decrease and attain a minimum . but from then on , as the temperature is increased further , the small amplitude states too begin to jump over to the other state and the fraction of large amplitude states begins to rise from the minimum .",
    "this process continues till a temperature at which the fraction becomes close to 0.5 .",
    "however , as the temperature increases the distinction between the two states gets blurred and the transitions are so frequent that it is hard to observe a state over a significant fraction of a period of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , in a sense , we have a bistable system separated by a barrier ; for @xmath15 , the large amplitude states faces a smaller barrier than the small amplitude state@xcite .",
    "note that oblivious to the underlying sinusoidal ( periodic , multistable ) potential the motion of the pendulum is being described in the language of a bistable system consisting of the two dynamical states of trajectories . though quite imperfectly , one is tempted to draw analogy with the phonons ( normal modes of lattice vibrations or quasiparticles ) in a crystal at small nonzero temperatures .",
    "just as one calculates the specific heat , for example , of crystals at low temperatures in terms of density of phonons , one can describe a phenomenon called stochastic resonance @xcite in a sinusoidal potential in terms of , for example , the fraction of large amplitude states .",
    "it is to be reminded that the change in the fraction is brought about by the transition between the two dynamical states .",
    "the explanation of the possibility of occurrence of stochastic resonance in a sinusoidal potential is thus clothed in terms of a `` bistable potential '' @xcite !",
    "the occurrence of stochastic resonance is indicated by the peaking of the mean hysteresis loop area @xmath67 as a function of noise strength where @xmath29 is the trajectory of particles due to the application of the periodic drive @xmath22 .",
    "this result was obtained numerically @xcite .    in order to observe the occurrence of stochastic resonance in sinusoidal potentials we need in our experiment an additive gaussian white noise signal to be added to the input voltage signal of fig .",
    "1 . we are in the process of implementing this to obtain stochastic resonance in our experiment from the current - voltage characteristic of the circuit as a function of noise strength .",
    "note that so far the occurrence of stochastic resonance has been observed experimentally only in bistable systems @xcite .",
    "our present effort will provide an experimental support to the numerical result obtained earlier on the occurrence of stochastic resonance in periodic potentials .",
    "in this experiment , the operational amplifier that we have use is the ua741 .",
    "if , instead of the ua741 , we use a better performance operational amplifier , we expect to see a relative change in the range of @xmath56 values for different @xmath0 values but the qualiative results will remain the same .",
    "for example , if we use the operational amplifier ad797 , there is a relative increase in the range of @xmath56 values for different @xmath0 values .    from fig .",
    "( 3 ) , we see that two dynamical states exist experimentally .",
    "stochastic resonance has been found earlier to occur due to the transition between these two dynamical states when temperature @xmath68 .",
    "it will be interesting to see the response of the output voltage signal when @xmath68 whether the transition between the two dynamical states do really lead to stochastic resonance . in stochastic resonance ,",
    "one calculates the hysteresis loop area per period of the drive field @xmath54 .",
    "the relative abundance of these two dynamical states for different value of temperature decides the value of the average hysteresis loop area . in this experiment ,",
    "the temperature is taken to be @xmath55 since we havent add a gaussian white noise to the input voltage signal .",
    "the frequency ( or bandwitdh ) of the gaussian white noise has to be very much greater than the frequency of the input voltage signal .",
    "in fact , numerically it is @xmath698000 times higher than the frequency of the input voltage signal .",
