    "conventional quantum thermalization  @xcite is understood as an irreversibly dynamic process under which a quantum system immersed in a heat bath approaches a thermal equilibrium state with the same temperature as that of the bath .",

    "recently , much attention has been paid to quantum thermalization ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . specifically , a new kind of thermalization , called canonical thermalization ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , has been proposed .    the conventional quantum thermalization works for the situations wherein one quantum system is connected with just one environment at thermal equilibrium . when we consider a composite quantum system , which is constructed with many subsystems and connected with many environments , the conventional quantum thermalization is no longer valid .",
    "therefore , the density operator of the composite quantum system at thermal equilibrium can not be written as @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , quantum thermalization of a composite quantum system is a very complex problem .",
    "on one hand , from the viewpoint of the environments , the composite quantum system could be connected with many independent environments or a common environment . at the same time",
    ", the temperatures of these environments could be the same or different .",
    "on the other hand , the coupling strengths among these subsystems can affect the physical picture to describe the quantum thermalization of the composite quantum system .",
    "when the coupling strengths among these subsystems are stronger than the system - bath couplings , the composite quantum system can be regarded as a single system , while it is regarded as many individual subsystems when the couplings among them are weaker than the system - bath couplings .",
    "the above mentioned situations come true in recent years since quantum systems can be manufactured to be more and more complicated and small , based on the great advances in physics , chemistry , and biology  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the research on _ thermodynamics of small systems _ becomes very interesting .",
    "in particular , quantum thermalization of composite quantum systems becomes an important topic since many important results in this field , such as nonequilibrium work relations and fluctuation theorem ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , are based on the thermal equilibrium state of the composite quantum systems . as composite quantum systems",
    "are composed of many subsystems , they could be connected either with many independent environments at different temperatures or a common environment .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask the following questions : ( i ) how do the couplings among the subsystems affect the quantum thermalization of a composite quantum system ?",
    "( ii ) what are the steady - state properties of a composite quantum system when it is connected with either many independent environments or a common environment ?    with these questions , in this paper , we study the quantum thermalization of two coupled two - level systems ( tlss ) that are immersed in either two independent heat baths ( ihbs ) or a common heat bath ( chb ) .",
    "simple as this model is , it is illustrative . when the coupling between the two tlss is stronger than the tls - bath couplings , the two tlss can be considered as an effective composite system , i.e. , a four - level system , and then we understand the quantum thermalization in eigenstate representation of the composite system .",
    "in addition , when the coupling between the two tlss is weaker than the tls - bath couplings , we understand the quantum thermalization from the viewpoint of each individual tls . however , due to the tls - tls coupling , the effective temperatures of the two tlss should be different from those for the decoupling case .    as for the environments , there are two kinds of different situations : the ihb case and the chb case . in the ihb case ,",
    "we find that , when the two ihbs have the same temperatures , the two coupled tlss in the eigenstate representation can be thermalized with the same temperature as those of the ihbs . however , in the case where the two ihbs have different temperatures , just when the energy detuning between the two tlss satisfies a special condition , the two coupled tlss in eigenstate representation can be thermalized with an immediate temperature between those of the two ihbs . in the bare - state representation",
    ", we find a counterintuitive phenomenon that , under some conditions , the temperature of the tls connected with the high - temperature heat bath is lower than that of the other tls , which is connected with the low - temperature heat bath .    in the chb case",
    ", we also study the quantum thermalization in eigenstate and bare - state representations . in the eigenstate representation",
    ", the present case reduces to the conventional quantum thermalization , [ i.e. , one quantum system ( an effective four - level system formed by the two coupled tlss ) is thermalized by one environment ( the common heat bath ) in thermal equilibrium ] .",
    "in addition , we also investigate the effective temperatures of the two tlss in bare - state representation .",
    "it is found that the tls with a larger energy separation can be thermalized with a lower temperature . in particular , in the resonant case , we find a quantum phenomenon of anti - thermalization when the two tlss are connected with a common heat bath .",
