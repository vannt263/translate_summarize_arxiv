    "in this paper we shall consider a general class of finite - dimensional quantum models which by construction are invariant under the yangian algebra @xmath1 .",
    "the key to the yangian invariance of these models is their connection to certain finite - dimensional representations of @xmath1 labeled by a type of skew young diagrams , the so called border strips  @xcite .",
    "these representations play a fundamental role in the study of the integrable two - dimensional conformal field theory related to the latter models , namely the @xmath0 wznw model at level 1  @xcite .",
    "the models we shall be interested in , which we shall refer to as yangian - invariant @xmath0 spin models , are characterized by the fact that their hilbert space is a direct sum of the irreducible representations of @xmath1 labeled by border strips with exactly @xmath3 boxes , where @xmath3 is the number of spins .",
    "the simplest examples of these models are certain integrable spin chains with long range interactions invariant under the yangian for a finite number of spins , namely the @xmath0 supersymmetric versions of the haldane  shastry  @xcite and polychronakos  frahm  @xcite chains ; see , e.g. , @xcite .    as is well known , the haldane  shastry ( hs ) spin chain is a circular ( translationally invariant ) chain with equally spaced sites , the interactions between any two spins being inversely proportional to the square of their chord distance .",
    "this model appears in connection with a wide variety of topics in theoretical and mathematical physics , including one - dimensional anyons  @xcite , conformal field theory  @xcite , quantum chaos  @xcite , quantum information theory  @xcite , and quantum integrability  @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature of the hs chain is the fact that it can be obtained from a dynamical model , namely the spin sutherland ( trigonometric ) model  @xcite , in the strong coupling limit  @xcite . by applying the same procedure to the spin calogero ( rational )  @xcite and inozemtsev ( hyperbolic )  @xcite models ,",
    "one obtains the polychronakos ",
    "frahm ( pf ) and frahm  inozemtsev ( fi )  @xcite spin chains , which share many properties with the original hs chain .",
    "in fact , although the yangian symmetry of the fi chain has not been rigorously established , we shall see in section  [ sec.yinv ] that it is isospectral to a yangian - invariant spin model .",
    "it is clear by its very definition that the class of yangian - invariant spin models encompasses a wide range of quantum systems .",
    "for instance , apart from the integrable spin chains mentioned above , it includes the family of one - dimensional vertex models studied in refs .",
    "a common feature shared by all yangian - invariant spin models is the high degeneracy of their spectrum , stemming from the yangian symmetry .",
    "this statement , however , is far from precise , and does not shed any light on whether a certain model in this class has additional degeneracy due to its particular form .",
    "the main aim of this paper is precisely to perform a quantitative analysis of the degeneracy inherent to all yangian - invariant spin models . to this end , we shall use as a concrete measure of the degree of degeneracy of a finite - dimensional quantum system its average degeneracy , defined as the quotient of the dimension of its hilbert space by the number of distinct energy levels .",
    "we shall derive closed - form expressions for the average degeneracy of a `` generic '' yangian - invariant @xmath0 spin model , both in the supersymmetric ( @xmath4 ) and non - supersymmetric cases .",
    "in fact , these expressions provide a lower bound for the average degeneracy of _ any _ yangian - invariant spin model , and thus can be used as a practical test for ruling out that a particular quantum system belongs to this class .",
    "as it turns out , the behavior of this lower bound ( which we have termed `` minimum average degeneracy '' ) is rather different in the supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric cases . in the former case ,",
    "the minimum average degeneracy is given by a simple power law in terms of the dimension @xmath5 of the one - particle hilbert space ( cf .",
    "far more interestingly , in the non - supersymmetric case the minimum average degeneracy is expressed in terms of generalized fibonacci numbers  @xcite , which reduce to the standard ones for spin @xmath6 ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 equal to @xmath9 ) . using standard properties of the generalized fibonacci numbers ,",
    "we derive the asymptotic behavior as the number of spins tends to infinity of the minimum average degeneracy in the non - supersymmetric case .",
    "we find that the leading behavior is again a power law involving the largest root ( in module ) of the characteristic polynomial of the generalized fibonacci numbers .",
    "another goal of this work is to ascertain to what degree the average degeneracy of the three spin chains of haldane  shastry type ( i.e. , the hs , pf and fi chains ) behaves as expected for a generic yangian - invariant spin model .",
    "contrary to popular belief , we find out that this is actually not the case .",
    "more precisely , we show that the number of distinct levels of these chains grows polynomially with the number of spins , whereas for generic yangian - invariant spin models this growth is exponential . as explained in detail in section  [ sec.avdeg ] , the ultimate reason for this different behavior is the fact that spin chains of hs type possess a polynomial dispersion relation . as a matter of fact , our results apply as well to the whole family of vertex models studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , which also have this property .",
    "moreover , when the coefficients of a polynomial dispersion relation are rational numbers ( as is the case for the hs and pf chains , and for the fi chain when its parameter is rational ) we show that the number of distinct levels behaves as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total degree of the dispersion relation .",
    "another aspect of yangian - invariant spin models that we shall analyze in this paper is their connection with one - dimensional anyons .",
    "in fact , it is well known that spin chains of hs type provide one of the simplest realizations of anyons in one dimension via haldane s fractional statistics  @xcite .",
    "for instance , as shown in the latter reference , the spectrum of the @xmath12 hs chain is the same as that of a system of spin @xmath6 anyons with exclusion parameter @xmath13 .",
    "this result was essentially extended to the @xmath14 case in  @xcite , with @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we focus instead on the set of _ distinct _ energy levels of an @xmath14 yangian - invariant spin model , and show that it can be obtained from the spectrum of an effective model of quasi - particles corresponding to the @xmath16 s in a haldane motif  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath12 case this effective model is simply a system of anyons with @xmath17 . in the general @xmath14 case we compute in closed form the statistical weights of these effective models , and use them to derive in a novel way several combinatorial identities for generalized fibonacci numbers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec.yinv ]",
    "we review the description of the representations of the yangian @xmath1 labeled by border strips , and give a precise definition of yangian - invariant @xmath0 spin models .",
    "we also recall the definitions of the @xmath0 spin chains of hs type , and discuss their spectra and dispersion relations .",
    "section  [ sec.adgfn ] is devoted to the computation of the minimum average degeneracy of an arbitrary yangian - invariant spin model , in both the supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric cases .",
    "we apply our results to the @xmath0 supersymmetric version of inozemtsev s elliptic chain  @xcite , showing that in the @xmath12 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( or equivalently @xmath20 ) cases it is _ not _ a yangian invariant spin model for a wide range of values of @xmath3 . using several properties of the generalized fibonacci numbers ,",
    "we also determine the asymptotic behavior of the minimum average degeneracy of a yangian - invariant spin model . in section  [ sec.avdeg-tim ]",
    "we study the average degeneracy of yangian - invariant spin models that are also translationally invariant , like the haldane  shastry chain . as an example",
    ", we consider the @xmath2 inozemtsev chain , which is known to be ( isospectral to ) a yangian- and translationally - invariant spin model  @xcite . as mentioned above , in section  [ sec.avdeg ] we present a detailed analysis of the average degeneracy of spin chains of hs type and , more generally , of yangian - invariant spin models with a polynomial dispersion relation .",
    "in section  [ sec.anyons ] we introduce the effective models describing the set of distinct levels of a non - supersymmetric yangian - invariant spin model , and discuss their interpretation in terms of anyons and their connection with several identities satisfied by generalized fibonacci numbers .",
    "the paper ends with a brief section in which we summarize our main results .",
    "in this section we shall provide a precise definition of the class of yangian - invariant models on which we shall focus in this paper . for the reader s convenience , we shall begin by recalling the precise definition of the yangian  @xmath1 .",
    "following the original paper  @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , we first give an explicit matrix realization of the lie superalgebra  @xmath21 . to this end , let us introduce a @xmath22 grading  @xmath23 in the vector space @xmath24 by setting @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "this induces a natural grading in the space  @xmath29 of @xmath30 complex matrices given by @xmath31 where  @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the canonical basis of @xmath24 , and @xmath34 denotes the matrix whose only nonzero entry is a  @xmath16 in the @xmath35-th row and @xmath36-th column . by definition ,",
    "the lie superalgebra  @xmath21 is the vector space  @xmath29 with the the graded commutator defined by the customary formula @xmath37_\\pm = ab-(-1)^{\\deg a+\\deg b}ba\\ ] ] on matrices with well - defined degree , and extended by linearity to the whole space .",
    "the yangian  @xmath1 is then defined by means of the solution of the yang ",
    "baxter equation given by the @xmath38-matrix @xmath39 where  @xmath40 is the spectral parameter , @xmath41 and  @xmath42 is the graded permutation operator defined by @xmath43 more precisely , @xmath1 is the associative ( complex ) superalgebra with generators @xmath44 defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath45 where the matrix elements @xmath46 are defined by @xmath47 we also introduce a @xmath22 grading in @xmath1 by setting @xmath48 so that the matrix  @xmath49 and the identity matrix @xmath50 are both even . given two even @xmath30 matrices  @xmath51 , @xmath52 with matrix elements in  @xmath1",
    ", we define their graded tensor product by @xmath53 the defining relation for the generators  @xmath54 are then given by the equation @xmath55 where the matrix  @xmath38 is defined by eq .",
    "and we have used the standard notation  @xmath56 , @xmath57 . using the above definition of graded tensor product , it is easy to check that the latter equation is equivalent to the following system for the currents @xmath46 of the yangian  @xmath1 : @xmath58_\\pm=(-1)^{p_{\\alpha}p_{\\gamma}+p_{\\beta}p_{\\gamma}+p_{\\alpha}p_{\\beta}}\\,h\\cdot \\big(t_{{\\gamma}{\\beta}}(u)t_{{\\alpha}{\\delta}}(v)-t_{{\\gamma}{\\beta}}(v)t_{{\\alpha}{\\delta}}(u)\\big)\\,;\\\\ & { \\alpha}\\,,{\\beta}\\,,{\\gamma}\\,,{\\delta}=1,\\dots , m+n\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this system obviously determines the defining relations of the generators  @xmath54 of the yangian superalgebra  @xmath1 through eq .  .",
    "in fact , it is well known that this algebra is actually generated by its lowest two generators  @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the models we shall deal with in this paper are associated to finite - dimensional representations of the yangian @xmath1 labeled by a particular class of skew young diagrams , namely border strips , that we shall describe next .",
    "we shall start with a few preliminary definitions , following for the most part the notation in ref .",
    "skew young diagram _",
    "@xmath61 is the set of boxes obtained by subtracting a young diagram @xmath62 from a larger young diagram @xmath63 .",
    "such a diagram @xmath61 is _ connected _ if for any pair of boxes @xmath64 there is a sequence of adjacent boxes starting with @xmath65 and ending with @xmath66 .",
    "a _ border strip _ is a connected skew young diagram not containing any @xmath67 block of boxes . in other words ,",
    "a border strip is a collection of boxes arranged in columns , such that the top box in each column is adjacent to the bottom box in the column to its right . thus a border strip is determined by a vector @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the number of boxes in the @xmath70-th column , counting from right to left ; cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig.bs ] . for this reason , from now on we shall usually identify a border strip with its corresponding vector of column lengths @xmath71 .    .",
    "]    an @xmath0 _ semi - standard tableau _ ( sst ) is a particular filling of the boxes in a border strip @xmath71 with integers in the range @xmath72 according to the following two rules :    1 .",
    "the integers in each column ( read from top to bottom ) and each row ( read from left to right ) form a nondecreasing sequence .",
    "2 .   the nonnegative ( respectively negative ) integers in each row ( resp .",
    "column ) form an increasing sequence .    the use of the term  @xmath0 in the previous definition is motivated by the fact that , as we shall explain in detail below , these tableaux appear in a natural way in the description of the spectrum of several well known spin chains possessing @xmath0 supersymmetry like , e.g. , the haldane  shastry chain .",
    "we can obviously identify an @xmath0 sst with the sequence @xmath73 of its integers read from top to bottom and from right to left ; we shall call such a sequence the tableau s _ spin configuration_. for instance , the tableau in fig .",
    "[ fig.sst ] is an @xmath74 ( or more generally @xmath0 , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) sst with spin configuration @xmath77 , associated to the border strip @xmath78 .",
    "we shall write @xmath79 to indicate that @xmath80 is the spin configuration of an @xmath0 sst whose underlying border strip is @xmath71 .",
    "we shall also say that two spin configurations @xmath80 , @xmath81 are _ equivalent _ , and use the notation @xmath82 , provided that @xmath83 for a certain border strip @xmath71 .",
    "( : : : ; -3,:::;1,:;-2;0;1,;-1;-1 )    as is well - known , the set of all border strips is in one - to - one correspondence with an important class of finite - dimensional irreducible representations of the yangian @xmath1 whose carrier spaces ( the so called _ tame modules _ )",
    "are irreducible under the action of a distinguished maximal abelian subalgebra of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "given a border strip @xmath71 , the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation is the number of all possible @xmath0 sst associated with @xmath71 .",
    "it is clear that any vector  @xmath84 can be regarded as the spin configuration of the @xmath0 tableau constructed by placing the first component @xmath85 at the top of the first ( rightmost ) column , and then placing each component @xmath86 in the box below ( respectively to the left ) of the @xmath87-th box if @xmath88 , or @xmath89 ( resp .",
    "@xmath90 , or @xmath91 ) .",
    "it immediately follows that the number of all @xmath0 sst with @xmath3 boxes coincides with the number @xmath92 of all spin configurations @xmath84 .",
    "this implies that @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes an irreducible @xmath1-module associated with the border strip @xmath71 and @xmath95 is the set of all partitions of the integer @xmath3 ( with order taken into account ) .",
    "thus the direct sum @xmath96 has the same dimension as the hilbert space of a spin chain with @xmath3 sites and two species of particles , one with @xmath7 and the other with @xmath8 internal degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , there is an important class of yangian - invariant models whose hilbert space decomposes as the direct sum @xmath96 , namely the @xmath0-supersymmetric haldane  shastry and polychronakos  frahm chains  @xcite that we shall now briefly describe .    to begin with ,",
    "the hilbert space of these chains is spanned by the canonical spin basis @xmath97 where the @xmath7 bosonic ( resp .",

    "negative ) values of @xmath86 .",
    "the action of the @xmath0-supersymmetric spin permutation operators @xmath98 ( with @xmath99 ) on the canonical spin basis is then defined by @xmath100 with @xmath101 when @xmath86 and @xmath102 are both fermionic , or when @xmath86 and @xmath102 are of opposite type and the number of fermionic spins occupying the sites @xmath103 is odd . in terms of these operators , the hamiltonians of the @xmath0 hs and pf chains",

    "we shall call any such system a _ yangian - invariant @xmath0 spin model _ with @xmath3 sites .",
    "as we have just seen , this class includes the @xmath0-supersymmetric hs and pf long - range spin chains .",

    "since obviously @xmath130 we must have @xmath131 thus the spectrum of a yangian - invariant spin model can be equivalently described by the function @xmath132 as the set of numbers @xmath133 we shall call @xmath134 the _ energy function _ of the system .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "that the hamiltonian of a yangian - invariant spin model can be expressed as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is any orthonormal basis of the subspace @xmath137 and @xmath110 denotes the motif corresponding to the border strip @xmath71 .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath0 hs and pf chains the energy function is the linear functional @xmath138 with  @xmath139 given by eq .  .",

    "for this reason , our results will also apply to models like the fi chain , whose yangian invariance has not been established but which is known to possess a spectrum of the form   ( with @xmath134 given by  - ) .",

    "this is of course equivalent to finding an upper bound on @xmath142 , a problem which we shall now address .",
    "the key observation in this respect is to note that , by eq .  , @xmath142 is obviously equal to the number of distinct values taken by the energy function @xmath143 , where @xmath110 ranges over the set @xmath144 of all valid @xmath0 motifs with @xmath145 components .",

    "conversely , suppose that the vector @xmath108 contains no sequence of @xmath7 or more consecutive 1 s .",
    "such a @xmath110 can be written as a succession of sequences of consecutive 0 s and 1 s of the form @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "it is immediate to check that the spin configuration @xmath164 where each entry is in the range @xmath161 on account of the condition @xmath163 , determines an @xmath14 sst whose corresponding motif is @xmath110 .",

    "it immediately follows from these two facts that the sets @xmath165 and @xmath167 are mapped bijectively into each other by the duality transformation @xmath168 hence @xmath169 so that from now on we shall restrict ourselves without loss of generality to the purely bosonic case .",
    "the duality transformation   actually arises from a mapping defined on spin configurations  @xcite , valid also in the general supersymmetric case .",
    "more precisely , given an @xmath0 spin configuration @xmath80 define the vector @xmath170 by @xmath171 it is immediate to check that @xmath81 is a valid @xmath172 spin configuration , and that @xmath173 where @xmath174 is defined by eq .  .",

    "@xmath449 takes only integer values , so that @xmath450 where @xmath451 and @xmath412 denote respectively the minimum and maximum energies . from the inequality @xmath452 where @xmath453 is the total degree of @xmath140 as a polynomial in @xmath454",
    ", we immediately obtain @xmath455 and hence @xmath456 note that this equation is in agreement with the asymptotic behavior of the bounds   for the pf , hs and fi chains ( with @xmath445 in the latter case ) .",
    "the elementary excitations of certain quantum many - body systems can be described in terms of _ anyons _ , i.e. , effective quasi - particles obeying neither the bose  einstein nor the fermi  dirac statistics  @xcite .",
    "the original definition of anyons is intrinsically two - dimensional , since it requires that the wave function change by a suitable phase under exchange of two identical particles , which is only consistent in two dimensions .",
    "an alternative definition of anyons in terms of a generalized exclusion principle was proposed by haldane  @xcite . according to this definition , in a system of ( identical , non - interacting ) anyons the number of available one - particle states ( or _ orbitals _ ) decreases by @xmath457 when the number of particles increases by @xmath458 .",
    "the constant @xmath459 , which must be a rational number , is called haldane s _ exclusion parameter_. clearly , bosons and fermions have exclusion parameter @xmath460 and @xmath461 , respectively .",
    "the advantage of haldane s definition is that , in contrast with the original one , it is also valid in one dimension .",
    "for instance , it is well known that when the coupling constant is a nonnegative integer @xmath65 the spectrum of the @xmath3-particle calogero model  @xcite is that of a system of @xmath3 free anyons with exclusion parameter @xmath462 in a harmonic oscillator potential  ( see , e.g. , the review paper  @xcite ) .",
    "another important example of one - dimensional anyons is furnished by the @xmath12 haldane  shastry chain , whose `` spinon '' excitations ( in the antiferromagnetic case ) are known to be anyons with @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "it should be clear that this property is in fact shared by _ all _ @xmath12 ( fermionic or bosonic ) yangian - invariant spin models , regardless of their energy function . to see this ,",
    "consider an @xmath12 ( say , bosonic ) motif @xmath110 and its associated border strip @xmath463 , where @xmath464 is the number of spins . in the @xmath12 case ,",
    "it is a simple matter to compute the dimension of the corresponding @xmath465-module @xmath466 .",
    "indeed , a ( bosonic ) @xmath12 border strip @xmath71 can not contain rows with more than two boxes .",
    "moreover , any tableau corresponding to @xmath71 must necessarily contain the sequence @xmath332 ( from left to right ) in any row with two boxes .",
    "the dimension of @xmath467 is thus given by the number of ways of filling the remaining ( `` empty '' ) boxes in each column of the border strip @xmath71 ( from top to bottom ) with sequences of the form @xmath468 ( where the number of 0 s or 1 s can of course be zero ) .",
    "thus the @xmath343 columns of @xmath71 play the role of available orbitals , and its @xmath469 empty boxes that of particles with two internal degrees of freedom ( 0 or 1 ) .",
    "( these particles are obviously bosons , since each orbital can be occupied by more than one particle with the same quantum numbers . )",
    "thus in this case we have @xmath470 and @xmath471 , so that haldane s definition is satisfied with @xmath13 .",
    "this shows that _ any _ @xmath12 yangian - invariant model is indeed equivalent to a system of anyons with two internal degrees of freedom and exclusion parameter @xmath13 ( _ semions _ , in haldane s terminology ) .",
    "haldane s definition of anyons can be equivalently formulated in terms of the total number of states in a system with @xmath11 anyons and @xmath472 one - particle states ( or _ orbitals _ ) . indeed , for anyons with exclusion parameter @xmath459 this number is given by @xmath473 when @xmath459 is a natural number , a very simple realization of this statistics can be obtained by considering a system of @xmath11 particles and @xmath472 orbitals satisfying the following generalized pauli exclusion principle : two occupied orbitals must be separated by at least @xmath474 empty ones .",
    "this requirement is clearly reminiscent of the rule satisfied by the bosonic @xmath12 motifs .",
    "more precisely , we can interpret such a motif @xmath475 as encoding a state of a quantum system with @xmath145 orbitals ( the components of @xmath110 ) , with a 1 indicating an occupied orbital and 0 an empty one . with this interpretation ,",
    "the 1 s in the motif @xmath110 are quasi - particles satisfying the generalized pauli principle with @xmath17 , and thus can be regarded as anyons with exclusion parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this point of view is particularly natural when the energy function is linear ( cf .",
    ", as is the case with spin chains of haldane  shastry type ( cf .  eqs .  - ) .",
    "indeed , for such yangian - invariant models the energy function can be written as @xmath476 where @xmath477 is the position of the @xmath70-th 1 in @xmath110 .",
    "it should be stressed that this interpretation is not equivalent to the one discussed above in terms of spinons , for which @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , in the latter interpretation the 1 s in the motif ( or , more accurately , the sequences @xmath478 ) simply separate the orbitals , while the remaining 0 s correspond to the particles .",
    "in particular , a fundamental difference between both interpretations is that in the new one the degeneracy associated to each motif ( that is , the dimension of the corresponding invariant module @xmath479 ) is not taken into account .",
    "for this reason , the new interpretation defines a different type of system , whose hilbert space dimension equals the number @xmath416 of distinct @xmath12 motifs . since @xmath416 is given by the fibonacci number @xmath480 ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) , from eq .   with @xmath481 and @xmath17",
    "we obtain the remarkable identity @xmath482 where the upper limit is determined by the condition @xmath483 . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath484-th fibonacci number is obtained by diagonally summing the binomial coefficients arranged in a pascal triangle  @xcite .",
    "this classical number - theoretic result can thus be interpreted as expressing the dimension of the hilbert space of a system of @xmath17 anyons with @xmath145 orbitals in terms of the corresponding dimensions of its @xmath11-particle subspaces .",
    "motivated by the previous discussion , we shall next consider the bosonic @xmath14 motifs with @xmath485 as representing the states of a system of quasi - particles ( namely , the 1 s in the motif ) with @xmath145 orbitals ( the motif s components ) , subject to the exclusion principle that there can be no more than @xmath486 consecutive occupied orbitals .",
    "as before , this rule obviously does not take into account the degeneracy associated to each motif , so that the system under consideration is _ not _ an @xmath14 yangian - invariant spin model .",
    "it can instead be regarded as an effective model , whose spectrum   reproduces the set of _ distinct _ energy levels of a generic ( bosonic ) @xmath14 yangian - invariant spin model with linear energy function and dispersion relation @xmath140 .",
    "we shall next compute the statistical weight @xmath487 for the new system just introduced . to this end , let @xmath488 be a bosonic @xmath14 motif with @xmath489 single 1 s ( i.e. , @xmath490 sequences ) , @xmath491 double 1 s ( i.e , @xmath492 sequences ) ,  , and @xmath493 sequences @xmath494 , with @xmath495 removing the zero in each sequence @xmath490 , @xmath490 in each sequence @xmath492 ,  ,",
    "@xmath496 in each sequence @xmath494 , except for the zero ( if any ) following the last 1 in the motif , we are left with a sequence @xmath497 containing @xmath498 @xmath16 s .",
    "conversely , it is clear that from _ any _ such vector @xmath497 one can construct a bosonic @xmath14 motif with @xmath489 single 1 s , @xmath491 double 1 s ,  , and @xmath493 sequences @xmath494 by adding a zero after @xmath489 1 s , the sequence @xmath490 after @xmath491 of the remaining 1 s , etc .",
    "thus , the number @xmath499 of motifs with @xmath489 single 1 s , @xmath491 double 1 s , etc . , is given by the number of ways of choosing the positions of the @xmath489 1 s starting a sequence @xmath490 , the @xmath491 1 s starting a sequence @xmath492 , etc .",
    ", among the integers @xmath500 .",
    "in other words , @xmath501 the statistical weight @xmath487 is the sum of all @xmath499 whose arguments  @xmath502 satisfy  , namely @xmath503 note that for @xmath193 this equation obviously reduces to eq .",
    "with @xmath17 and @xmath481 .",
    "eliminating @xmath489 with the help of eq .   and explicitly enforcing the condition @xmath504 arising from the first factor in the denominator we obtain the equivalent expression @xmath505 for instance",
    ", for @xmath219 we have @xmath506 the total dimension of the system s hilbert space , which is the same as the number @xmath189 of bosonic @xmath14 motifs for a yangian - invariant spin model with @xmath3 spins , is obtained by summing the statistical weight @xmath487 over all possible values of @xmath11 . if @xmath507 with @xmath508 , the maximum value of @xmath11 is clearly @xmath509 since @xmath510 . from eqs .   and",
    "we finally obtain the identity @xmath511 an alternative version of the latter equation follows by using eq .   for @xmath487 and eliminating @xmath11 using eq .  ,",
    "namely @xmath512 this is essentially the classical combinatorial expression for the generalized fibonacci numbers proved in  @xcite ( cf .",
    "( @xmath513 ) in the latter reference ) .",
    "it is apparent from eqs .",
    "( with @xmath514 and   that for @xmath485 the quasi - particles associated to the ( bosonic ) @xmath14 motifs of a yangian - invariant spin model are not anyons .",
    "note , however , that there is a generalization of haldane s definition  , due to murthy and shankar  @xcite , to systems with an infinite - dimensional one - particle hilbert space .",
    "the latter generalization is essentially based on the behavior of the statistical weight   as the number of orbitals @xmath472 tends to infinity for any fixed @xmath11 , namely @xmath515 from which it follows that @xmath516 this observation suggests looking at the asymptotic behavior of the density of states   as @xmath517 with @xmath11 fixed . to this end , note",
    "first of all that @xmath518 on account of the restriction @xmath519 , and that @xmath520 thus the leading terms in the sum   are obtained for @xmath521 and @xmath522 , @xmath523 , or more precisely @xmath524 using eqs  - with @xmath17 to expand the first term on the rhs we immediately obtain @xmath525 thus as @xmath526 with @xmath11 fixed the density of states   satisfies eq .   with @xmath461 .",
    "note that , as already observed by murthy and shankar , if the system s maximum and minimum energies are independent of @xmath472 ( or , more generally , the spectrum is bounded by @xmath472-independent constants ) the limit @xmath526 with @xmath11 fixed can be naturally interpreted as the continuum limit .",
    "we conclude that in the continuum limit the ( bosonic ) @xmath14 motifs with @xmath485 behave as a system of _ fermions _ , according to murthy and shankar s definition .",
    "in this paper we consider a wide class of finite - dimensional yangian - invariant quantum models which we have called yangian - invariant spin models closely related to representations of the yangian @xmath1 labeled by border strips .",
    "this class includes several widely studied systems , such as spin chains of haldane  shastry type and certain families of one - dimensional vertex models .",
    "a common feature of all yangian - invariant spin models is the relatively high degeneracy of their spectrum , essentially due to their symmetry under the yangian . as a quantitative measure of the degree of degeneracy of these models",
    ", we compute in closed form the intrinsic average degeneracy of any such model stemming from its yangian invariance .",
    "it turns out that , in the non - supersymmetric case , this minimum average degeneracy is expressed in terms of generalized fibonacci numbers . using several fundamental properties of these numbers , we derive the asymptotic behavior of the minimum average degeneracy as the number of spins tends to infinity .",
    "our results provide a stringent test for a quantum system to be a yangian - invariant spin model . as an example",
    ", we apply this test to the @xmath0 supersymmetric version of inozemtsev chain , which has been studied in the context of the gauge - string duality as a candidate for reproducing the spectrum of the dilation operator at several loops ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we have also refined the previous results on the minimum average degeneracy for models that are in addition translationally invariant , both in the @xmath0-supersymmetric and in the simplest @xmath12 cases .",
    "the second main problem that we address in this paper is the analysis of the precise role played by the yangian symmetry in the high degeneracy of the spectra of spin chains of haldane  shastry type .",
    "we show that these chains are much more degenerate than generic yangian - invariant spin models , since the number of distinct levels grows polynomially for the former systems and exponentially for the latter .",
    "this accidental degeneracy is essentially due to the polynomial character of the dispersion relation , and is therefore shared by the family of one - dimensional vertex models studied in refs .",
    "moreover , if the coefficients in the dispersion relation are rational numbers ( as is the case for the hs and pf chains ) , we show that the accidental degeneracy is even higher , as illustrated by the fi chain with a rational vs.  irrational parameter .",
    "finally , we consider an effective model of quasi - particles describing the distinct energy levels of a non - supersymmetric yangian - invariant spin model . we show that in the @xmath12 case these quasi - particles are anyons with exclusion parameter @xmath17 , while in the @xmath14 case with @xmath485 they become fermions in the continuum limit .",
    "we also provide a simple interpretation of several combinatorial expressions for @xmath7-nacci numbers in terms of the statistical weights of the effective model of @xmath14 quasi - particles .",
