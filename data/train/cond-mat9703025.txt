    "granular materials display a variety of unusual behaviour not normally associated with either solids or liquids  @xcite .",
    "one such example is the segregation that occurs when a mixture of different sized granules is repeatedly shaken , in which the larger particles rise to the top  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a granular mixture placed inside a rotating cylinder segregates into alternate bands along the cylinder s axis  @xcite .",
    "segregation in the absence of external perturbations has recently been demonstrated for a mixture poured between two vertical plates separated by a narrow gap  @xcite .",
    "a _ sandpile _",
    "forms in which particles of different sizes tend to remain near the top or bottom . moreover , certain mixtures also _ self - stratify _ into alternating layers parallel to the surface of the pile .",
    "it is this segregation in sandpiles that this paper seeks to address .",
    "a sandpile is formed by the addition of particles which then move over the surface of the pile until finding a resting place . modelling this process is a highly non - trivial problem even without the added complication of mixtures of particles .",
    "there are two basic approaches to modelling the surface transport of pure granular media .",
    "firstly , bak  _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite introduced a cellular automata model as a paradigm of their more general concept of self - organised criticality . in this model ,",
    "sequentially added particles can initiate a series of locally - defined topples known collectively as an _ avalanche_. the system is said to be _ slowly driven _ as the timescale for particle injection is infinitely slower than that of the subsequent avalanche  @xcite . however , experimental evidence  @xcite disagrees with the model s predicted power - law distribution of avalanche sizes , except possibly in the limit of overdamped particle motion  @xcite .",
    "a second approach treats the sandpile as a continuum with a fluid _ rolling layer _ interacting with the static bulk of the pile .",
    "analysis of the field equations of this model appears to give a greater correspondence with the experiments  @xcite .",
    "variations of both discrete and continuous approaches have been used to try and explain the behaviour observed in the sandpile formed by pouring a mixture between two plates . a discrete model , in which the particles are added in groups and also move downslope in groups , exhibits self - stratification but gives no insights into the mechanism responsible for the formation of the layers .",
    "however , extending the continuum rate equations to incorporate mixtures demonstrates the existence of a _ kink _ , which back - propagates up the slope forming two layers at once , giving a possible explanation of the experimental results  @xcite .    in this paper , and in contrast to the experiments  @xcite and their subsequent analysis  @xcite",
    ", we consider a slowly driven system in which particles are added individually rather than being poured .",
    "the entire pile is stable between particle additions and there is no formation of a rolling layer .",
    "the model we have chosen to study is a one - dimensional cellular automata with mixed particle types , based on the model in  @xcite , which has no avalanching in one - dimension . for binary mixtures we observe four broad classes of sandpile structure as the relative strengths of the interactions between the particles",
    "are varied .",
    "two of these classes correspond to the self - segregation and self - stratification observed in the rolling layer case .",
    "the algorithm for the model is described in sec.[sec : model ] .",
    "the four classes of behaviour are described and their evolution explained in sec.[sec : results ] , and the results for mixtures with more than two particle types are also given .",
    "in sec.[sec : disc ] we discuss how experiments to observe these classes might proceed .",
    "the sandpile profile is described by the set of heights , where all the @xmath5 are initially set to zero .",
    "an infinite wall at serves as a lower bound for @xmath6 , whereas there is no upper bound on the values of @xmath6 . at each time step",
    ", a particle is chosen from one of @xmath0 possible types , where each particle has the same dimensions and is chosen with equal probability . a particle of type",
    "is then added to the top of site  1 and subsequently slides to the first site   that obeys , where and @xmath7 is the type of particle currently on the surface at site  @xmath6 .",
    "the particle is added to the top of site  @xmath6 , and another particle can now be added to the system .",
    "an example of this process is given in fig.[f : example ] .",
    "the @xmath1 parameters @xmath8 correspond to the maximum slope on which a particle of type  @xmath9 can remain on top of a particle of type  @xmath7 without sliding off .",
    "a pure pile of just type  @xmath9 particles has uniform slope @xmath10 , so can be identified as the _ angle of repose_. the @xmath8 for are microscopically defined quantities with no obvious macroscopic counterparts .",
    "generally , since the critical slope will depend upon which type of particle is moving on top of the pile , for instance types @xmath9 and @xmath7 may have different densities . due to the complex nature of granular surface - to - surface interactions",
    "it is unclear how much of this parameter space corresponds to physical reality .",
    "the labels for each particle type are just dummy variables , so without loss of generality we choose to fix .",
    "for @xmath2 the system reduces to the original model which is trivial in one dimension  @xcite . for @xmath3 and @xmath11",
    "there are four classes of solution , which we label i to iv .",
    "each class can be identified according to the _ domain stability _ of each particle type , which is defined as follows .",
    "a compact region of sites with surface composition of particle type  @xmath9 is stable if it can reach a uniform slope @xmath10 such that particles of type  @xmath12 will slide through the region  that is , if @xmath13 .",
    "unstable regions can only form in instances where there is no incoming flux of particles of the other type , which may occur towards the right - hand side of the sandpile .",
    "we now describe each of the four classes in turn .",
    "_ class i : @xmath14 and @xmath15 . _",
    "neither particle type can form stable domains and particles will usually come to rest on particles of the other type .",
    "we call this _",
    "periodic mixing_. an example of such a sandpile is given in fig.[f : ex_pm ] .",
    "this behaviour can be demonstrated by the following single - site analysis . a site with an uppermost particle of type  @xmath9 and slope @xmath16 is represented by @xmath17 .",
    "then the transition amplitude for a particle of type  @xmath7 coming to rest on this site , , is given by the particle addition operator @xmath18 defined by    @xmath19    where .",
    "low values for @xmath16 are transitory , but for large @xmath16 added particles slide through , possibly coming to rest on site and reducing @xmath16 by 1 . hence the bulk properties of the sandpile will be characterised by the action of @xmath20 in the region of large @xmath16 .",
    "an example is given in fig.[f : phase ] for the case , which clearly shows periodicity for @xmath16 near the maximum slope , which in this case is @xmath21 .",
    "note that for we do not have strict periodicity as type  2 particles are occasionally added consecutively .    _ class ii : @xmath14 and @xmath22 . _ a stable domain of type  2 particles with uniform slope @xmath23 builds up to the left of the sandpile , and type  1 particles slide through to the right forming a domain with uniform slope @xmath24 .",
    "the result is _ discrete self - segregation _ , as the example in fig.[f : ex_dss ] demonstrates .",
    "the boundary between the two domains moves to the right as particles of type  2 come to rest on sites with slope @xmath24 , so if @xmath25 some periodic mixing may occur .",
    "if @xmath26 , the mixing remains confined to a narrow layer at the boundary , but if @xmath27 it expands to the bulk of the pile , giving a sandpile similar in appearance to case of the periodic mixing described previously .",
    "the self - segregation and boundary behaviour can also be seen from the phase portraits of the particle addition operator @xmath18 .",
    "we justify referring to the case as discrete self - segregation by the observation that the region of periodic mixing collapses to a much narrower layer under most small alterations in the dynamical rules .",
    "we will return to this point later when we discuss the robustness of the model .",
    "it is possible to construct a global solution of this class of sandpiles .",
    "define @xmath28 and @xmath29 to be position of the boundary and the right - hand edge of the sandpile respectively , so that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , all sites   have type  2 particle on top and all sites   have type  1 particles on top .",
    "a type  2 particle added to @xmath32 will reduce the slope of site  @xmath33 by 1 , so the next type  2 particle added will stop at @xmath33 , then @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and so on . similarly , type  1 particles will be added to @xmath29 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , in that order .",
    "@xmath29 will move to the right by one step when @xmath38 increases from 0 to @xmath24 , so in the continuum limit    @xmath39    where the time scale has been normalised to one particle addition of either type per unit time .",
    "the slope at @xmath28 increases with each type  2 particle that stops on @xmath28 and decreases with each type  1 particle that stops on @xmath40 , and since @xmath28 increases by one whenever the slope increases from @xmath24 to @xmath23 we get    @xmath41    a steadily evolving sandpile corresponds to a constant ratio , so    @xmath42    using this together with  ( [ eq : dl ] ) and  ( [ eq : dlb ] ) , we find    @xmath43    giving the average slope of the entire pile as    @xmath44    in agreement with simulations  @xcite .    _ class iii : @xmath45 and @xmath15 .",
    "_ it might be expected that self - segregation will also occur here , this time with type  1 particles to the left of the boundary . however , since @xmath11 the type  2 particles to the right of the boundary form steeper slopes than the type  1 particles to the left , and so now the boundary moves upslope rather than downslope , creating a double layer of 2 s on top of 1 s .",
    "once the boundary reaches the left - hand wall , a thin layer of 1 s quickly cover the surface of the whole sandpile , the boundary returns to the bottom and starts propagating upwards once more .",
    "this moving interface corresponds to the kink described in the rolling layer case  @xcite , and , indeed , the region of parameter space in which it occurs is the same .",
    "however , there are 3 significant differences between the nature of the self - stratification formed by this slowly - driven process and that formed by rolling layers .",
    "( i )  the slope of the layers varies between @xmath24 and @xmath23 , as opposed to the uniform slope of @xmath23 observed in the rolling layer case .",
    "( ii )  the layers are narrower , typically just one particle wide .",
    "( iii )  the rate at which the interface moves is no longer a constant but varies according to statistical fluctuations in the types of incoming particles .",
    "it is even possible for the interface to stop moving altogether , resulting in a vertical build - up of particles that is reminiscent of a miniature self - segregated sandpile .",
    "however , this state is unstable and the interface will eventually start moving again , either upslope to continue the layering process or quickly downslope to the bottom of the pile .",
    "thus , layers can now start and stop in the bulk of the pile .",
    "an example of a self - stratified sandpile is given in fig.[f : ex_l ] .",
    "_ class iv : @xmath45 and @xmath22 .",
    "_ in this final class , alternating stable domains of 1 s and 2 s form parallel vertical bands .",
    "an example of this _ vertical stratification _ is given in fig.[f : ex_vs ] .",
    "the phase portrait of @xmath18 for this class demonstrates the separation of the particle types , but further analysis requires some knowledge of the global solution .",
    "once the slope of the site at the right - hand edge of any domain decreases by one , a single layer of particles of similar type back - propagates to the left - hand edge , when the adjacent domain will undergo a similar process .",
    "thus the bulk of the sandpile builds up a layer at a time in this piecewise fashion , from the bottom of the pile to the top .",
    "the process that initially generates each domain depends upon the interaction between the bulk of the sandpile and the qualitatively different _",
    "end region _ at the far right - hand side . in the end region , a layer of 2 s of thickness back - propagates to the first domain of type  2 particles .",
    "the domain then broadens to the right , and the process is repeated .",
    "alternatively , if the back - propagating layer of 2 s can be stopped prematurely by an incoming flux of 1 s , resulting in the formation of a new stable domain of type  1 particles . since the particles that flow into the end region are precisely those that did _ not _ stop in the bulk of the pile , the number of domains of each different type tends to remain equal , although the domains themselves get broader as the end region expands .",
    "if the formation of new type  1 domains can still occur when the sandpile is small is small due to statistical fluctuations , but this rarely occurs for larger piles which take on a self - segregated appearance .    a diagram of the parameter space showing the regions in which each of these classes occurs is given in fig.[f : param ] .",
    "the borders between these regions correspond to or , when domain stability is not well defined . in these cases",
    "the sandpile behaviour is either indeterminate between the two classes in question or just reduces to random mixing . for periodic",
    "mixing and vertical stratification are unaffected but there is no longer any distinction between discrete self - segregation and self - stratification . instead",
    ", these two classes are replaced with a hybrid class that exhibits self - segregation with a broad , layered boundary .",
    "each class is said to be _ robust _ if its existence is insensitive to the exact choice of dynamical rules .",
    "it is possible to vary the volumes of each particle type added or to introduce an open or closed right - hand boundary condition without any significant alteration in the resultant sandpile .",
    "similarly , initially adding the particles over a range of sites does not affect the sandpile to the right of the range , and introducing annealed disorder to the @xmath8 just increases the noise .",
    "more significant is the effect of averaging the @xmath8 over adjacent pairs of sites , corresponding perhaps to the nestling of the upper particle in between the two lower ones , which destroys vertical stratification and instead gives random mixing or discrete self - segregation . crudely modelling inertia by allowing the moving particle to stochastically",
    "drift a short distance further than normal distorts vertical stratification and replaces layering and periodic mixing with random mixing .",
    "we conclude that the model is robust except when we include displacements in the particle s horizontal motion .    for @xmath4",
    "the parameter space for @xmath8 becomes too large to explore systematically .",
    "the situation improves somewhat if only domain stability is considered , but this still leaves possible combinations , so we have limited ourselves to a brief survey of all these cases for @xmath46 and a representative sample for @xmath47 .",
    "the resultant sandpiles are essentially just combinations of the four classes identified for @xmath3 , the only significant new feature being that periodic mixing can now occur with periodicity .",
    "any particle separation and the allowed orders of periodic mixing can be predicted in each case by extending the particle addition operator to include .",
    "as before , there is no generic way of constructing global solutions but in many cases known solutions for @xmath48 particle systems can be used instead .",
    "this is possible when particle types  @xmath9 and @xmath7 would by themselves periodically mix , when to good approximation they can be replaced by a single particle type  @xmath49 which alternates between the two .",
    "a domain is stable to @xmath49 only if it is stable to both @xmath9 and @xmath7 , a domain of type  @xmath49 particles is stable to another type only if both @xmath9 and @xmath7 are , and .",
    "this reduced system usually exhibits the correct qualitative structure of the original but significantly underestimates the amount of noise .",
    "the discrete model studied here is perhaps the simplest conceivable model describing slowly driven sandpile formation with granular mixtures .",
    "nonetheless it exhibits a wide variety of non - trivial behaviour in one - dimension , and we can only suppose that it will continue to do so in higher dimensions .",
    "the behaviour of sandpiles for binary mixtures falls into one of four classes , two of which have known counterparts in the rolling layer model  @xcite .",
    "they are also much more susceptible to statistical fluctuations in the order of particle types added .",
    "we have recently initiated a series of experiments in an attempt to reproduce these classes with real granular materials  @xcite . on first inspection",
    ", there may appear to be little hope that such a simple model could describe real sandpile mixtures .",
    "for instance , the possibility of particles bouncing or dislodging surface material has not been catered for . however , our numerical investigations into the robustness of the model leads us to suppose that agreement might be possible in the limit of overdamped particle motion .",
    "it is also important to realise the limit of infinitely slow driving as closely as possible , to minimise the probability of a rolling layer forming , because even a thin rolling layer would displace surface material along the length of the slope .",
    "this would interfere with the formation of both vertical stratification and periodic mixing .    in summary ,",
    "sandpile formation by granular mixtures exhibits a greater diversity of behaviour in the slowly driven limit than in the rolling layer case , at least numerically .",
    "if toppling were included into this model  @xcite , more than one particle would be able to move simultaneously in the form of an avalanche .",
    "similarly , allowing moving particles to dislodge surface material in some manner might allow for something akin to a rolling layer to form .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the system diversity was reduced in either of these two cases .",
    "we would like to thank peter hobson for useful discussions ."
