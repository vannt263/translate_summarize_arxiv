    "numerical relativity simulations of binary black holes have matured dramatically in recent years . starting with the first complete simulations of binary black hole mergers @xcite , a large number of papers on mergers of binaries with varying mass ratios and black hole spins have appeared .",
    "some of the results of these simulations , including the surprisingly large recoil speed of the merger remnant for certain spin orientations ( e.g.  @xcite ) , have also triggered numerous studies of the astrophysical consequences of these findings .",
    "many numerical simulations of black holes adopt the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) formulation of einstein s equations @xcite together with moving - puncture coordinates @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . the latter consist of the 1+log slicing condition for the lapse @xcite and the @xmath5-driver gauge condition for the shift @xcite .",
    "the role of these coordinates in stabilizing the numerical simulations has been clarified by considering the late - time behavior of spatial slices of the schwarzschild spacetime when evolved with moving - puncture coordinates @xcite . in particular , these studies showed that , at late times , these slices form a ",
    "trumpet \" geometry , meaning that the slices asymptotically approach a finite areal radius and never reach the spacetime singularity ( see fig .  2 in @xcite for an embedding diagram that motivates the name of this geometry ) .",
    "several groups have also started to simulate black holes in higher dimensions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "some of these studies aim at exploring the rich geometric structure of black holes in higher dimensions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while others are motived by speculations that miniature black holes might be created in high - energy collisions in particle colliders ( e.g.  the lhc ) , a scenario that requires additional spacelike dimensions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a review ) .    motivated by the success of the bssn formalism with moving - puncture coordinates in @xmath6 spacetime dimensions , several of the above simulations",

    "we analyze the late - time behavior of spatial slices of spherically symmetric solutions in @xmath2 spacetime dimensions when they are evolved with moving - puncture coordinates .",
    "more specifically , we construct stationary @xmath8 slices of the schwarzschild - tangherlini spacetime @xcite , the spherically symmetric vacuum black hole solution for @xmath9 . we demonstrate that , as for @xmath6 , these slices display a trumpet geometry . parameterizing the @xmath8 slicing condition with a parameter @xmath3",

    "we conclude with a brief summary in section [ summary ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt units in which the speed of light is unity , @xmath12",
    ". however , we do not set to unity the gravitational constant @xmath13 of a @xmath1-dimensional spacetime , since keeping @xmath13 in the analytical expressions makes their units more transparent .",
    "the generalization of the schwarzschild spacetime , which describes spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in @xmath6 spacetime dimensions , to higher dimensions @xmath1 is the schwarzschild - tangherlini solution @xcite . adopting the notation of @xcite",

    ", @xmath31 is the generalization of the schwarzschild ( or areal ) radius . in numerical applications",
    ", it is often convenient to express the metric in terms of an isotropic radius @xmath32 , so that the spatial part of the metric can be transformed to cartesian coordinates very easily . to do so , we set the spatial part of the line element ( [ stle ] ) equal to its isotropic counterpart , @xmath33 where the exponent on the conformal factor @xmath34 has been chosen for convenience . from the identification ( [ toisotropic ] ) we see that @xmath35 and @xmath36 eliminating @xmath34 we now find @xmath37 integrating both sides of the equation we obtain @xcite @xmath38 or , solving for @xmath31 , @xmath39 inserting this into ( [ relaterr ] ) we find the conformal factor @xmath40 as expected , these results reduce to the usual schwarzschild expressions for @xmath6 . in section [ numworksection ] we will adopt the above expressions for @xmath4 as initial data .    in order to explore alternative slicings ( or foliations ) of the schwarzschild - tangherlini spacetime in sections [ maxslicsection ] and [ 1pluslogsection ]",
    "we now introduce a new time coordinate @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the height function @xcite . as we will see in the following sections , different slicing conditions result in different ordinary differential equations for @xmath42 . with the new time",

    "for @xmath75 the height function @xmath76 must be constant , the spacetime is therefore sliced by slices of constant schwarschild - tangherlini time @xmath77 , and we recover the metric ( [ stle ] ) .",
    "the other member of the family that we will be interested in is that for which the slice ends with a double - root of the squared lapse ( [ alphaf ] ) .",
