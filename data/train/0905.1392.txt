    "in the widely discussed internal shock scenario ( see , e.g. , reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is due to collisions among inhomogeneities within ultrarelativistic outflows , which lead to formation of shocks .",
    "the nonthermal photons , whose typical energy @xmath1 a few hundred kev , are emitted from shock - accelerated electrons in highly magnetized plasma .",
    "however , several open problems for the internal shock model have been pointed out such as the radiative efficiency , various kinds of luminosity correlations , and so on . in this paper , we focus on the two open problems : the energy transfer problem and the low - energy spectral index problem .",
    "the standard model postulates that a large fraction of the kinetic energy carried by protons should be efficiently converted into that of relativistic electrons .",
    "however , it is apparent that the coulomb interaction can not transport the internal energy of heated protons into electrons to achieve energy equipartition , because the timescale of the coulomb interaction is much longer than the dynamical timescale .",
    "while the simple first - order fermi acceleration at the shock front is assumed to transfer the energy into electrons in the standard model , some unknown plasma processes may play an important role in the energy transfer .",
    "the second problem is in the spectral shape of the prompt emission .",
    "the observed spectra of grbs are well fitted with the conventional band function @xcite ; the photon number spectrum @xmath2}$ ] below @xmath3 , and @xmath4 above it .",
    "the typical fitted value of the low energy spectral index is @xmath5 @xcite , while the standard model predicts that photons from cooled electrons dominate the low energy region below @xmath6 , which leads to @xmath7 . to resolve this problem several alternative models , such as the thermal emission from photosphere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , have been considered .",
    "the klein - nishina effect on synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process , which can affect the low energy synchrotron spectrum , has been discussed frequently @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested that the decay of magnetic fields (  [ sec : dec ] ) may resolve the problem in the low energy spectral index .",
    "however , in that model , we have not yet found a reason why the decay timescale should always be comparable to the cooling timescale (  [ sec : model ] ) . in a particle - in - cell ( pic )",
    "simulation for electron - positron plasma @xcite , the decay timescale is close to the requirement of @xcite , but long - term evolution of magnetic fields is still controversial , partially because the effect of accelerated particles is not quantitatively unveiled yet @xcite .    motivated by these problems , we propose an alternative model for the prompt emission of grbs (  [ sec : simple ] ) . in our model",
    "electron - heating ( second - order fermi acceleration ) due to plasma turbulence continues during photon emission in shocked plasmas @xcite , so that the resultant spectral index of low energy photons can be consistent with the observations at least below @xmath0 mev .",
    "since the assumed heating timescale is longer than that in the standard scenario , we call this model the `` slow heating model '' . after the free energy for the plasma instabilities",
    "is dissipated , the magnetic fields may decay and the synchrotron emission will cease . the further possibility to reproduce mev - gev power - law spectra within the framework of this model",
    "is discussed in  [ sec : var ] .",
    "in addition , our model naturally predicts delayed gev - tev emission due to inverse compton ( ic ) and broad pulse profile of optical emission under certain conditions (  [ sec : del ] ) .",
    "finally , we summarize the results of our model , and compare them with the observed luminosity correlations in grbs (  [ sec : sum ] ) .",
    "we should note that our synchrotron model is different from the ic models using the same terminology `` slow heating '' in @xcite and @xcite , in which the electrons are heated slowly in a timescale comparable to the shell - expansion timescale @xcite .",
    "in the standard scenario , the magnetic fields are assumed to be generated / amplified in the region around shocks via plasma instabilities , such as the weibel instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the two - stream instability due to high - energy particles accelerated at the shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the difference in temperatures of electrons and protons may also arouse some plasma instabilities . generated magnetic fields efficiently",
    "interact with particles , whose larmor radii are comparable to the typical scale of the turbulence .",
    "this situation is definitely different from the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation .",
    "for example , where the electron larmor radii are finite , the off - diagonal terms in the electron pressure tensor could appear and catalyze magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the energy of magnetosonic perturbations can be transferred to resonant particles via the transit - time damping process ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to consider that the generated magnetic fields may decay via interaction with particles after the free energy for instability excitation ( anisotropy , inhomogeneity , different temperatures of electrons and ions etc . )",
    "is dissipated with a decay timescale @xmath8 .",
    "actually , recent pic simulations of electron - positron plasmas show that magnetic turbulences induced by the weibel instability decay ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for @xmath9 , electrons stop emitting photons via synchrotron radiation .",
    "therefore , the decay of magnetic fields may suppress the photon emission from cooled electrons , which resolves the problem in the index @xmath10 .",
    "first let us revisit the effects of decay of magnetic fields with the standard manner of the electron injection . in figure",
    "[ fig : test ] , changing the decay timescale , we show grb spectra obtained by numerical calculations with the same code in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* details will be explained in the following section ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "all spectra are shown in terms of the observed fluence versus photon energy , assuming a grb redshift of @xmath11 .",
    "the vertical axes denote @xmath12 , so that photon spectra with a spectral index @xmath10 are plotted as @xmath13 .",
    "the model parameters are estimated as follows .",
    "the emitting region for a pulse is a homogeneous shell expanding with the lorentz factor @xmath14 at radius @xmath15 from the central engine .",
    "we adopt @xmath16 for the comoving width of the shell , so that the pulse timescale in the observer frame is @xmath17 @xcite . here",
    ", we choose parameters , @xmath18 , @xmath19 s , which implies @xmath20 cm .",
    "the energy density of accelerated electrons in the shell @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the total energy density of the shocked plasma ) is a parameter that can be directly related to the isotropic - equivalent energy of photons from a single pulse @xmath23 ( here we adopt @xmath24 erg ) as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the comoving volume .    in the standard scenario ,",
    "relativistic electrons are injected at the shock front with a power - law energy distribution @xmath27 for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the electron lorentz factor in the plasma rest frame .",
    "this scenario requires a sharp low - energy cutoff for the electron injection spectrum ; the minimum lorentz factor @xmath30 is evaluated in the literature by giving the energy density of electrons @xmath21 together with the total number density of electrons .",
    "therefore , in the standard scenario , @xmath30 has been conventionally described by the phenomenological parameter @xmath31 , though the energy scale corresponding to @xmath30 should be derived from physics in relativistic plasmas . here , instead of @xmath31",
    ", we take @xmath30 to be a parameter , because we do not concern the non - observable parameter @xmath22 .    the photon energy @xmath6 corresponding to @xmath30",
    "is given by @xmath32 the cooling timescale for electrons of @xmath30 is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the thomson cross section . with a non - dimensional parameter @xmath35 , the magnetic energy density @xmath36 is given as @xmath37 . in figure",
    "[ fig : test ] , we set @xmath38 3200 g and @xmath39 , which correspond to @xmath40 and @xmath41 a few hundred kev , respectively .",
    "we numerically follow electron cooling via synchrotron and ic emissions , adopting the klein - nishina cross section , and artificially stop the calculation after @xmath8 to mimic the decay of magnetic fields .",
    "the effects of @xmath42 pair production and synchrotron self - absorption are also taken into account . since @xmath43 in our choice",
    ", the klein - nishina effect can not be neglected for ic emission .",
    "the dynamical timescale @xmath44 s is much longer than the cooling time @xmath45 s.    the blue curve with @xmath46 corresponds to the slow cooling case @xcite . in this case , @xmath6 is determined by the lowest energy of electrons that can cool within the timescale @xmath8 .",
    "as is well known , the index in the slow cooling case is @xmath47 , which is softer than the typical observed @xmath10 for our choice of @xmath48 .",
    "if we adopt a very hard injection index @xmath49 , @xmath10 can be @xmath50 , but the high - energy index @xmath51 contradicts the typical value @xmath52 .",
    "on the other hand , for the two cases , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( green and black curves ) , the index becomes @xmath55 below @xmath6 .",
    "these cases are what @xcite suggested to solve the problem of the low - energy spectral index .",
    "it is further seen in figure [ fig : test ] that for the case of @xmath56 ( red curve ) the spectrum shows @xmath57 .",
    "this is the prediction by the standard model as referred in the introduction : electrons injected with @xmath58 are cooled after @xmath59 , and the low - energy spectrum becomes soft owing to emissions from such cooled electrons .",
    "it is noted that this case shows a spectral bump in the gev band due to ic emission , whose contribution is boosted up by enhancement of low - energy seed photons .",
    "we can also see cutoffs above 10 gev and below 30 ev .",
    "they are @xmath42-absorption and synchrotron self - absorption , respectively .",
    "the above results indicate that only with the case , @xmath60 , the decaying magnetic field can explain the low - energy index @xmath10 . however , there is no definite physical reason to expect such a matching between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the jitter radiation @xcite instead of the synchrotron radiation is worthwhile to consider , because the typical scale of turbulence excited by plasma instabilities can be much shorter than the larmor radii of radiating electrons .",
    "while the typical photon energy in the jitter radiation , which is determined by the coherence scale of the disturbed magnetic field , differs from in the usual synchrotron radiation , the introduction of the jitter radiation does not significantly change the low - energy spectral shape : @xmath10 remains @xmath63 as long as @xmath64 ( fast cooling ) .",
    "as we mentioned in  [ sec : dec ] , turbulent magnetic fields may be generated in the plasmas around shocks .",
    "such turbulent waves may play a role in energy transfer from protons to electrons until the magnetic fields decay . in this section",
    "we present our new model , the slow heating model , to resolve the index problem .",
    "while the standard picture postulates a prompt acceleration of electrons , whose timescale is much shorter than @xmath65 , our model assumes slower energy transfer from the background plasma to electrons via some unknown plasma instabilities ( see figure [ fig : sch ] ) .    in order to mimic the energy transfer we consider the second - order fermi acceleration , even though there may exist not only alfvn waves but also other types of acceleration mechanisms such as electric fields around ion current channels @xcite or coherent wave - particle interactions resulting from parametric instabilities @xcite , which can also contribute to particle acceleration .",
    "when a particle is scattered by a wave or magnetized cloud preserving its energy in the wave ( cloud ) frame , twice lorentz transformations give us energy gain due to this collision @xmath66 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the lorentz factor of the wave ( cloud ) , cosines of incident angle in the reference frame , and scattering angle in the wave ( cloud ) frame , respectively . if the wave velocity is non - relativistic ( @xmath71 ) , the mean energy gain @xmath72 under the assumption of isotropic wave distribution @xmath73 and isotropic scattering @xmath74 .",
    "so the second - order fermi acceleration is a slower acceleration process than the first - order one ( @xmath75 ) in non - relativistic cases .",
    "however , grb internal shock is relativistic so that we can expect turbulent magnetic fields with @xmath76 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for ultrarelativistic particles can be written as @xmath77 , \\label{fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the energy diffusion coefficient ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . defining the mean free time of particles @xmath79 , we can write @xmath80 and the acceleration timescale @xmath81 . at present",
    "we have no reliable model of relativistic turbulence in grbs . for reference ,",
    "let us look in stochastic acceleration in non - relativistic plasma .",

    "* ) . the model with @xmath86 is often adopted for small scale mhd turbulences ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another value @xmath87 is frequently used for the kolmogorov turbulence . the strong turbulence limit ( bohm limit ) , where the mean free path becomes comparable to larmor radii , corresponds to the case of @xmath88 , where the dependence on @xmath89 disappears .",
    "relativistic shocks in electron - positron plasmas in pic simulations @xcite generate magnetic turbulence with @xmath90 for small @xmath91 ( @xmath92 plasma frequency ) , but @xmath93 for large @xmath91 . although we have no definite shape of @xmath78 for grbs yet , future long - term pic simulations may reveal the property and evolution of magnetic turbulence .    from eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) we may write @xmath94 , so that we assume the probability function of @xmath95 per collision as a gaussian form , @xmath96 } , \\quad \\sigma=\\sqrt{\\overline{\\xi}-\\overline{\\xi}^2}. \\label{prob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hereafter , we assume a constant value of @xmath97 .",
    "considering synchrotron and ic emissions , the energy loss rate due to radiative cooling is expressed as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the photon energy density and the correction coefficient due to the klein - nishina effect , respectively . in the thomson limit , @xmath101 .",
    "we employ the monte carlo numerical code of @xcite to follow the radiative cooling and stochastic energy gain / loss processes according to eqs .",
    "( [ cool ] ) and ( [ prob ] ) with a time step , @xmath102 and at @xmath103 , we artificially halt the calculations to mimic the decay of magnetic fields . for each time step , we judge the occurrence of collision and estimate energy loss due to radiation using random numbers .",
    "if a collision occurs , the energy gain / loss due to the collision is counted with evaluated @xmath95 .",
    "since highly disturbed magnetic fields are assumed , it is meaningful to consider the jitter radiation @xcite .",

    "we numerically estimate the spectral photon emission rate and @xmath100 by integrating the photon energy distribution given in advance with the klein - nishina cross section @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "we assume a uniform and isotropic photon field within a shell with width @xmath16 in the shell frame . to obtain photon spectra",
    ", the energy distributions of photons and particles are simulated iteratively until the resultant spectrum and presupposed spectrum are identical .",
    "in addition we take into account @xmath42 pair production and synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "however , these processes are not so important in this paper , so that we omit the explanation of the method to include these effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the studies for plasma turbulences in the post shock region by many authors are ongoing now .",
    "although remarkable development is seen in recent pic simulations and mhd simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a definite picture of shocked plasma is not understood yet . here , we consider a simple toy model assuming that @xmath105 , which means that @xmath79 does not depend on the energy of electrons .",

    ", we adopt a stronger magnetic field @xmath106 g. the other parameters are the same as those in  [ sec : model ] except for the electron injection .",
    "the typical photon energy is expected to be emitted from electrons , whose energy loss rate is balanced with the second - order fermi acceleration .",
    "therefore , we adjust @xmath79 to make @xmath107 at @xmath108 ( @xmath109 s ) that implies the typical photon energy @xmath110 a few hundred kev .",

    "@xmath113 the acceleration timescale is shorter ( longer ) than the synchrotron cooling timescale .",
    "the heating due to turbulence reduces the effective number of electrons below @xmath113 so that the low - energy photon spectrum is expected to be harder than the standard one ( the red line in figure [ fig : test ] ) even for @xmath114 . at @xmath115 electrons",

    "the result is shown in figure [ fig:2nd ] .",
    "photons at the spectral peak are emitted from electrons of @xmath119 as anticipated in advance .",
    "since electrons are accelerated immediately , the injection parameter @xmath120 does not affect the resultant spectrum very much .",

    "compared to figure [ fig : test ] , the lower density of target photons ( @xmath124 mev ) weakens the @xmath42 absorption effect on ic emission .",

    "we magnify the spectrum for 10 kev1 mev range in figure [ fig:2nd](b ) . in this energy range",

    "* ) , the usual simple power - law injection for electrons can easily reproduce the mev - gev power - law spectra . in the slow heating model ,",
    "one of the simplest interpretation to overcome this difficulty is that such power - law spectra are superpositions of multiple components with different @xmath6 .",
    "this explanation requires fine adjust of the amplitude of multiple components .",
    "although this interpretation remains viable so far , we search for alternative ideas within the slow heating model in this section .    in  [ sec : simple ]",
    ", the index @xmath126 of energy dependence of @xmath127 was taken 2 . to make the resultant energy spectrum harder , we first test the cases with @xmath128 ( note that @xmath129 for @xmath130 in higher energy range ) .",
    "our simulations show that the spectral shape becomes close to a power - law function as @xmath126 increases",
    ". however , even for an extreme choice of @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) , the resultant index @xmath133 is still not hard enough .    since we consider the decay of the magnetic fields , it is natural to let @xmath134 also time ( or equivalently distance from the shock front ) dependent .",
    "our toy model assumes a power - law shape as @xmath135 with upper and lower limits .",
    "namely , @xmath136,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 in our model . in this case , the initial short timescale of acceleration makes @xmath6 higher , and as the acceleration timescale elongates with time , @xmath6 will be settled around a few hundred kev . here , to harden spectra",
    ", we adopt @xmath138 .",
    "since the acceleration time from @xmath120 to @xmath139 is @xmath140 , the highest photon energy may be @xmath141 mev emitted from electrons of @xmath142 ( 10 gev photons from electrons of @xmath143 may not be produced so much ) .",
    "assuming @xmath144 ( other parameters are the same as before ) , we calculate spectra ( see figure [ fig : tdep ] ) .",
    "we can see that the spectra above @xmath6 for @xmath145 and @xmath146 are well approximated by power - law functions . even for @xmath147 ,",
    "the spectrum from @xmath148 kev to @xmath149 mev can be accepted as a power - law function .",
    "the peak energy @xmath6 for @xmath145 becomes above mev , because @xmath150 at @xmath103 is still shorter than the final acceleration timescale assumed in advance , @xmath151 . for @xmath147 , after @xmath152 , the timescale @xmath79 attains the upper limit @xmath151 , which makes @xmath119 .",
    "compared to the timescale of stay around @xmath120 , the longer stayover around @xmath113 yields the spectrum bump around a few hundred kev as set in advance .",

    "the models of @xmath78 in this section are toy models to demonstrate the capability of mev - gev power - law spectrum in the slow heating model .",
    "in addition , we have assumed the monochromatic injection of electrons .",
    "the actual plasma turbulence and electron injection mechanism may be more complicated than the models we tested .",
    "the strength of magnetic fields may evolve with @xmath153 , or the first - order fermi acceleration or surfing / drift / wake - field acceleration ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may work as the injection mechanism at shock front .",
    "although we need the nontrivial shape of @xmath78 to reproduce the high - energy power - law spectra , the actual grb plasmas may provide favorable conditions for mev - gev emissions .",
    "pic simulations can be strong tools to verify this scenario .",
    "for example , @xcite show that the energy density of magnetic turbulence in electron - positron plasma evolves as @xmath154 initially , then steepens to @xmath155 later .",
    "such results encourage the model we discussed in this section .",
    "in the simulations discussed in the previous sections , we have artificially halted the calculations at @xmath103 with constant magnetic fields . however , the actual magnetic fields may not disappear suddenly , and we may expect residual magnetic fields at @xmath156 . in this section ,",
    "we consider emissions after the decay of magnetic fields . here",
    ", we assume a simple exponential decay and residual magnetic fields as @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are constants . as for the acceleration timescale ,",
    "to get rid of the heating effect smoothly , we assume the rapid evolution of @xmath79 as @xmath160 we numerically follow electron cooling / heating and photon emission during a period of @xmath161 with @xmath162 and @xmath118 ( see figure [ fig : gdel ] ) .",
    "two parameter sets are adopted ; one is the same as that in  [ sec : simple ] ( @xmath18 , @xmath163 , @xmath20 cm , @xmath164 g ) , and another parameter set describes a higher @xmath14 case with the same @xmath6 and @xmath165 : @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 cm , and @xmath169 g. for the final magnetic fields , @xmath170 g is adopted in both the two cases , though there is no clue to the residual magnetic fields at present . for @xmath171 , the photon emission mechanism is the same as those in  [ sec : simple ] .",
    "however , after @xmath103 , the main cooling mechanism is switched from synchrotron to ic , because the photon density is assumed to be constant within the shell of width @xmath172 .    comparing the thin dotted line with solid lines in figure [ fig : gdel ] , it is clearly shown that the residual energy of electrons at @xmath103 is emitted via ic emission in gev - tev ranges .",
    "the typical photon energy due to ic largely depends on @xmath14 . as shown by the long dashed line in figure [ fig : gdel ]",
    ", @xmath42 absorption affects the final spectrum for @xmath18 above 10 gev ( close to the cases of figure [ fig : test ] ) , while it is negligible for @xmath166 owing to the lower photon density .",
    "therefore , this case indicates a delayed onset of gev - tev photons compared to mev photons with a timescale of @xmath173 . on the other hand , the spectral shape in the low - energy region",
    "is not altered in this model as seen in figure [ fig : gdel ] .",
    "recent grbs detected by _",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is noted that the broadband spectral shape for grb 080916c is not well reproduced by our simple toy model .",
    "future observations with _ fermi _ or cerenkov telescopes will testify the model prospects and yield a clue to the refinement of the model .",
    "next , let us consider photon emission in longer timescales than the dynamical timescale @xmath175 . in the standard scenario ,",
    "emission after the dynamical timescale may be negligible because of the fast cooling of electrons .",
    "however , in our scenario , the residual electron energy may be released via synchrotron radiation , which can contribute to optical emissions as seen in some grbs @xcite .",
    "our results for such cases are shown in figure [ fig : odel ] , where the parameters are the same as those for @xmath18 in figure [ fig : gdel ] , but @xmath176 , @xmath170 , 10 and 30 g , and rapid decay of the photon density @xmath177}$ ] .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect the effects of adiabatic cooling due to shell expansion .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : odel ] , optical synchrotron emissions become more luminous than the fluence of the power - law extrapolation from the x - ray spectra .",
    "most of the optical photons are emitted after @xmath178 in the weak magnetic fields so that broader pulse profile is expected for optical than @xmath179/x - ray bands .",
    "such longer variability timescales in prompt optical emission is seen in grb 080319b @xcite , though the flux is brighter than the extrapolation from the x - ray spectra by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude ( 1 - 2 orders in our results ) .",
    "more luminous optical emissions as compared to x - ray may be possible , if we change @xmath8 .",
    "since our objective in this paper is not to reproduce spectra of specific grbs , we do not further discuss the fraction of optical flux here .",
    "motivated by the energy transfer and low - energy spectrum problems , we propose a new model to reproduce grb prompt emissions . in this model",
    ", electrons are continuously heated via plasma turbulences within a timescale longer than the cooling timescale .",
    "the acceleration timescale is assumed to be much longer than that in the standard picture .",
    "emissions from cooled electrons are suppressed so that the low - energy spectral index @xmath10 is close to the observed value @xmath180 . at least below mev , the model spectrum does not contradict the band function very much . considering that most of the grb spectra were obtained in energy ranges below mev , the model spectra may be consistent with a large fraction of grbs . in order to explain power - law spectra in mev - gev range observed in some grbs , we need a superposition of multiple components with different @xmath6 , or nontrivial shape and evolution of the diffusion coefficient . our model , under certain conditions , predicts delayed gev - tev emission via ic or delayed optical emission with broad pulse profile via synchrotron .",
    "we expect that the accumulation of many grb observations will verify the characteristics predicted by our model in near future .    roughly speaking ,",
    "the energy release in this model is estimated as @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the total number of accelerated electrons .",
    "given the total isotropic energy @xmath183 , the required number of electrons depends on @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the fraction of accelerated electrons can be much less than unity in this model , while many authors have frequently assumed that all electrons are accelerated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "one interesting point in our model is that the physical explanation for the spectral peak energy @xmath6 is clear .",
    "the balance between synchrotron cooling and heating provides us the typical electron energy @xmath184 , from which we can estimate @xmath6 .",
    "the spectral peak and low - energy index are reproduced by this mechanism unless @xmath185 .",
    "one remaining problem is why shocked plasma in grbs always adjust @xmath79 to make @xmath6 observed range of @xmath0 mev . to explain this we need another assumption ; for example , @xmath186 , which implies @xmath187 .",
    "the balance between cooling time @xmath188 and @xmath150 gives us @xmath189 .",
    "since we may write the luminosity as @xmath190 , we obtain @xmath191 where @xmath14-dependence disappears .",
    "these results are consistent with the yonetoku relation ( @xmath192 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except for the factor @xmath193 . of course , the above assumption is not trivial .",
    "when we assume @xmath194 , the correlation becomes @xmath195 .",
    "if the jitter radiation is applicable , in which the typical photon energy depends on the coherent scale of the field , the yonetoku relation implies some correlations between the typical scale of turbulence and luminosity . in any case , fundamental studies of the long - term evolution of relativistic plasmas , based on pic simulations , etc .",
    ", are indispensable to verify the model and luminosity correlations .    for the _ fermi_-lat grb 080916c , by a process of elimination , @xcite conclude that this grb is emitted from a magnetically dominated outflow . in such a case , the dissipation of the bulk kinetic energy may not be due to internal shocks , because the alfvn velocity is very close to the light speed . in order to produce non - thermal particles , the dissipation of magnetic fields such as magnetic reconnection , etc .",
    "should occur in the outflow .",
    "the dissipation processes of magnetic fields may generate magnetic turbulences so that we can expect the second - order fermi acceleration in this case too .",
