    "recently , the cleo collaboration @xcite has measured the @xmath7 form factor @xmath8 with high precision .",
    "this data has been processed by schmedding and yakovlev ( sy ) @xcite using light - cone qcd sum rules ( lcsr ) , taking also into account the perturbative qcd contributions in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) approximation . in this way sy obtained useful constraints on the shape of the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) in terms of confidence regions for the gegenbauer coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the latter being the projection coefficients of the pion da on the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "note that sy have extended to the nlo the lcsr approach suggested before by khodjamirian @xcite for the leading order ( lo ) light - cone sum rule method .",
    "the present analysis gives further support to the claim , expressed by the above mentioned authors , that lcsrs provide the most appropriate basis in describing the form factor of the @xmath11 transition .",
    "this is intimately connected with peculiarities of real - photon processes in qcd @xcite .",
    "but the method of the cleo data processing , adopted in  @xcite , seems to be not quite complete from our point of view .",
    "we think that an optimal analysis should take into account the correct erbl evolution of the pion da to the scale @xmath12 of the process ( the latter not to be fixed at some average point , @xmath13  gev , as done in @xcite ) and to re - estimate the contribution @xmath4 from the next twist term .",
    "the influence of both these effects appears to be important and it is examined here in detail .",
    "furthermore , we are not satisfied with the error estimation performed in the sy analysis , for reasons to be explained later , and prefer therefore to use a more traditional treatment to determine the sensitivity to the input parameter @xmath4 and the construction of the 1-@xmath14 and 2-@xmath14 error contours",
    ".    our main goal in the present work will be to obtain new constraints on the @xmath15 da parameters from the cleo data , taking into account all the remarks mentioned above , and then to compare them with the constraints following from qcd srs with nonlocal condensates ( nlc ) .",
    "we will not repeat here the derivation of the main results of lcsrs , as well as those related to nlc srs , but we will refer the interested reader to @xcite and correspondingly to @xcite and references therein .",
