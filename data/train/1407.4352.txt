    "in the past decades much effort has been devoted to define effective hamiltonians  @xcite for many - particle systems such as , e.g. , systems of water clusters  @xcite , dissolved ions  @xcite , polymers  @xcite , phospholipids  @xcite and ( bio-)molecules like protein - dna complexes  @xcite .",
    "typically , these effective hamiltonians are restricted to pair terms , where the effective pair potentials are either suggested heuristically  @xcite or derived by a systematic coarse - graining procedure , implying that `` irrelevant '' degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "one main motivation behind the construction of such effective potentials is to enable computer simulations on length and time scales larger than those accessible for the underlying original system .",
    "this is achieved , on the one hand , by considering fewer degrees of freedom , and on the other one hand , by the enhanced softness of effective interactions @xcite , which allows for larger time steps .    in most studies",
    "so far , the effective potentials are purely distance - dependent , where the distance considered is typically that between center of masses @xcite .",
    "interactions between _ non - spherical _ molecules are then described , e.g. , by representing the molecule as interconnected spherical beads  @xcite , an approach which seems particularly suitable for large , flexible molecules such as polymers .    in the present study",
    ", we consider effective interactions between anisotropic molecules which have , however , a well - defined shape and are characterized by uniaxial symmetry . for such systems we present a coarse - graining approach yielding effective pair potentials depending on both , distance and angular variables .",
    "our overall aim is not only to provide a recipe to calculate such a potential , but also to evaluate the importance of angular resolution of the potential relative to a simplified center of mass description .",
    "we also aim to explore the dependence of the angle - resolved potential on temperature .    as a candidate system",
    "we consider a pair of two disk - like molecules such as coronene .",
    "a sketch of the system is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : twocoros ] .    an exemplary configuration of two coronene molecules illustrating their internal atomic structure .",
    "green and gray spheres refer to carbon and hydrogen atoms , respectively .",
    "the arrows stand for coarse - grained ( vectorial ) variables introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : reaction coordinates ] . ]",
    "coronene is a conjugated organic molecule with a disk - like shape , for which the assumption of uniaxiality is well justified @xcite .",
    "moreover , coronene molecules have already been discussed as possible candidates for active layer compounds in photovoltaic applications  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in organic solar cells , diskotic organic molecules such as triphenylenes , hexabenzocoronenes and their derivatives are quite common @xcite .",
    "a prerequisite for advancing the functionality of organic solar cells is to understand the many - particle structures of the molecules involved .",
    "for example , for disk - like molecules such as coronene one expects the formation of columnar structures @xcite , indicating that any coarse - grained description of such systems _ must _ take into account the molecule s anisotropic shape .",
    "the question is then which additional microscopic effects ( beyond the anisotropic shape ) need to be taken into account and how this should be done .",
    "indeed , on an atomistic level , coronene - coronene interactions are characterized by attractive van - der - waals interactions , intramolecular flexibility as well as coulombic interactions stemming from the partial charges .",
    "various coarse - grained models for coronene already exist ; however , none of these includes all presumably important features .",
    "for example , von lilienfeld and andrienko  @xcite have suggested a coronene pair potential which is based on quantum chemical calculations .",
    "however , this potential takes into account the face - to - face configuration alone .",
    "thus , the potential does not take into account the full configurational space .",
    "babadi et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a pair potential which corresponds to fit according to an ellipsoidal soft potential suggested in ref .  .",
    "this potential is indeed angle - dependent but does not depend on temperature and , thus , neglects entropic effects . in yet another study ,",
    "obolensky et al  @xcite proposed a uniaxial model , where each coronene molecule is represented as a collection of charged rings .",
    "thus , the model takes into account the electrostatic contributions to the effective potential .",
    "one drawback , however , is that the evaluation of the resulting potential is numerically quite involved and therefore inconvenient for many - particle simulations .",
    "indeed , the calculations in ref .   rather focus on dimer configurations .",
    "moreover , this specific model does not include the impact of temperature .",
    "the above examples show that finding the `` right '' coarse - grained coronene - coronene interactions is not straightforward . in the present study",
    ", we simplify the task and concentrate on deriving effective potentials stemming from non - electrostatic interactions alone .",
    "this restriction implies that we can not describe the realistic crystal configuration of coronene , which corresponds to a herringbone structure @xcite .",
    "we note that a correct description of the electrostatics would include not only dealing with long - range coulombic potentials , but also treating polarization effects , that is , differences in the molecular charge distributions within dilute systems ( i.e. , isolated molecules ) , on the one hand , and dense systems , on the other hand @xcite . here",
    "we avoid this task and focus on the remaining challenges , that is , the description of angle dependency and temperature dependency due to the non - electrostatic interactions . our goal is to provide a versatile `` recipe '' which may be applied to a class of anisotropic , uniaxial molecules .",
    "the coronene molecule is used as an _ example _ for establishing our approach .    from a methodological point of view , we employ the `` classical '' statistical - mechanical route first suggested by kirkwood  @xcite , who introduced the potential of mean force ( pmf ) .",
    "the pmf is defined as the difference of the free energy profiles between two molecular configurations .",
    "these free energy profiles can be calculated by performing a boltzmann inversion of the corresponding probability distribution functions gained in corresponding atomistic simulations . for a system composed of only two molecules the free energy profiles",
    "then lead directly to effective pair potentials , which include entropic contributions .",
    "therefore , the resulting potential depends on the temperature .",
    "other routes suggested in the literature are based on force - matching ( see , e.g. , ref .   for charged particles in solvent ) , a method which can be extended towards internal degrees of freedom @xcite and to multiscale systems @xcite .",
    "further , fundamentally different approaches are the reverse monte carlo  @xcite technique , the iterative boltzmann inversion scheme  @xcite or integral equation schemes  @xcite based on structural properties .",
    "the present study corresponds to a generalization of the original kirkwood route towards a two - particle system with spatial and angular degrees of freedom .    as a method to generate the underlying probability distribution functions we use all - atom langevin dynamics ,",
    "i.e. , molecular dynamics coupled to a heat bath . to overcome sampling problems we use and compare two different methods , each having its own advantages .",
    "the first one is the umbrella sampling method @xcite involving static bias potentials , combined with the weighted histogram analysis method ( wham ) @xcite .",
    "the second method is referred to as steered dynamics @xcite , which is inspired from experiments where large molecules are stretched and then the rupture force is measured @xcite .",
    "this method has already been used , e.g. , in ligand - receptor simulations  @xcite .    for both sampling methods ,",
    "we parametrize the resulting potential curves in terms of a modified gay - berne potential .",
    "this step facilitates simulations of large ensembles at different packing fractions and temperatures . by comparing the resulting thermodynamic quantities and",
    "phase behavior with that of the underlying all - atom system , we can evaluate the quality of the coarse - grained potentials .",
    "we find that the angle - dependence of the potential is important not only in dense , liquid - crystalline states , but already at intermediate densities .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : effective interaction of coronene molecules ] is devoted to our methods , including the definition of coarse - grained variables ( sec .",
    "[ sec : reaction coordinates ] ) , the definition of the effective pair potential via partition sums ( sec .",

    "[ sec : parametrization in terms of a gay - berne potential ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : many particle simulations ] we discuss the results from many - particle simulations based on the effective potentials and all - atom simulations , focusing on the phase behavior of the system .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the system of interest consists of two atomistically detailed coronene molecules ( @xmath0 ) in a large cubic box @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath2 is the boxlength ) .",
    "each coronene molecule contains @xmath3 atoms .",
    "every atom @xmath4 in our model system is represented by a point mass @xmath5 at the position @xmath6 .",
    "the interactions between all atoms are described by lennard - jones ( lj ) potentials for non - bonded interactions and harmonic potentials for the intramolecular bond- , angular- and dihedral - interactions . for the present study all coulomb interactions",
    "are set to zero .",
    "the potential energy as a function of all @xmath7 atomic coordinates can then be written as @xmath8\\nonumber\\\\   &   & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i , j } k_{ij}^{b}\\left(r_{ij}-r_{\\mathrm{\\text{eq}}}\\right)^{2}\\\\   &   & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i , j , k } k_{ijk}^{\\theta}\\left(\\theta_{ijk}-\\theta_{\\mathrm{\\text{eq}}}\\right)^{2}\\nonumber\\\\   &   & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i , j , k , l } k_{ijkl}^{\\phi}\\left[1+\\cos\\left(n\\phi_{ijkl}-\\epsilon \\right)\\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the lj parameters between atoms @xmath4 and @xmath11 .",
    "atomic distances are denoted with @xmath12 .",
    "further , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are force constants for the intramolecular bond- and angular- interactions , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the corresponding equilibrium bond lengths and bond angles , respectively . the quantity @xmath17 is a dihedral parameter and @xmath18 is the corresponding dihedral angle , while @xmath19 serves as a phase angle which is either @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "the factor @xmath22 appearing in the last term stands for the proper - dihedral multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "all parameter values are taken from the generalized amber force field , designed for organic molecules  @xcite .",
    "the positions of the atoms evolve in time according to all - atom langevin dynamics , that is , @xmath23 in eq .  , @xmath24 is a vector whose components @xmath25 are gaussian random numbers with @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the friction constant is denoted with @xmath28 which is set to @xmath29 , and the two non - conservative forces are coupled via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in the actual numerical simulations the equations of motion [ see eq .  ] are supplemented by constraints or bias potentials as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sampling methods ] .",
    "the resulting set of equations is solved with the gromacs  @xcite simulation package , using version 4.5.4 for the steered dynamics and version 4.5.5  @xcite for the umbrella sampling .",
    "the cutoff - lengths for the atomic lj interactions are set to @xmath30 .",
    "the simulations last for @xmath31 with an integration time step of @xmath32 . to calculate histograms trajectories are extracted every @xmath33 .",
    "an important step in any coarse - graining procedure is to define variables that represent the coarse - grained , mesoscopic system .",
    "here we describe each coronene molecule by the center of mass position @xmath34 and an orientation vector @xmath35 , pointing along the axis related to the largest eigenvalue of the atomistic tensor of moments of inertia .",
    "a configuration of the coronene `` dimer '' consisting of the two individual molecules a and b is therefore defined by the four three - dimensional vectors @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : twocoros ] ) .",
    "this choice of coarse - grained variables seems most natural due to several reasons : first , the inertia tensor is symmetric implying that the resulting coarse - grained variables do not change under simultaneous change of the atomistic masses .",
    "second , the chosen set of variables is compatible with the variables used in the gay - berne model , which we will later use to parametrize our coarse - grained potential ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : parametrization in terms of a gay - berne potential ] ) .",
    "third , the center - of - mass description provides a particularly comfortable route to calculate the virial pressure .",
    "the number of variables describing the coronene `` dimer '' can be further reduced by transforming to the body - fixed frame and using the head - tail symmetry of the particles .",
    "moreover , we require the effective interaction of the two molecules to have chiral symmetry ( i.e. , it should be invariant against mirroring the dimer system ) .",
    "this finally leads to a set of four reaction coordinates : @xmath40 the coordinate @xmath41 stands for the molecular distance , while @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 represent angular configurations of the dimer . in the last line of eq .",
    ", `` @xmath45 '' is the sign function defined as @xmath46 for @xmath47 ; @xmath48 for @xmath49 ; and @xmath50 . for further investigation",
    "we also introduce the corresponding functions that map the atomic description directly on the coarse - grained description .",
    "they are denoted with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .      in this section",
    "we derive an effective pair potential , which depends on the reaction coordinates defined in eq .  .",
    "the coronene dimer , which consists of @xmath55 atoms ( with the atoms @xmath56 ,  , @xmath57 belonging to molecule a and the rest belonging to molecule b ) , leads to the following canonical configuration integral @xmath58 where @xmath59 has the dimension of length .",
    "each atomic configuration @xmath60 corresponds to a unique set of reaction coordinates , i.e. + @xmath61 ,  , @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the canonical configuration integral can be written as an integration over the reaction coordinates @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , yielding @xmath63 in eq .",
    "the appearance of @xmath64 indicates the constrained integration over the subclass of microstates , which corresponds to the reaction coordinates @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we next introduce the configuration integral for a fixed mesoscopic configuration @xmath65 combining eqs .",
    "and   we find @xmath66 at this point , it seems plausible to define an effective interaction potential ( or rather , a distance dependent free energy profile ) simply by taking the logarithm of @xmath67 .",
    "however , closer inspection of the definition   reveals that @xmath67 still depends on the values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 even if the distances considered are much larger than the range of the all - atom potential @xmath68 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "this is clearly unphysical .",
    "the reason for the problem is that different values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 imply different numbers of sampled microstates .",
    "we therefore introduce a new effective configuration integral @xmath69 , which is normalized by the amount of configuration space volume , that is , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a `` microcanonical '' integral , which counts the number of microstates belonging to a fixed set of coarse - grained variables @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "specifically , @xmath72 this expression can be further simplified ( see appendix  [ sec : configurational entropy for ( r , a , b , c ) ] ) .",
    "the resulting effective configuration integral is independent of its variables at large distances , that is , @xmath73 based on @xmath74 , we now define an effective potential via @xmath75\\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eqs .   and",
    ", it follows that @xmath76 for @xmath77 , as one would expect .",
    "we determine the quantity @xmath67 entering @xmath74 [ see eq .  ] by solving eq .   through numerical sampling methods",
    "as described in section  [ sec : sampling methods ] .",
    "the denominator in eq .  ,",
    "@xmath78 , can be associated to a boltzmann entropy @xmath79\\text{. } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taken altogether , we can thus interpret @xmath80 as a configuration - dependent free energy , corrected by the boltzmann entropy related to the configuration space spanned by the coarse - grained variables .",
    "if the distance @xmath41 is the only variable on the mesoscopic level , the entropy reduces to @xmath81 , as outlined in ref .  .",
    "to calculate the effective potential [ see eq .",
    "] from the trajectories of the atomic system we introduce the histogram function , @xmath82 where the brackets @xmath83 in the second line denote an ensemble average in the atomic system and we have used the definitions eqs .   and  .",
    "with eq .  , the effective pair potential can be written as @xmath84 \\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to perform the configurational sampling , i.e. to actually calculate the function @xmath85 , we perform all - atom langevin dynamics simulations as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : atomic system ] .",
    "the noise term in the corresponding equations of motion [ see eq .  ] generates internal translational and rotational motion , i.e. , translational motion of individual atoms and rotations of the entire molecule around the molecules center of mass .",
    "however , standard sampling is hampered by the fact that the two molecules strongly attract each other . in the next paragraphs",
    "we describe two methods to overcome this drawback by restraining or constraining the molecules to a certain distance @xmath41 , while the orientational motion is undisturbed .      in the framework of umbrella sampling  @xcite ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is supplemented by a bias potential to support the sampling in different regions of configuration space .",
    "together with the weighted histogram analysis method  @xcite ( wham ) umbrella sampling was already used to construct purely distance - dependent effective molecular pair potentials , e.g. for methane in aqueous solution  @xcite . in this article",
    "we use bias potentials that correspond to harmonic springs .",
    "specifically , @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "each of the @xmath88 springs acts on the molecular centers of mass and is used for one specific simulation , called umbrella window run . the equilibrium length for each spring , @xmath89 , and the spring constants , @xmath90 ,",
    "are chosen to guarantee a strong overlap of the @xmath41-dependent biased histogram functions @xmath91 for neighboring umbrella windows ( k , k+1 ) .",
    "the brackets @xmath92 denote an ensemble or time average in the umbrella window @xmath93 . out of @xmath94",
    ", we can obtain purely distance - dependent , unbiased histograms @xmath95 by using the one - dimensional wham equations given in appendix  [ sec : the wham equations ] . in principle , it is possible to extend these equations to the multidimensional case  @xcite involving additional reaction coordinates @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 . in our case",
    "the bias potential is a function of @xmath41 alone [ see eq .  ] while we are interested in the four - dimensional histogram @xmath96 .",
    "therefore we employ eqs .   and   together with the following decomposition of the full unbiased histogram function @xmath97 where the @xmath98 represent @xmath41-dependent coefficients defined in eq .",
    "a similar strategy has been recently used in ref .   where the goal was to obtain the effective pair potential of a methanol pair dissolved in water with two reaction coordinates .",
    "in a steered dynamics simulation  @xcite a reaction coordinate is changed in time by applying external constraining forces . here",
    "we pull one molecule away from the other one along the connecting vector @xmath34 .",
    "specifically , the molecular distance is steered according to the following law @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the pull rate .",
    "the latter is so small , that the entire simulation can be seen as a quasi - static process .",
    "therefore , given a small time interval , the system evolves according to the so - called constrained - reaction - coordinate - dynamics ensemble  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile all rotational degrees of freedom remain unconstrained .",
    "the scheme in eq .   implies an equal weighting of all values of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the corresponding @xmath41-dependent histogram function @xmath101 forms a flat distribution .",
    "that means that @xmath101 does not provide any information about the distance - dependent effective potential . hence @xmath96 is not measureable in that way . in order to overcome this drawback we factorize the unconstrained histogram function , as follows @xmath102 in eq .",
    "the distribution @xmath101 can be calculated via the free energy @xmath103 .",
    "specifically , one has @xmath104 where @xmath105 can be determined through a thermodynamic integration  @xcite .    to calculate the remaining function @xmath96 we use eq .  ,",
    "yielding @xmath106    the right hand side can be considered as an ensemble average over all atomic configurations , that correspond to the specific center of mass distance @xmath41 .",
    "specifically , @xmath107 we can conclude that @xmath108 is the conditional histogram function of the angle dependent reaction coordinates for a fixed distance @xmath41 . for small time intervals @xmath109 ( small enough to ensure that @xmath41 is fixed , but large enough to sample the entire angular configuration space ) we can replace the ensemble average in eq .   by a time average , that is @xmath110 the smaller the pull rate @xmath100",
    ", the larger @xmath109 can be . finally , by combining eqs .  ,   and   we obtain the unconstrained function @xmath96 .      in order to determine the histogram functions @xmath111 and @xmath112 for umbrella sampling or @xmath108 for steered dynamics , respectively , we use the following scheme . for both sampling methods",
    "the molecular distance @xmath41 , is sub - divided into @xmath113 bins covering the interval @xmath114}$ ] . to capture the angle dependence ,",
    "we focus on eight configurations , namely the face - face , parallel weakly displaced , parallel displaced , t , herringbone , v , edge - edge and the cross configuration .",
    "graphical representations as well as explicit definitions in terms of the reaction coordinates @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given in table  [ tab : tolerances ] in appendix  [ sec : dimer configurations ] . in order to assign a set of coordinates ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) to one of these configurations",
    ", we use the tolerances given in this table . to obtain a smooth result for the effective interactions @xmath115 for the previously introduced configurations , we reduce the number of bins in the angle - resolved unbiased histogram function @xmath96 that determines @xmath115 [ see eq .  ] to @xmath116 .",
    "this is realized by associating bin @xmath117 to bin @xmath118}$ ] , yielding @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 . as a consequence",
    "the first bins are small , while bins for larger distances are bigger to account for the weaker sampling in these regions . in the umbrella sampling simulations",
    "we use 50 umbrella windows ( @xmath122 ) each longing for @xmath123 .",
    "the initial configuration is always set to the face - face configuration .",
    "each spring is characterized by a spring constant of @xmath124 and an equilibrium length of @xmath125 .",
    "the wham - equations for the distance @xmath41 ( see appendix  [ sec : the wham equations ] ) are repeatedly solved until the change in the free energy constants @xmath126 is below @xmath127 .",
    "resulting weights @xmath128 serve as new weights in the multidimensional decomposition [ see eq .  ] .",
    "the start distance in the steered dynamics simulations is set to @xmath129 in a face - face constellation .",
    "then , the second molecule is pulled away from the first with a rate of @xmath130 .",
    "in this section we apply the two sampling methods introduced before to calculate the effective potential of a coronene dimer system at various temperatures @xmath131 .",
    "we first consider the angle - averaged potential @xmath132 . to this end",
    ", we use the same strategies as those described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sampling methods ] , but employ @xmath41 as the only reaction coordinate in eqs .  - .",
    "afterwards we proceed to the angle - resolved case .",
    "we calculated the effective potential @xmath132 at three temperatures , namely @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the angle - averaged effective potential @xmath132 is calculated in analogy to the angle - resolved effective potential ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : definition of the effective pair potential ] ) but with @xmath41 appearing as the only reaction coordinate in eqs .  - .",
    "numerical results obtained via the umbrella sampling and the steered dynamics method are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : angavgpots ] .    the angle - averaged effective potential at different temperatures using steered dynamics ( sd , broken lines ) and umbrella sampling ( us , solid colored lines ) . for comparison",
    "the angle - averaged hard ellipsoidal ( he ) potential for @xmath135 is added . ]",
    "the data reveal a strong temperature dependence of @xmath132 . at the lowest temperature considered ( @xmath133 )",
    "we observe a pronounced attractive potential well with large negative values , corresponding to a coupling strength of about @xmath136 .",
    "contrary to that , the potential at @xmath137 is weakly positive nearly everywhere , reflecting a ( weak ) effective repulsion .",
    "the pronounced temperature dependence of @xmath132 seems not too suprising in view of the amount of variables which have been integrated out . in particular , averaging out the rotations at fixed @xmath41 implies that energetically most attractive configurations are mixed with less attractive ones ; this mixing effect clearly becomes the more important the higher the temperature is .",
    "in fact , in the limit of _ infinite _ temperature one would expect attractive atom - atom interactions to become entirely irrelevant , yielding a purely entropic effective interaction determined by only the steric repulsion between the particles .",
    "this `` entropic limit '' of @xmath132 should be close to the angle - averaged potential of two hard ellipsoidal disks ( he ) .",
    "numerical results for the latter are included in fig .",
    "[ fig : angavgpots ] ( the data have been obtained in analogy to that between coronene molecules ) . inspecting then the temperature dependence of",
    "@xmath132 we see that , at @xmath135 , we are not yet in the entropic limit but are clearly approaching it .",
    "a further interesting feature revealed by fig .  [ fig : angavgpots ] is that , quite independent of the temperature , the range of @xmath132 is always about @xmath138 .",
    "finally , we see that the two sampling methods yield numerically consistent results except for minor differences in the range @xmath139 at @xmath140 .",
    "we now turn to the central issue of this article , that is , the angle dependence of the effective potentials .",
    "we first focus on the case @xmath141 .",
    "corresponding results for the angle - resolved potentials are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potcurves800kmixed ] , where we concentrate on the configurations introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical details ] .",
    "it is seen that all configurations are characterized by an attractive well at short distances . however",
    ", the position of the potential minimum and its depth strongly depend on the specific orientation .",
    "the most attractive configurations are those with a large contact area of the particles , that is , the face - face and parallel - displaced configurations [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : potcurves800kmixed](a ) ] . among these",
    ", the most attractive one is not the perfect face - face ( as one might have expected ) , but the weakly parallel displaced configuration .",
    "the corresponding potential depth is larger by about a factor of twenty as compared to that of the edge - edge and cross configuration .",
    "comparing now the two sampling methods , we find the us and sd method to be generally consistent , with the accuracy of each method depending somewhat on the intermolecular distance considered . at short distances ,",
    "the potential curves are better described by the sd technique , while the us method is superior ( in terms of roughness ) at larger distances . moreover",
    ", the us technique provides a particularly efficient sampling of the orientation configuration at fixed distance @xmath41 . to improve the performance of this latter technique at small distances one could use larger spring constants or adaptive us techniques  @xcite .",
    "we also note the two methods , us and sd , have already been compared in ref .   for the case of one reaction coordinate .",
    "in that study , it was found that sd requires an order of magnitude longer simulation runs to obtain the same accuracy as the us method .",
    "this is consistent with our observations and can be seen for configurations with a large contact distance [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : potcurves800kmixed](c ) ] .",
    "we next consider the influence of temperature on the angle dependent potentials .",
    "figure  [ potcurvestemperature](a ) plots as an example sd results for the face - face configuration at three temperatures .",
    "it is seen that there is , indeed , a temperature dependence , but this dependence is less pronounced than in the case of the angle - averaged potential @xmath132 ( see fig .  [",

    "the latter involves , in principle , all aspects observed in our numerical data , that is , anisotropy , softness , and attraction at short length scales .",
    "the advantage of such a parametrization is that all potential values can be accessed without any smoothing or extrapolation .",
    "moreover , the calculation of forces and torques is strongly simplified .",
    "specifically , we consider a modification of the original gb model which was introduced by kabadi  @xcite .",
    "the modification involves a coefficient @xmath144 which acts as a factor on the well width of the original gb potential .",

    "however , it should be noted that the strength multiplicator @xmath163 does not correspond any more to the potential depth of the cross configuration .",
    "we are now in the position to parametrize our coarse - grained potentials . in the subsequent paragraph sec .",
    "[ sec : proposed interaction model ( m ) ] we first introduce a parameter choice , which we call model m and which later turned out to be superior in representing various dimer configurations as compared to other parameter choices described in sec .",

    "specifically , our parameter fit builds on the four attractive wells stemming from the parallel weakly displaced , parallel displaced , t and edge - edge configuration . the main reason to pick those configurations",

[ fig : potfits](a)-(j ) illustrate two important features of model m : first , although the construction of the parameter set involves only four configurations , the model gives good results ( as compared to the original coarse - grained potential ) also for other configurations , such as v configuration . only the face - face configuration is slightly overestimated .",
    "second , model m is _ intrinsically consistent _ in the sense that , when performing an angle average over the fit results , one arrives at a potential which is very close to the angle - averaged numerical coarse - grained potential discussed in sec .",
