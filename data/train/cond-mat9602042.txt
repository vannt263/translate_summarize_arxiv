    "the theory of the electronic band - structure of solids is one of the oldest theories in condensed - matter physics , dating back to 1928 when bloch proved the existence of electronic bands in solids@xcite .",
    "it was soon discovered that most metals could be described with the _ nearly free electron model _ where the periodic ion potential felt by the electrons is weak .",
    "initial emphasis in the development of band theory focused on one - dimensional models where both transfer - matrix results@xcite and exact solutions@xcite could be found .",
    "it was only after the development of the pseudopotential method@xcite in the 1960 s that the success of the nearly free electron model was understood .    in the 1950 s ,",
    "peierls@xcite reexamined the perturbation theory for the nearly free electron model and found that , in one - dimension , a _",
    "static _ distortion would always reduce the energy of a solid , because the opening of a gap ( at the fermi level ) in the electronic band - structure would lower the energy of the occupied electronic states and raise the energy of the unoccupied states .",
    "such a distortion would produce an _ insulator _ from the parent _ metal _ and peierls s work led to the conclusion that there can never be a one - dimensional metal .",
    "frhlich@xcite used nearly degenerate perturbation theory to show that the decrease in the electronic energy was on the order of @xmath5 for a periodic distortion of amplitude @xmath6 , while the elastic energy was on the order of @xmath7 , so the net effect of the distortion was to reduce the ground - state energy ( if @xmath6 was small enough ) .",
    "two chemists , longuet - higgins and salem@xcite , independently arrived at the same conclusions by examining a general class of hamiltonians for ring - shaped molecules .",
    "note that these conclusions explicitly neglect the quantum fluctuations of the phonons about the distorted state , a feature which can lead to a stabilization of the undistorted phase , as illustrated in recent rigorous work on the one - dimensional holstein model.@xcite    the peierls distortion is generally studied at half - filling for the electrons , in which case the distortion leads to a doubling of the unit cell .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that the _ lowest _ periodic structure that produces a gap at the fermi level will be the true ground state , or , in other words , the peierls distortion is stable against any higher - order distortions .",
    "this result has been recently proven to be true at half filling@xcite .    in one dimension ,",
    "the restriction to half - filling is not necessary , since the same arguments used by peierls in his original discussion , could be extended to arbitrary electron filling , with the result that a periodic distortion that produces a gap at the fermi level will always lower the total energy of the system .",
    "furthermore , one can generalize peierls arguments to include other models , such as models for alloy formation .",
    "historically , these alloy models were studied before the models of lattice distortions , where hume - rothery@xcite pointed out that certain alloys form only when the electron - atom ratio fell within very narrow ranges . in one - dimension ,",
    "peierls - like arguments establish the hume - rothery rule , since the periodic arrangement of the ions will always produce the largest gap at the fermi level . in the alloy picture , it is the periodic ordering of the ions that creates the band structure with a gap at the fermi level , and it is a reasonable assumption to neglect the quantum fluctuations that would be induced if the ions became itinerant since the energetics of interchanging two ionic species should be large in a one - dimensional system .    the simplest model of a binary alloy is the spinless falicov - kimball model@xcite in which itinerant spinless electrons interact with static ions : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the creation operator for an electron at site @xmath10",
    ", @xmath11 is a classical variable that is 1 if the site is occupied by an a ion and 0 if the site is occupied by a b ion .",
    "the hopping integral is @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes the difference in on - site energies for an electron on a b site minus that of an electron on an a site .",
    "the electron density , @xmath14 , is the number of electrons per site @xmath15 , and similarly the ion density @xmath16 is the number of a ions per site ( @xmath17 with @xmath18 the number of lattice sites .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamic limit , and so we take @xmath19 , but maintain finite values for both @xmath14 and @xmath16 . in the alloy picture @xmath20 , one can envision that the electrons are donated by one of the ionic species ( say the a ion ) , in which case a study of the neutral case ( where @xmath21 ) becomes most relevant .",
    "this model was first proposed by falicov and kimball@xcite to discuss semiconductor - insulator transitions in certain rare - earth oxides and borides . at zero temperature",
    ", the electrons are localized on the sites of the metallic ions . as the temperature",
    "is increased , itinerant electrons and localized holes are simultaneously produced by excitation .",
    "the coulomb interaction is screened out , except for the on - site hole - hole repulsion , which is very strong ( hard - core repulsion ) and the on - site electron - hole attraction , which was assumed to be responsible for the transition . in this case , @xmath13 is positive , and the system is neutral @xmath22 .",
    "later , the same model was employed to study ordering of rare - earth ions in mixed - valence systems@xcite . in this application ,",
    "the itinerant electrons are @xmath23-electrons , and the static particles are localized @xmath24-electrons .",
    "the interaction is then repulsive @xmath25 , and conservation of the total number of electrons leads to @xmath26 , with the constant usually taken to be one .",
    "more recently@xcite , work on the falicov - kimball model has focused on another aspect , that of periodic crystal formation . in this language",
    "the a sites are ions , and the b sites are empty sites .",
    "the question is whether or not the interaction of the ions with the electrons , coupled with the fact that the electrons satisfy the pauli exclusion principle , is sufficient to cause a periodic arrangement of the ions to be the ground - state configuration .",
    "this is the language that we adopt in this contribution .",
    "the falicov - kimball model is probably the simplest many - body physics problem .",
    "the many - body - physics aspect of the problem enters when one considers an _ annealed _ average over all possible ion configurations @xmath27 . at zero temperature ,",
    "one searches for the ion configuration that minimizes the energy of the electrons subject to the relevant constraints that are applied to the system .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_fk ] ) exhibits two different symmetries:@xcite an ion - occupied  empty - site symmetry and an electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the first symmetry relates the ground - state energy ( per site ) for the configuration of ions @xmath27 to the energy of the conjugate configuration @xmath28 @xmath29 while the second symmetry employs the unitary transformation @xmath30 that changes electrons to holes , yielding @xmath31 these two symmetries allow restriction to the region @xmath32 and @xmath33 , without a loss in generality .",
    "the falicov - kimball model has been actively studied in recent years , ever since kennedy and lieb@xcite and brandt and schmidt@xcite independently proved that the period - two phase is the ground state for all @xmath13 when the electron and the ion densities are both equal to @xmath4 .",
    "most emphasis has concentrated on the one - dimensional model , where numerical studies@xcite indicated that the system phase separated into the segregated phase ( where all the ions cluster on one side of the lattice ) for large enough interaction strength if @xmath34 or @xmath35 . in the other cases , where @xmath22 ( the neutral case ) and @xmath36 , or @xmath37 ( the mixed - valence case ) and @xmath38 , it was conjectured that the most homogeneous phase was the ground state .",
    "these two conjectures have already been proven to be true@xcite .",
    "another conjecture , based upon the many - body version of rayleigh - schroedinger perturbation theory , stated that in the small @xmath13 limit the ground - state configuration will be the configuration that produces the largest gap at the fermi level , and this state was shown to have the smallest periodicity that could produce a gap at the fermi level ( consistent with the peierls picture ) .",
    "recent analytical@xcite and numerical@xcite work on the neutral case has shown , however , that at low electron density , there is a tendency for molecule formation , rather than a homogeneous distribution of the ions , and a phase - separated configuration of ions may yield a lower energy than a pure periodic phase .    in the spirit of the nearly free electron model ,",
    "we establish two rigorous results which are valid for @xmath13 sufficiently small :    first , we show that if the electron density is @xmath39 with @xmath2 relatively prime to @xmath3 , and @xmath40 , with @xmath41 for some integer @xmath42 , then the ground - state configuration is a phase - separated mixture of period-@xmath3 phases , and possibly the empty ( or full ) lattice .",
    "the second result is a statement about the stability of the pure period-@xmath3 phase for @xmath39 ( with @xmath2 relatively prime to @xmath3 ) and @xmath43 . for @xmath44",
    "$ ] with @xmath45 [ solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : transcend ] ) ] , the ground state has period @xmath3 and is the most homogeneous configuration ; it also has the smallest periodicity needed to produce a gap at the fermi level .",
    "on the other hand , if the ion density @xmath43 is smaller than @xmath46 or greater than @xmath47 , then the ground state is always a phase - separated mixture of a phase with @xmath39 , @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) and a period-@xmath3 phase with @xmath50 , @xmath51 a rational that is closest to @xmath52 in a well - defined sense . for @xmath53 or @xmath54 ,",
    "the same is true , i.  e. the ground state is a phase - separated mixture , except for special values of @xmath16 [ those satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_stability ] ) ] for which the period-@xmath3 phase is stable .",
    "these results show that the close analogy with the peierls instability is valid only for @xmath55 .",
    "we view the analogy as follows : for @xmath56 ( and @xmath39 , @xmath43 fixed ) any ion configuration is a ground state , i.  e. the probability to find an ion at a given site is uniform and equals @xmath16 .",
    "this uniform - density state is the `` undistorted state '' , has no gap in the electronic spectrum , and is metallic . for @xmath57 ,",
    "sufficiently small , a particular ion configuration is selected which has period @xmath3 .",
    "it corresponds to the peierls - fr \" olich `` distorted state '' , which has a gap at the fermi level and is insulating . for @xmath58 or @xmath59 , the ground state is ( in general )",
    "phase separated and is a mixture of a metallic and an insulating state .",
    "this situation does not have a counterpart in the standard theory of peierls and fr \" ohlich .",
    "finally , the above results establish the existence of a phase transition in the ground state of the falicov - kimball model when @xmath13 is varied . for densities such that the ground state is a phase - separated mixture ( for @xmath13 sufficiently small ) there must be a phase transition as @xmath13 increases .",
    "indeed , for @xmath13 sufficiently large , the ground state is known to be either the most - homogeneous phase or the segregated phase ( which is a different phase - separated state ) .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows : in section ii the perturbation theory is developed showing the @xmath60 behavior of the ground - state energy for small @xmath13 ; in section iii the perturbation - theory results are analyzed to show when pure phases are the ground state and when the ground state is phase - separated ; a discussion follows in section iv .",
    "it is most convenient to rewrite the falicov - kimball hamiltonian in a momentum - space representation before developing a perturbation - series expansion for the ground - state energy . using the standard fourier",
    "transform @xmath61 ( with the lattice spacing set equal to 1 ) yields @xmath62 a_k^{\\dagger}a_k -u\\sum_{k\\ne k^{\\prime } } w(k - k^{\\prime } ) a_k^{\\dagger}a_{k^{\\prime}}\\quad , \\label{eq : h_mom}\\ ] ] for the hamiltonian of the falicov - kimball model in momentum space .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 are restricted to the first brillouin zone @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the unperturbed band - structure .",
    "@xmath67 is the structure factor of the period-@xmath68 ion configuration @xmath27 @xmath69 defined for @xmath70 .",
    "( it is notationally simpler here to define the @xmath63-vectors with @xmath71 to sometimes lie outside of the first brillouin zone .",
    "of course , translation by @xmath72 will shift these vectors back into the first brillouin zone . )",
    "note that @xmath73 by definition .",
    "we begin by performing the many - body version of rayleigh - schroedinger perturbation theory with the double - summation term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_mom ] ) acting as the perturbation .",
    "the analysis is straightforward@xcite , requiring a momentum - space integral that can be evaluated analytically , yielding @xmath74 for the ground - state energy of configuration @xmath27 .    the perturbative expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rs_mb ] ) has a singularity when the electron density is rational @xmath39 and the ion configuration has a period that is a multiple of @xmath3 ( with the exception of those ion configurations whose relevant structure factor vanishes ) .",
    "it was argued heuristically in ref .   that the configuration with the maximal singularity ( i. e. , with the maximal value of @xmath75 ) will be the ground - state configuration , and this result agreed with the numerical work .",
    "however , such logic is flawed , because the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rs_mb ] ) is valid for @xmath76 , which can not hold when an integral number of electronic subbands are filled ( i. e. , when @xmath77 ) .",
    "this result was known by frhlich@xcite , and it arises from the fact that there are degeneracies in the unperturbed wavefunction that were neglected in the above analysis .",
    "it is easiest to see the origin of the degeneracies and how to properly treat them by examining the perturbation theory of the single - particle energy levels .",
    "wigner - brillouin perturbation theory is used , because it automatically removes the singularities .",
    "the ground - state energy is found by simply filling up the lowest available single - particle energy levels in the system .",
    "these energy levels can be expanded in a perturbation series which yields @xmath78 to second order in @xmath13 .",
    "the quasiparticle energy @xmath79 appears on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wb_qp ] ) because one must self - consistently solve for the energy in a wigner - brillouin perturbation - theory expansion . the equivalent rayleigh - schroedinger expansion would replace @xmath80 by @xmath81 in the right hand side of ( [ eq : wb_qp ] ) which produces a singularity when @xmath82 because @xmath83 .    at this point , textbooks note that the dominant term in the sum over @xmath84 , in the right - hand side of eq .",

    "this procedure is sometimes called nearly degenerate perturbation theory because it produces the correct secular equation in the degenerate case .",

    "we want to concentrate on the higher - order terms .",
    "the solution for the quasiparticle energies reveals that a generic period-@xmath68 configuration will break into @xmath68 subbands .",

    "the band theory of solids is perhaps the defining theory for condensed - matter physics .",
    "it has been applied to virtually every interesting material that has been studied . nevertheless , the conventional wisdom of peierls and frhlich for optimizing the band - structure for the ground - state of one - dimensional crystals is not always correct .",
    "they argue , that the ion configuration that produces the largest gap at the fermi level will yield the ground state .",
    "we find that this argument is true for a nearly free electron model only if the ion density is close enough to half - filling .",
    "for ion densities away from half - filling , the system will phase separate into a mixture of states that have the same electron density , but have different ion densities ( @xmath244 and @xmath16 close to 0.371 or @xmath245 and @xmath16 close to 0.629 ) .",
    "it is possible that this phase separation can be observed in quasi - one - dimensional metals and insulators .",
    "we are not aware of any experiments that have seen this phase separation .",
    "our rigorous results hold only for @xmath13 sufficiently small because they are based on perturbation - theory arguments that maximize the leading corrections of the ground - state energy as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "since these corrections of order @xmath60 will compete with order @xmath97 corrections for finite values of @xmath13 , the phase separation discovered here may rapidly disappear as @xmath13 increases .",
    "numerical evidence indicates that this is true for the densities between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , but larger values of @xmath13 are necessary for the densities near 0 or 1 .",
    "furthermore , since the ground state is known to be either a different phase - separated state ( nonneutral cases ) or the most - homogeneous state ( neutral case ) for large @xmath13 , the spinless falicov - kimball model must have a phase transition as a function of @xmath13 . in the neutral case , when the ground state is not a phase - separated state , but is the peierls - type state that maximizes the band gap at the fermi level , it is possible that the ground state has no phase transitions for @xmath246 , since the small-@xmath13 ground state is identical to the large-@xmath13 ground state .",
    "we are unable to prove this conjecture here .",
    "our analysis was restricted to the spinless falicov - kimball model , but the general ideas may also hold for more complicated models such as tertiary alloy problems ( where @xmath11 would assume three different values ) or the static holstein model ( where @xmath11 is continuous ) , but the determination of the maximal structure factor becomes much more complicated , since one must maximize with respect to both the phase and the amplitude , as opposed to maximizing only with respect to the phase , as we did here .",
