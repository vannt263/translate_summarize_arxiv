    "@xcite for the subcase of axisymmetric spacetimes . in such anisotropic inflationary models ,",
    "the shear is always dominating at early time so that the universe behaves as a kasner spacetime .",
    "it was realized that this anisotropic early era has an important signature since gravity waves are amplified during this era  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this stage is usually short and this instability is transient .",
    "however this has led to question the stability of a pure kasner universe  @xcite .",
    "the kasner spacetimes  @xcite are vacuum solutions of the einstein field equations .",
    "they describe universes which are spatially homogeneous and euclidean but with an anisotropic expansion .",
    "they play an important role in cosmology since they are a key structure in the discussion of the dynamics of spatially homogeneous spacetimes close to the singularity .",
    "belinsky , khalatnikov and lifshitz  @xcite and misner  @xcite investigated the nature of the cosmological singularity by means of a bianchi  ix model , whose temporal behaviour toward the singularity was shown to be described by a sequence of anisotropic kasner era .",
    "this has led to the mixmaster picture  @xcite and the idea of the cosmic billiard  @xcite that can offer a description of the geometry of the universe prior to inflation .",
    "the stability of this picture was already adressed in ref .",

    "@xcite . only recently was it revisited  @xcite in light of the recent developments concerning bianchi  i universe perturbations  @xcite in the particular case of a kasner universe with an axial symmetry , but no general study of the stability to linear perturbations of a kasner spacetime with arbitrary exponents has been performed yet .",
    "this is the goal of this article .",
    "we limit our analysis to the study of the stability of the kasner spacetime to linear perturbations . indeed , this can exhibit some instabilities but does not allow to demonstrate the general stability when no instability is exhibited at linear order in the perturbations .",
    "for instance , the stability of the minkowski spacetime to linear perturbation is an easy exercise while the general proof of stability is extremely challenging  @xcite .",
    "also some spacetimes may be unstable to a particular class of perturbations while stable in other cases .",
    "for instance , the einstein static universe was shown to be unstable with respect to spatially homogeneous and isotropic perturbations  @xcite while it was then understood that the issue was not that simple when harrison  @xcite demonstrated that all physical inhomogeneous modes are oscillatory if the matter content was a radiation fluid , while gibbons  @xcite demonstrated the stability against conformal metric perturbations when the matter content was a fluid with sound speed larger that @xmath0 .",
    "finally  @xcite , it was shown that the einstein static spacetime is neutrally stable against small inhomogeneous vector and tensor perturbations and neutrally stable against adiabatic scalar density inhomogeneities as long as the condition exhibited by gibbons holds , and unstable otherwise .",
    "our analysis is somehow simplified by the fact that the kasner spacetimes are empty so that we need no assumption on the matter content or on the type of perturbations considered .",
    "once the evolution of the linear perturbation is determined , in a gauge invariant formalism to ensure that no gauge mode can spoil the conclusion , we compute the invariants of the metric and compare them to those of the background . again , since the kasner spacetime is empty , only the square of the weyl tensor has to be considered .",
    "this ensures that the conclusion is not affected by the choice of gauge or coordinates system .    in this article",
