    "abraham maslow , + _ the psychology of science _",
    "a well - known syndrome introduced by abraham maslow is the so - called `` law of the instrument '' , stating that solutions to problems are often influenced by the tools available off - the - shelf  @xcite .",
    "this obviously introduces limitations and inefficiencies . a typical case in point",
    "is given by information and communication technology ( ict ) solutions to the problem of fall identification .",
    "falls are the `` most significant cause of injury for elderly persons ''  @xcite  more specifically `` the most serious life - threatening events that can occur '' in the 65 + age group  @xcite . although not a frequent event , it is one whose consequences are often of the most concern  @xcite , especially in the case proper treatment is not timely dispatched to the fallen person . a common `` tool '' to deal with this problem is fall detection devices .",
    "such devices  for instance accelerometers , gyroscopes , or other sensors  constantly monitor a person and trigger an alarm when some safety threshold is reached .",
    "a major limitation and inefficiency of this approach is due to the current difficulties of our algorithms and their implementations to provide reliable assessments of real - life situations . despite the continuing technological progress , it is still very difficult for an ict monitoring device to determine whether a person has actually fallen or if , e.g. , he or she has knelt down very quickly . the use of redundancy  by coupling , for instance , two accelerometers of different technology and design ) improves the sensitivity ( i.e. , reduces the false negative rate ) , though this is often reached at the price of increasing the false alarm ratio ( i.e. , reducing the specificity ) .",
    "the already high social costs are thus exacerbated by unnecessary interventions due to false alarms .    how to deal with this problem ?",
    "one way is to try and improve the current tools .",
    "purely ict solutions to fall detection assessment are the subject of numerous research actions , which results in improvements in both sensitivity and specificity . despite those efforts , `` no silver bullet [ is ] in sight [ yet ] ''  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to widen our horizons and look for different and better approaches . in this paper",
    "we discuss one such approach .",
    "we propose to go beyond the purely technological solution and to integrate humans in the system .",
    "the resulting socio - technological system is introduced and analyzed here by means of a multi - agent simulation model .",
    "we show that by integrating information from the cyber- and the physical domain and by appointing verification tasks to a `` cloud '' of human agents it is possible to overcome , to some extent , the current limitations and inefficiencies of purely ict - based solutions .    in what follows we first briefly recall in sect .",

    "the event did not take place , but the system `` fired '' .",
    "every occurrence of said wrong conclusion is called a _",

    "a problem we tackle in this paper is the well - known correlation between fp and fn .",
    "whatever the method in use today , if one wants to reduce fn rate , usually fp rate goes up  @xcite . in what follows we are going to introduce a method to deal with this problem based on the use of `` social energy , '' which we defined in  @xcite as `` the self - serve , self - organization , and self - adaptability potentials of our societies . ''",
    "as a first component of our solution we now briefly introduce the main elements of the organizational structure that we call `` fractal social organizations . ''",
    "fractal social organizations ( fso ) is an organizational structure that realizes a nested compositional hierarchy  @xcite ( nch ) : the system is a network of nodes , each of which is a network of other nodes .",
    "fso nodes are called circles . being",
    "a nch means that the fso is structured as concentric circles .",
    "examples of said circles may be for instance an employee of a business enterprise ; an office of that enterprise ; the whole business enterprise ; or a business ecosystem including several business bodies . in each fso circle",
    "there is a node that coordinates that circle .",
    "said coordinator node receives notification data from all the nodes of its circle .",
    "notifications received by the coordinator describe the evolving of situational and context information .",
    "this means that any node state change and also any detected external change are reported .",
    "the circle coordinator is an autonomic computing agent implementing a mape loop .",
    "received data is fed into the loop s `` m '' component  namely , its perception organ .",
    "once received , data is analyzed and integrated ( by the `` a '' component ) and semantically matched with the information already known to the coordinator .",
    "deductions are fed into a the planner component ( `` p '' ) , which selects a response protocol through a simple algorithm .",
    "the selected protocol is then executed by component `` e '' .",
    "protocols are associated at design time to state transitions and situation identifications .",
    "if , for instance , situation @xmath2 = `` fall suspected in flat 145 '' is associated to protocol @xmath3 , then as soon as @xmath2 is identified protocol @xmath3 is readied for running .    a readied protocol is a protocol that has been authorized for launching though is not running yet .",
    "protocols in fact require the availability of one or more _",
    "agents_. protocol @xmath3 may need , e.g. , the cooperation of a general practitioner , a nurse , an ambulance , an ambulance driver , and specific medical devices .    in order to launch a protocol",
    ", the coordinator needs to enroll agents : assign agents to the needed roles .",
    "this is similar to data - flow , only it requires active roles instead of data . because of this similarity , we call this a _ role - flow approach_. an alternative way to describe the fso protocols is to consider them as _ guarded actions _  @xcite whose guards express the successful enrollment of agents .    an important aspect of fso is the fact that the coordinator does not care whether a candidate actor is a professional carer , a volunteer , a patient , or a machine .",
    "the agent just needs to _ qualify _ for the sought role .",
    "this means that agents need to be known beforehand in order to play significant roles in an fso .",
    "knowing an agent means having a semantic description of what the agent may do .",
    "more information about this ma be found in  @xcite .",
    "no semantic processing is used in our simulation models due to their simple formulation .    if the coordinator can find agents for all the roles it requires , the protocol starts . if not",
    ", there is what we call a _",
    "role exception_. this means that the circle coordinator publishes a new event in the `` parent circle'' the circle that includes the current circle as a node .",
    "if not all the requested agents can be enrolled in the parent circle , this results in a new role exception . through this mechanism",
    "the coordinators `` spread the news '' about the missing roles throughout the levels of the network .",
    "as soon as enrollment is completed , the enrolled agents become a new transient fso whose aim and lifespan is defined by the execution of their associated protocol .",
    "we call said transient fso a `` social overlay network . ''",
    "this realizes inter - organizational collaboration and shifts the responsibility for service response composition from the user to the `` system''more information about this is provided in  @xcite .",
    "fso circles are structured as so - called service - oriented communities ( soc s ) .",
    "they are described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "a special case of soc is given by a person and a periphery of devices that the person has access to .",
    "we call such soc an individual soc ( isoc ) .    figure  [ f : fso ] represents the set of all possible social overlay networks in an fso including six roles ( roles 05 ) and 12 agents distributed as follows : role 0 , role 1 , and role 5 are played by 3 agents each while role 2 , role 3 , and role 4 are played by 1 agent each .",
    "for our simulations we use netlogo  @xcite , a tool that allows agent - based rapid prototyping .",
    "netlogo provides a simulation area that functions as a virtual world in which events are triggered on the initialized agents in discrete time steps called `` ticks '' .",
    "the simulation area includes several classes of agents , which are described in what follows .",
    "elderly agents @xmath4s are agents representing elderly or impaired persons .",
    "@xmath4s are assumed not to leave their house , in which their condition is monitored by device agents ( see definition  [ d : da ] ) .",
    "[ d : ea ]    professional carers @xmath4s represent agents able to supply certified healthcare services to other agents .",
    "such agents are _ institutional _ , meaning that their action is regulated by rules , laws , and a professional code of service .",
    "this translates into relative high availability and guarantees of timely intervention .",
    "in- formal carers @xmath4s are mobile agents that are able to provide non - professional services . in what follows",
    "it is assumed that @xmath4s can move to the location of an and report whether that _ ea _ has truly experienced a fall or not .",
    "this operation is called in what follows _",
    "verification_. symbol @xmath5 shall be used to represent a verification carried out by agent @xmath6 .",
    "[ d : da ] device agents @xmath4s are simple purposefully - behaviored   devices ( as , e.g. , accelerometers , gyroscopes , motion sensors , cameras , combustion detectors , etc . ) that are able to provide domotica or telemonitoring services .",
    "in particular an accelerometer and a gyroscope both trigger an alarm when they ascertain , with a certain probability , that an has fallen .",
    "another example of is a motion sensor estimating the motion vector of an moving in his or her house .",
    "as already mentioned , da are characterized by a non - zero probability of fp s and fn s .",
    "thus for instance in some cases an accelerometer may detect a fall when this is not true , while in some other cases that accelerometer may not detect a true case of fall .",
    "mobile agents @xmath4s are agents able to provide extended mobility services to other agents . in what follows a single type of",
    "is employed , which represents ambulances .",
    "com- munity agents @xmath4s are agents coordinating a `` circle '' of other agents . in what follows",
    "it is assumed that s implement the set of rules and actions of s , namely the building blocks of the organizational structure introduced in sect .",
    "[ s : fso ] .",
    "the rules and coordination actions are called the _ canon _ of the  .",
    "s may be implemented as middleware components as described in , e.g. , .",
    "[ d : ca ]      the fso adopted in our simulations is structured into three concentric levels :    1 .   the innermost level is constituted by isoc s ( see sect .  [",
    "s : fso ] ) coupling an ea with one or more da s that continuously `` watch '' the ea in order to assess whether a fall event has taken place .",
    "each of the isoc also includes a ca , called in what follows `` l1-ca '' ( level-1 ca ) .",
    "isoc s correspond to primary users of ambient assisted living ( aal ) services  @xcite .",
    "they could be visualized , e.g. , as a smart house inhabited by an elderly person . 2 .",
    "the middle level is an soc that includes the isoc s ( represented by their l1-ca s ) , a number of ic agents , and a coordinating ca .",
    "the latter shall be called in what follows `` l2-ca '' ( level-2 ca ) .",
    "this soc corresponds to primary and secondary users ( _ sensu _",
    "the elderly people , their relatives , and a `` cloud '' of informal carers may be used to visualize the second level of our fso .",
    "3 .   the outermost fso level is constituted by the middle level soc ( represented by its l2-ca ) , a number of pc and ma agents , and a coordinating ca ( `` l3-ca '' ) .",
    "this soc represents all the aal stakeholders in a certain region  including the infrastructures those stakeholder have access to .    as already discussed in sect .",
    "[ s : fso ] , the agents associated with a coordinating ca send it notifications . whenever there is a need for communication between the ca s of distinct levels , `` exception '' messages are triggered .",
    "it is assumed that these messages are transmitted reliably and instantaneously .",
    "the overall fso structure is depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : elderpersonsfso ] .",
    "the operation of the fso is as follows : the ea s in the innermost isoc may or may not experience falls . at the same time , the da s associated to the ea s may or may not issue their `` fall detected '' event . when they do , the event reaches l1-ca .",
    "four are the major protocols that may be executed :    1 .",
    "protocol @xmath7 corresponds to a request for care requiring a pc and a ma .",
    "as both roles are missing , this triggers an exception , namely an event for l2-ca .",
    "no agents may be enrolled in the middle level of the fso as that soc lacks pc and ma agents . as a consequence , a new exception ensues .",
    "the event thus reaches l3-ca where agents are enrolled and the readied protocol @xmath8 is finally launched . because of this , a general practitioner leaves his or her hospital with an ambulance directed to the house the `` fail detected '' event originated from . 2 .",
    "protocol @xmath9 corresponds to a request for verification .",
    "as verification requires an ic agent it may be considered as a secondary care intervention . in this case",
    "the event is resolved in the middle level of the fso .",
    "enrollment follows and @xmath9 is launched .",
    "the verification step is concluded with either a confirmation or a cancellation of the `` fall event '' . in the latter case ,",
    "a `` fp event '' is issued by the ic agent .",
    "3 .   as we have just described , an `` fp event '' takes place in the middle level of the fso and readies a third protocol , @xmath10 .",
    "said protocol is only used to forward the fp event to the outermost level .",
    "to do so , the protocol simply `` enrolls '' the l3-ca agent .",
    "obviously l2-ca has no actor able to play role l3-ca , thus an exception is raised and delivers the fp event to its intended consignee .",
    "the arrival of the fp event at l3-ca triggers a fourth protocol , @xmath11 , which requires no roles and thus immediately cancels @xmath7 .    canceling a protocol means that , _ if the protocol is still being executed , _ its execution is aborted .",
    "actors involved in a canceled protocol are again available for enrollment in readied protocols . in the case of a pc and ma ,",
    "canceling a @xmath7 protocol makes both agents reach their `` base of operation '' ( i.e. , a hospital . )",
    "note that if the execution of @xmath7 is very fast , the pc and ma may reach the ea sooner than the ic .",
    "in a such a case it is @xmath9 that is canceled .",
    "if so , the enrolled ic is `` freed '' and resumes its `` random walk '' through the virtual world .",
    "a visualization of the simulation area containing the initialized agents can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : simarea ] .",
    "the green `` person '' shape represents the ea agents , while the connected devices represent the da s .",
    "the white building represents the hospital , and connected to it we have the ma s and pc s .",
    "here we first introduce in sect .",
    "[ s : sce : met ] a number of figures used to summarize the results of our simulations .",
    "simulation scenarios are then described in sect .",
    "[ s : sce : sce ] .",
    "we shall call social cost ( _ sc _ ) of agent @xmath12 the number of cycles that @xmath12 makes use of to intervene for either a true alarm or a fp .    from its definition",
    "it is apparent that , in case of a fp , the social costs associated with the agents responding to the alarm are wasted .",
    "metric is defined as the overall number of cycles used by all of a community s agents to deal with the true alarms and fp s experienced during a simulation run .",
    "the number of treated cases ( ) is the total amount of alarms  either true cases or that took place in the course of a simulation run .",
    "normalized cumulative social cost ( ) is given by the ratio @xmath13    waiting time is the number of cycles elapsed from the event of a triggered alarm to either of the following events : the arrival of care ; the canceling of the care request ; confirmation of fp ; the end of the simulation run .    is the sum of all the individual @xmath4s that took place during a simulation run .",

    "this is because the higher the number of ic s , the sooner validation will occur .    results can be seen in figures  [ f : reqshandled][f : avgwtimes ] .     and @xmath21 with a number of ic s ranging from 0 to 40.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the fn values in @xmath18 are almost thrice those in @xmath21 for @xmath17 .",
    "this is because in @xmath21 an and operation is performed between the fn outcome of da1 and da2 ( see again table  [ t : s2 ] ) . as a result",
    "the probability of having a fn decreases in @xmath21 , and only when we have a fn from both alarms the fn is reported .",
    "with @xmath53 we see that the addition of ic s does nt produce improvements .",
    "this is because in our simulation models ic s can not identify fn s .",
    "the graph in figure  [ f : fpratio ] depicts the fp ratios of @xmath18 , and @xmath21 with various number of ic s .",
    "the fn ratios are visualized in figure  [ f : fnratio ]",
    ".    a larger number of alarms and a smaller number of fn s translates into a more sensitive system .",
    "this is because by triggering more alarms , more cases where the alarm is truly positive are covered . on the other hand",
    ", there is no difference observed with regard to the specificity parameter for each scenario . from the results in table  [ t : s1 ] and table  [ t : s2 ] we see that in @xmath18 , with or without volunteers , the average sensitivity is 79.55% , while for @xmath21 it increases to an average of 89.92% .",
    "the specificity values stay the same for all scenarios with an average close to 99% .",
    "we now focus our attention to social costs .",
    "if we compare @xmath54 with the case where ic s are added , we observe a significant decrease in the cost of ma s .",
    "this is because the ic s help verifying the actual condition of the ea agents , thus reducing the cost of ma s .",
    "the same applies for the @xmath21 scenarios .",
    "figure  [ f : avgmacost ] depicts the relation between and @xmath16 for both scenarios . in the case of @xmath18 ,",
    "the minimum is reached for 20 ic s after which average social cost appears to stabilize .",
    "another metric that shows the impact of ic s in the ma cost is the number of alarm verification s . in all scenarios where ic s are present",
    "the number of verifications performed by means of ma s is reduced drastically .     and @xmath21 with a number of ic s ranging from 0 to 40.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and @xmath21 with a number of ic s ranging from 0 to 40.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a significant metric is the average time until a triggered alarm for an ea gets verified , namely .",
    "the average waiting time reflects the reaction time of the system for a given event .",
    "the best results are obtained with 10 ic s .",
    "additional effort beyond this value produces little improvement . with 10 ic s",
    "no significant differences are observed between @xmath18 and @xmath21 . a graph showing the average waiting time in function of the number of ic s",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ f : avgwtimes ] .     and @xmath21 with a number of ic s ranging from 0 to 40.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and @xmath21 and a number of ic s ranging from 0 to 40.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we can conclude that the involvement of ic agents in the fall identification system using the fso model helps reducing the social costs , while at the same time the average response time to fall events is reduced .",
    "moreover , it transpires that the involvement of ic agents is beneficial up to some threshold  possibly in function of the dimensions of the virtual word and other simulation parameters .",
    "more and more complex experiments shall follow . in particular we plan to explore the relation between the exhibited amount of social cooperation and an organization s ability to deliver and sustain a given state of `` welfare '' .",
