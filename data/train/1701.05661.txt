    "the model problem to study of time - harmonic waves , with frequency @xmath0 in media with microstructure is @xmath1 where the wave @xmath2 represents the information being propagated , such as pressure in acoustics , deformation in elasticity or electromagnetic fields in electromagnetism the physical nature of the waves under investigation depends on the choice of the domain @xmath3 , with propagation and localisation being studied when @xmath3 is the whole space and vibration modes under investigation for bounded @xmath3 subject to specific boundary conditions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath4 are periodic and characterise the microstructured nature of the media : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are ( the square - root of ) the wave speeds of the individual constitutive material components that make up the composite , see figure [ fig : compositedomain ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 represents the ratio between the observable length scale and the size of the microstructure and is typically small .",
    "studying the asymptotic behaviour of these waves in the limit of vanishing @xmath8 , for fixed frequency , is important in applications and the homogenisation theorem , also called the long - wavelength or quasi - static approximation depending on the community , states that for fixed @xmath9 the wave behaviour of a microstructured media for small enough @xmath8 can be approximated by studying the vibrations of an ` effective ' homogeneous media whose wave speed @xmath10 is constant and determined directly from the ` local periodic ' behaviour of the problem .    it has been known for some time now that the introduction of so - called high contrasts in the coefficients results in unusual effects in microstructured media such as memory effects and other non - local effects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "those high - contrast problems of particular interest in the context of waves are the so - called double porosity models where the coefficients of the ( inclusion ) phase @xmath11 are ` critically ' scaled by taking them to be of the order @xmath12 .",
    "physically , this critical scaling corresponds to the scale of the wave - length of @xmath2 remaining ` long ' within the matrix @xmath13 but in @xmath11 the wavelength is at the ` resonant ' scale , i.e. of the same order as the size of the microstructure , thus violating the underlying intuition for the long - wave length approximation .",
    "v. zhikov @xcite analysed the double porosity spectral problems in bounded @xcite and unbounded @xcite domains by developing the homogenisation theory for generalised double porosity - type problems within the framework of two - scale convergence of g. nguetseng - g .",
    "allaire @xcite .",
    "zhikov derived two - scale limit spectral equations that contain a non - trivial coupling between micro- and macro - scales , and the de - coupling of these scales , which is possible due to certain underlying geometric assumptions , leads to an eigenvalue problem with a highly non - linear dependence described by a function @xmath14 of the spectral parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this @xmath15 function describes in an explicit way the presence of strong band - gaps in applications to wave propagation : frequency bands where no modes can propagate within the medium , @xcite , and has recently been shown to describe the asymptotic structure of the spectral band functions @xcite .",
    "this zhikov @xmath15 function was later interpreted in the works of g. bouchitt and d. felbacq @xcite , in the context of tm polarised electromagnetic waves in a dilute dielectric two - dimensional photonic crystal fibre , as negative effective magnetism . in the context of elasticity ,",
    "a matrix analogue of the @xmath15 function is derived and plays the role of effective density that is frequency dependent @xcite .",
    "aside from the strong spectral band - gaps mentioned above this leads to  weak \" gaps where reduced numbers of modes are allowed to propagate within the medium .",
    "the use of high - contrast media as wave - guides due to the presence of gaps in the spectrum of high - contrast media was studied using multi - scale asymptotics in @xcite and supplemented with analysis based on two - scale convergence in @xcite .",
    "the idea that high - contrast media can result in the appearance of non - standard constitutive laws and give rise to composite media with complex wave phenomena near micro - resonances has prompted a recent energetic pursuit of non - standard constitutive laws in the contexts of elasticity ( e.g. @xcite ) and electromagnetism ( e.g. @xcite ) with applications in areas such as cloaking ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in the work of v. smyshlyaev @xcite , building on related ideas in @xcite , that by increasing the elastic anisotropy of composite media and by considering ",
    "inter - connected \" inclusions then the two - scale homogenised limit contain not only the temporal non - locality given by the zhikov @xmath15 function but also exhibit spatial non - locality .",
    "the presence of which leads to the phenomena of ` directional ' localisation : the number of admissible propagating wave modes depends not only on the frequency but on the direction of propagation .",
    "these works have very recently been complemented with a systematic study containing rigorous asymptotic and spectral analysis of general mathematical constructions containing ` high - contrasts ' @xcite .",
    "analysis based on the work @xcite has led to the demonstration that the two - scale convergence is insufficient to fully study the spectrum of general high - contrast problems , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5),@xcite .",
    "the reason for this inconsistency is due to the presence of quasi - periodic microscopic oscillations that , while are asymptotically negligible due to geometric considerations in previously studied double porosity models , persist at leading - order in general high - contrast media .",
    "the aim of this work is to two - fold .",
    "first we show that by a simple relaxing of the geometric assumptions in the double porosity model , namely the connectedness of the matrix or ` stiff ' phase , leads to two - scale homogenised models that contain a new feature : the effective wave speed depending on the quasi - momenta in a highly discontinuous fashion , i.e. the non - standard constitutive equations for such high - contrast media exhibit spatial dispersion .",
    "the addition of this feature , on top of the temporal non - locality demonstrated by zhikov , and the spatial non - locality demonstrated by smyshlyaev , is due to the additional asymptotic presence of quasi - periodic waves on the microscale .",
    "the second aim of this work is to appropriately develop the two - scale frame - work , laid out in @xcite , for the study of quasi - periodic micro - oscillations in a generalised class of high - contrast problems .",
    "this framework will be used here to perform a spectral analysis of novel high - contrast models and additionally explain why such micro - oscillations were not present in the numerous previous works on high - contrast spectral and dynamic problems .",
