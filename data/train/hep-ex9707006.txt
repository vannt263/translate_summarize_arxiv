    "collisions of 27.5 gev positrons with 820 gev protons at * hera * are studied using the * zeus * detector .",
    "the processes of interest here are those where an almost real photon ( virtually @xmath1 ) is radiated from the positron which then interacts with a parton in the proton to produce two high transverse energy jets .",
    "the hard scale provided by the large transverse momentum allows us to describe these processes using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , and therefore they can be used to test it .",
    "the photon can either interact directly with the parton from the proton ( direct processes ) , or it can first fluctuate into an hadronic state which then acts as source of partons for the hard scatter ( resolved processes ) . in the resolved case ,",
    "in addition to the two jets , there is also a photon remnant . in direct process since all the photon takes part in the interaction @xmath2 , the fraction of the photon momentum entering into the hard scatter , is 1 , and conversely for resolved processes @xmath31 . in order to use this to identify and separate direct and resolved event samples it is necessary to define an experimentally measurable @xmath2 that is valid to all orders .",
    "this is done in terms of the transverse energy @xmath4 and pseudorapidity @xmath5 of the two highest transverse energy jets in an event  @xcite : @xmath6 higher order and hadronisation effects cause the average @xmath7 of direct events to be slightly less than 1 , and the distribution peaks at @xmath80.85 .",
    "a cut at @xmath9 is used to separate the two classes of event .",
    "direct processes are sensitive to high @xmath2 quarks in the photon , and the parton distribution of the proton , whereas resolved process are sensitive to lower @xmath2 parton distributions in the photon .",
    "the results presented here are based on 2.7pb@xmath10 of data taken in the 1994 hera running period , except the prompt photon analysis which uses data coresponding to 5.7pb@xmath10 from 1995 .",
    "all cross sections presented here are corrected back to final state particle level using monte carlo .",
    "the cross section of the hard scatter is factorised into three parts : the parton - parton scattering cross section @xmath11 , the parton densities in the proton @xmath12 , and those of the photon @xmath13 .",
    "the jet cross section at leading order is written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the pseudorapidities of the two outgoing partons .",
    "so by measuring jet cross sections one can test pqcd and gain insight into the parton densities in the proton and photon . at hera we are looking at e - p collisions and",
    "there is a spectrum of incoming photon energies , usually described using the weizscker - williams approximation  @xcite . here",
    "the inclusive jet cross section @xmath17 is presented for cone jets with a radius r=1 in @xmath18 - @xmath19 space , with pseudorapidities @xmath20 , in events with centre of mass energies 134@xmath21 gev .",
    "the measurement is made for cuts on the minimum @xmath4 of 14 , 17 , 21 , and 25 gev .",
    "figure  [ f - inc - xsecs](a ) shows these cross sections compared to expectations from the pythia model .",
    "pythia simulates the matrix element in lo with the inclusion of initial and final state parton showers ( ps ) .",
    "the shape of the cross sections is well described by the model , however the pythia result is @xmath22 lower than the data in all cases .",
    "this is true for both grv - ho and lac1 parameterisations of the photon structure function .",
    "figure  [ f - inc - xsecs](b ) shows the curve for @xmath2317 gev compared to next to leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations by kramer , klasen , and salesch  @xcite , using grv - ho and gs parton distributions for the photon .",
    "the calculated and measured cross sections agree well in magnitude up to @xmath24 1.3 for both photon parton distribution functions . at larger rapidities",
    "the calculations tend to fall below the data .",
    "the dijet cross sections as a function of @xmath25 have been measured in order to study the photon and proton structure .",
    "the requirement @xmath260.5 is made to increase correlation to the parton momenta and ensure a good resolution for the measurement .",
    "the measurement was made with a clustering algorithm ktclus  @xcite , and two types of cone algorithm eucell and pucell(both with a cone radius of 1 ) .",
    "these algorithms differ in their seed finding and cone merging .",
    "figure  [ f - dijet-2](a ) shows the measured cross sections for all three jet finders for minimum @xmath4 cuts of 6 , 8 , 11 , and 15 gev .",
    "the upper four plots are for @xmath27 , and the lower four for @xmath28 . to model the differences in the jet algorithms in nlo calculations an additional parameter , @xmath29 , is introduced  @xcite .",
    "curves for @xmath301 and @xmath302 are also shown in figure  [ f - dijet-2](a ) .",
    "@xmath31 emulates ktclus and @xmath301r ( @xmath32r ) pucell ( eucell ) . at lower @xmath4",
    "the differences between the two calculations and the different jet algorithms are similar .",
    "as the @xmath4 rises the differences between the measurements gradually disappear , however the differences between the calculations remain . for the high @xmath7 cross sections there is good agreement between the measurements and the respective calculation .",
    "the same is true for the low @xmath7 results with @xmath33 gev .",
    "however , when lower energy jets are included the data lie significantly above the calculations .",
    "in it s cms the dijet system is characterised by a scattering angle @xmath34 , the angle between the jets and the beam axis .",
    "the dominant direct photon process is photon - gluon fusion @xmath35 where the exchanged particle is a quark .",
    "this    fermion exchange leads to a @xmath36 angular dependence in the cross section .",
    "in contrast resolved processes are dominated by gluon exchange , which results in an angular dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore low and high @xmath7 samples should have different angular distributions .",
    "figure  [ f - dijet-1](a ) shows the measured @xmath38 for direct and resolved event samples normalised to unity at @xmath39 .",
    "also shown are curves for lo and nlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the resolved sample shows a much steeper rise towards high @xmath40 than the direct sample .",
    "the data and calculations are in excellent agreement .",
    "this confirms that direct ( resolved ) photoproduction is dominated by the exchange of spin-@xmath41 quarks ( spin-1 gluons ) .",
    "the dominant prompt photon processes are @xmath42 and @xmath43 for resolved , and @xmath44 for direct photoproduction .",
    "therefore prompt photon measurements are particularly sensitive to the quark distributions in the proton and photon .",
    "direct processes are expected to dominate overall .",
    "the advantage of the photon in the final state over jets is that it is not subject to hadronisation effects .",
    "events are selected if they contain at least one jet with @xmath454 gev and one prompt photon .",
    "the photons are identified as an electromagnetic cluster in the calorimeter with 5@xmath4610 gev and no track within a radius of 0.3 in @xmath18 - @xmath19 space .",
    "figure  [ f - dijet-1](b ) shows as points the measured @xmath2 distribution for these events .",
    "also shown are histograms for full , and resolved only pythia monte carlo samples .",
    "this plot confirms that the direct processes dominate .",
