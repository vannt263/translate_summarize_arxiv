    "the noise will thus be the smaller the more effectively the charge on the conductor is screened .",
    "the strong dependence on interaction of the properties discussed in this work are another illustration of the importance of screening in the discussion of dynamical effects in mesoscopic samples .",
    "the frequency - dependent noise induced into a nearby gate is a first order effect : it is not a small correction to an effect that exists already in the zero - frequency limit .",
    "this lets us hope that experimental detection of this noise is possible . from our work",
    "it is clear that such experiments would greatly contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of mesoscopic conductors and the role of interactions .    the work of m.  h.  p.  and m.  b.  was supported by the swiss national science foundation . s.  a.  v.  l.  was supported by the `` stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie '' ( fom ) and by the tmr network `` dynamics of nanostructure '' .",
