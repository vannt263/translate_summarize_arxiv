    "the observation of the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal gw150914 by advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) opened up the possibility of using gws as cosmological and astrophysical probes @xcite .",
    "gw150914 is a gw signal from a pair of merging back holes ( bhs ) at @xmath0 , with a mass of each bh of @xmath1 , which were inferred by fitting the observed waveform with numerical relativity waveforms .",
    "the discovery of such a bh - bh merger event implies that bh - bh mergers may be much more ubiquitous than previously thought .",
    "gws from inspiraling compact binaries , which sometimes referred as standard sirens , are potentially a very powerful cosmological probe , because they can determine the absolute distances to the gw sources @xcite .",
    "assuming general relativity , one can obtain information on masses of inspiraling and merging objects from the shape of the waveform , which then determines the absolute strain amplitude of gws emitted from these objects .",
    "thus the comparison of the observed strain amplitude enables a direct measurement of the luminosity distance to the gw source .",
    "indeed , the luminosity distance to gw150914 was estimated to be @xmath2mpc using this technique @xcite . with the redshift information from independent observations of an electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart , one can directly constrain the absolute distance - redshift relation , and hence obtains constraints on cosmological parameters including the hubble constant and dark energy parameters @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear whether em counterparts can really be observed . in the case of gw150914 , while a hard x - ray emission that might possibly be associated with gw150914 was detected with fermi gamma - ray burst monitor @xcite , no confirmed em counterpart is reported .",
    "since mergers of bhs are not expected to have em counterparts , this association of the hard x - ray emission , if real , requires special explanations such as a bh - bh merger in a dense environment ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if a bulk of bh - bh mergers do not have em counterparts , their use as a cosmological probe will be limited .",
    "it has been argued that gws from compact binary mergers would be useful even if em counterparts are not identified .",
    "nishizawa et al .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of exploiting the phase shift @xcite of binary sources to constrain cosmological parameters without em counterparts .",
    "messenger and read @xcite proposed to use tidal effects on merging neutron stars to break the degeneracy to obtain information on the redshift of the system .",
    "another approach is to take advantage of the clustering property of gw sources .",
    "recently , namikawa et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the large - angle auto - correlation of gw sources can provide tight constraints on primordial non - gaussianity .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the cross - correlation between spatial distributions of compact binary gw sources without redshift information and a galaxy sample with known redshifts as a new method to extract cosmological information from gws .",
    "we show that this cross - correlation extracts information on the distance - redshift relation and hence constrains cosmological parameters including the hubble constant that determines the absolute distance scale .",
    "this is made possible because the cross - correlation signal is maximized when luminosity distances of gw sources and redshifts of the galaxy sample matches .",
    "the idea is similar to the cross - correlation of photometric and spectroscopic galaxies to calibrate photometric redshifts of galaxies @xcite .",
    "a complication is that luminosity distances estimated from gws are affected by weak gravitational lensing , which induces additional spatial correlations on the sky ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we explicitly include this effect in our formulation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formulation ] we give our formulation .",
    "we present our result including fisher matrix analysis in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "finally we give our conclusion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "our fiducial cosmological model is based on the latest planck result @xcite and has matter density @xmath3 , dark energy density @xmath4 , baryon density @xmath5 , the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath6 , the spectral index @xmath7 , the normalization of matter fluctuations @xmath8 , and dark energy equation of state @xmath9 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a flat universe .",
    "observations of gws from mergers of compact binaries provide information on luminosity distances @xmath10 to the gw sources . on the other hand , their redshifts are not a direct observable . in this paper , for simplicity , we assume that the observed luminosity distance @xmath11 from the analysis of the waveform is related to the true distance @xmath10 via the log - normal distribution @xmath12\\frac{1}{d_{\\rm obs } } , \\label{eq : dobs}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 the dispersion on @xmath11 is caused by various effects , including the statistical error of gw observations and the degeneracy of the luminosity distance with other parameters such as masses of compact objects and the inclination of the system .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 quantifies the dispersion . considering einstein telescope @xcite like gw observations , in this paper we assume the dispersion of the distance estimate of @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , weak gravitational lensing also affects cosmological distances .",
    "we include the effect of weak gravitational lensing explicitly by relating the distance @xmath10 to the average distance @xmath16 , which represents the standard luminosity distance computed from the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker universe , as @xmath17 , \\label{eq : dis_kappa}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the lensing convergence , which is a function of the sky position @xmath19 and redshift @xmath20 .",
    "the lensing convergence is essentially a projected matter density field , and is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the matter density field , @xmath23 is the hubble parameter , @xmath24 is the ( physical ) critical surface density at redshift @xmath25 for the source redshift @xmath20 , and @xmath26 is a mean physical density of the universe at redshift @xmath20 .",
    "we construct the @xmath27-th angular density field of gw sources by projecting them in the luminosity distance range @xmath28 .",
    "given the log - normal relation between the observed and true distances , the angular number density is computed from the three - dimensional number density field of gw sources @xmath29 as @xmath30 where the comoving angular diameter distance is @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 describes the selection function along the line - of - sight @xmath33 .",

    "the factor @xmath37 in the denominator accounts for the cosmological time dilation effect .",
    "the merger rate @xmath36 has not yet been constrained very well .",
    "the observation of gw150914 implies the bh - bh merger rate of @xmath38 at the local universe @xcite .",
    "several models predict that the bh - bh merger rate increases toward higher redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can also use gws from neutron star mergers for our cross - correlation study , and their rate is estimated to be of similar order .",
    "thus in this paper we assume @xmath39 over all the redshift range of our interest .",
    "the expression of the projected number density @xmath40 allows us to define the projected density field @xmath41 , which plays a central role in our cross - correlation analysis .",

    "( [ eq : zselect_der ] ) implies that the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delgw ] ) is smaller than the first term , but as we will show later , the second term can make dominate contributions to correlation signals , because the convergence contains accumulated information along the line - of - sight .      for simplicity",
    "we assume a linear bias @xmath45 for gw sources .",
    "this assumption is reasonable in the sense that mergers of compact binary objects are expected to be associated with galaxies which are known to trace large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the density field @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delgw ] ) between @xmath27-th and @xmath46-th bins is calculated using the limber s approximation @xcite as @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the matter power spectrum . since we are interested in relatively large angular scales ( @xmath52 ) , the cross spectrum is dominated by the so - called two - halo term ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , which suggests that we can use the linear matter power spectrum for @xmath51 in @xmath53 and @xmath54 . on the other hand , @xmath55 is given by a projection of all matter fluctuations along the line - of - sight which mixes small and large scale fluctuations .",

    "we compute the transfer function of the linear matter power spectrum using the result in @xcite , and the nonlinear matter power spectrum using the result in @xcite .",

    "the correlation among spectroscopic galaxies [ @xmath99 ; see eq .",

    "we define luminosity distance bins of gw sources by the distance width corresponding to @xmath102 , and compute the minimum ( @xmath103 ) and maximum ( @xmath104 ) luminosity distances in each bin using the standard luminosity distance - redshift relation in our fiducial cosmological model .",

    "we consider the multipole range @xmath121 .",
    "the maximum multipole @xmath122 should be determined from the angular resolution of gw observations .",
    "the angular resolution of the einstein telescope network corresponds to approximately @xmath114 @xcite , which we adopt as a fiducial value .",
    "however we also consider an optimistic case @xmath113 in order to check the dependence of our results on @xmath122 .",
    "finally we assume the survey area of @xmath123  deg@xmath124 which is covered by euclid .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows marginalized errors on cosmological parameters for both @xmath114 and @xmath113 .",
    "we find that tight constraints on the hubble constant as well as dark energy parameters can be obtained from the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the summary of constraints given in table  [ table : par ] indicates that a percent level constraint on the hubble constant can be obtained , suggesting that the distance - redshift relation is successfully constrained .",
    "we also note a large improvement of constraints from @xmath114 to @xmath113 , which implies that accurate localizations of gw sources on the sky are crucial for the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the expected accuracy of cosmological parameter estimation depends on several parameters such as the number density of gw sources and their bias factors , which are poorly known . for comparison ,",
    "we consider more pessimistic case with an order of magnitude smaller number density of gw sources , @xmath125 , and repeat the fisher matrix calculation .",
    "we find that the change of the expected constraint on the hubble constant is modest , from @xmath126 to @xmath127 for @xmath114 , and from @xmath128 to @xmath129 for @xmath113 .",
    "this suggests that the cross - correlation technique is still useful even when the gw rate is significantly smaller than our fiducial value .",
    "we note that the expressions of the angular power spectra in this paper have been derived using the limber s approximation which breaks down at small @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "we expect that this approximation is valid for the purpose of this paper , because the cross - correlation signal mainly comes from large @xmath90 , @xmath130 , at which the limber s approximation is expected to be reasonably accurate for our choice of @xmath72 for the spectroscopic galaxy sample . limber s approximation becomes inaccurate for cross - correlation with large redshift differences , but due to relative large shot noise such cross - correlation does not contribute to the result very much .",
    "although there is a long tail of cross - correlation signals toward lower redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , it is essentially the cross - correlation of galaxies and matter at the same redshift and hence the limber s approximation is again accurate .",
    "nevertheless , we caution that the full calculation without the limber s approximation may be required for more accurate predictions of the cross - correlation signals , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "gws from mergers of compact objects such as bhs serve as a useful cosmological probe because they allow us to directly measure absolute distance scales . however , in order to constrain the distance - redshift relation from gw sources we also need redshift information .",
    "while the redshift information may be obtained from observations of em counterparts , it is unclear whether such em counterparts can be reliably identified , especially for bh - bh mergers . in this paper",
    ", we propose to use the cross - correlation of gw sources with spectroscopic galaxies as an alternative means of constraining the distance - redshift relation .",
    "we have explicitly included the effect of weak gravitational lensing on luminosity distance estimates in our formulation . using the fisher matrix formalism",
    ", we have shown that tight constraints on the hubble constant as well as dark energy parameters can be obtained by the cross - correlation of gw sources observed by the einstein telescope and spectroscopic galaxies observed by euclid .",
    "constraints on absolute distance scales at cosmological distances are not directly obtained except a few cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gw standard sirens therefore offer invaluable information on the distance - redshift relation including the absolute distance scale .",
    "our analysis has shown that it is possible to constrain the distance - redshift relation even without identifying em counterparts of gw sources and thus without any redshift information on individual gw sources .",
    "finally we note that there is room for improving constraints on the distance - redshift relation from the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "for instance , while we have restricted our analysis to @xmath131 , gws can be detected out to much higher redshifts in next - generation gw observations .",
    "for those high - redshift gws , we can use high - redshift tracers such as quasars , or we may also be able to galaxies with photometric redshifts for the cross - correlation analysis , if their photometric redshifts are accurate enough .",
    "for example , euclid s near - infrared photometry , when combined with ground - based optical photometry , enables an accurate determination of photometric redshifts easily out to @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "photometric galaxies are much denser and therefore lead to more significant detections of cross - correlation signals , which suggests that cross - correlation of gw sources with galaxies with photometric redshifts has a great potential to enhance the use of the cross - correlation method proposed in this paper . the distance - redshift relation may also be constrained by cross - correlating gw sources with tomographic weak lensing @xcite .",
    "we leave exploring these possibilities for future work .",

    "<S> gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries are known to be an excellent absolute distance indicator , yet it is unclear whether electromagnetic counterparts of these events are securely identified for measuring their redshifts , especially in the case of black hole - black hole mergers such as the one recently observed with the advanced ligo . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to use the cross - correlation between spatial distributions of gravitational wave sources and galaxies with known redshifts as an alternative means of constraining the distance - redshift relation from gravitational waves . in our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we explicitly include the modulation of the distribution of gravitational wave sources due to weak gravitational lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the cross - correlation analysis in next - generation observations will be able to tightly constrain the relation between the absolute distance and the redshift , and therefore constrain the hubble constant as well as dark energy parameters . </S>"
