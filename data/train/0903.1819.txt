    "the energy loss at domain boundary , on the other hand , is estimated to be @xmath44 , since the defect appears typically as an atom pair .",

    ", the inserted atom can be supplied not only from the inner shell but also from the outer area .",
    "@xcite we speculate that another candidate for the source of the atom supply is the wire ends , if they are connected to electrode parts .",
    "in summary , domain boundary formation is explored for helical multishell gold nanowire .",
    "the simulations were carried out for nanowires longer than 10 nm by quantum mechanical molecular dynamics simulation . as results , the shear - like deformation on the ( 001)-type surface area introduces helical domains @xcite and a domain boundary appears , typically with the supply of a defective atom pair from the inner shell , between two domains with the opposite shear directions . the mechanism is explained quantitatively by the analysis of local electronic structure and a general discussion is given by a simple energy scaling theory .",
