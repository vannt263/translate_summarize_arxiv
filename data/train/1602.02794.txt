    "as one of the three clock - synchronization algorithms studied for wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) under unknown delay @xcite , leng and wu proposed the generalization of the maximum - likelihood - like estimator ( mlle ) proposed by noh _ et al_. @xcite . to overcome the drawback of the mlle that it can utilize only the time stamps in the first and the last of @xmath0 message exchanges , they extend the gap @xmath1 between two subtracting time stamps from @xmath2 to a range of @xmath3 $ ] so that the generalized mlle can take into more time stamps in estimating clock skew .    specifically , the time stamps in two - way message exchanges are modeled as ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 1 )  and  ( 2 ) ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the clock offset and clock skew of the child node @xmath7 with respect to the parent node @xmath8 , respectively ; @xmath9 represents the fixed portion of one - way propagation delay , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are its variable portions ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "based on and , they construct new sequences @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and model them as follows ( * ? ? ? * eqs .",
    "( 10 )  and  ( 11 ) ) : @xmath15 for @xmath13 . noting that @xmath16 and @xmath17 because @xmath18 and @xmath19 are i.i.d .",
    "zero - mean gaussian random variables with variance @xmath20 , they obtain the maximum - likelihood estimator ( mle ) for @xmath6 given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 13 ) )",
    "@xmath21    the major problem in the derivation of the mle for @xmath6 given in is that , even though @xmath18 and @xmath19 are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian random variables , the noise components @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not in general : for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26    \\notag \\\\ & = -\\operatorname{e}\\left[x_{\\alpha+m}x_{n}\\right ] -    \\operatorname{e}\\left[x_{m}x_{\\alpha+n}\\right ] \\notag \\\\ & = \\begin{cases }    -\\sigma^{2 } , & \\mbox{if } \\alpha=\\left|m - n\\right| \\\\    0 , & \\mbox{otherwise }      \\end{cases } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and",
    "the same goes for @xmath23 .",
    "note that , if the noise components are independent one another as claimed in @xcite , the expectation in must be zero .",
    "the consequence of is that @xmath1 should be greater than @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 in order to maintain the validity of the derivation of the mle for @xmath6 ( * ? ? ?",

    "for example , let @xmath31 be 1",
    ". then @xmath33 satisfies the said condition . because @xmath29 and @xmath34 @xmath30 belongs to @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig : noise_correlation_effect ] clearly shows the effect of the noise correlation on the mean square error ( mse ) of estimation of clock skew and the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath0 when snr=30 db and @xmath36 . in the figure",

    "zero - mean gaussian random variables with variance @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath1 is greater than @xmath27 , we can see that the results of ge1 closely match with the performance bounds ( i.e. , pb@xmath40 ) because there is no issue of noise correlation ; for example , when @xmath1 is 10 , the results of ge1 match with the performance bounds for @xmath0 up to 20 .",
    "compared to the results for ge1 , the results for ge2 of a fictitious model show that they can attain the performance bounds irrespective of the value of @xmath1 because there is no issue of noise correlation at all .",
    "it is interesting , though , that the results of ge1 for @xmath41 show even better performance than the performance bounds . with the valid range of @xmath1 given by , the selection of the optimal @xmath1 given in eqs .",
