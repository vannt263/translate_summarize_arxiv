    "ground - based cherenkov telescopes discovered tev @xmath0-ray emission from 6 blazars , 4 of which are not egret sources .",
    "the electromagnetic emission of these active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is dominated by a non - thermal continuum with a low - energy synchrotron component and a high - energy inverse compton component ( see coppi ( 1999 ) , sikora & madejski ( 2001 ) , krawczynski ( 2003a ) for recent reviews ) .",
    "the tev sources all belong to the class of bl lac objects , blazars with relatively low luminosity but with spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that peak at extremely high energies .    in the case of tev blazars , the large detection area of cherenkov telescopes of several times 10@xmath2",
    "m@xmath3 makes it possible to assess @xmath0-ray flux variations on time scales of minutes . as the kev x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray emission from these sources",
    "is probably produced by electrons of overlapping energy ranges as synchrotron and inverse compton emission , respectively , observations of rapid flux and spectral variability in both bands complement each other ideally .",
    "the observations can thus be used to constrain and , in principal , even over - constrain models .",
    "more specifically , the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray observations yield a measurement of the jet doppler factor @xmath4 and the jet magnetic field @xmath5 at the jet base",
    ". observations of tev blazars can thus reveal key information about the astrophysics of mass - accretion onto supermassive black holes and the formation of agn jets .",
    "unfortunately , the interpretation of the tev @xmath0-ray data is not unambiguous owing to the highly uncertain extent of extragalactic absorption of tev @xmath0-rays in pair - production processes with photons of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) and the cosmic optical background ( cib ) .",
    "although x - ray and @xmath0-ray observations of tev - blazars might ultimately be used to measure the cib / cob , a considerable number of sources is needed as it is difficult to disentangle source physics and cib / cob absorption for individual sources @xcite .",
    "+ owing to its hard x - ray synchrotron emission and low redshift ( @xmath6 0.047 ) , the bl lac object 1es  1959 + 650 had long been considered a prime - candidate tev @xmath0-ray source ( e.g.  stecker , de jager & salamon 1996 , costamante & ghisellini 2002 ) .",
    "the `` utah seven telescope array '' collaboration reported the detection of tev @xmath0-ray emission from the source with a total statistical significance of 3.9  @xmath7 @xcite . the average flux measured during the 1998 observations was about that from the crab nebula .",
    "motivated by the x - ray properties , the telescope array detection , and a tentative detection of the source by the hegra cherenkov telescopes in 2000 and 2001 , we proposed pre - approved pointed _ rxte _ target of opportunity observations .",

    "the whipple @xcite and hegra @xcite data showed that the @xmath0-ray flux was strongest during the first 20 days of observations with peak fluxes of between 4 and 5 crab units ; subsequently , the flare amplitude decreased slowly .",
    "following mrk 421 ( @xmath6 0.031 ) and mrk 501 ( @xmath6 0.034 ) , 1es  1959 + 650 is now the third tev @xmath0-ray blazar with a high - state flux much stronger than that from the crab nebula , allowing us to measure the @xmath0-ray lightcurve on a time scale of a couple of minutes , and to take energy spectra with good photon statistics on a nightly basis . since the discovery of the first tev blazar mrk 421 in 1992 @xcite , the number of well established blazars has now grown to 6 ( see table [ blazars ] ) .",

    "2000 , krawczynski et al .",
    "2001 ) . for mrk 501",
    "however , detailed time dependent modeling showed that the very simplest ssc models failed to account for the combined broadband x - ray ( bepposax , _ rxte _ ) and tev @xmath0-ray data @xcite . in order to consistently fit the data from several flares , the authors had to introduce a second emission zone , as well as",
    "a poorly justified `` minimum lorentz factor of accelerated electrons '' on the order of @xmath65 10@xmath2 and higher . in this paper",
    "we presented evidence for an `` orphan '' @xmath0-ray flare without x - ray counterpart .",
    "also this finding contradicts the most simple 1-zone ssc models .",
    "there are several ways to explain the orphan flare :    * * multiple - component ssc models : * a high density electron population confined to a small emission volume can account for an orphan @xmath0-ray flare ( see sect .",
    "[ sed ] ) .",
    "`` low duty - cycle '' fast variability has been observed for a number of sources .",
    "a prime example is the detection of a strong x - ray flare from mrk 501 with a doubling time of 6 minutes @xcite .",
    "such observations strongly suggest that indeed small regions with high electron densities produce strong and rapid flares .",
    "alternatively , a second electron population with a low high - energy cutoff might produce an orphan @xmath0-ray flare , as mentioned above .",
    "however , the corresponding ssc model requires fine - tuning of the model parameters . as a third possibility a population of electrons with a very hard energy spectrum might produce the gamma - ray flare while it emits synchrotron radiation at energies above those sampled with the _ rxte_. * * external compton models : * in external compton models , the @xmath0-ray flux originates from inverse compton processes of high - energy electrons with radiation external to the jet . variations of the external photon intensity in the jet frame can cause @xmath0-ray flares without lower - energy counterparts .",
    "such variations could have different origins : the external photon flux , e.g.  from the accretion disk , could be intrinsically variable .",
    "alternatively , the motion of the emission region relative to an external photon reflector could result in a time - variable photon flux in the jet frame @xcite . in external compton models ,",
    "the external photon field is highly anisotropic in the jet frame , owing to the highly relativistic motion of the jet plasma ( @xmath66 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the inverse compton emission has a narrower beaming angle than the synchrotron emission and a slight precession of the jet could cause a large change in the tev flux accompanied by a small change of the x - ray flux . *",
    "* magnetic field aligned along jet axis : * if the magnetic field in the emission region of the orphan flare is aligned with the jet axis and thus with the line of sight , the observer would not see the synchrotron flare .",
    "the electrons however would scatter ssc gamma - rays into our direction and we would thus be able to see the inverse compton flare . * * proton models : * in proton models the low - energy radiation is produced by a population of non - thermal electrons and high - energy radiation by accelerated protons , either directly as synchrotron radiation @xcite , or via a proton induced cascade ( pic ) @xcite . as electron and",
    "proton injection rates and high - energy cutoffs may vary in a different way with the plasma conditions , proton models naturally account for orphan flares . in pic models ,",
    "the tev @xmath0-ray emission originates from a thin surface layer of an optically thick pair plasma , while the x - ray emission originates from the full emission volume .",
    "the model naturally accounts for orphan @xmath0-ray flares , as the thin surface layer can produce more rapid flares than the larger x - ray emission region .",
    "we consider it unlikely that this latter explanation applies to the observation of the orphan flare from 1es  1959 + 650 , as the x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes varied on comparable time scales throughout the rest of the observation campaign .",
    "the black hole mass estimates from stellar velocity dispersion measurements allow us to study the connection between the jet emission parameters and the central black hole mass .",
    "we expect to find correlations as the characteristic length and time scales of the accretion system scale with @xmath64 ( see e.g. , mirabel et al .",
    "our data however , did not reveal any correlations .",
    "it is remarkable that 1es  1959 + 650 and mrk  501 show very similar x - ray and @xmath0-ray energy spectra and flux variation time scales while their black hole masses differ by about one order of magnitude .",
    "variations of parameters like jet viewing angle , jet magnetic field , or intensity and energy spectrum of the ambient photon field may mask the correlations .",
    "furthermore , our correlation plots suffer from the limitations of the observations : flux threshold selection effects , limited energy coverage of the observations , and short time over which the data were acquired ( relative to the lifetime of the jet ) .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath64@xmath58 and @xmath64@xmath60 correlations found for nearby galaxies may not hold for blazars , rendering the black hole mass estimates used in our analysis inaccurate ( barth et al .",

    "<S> observations with the x - ray telescope _ rxte _ _ ( rossi x - ray timing explorer ) _ and the whipple and hegra _ ( high energy gamma ray astronomy ) _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-ray telescopes revealed several strong flares , enabling us to sensitively test the x - ray/@xmath0-ray flux correlation properties . </S>",
    "<S> although the x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes seemed to be correlated in general , we found an `` orphan '' @xmath0-ray flare that was not accompanied by an x - ray flare . while we detected optical flux variability with the boltwood and abastumani observatories </S>",
    "<S> , the data did not give evidence for a correlation between the optical flux variability with the observed x - ray and @xmath0-ray flares . </S>",
    "<S> within statistical errors of about 0.03 jy at 14.5 ghz and 0.05  jy at 4.8 ghz , the radio fluxes measured with the university of michigan radio astrophysical observatory ( umrao ) stayed constant throughout the campaign ; the mean values agreed well with the values measured on may 7 and june 7 , 2002 at 4.9 ghz and 15 ghz with the very large array ( vla ) , and , at 4.8 ghz with archival flux measurements . after describing in detail the radio , optical , x - ray and @xmath0-ray light curves and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) we present initial modeling of the sed with a simple synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model . with the addition of another tev blazar with good broadband data </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the set of all tev blazars to begin to look for a connection of the jet properties to the properties of the central accreting black hole thought to drive the jet . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the temporal and spectral x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission characteristics of tev blazars are very similar , even though the masses estimates of their central black holes differ by up to one order of magnitude . </S>"
