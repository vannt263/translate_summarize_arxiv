    "thermodynamic properties of black holes have been studied for many years , especially in anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime due to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "an outstanding feature for ads black holes is the so - called hawking - page phase transition , which can happen between stable large black holes and thermal gas in ads spacetime @xcite .",
    "thermodynamics of charged black holes in ads spacetime has also been intensively studied .",
    "the asymptotically ads charged black holes admit a gauge duality description via a dual thermal field theory .",
    "this dual description suggests that charged ads black holes exhibit critical behavior in the @xmath2 diagram which is reminiscent to the liquid - gas phase transitions in a van der waals system @xcite , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the electric charge and potential , respectively .",
    "recently , this picture has been substantially extended .",
    "the idea of including the variation of the cosmological constant @xmath5 in the first law of black hole thermodynamics has acquired increasing attention @xcite . by studying critical behaviors of ads black holes in the extended phase space , i.e. the @xmath6 diagram @xcite , where @xmath7 is the thermodynamic pressure associated with the cosmological constant , which takes the value @xmath8 in the geometric units @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the @xmath11-dimensional ads radius , @xmath12 is the conjugate ",
    "thermodynamic volume \" @xcite , the analogy in the @xmath2 diagram of ads charged black hole as a van der waals system has been further enhanced .",
    "both systems share the same critical exponents and have extremely similar phase diagrams .",
    "this analogy has been generalized to the higher dimensional charged black holes @xcite , rotating black holes @xcite , gauss - bonnet ( gb ) black holes @xcite , @xmath13 black hole@xcite , black holes with scalar hair@xcite , black holes with nonlinear source@xcite , and born - infeld black holes @xcite in ads space .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath6 variables in the thermodynamics of ads black holes is not just an artificial game to play with .",
    "there exist several reasons why @xmath5 should be included as a thermodynamical variable @xcite .",
    "one may suppose that there are some more fundamental theory in which some physical constants such as yukawa and gauge coupling constants , newton s constant , or cosmological constant , may not be fixed values but dynamical ones arising from the vacuum expectation values and hence can vary .",
    "thus , it is natural to add variations of these `` constants '' into the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xcite . besides , the cosmological constant term is necessary in the first law of black hole thermodynamics , in order to get a consistent smarr relation for balck hole thermodynamics from the scaling argument @xcite",
    "similar situation appears for the born - infeld black holes @xcite and gb black holes @xcite . to get a consistent smarr relation by scaling arguments",
    ", one has to introduce the born - infeld and gb parameter terms into the first law of black holes .",
    "once one takes the cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure in the first law , the black hole mass @xmath14 should be explained as enthalpy rather than internal energy of the system @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will revisit the first law of thermodynamics for gb black holes with emphasis on the role of gb coupling @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that gb gravity theory has two ads solutions with effective cosmological constants @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 corresponds to the general relativistic ( gr ) branch and has a gr limit as @xmath19 , while @xmath20 corresponds to the gb branch and does not have the gr limit .",
    "it has been shown by boulware and deser that the gb branch is unstable and the graviton is a ghost , while the gr branch is stable and is free of ghosts @xcite . thus we shall only consider the gr branch with @xmath18 . by a simple analogy with the previously mentioned @xmath6 criticality for ads black holes , one may tend to consider @xmath21 as a thermodynamic pressure .",
    "however , for two reasons , we will not take this point of view .",
    "firstly , @xmath22 is a complicated combination of _ two _ parameters @xmath5 and @xmath15 and we wish to understand the role of each parameter _",
    "independently_. secondly , in the enthalpy description of the first law , @xmath23 always appear in differential form , i.e. in the term @xmath24 , and it is reasonable to decompose @xmath25 as a combination of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , thanks to from ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have a good reason to consider @xmath28 instead of @xmath15 as a component of thermodynamic pressure , because it is @xmath29 which scales like a pressure .",
    "this is where our considerations depart from the previous work @xcite , which took @xmath15 and its conjugate @xmath30 as a pair of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "this consideration is also different from the geometric formulation for lovelock theories @xcite which contain gauss - bonnet gravity as a special case .",
    "nonetheless , it will become clear that using @xmath0 and its conjugate as a pair of thermodynamic variables indeed reveals novel criticalties of the theory which is otherwise difficult to describe in terms of @xmath15-@xmath30 variables .",
    "we will consider the criticality associated with the new thermodynamic variables @xmath0 and its conjugate @xmath31 in the extended phase space of charged gb - ads black holes .",
    "it will be shown that this kind of critical behavior is different from the previously mentioned @xmath6 criticality , and that the spacial curvature of the ads black hole horizon plays an important role in such criticalities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the thermodynamics of gb - ads black holes in the extended phase space with @xmath0 and @xmath31 . in section 3",
    ", we consider the criticality associated with @xmath0 for static neutral gb - ads black holes .",
    "the case for static charged gb - ads black holes is discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "the action of @xmath11-dimensional einstein - gb - maxwell theory with a bare cosmological constant @xmath5 reads @xmath32",
    "-\\frac{1}{4}\\int \\mathrm{d}^dx \\sqrt{-g } f_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the gb coupling @xmath15 has dimension @xmath33 ^ 2 $ ] and can be identified with the inverse string tension with positive value @xcite if the theory is incorporated in string theory , thus we shall consider only the case @xmath34 .",
    "of course , we take the spacetime dimension @xmath35 , since in @xmath36 dimensions , the integration of the gb density @xmath37 is a topological number and has no dynamics .",
    "the @xmath11-dimensional static charged gb - ads black hole solution arising from the field equations associated with the action ( [ action ] ) is known to take the form @xmath38 which should be accompanied by a standard coulomb potential for the maxwell field , where @xmath39 represents the line element of a @xmath40-dimensional maximally symmetric einstein space with constant curvature @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to the spherical , ricci flat and hyperbolic topology of the black hole horizons , respectively .",
    "the metric function @xmath45 is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath14 and @xmath3 are the mass and charge ( in geometric unit ) of the black hole , respectively .",
    "since we are going to discuss the thermodynamics of the black hole in the extended phase space by introducing extra thermodynamical variables @xmath6 and @xmath47 , the black hole mass @xmath14 should be identified with the enthalpy @xmath48 rather than the internal energy of the gravitational system @xcite .",
    "it follows from ( [ f(r ) ] ) that @xmath49 can be expressed in terms of the horizon radius @xmath50 @xmath51 , \\label{enthalpy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the largest root of @xmath45 .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole is given by @xmath52 other thermodynamic quantities are well known in the literature @xcite . for examples ,",
    "the entropy @xmath53 and electric potential @xmath54 are given by @xmath55 note that here we have treated the cosmological constant and gb coupling constant as free thermodynamical variables , their conjugate quantity thermodynamic volumes @xmath12 and @xmath31 are given respectively by @xmath56 note that these thermodynamic volumes are in no way linked to the geometric volume of the black hole : in fact , from the point of view of static observers located outside of the black hole , there is no such notion of a geometric volume of the black hole at all .",
    "the physical meaning of these thermodynamic volumes remains obscure .",
    "therefore , the negative value of @xmath31 should not be considered unacceptable .",
    "anyway , the negativity of @xmath31 does not prevent us from studying criticality in the extended thermodynamic phase space , since in the following we shall take @xmath50  which is always positive  instead of @xmath31 as an equation of state ( eos ) parameter associated with @xmath0 .",
    "an important relation in black hole thermodynamics is smarr relation . in order to obtain the correct smarr relation for the above - mentioned charged static gb- ads black hole",
    ", we will now make some scaling arguments . since the black hole enthalpy @xmath49 ( i.e. the mass @xmath14 ) is a homogeneous function of entropy @xmath53 , electric charge @xmath3 and thermodynamic pressures @xmath7 and @xmath0 , and that @xmath14 scales as @xmath57^{d-3}$ ] , @xmath53 scales as @xmath57^{d-2}$ ] , @xmath3 scales as @xmath57^{d-3}$ ] , @xmath7 and @xmath0 scales as @xmath57^{-2}$ ] ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , we find that the smarr relation for the black hole under consideration reads @xmath58 this is certainly different from the smarr relation known from previous literature , because we have now extended the thermodynamic phase space and have taken @xmath0 and @xmath31 as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables .",
    "correspondingly , the first law of black hole thermodynamics is generalized as @xmath59    in the rest of this paper , we shall consider criticality associated with the new variable @xmath0 , taking @xmath7 and @xmath3 as fixed parameters . in order to study the criticality of black holes ,",
    "it is necessary to work with the gibbs free energy @xmath60 , which can be obtained via the legendre transformation @xmath61 we shall also make use of the internal energy @xmath62 while evaluating the heat capacity at fixed @xmath50 , where @xmath0 is to be taken as a function of the temperature @xmath63 , thanks to the eos @xmath64 } \\label{pgb2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which arises from ( [ temperature ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath65 , @xmath0 is identically zero , thus @xmath0 and @xmath31 loses their role as a pair of thermodynamic variables .",
    "so , in this paper , we shall always assume @xmath66 .",
    "this eos is quite different from the van der waals equation @xmath67 which states that the pressure @xmath7 is a linear function of the temperature @xmath63 , if the specific volume @xmath68 is kept fixed .",
    "nonetheless , the usual method for studying criticalities for van der waals system still works , as will be seen below .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us note that there are some natural constraints on the allowed range of @xmath0 : firstly , a well - defined vacuum solution with @xmath69 results in @xcite @xmath70 ( i.e. the dimensionless pressure @xmath71 has a lower bound : @xmath72 ) ; secondly , the non - negative definiteness of the black hole entropy ( [ entropy ] ) gives another constraint @xcite",
    "@xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "for simplicity , we begin our study on the case of neutral black holes . the black hole enthalpy ( [ enthalpy ] ) is reduced to @xmath75 and the gibbs free energy becomes @xmath76 the eos of the black holes simplifies into @xmath77    the critical point is determined as the inflection point on the @xmath78 diagram , i.e. , @xmath79 and @xmath80 and @xmath81 should have different signs , where we have used the subscript @xmath82 to stand for the quantities at the critical point . using ( [ pgb1 ] ) ,",
    "the two conditions in ( [ critialpont ] ) becomes a pair of very complicated algebraic equations for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which , of course , depend on the spacetime dimension @xmath11 and the signature of the spacial curvature @xmath85 of the black hole horizons . for @xmath74 , the pair of equations arising from ( [ critialpont ] ) can never have a solution with real and positive @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , we are left with only the choice @xmath86 . in this case , eliminating @xmath84 from the above pair of equations , we get a single simplified equation determining the critical radius @xmath83 , @xmath87 where we have introduced @xmath88 the solutions to this equation read @xmath89 in order to find a real positive @xmath90 , we need to take @xmath91 or @xmath92 . for @xmath91 , only the @xmath93 branch of the solution is allowed , and we can check that around the corresponding solution @xmath83 , @xmath94 indeed changes signature , thus the solution is indeed a critical point . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the two branches of solutions ( [ rc ] ) degenerate , and @xmath94 does not change its signature around the corresponding @xmath83 , so we conclude that there is no critical point in six dimensions .      in five dimensions , we have @xmath95 from which we can easily find @xmath96 this relation is universal in the sense that it is independent of all parameters .",
    "this result is very similar to the one in the van der waals system , which has @xmath97 .",
    "this makes it more conceivable to use the horizon radius @xmath50 instead of the thermodynamic volume @xmath31 as an eos parameter , since @xmath31 does not lead to such a parameter independent relation . since we are taking @xmath7",
    "( i.e. @xmath10 via ) as a constant parameter , it is better to work in units of @xmath7 or @xmath10 and re - express the critical parameters in dimensionless form , @xmath98 in five dimensions , the previously mentioned lower bound for the dimensionless pressure is @xmath99 , and the above critical value is well above this lower bound .",
    "so , the criticality can be always found in this case .",

    ", the system at @xmath105 is in thermal equilibrium between the stable small black hole and large black hole phases , because the unstable , medium sized black hole phase can not physically exist .",
    "the true isotherm for such cases should be replaced by a steeply descending segment and a slowly descending segment joined by a straight , horizontal ( i.e. an isobar @xmath108 ) segment which can be determined by maxwell s equal area law .",
    "when the critical temperature @xmath84 is reached , the shape of the isotherm will undergo significant change .",
    "the two extrema merge into a single inflection point , and we can no longer distinguish between the stable small and large black holes .",
    "the isotherms with @xmath109 no longer contain any extrema and there is only one branch with positive compression coefficient corresponding to thermally stable black holes .",
    "turning to the gibbs free energy plots , we see that each of the curves corresponding to @xmath110 can extend to @xmath105 and contains a  swallow tail \" segment , which is a typical feature in first order phase transitions . from @xmath111 and downwards ,",

    "this means that at each temperature , the value of @xmath0 has an upper bound , black holes with @xmath0 bigger than the upper bound simply could not exist . for smaller values of @xmath0 , there are two different black holes at each temperature : a small unstable black hole and a large stable black hole .",

    ", we will study the scaling behaviors of some physical quantities near the criticality and compute the corresponding critical exponents in five dimensions .",
    "the construction is analogous to the scaling behavior of van de waals liquid - gas system , so we begin by reviewing the scaling laws for van de waals system . near the critical point , the critical behavior of a van der waals liquid - gas system can be characterized by the following critical exponents @xcite : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the the heat capacity at constant volume , @xmath118 is the isothermal compressibility , subscripts @xmath119 and @xmath120 stand for quantities in the gaseous and liquid phases , respectively .",

    "the liquid and gaseous phases for the van der waals system should also be replaced by the small and large black hole phases , respectively .",
    "since we shall be interested in properties near the criticality , we introduce the following dimensionless parameters which tend to zero near the critical point , @xmath122 using these new parameters and inserting the critical values ( [ crtv ] ) into the eos ( [ pgb1 ] ) at @xmath123 , we get the following _ dimensionless _ eos , @xmath124 the taylor series expansion for ( [ dless ] ) at the critical point gives @xmath125 where we have neglected terms of order @xmath126 and @xmath127 or higher as did in @xcite .",

    ", we obtain the following equation @xmath130 where the subscripts @xmath131 and @xmath120 stand for small and large stable black hole phases , respectively . on the other hand , the physical phase equilibrium condition ( i.e. the isobar pressure condition ) gives @xmath132 ( [ eqv1 ] ) and ( [ eqv2 ] ) together give a unique non - trivial solution ( @xmath133 ) @xmath134 we conclude that the coexistence of small and large black hole phases requires @xmath135 . in other words , only when @xmath105 can the two stable black hole phases exist at the same pressure .",
    "this is different from that of a van der waals liquid - gas system where @xmath109 is required for a phase equilibrium .",
    "( [ phase ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath136 this scaling behavior is in analogy to ( [ beta ] ) , which gives us the critical exponent @xmath137 .    the isothermal _ radial _ compressibility can be calculated as follows .",

    "this completes the proof that the critical exponents are kept unchanged even in the presence of electric charge in five dimensions .",
    "the critical behavior in @xmath1 dimensions is more difficult to analyze , not only because of more complicated eos , but also because that the conditions ( [ critialpont ] ) for the critical points become a much more complicated set of algebraic equations , making it harder to solve analytically .",
    "to understand such criticality , we shall proceed in two different ways : for generic spacetime dimension @xmath1 , we shall take some particular choice for the electric charge @xmath3 , which allows us to obtain the critical point parameters analytically . on the other hand , in six dimensions , we shall study the isotherms and @xmath100 curves numerically , taking @xmath86 and @xmath178 at arbitrary constant @xmath10 .",
    "this allows us to understand the phase structure in this particular dimension .      in generic dimensions @xmath1 ,",
    "the critical point conditions ( [ critialpont ] ) become a set of very complicated algebraic equations in @xmath84 and @xmath83 . to gain some insights into the solutions , we take the following particular choice for the electric charge @xmath3 , @xmath179 or , in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath180 , @xmath181 where @xmath182 is a dimensionless parameter because @xmath3 has the dimension @xmath57^{d-3}$ ] .    with the aid of the computer algebra system _ maple _",
    ", we can eliminate @xmath84 from the pair of equations that follow from ( [ critialpont ] ) , which yield a single algebraic equation for @xmath90 , @xmath183 the particular choice ( [ qrho ] ) for the electric charge makes the resulting equation ( [ eqcri ] ) of second order in @xmath90 , which is exactly solvable .",
    "the corresponding @xmath84 given by @xmath184 where @xmath185 for @xmath1 , there can be up to two different critical points of critical radius @xmath186 for a given @xmath182 with appropriate value .",
    "however , please bear in mind that these two critical points do not correspond to the same electric charge , because the charge @xmath3 and @xmath90 are related via ( [ qrho ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the expression ( [ tcd ] ) for @xmath84 , there is a factor @xmath187 , which implies that both solutions to ( [ eqcri ] ) correspond to @xmath188 when @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , the five dimensional critical point with @xmath189 described in the previous subsection does not correspond to any of the solutions of ( [ eqcri ] ) with @xmath91 .    the explicit solutions to ( [ eqcri ] ) read @xmath190,\\\\ \\delta & = 3\\ , \\left ( 2\\,d-7 \\right ) ^{2}{\\varrho } ^{2}+8\\,k \\left ( 2\\,d-1   \\right )   \\left ( d-4 \\right ) \\varrho -16\\,{k}^{2 } \\left ( d-2 \\right )   \\left ( d-6 \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can check that for @xmath1 , @xmath94 changes signature around both solutions @xmath191 ,",

    "please note that the real positivity of @xmath192 and the corresponding @xmath193 and @xmath194 naturally imposes some bounds on @xmath182 , so the two critical points will appear only for electric charges within some specific region , just like in the previously studied five dimensional case .      to analyze the critical points at fixed charge @xmath3 rather than fixed @xmath182",
    ", we now work numerically in the case @xmath92 .",
    "assuming that the ads radius @xmath10 is fixed and writing @xmath195 where both @xmath196 and @xmath197 are dimensionless , the critical point conditions can be reduced into the following equation for the critical radius parameter @xmath197 ,",
