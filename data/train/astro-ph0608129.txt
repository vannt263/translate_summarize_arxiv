    "the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ; @xcite ) has measured the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy and polarization with high resolution and sensitivity , and opened a new window to precision cosmology .",
    "the wmap one - year data imply that the observed cmb fluctuations are consistent with predictions of the concordance @xmath14 model with scale - invariant adiabatic fluctuations generated during the inflationary epoch @xcite .",
    "the recent release of the wmap three - year data has confirmed the primary results from the one - year data , giving more accurate determination of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "however , some peculiar aspects of the cmb maps have been noticed , leading to many controversies .",
    "first , there have been many reports of detection of non - gaussian signatures ( @xcite ) , as opposed to the wmap team s result @xcite . in particular , the origin of the asymmetry in statistical properties of the cmb between the galactic northern and southern hemispheres ( @xcite ) has not been fully explained . @xcite",
    "have studied the effects of the map - making algorithm on the observed asymmetry in cmb temperatures between the galactic northern and southern hemispheres in the wmap data .",
    "another interesting issue is the low cmb quadrupole power .",
    "cut - sky analysis of wmap three - year data gives a quadrupole power of @xmath15 , which is quite a bit lower than the expected value in the best - fit @xmath14 model ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) . through subsequent analyses of the wmap data ,",
    "such a low quadrupole power has been confirmed and the effect of the residual foreground emission on the statistical properties of cmb has been extensively studied ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the alignment and planarity of @xmath1 and @xmath16 modes on the sky are also interesting features that have been seen in the wmap data @xcite .",
    "although each of the anomalies in the cmb anisotropy may have its own cosmological origin , there is a possibility that the residual galactic foreground emission has affected the nature of the observed temperature fluctuations . therefore , foreground subtraction is very important as a starting point of all cmb - related analyses .",
    "the most popular method of foreground removal is to model the galactic emission as the weighted sum of foreground templates such as synchrotron , free - free , and dust emission maps ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another method of foreground removal is the internal linear combination ( ilc ) method using multi - frequency data @xcite .",
    "the wmap team has created the ilc map ( hereafter wilc1yr ) by computing a weighted combination of the wmap maps that have been band averaged within each of the five wmap frequency bands , all smoothed to @xmath17 resolution @xcite .",
    "the weights are determined by minimizing the variance of temperatures in the combined map , with a constraint that the sum of the weights is one .",
    "they have defined twelve disjoint regions on the sky , within which weights are determined independently . except for the biggest kp2 region ,",
    "the other 11 regions are defined by subdividing the inner galactic plane with lines of constant galactic longitudes",
    ". however , the combination weights found by the wmap team do not give the minimum variance , and their method of ` non - linear searching ' for the set of weights has not been described .",
    "@xcite have improved the wmap team s ilc method by applying a lagrange multiplier to produce a variance - minimized ilc map ( hereafter lilc ) .",
    "they use the same 12 disjoint regions and the smoothing scheme to remove discontinuous boundaries as used in @xcite .",
    "@xcite has emphasized that the effects of noise on the performance of the ilc method is very important .",
    "if noise is high , the ilc method finds the best combination weights that minimize the instrumental noise rather than foregrounds .",
    "@xcite have applied a variant of the ilc method to make a foreground - cleaned cmb map ( hereafter tcm ) with high resolution . by noticing that the galactic foregrounds appear dominantly on larger angular scales while the instrument noise dominates only at smaller scales ,",
    "they have applied linear combinations in harmonic space to remove foreground emission at different angular scales separately .",
    "based on levels of the galactic foreground intensity , @xcite have defined nine disjoint regions , where foreground removal has been done independently .",
    "recently , @xcite have made a new foreground - cleaned cmb map ( hereafter tcm3yr ) by applying the same technique to the wmap three - year data .    in the three - year data analysis ,",
    "the wmap team has made a new ilc map ( hereafter wilc3yr ) by combining the wmap data at five different bands @xcite .",
    "from the one - year version of region definition map , they have eliminated the taurus a region that is too small to give a reliable foreground removal while they have added a new region to minimize the dust residuals in the galactic plane ( denoted as region 1 in fig . [ fig : wilc12]@xmath18 ) .",
    "they have used the lagrange multiplier method as used in @xcite to determine the ilc coefficients . to quantify the bias due to the residual foreground emissions , they have performed one hundred monte carlo simulations using the one - year galaxy model based on the maximum entropy method ( mem ) .",
    "the three - year ilc map , wilc3yr , has been produced by subtracting this bias prediction .",
    "all ilc methods require several disjoint regions that contain map pixels with similar properties .",
    "otherwise , the efficiency of the ilc method becomes very low , leaving significant residual foregrounds .",
    "the galactic foreground emission appears as the sum of the individual emissions with different physical natures , and its spectral behavior varies over a wide range of frequencies and over the whole sky .",
    "the disjoint regions defined by the wmap team and @xcite do not fully reflect the galactic foreground properties .    in this paper , we derive a new foreground - reduced cmb map by applying the minimum - variance ilc method including information about the foreground spectral properties .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in @xmath19 , we describe our simple minimum - variance ilc method , and present a new definition of sky regions for ilc . in @xmath20 ,",
    "we derive a new foreground - cleaned cmb map from the wmap three - year data . measurements of statistics that are related to the quadrupole and the octopole are given in @xmath21 .",
    "we discuss our results in @xmath22 .    throughout this paper , the power spectrum",
    "is calculated by @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the spherical harmonic coefficients in the galactic coordinate system .",
    "we find an optimal weight set for linear combination of observed cmb maps to remove the galactic foregrounds with the constraint that the combined map have the minimum variance .",
    "let us denote the observed temperature at @xmath26-th pixel and at @xmath27-th frequency band by @xmath28 .",
    "the observed temperature is a sum of the cmb temperature , instrument noise , and the galactic emission .",
    "we perform ilc on a region @xmath29 by minimizing the variance of the weighted sum of observed temperatures at pixels within the region .",
    "for multi - frequency cmb data with @xmath30 bands , the temperature of @xmath26-th pixel of the linearly combined map can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "the efficiency of foreground reduction by the linear combination method becomes highest when the region contains pixels with the same foreground spectral variation over frequencies . on the other hand ,",
    "if a region contains a large number of pixels whose galactic foreground spectral property varies dramatically over the sky , as is the region @xmath50 of wilc3yr ( see fig . [",
    "fig : wilc12]@xmath18 ) , the ilc just tries to find the best - fit combination weights that is optimal only to the average foreground spectral behavior .",
    "the ilc then results in positive or negative residual bias in the map ( @xmath51 ) .    to assess the galactic foreground properties",
    ", we use the mem galactic foreground maps derived by the wmap team , which are shown in figure [ fig : memg ] .",
    "the wmap team has tried to distinguish different emission sources from one another by applying the mem to the wmap data , where the prior spatial distribution and spectral behavior of foreground components have been assumed by using the galactic template maps . from this information",
    "the team has produced synchrotron , free - free , and dust emission maps with @xmath17 resolution at each wmap frequency .",
    "for each band , we co - add three emission maps to make a galaxy foreground map , upgrade its resolution to @xmath52 , and further smooth the map with a gaussian filter with variable widths ( @xmath53  @xmath54 ) to reduce the mem reconstruction noise .",

    "we have defined a new group index map composed of four hundred pixel - groups that contain pixels with similar foreground spectral properties , and obtained a cmb map with foreground emission effectively reduced ( silc400 ) .",
    "two hundred ilc simulations show that the residual foreground emission in the silc400 is very small in amplitude , which is at @xmath204@xmath205 levels at high galactic latitude regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resilc]@xmath18 ) . on high latitude regions where the foreground emission is very weak at high frequency bands ( v and w ) ,",

    "we have smoothed the foreground maps with a gaussian filter whose width varies depending on the signal - to - noise level of intensities in the mem galaxy maps .    such residual foreground features do not affect significantly the statistics of large - scale modes of cmb anisotropy .",

    "our estimate is consistent with that of wilc3yr , and is located between those measured from the tcm3yr and lilc .",

    "the observed angular separation is marginally statistically significant .",
    "as observed in figure [ fig : plot_pscompare ] , the power spectra of the cmb and the galactic emission maps show zigzag patterns at @xmath1@xmath13 , with the zigzag directions opposite to each other , which strongly implies that the large scale cmb signal estimated from silc400 and other analyses may be contaminated by the galactic foreground emission and is anti - correlated with the galactic signal ( see also tables [ tab : galfore ] and [ tab : alm_silc400 ] ) .",

    "we have calculated the cross - correlation functions between the 200 true input cmb signal maps and the galactic emission map .",

    "the large scale modes of silc400 on the southern hemisphere also shows anti - correlation with the galactic emission even at @xmath369 .",
    "however , whether such anti - correlation occurs due to the residual galactic emission or by chance is not clear and further investigation is needed .    in this study , to measure the spectral indices of the foreground , we have used the mem - derived galactic foreground maps that contain some level of reconstruction errors and fail to model the galaxy on the galactic plane region . for the best reconstruction of cmb anisotropy through the ilc method ,",
