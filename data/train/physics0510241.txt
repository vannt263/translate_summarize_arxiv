    "the study of electron emission spectra in ion atom collisions has been a field of intense activity for years ( stolterfoht _ et al _ 1997 ) . for",
    "intermediate to high energy single ionization there has been considerable theoretical efforts focused in the so - called two centre electron emission ( tcee ) ( fainstein _ et al _ 1991 , pedersen _ et al _ 1990 ) .",
    "improvement in the description of the ionized electron moving in the presence of both residual target and projectile fields after the collision ( final state ) has been key for the correct description of experimental data ( gulys _ et al _ 1995 ) .    within distorted wave approximations",
    ", it has been shown that , at least for high impact energy and multiply charged projectiles , cdw theory of belki ( 1978 ) used together with an appropriate description of the initial bound and final continuum electron states , yields best results for doubly differential cross sections ( ddcss ) ( gulys and fainstein 1998 , ciappina _ et al _ 2003 ) . however , when the projectile impact velocity decreases , the cdw ",
    "eis theory of crothers & mccann ( 1983 ) gives better results , its only difference being the choice of the initial state .",
    "moreover cdw  eis approximation is formally free of criticisms regarding the initial state proper normalization , and the transition amplitudes have not the divergent behavior that cdw exhibits ( crothers 1982 ) ( although it has been demonstrated that cdw amplitudes are integrable and its ddcss are well behaved ) ( dub and dewangan 1995 ) .",
    "the field has experienced a renewed interest as a result of the development of the experimental technique known as coltrims ( cold - target recoil - ion momentum spectroscopy ) ( moshammer _ et al _ 1994 ) . with coltrims",
    ", the projectile s tiny scattering angle can be obtained indirectly by measuring the ionized electron and recoil ion momenta .",
    "fully differential cross sections ( fdcs ) for ion impact ionization can be measured now and this constitute a challenging ground for existing theories ( foster _ et al _ 2004 ) .",
    "the first measurements of the fdcs , for various momentum transfers and ejected - electron energies , were reported in 2001 by schulz _",
    "et al _ for single ionization of helium by 100 mev amu@xmath1 c@xmath0 .",
    "theoretical results for this process were made later by madison _",
    "et al _ 2002 , using several approximation schemes .",
    "they obtained reasonable good agreement between experiment and theory in the scattering plane for intermediate momentum transfer , but the theories used was not able to reproduce the measurements for large values of momentum transfer and out of scattering plane .",
    "subsequently , experiments with other projectiles and energy ranges have been performed .",
    "et al _ ( 2003 ) have reported absolute experimental measurements for 2 mev amu@xmath1 c@xmath0 single ionization of helium in the scattering plane for various momentum transfers and ejected - electron energies .",
    "et al _ ( 2004 ) have presented 3dw ",
    "eis results for the single ionization of helium by 3.6 mev amu@xmath1 au@xmath2 and au@xmath3 ions .",
    "the 3dw  eis model is a modified version of the cdw ",
    "eis approximation and , although the authors found good agreement with 2 mev amu@xmath1 c@xmath0 data , the theory did not yield a significant improvement for higher charged ions .",
    "theoretical results calculated using a cdw  eis model exhibited differences between experiment and theory on an absolute scale for emission in the scattering plane , defined by the plane containing the initial and final projectile momenta .",
    "their calculations were made using a post version of the cdw  eis theory and an active electron approximation with hydrogenic wavefunctions for the initial and final electron states .",
    "indeed , the simplest description for the he bound initial state is to assume it has one ` active ' and one ` passive ' electron and that the ` active ' electron can be described as moving in the effective coulomb field of the atomic core with an effective charge chosen either : ( a ) to reproduce the ionization energy or ( b ) so that the continuum wave is orthogonal to the initial state .",
    "a more sophisticated description involves the use of full numerical hartree ",
    "fock wave functions for both initial and final states of the active electron ( gulys _ et al _ 1995 , gulys and fainstein 1998 , foster _",
    "et al _ 2004 ) .",
    "fock description , however , does not include proper angular correlations in the initial state , and for large perturbations , there might be the chance that the projectile interacts with more than one electron in a single event . an explicit two - electron description ,",
    "i.e. , a full - blown four - body theory for the collision process might be necessary in that case .",
    "we have shown that by using the prior version of cdw  eis together with an appropriate roothan ",
    "fock description of the initial state and an effective charge coulomb wave function for the target - electron continuum , we get similar results to those obtained by using numerical hartree ",
    "fock wave functions ( ciappina _ et al _ 2004 ) , for ion impact helium ionization ddcss .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present post and prior cdw  eis calculations with internuclear interaction between the projectile and the target ( n  n interaction ) taken into account for ion helium single ionization fdcss at different perturbation regimes .",
    "atomic units are used throughout unless otherwise stated .",
    "we regard he single ionization as a single electron process and assume that ( i ) the initial state for the ` active ' electron is described by a semi - analytical rothan  hartree  fock scheme using a 5 parameters wave function ( clemente and roetti 1974 ) and ( ii ) in the final state the ` active ' target electron moves in the combined coulomb field of the target core with an effective charge @xmath4 . the electron - projectile relative motion",

    "eis approach , i.e. one eikonal phase in the entrance channel and a pure coulomb distortion in the final one .",
    "n interaction is treated as a pure coulomb interaction between the projectile with a charge @xmath5 and the true target core charge , @xmath6 = 1 .",
    "n interaction is taken into account in the transition amplitude @xmath7 , in the usual semi - classical or eikonal approximation , through its multiplication by a phase factor ( mccarroll and salin 1978 ) , which for pure coulomb internuclear interaction results in ( crothers and mccann 1983 ) @xmath8 were @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the velocity of the impinging projectile and @xmath11 is the impact parameter @xmath12 .",

    "this approximation is valid as long as ( i ) the projectile suffers very small deflections in the collision and ( ii ) the velocity of the recoil ion remains small compared to that of the emitted electron .    within cdw ",
    "eis , transition amplitude can be computed as    @xmath16    in its post version or @xmath17 in the prior version , where the initial ( final ) state distorted wave @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is an approximation to the initial ( final ) state which satisfies outgoing - wave ( @xmath20 ) ( incoming - wave ( @xmath21 ) ) conditions . for the initial state the asymptotic form of the coulomb distortion ( eikonal phase )",

    "the solid angles @xmath55 and @xmath56 represent the direction of scattering of the projectile and the ionized electron , respectively .",
    "we use non - orthogonal jacobi coordinates @xmath57 to outline the collision process .",
    "these coordinates are the position of the active electron with respect to the projectile ( @xmath58 ) and to the target ion ( @xmath59 ) respectively . also the coordinate @xmath60 is needed",
    ", that represents the position of the incoming projectile with respect to the center of mass of the subsystem e - t .",
    "if we neglect terms of order @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the mass of the target ion nucleus and @xmath64 is the corresponding to the incident heavy ion , we can write @xmath65 .",
    "we have replaced the transition matrix in the post and prior schemes ( equations ( [ post ] ) and ( [ prior ] ) ) in the definition of fdcs ( [ fdcs ] ) and we have applied it to several single ionization processes .",
    "we have performed calculations for different projectiles , spanning a large range of perturbation strengths as measured by charge to velocity ratio @xmath66 . in figure 1 we present results for 100 mev amu@xmath1 c@xmath0 ( schulz _ et al _ 2001 ) single ionization of helium calculated in prior cdw ",
    "eis , for different values of electron emission energy ( @xmath67 ) and momentum transfer ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "calculations are in very good agreement with available experimental results .    in figure 2 we layout results for other theories applied to the same process for an intermediate value of electron energy and momentum transfer .",
    "we see that prior cdw  eis gives the best results . even when @xmath69 both fba and post cdw ",
    "eis fail to accurately describe the experimental results , although they broadly reproduce the angular distribution .",

    "ev , results for prior version are in reasonable agreement with experiment , however both theories fail to correctly reproduce the strong forward emission peak , which is due to the strong projectile electron post collisional interaction ( pci ) .",
    "trend is similar for @xmath71 ev , ( figure 4 ) where we see a better performance in prior version calculations , in particular in the prediction of the direct peak position .",
    "note that no renormalization factor is included in these calculations .    in figures 5 and 6",
    "we show prior and post cdw  eis calculations for 3.6 mev amu@xmath1 au@xmath3 impact ionization of he . even when we are stretching the validity range of the perturbative treatment a bit too much ( @xmath72 for au@xmath2 and au@xmath3 projectiles respectively ) , angular structure with only one strong peak",
    "is correctly predicted in prior version while post version of the theory predicts two distinct direct and recoil peak .",
    "however the position of the peak is not correctly given in prior version , again because the theory underestimates the strong pci between the impinging ion and the ejected electron , which shifts the emission towards the forward direction .",
    "both versions including n - n interaction fail to yield the correct order of magnitude of experimental data .",
    "large projectile charges are likely to induce quite a large polarization in the target .",
    "effective charges both for residual target - electron and n  n interactions are probably not the same than for lower charged projectiles , and it is indeed very probable that the effective charge approach is not a good approximation here .",
    "model potentials taking into account polarization effects need to be considered for the target , at least in the exit channel , but most probably in both initial and final states .",
    "we have performed fdcss calculations for highly charged ion impact ionization of helium .",

    "n interaction but otherwise using as simple an approach for electronic wave functions as possible . indeed , use of prior version helps us to avoid the need of more precise wave functions for the initial or final electronic state .",
    "we found reasonably good agreement with experimental data , even for projectile charges for which the system is arguably outside the range of validity of a perturbative theory .",
    "we see that for emission in the collision plane , three body dynamics seems to be enough to explain most of the structures observed for low energy emission and low projectile charge . for au@xmath2 and au@xmath3 projectiles",
    "the larger emission in the forward direction is not well reproduced by the theory but , as said before , those cases are outside the range where perturbative treatments are known to be valid . however",
