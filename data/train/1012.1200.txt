    "control of chaotic transport is an important topic in many areas of physics with considerable research and technical applications .",
    "its aim is to reduce chaos when it is harmful and enhance it when it is beneficial .",
    "a lot of efforts have been devoted to reduce chaotic and turbulent transport in laboratory plasma physics .",
    "two examples are afforded by the control of stochasticity of magnetic field lines and the transport generated by plasma instabilities . in magnetically confined fusion plasmas , like tokamaks , the electrostatic turbulence associated with the @xmath1 drift motion , is one of the main sources for the loss of energy confinement  @xcite and consequently constitutes a relevant obstacle to the attainment of plasma ignition .",
    "the development of control strategies able to induce a relevant change in transport properties by means of a small and localized perturbation constitutes a way to understand the complex behavior of laboratory plasmas .",
    "a convenient way to control these systems is by using electromagnetic fields .",
    "since the plasma dynamics is very sensitive to electrostatic fluctuations , a control method for the @xmath1 drift motion of test particles has been proposed by a small and apt modification of the electrostatic potential  @xcite .",
    "this method has been tested on a travelling - wave tube ( twt ) for the reduction of chaotic transport  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that for these methods , the relevant modifications were applied in all the plasma region . to step forward in the applicability of this control scheme to more complex plasma devices",
    ", we present a method and its practical algorithm to construct a transport barrier for the radial dynamics where the modification of the potential is only applied locally in a peripheral region of the plasma",
    ". our strategy does not depend on the electrostatic potential at hand whether it is known analytically , numerically or experimentally .",
    "the geometry we are considering is a cylindrical spatial geometry which is shared by many linear devices like for example vineta  @xcite , mirabelle  @xcite or csdx  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as in these devices the plasma temperature is not too high , plasma density and electrostatic potential are routinely measured by inserting probe arrays with large radial and poloidal extents . in that way it is possible to have a very accurate description of the space time behavior of the plasma  @xcite .",
    "in addition it is worth noticing that it is also possible to act on the plasma using electrodes directly in contact with the plasma , producing for example a mode locking between the injected sinusoidal signal and the plasma dynamics  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the sol region of tokamaks where the field lines are connected to the wall , a parallel current created by probes acts on perpendicular dynamics  @xcite .",
    "+ section 2 deals with the analytical solution of the potential to create a radial transport barrier for test particles . in sec .",
    "3 , we describe the numerical algorithm to compute this modified potential from the electrostatic potential data .",
    "finally , section 4 is dedicated to the computation and the results of the control of test particle dynamics in a mock electrostatic potential .",
    "the equations of motion of charged particles ( of charge @xmath2 and mass @xmath3 ) in electromagnetic fields ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) can be obtained in a hamiltonian framework @xcite where the hamiltonian is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the position of the particle and @xmath8 is its canonically conjugate momentum . in strong magnetic fields ,",
    "particles have a fast gyration motion around the guiding - center @xcite .",
    "the relation between the position of the particle and its guiding center is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the position of the guiding - center and @xmath11 is the larmor vector . in what follows",
    ", we restrict our study to the case where the magnetic field is constant and uniform : @xmath12 . in this case , in order to reduce the system , we apply the generalized canonical transformation @xmath13 given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xcite : @xmath16 and the poisson bracket has pairs of conjugate coordinates : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 it is important to notice that the two coordinates ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) of the guiding center in the plane transverse to the magnetic field are conjugate , as well as the two velocities ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) of the particle in this transverse plane .",
    "nothing is changed along the direction of the field lines . in order to reduce the dimensionality of our system ,",
    "we approximate the potential by @xmath25 which is a standard hypothesis for plasma devices with a strong magnetic field . in this way",
    ", we notice that the equations of motion for the position of the guiding center are decoupled from the ones of the velocity of the particle .",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath26 that is the velocity of the guiding centers is equal to the @xmath27 drift velocity .",
    "we consider a cylindrical geometry as encountered in linear plasma devices . in this geometry ,",
    "the polar coordinates are better suited .",
    "we perform the ( non - canonical ) change of coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the poisson bracket of the reduced system in the poloidal plane is changed into  @xcite @xmath30 with a reduced hamiltonian @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . in what follows",
    ", we remove the tildas for simplicity of the notations .",
    "hence , the equations of motion for the guiding centers are : @xmath33 the singularity at @xmath34 can be removed by reformulating the equations of motion in the canonically conjugate pair of variables @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "however the singularity is in general not a problem in the numerical integration of test particles since the measured fluctuating potentials vanish in the core region around @xmath34 .",
    "the important region where confinement is crucial is the peripheral ( edge ) region .",
    "we are looking at modifications of the hamiltonian , i.e. of the electrostatic potential @xmath37 , in order to create a radial transport barrier .",
    "we consider the following expression for the controlled potential @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the control function that has to be determined .",
    "we define the map @xmath41 as : @xmath42 with which the controlled potential is written as @xmath43 .",
    "we impose that this new potential creates a transport barrier for the guiding centers located at @xmath44 .",

    "this equation has two unknown functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 to be determined .",
    "we assume that the time - average of @xmath37 is zero for all @xmath52 at a given radius @xmath53 .",

    "the first expression @xmath62 for the control term implies that the potential has to be modified on the entire phase space .",
    "however it is desirable to only apply the modifications on a particular region of the transverse plane . in order to localize radially the control required for creating the transport barrier , a first idea is to localize the potential modifications in a neighborhood of the barrier @xmath63 .",
    "the fact that this localization is varying in time makes this strategy challenging for an experimental realization . in order to address this issue",
    "we adopt a slightly different strategy : the control term @xmath64 leads to a modification of the potential only in the neighborhood of a circle of radius @xmath53 which is more adapted to an experimental application since the control is envisaged through a set of probes usually aligned along a circle , or a predefined fixed geometry ( see below ) .",

    "<S> we consider the radial transport of test particles due to the @xmath0 drift motion in the guiding center approximation . using an explicit expression to modify the electrostatic potential , we show that it is possible to construct a transport barrier which suppresses radial transport . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an algorithm for the implementation of this local modification computed from an electrostatic potential known on a spatio - temporal grid . </S>",
    "<S> the number of particles which escape the inner region defined by the barrier measures the efficiency of the control . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the control is robust by showing a significant reduction of radial transport , when applied with a reduced number of probes aligned on a circle . </S>"
