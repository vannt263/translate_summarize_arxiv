    "our understanding of the structure of the atomic nucleus is at present incomplete , based as it is on various models with limited ranges of applicability .",
    "examples are the spherical shell model and the geometric collective model . while the former stresses the single - particle nature of the nucleons in the nucleus , their coherent motion is emphasized by the latter . a recurring question in more than half a century of basic nuclear research has been how to reconcile two such opposing views of the structure of the nucleus .",
    "the currently accepted paradigm is that the structural patterns and regularities , as predicted by the geometric collective model , arise as emergent behaviour from the complex many - body problem of nucleonic interactions in the context of the spherical shell model .",
    "while this connection can , perhaps , be established in principle , and much current work is going on along these lines , many of its aspects still remain unclear . in this paper",
    "we study this question from the perspective of symmetries .",
    "ever since the pioneering studies by wigner , racah and elliott , symmetry considerations have played a pivotal role in the development of nuclear models , in particular of the spherical shell model .",
    "we do not intend to review here all such symmetries but focus on those that make contact with the geometric collective model .",
    "an alternative microscopic approach to nuclear collective motion that is under intense current investigation involves the use of self - consistent mean - field models  @xcite , whereby nuclei are described variationally from realistic interactions between their constituent nucleons .",
    "there has also been much recent work to take these models beyond mean field  @xcite .",
    "models based on symmetries provide exactly solvable limits for the same collective features described by these mean - field approaches , but at the cost of using semi - realistic , rather than fully realistic , hamiltonians .",
    "nevertheless , because of the exact solvability of these symmetry - based models , unique perspectives on collective properties can often be identified .",
    "we start by painting a qualitative picture of the two models we aim connect in this paper in sections  ( [ ss_sm ] ) and  ( [ ss_bm ] ) .",
    "one symmetry of the spherical shell model is su(3 ) , which forms the basis of our understanding of nuclear rotation .",
    "it can be given a rigorous formulation in the context of wigner s supermultiplet model , which is reviewed in section  [ s_wigner ] .",
    "su(3 ) model of quadrupole deformation is discussed in section  [ s_elliott ] , first in its elementary version applied to a single major shell of the harmonic oscillator and subsequently in its extended version applied to several shells .",
    "section  [ s_octu ] deals with the analogous problem of octupole deformation and proposes a corresponding symmetry in the context of the spherical shell model .",
    "some concluding remarks are made in section  [ s_conc ] .      in first approximation",
    "the structure of a nucleus is determined by the nuclear mean field , that is , the average potential felt by each nucleon resulting from the interactions with all others . in particular , the observed shell structure of nuclei can be understood on the basis of the notion of mean field . however , for a detailed description of many nuclear properties , a residual nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction on top of the average potential must be taken into account .",
    "nuclear structure at low energies is particularly affected by the residual interaction between nucleons in the valence shell , that is , in the outermost shell that is not completely filled .    while a current focus of nuclear structure theory aims at a consistent microscopic derivation of the nuclear mean field and the residual interaction , several of the basic features of the structure of nuclei",
    "are captured in the following schematic nuclear hamiltonian : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the atomic mass number ( the number of nucleons in the nucleus ) , @xmath5 is a short - hand notation for the spatial coordinates , the spin and isospin variables of nucleon @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the first term in equation  ( [ e_hamsm ] ) is the kinetic energy of the nucleons .",
    "the second term is a harmonic - oscillator potential with frequency @xmath9 , which is governed by the nuclear size and which is a crude approximation to the nuclear mean field  @xcite for well - bound nuclei .",
    "a more realistic nuclear mean field , ( _ e.g. _ , a woods  saxon potential ) does not display the degeneracy of states with different orbital angular momentum @xmath10 in the same major shell , characteristic of a harmonic oscillator . to some extent this deficiency of the harmonic - oscillator potential",
    "can be remedied by adding an @xmath11 orbit  orbit term , which lifts the @xmath10-degeneracy and gives rise to a single - particle spectrum more in accord with that from experiment .",
    "the fourth term in the hamiltonian  ( [ e_hamsm ] ) corresponds to a spin  orbit coupling in the nucleonic motion , whose assumption was the decisive step in the justification of the nuclear shell model  @xcite by providing a natural explanation of the observed ` magic ' numbers , those neutron @xmath0 or proton @xmath12 numbers for which the nucleus acquires an increased stability .",
    "the fact that the spin ",
    "orbit interaction is strong gives rise to another very important feature in nuclear structure , namely that the higher major shells contain orbitals that intrude from the next oscillator shell and have the opposite parity from the others in the major shell .",
    "the last term in equation  ( [ e_hamsm ] ) is the residual two - body interaction .",
    "it depends in a complex fashion on the mean field and on the valence space that is made available to the nucleons . because of its dependence on the space in which it acts , it is often referred to as an _ effective _ interaction .",
    "if single - particle energy spacings are large compared to a typical matrix element of the residual interaction , nucleons move independently .",
    "this limit corresponds to the shell model of independent particles .",
    "the neglect of the last term in the hamiltonian  ( [ e_hamsm ] ) leads to uncorrelated many - particle eigenstates that are slater determinants constructed from the single - particle eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "slater determinants involve products of single - particle states , organized so that the wave function is fully anti - symmetric under particle interchange , as required by the pauli principle .",
    "this is the key to the shell structure exhibited by nuclei .",
    "if the residual interaction is not neglected , a true many - body problem results , where it is critical to incorporate configuration mixing of the slater determinants resulting from the residual interaction .",
    "usually it is only necessary to include configuration mixing within a single major shell for neutrons and a single major shell for protons , except fairly near shell closure , where coherent excitations from other major shells can be lowered into the region of low - lying states of the dominant shell and must therefore be considered on the same footing .    a good approximation to the residual effective interaction for use in a shell - model treatment of nuclei involves a pairing interaction @xmath13 , acting between pairs of alike nucleons in time - reversed orbits , and a sum of separable two - body interactions acting between all nucleons , _ viz . _",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 creates a coherent particle  hole pair with multipolarity @xmath16 and parity @xmath17 . in fairly light nuclei the connection between modern realistic effective interactions and a schematic sum over separable interactions has been carefully demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the term with @xmath18 , called the monopole interaction , has the primary effect of evolving the single - particle energies of the nuclear mean field , sometimes even changing the order of single - particle levels and the magic numbers  @xcite .",
    "the other terms govern the mixing of simple shell - model configurations that give rise to the wide variety of features seen in nuclei across the periodic table .",
    "the pairing component of the residual interaction , @xmath13 in equation  ( [ e_vres ] ) , has far - reaching consequences .",
    "perhaps most importantly , it gives rise to pairing correlations , which have a pervasive impact on nuclear structure properties throughout the periodic table .",
    "for the purposes of this discussion , however , the pairing interaction , as well as the related delta interaction , @xmath19 , conserve total orbital angular momentum @xmath20 and total spin @xmath21 , besides total angular momentum @xmath16 associated with rotational invariance .",
    "when this term dominates , it leads to a classification called @xmath22 ( or russell  saunders ) coupling .",
    "this is strongly broken , however , by the spin ",
    "orbit term in the nuclear mean field , which favours @xmath23 coupling .",
    "the conflict between @xmath22 coupling and @xmath23 coupling plays a crucial role in determining the structure of the nucleus , as was recognized and studied in the earliest days of the nuclear shell model  @xcite .",
    "the generally accepted conclusion is that @xmath23 coupling is relevant for the vast majority of nuclei while the @xmath22 classification is appropriate for the very lightest nuclei only  @xcite .    under certain circumstances",
    "a residual three - body interaction must also be taken into account  @xcite . in very light nuclei , the effects of three - body forces are especially important and they must be incorporated fully  @xcite . in heavier nuclei",
    "their effects are less pronounced and can typically be absorbed into the mean field , analogous to the two - body monopole interaction  @xcite .",
    "a second important feature that plays a critical role in dictating the structure of the nucleus is the number of active neutrons and protons in the valence shell(s ) .",
    "as noted earlier , the residual interaction between identical nucleons has a pairing character which favours the formation of pairs of nucleons in time - reversed orbits .",
    "this is no longer true if the valence space contains both neutrons and protons , in which case there is a strong attraction in _ all _ orbits resulting primarily through the quadrupole interaction [ @xmath24 in equation  ( [ e_vres ] ) ] but with contributions under appropriate circumstances from other multipoles .",
    "hence , nuclei display a wide range of possible spectra that can vary from pairing - type to rotational - like .",
    "the evolution from one type to the other is governed by the product of the number of neutrons with the number of protons in the valence shell  @xcite .    in heavier nuclei , _",
    "i.e. _ in the rare - earth and actinide regions , the mixing between orbitals with different parities becomes increasingly more important . in these regimes",
    "important octupole - like ( @xmath25 ) correlations arise , and it is typically necessary to incorporate them along with pairing and quadrupole correlations .      in 1879 , in a study of the properties of a droplet of incompressible liquid , lord rayleigh showed  @xcite that its normal modes of vibration may be described by the variables @xmath26 which appear in the expansion of the droplet s radius , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are spherical harmonics in terms of the spherical angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in spite of some obvious differences between a quantized atomic nucleus and a classical liquid drop ,",
    "the latter has been used to describe the properties of the atomic nucleus since the pioneering work of von weizscker  @xcite and bohr and kalckar  @xcite . since then it has been customary for nuclear physicists to adopt the multipole parameterization  ( [ e_surface ] ) to describe vibrations of the nuclear fluid .",
    "there were several key steps and observations that followed soon after these original works .",
    "feenberg  @xcite and bohr and wheeler  @xcite studied the shape and stability of a deformed and of a charged liquid drop . a few years later flgge  @xcite noted that nuclear rotations may produce rotational spectra , though he did not yet appreciate that surface vibrations and rotations may be related to one another .",
    "these ideas eventually culminated in the geometric collective model , introduced in the classical papers by rainwater  @xcite , bohr  @xcite , and bohr and mottelson  @xcite .",
    "the geometric collective model complements the spherical shell model by emphasizing the coherent behaviour of many nucleons , including quadrupole and higher - multipole deformations as well as rotations and vibrations that involve a large portion of the nucleus  @xcite .    a key contribution of bohr  @xcite and bohr and mottelson  @xcite was to note that the static shape and orientation of a deformed nucleus and the collective deformation variables of a spherical nucleus were related to each other .",
    "flgge had already suggested  @xcite that these collective variables could play the role of dynamical variables but it was bohr  @xcite who extended this from a classical to a quantum drop . in this picture",
    "the @xmath26 in the nuclear surface  ( [ e_surface ] ) are considered as ( time - dependent ) variables that determine the shape of the nuclear surface .",
    "for particular choices of @xmath31 different shapes result .",

    "we conclude that in the three - shell @xmath257@xmath217@xmath258 system _ two _ irreducible representations ( 9,0 ) occur among the low - energy one - particle  one - hole excitations .",
    "one is spurious and must be eliminated ; the other is physical and is included in figure  [ f_ne20 ] .",
    "these results are obtained under the assumption that all observed states in @xmath289ne belong to the favoured supermultiplet @xmath118=[4,4,4,4]$ ] of @xmath298 . while the hypothesis of maximal spatial symmetry might be acceptable for the single - shell su(3 ) model , it is more questionable in the case of several shells . in ref .",

    "these operators close under commutation and a linear combination of them corresponds to the physical quadrupole operator @xmath338 .",
    "the @xmath340 model contains all the necessary ingredients for the description of quadrupole - deformed states in the context of the spherical shell model with enhanced collectivity due to cross - shell excitations .",
    "the question arises whether a generic classification exists for octupole - deformed shell - model states , similar to the one constructed by elliott for quadrupole deformation .",
    "the minimal realization in this case should be in terms of the three components @xmath193 of the angular momentum operator and the seven components @xmath348 of the octupole operator .",

    "a striking feature of the eigenspectrum of the hamiltonian  ( [ e_hamo1 ] ) is the presence of several parity doublets at low excitation energy in the odd  odd system with @xmath235 .",
    "while the components in equation  ( [ e_ang1 ] ) are associated with the orbital angular momentum , it is not _ a priori _ obvious that @xmath438 and @xmath348 have anything to do with the physical dipole and octupole operators .",

    "any su(4)-scalar operator of multipolarity @xmath31 can be written as @xmath439 where the coefficients @xmath440 can be considered as the definition of the operator @xmath441 . in second quantization",

    "no closure property is exactly valid for @xmath452 if @xmath453 but an approximate treatment is possible in the limit of large oscillator shells , @xmath2 . to see this point , we introduce into the generators  ( [ e_sopm2 ] ) of @xmath386 the explicit expressions  ( [ e_dtensor2 ] ) for the double tensors @xmath364 and @xmath365 , leading to the coefficients @xmath454 since in the limit of large @xmath0 one has the property  @xcite @xmath455 we conclude that the matrix elements of the generators @xmath456 of @xmath386 tend to those of the operators @xmath450 , @xmath457 this approximation is reasonable even for relatively low values of @xmath0 as long as @xmath10 and @xmath101 are not too large .",

    "it is indeed seen that deviations grow with increasing @xmath10 and @xmath101 , especially for the octupole operator .",
    "the last line of each entry lists the coefficients appropriate for the dipole or octupole operators @xmath442 and calculated with harmonic - oscillator radial wave functions . since the same normalization factor is adopted as for @xmath450 , the first coefficient , @xmath461 or @xmath462 , deviates from the algebraic definition and this deviation depends on the radial integrals @xmath448 .",
    "we conclude this subsection with two further remarks concerning the results in table  [ t_coefs ] .",
    "the first concerns the signs of the coefficients @xmath464 and @xmath465 which are seen in some cases to deviate from those of the coefficients of @xmath456 . this can be remedied by a change of phase of the type @xmath466 for certain single - particle orbital angular momenta @xmath10 .",
    "closure properties are not affected by such changes of phase and , consequently , the solvability property proven above remains valid .",
    "this property is well known for bosons  @xcite and also applies to fermionic systems . for the @xmath217@xmath258 and @xmath258@xmath249 shells",
    "enough freedom exists to accommodate any combination of signs of the coefficients @xmath459 .",
    "in other words , there always exists a change of phase of the @xmath467 for certain single - particle orbital angular momenta @xmath468 such that the signs of @xmath459 in the generators @xmath456 are as required .",
    "this remains true for the dipole operator for any @xmath0 but is no longer generally valid for the octupole operator if @xmath469 , that is , for the @xmath249@xmath470 shells and beyond .",
    "the second remark concerns the dependence of the coefficients @xmath465 on the radial integrals @xmath448 .",
    "the coefficients listed in table  [ t_coefs ] are for a harmonic oscillator and other potentials lead to different results .",
    "suppose we can find a potential with the property @xmath471 ( where @xmath472 is an arbitrary constant ) for all @xmath473 such that @xmath474 .",
    "for such a potential the following proportionality is valid without any approximation : @xmath475 implying an _ exact _ algebraic realization of the operator @xmath476 .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ e_hamo1 ] ) contains the dipole interaction @xmath477 , which we may wish to eliminate .",
    "in particular , for @xmath360 and @xmath248 ( the @xmath217@xmath258 and @xmath258@xmath249 shells ) , two cases of main interest , elimination of @xmath477 leads to a pure octupole interaction @xmath478 .",
    "this elimination is achieved by noting that , since @xmath479 and @xmath480 , one has @xmath481 and therefore the dipole interaction is diagonal in the basis @xmath353 [ \\bar h]&&[\\bar h_a]&&[\\bar h_b]&&\\langle\\bar\\omega_a\\rangle&&\\langle\\bar\\omega_b\\rangle \\end{array } \\nonumber\\\\\\nonumber\\\\[-10pt ] & \\begin{array}{cccccccccc } \\supset\\!\\!\\!\\!&{\\rm so}_a(3)&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\otimes\\!\\!\\!\\!&{\\rm so}_b(3)&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\supset\\!\\!\\!\\!&{\\rm so}_+(3)\\\\ & \\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&\\\\[0 mm ] & l_a&&l_b&&l \\end{array } , \\label{e_claso2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with eigenstates @xmath215;([\\bar h];[\\bar h_a]\\langle\\bar\\omega_a\\rangle l_a\\times[\\bar h_b]\\langle\\bar\\omega_b\\rangle l_b ; l)\\times[\\bar h']st\\rangle,\\ ] ] and with energy eigenvalues @xmath482 the bases  ( [ e_claso1 ] ) and  ( [ e_claso2 ] ) are connected by a unitary transformation , latexmath:[\\ ] ] that is , all partitions constructed out of @xmath549 $ ] and @xmath550 $ ] , respectively .",
    "some of the irreducible representations of @xmath551 and @xmath552 that appear in these branching rules have more labels than allowed and must be eliminated or modified .",
