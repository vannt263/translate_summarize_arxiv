    "recent use of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) as standard candles @xcite provided an opportunity to obtain the distance - redshift relation  and measure the cosmological parameters  without recourse to the `` distance ladder '' .",
    "sne ia provide strong evidence for the acceleration of the universe , thus implying that a component called `` dark energy '' with strongly negative pressure ( @xmath6 ) dominates the energy - density of the universe .",
    "the most likely candidate for the dark energy is the vacuum energy , with @xmath7 .",
    "sne ia provide the luminosity distance  redshift relation and thus effectively determine the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , energy densities in matter and vacuum energy scaled to the critical energy density .",
    "the best - fit value using the current dataset of @xmath8 sne ia and assuming a flat universe is @xmath9 , with @xmath10-@xmath11 error of order @xmath12 .    given the importance of sne ia as standard candles  namely , determining the contents of the universe and probing the dark energy",
    " it is important to consider what can be done to improve upon the constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "two obvious improvements would be increasing the size of the supernova sample and better control over the systematic errors . going to redshifts beyond one is also very high on supernova cosmologists wish list because that way one can differentiate between the effects of dust and dark energy .",
    "it is believed that , barring unusual scenarios , dust would make faraway objects progressively fainter , while the dark energy becomes inoperative at @xmath13 because the universe is essentially matter - dominated at those redshifts .",
    "finally , an important requirement would be to have supernovae located throughout the probed redshift range , in order to make sure that the magnitude - redshift relation traced out corresponds to the dark energy , and not evolution or dust .",
    "the planned supernova space telescope , snap  @xcite , would satisfy all of the above - mentioned requirements .",
    "this work considers supernova search strategies for the most accurate determination of cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( and possibly the equation of state ratio of the dark energy , @xmath2 , where q stands for quintessence @xcite ) . to this end , we ask : given the cosmological parameters we want to determine , what is the optimal distribution of supernovae in redshift in order to best constrain those parameters ? at first glance this problem may appear of purely academic interest since we are not free to put supernovae where we please .",
    "however , supernova observers have considerable freedom in choosing redshift ranges for their searches , by using filters sensitive to wavelengths corresponding to spectra at observed redshifts .",
    "moreover , the increased difficulty in observing high - redshift supernovae means that , even with great improvement in supernova detection and follow - up techniques , it can be as time - consuming to observe one supernova at , say , @xmath14 as many @xmath15 supernovae . hence , an observer will have to decide how much telescope time is to be allocated to specific redshift ranges to best constrain the cosmological parameters .    in this work",
    "we make three assumptions :    @xmath16 magnitude uncertainty , @xmath17 , is the same for each supernova irrespective of redshift ( this is a pretty good approximation , at least for current data sets ) .",
    "@xmath16 total number of observed supernovae is fixed ( rather than the total observing time , for example ) .",
    "@xmath16 there is an unlimited number of supernovae at each redshift .",
    "none of these assumptions is required to use the formalism we present . moreover",
    ", the results we present should qualitatively not be very different from those obtained when the constraints above are relaxed .",
    "we make the assumptions above to illustrate our approach and simplify the analysis .",
    "we tackle the following problem : given @xmath18 supernovae and their corresponding uncertainties , what distribution of these supernovae in redshift would enable the most accurate determination of cosmological parameters ? in case of more than one parameter , we need to define what we mean by most accurate determination of all parameters simultaneously .",
    "since the uncertainty in measuring @xmath3 parameters simultaneously is described by an @xmath3-dimensional ellipsoid ( at least under assumption that the total likelihood function is gaussian ) , we make a fairly obvious and , as it turns out , mathematically tractable requirement that the ellipsoid have minimal volume .",
    "this requirement corresponds to the best _ local _ determination of the parameters .",
    "we now show that volume of the ellipsoid is given by    @xmath19    where the sign of proportionality expresses our ignorance of a numerical factor , and @xmath20 is the fisher matrix @xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the likelihood of observing data set @xmath23 given the parameters @xmath24",
    ". although this relation might be familiar / obvious to mathematically inclined cosmologists , we present its derivation for completeness .    to prove equation ( [ vol_ellipsoid ] ) , consider a general uncertainty ellipsoid in @xmath18-dimensional parameter space .",
    "the equation of this ellipsoid is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the vector of coordinates and @xmath20 the fisher matrix .",
    "let us now rotate the ellipsoid so that all of its axes are parallel to coordinate axes .",
    "equivalently we can rotate the coordinates to achieve the same effect , by writing @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the orthogonal matrix corresponding to this rotation .",
    "the equation of the ellipsoid in the new coordinate system is @xmath29 or equivalently , in the original coordinate system @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the fisher matrix for the rotated ellipsoid , and has the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 the i - th axis of the ellipsoid .",
    "the volume of the ( rotated ) ellipsoid is obviously    @xmath34    then , since @xmath35 and rotations preserve volumes , we have @xmath36 and this completes the proof .      to minimize the volume of the ellipsoid we therefore need to maximize @xmath37 .",
    "fisher matrix for the case of supernova measurements was first worked out by tegmark et al .",
    "@xcite , and we briefly recapitulate their results , with slightly different notation and one addition .",
    "the measurements are given as @xmath38+{\\mathcal{m}}+\\epsilon_n,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is apparent magnitude of the @xmath18th supernova in the sample , @xmath40 is its luminosity distance , @xmath41  @xcite ( with @xmath42 absolute magnitude of a supernova ) , and @xmath43 is the error in that measurement ( assumed to be drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath17 ) .",
    "note that @xmath44 contains all dependence on @xmath45 , since @xmath46 .",
    "the fisher matrix is given by @xcite    @xmath47    where @xmath48 s are weight functions given by @xmath49\\over s[\\kappa i(z ) ] } \\left[{\\partial i\\over\\partial p_i } - { i(z)\\over   2\\kappa^2}\\right ] + { 1\\over   2\\kappa^2 } \\right\\ } ,   \\label{w_defined}\\ ] ] if the parameter @xmath50 is @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( or @xmath51 ) , or else @xmath52\\over s[\\kappa i(z ) ] } \\ , { \\partial i\\over\\partial p_i}\\right]\\ ] ] if @xmath50 is @xmath2 .",
    "also    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55   a(z ) & = & \\omega_m ( 1+z)^3 + \\omega_{\\lambda } + \\kappa^2 ( 1+z)^2 \\label{a_def } \\\\ [ 0.1 cm ]   \\kappa^2   & = & 1- \\omega_m - \\omega_{\\lambda}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath56 are the energy densities in matter , cosmological constant and curvature respectively divided by the critical density , and @xmath57 . later on",
    "we also consider a more general equation of state for the exotic energy , and replace the second term in equation ( [ a_def ] ) by @xmath58 .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 , @xmath51 and @xmath2 , the magnitude - redshift relation also includes the `` nuisance parameter '' @xmath5 , which is a combination of the hubble parameter and absolute magnitude of supernovae , and which has to be marginalized over in order to obtain constraints on parameters of interest .",
    "ignoring @xmath5 in the fisher matrix formalism ( that is , assuming that @xmath59 is known ) leads to a serious underestimate of the uncertainties in other parameters ( of course , fairly accurate knowledge of @xmath45 could be used to obtain @xmath42 from a sample of nearby supernovae , and thus determine @xmath5 ) .",
    "we continue to ignore @xmath5 for simplicity and mathematical clarity , and in section  [ mathcal - sec ] we show that including marginalization over @xmath5 changes our results rather trivially .",
    "the fisher matrix can further be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the ( normalized ) distribution of redshifts of the data and @xmath62 is the highest redshift probed in the survey . _",
    "our goal is to find @xmath63 such that @xmath37 is maximal_. @xmath63 is essentially a histogram of supernovae normalized to have unit area .",
    "note that the maximization of @xmath37 will not depend on @xmath3 and @xmath17 , so we drop them from further analysis . to consider a non - constant error @xmath64 , one simply absorbs @xmath64 into the definition of weight functions @xmath65 .",
    "we first consider the trivial  but instructive  case of one parameter .",
    "then we need to maximize @xmath66 , subject to @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is quite obvious that the solution is a single delta function at the redshift where @xmath69 has a maximum . for any given parameter @xmath69 will have a maximum at @xmath70 and",
    "that is where we want all our supernovae to be .",
    "this result is hardly surprising : we have a one - parameter family of curves @xmath71 , and the best way to distinguish between them is to have all measurements at the redshift where the curves differ the most , at @xmath70 .    .",
    "magnitudes for the @xmath72 flat model were subtracted from both curves for easier visualization , width=336,height=240 ]    as an example , fig .",
    "[ magdiff.fig ] shows magnitude - redshift curves for the fiducial @xmath72 model with the assumption @xmath73 ( flat universe ) .",
    "as @xmath0 is varied , the biggest difference in @xmath71 is at the highest redshift probed . in order to best",
    "constrain @xmath0 , therefore , all supernovae should ideally be located at @xmath74 , our assumed maximum redshift .",
    "a more interesting  and relevant  problem is minimizing the area of the ellipse which describes the uncertainties for two parameters .",
    "the expression to maximize is then    @xmath75   & = & { 1\\over 2 } \\int_{z_1=0}^{z_{\\rm max}}\\int_{z_2=0}^{z_{\\rm max } } g(z_1)\\ , g(z_2 )   \\,w^2(z_1 , z_2 ) \\,dz_1\\ , dz_2 , \\label{area_analytic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 is a known function of redshifts and cosmological parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ weight.fig ] ) and @xmath63 is subject to the same constraints as in case of one parameter .     for the case",
    "when @xmath72 and @xmath77 .",
    "_ right panel : _ variation of the magnitude - redshift curve when two cosmological parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are varied independently , width=230,height=192 ]     for the case when @xmath72 and @xmath77 .",
    "_ right panel : _ variation of the magnitude - redshift curve when two cosmological parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are varied independently , width=230,height=192 ]    despite a relatively harmless appearance of expression ( [ area_analytic ] ) , we found it impossible to maximize it analytically .",
    "fortunately , for all practical purposes numerical solution will be sufficient .",
    "returning to the discretized version of equation ( [ f_ij ] ) , we divide the interval @xmath78 into @xmath79 bins with @xmath80 supernovae in bin @xmath81",
    ". then we need to maximize @xmath82 subject to @xmath83    equations ( [ g_ij ] ) and ( [ quadprog.constr ] ) define a quadratic programming problem  extremization of a quadratic function subject to linear constraints . since @xmath84 is neither concave nor convex ( see fig .",
    "[ weight.fig ] ) , we have to resort to brute force maximization , and consider all possible values of @xmath85 .",
    "the result of this maximization is that the optimal distribution is two delta functions of equal magnitude : @xmath86 where all constants are accurate to @xmath87 .",
    "thus , half of the supernovae should be at the highest available redshift , while the other half at about 2/5 of the maximum redshift .",
    "this result is not very sensitive to the maximum redshift probed , or fiducial parameter values .",
    "if we increase the maximum available redshift to @xmath88 , we find two delta functions of equal magnitude at @xmath89 and @xmath90 . if we change the fiducial values of parameters to @xmath72 and @xmath91 ( open universe ) , we find delta functions of equal magnitude at @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "finally , let us consider a different choice for the two parameters  for example , @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( equation of state of the dark energy ) , with fiducial values @xmath72 and @xmath94 and with the assumption of flat universe ( @xmath95 ) . then , assuming @xmath96 , we get @xmath97 and again optimal distribution of supernovae is similar to the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as parameters .",
    "we further consider parameter determination with three parameters @xmath0 , @xmath51 and @xmath48 .",
    "elements of the 3x3 fisher matrix are calculated according to expression ( [ f_ij ] ) , and we again maximize @xmath37 as described above .",
    "the result is @xmath98 with all constants accurate to 0.01 .",
    "hence we have three delta functions of equal magnitude , with one of them at the highest available redshift .",
    "it appears impossible to prove that @xmath3 parameters are best measured if the data form @xmath3 delta functions in redshift .",
    "however , it is easy to prove that , _ if _ the data do form @xmath3 delta functions , then those delta functions should be of equal magnitude and their locations should be at coordinates where the `` total '' weight function ( e.g. @xmath84 in case of two parameters ) has a global maximum . in practice ,",
    "the relevant number of cosmological parameters to be determined from the sne ia data is between one and three , so considering more than three parameters is less relevant for practical purposes .",
    "so far we have been ignoring the parameter @xmath5 , assuming that it is known ( equivalently , that the value of @xmath45 and the absolute magnitude of supernovae are precisely known ) .",
    "this , of course , is not the case , and @xmath5 is marginalized over to obtain probabilities on cosmological parameters .",
    "fortunately , when @xmath5 is properly included , our results change in a predictable and rather trivial way , as we now show .",
    ", is varied .",
    "marginalization over @xmath5 is now included , which means that the curves are allowed to slide vertically as well , width=336,height=240 ]    including @xmath5 as an undetermined parameter , we now have an @xmath99-dimensional ellipsoid ( @xmath3 cosmological parameters plus @xmath5 ) , and we want to minimize the volume of its projection onto the @xmath3-dimensional space of cosmological parameters .",
    "the equation of the @xmath3-dimensional projection is    @xmath100    and @xmath101 is obtained as follows : 1 ) invert the original @xmath20 to obtain the covariance matrix @xmath102 2 ) pick the desired @xmath3x@xmath3 subset of @xmath102 and call it @xmath103 , and 3 ) invert it to get @xmath104 .    minimizing the volume of the projected ellipsoid we obtain the result that the optimal supernova distribution is obtained with @xmath3 delta functions in redshift obtained when ignoring @xmath5 , plus the delta function at @xmath105 .",
    "all @xmath99 delta functions have the same magnitude .",
    "the intuitive explanation for this result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ magdiff.offset.fig ] , which shows the magnitude - redshift curves when @xmath0 and @xmath5 are varied ( flat universe is assumed ) .",
    "this figure is the same as fig .",
    "[ magdiff.fig ] , except the curves are now allowed to slide vertically as well , corresponding to the variation in @xmath5 .",
    "there are two locations of largest departure when the two parameters are varied , namely @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "it makes sense then that those are precisely the locations where the supernovae should be , and our analysis says that we ideally need equal number of supernovae at each location .",
    "are the advantages of the optimal distribution significant enough that one should consider them seriously ? in our opinion the answer is affirmative , as we illustrate in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ compare.ellipses.fig ] .",
    "this figure shows that the area of the @xmath0-@xmath1 uncertainty ellipsoid is more than two times smaller if the sne have the optimal distribution in redshift as opposed to the case of uniform distribution .",
    "and @xmath1 when @xmath5 was marginalized over . to get the absolute sizes of the ellipses ,",
    "@xmath107 sne were assumed with individual uncertainties of @xmath108 mag . _",
    "right panel : _ thinnest possible ellipse for given @xmath3 and @xmath17 ( dark - blue ) is infinitely long in one direction .",
    "however , the smallest - area ellipse ( light - red ) is almost as thin , and for all purposes can serve as the thinnest ellipse , width=230,height=192 ]     and @xmath1 when @xmath5 was marginalized over . to get the absolute sizes of the ellipses ,",
    "@xmath107 sne were assumed with individual uncertainties of @xmath108 mag . _",
    "right panel : _ thinnest possible ellipse for given @xmath3 and @xmath17 ( dark - blue ) is infinitely long in one direction .",
    "however , the smallest - area ellipse ( light - red ) is almost as thin , and for all purposes can serve as the thinnest ellipse , width=230,height=192 ]      if we are using sne ia alone to determine the cosmological parameters , then we clearly want to minimize the area of the error ellipse ( we consider the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as parameters in this section ) .",
    "however , supernova measurements will also be combined with other methods to determine the parameters . a prime example of a symbiosis between two or more methods is combining cmb measurements with those of supernovae @xcite . these methods",
    "together can improve the determination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 up to a factor of 10 as compared to either method alone due to breaking of the degeneracy between the two parameters .",
    "as can be seen in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , in combining the cmb with sne ia data one might hope for the _ thinnest _ ellipse possible coming from supernova measurements . here by `` thin '' we mean that the combination @xmath109 is accurately determined .    finding",
    "the thinnest ellipse is the problem that we can solve using our formalism , since the length of each axis of the ellipse is proportional to the inverse square root of an eigenvalue of the corresponding fisher matrix .",
    "all we need to do then is maximize the larger eigenvalue of @xmath20 with respect to the distribution of the supernovae @xmath63 .",
    "the result is perhaps not at all surprising : to get the thinnest ellipse , all supernova measurements should be at the same ( maximum ) redshift , which at the same time implies an infinitely long ellipse .",
    "more generally , we find that changing the redshift distribution of supernovae does nt change the thickness of the error ellipse greatly , but does change its length . by attempting to obtain a thinner ellipse",
    ", we end up only making it longer .",
    "fortunately , the _ smallest area _",
    "ellipse we found can in practice serve as the thinnest ellipse , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ compare.ellipses.fig ] .",
    "it has been shown recently that a sufficiently good supernova sample could be used to reconstruct the potential of quintessence out to @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "more generally , equation of state ratio of the missing energy , @xmath2 , can also be reconstructed @xcite .    in the spirit of our analyses above",
    ", we ask : what distribution of supernovae in redshift gives the smallest 95% confidence region for the reconstructed potential @xmath111 ? to answer this question , we perform a monte - carlo simulation by using different distributions of supernovae and computing the average area of the confidence region corresponding to each of them .    uniform distribution of supernovae gives the best result among the several distributions we put to test .",
    "this is not surprising , because reconstruction of the potential consists in taking first and second derivatives of the distance - redshift curve , and the most accurate derivatives are obtained if the points are distributed uniformly . for comparison , gaussian distribution of supernovae with @xmath112 gives the area that is @xmath113% larger .",
    "we considered supernova search strategies that produce the tightest constraint on cosmological parameters by minimizing the volume of the error ellipsoid corresponding to those parameters .",
    "we first proved that , assuming that the total likelihood function is gaussian , the volume of an @xmath3-dimensional error ellipsoid is proportional to the inverse square root of the determinant of the corresponding fisher matrix .",
    "then we showed that , if the supernova measurements are used to determine @xmath3 parameters with @xmath114 or @xmath115 , this volume is minimized if the distribution of supernovae in redshift is given by @xmath3 delta functions of equal magnitude . in particular ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 have the smallest error ellipse if half of the measurements are at @xmath70 , while the other half are at roughly @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath5 is marginalized over , we need an additional supernova sample at @xmath105 ( a total of @xmath99 delta functions in redshift ) .",
    "our approach is quite flexible and can be applied in practice .",
    "for example , given the redshift - dependence of the measurement uncertainties for a given experiment , @xmath64 , as well as the time it takes to obtain a measurement at a given redshift ( determined by the telescope specifications ) , one can perform analysis similar to that in section [ sec - results ] to infer the optimal search strategy .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the best determination of the parameters around their fiducial values is only one of the possible objectives . as mentioned in the introduction , tracing out the magnitude - redshift curve throughout the redshift range is important to test for systematics such as evolution or dust .",
    "a sample of nearby supernovae would be useful to further check for systematics ( at least one low - z sn search program is already under way ) .",
    "ultimately , the chosen supernova search strategy should combine all of these considerations .",
    "we would like to thank members of the supernova cosmology project and daniel holz for useful discussions .",
