    "according to the kolmogorov - obukhov theory of developed hydrodynamic turbulence  @xcite , the velocity fluctuations at intermediate spatial scales @xmath2 obey the power - law @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mean energy flux from large to small scales .",
    "consequently , fluctuations of the vorticity field @xmath5 diverge at small scales as @xmath6 .",
    "these relations lead to @xmath7 for the energy spectrum in the corresponding range of wavenumbers @xmath8 ( the inertial interval ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the kolmogorov spectrum is linked with the small - scale structures of intense vorticity .",
    "the kolmogorov arguments are based on the isotropy of the flow and locality of nonlinear interaction at intermediate scales .",
    "then , the dynamics in the inertial interval can be described by the euler equations and the emergence of the kolmogorov spectrum can be expected before the viscous scales get excited  @xcite .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we studied the development of high - vorticity regions in incompressible 3d euler equations with high - accuracy numerical simulations for two initial conditions . according to  @xcite , in the generic case",
    "such regions represent exponentially compressing pancake - like structures ( thin vorticity sheets ) .",
    "contrary to these two studies , we found that evolution of the pancakes is governed by two different exponents @xmath9 and @xmath10 describing compression in the transverse direction and vorticity growth respectively , with the universal ratio @xmath11 .",
    "this ratio leads to the kolmogorov - type scaling @xmath0 between the vorticity maximum and pancake thickness .",
    "the pancakes appear in increasing number with different scales .",
    "we demonstrated that these structures generate strongly anisotropic vorticity field in the fourier space , concentrated in `` jets '' extended in the directions perpendicular to the pancakes .",
    "these jets , occupying only a small fraction of the entire spectral space , dominate in the energy spectrum , where we observed clearly formation of the interval with the kolmogorov scaling @xmath1 , in a fully inviscid flow .    in the present paper",
    "we continue this study , examining the influence of initial conditions on the processes of pancake formation and the kolmogorov energy spectrum development .",
    "we perform simulations for @xmath12 initial conditions in the form of a superposition of the shear flow @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and a random ( not necessarily small ) perturbation .",
    "the presence of the shear flow influences the orientation of emerging pancake structures , from fully random when the shear flow is absent to almost unidirectional close to @xmath16-axis when the perturbation is small .",
    "we observe that the scaling @xmath0 between the vorticity maximum and pancake thickness holds universally , while initial conditions composed of the shear flow and a small perturbation develop significantly longer intervals of wavenumbers with the energy spectrum close to the kolmogorov law @xmath1 .",
    "we integrate the incompressible 3d euler equations ( in the vorticity formulation ) @xmath17 in the periodic box @xmath18^{3}$ ] using pseudo - spectral runge - kutta fourth - order method .",
    "to avoid the so - called bottle - neck instability , we use filtering in the fourier space at each time step with the cut - off function suggested in  @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is wavevector , @xmath21 are the maximal wavenumbers and @xmath22 are numbers of nodes along directions @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 .",
    "function  ( [ hldumping ] ) cuts off approximately 20% of the spectrum at the edges of the spectral band in each direction . the inverse of the curl operator in eq .",
    "( [ euler2 ] ) is calculated in the fourier space , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "adaptive time stepping is implemented through the cfl stability criterion with the courant number @xmath25 .",
    "we use adaptive anisotropic rectangular grid , which is uniform in each direction and adapted independently along each of the three coordinates .",
    "the idea for the adaption comes from the standard dealiasing rule , optimized for the quadratic nonlinearity of the euler equations . at early times",
    ", the fourier spectrum of the solution is concentrated at low harmonics , while higher harmonics contain numerical noise .",
    "we track the `` signal - noise '' boundary  @xcite until it reaches @xmath26 for any of the three directions @xmath23 .",
    "then we refine the grid along the corresponding direction using the fourier interpolation , which has an error comparable with the round - off .",
    "while the simulation is running in this way , the aliasing error is avoided and the influence of the filtering  ( [ hldumping ] ) on the `` signal - containing '' harmonics is negligible .",
    "we start simulations in cubic grid @xmath27 .",
    "when the total number of nodes reaches @xmath28 , we continue with the fixed grid until the fourier spectrum of the vorticity at @xmath26 exceeds @xmath29 times its maximum value , see  @xcite , along any of the three directions @xmath30 .",
    "we perform simulations of @xmath12 initial flows taken as superpositions of the shear flow @xmath31 and a random periodic perturbation ( different for each initial flow ) @xmath32 . \\label{ic1}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is a vector with integer components @xmath34 , @xmath23 , while vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 of real random coefficients of zero mean and variance @xmath37 satisfy the orthogonality conditions , @xmath38 , necessary for self - consistency .",
    "the shear flow  ( [ ic ] ) is exact stationary solution of the euler equations , with the velocity coinciding with vorticity @xmath39 .",
    "three types of initial conditions are considered :    * type i  generic periodic flows @xmath40 ; * type ii  mix of the shear flow with a random perturbation @xmath41 .",
    "amplitude of the perturbation is adjusted , so that the mix satisfies @xmath42 , @xmath43 ; * type iii  mix of the shear flow with a random perturbation @xmath41 .",
    "amplitude of the perturbation is adjusted , so that the mix satisfies @xmath44 , @xmath45 .    thus , an initial condition of type i is a fully generic periodic flow , type ii  is a mix in proportions similar to @xmath46 of the shear flow with a random flow , and type iii  is the shear flow with a small perturbation . for each type , we tested 10 random realizations of initial flows .",
    "the results are illustrated below for three representative simulations with initial conditions    * @xmath47 ( type i ) , ended at the final time @xmath48 with the grid @xmath49 ; * @xmath50 ( type ii ) , ended at @xmath51 with the grid @xmath52 ; * @xmath53 ( type iii ) , ended at @xmath54 with the grid @xmath55 .    during the simulations , we track evolution of the energy spectrum @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fourier - transformed velocity field and the integral sum",
    "is calculated by summation on spherical shells of unit width @xmath58 .",
    "for some of the initial conditions we observe the gradual formation of the interval of wavenumbers , up to @xmath59 , with the scaling similar to the kolmogorov one , @xmath1 .",
    "this interval is characterized by the `` frozen '' part of the spectrum , in contrast to the vast changes with time at larger wavenumbers , and contains only a small fraction of total energy ( almost all energy is contained in the first harmonic @xmath60 ) .     at @xmath61 for four simulations of @xmath62 initial condition from  @xcite : @xmath63 total number of nodes with hou & li filtering  ( [ hldumping ] ) ( thick green )",

    "first , both the energy @xmath66 and helicity @xmath67 are conserved in our simulations , with the relative error of @xmath68 order .",
    "second , the same energy spectrum is obtained with the cut - off function corresponding to the standard @xmath64-dealiasing rule @xmath69 where @xmath23 .",
    "third , simulations with different grids perfectly converge .",
    "the latter two facts are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , which shows the energy spectrum at @xmath61 for four simulations of @xmath62 initial condition from  @xcite .",
    "the two simulations with fourier filters  ( [ hldumping ] ) and  ( [ 23dumping ] ) , both limited by @xmath63 nodes , reach the final grid @xmath70 only at @xmath71 .",
    "this means that at @xmath61 the aliasing and the filtering have negligible influence on the `` signal - containing '' harmonics for hou & li filtering  ( [ hldumping ] ) , and identically no influence for dealiasing rule filtering  ( [ 23dumping ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the energy spectrum for these simulations practically coincides with that for other two simulations , with the same fourier filters and limited by @xmath28 nodes , which are affected at @xmath61 by both the aliasing and the filtering .",
    "all four simulations demonstrate the identical @xmath65-interval in the energy spectrum , and at @xmath61 have relative point - by - point difference @xmath72 between any two of them @xmath73 and @xmath74 below @xmath75 , with the vorticity changing in the range @xmath76 .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the emergence of the interval in the energy spectrum with the kolmogorov - like scaling is not affected by the specifics of our numerical scheme and should be related to fluid dynamics governed by the euler equations .",
    "we examine the local geometry of a high - vorticity structure using the hessian matrix @xmath77 of second derivatives of vorticity modulus @xmath78 with respect to @xmath79 , computed at the local vorticity maximum .",

    "the characteristic scales are estimated with the local second - order approximation as @xmath81 .",

    ", the span - to - thickness ratio reaches @xmath86 for some of these structures .",
    "the pancakes develop in increasing number and demonstrate a clear tendency for asymptotic exponential vorticity growth @xmath10 and compression in the transversal direction @xmath87 , with the relation @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath88 is the maximum of vorticity within the pancake .",
    "the @xmath64 relation leads to kolmogorov - type scaling between the vorticity maximum and pancake thickness , @xmath89 which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] on the examples of @xmath47 ( type i ) and @xmath53 ( type iii ) initial conditions .",

    "the difference between the three types of initial conditions is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "such a different behavior can not be explained by different spatial resolution of the corresponding simulations : the @xmath53 simulation reaches the stopping condition corresponding to @xmath102 points in @xmath16-axis at @xmath103 , when the power - law interval in the energy spectrum is already developed up to @xmath59 .",
    "note that for a few initial conditions we observe the power - law with a different exponent between @xmath104 and @xmath105 ; however , for most of the simulations this exponent is sufficiently close to @xmath106 .",

    "with 30 new simulations , we systematically verified the key results of our previous study  @xcite , namely , that the regions of high vorticity represent exponentially compressing pancake - like structures , evolving with the scaling @xmath0 between the vorticity maximum and pancake thickness .",
    "collectively , these pancakes provide the leading contribution to the energy spectrum .",
    "note that our paper  @xcite was based on just two simulations .",
    "the initial conditions for the present study were chosen as a combination of the shear flow and a random periodic flow .",
    "such a mix allows one to influence the orientation of the emerging pancake structures , from fully random when the shear flow is absent to almost unidirectional when the perturbation is small .",
    "we observed that fully random initial flows did not develop the power - law interval in the energy spectrum with the exponent independent of time . on the contrary ,",
    "most of the simulations of initial conditions taken as a mix of the shear flow with a small perturbation developed sufficiently long power - law intervals with the scaling similar to the kolmogorov one @xmath1 .    the results of the present paper",
    "demonstrate clearly that the development of the kolmogorov energy spectrum can be influenced by the appropriate choice of initial conditions .",
    "the nature of this influence is yet to be discovered .",
    "the evolution of the energy spectrum is directly related to the development of the high - vorticity pancake structures .",
    "then , different energy spectrum for simulations of different initial conditions may be related to distinctions in ( 1 ) composition of the pancake flows and ( 2 ) distribution of pancakes by scale , orientation and position in the physical space . in our next paper",
    "we are going to present a compelling evidence that the composition of the pancake flows is very similar for all pancakes emerging from all types of initial conditions .",
    "as for the distribution of pancakes by scale , orientation and position , an accurate numerical study in this direction implies the same spatial resolution for different initial conditions .",
    "for initially random periodic flows this means final grids similar to @xmath107 , for a considerable number of independent simulations . at the present moment , these demands exceed our numerical resources , and we plan to continue this study in the future",
