    "continuous wave twin beams owe their popularity to the mutual quantum correlations . it has been shown theoretically ( see f.i .",
    "@xcite ) and proved experimentally ( see f.i .",
    "@xcite ) that this feature can be exploited for replacing classical fields in shot noise limited optical measurements . in particular , the spectrum difference of the two beams is shaped like a lorentzian with a rather good noise suppression at zero frequency . on the other hand , fabre et al",
    "@xcite have called the attention on the squeezing exhibited by each beam for pump intensity larger than four times the threshold value .",
    "they have also shown that additional squeezing can be imposed on each beam by using the photocurrent detected with the other one .",
    "these properties are contrasted by unsuited damping coefficients of the opo cavity , imperfect tuning of the three mode resonances , limited intensity and amplitude / phase fluctuations of the laser pump .",
    "first lane et al .",
    "@xcite drew the attention on the critical dependence of the noise suppression in the difference spectrum on the cavity mismatch , as experimentally confirmed by several authors ( see f.i .",
    "stable and narrow line lasers emit in general low intensity beams .",
    "then , for observing single beam squeezing it is essential to lower the threshold by reducing the pump mode decay rate .",
    "this solution makes the opo a triply resonant device featuring relaxation oscillations @xcite . due to the unavoidable opo crystal losses the amplitude / phase fluctuations of the pump contribute to the difference spectral noise at low frequency , where quantum noise suppression is expected",
    "the situation becomes worse and worse as the cavity is detuned from the resonant configuration .",
    "these few remarks point to the several parameters which the features of an opo depend on , namely , cavity damping coefficients , mismatch of these parameters , degree of excitation above threshold , crystal absorption , deviation from resonance condition ( detuning ) , and pump amplitude / phase fluctuations .",
    "the last ones play a prominent role in the lower part of the frequency spectra of all relevant quantities .",
    "many papers have been published discussing the role of some of these parameters . here",
    "we aim to discuss analytically the twin beam fluctuations by encompassing systematically the many parameters mentioned above .",
    "the representation of the three modes ( signal / idler @xmath0 , @xmath1 , pump @xmath2 ) in the form @xmath3 lends itself to separate the steady state amplitude @xmath4 from the fluctuating relative amplitude @xmath5 and phase @xmath6 in regard to the fluctuations , the opo behaves as a forced linear system .",
    "then , the fourier transforms @xmath7 of the combination @xmath8 and the adjoint @xmath9 form an algebraic system .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath10 on the noise sources is embodied in the frequency responses @xmath11 of the @xmath12-th mode to the @xmath13-th noise source .",
    "these responses are analytic functions of @xmath14 with , all together , six complex poles ( system resonances ) in the half - plane @xmath15 .",
    "their location ( generally complex or purely imaginary )  influences the field correlations in the time domain and , hence , the relative frequency spectra .",
    "for example , when the poles have large real parts the system exhibits relaxation oscillations , responsible of typical peaks in photocurrent spectra . in short",
    "the @xmath16 and their poles provide a link among the opo , pump laser parameters and the statistical features of the twin beams .",
    "while several authors have shown that the unavoidable cavity mismatch reduces the mode correlation , less attention has been paid to the effects of detuning , apart from the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite dedicated to opo with pump bandwidths much larger than the signal / idler ones , i.e. in the adiabatic limit . for large detunings bistability ,",
    "self  pulsing and chaos may appear @xcite , while for moderate deviations from cavity resonance , modifications of the spectra of the single beams and their differences are expected . in presence of detuning",
    "the decay constants become complex , @xmath17 , and the equations of motion of @xmath5 do not separate from those of @xmath18 . in particular , the pump phase diffusion leaks into the single mode amplitude spectrum by enhancing the disturbing effects of the classical pump fluctuations . from the analytic point of view , the detuning has the effect of breaking the symmetry of the frequency responses , @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 and @xmath21 do not commute with the respective quantities at different times .    the model , herein discussed ,",
    "is an extension of the quantum analysis of graham and haken @xcite and fabre et al .",
    "@xcite . in previous works",
    "the variance and covariance of the opo beams have been analyzed by representing the fields either as operators @xcite or classical variables . while reid and drummond @xcite have taken in full account the fluctuating phase factors @xmath22 by using the stochastic equation method , the operator representation has been limited to models neglecting the phase diffusion processes . to fill the gap between these two approaches ,",
    "quantum langevin equations will be used for calculating second and fourth order correlations .",
    "the operator representation offers the advantage of introducing the commutators of the field variables at different times . some of these commutators vanish at resonance , so that their fourier transforms provide an additional signature of the detuning .",
    "essential to these calculations will be the assumption of gaussian statistics of the mode operators .",
    "most of the numerical examples discussed below refer to opo exhibiting relaxation oscillations , that is having pump decay rates comparable with the signal / idler ones .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the basic equations for an opo are reviewed .",
    "the steady state solutions are recalled in sec . 3 , while in sec .",
    "4 it is introduced the linearized set of the equations of motion for the fluctuating parts of the internal modes . then , switching in sec .",
    "5 to the frequency domain , the fourier transforms of the fluctuations are expressed as functions of the noise inputs . moreover ,",
    "the quadratures of the single beams are represented by combinations of the quantum and classical ( pump amplitude and phase ) noise sources times suitable transfer functions .",
    "the system resonances are discussed in sec .",
    "6 by dwelling on the dependence of the pole location on the cavity decay constants and excitation parameter .",
    "eventually , the photocurrent fluctuation spectra are examined in sec . 8 with the help of the transfer functions",
    "@xmath23 discussed in sec .",
    "details on the solution of the algebraic system describing the fluctuations of the opo modes in the fourier domain are given in appendix a and b. the damping coefficients of the opo cavity and the losses of the nonlinear crystal have been indicated respectively by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , by adding an apex for the total losses @xmath26 .",

    "the height of the peak increases notably either with the detuning or by reducing the pump mode bandwidth .",

    "the behavior observed for @xmath343 leads us to conclude that for mode dampings of the same order , the detuning confines the observable squeezing to a small fraction of the twin  beam bandwidth .",
    "moreover , it increases the amplitude of the excess laser noise transferred to the single beam spectrum , thus preventing the reduction below the shot noise level .",
    "the difference spectrum @xmath344 is obtained from @xmath316 by replacing in ( [ contributions ] ) , ( [ spectral - density - commutator ] ) and ( [ external ] ) @xmath345 with @xmath346 @xmath347 and analogously for the residues , @xmath348 and @xmath349 . in particular , the contributions of pump amplitude and phase fluctuations are represented by eqs.([noise - contributions]b , c ) respectively , with @xmath322 and @xmath323 replaced by @xmath350 and @xmath351 , which are in turn defined by equations similar to ( [ contributions]b , c ) with @xmath243 replaced by @xmath352 being the spectral contributions of the laser excess noise and phase diffusion concentrated in the low frequency region , it is worth noting that ( see eq .",
    "( [ low - frequency]-a ) ) @xmath353 so that    @xmath354    these expressions evidence the deleterious effects of crystal losses and detuning also in the difference spectra .",
    "while for a resonant device only the excess noise influences the spectrum , in a detuned device also the phase diffusion contributes to the noise in proximity of the origin .",
    "the plots of fig .",
    "8 show the difference spectrum @xmath344 for an unbalanced resonant opo ( @xmath195 , @xmath332 ) for @xmath355 ( top ) , @xmath334 ( bottom ) .",
    "the peak observed in the single beam spectrum for @xmath356 ( figs . 6 and 7bottom ) is present also in the difference spectrum for the same damping ratio whereas for @xmath296 ( top ) the difference spectrum keeps unchanged its sub  shot  noise character .",
    "the steady - state characteristics of the beams generated by an opo depend on the decay constants of the cavity modes , the non linear crystal losses , the excitation parameter @xmath66 , and the deviation from resonance ( detuning ) .",
    "the last condition has been represented by an angle @xmath67 . while for resonant devices the beam amplitudes are proportional to @xmath357 , in presence of detuning @xmath66",
    "has been replaced by an effective excitation parameter @xmath358 .",
    "similarly , the phase difference between the driving field and the pump mode is a function of the detuning angle @xmath67 .",
    "the effects of these changes propagate to the fluctuating parts of the twin beams amplitudes .",
    "once linearized , the fluctuations of the twin beams are characterized by resonance frequencies which control the frequency responses @xmath359 to the different noise sources ( quantum noise of signal / idler / pump and phase - amplitude fluctuations of the pump laser ) .",
    "these functions have in general six poles @xmath137 in the half plane @xmath15 .",
    "one , @xmath360 , always lies at the origin , a second one , @xmath361 , is located on the positive imaginary axis , while the remaining four ones may be purely imaginary or complex ; when complex ( @xmath362 , @xmath363 ) they are characterized by two damping constants @xmath163 and frequencies @xmath364 .    at resonance",
    "the @xmath365 have only three poles , different from the those of @xmath366 .",
    "their locations in the complex plane depend on the excitation parameter @xmath66 , the cavity damping coefficient @xmath196 at the pump frequency , and the mismatch parameter @xmath194 . for given @xmath194",
    "the couple of parameters @xmath367 corresponding to purely imaginary resonances forms , on the @xmath66@xmath193 plane , a connected region delimited by the straight line @xmath368 and a curve representing the maximum excitation @xmath192 for which the poles are all imaginary . for @xmath193 comprised in a particular interval the poles are imaginary for @xmath369 and @xmath370 . outside this region",
    "the two poles are complex conjugate and the spectrum exhibits a relaxation oscillation peak @xcite .    the amplitude quadrature responses @xmath223 to the various noise terms are regular for @xmath371 , contrariwise to the phase quadratures , @xmath372 and @xmath373 which present a pole . the difficulties of this pole have been bypassed by displacing it from the origin by a small quantity @xmath374 , and letting @xmath375 at the end of the calculations .",
    "so doing the complex fluctuation @xmath376 of each mode emerges as proportional to the annihilation operator @xmath377 of a squeezed thermal oscillator @xmath378 .    by exploiting the gaussian statistics of the fluctuations second and fourth order correlations",
    "have been expressed by suitable combinations of the frequency responses and their residues .",
    "so doing , it has been filled the gap between the evaluation of the variance and covariance of the fields carried out by reid and drummond @xcite by means of classical stochastic equations , limited to resonant and symmetric opo , and that based on quantum langevin equations .",
    "the operator representation offers the opportunity of using the commutators of the field variables at different times for characterizing the respective correlations and gaining further insight in the detuning effects .",
    "in fact , the complex damping coefficients make asymmetric the frequency responses in presence of detuning , @xmath379 , thus implying that @xmath291 and @xmath380 at different times do not commute as does the instantaneous frequency with the phase at the same time @xmath381 .    the detuning interplays with pump excess noise and phase diffusion by increasing the spectral broadening of the twin beams and enhancing the low frequency part of the spectra .",
    "these negative effects are mitigated by a well balanced configuration of the opo .",
    "while triply resonant devices reduce the threshold levels by allowing the investigation of opo quantum properties for large excitation parameters , their spectra differ notably from those typical of the adiabatic regime .",
    "the single beam spectral density starts , for @xmath382 , from below the snl , rapidly increases by reaching a peak in correspondence of the relaxation frequency , and then decays monotonically toward the snl .",
    "the height of the peak increases notably as the pump decay constant decreases with respect to those of the signal / idler .",
    "these oscillations tend to obscure the expected single beam squeezing , by confining it to a low frequency region where the fluctuation spectrum is mostly conditioned by the laser excess noise and phase diffusion .",
