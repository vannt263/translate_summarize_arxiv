    "a mono - layer of graphite sheet , called graphene , has attracted growing interests recently.@xcite graphene exhibits a dirac cone with a linear dispersion at the corner of the first brillouin zone , resulting in a variety of novel transport phenomena of electrons .",
    "they stimulate theoretical and experimental studies taking account of analogy to physics of relativistic electron , such as klein tunneling@xcite and zitterbewegung@xcite .",
    "moreover , semi - infinite graphene and finite stripe of graphene with zigzag edges support a novel edge state with nearly flat dispersion.@xcite on the contrary , armchair edge does not support such an edge state .",
    "the flat dispersion implies that the density of state ( dos ) diverges at the flat band energy , in a striking contrast to the zero dos in bulk .",
    "so far , theoretical investigation of graphene heavily relies on the tight - binding model .",
    "it is not clear to what extent the edge states change in other models on the honeycomb lattice .    here , we study a photonic analog of graphene model,@xcite namely , two - dimensional photonic crystal ( phc ) composed of the honeycomb lattice of dielectric cylinders embedded in a background substance .",
    "the honeycomb lattice consists of two inter - penetrating triangular lattices ( called a and b sub - lattices ) with the same lattice constant . in phc",
    "it is not rare to have the dirac cone in the dispersion diagram .",
    "triangular and honeycomb lattices of identical circular rods support multiple dirac cones at the corner of the first brillouin zone .",
    "it should be noted that they have the same point group of six - fold symmetry .",
    "doubly degenerate modes at the corner of the first brillouin zone exhibit the dirac cone owing to the point group symmetry.@xcite this fact suggests that , the symmetry is crucial and the dirac cone is not limited in the tight - binding model of electrons on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "some perturbation breaks the symmetry of the original honeycomb lattice and causes a crucial influence on the linear dispersion . in electronic systems",
    "the energy difference between a- and b - site atomic orbitals,@xcite periodic magnetic flux of zero average,@xcite and rashba spin - orbit interaction@xcite are such examples of the symmetry breaking .",
    "they break at least either of time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) or space - inversion symmetry ( sis ) or parities in plane .",
    "therefore , the point group of the original honeycomb lattice is reduced into a smaller group . as a result",
    ", the two - dimensional irreducible representations are prohibited , and the doubly - degenerate modes are lifted .",
    "the gap between the lifted modes is correlated with the magnitude of the symmetry breaking . the effective theory around a nearly degenerate point",
    "is described by the massive dirac hamiltonian , where the mass gap can be controlled via the degree of the symmetry breaking .    in the honeycomb lattice",
    "phcs the trs is efficiently broken by applying a magnetic field parallel to the cylindrical axis .",
    "nonzero static magnetic field induces imaginary off - diagonal elements in the permittivity or permeability tensors , through the magneto - optical effect .",
    "the sis is broken if the a - site rods are different from the b - site rods.@xcite therefore , we can continuously tune the degree of the symmetry breaking in the honeycomb lattice phcs .",
    "this tunability is a great advantage of the photonic analog of graphene model and its extension.@xcite from a theoretical point of view , the tight - binding approximation , which is commonly used in modeling of graphene , is not widely applicable for photonic band calculation .",
    "accordingly , the non - bonding orbital in the nearest neighbor tight - binding approximation , which is responsible for flatness of the dispersion curve of the zigzag edge state , is completely absent in phcs .",
    "for example , even in the original honeycomb phc with both the trs and the sis , the dispersion of the zigzag edge states is not flat because of the absence of the non - bonding orbital .",
    "regarding the system with boundary , photonic system is quite distinct from electronic system . in the latter system",
    "the electrons near fermi level are prohibited to escape to the outer region via the work function , _",
    "i.e. _ , a confining potential , and the wave functions of the electrons are evanescent in the outer region",
    ". therefore , to sustain an edge state , formation of the band gap in bulk is the minimum requirement . on the other hand , in the former system confining potentials for photon",
    "are absent at the boundary .",
    "energy of photon is always positive as in free space , and no energy barrier exists between the phc and free space .",
    "the simplest way to confine photonic edge states in the phc is to utilize the light cone .",
    "this restriction of the confinement makes photonic systems quit nontrivial in various aspects .",
    "in particular , the topological relation between bulk and edge@xcite is of high interest in photonic systems without trs . in quantum hall system",
    "nontrivial topology of bulk states leads to the emergence of chiral edge states , which are robust against localization effect .",
    "the edge states play a crucial role in this system.@xcite recently , haldane and raghu proposed one - way light waveguide realized in phcs without trs.@xcite explicit construction of such waveguides is demonstrated by several authors.@xcite this paper also shades light to this topic , by using simpler structure than those demonstrated so far .",

    "the transmittances are the same and nearly equal to zero .",
    "accordingly , no field enhancement is observed near the upper edge ( not shown ) .",
    "the remarkable contrast of the field profiles indicates that the leaky edge state with horizontal energy flow is excited in the left panel , but is not in the right panel .",
    "if the plane wave is incident from the top , the field pattern exhibits an opposite behavior .",
    "that is , the plane wave with @xmath36 and @xmath35 at @xmath83 from the top excites the leaky edge state localized near the upper edge , but at @xmath82 it can not excite the leaky edge state .",
    "the property of each edge state is also understood as follows . when we scan @xmath35 from negative to positive along the dispersion curve of the leaky edge state , the localized center of the edge state transfers from one edge to the other .",
    "the critical point is at the bottom of the dispersion curve , where the edge state merges to the bulk state of the lower band .",
    "it is extended inside the phc , making a bridge from one edge to the other .",
    "the entire picture is consistent with the interchange of @xmath64 and @xmath89 under the inversion of @xmath35 .",
    "finally , let us comment on the field configuration of other edge states .",
    "for @xmath46 and @xmath49 , the edge states are degenerate between the upper and lower edges . accordingly",
    ", the incident plane wave coming from the bottom ( top ) of the structure excites the leaky edge states localized around the bottom ( top ) edge .",
    "it is regardless of the sign of @xmath35 . for @xmath50 and @xmath80 , the edge - state curve that crosses the light line corresponds to an asymmetric peak in the dos , which is actually the sum of two peaks .",
    "it is difficult to separate the two peaks , because they are overlapped in frequency .",
    "thus , the edge states can be excited by the incident wave coming from both top and bottom of the phc . concerning the quadratic edge state around @xmath57 of @xmath80 , a similar contrast in the field configuration between positive and negative @xmath35",
    "is obtained as in @xmath82 and @xmath83 . however , under quenched disorder this edge state readily mixes with bulk states that exist at the same frequency .",
    "the direction of the one - way transport in the zigzag edge is consistent with that in the armchair edge .",
    "let us consider a rectangular - shaped phc whose four edges are zigzag , armchair , zigzag , and armchair in a clockwise order .",
    "the one - way transport found in figs .",
    "[ pband ] and [ pband_armchair ] must be clockwise in this geometry .    to verify it certainly happens",
    ", we performed a numerical simulation of the light transport in the rectangular - shaped phc .",
    "the multiple - scattering method is employed along with a gaussian beam incidence.@xcite we assume @xmath90 for the zigzag edges and @xmath76 for the armchair edges .",
    "the incident gaussian beam is focused at the midpoint of the front armchair edge .",
    "the electric field intensity @xmath72 at the focused point is normalized as 1 and the beam waist is @xmath91 .",
    "the frequency and the incident angle of the beam are taken to be @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which corresponds to the leaky edge state very close to the @xmath82 point .",
    "the beam waist size is chosen to avoid possible diffraction at the corner of the phc and not to excite the states near the @xmath83 point at the same time .",
    "resulting electric field intensity @xmath72 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ onewayconf ] .",
    "( color online ) the electric field intensity @xmath72 induced by the time - harmonic gaussian beam coming from the left of the rectangular - shaped phc .",
    "the four edges are either zigzag ( top and bottom ) or armchair ( left and right ) .",
    "the beam is focused at the mid point of the left armchair edge with the unit electric field intensity and beam waist of @xmath91 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the incident beam is almost reflected at the left ( armchair ) edge , forming the interference pattern in the left side of the phc .",
    "however , as in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ gkedgeconf ] , the leaky edge state is certainly excited there .",
    "this edge state propagates upward , and is diffracted at the upper left corner .",
    "a certain portion of the energy turns into the zigzag edge state localized near the upper edge .",
    "this edge state propagates from left to right .",
    "the energy leakage at the upper edge is very small compared to that in the left and right edges .",
    "this zigzag edge state is more or less diffracted at the upper right corner .",
    "however , the down - going armchair edge state is certainly excited in the right edge .",
    "obviously , the field intensity of the right edge reduces with reducing @xmath94 coordinate .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the energy leakage of the armchair edge state .",
    "finally , the field intensity almost vanished at the lower right corner . in this way",
    ", the clockwise one - way light transport is realized in the rectangular - shaped phc .",
    "we also confirmed that the incident beam with the same parameters but inverted incident angle ( @xmath95 ) does not excite the counterclockwise one - way transport along the edges .",
    "the incident beam is just reflected without exciting the relevant leaky edge state in accordance with the right panel of fig .",
    "[ gkedgeconf ] .",
    "in summary , we have presented a numerical analysis on the bulk and edge states in honeycomb lattice phcs as a photonic analog of graphene model and its extension . in the tm polarization",
    "the dirac cone emerges between the first and second bands .",
    "the mass gap in the dirac cone is controllable by the parameters of the sis or trs breaking . on a certain curve in the parameter space ,",
    "the band touching takes place .",
    "this curve divides the parameter space into two topologically - distinct regions .",
    "one is characterized by zero chern number of the upper and lower bands , and the other is characterized by chern number of @xmath96 . of particular importance is the correlation between the chern number in bulk and light transport near edge .",
    "non - zero chern number in bulk photonic bands results in one - way light transport near the edge .",
    "it is quite similar to the bulk - edge correspondence found in quantum hall systems .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the tm polarization in rod - in - air type phcs .",
    "this is mainly because the band touching takes place between the lowest two bands and they are well separated from higher bands by the wide band gap , provided that the refractive index of the rods are high enough . in rod - in - air type phcs the te polarization results in the band touching between the second and third bands .",
    "however , the dirac cone is not clearly visible , although it is certainly formed . as for hole - in - dielectric type phcs",
    ", an opposite tendency is found .",
    "namely , the band touching between the lowest two bands takes place only in the te polarization . in this case",
    "the distance between the boundary column of air holes and the phc edge affect edge states .",
    "therefore , we must take account of this parameter to determine the dispersion curves of the edge states .    concerning the trs breaking",
    ", we have introduced imaginary off - diagonal components in the permeability tensor .",
    "this is the most efficient way to break the trs for the tm polarization .",
    "such a permeability tensor is normally not available in visible frequency range.@xcite however , in ghz range it is possible to obtain @xmath8 of order 10 .",
    "such a large @xmath8 is necessary to obtain a robust one - way transport against thermal fluctuations , etc . in the numerical setup",
    "we assume an intermediate frequency range with smaller @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , in the te polarization , the trs can be efficiently broken by imaginary off - diagonal components in the permittivity tensor . in this case",
    "the phc without the trs can operate in visible frequency range .",
    "however , strong magnetic field is necessary in order to induce large imaginary off - diagonal components of the permittivity tensor .",
    "thus , it is strongly desired to explorer low - loss optical media with large magneto - optical effect , in order to have robust one - way transport .",
    "recently , another photonic analog of graphene , namely , honeycomb array of metallic nano - particles , is proposed and analyzed theoretically.@xcite particle plasmon resonances in the nano - particles act as if localized orbitals in carbon atom .",
    "the tight - binding picture is thus reasonably adapted to this system , and nearly flat bands are found in the zigzag edge .",
    "vectorial nature of photon plays a crucial role there , giving rise to a remarkable feature in the dispersion curves of the edge states in the quasi - static approximation .",
    "in contrast , vectorial nature of photon is minimally introduced in our model , but a full analysis including possible retardation effects and symmetry - breaking effects has been made .",
    "effects of the te - tm mixing in off - axis propagation are an important issue in our system .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to study to what extent the bulk - edge correspondence is modified .",
    "we hope this paper stimulates further investigation based on the analogy between electronic and photonic systems on honeycomb lattices ."
