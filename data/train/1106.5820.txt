    "the collisions of the lhc @xmath0 tev proton beam with an electron beam with an energy of order @xmath1 gev would provide an extraordinary facility for testing qcd , the electroweak interactions , and theories beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 center of mass energy at the lhec ranges up to @xmath3 tev , about 30 times the cm energy range range of @xmath2 collisions at hera .",
    "if new phenomena such as supersymmetry , the higgs , heavy bosons , new quarks , etc , are discovered in @xmath4 collisions at the lhc in the sub - tev domain , the lhec , with its smaller backgrounds , can be of great importance in illuminating the nature of the new physics .",
    "since quarks , as well as electrons , radiate photons and the @xmath5 and @xmath6 electroweak bosons , the lhec can be considered a vector - boson collider similar in spirit to the proposed ilc @xmath7 collider .",
    "one can study in principle processes such as @xmath8 as well as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc .",
    "the lhec is especially well suited for the production of new heavy quarks @xmath11 in @xmath12 collisions and leptoquark formation in @xmath13 reactions .",
    "it should be recalled that the h1 collaboration  @xcite at hera in fact observed an anomalous number of events in deep inelastic @xmath2 charged- and neutral - current events at @xmath14 gev@xmath15 .",
    "a primary test of qcd is deep inelastic electron - proton scattering @xmath16 if electron scattering at small angles can be detected , the minimum @xmath17 with @xmath18 gev@xmath15 is @xmath19 , about one thousand times smaller than the hera range . in this very small @xmath20 domain",
    "one studies qcd at a high gluon density where saturation , bfkl , and other non - linear physics enter in an essential way .",
    "mueller  @xcite has shown that the power - law behavior of the gluon structure function at small @xmath20 @xmath21 measures the intercept of the bfkl trajectory @xmath22    the maximum momentum transfer of the electron - quark collision which can be studied at the lhec ranges up to 0.9 tev .",
    "in this domain one tests the fundamental scaling of the neutral - current electron - quark interaction resulting from qcd evolution and @xmath23 exchange at a distance scale of order of @xmath24 fm .",
    "similarly , by studying events with missing transverse energy , one can measure the primary weak interaction @xmath25 due to @xmath5 exchange at a momentum transfer @xmath26 as high as @xmath27 events with single top and top pair can be studied .",
    "the collisions of the lhc heavy ion beams with the @xmath1 gev electron beam greatly increases the study of qcd and electroweak interactions in the nuclear domain , processes never measured at hera .",
    "_ diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) _ + the final - state interactions of the struck quark with the spectators  @xcite of the proton in electron - quark collisions lead to diffractive events in deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) at leading twist , such as @xmath28 where the proton remains intact and isolated in rapidity ; in fact , more than 10% of the deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering events observed at hera are diffractive  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a rapidity gap between the target and diffractive system requires that the target remnant emerges in a color - singlet state ; this is made possible in any gauge by the soft rescattering incorporated in the wilson line or by augmented light - front wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "ddis can also be studied in electroweak collisions , especially @xmath29 where again the proton remains intact and isolated in rapidity .",

    "+ one can study exclusive @xmath2 reactions at high photon virtuality particularly deeply virtual compton scattering @xmath30 and its extensions , such as @xmath31 the imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude in the handbag approximation determines the generalized parton distributions of the proton , and thus it is of particular interest . the real part of the dvcs amplitude is determined by the local two - photon interactions of the quark current in the qcd light - front hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this contact interaction leads to a real energy - independent contribution to the dvcs amplitude which is independent of the photon virtuality at fixed @xmath32 .",
    "the interference of the timelike dvcs amplitude with the bethe - heitler amplitude leads to a charge asymmetry in @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "such measurements can verify that quarks carry the fundamental electromagnetic current within hadrons .",
    "_ deeply virtual exclusive meson production and color transparency _ + vector mesons and pseudoscalar mesons can be produced in hard deeply virtual meson scattering reactions : exclusive reactions such as @xmath34 and @xmath35 the distribution amplitude @xmath36 of the meson enters , a fundamental gauge - independent measure of the meson wavefunction . in the case of electron - ion collisions one can study color transparency  @xcite at extreme conditions by checking the @xmath37 dependence of the quasielastic process @xmath38 .",
    "color transparency predicts that the cross section will be linear in the proton number @xmath6 at high @xmath39 ; i.e. , no absorption of the produced vector meson as it traverses the nucleus since it is produced and emerges as a small color singlet .",
    "4 .   _ color - transparent higher - twist direct processes _ + it is conventional to assume that high transverse momentum hadrons in inclusive reactions arise only from jet fragmentation .",

    "a fundamental test of leading - twist qcd predictions in high transverse momentum reactions is the measurement of the power - law fall - off of the inclusive cross section  @xcite @xmath43 at fixed @xmath44 and fixed @xmath45 where @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the correction to the conformal prediction arising from the qcd running coupling and the dglap evolution of the input distribution and fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "the direct higher - twist subprocesses , where the trigger hadron is produced within the hard subprocess avoid the waste of same - side energy , thus allowing the target structure functions to be evaluated at the minimum values of parton momenta where they are at their maximum . + in the case of electron - proton collisions , one can measure @xmath48 or @xmath49 processes where the hadron @xmath50 emerges in isolation .",
    "this reaction is particularly interesting to study in electron - ion collisions at the lhec since the hadron is initially produced as a small - size @xmath51 color - singlet state ; it is  color transparent \"  @xcite , and it can thus propagate through dense nuclear matter with minimal energy loss .",
    "in contrast , the hadrons which are produced from jet fragmentation have a normal inelastic cross section .",
    "+ the power law of the cross section @xmath52 at fixed @xmath53 and @xmath54 can differ from leading - twist predictions due to the presence of higher - twist processes .",
    "the behavior of the single - particle inclusive cross section is thus a key test of qcd at the lhec , since the leading - twist prediction for @xmath55 is independent of the detailed form of the structure and fragmentation functions .",
    "sivers and collins effects _ + the effects of final - state interactions of the scattered quark in deep inelastic scattering have been traditionally assumed to be power - law suppressed .",
    "in fact , the final - state gluonic interactions of the scattered quark lead to a @xmath56-odd non - zero spin correlation of the plane of the lepton - quark scattering plane with the polarization of the target proton  @xcite .",
    "this leading - twist bjorken - scaling  sivers effect \" is nonuniversal since qcd predicts an opposite - sign correlation  @xcite in drell - yan reactions due to the initial - state interactions of the annihilating antiquark .",
    "similarly , the final - state interactions of the produced quark with its comoving spectators produces a final - state @xmath56-odd polarization correlation  the  collins effect . \" .",
    "this can be measured at the lhec without beam polarization by measuring the correlation of the polarization of a hadron such as the @xmath57 with the quark - jet production plane .",
    "the odderon _",
    "+ qcd predicts an odd-@xmath58 exchange trajectory due to diagrams with three - gluon exchange at lowest order , a fundamental effect which has never been verified .",
    "the bfkl analysis predicts that its trajectory has an intercept @xmath59 .",
    "the odderon can be measured in processes requiring odd-@xmath58 exchange such as @xmath60 an even more sensitive test , ideal for the lhec is to measure the difference between the charm and anti - charm angular or energy distributions in @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry arises from the interference of the pomeron and odderon exchange amplitudes .",
    "_ non - universal antishadowing _ + the nuclear distribution can be measured to extraordinarily small @xmath62 in electron - ion collisions at the lhec . +",
    "the shadowing of the nuclear structure functions : @xmath63 at small @xmath64 can be readily understood in terms of the gribov - glauber theory .",
    "consider a two - step process in the nuclear target rest frame .",
    "the incoming @xmath65 dipole first interacts diffractively @xmath66 on nucleon @xmath67 leaving it intact .",
    "this is the leading - twist diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) process which has been measured at hera to constitute approximately 10% of the dis cross section at high energies .",
    "the @xmath65 state then interacts inelastically on a downstream nucleon @xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "the phase of the pomeron - dominated ddis amplitude is close to imaginary , and the glauber cut provides another phase @xmath70 , so that the two - step process has opposite phase and destructively interferes with the one - step dis process @xmath71 where @xmath67 acts as an unscattered spectator .",
    "the one - step and - two - step amplitudes can coherently interfere as long as the momentum transfer to the nucleon @xmath67 is sufficiently small that it remains in the nuclear target ; _ i.e. _ , the ioffe length  @xcite @xmath72 is large compared to the inter - nucleon separation . in effect , the flux reaching the interior nucleons is diminished , thus reducing the number of effective nucleons and @xmath73 the bjorken - scaling diffractive contribution to dis arises from the rescattering of the struck quark after it is struck ( in the parton model frame @xmath74 ) , an effect induced by the wilson line connecting the currents . thus one can not attribute ddis to the physics of the target nucleon computed in isolation  @xcite . +",
    "nuclear shadowing and antishadowing in electron - ion collisions is thus due to multi - step coherent reactions involving leading twist diffractive reactions  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear shadowing of structure functions is a consequence of the lepton - nucleus collision ; it is not an intrinsic property of the nuclear wavefunction .",
    "+ the _ antishadowing _ of the nuclear structure functions as observed in deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering is particularly interesting .",
    "empirically , one finds @xmath75 in the domain @xmath76 ; _ i.e. _ , the measured nuclear structure function ( referenced to the deuteron ) is larger than the scattering on a set of @xmath37 independent nucleons .",
    "+ ivan schmidt , jian - jun yang , and i  @xcite have extended the analysis of nuclear shadowing to the shadowing and antishadowing of the electroweak structure functions .",
    "we note that there are leading - twist diffractive contributions @xmath77 arising from reggeon exchanges in the @xmath32-channel  @xcite .",
    "for example , isospin  non - singlet @xmath78 reggeons contribute to the difference of proton and neutron structure functions , giving the characteristic kuti - weisskopf @xmath79 behavior at small @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath20 dependence of the structure functions reflects the regge behavior @xmath80 of the virtual compton amplitude at fixed @xmath39 and @xmath81 the phase of the diffractive amplitude is determined by analyticity and crossing to be proportional to @xmath82 for @xmath83 which together with the phase from the glauber cut , leads to _ constructive _ interference of the diffractive and nondiffractive multi - step nuclear amplitudes .",
    "the nuclear structure function is predicted to be enhanced precisely in the domain @xmath84 where antishadowing is empirically observed .",
    "the strength of the reggeon amplitudes is fixed by the fits to the nucleon structure functions , so there is little model dependence . since quarks of different flavors will couple to different reggeons ; this leads to the remarkable prediction that nuclear antishadowing is not universal ; it depends on the quantum numbers of the struck quark .",
    "this picture implies substantially different antishadowing for charged and neutral current reactions , thus affecting the extraction of the weak - mixing angle @xmath85 .",
    "the ratio of nuclear to nucleon structure functions @xmath86 is thus process independent .",
    "we have also identified contributions to the nuclear multi - step reactions which arise from odderon exchange and hidden color degrees of freedom in the nuclear wavefunction .",
    "+    + it has been conventional to assume that the nuclear modifications to the structure functions measured in deep inelastic lepton - nucleus and neutrino - nucleus interactions are identical ; in fact , as noted above , the gribov - glauber theory predicts that the antishadowing of nuclear structure functions in the @xmath87 domain is not universal , but depends on the quantum numbers of each struck quark and antiquark  @xcite because of flavor - dependent regge exchange .",
    "this observation can explain the recent analyses of schienbein et al.@xcite and kovarik et al .",
    "@xcite which shows that the measured nuclear effect measured in the nutev deep inelastic scattering charged current experiment is distinctly different from the nuclear modification measured at slac and nmc in deep inelastic scattering electron and muon scattering . see fig.[fignew9 ] .",
    "this implies that part of of the anomalous nutev result  @xcite for @xmath85 could be due to the non - universality of nuclear antishadowing for charged and neutral currents .",
    "+ this nonuniversality can be tested at the lhec in electron - ion collisions by comparing the @xmath37-dependence of deep inelastic neutral and charged current reactions in the @xmath87 domain or by tagging the jet flavor in semi - inclusive dis .",
    "8 .   _ hidden color _",
    "+ in nuclear physics nuclei are simply the composites of nucleons .",
    "however , qcd provides a new perspective :  @xcite six quarks in the fundamental @xmath88 representation of @xmath89 color can combine into five different color - singlet combinations , only one of which corresponds to a proton and neutron .",
    "the deuteron wavefunction is a proton - neutron bound state at large distances , but as the quark separation becomes smaller , qcd evolution due to gluon exchange introduces four other ",
    "hidden color \" states into the deuteron wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the deuteron form factor observed at large @xmath39  @xcite , as well as the presence of two mass scales in the scaling behavior of the reduced deuteron form factor  @xcite , suggest sizable hidden - color fock state contributions in the deuteron wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "the hidden - color states of the deuteron can be materialized at the hadron level as @xmath90 and other novel quantum fluctuations of the deuteron .",
    "these dual hadronic components become important as one probes the deuteron at short distances , such as in exclusive reactions at large momentum transfer .",
    "for example , the ratio @xmath91 is predicted to increase to a fixed ratio @xmath92 with increasing transverse momentum @xmath93 similarly , the coulomb dissociation of the deuteron into various exclusive channels @xmath94 will have a changing composition as the final - state hadrons are probed at high transverse momentum , reflecting the onset of hidden - color degrees of freedom .",
    "the hidden color of the deuteron can be probed at the lhec in electron deuteron collisions by studying reactions such as @xmath95 where the proton and neutron emerge in the target fragmentation region at high and opposite @xmath96 . in principle",
    ", one can also study dis reactions @xmath97 at very high @xmath39 where @xmath98 the production of high @xmath96 anti - nuclei at the lhec is also sensitive to hidden color - nuclear components .",
    "_ heavy quark distributions _",
    "+ it is conventional to assume that the charm and bottom quarks in the proton structure function only arise from gluon splitting @xmath99 in fact , the proton light - front wavefunction contains _ ab initio _ intrinsic heavy quark fock state components such as @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "intrinsic heavy quark fock states in the hadron light - front wavefunction are a rigorous consequence of qcd .",
    "the intrinsic heavy quarks carry most of the proton s momentum since this minimizes the off - shellness of the state .",
    "the heavy quark pair @xmath101 in the intrinsic fock state is primarily a color - octet , and the ratio of intrinsic charm to intrinsic bottom scales scales as @xmath102 as can be seen from the operator product expansion in non - abelian qcd  @xcite .",
    "intrinsic charm and bottom explain the origin of high @xmath103 open - charm and open - bottom hadron production , double charm baryon production , as well as the single and double @xmath104 hadroproduction cross sections observed at high @xmath103 .",
    "the factorization - breaking nuclear @xmath105 dependence of hadronic @xmath104 production cross sections can also be explained  @xcite . + as emphasized by lai , tung , and pumplin  @xcite , there are strong indications that the structure functions used to model charm and bottom quarks in the proton at large @xmath106 have been underestimated , since they ignore intrinsic heavy quark fluctuations of hadron wavefunctions .",
    "furthermore , the neglect of the intrinsic - heavy quark component in the proton structure function will lead to an incorrect assessment of the gluon distribution at large @xmath20 if it is assumed that sea quarks always arise from gluon splitting  @xcite intrinsic heavy quarks in the @xmath107 fock states can account for the magnitude and shape of the proton s @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 distributions  @xcite . +   and @xmath111 cross sections from dzero . from ref .",

    "a similar mechanism could produce the higgs at large @xmath120 in @xmath49 at the lhec based on the mechanism @xmath121 since the heavy quarks typically each carry light - front momentum fractions @xmath122 when they arise from the intrinsic heavy quark fock states @xmath118 of the proton .",
