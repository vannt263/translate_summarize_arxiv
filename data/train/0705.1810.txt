    "bb  peg ( hip  110493 , v = 11@xmath11 , f8v ) is a low - temperature contact binary ( ltcb ) system which was discovered as a variable star in 1931 by hoffmeister .",
    "whitney ( 1959 ) refined the orbital period . since then bb  peg has been the subject of several investigations .",
    "the system was observed photoelectrically in 1978 by cerruti - sola & scaltriti ( 1980 ) , zhai & zhang ( 1979 ) , and awadalla ( 1988 ) .",
    "the times of minima of the system have been published by numerous authors .",
    "cerruti sola , milano & scaltriti ( 1981 ) analyzed the bv light curves of cerruti - sola & scaltriti ( 1980 ) using the wilson - deviney ( wilson & devinney , 1971 ; wilson , 1979 ; hereafter wd ) code .",
    "giuricin , mardirossian & mezzetti ( 1981 ) solved the same light curves using the wood ( 1972 ) model and obtained somewhat different results .",
    "leung , zhai & zhang ( 1985 ) used wd to analyze the bv light curves obtained by zhai & zhang ( 1979 ) .",
    "awadala ( 1988 ) observed ubv light curves but did not perform a light curve analysis .",
    "the mass ratio was determined photometrically for these light curve solutions .",
    "the first radial velocity study of the system done by hrivnak ( 1990 ) gives the mass ratio as 0.34(2 ) .",
    "more recent radial velocity data obtained by lu & rucinski ( 1999 ) result in a mass ratio of 0.360(6 ) . the photometric mass ratio ( 0.360@xmath120.003 ) derived by leung , zhai & zhang ( 1985 ) agrees very well with the spectroscopic value , a result of the total / annular nature of the eclipses ( see terrell & wilson , 2005 ) .",
    "zola et al .",
    "( 2003 ) published the physical parameters of the components .",
    "the orbital period variation was studied by cerruti - sola & scaltriti ( 1980 ) and qian ( 2001 ) .",
    "the photometric observations of the system were obtained with the 0.4-m ( t40 ) , 0.35-m ( t35 ) and 0.30-m telescopes ( t30 ) at the ege university observatory ( euo ) and tbitak national observatory ( tug ) on 8 nights during the observing season between august ",
    "december 2004 with t35 and 2 nights in 2006 with t40 .",
    "however , the system was observed at t30 and t40 for only three night in order to obtain the minima times .",
    "the light curve of the system was obtained from ccd photometry observations .",
    "light curves of bb peg in bessel v and r filters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d and the data are given in table[tab1 ] .",
    "the comparison and check stars were bd@xmath13 and gsc 0168201530 , respectively .",
    "many contact binaries show an asymmetry in which one maximum is higher than the other ( the oconnell effect ) , these asymmetries are usually attributed to spots , which we interpret here in a very general sense : they might be due to large cool star spots , to hot regions such as faculae , to gas streams and their impact on the companion star , or to some inhomogeneities not yet understood ( yakut & eggleton ) . while the asymmetry is apparent in the shape of the light curve of some systems ( e.g. yz phe , samec & terrell 1995 ) , ) , in others this asymmetry may not so prominent .",
    "( e.g , xy leo , yakut et al .",
    "the asymmetry in the light curve of bb  peg is modeled with a cold spot on the secondary component ( the cooler with higher mass and radius ) of the system . in the model of the light curve denoted by m2",
    "the spot activity appears to be prominent with respect to the other models .",
    "the results of the model are summarized in table  [ tab4 ] . besides",
    ", the asymmetry in the light curve is well represented with the model ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a parabolic variation .",
    "therefore , we have applied a parabolic fit , and assume that the mass transfer take place between the components .",
    "the parabolic @xmath14 curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] indicates the existence of mass transfer in the contact system , bb peg .",
    "upward parabolic variation suggesting a mass transfer from the less massive component ( the hotter component in the case of bb peg ) to the more massive one .",
    "( [ bbpeq2 ] ) yields a period increase at a rate of @xmath15days yr@xmath3 .",
    "if the period increase is indeed caused by conservative mass transfer , then one can estimate the mass transfer between the components . using the derived masses",
    ", we derive the rate of mass transfer @xmath16 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 from the less massive to the more massive component as in the conservative mass transfer approximation . however , conservative mass transfer is just an optimistic assumption .",
    "the non - conservative case is very important in close binary evolution ( see for details , yakut & eggleton and references therein ) .",
    "analysis of the data , obtained over approximately 25 years , using the wd program indicate a period increase of @xmath17days / yr , which is close to the one obtained with o - c analysis .",
    "[ fig1]b shows the variation of @xmath18 when the observations extracted from the parabolic variation .",
    "the @xmath19 variations show a sine - like variation , which implies the existence of a tertiary component orbiting bb  peg on an eccentric orbit .",
    "spectroscopic study of the system shows the existence of an m -type dwarf star about the binary ( dangelo et al .",
    "2006 ) . using this information with sine - line variation of the residuals of ( o - c )",
    "we solved the system under the assumption of existence of a third body and obtained the values given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the results of the ( o - c ) analysis show that the third component has a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath20 ) with about a 30-year period . indeed",
    ", ( o - c ) residuals may indicate that the source of this variation could be due to magnetic activity .",
    "the orbit of third body , obtained in this study compared to the data of pribula & rucinski ( 2006 ) appeared to be much more eccentric .    on the other hand , using the values given in table  [ tab3 ] and table  [ tab5 ] one may predict the mass of the tertiary component . by assigning 0.96 au to @xmath21sin@xmath22 and 29.7 yr to period",
    "one can give the mass function as @xmath23 .",
    "for orbital inclinations ( i@xmath24 ) of 90 , 80 , 50 , 30 , 10 the masses of the third body ( @xmath25 ) are estimated to be 0.161 , 0.164 , 0.214 , 0.341 , 1.229 m@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "dangelo et al . ( 2006 ) found a temperature of 3900  k for the tertiary component and a luminosity ratio ( @xmath26 ) of 0.009 . following this information with the deduced luminosities given in this study",
    "one may give the radius of third body as 0.33 r@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath27 relationship is deduced using the ten well - known m - type dwarf stars given in the study of mercedes & ribas ( 2005 ) , then the tertiary body s mass of 0.32 m@xmath2 is found . taking into consideration that value of mass , the orbital inclination of the third body can be found as 35@xmath28 .",
    "useful observations of bb peg throughout the next decade will help to determine the accurate orbital parameters of the third body from the o ",
