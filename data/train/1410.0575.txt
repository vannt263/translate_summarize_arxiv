    "this theory is known to be dual for the @xmath184 superconformal field theory in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "the non - integrability of this background is shown in @xcite by presenting the existence of chaotic string solutions .",
    "the next issue that we would like to consider is deformations of this background by utilizing the yang - baxter sigma model approach .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that it successfully works even for this non - integrable background @xcite .",
    "the point is that , to apply the yang - baxter sigma model description , the parent background needs to be represented by a coset , although it is not necessary to be symmetric .",
    "let us consider the @xmath161 part of the ads@xmath5 background .",
    "the first step to consider cybe - type deformations of @xmath161 is to find out a coset construction .",
    "a five - dimensional sasaki - einstein manifold @xmath161 is represented by a @xmath185-fibration over @xmath186 and it has a coset structure like @xmath187/u(1)$ ] as denoted in @xcite .",
    "this coset description , however , does not leads the correct metric of @xmath161 without suitable rescalings of vierbeins @xcite . for our purpose",
    ", we would like to avoid the rescaling because the dressed @xmath27-operator depends on a group element @xmath112 itself .",
    "in order to overcome this difficulty , we found another coset description of @xmath161 . with this coset , it is not necessary to perform any rescaling so as to obtain the @xmath161 metric .",
    "the coset description we found in @xcite is given by @xmath188 with this description , the manifold obviously has the @xmath189 symmetry , where @xmath190 and @xmath191 correspond to a flavor symmetry and an r - symmetry in the dual gauge theory , respectively . let @xmath144 ( @xmath192 ) be the generators of two @xmath193 s in the denominator . then",
    ", the two @xmath193 s are embedded into the numerator as @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( @xmath166 ) are the generators of the two @xmath197 s , respectively . in particular ,",
    "@xmath198 and @xmath199 are the cartan generators , and @xmath200 is the @xmath201 generator .    by introducing a parameterization of the group element @xmath202 and defining the left - invariant one - form @xmath203 ,",
    "the metric of @xmath161 can be reproduced as @xcite @xmath204 \\nonumber \\\\   & = \\frac{1}{6}\\sum_{i=1,2}(d\\theta_i^2+\\sin^2\\theta_id\\phi_i^2 ) + \\frac{1}{9}(d\\psi+\\cos\\theta_1d\\phi_1+\\cos\\theta_2d\\phi_2)^2\\ , ,     \\label{t11metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coset projector @xmath205 is defined by @xmath206}{{{\\rm str}}[t_1t_1]}t_1 - \\frac{{{\\rm str}}[t_2a]}{{{\\rm str}}[t_2t_2 ] } t_2\\ , .",
    "\\label{proj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one may wonder why the supertrace @xmath78 is adopted here rather than the usual trace .",
    "indeed , the superstrace in is assumed to be taken over the @xmath207 supermatrices , which is the fundamental representation of @xmath189 .",
    "this may be justified by interpreting the matrix as a part of a bigger @xmath208 supermatrix including an @xmath184 superconformal algebra as follows ; @xmath209 the lines in the matrices distinguish the @xmath210-grading . in the right big supermatrix , an @xmath184 superconformal algebra @xmath211 sitting at the four corners together with the supercharges @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "the point is that the @xmath191 symmetry is originated in the superconformal symmetry @xmath211 . in other words ,",
    "the coset should be regarded as a subsector of the supercoset ; @xmath214      we have already revealed the coset structure of @xmath161 .",
    "we are now ready to apply the deformation technique based on classical @xmath2-matrices .",

    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the projector @xmath205 defined in .    as a natural generalization of the s@xmath1 case ,",
    "let us consider an abelian @xmath2-matrix which is composed of the three cartan generators of @xmath216 , @xmath217 with deformation parameters @xmath162 ( @xmath166 ) .    after some computations , the resulting metric and ns - ns two - from turn out to be @xcite @xmath218\\ , ,   \\\\ b_2 & = g(\\hat{\\gamma}_1,\\hat{\\gamma}_2,\\hat{\\gamma}_3)\\bigl [ \\bigl\\{\\hat{\\gamma}_3 \\bigl(\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta_1\\sin^2\\theta_2}{36 } + \\frac{\\cos^2\\theta_1\\sin^2\\theta_2+\\cos^2\\theta_2\\sin^2\\theta_1}{54}\\bigr){\\nonumber}\\\\ & \\hspace{33 mm } -\\hat{\\gamma}_2 \\frac{\\cos\\theta_2\\sin^2\\theta_1}{54 } -\\hat{\\gamma}_1 \\frac{\\cos\\theta_1\\sin^2\\theta_2}{54 }   \\bigr\\}d\\phi_1\\wedge d\\phi_2 { \\nonumber}\\\\ & \\quad   + \\frac{(\\hat{\\gamma}_3\\cos\\theta_2-\\hat{\\gamma}_2)\\sin^2\\theta_1}{54}d\\phi_1\\wedge d\\psi   -\\frac{(\\hat{\\gamma}_3\\cos\\theta_1-\\hat{\\gamma}_1)\\sin^2\\theta_2}{54}d\\phi_2\\wedge d\\psi   \\bigr]\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the scalar function is defined as @xmath219 indeed , these expressions agree with the ones obtained in @xcite via tst - transformations .",
    "in particular , when @xmath220 and @xmath221 is non - zero , the above deformed backgrounds reduce to the lunin - maldacena case @xcite .",
    "in this article , we have given a short review of the recent progresses on novel relations between classical @xmath2-matrices satisfying the cybe and deformed string backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the relations are worthy of being called the _",
    "gravity / cybe correspondence _ @xcite .",
    "according to them , the solution space of the cybe may be regarded as a moduli space of a certain class of deformed gravitational backgrounds . in particular , we have presented several important examples including three parameter @xmath162-deformations of the s@xmath1 part @xcite and the gravity duals of non - commutative @xmath6 super yang - mills theories @xcite in section [ sec : cybetograv ] .",
    "we have also discussed an application of the deformation technique to a non - integrable background , ads@xmath5 @xcite in section [ sec : t11 ] .",
    "there remain , however , several open questions to be answered .",
    "let us list some of them in the following ;    * firstly , we are not sure whether or not any deformed backgrounds obtained by classical @xmath2-matrices are consistent with the equations of motion of type iib supergravity .",
    "even though we proved that the deformed models have kappa - symmetry in general @xcite and some important deformed supergravity backgrounds are successfully obtained as demonstrated in section [ sec : cybetograv ] , it is not straightforward to conclude that the resulting backgrounds always satisfy the equations of motion of type iib supergravity .",
    "* it is not obvious that mutually different @xmath2-matrices label pair - wise different backgrounds .",
    "it is observed in @xcite that two non - equivalent @xmath2-matrices lead to the identical metric , up to coordinate transformations .",
    "thus , to establish the one to one correspondence between @xmath2-matrices and deformed backgrounds , it would be necessary to take into account an appropriate quotient by algebra automorphisms .",
    "* can we find the corresponding @xmath2-matrix for a given deformed background ?",
    "more generally , does there alway exist an @xmath2-matrix for any analytically deformed ads@xmath0s@xmath1 background ?",
    "even though we know how to compute the deformed back metric and the ns - ns two - forms from the @xmath2-matrices , the inverse direction should also be clarified . * finally , it is desirable to figure out the composite rule of the @xmath2-matrices . on the gravity theory side ,",
    "some deformed backgrounds are obtained by string dualities such as tst - transformations and we could think of a chain of them to construct more complicated backgrounds . in this sense , we have a structure of product of the dualities .",
    "the question is how it works for the classical @xmath2-matrices if the gravity / cybe correspondence holds .",
    "we expect that the twist operator discussed in section [ sec : twist ] might be a clue to solve this problem .",
    "even though there are still many issues to establish the gravity / cybe correspondence , we believe that classical @xmath2-matrices are very fascinating objects to characterize deformed gravity solutions . as a final remark ,",
    "the deformation technique presented here preserves the classical integrability of the undeformed background , but it can describe a non - integrable deformation of a non - integrable background , ads@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the gravity / cybe correspondence is not restricted to a class of integrable backgrounds and capture a wider class of gravity solutions .",
    "it is an important task to ascertain the limitation of this scenario .",
    "we hope to report on some new results along this direction in the near future .",
    "we are grateful to gleb arutyunov , riccardo borsato , takashi kameyama and stefan vandoren for valuable comments and discussions .",
