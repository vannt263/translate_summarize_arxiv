    "<S> motivated by the formal argument that a non - zero shear modulus is the result of averaging over a constrained configurations space , we demonstrate that the shear modulus calculated over a range of temperatures and averaging times can be expressed ( relative to its infinite frequency value ) as a single function of the mean squared displacement . </S>",
    "<S> this result is shown to hold for both a glass - liquid and a crystal - liquid system .    </S>",
    "<S> glasses are rigid and liquids are not . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty with any distinction of two phases based solely on rigidity is that the property is not an equilibrium one . over 45 years ago , </S>",
    "<S> lebowitz@xcite and ruelle@xcite pointed out that , in the thermodynamic limit , the free energy of a phase can not depend on the shape of the sample and so the equilibrium value of the shear modulus must vanish for all phases @xmath0 crystals as well as glasses @xmath0 in the limit of large n. rationalising the obvious point that rigid materials do in fact exist , a number or researchers@xcite have concluded that a non - zero shear modulus is a property of a metastable state and hence rigidity is observable only for observation times shorter than the lifetime of that state . </S>",
    "<S> since the observation of a non - zero shear modulus depends crucially on this lifetime , it would seem that any theoretical treatment of the mechanical properties of a material will depend on solving the onerous problem of slow relaxation in a condensed phase . </S>",
    "<S> williams and evans@xcite , acknowledging this difficulty , suggested that the shear modulus be formally calculated as an equilibrium average over a constrained space of configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this perspective suggests the attractive possibility that the magnitude of the shear modulus might be expressed as an explicit function of the magnitude of the configurational constraint applied , a relation that includes a threshold degree of constraint , below which rigidity vanishes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we establish just such a relationship between the shear modulus and the configurational constraint , measured here by the mean squared displacement , for both a glass - liquid and crystal - liquid system .    </S>",
    "<S> the squire - holt - hoover expression@xcite for the ( constrained ) equilibrium shear modulus @xmath1 of a solid is @xmath2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the shear stress , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is volume and @xmath6 is the infinite frequency ( or born ) shear modulus given by@xcite @xmath7   -\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dr_{ij}^2 } \\frac{x_{ij}^2 y_{ij}^2}{r_{ij}^2 }   \\big ) > \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a spherically symmetric inter - particle potential . note that the shear modulus @xmath1 is reduced , relative to the high frequency value , by an amount associated with variance of the shear stress fluctuations . in the context of elastic theory , these fluctuations correspond to non - affine contributions to the modulus@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what is measured in a typical experiment is the stress relaxation function @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a applied strain and @xmath12 is the resulting time dependent shear stress . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath1 is given by the following expression@xcite , @xmath14\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the shear stress autocorrelation function @xmath15 equals @xmath16 when t=0 and @xmath17 in the limit @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from eq . </S>",

    "<S> the model liquid used in this study is a 2d system of soft disks with a pair interaction potential , @xmath24 , between species @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the case of the binary equimolar mixture we use @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 and all particle with unit mass , a model that has been extensively studied@xcite in the context of the glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is reported in units of @xmath30 and time in units of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> simulations were carried out under constant nvt conditions using lammps@xcite with a nose - hoover thermostats at reduced densities @xmath32 ( binary mixture ) and @xmath33 ( single component ) with a potential cut - off distance of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the system consisted of a total of n = 1024 particles in the case of the binary mixture and @xmath35 for the single component system . </S>",
    "<S> previously@xcite , we established that these values of n were sufficient for accurate calculation of the stress fluctuations . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the trajectories are non - ergodic for all accessible values of the averaging time @xmath36 . in order to fairly sample the configuration space at these low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> we have averaged trajectories over statistically distinct initial configurations . for the binary mixtures , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 uncorrelated configurations were generated by cooling a liquid , equilibrated at @xmath38 , to @xmath39 at a cooling rate of @xmath40 and then minimizing the potential energy of the resulting @xmath41 liquid by conjugate gradient minimization . </S>",
    "<S> the minima , referred to as inherent structures ( is ) , were statistically independent as established by the average shear stress ( at @xmath42 ) of the inherent structures equalling zero . to calculate @xmath1 and @xmath6 at a given temperature @xmath43 we randomly assigned momenta from the boltzmann distribution consistent with a temperature @xmath43 to the particles in each of the n is configurations and then determined the moduli for each individual is using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> 1and 2 , respectively , by averaging over a trajectory run for a time interval t. to obtain our final values of @xmath1 and @xmath6 , we averaged the moduli for the individual is configurations over all @xmath37 is configurations . in the case of the single component system , </S>",
    "<S> this protocol was modified as follows . for the crystal phase we only used a single inherent structure , that of the perfect crystal . for the liquid phase data we simply carried out averages over md trajectories of the equilibrated liquid .     </S>",

    "<S> note the significant effect of the averaging time in the case of @xmath1 in contrast to @xmath6 , were the influence of averaging time has saturated within a short time @xmath44 . </S>",

    "<S> we find that @xmath6 increases linearly with @xmath43 and shows no significant variation with the averaging time t. ( note that the infinite frequency modulus referred to experimentally is not @xmath6 but the value of @xmath13 in the plateau region . ) </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium modulus @xmath1 , in contrast , exhibits a strongly nonlinear decrease with increasing temperature , to finally vanish at a sufficiently high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the family of curves presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 is evidence of the significance of the time t used to calculate the statistics of the stress fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of papers@xcite have discussed the loss of rigidity of a glass as characterised by the disappearance of @xmath1 on heating in the context of a possible thermodynamic instability , analogous to the softening in a superheated crystal@xcite , or as an un - jamming transition associated with the thermal expansion of the amorphous solid@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( we remind the reader that our calculations have been carried out at fixed density so that this latter proposal is not directly relevant here . ) </S>",
    "<S> while the role of the observation time is discussed@xcite , it is the temperature that is treated as the essential control parameter for the transition . following on from our opening discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we shall explore the idea that this decrease of the equilibrium shear modulus , either through increasing t or the observation time , is most fundamentally expressed as a result of the changing degree of configurational constraint associated with the averaging .    to begin we note that temperature dependence of @xmath6 is not associated with configurational constraint since , by construction </S>",
    "<S> , the infinite frequency modulus depends only on the sampling of the local curvature of the potential energy surface . the increase in @xmath6 with temperature at constant volume demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b is directly associated with the increase of the virial pressure with t under the constant volume constraint ( see insert fig .   </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . to eliminate this additional temperature dependence we shall therefore consider the reduced modulus @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> next , we need a measure of the configurational constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest such measure is the particle mean squared displacement , @xmath48 where the time @xmath36 here is the same as the observation time used to calculate the stress averages and , in the case of a binary mixture , the average is over both species .     </S>",
    "<S> vs @xmath49 for the binary mixture . in each case , the mean squared displacement is calculated over the same time interval as that use to evaluate @xmath1 . ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we plot @xmath47 vs @xmath49 where we have used the data from fig .  1 for a range of temperatures and observation times . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all of the data from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 collapses onto a single curve . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides strong support the twin propositions of this paper , i.e. that the ( reduced ) shear modulus is simply a consequence of configurational constraint and that the mean squared displacement provides a useful measure of this constraint .     and @xmath49 ( both averaged over a time @xmath50 ) for the single component 2d soft disk system . </S>",
    "<S> due to the constant density constraint , there is a range of temperatures corresponding to a two phase coexistence , indicated by the two vertical dashed lines . </S>",
    "<S> the freezing transition is marked by step - like change in the modulus and the mean squared displacement . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a glass forming liquid is convenient for our purposes because it can access the entire range of @xmath1 without encountering a thermodynamic singularity . </S>",
    "<S> our argument relating shear modulus and configurational constraint , however , should apply equally to crystallizing liquids . to demonstrate this point </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a single component soft disk liquid in 2d which crystallizes readily into a triangular lattice . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we plot the values of @xmath1 and @xmath49 for the system as a function of @xmath43 , using an observation time @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the @xmath52 order freezing at @xmath53 is clearly evident in both quantities . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 we plot @xmath47 vs @xmath49 for a range of temperatures ( using crystal and liquid configurations for @xmath43 below and above @xmath54 , respectively ) and a range of observation times . </S>",
    "<S> again , we find the data collapsed onto a common curve , this in spite of the discontinuity of the modulus and @xmath49 with respect to temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting the striking difference in the low @xmath43 limit of @xmath47 for the crystal ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) and the glass ( fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the considerable softening of the glass relative to @xmath6 even at @xmath42 is due to ( i ) the higher density of crystal and ( ii ) the large non - affine motions@xcite in the glass relative to those in the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of non - affine motions in the amorphous phase and their effective absence in the crystal is due to the absence of inversion symmetry in the local structure of the amorphous phase and its presence in the crystal@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the reduced shear modulus @xmath47 on @xmath49 is found , empirically , to be well described by the following relation , @xmath55    \\big)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the success of this function is shown in fig .  5 for the glass forming mixture with the fitted values @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> .  5 also provides an excellent fit to @xmath47 vs @xmath49 for both the crystal and liquid phases of the single component system ( see fig .  4 ) , but with different parameters , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> viewed as an emergent property of restricted particle fluctuations , the derivation of the dependence of @xmath47 on the degree of configurational constraint must represent a problem of fundamental importance .     </S>",
    "<S> on @xmath49 for the single component crystal and liquid . as for fig .  2 , each point corresponds to a choice of @xmath43 and the averaging time . </S>",
    "<S> liquid state data i.e. @xmath60 are presented by filled symbols and crystal data by open symbols . </S>",
    "<S> the curve corresponds of a fit of eq .  5 to the single component data with @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> ]    we have argued here that the value of @xmath1 ( relative to @xmath6 ) is a consequence of constraint . </S>",
    "<S> this is the opposite to the account provided within harmonic models of solids in which the elastic constants ( or the bond force constants ) are prescribed in the model and the mean squared displacement are determined as a consequence . </S>",
    "<S> this latter treatment , however , is only possible because of the implicit configurational constraints ( i.e. assumed elasticity , unbreakable harmonic bonds , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> on which such models rely . for the harmonic solid , @xmath61 ( at fixed density ) . as shown in fig .  5 ( insert ) </S>",
    "<S> , this relation holds only for @xmath62 , a result that underscores the inclusion of anharmonic effects in the empirical relations demonstrated in fig .  4 and 5 . </S>",
    "<S> yoshino and zamponi@xcite have recently derived a power law relationship between the shear modulus and the mean squared displacement in a granular model that applies within a metabasin , a restricted range of configuration space corresponding , roughly , to @xmath63 .     </S>",
    "<S> vs @xmath49 for the binary mixture . </S>",
    "<S> ( the correspondence between symbols and temperatures are the same as in fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the expression in eq .  5 ( solid curve ) provides a good description over the entire range of @xmath49 with @xmath64 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> insert : the quantity @xmath65 vs @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic approximation , indicated by a constant value ( dashed line ) , breaks down for @xmath66 . ]    in conclusion , we have verified that our two propositions : ( 1 ) the degree of configurational constraint determines the magnitude of the shear modulus ( relative to the low temperature limit ) , and ( 2 ) the mean squared displacement provides a useful measure of this constraint , do indeed represent a consistent physical picture for both a glass forming liquid and one that undergoes freezing . </S>",
    "<S> this result represents a fundamental unification of the physical basis of rigidity . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a non - zero shear modulus is not , we argue , the consequence of a low temperature , a high frequency measurement or even the presence of long range order . </S>",
    "<S> rather , each of these factors is important only in as far as they contribute to an implicit constraint on the volume of configuration space that can be explored by stress fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> it is this constraint , however it is achieved , that determines the value of the equilibrium shear modulus . </S>",
    "<S> this is a powerful result with a number of interesting consequences . </S>",
    "<S> first , accounts of the temperature dependence of the shear modulus of metallic glasses@xcite have relied on the language of anharmonic effects borrowed from crystal physics . in the picture we present here , </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in the glass modulus on heating is associated the increase in @xmath49 by harmonic or anharmonic motions ( along with any decrease in @xmath6 associated with thermal expansion when a constant pressure is employed as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , we have argued that the shear modulus should be regarded as a mechanical manifestation of restricted motion . </S>",
    "<S> couple this idea with a description of the role that elastic behaviour plays in determining the rate of particle motion ( e.g. the shoving model of dyre@xcite ) and there is possibility of a self consistent theory in which the modulus is , itself , a consequence of the very particle mobilities that it acts to constrain . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , these results suggest a reassessment of the empirical lindemann criterion@xcite , i.e. the observation that crystal order is lost once the mean squared displacement exceeds some threshold value . </S>",
    "<S> our results here suggest that it is rigidity , not structure _ per se _ , that vanishes as the mean square displacement increases . finally , since our account of rigidity places no special condition on how the configuration space is accessed it is possible that non - thermal contributions to particle mobility such as the non - affine motion due to applied strain should result in an analogous reduction in @xmath47@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each of these lines of inquiry is currently under investigation .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have established that the collection of factors @xmath0 time , temperature and order @xmath0 associated with the observation of rigidity in a dense phase can be replaced by a single tangible length that characterizes the degree of configurational constraint . while we have established that @xmath49 provides a workable measure of this constraint length , further work is required to establish whether there is a better measure of this constraint and whether we can derive from first principles the mathematical relationship between this measure and the shear modulus . </S>"
