    "efimov showed that there are infinitely many three - body bound states with an accumulation point at zero energy in the _ unitary limit _ of infinite scattering length ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the ratio of the binding energies of two successive bound states approaches a universal number @xmath2 as one approaches the threshold .",
    "the efimov effect also has important consequences for finite scattering length .",
    "in particular , it provides the starting point for a systematic effective field theory description of few - body observables when the two - body scattering length @xmath0 is much larger than the range @xmath3 of the underlying interaction .",
    "the effective field theory approach allows then to include the corrections due to the finite range of the interaction perturbatively .",
    "a more detailed discussion of these aspects can be found in the reviews by braaten & hammer ( 2006 ) and platter ( 2009 ) .",
    "the efimov effect has recently received a significant amount of attention since modern experimental techniques have allowed to demonstrate its existence in systems that have a large scattering length .",
    "in particular , the ability to tune the scattering length in experiments with ultracold atoms has allowed to demonstrate the discrete scaling symmetry by measuring atom loss rates in ultracold gases ( ferlaino & grimm 2010 ) .",
    "the efimov effect plays also an important role in nuclear physics ( hammer & platter 2010 ) .",
    "the nuclei @xmath4h and @xmath4he can be considered ground states of an efimov spectrum with only one state .",
    "some halo nuclei , which consist of a tightly bound core and a halo of weakly bound nucleons , are also candidates for efimov states .    the renormalization group ( rg ) provides a powerful method to understand the physics associated with the efimov effect .",

    "the renormalization group ( rg ) is one of the most important developments in modern physics ( wilson 1983 ) .",
    "the rg has been particularly important for the understanding of _",
    "critical phenomena_. this term is used to describe universal behavior in second order phase transitions .",
    "near a _ critical point _",
    "certain thermodynamic observables show power law behavior .",
    "this power law behavior at the critical point implies scale invariance of the system .",
    "for example , the correlation length @xmath5 diverges as @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the critical temperature and @xmath9 is a _",
    "critical exponent_. as a consequence , the system looks the same at all distance scales .",
    "the critical exponents are the same for systems in the same _ universality class_. an example of two such systems in the same universality class are liquid - gas systems and a ferromagnet with one easy axis of magnetization .",
    "even though their dynamics at short distances is very different , they share the same critical exponents . from the perspective of the renormalization group ,",
    "this scaling behavior is characterized by a fixed point .",
    "such fixed points also play an important role in quantum field theories in particle physics .",
    "asymptotically free theories like quantum chromodynamics , e.g. , have an ultraviolet fixed point that corresponds to zero coupling ( gross & wilczek 1973 ; politzer 1973 ) .    in order to understand the concept of renormalization group fixed points",
    ", it is convenient to expand the hamiltonian @xmath10 governing the system in a basis of operators @xmath11 @xmath12 we refer to the basis coefficients @xmath13 as the coupling constants of the hamiltonian .",
    "a particular hamiltonian is represented by a point @xmath14 in the infinite dimensional vector space .",
    "if we now introduce an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath15 , an rg transformation is defined as a transformation that eliminates short - distance degrees of freedom ( lowers the cutoff @xmath15 ) while the long - distance observables remain unchanged .",
    "we treat the cutoff @xmath15 as a continuous variable and the rg transformation defines thus a flow in the space of coupling constants .",
    "this flow can be expressed through a differential equation for the coupling @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the _ beta function_. this equation can be used to define the concept of a fixed point .",
    "a fixed point @xmath19 in the space of coupling constants fulfills @xmath20 wilson discovered that scale invariant behavior at long distances is a result of a fixed point in the infrared limit @xmath21 ( infrared fixed point ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath22 remains then invariant under a change of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath15 . since @xmath15 defines the length scale of the system , the system is therefore scale invariant at the fixed point .",
    "equation can be linearized in the vicinity of a fixed point @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a linear operator .",
    "the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath24 are the critical exponents . operators with positive , zero and negative critical exponents are called relevant , marginal and irrelevant operators , respectively .",
    "relevant operators become more important for large @xmath15 , while irrelevant operators become less important .",
    "marginal operators are a special case and higher order corrections are important to decide their fate .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath9 in eq .",
    "is related to the critical exponent of an appropriate operator in the hamiltonian .",
    "another solution to eq .",
    ", corresponds to a _",
    "limit cycle_. in this case the rg trajectory flows around a closed loop in the space of coupling constants .",
    "a limit cycle can be understood as a family of hamiltonians @xmath25 that is closed under the rg flow and can be parameterized by an angle @xmath26 that runs from 0 to @xmath27 .",
    "all coupling constants in the hamiltonian @xmath10 will return to their initial value once the cutoff is changed by a factor @xmath28 ( the _ preferred scaling factor _ ) : @xmath29 a necessary condition for a limit cycle is invariance under discrete scale transformations : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is an integer .",
    "this discrete scaling symmetry is reflected in log - periodic behavior of physical observables . with a single coupling constant ,",
    "a limit cycle can only occur if the coupling has discontinuities .",
    "if this is the case , the rg equation has two complex conjugate fixed point solutions , see e.g. ( moroz & schmidt 2010 ) . the preferred scaling factor @xmath28 is then determined by the imaginary part of the fixed point coupling .",
    "the possibility of rg limit cycles was first discussed by wilson in a work that applied the concepts of the renormalization group to the strong interactions of elementary particle physics ( wilson 1971 ) .",
    "the efimov effect can be understood in terms of a renormalization group limit cycle with discrete scaling factor @xmath32 ( albeverio _ et al .",
    "_ 1981 ) . in the limit @xmath33",
    ", there is an accumulation of three - body bound states near threshold with binding energies differing by multiplicative factors of @xmath34 ( efimov 1970 ) . in the effective field theory formulation of bedaque _",
    "( 1999 ) , the limit cycle becomes explicit in the running of the leading - order three - body contact interaction required for renormalization .",
    "a renormalization group analysis of the three - body problem was carried out by barford & birse ( 2005 ) .",
    "we will use the quantum mechanical @xmath35 potential as an example that exhibits both fixed point and limit cycle solutions .",
    "our discussion follows kaplan _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) and hammer & swingle ( 2006 ) .",
    "consider the three - dimensional schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath36 @xmath37 where we have set @xmath38 for convenience , such that @xmath39 is dimensionless .",
    "this potential is scale invariant at the classical level .",
    "rescaling all distances by a factor @xmath40 and rescaling time by a factor of @xmath41 leaves the hamiltonian invariant up to a constant prefactor @xmath42 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the @xmath43-wave solution to the schrdinger equation for @xmath44 and zero energy is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 if either @xmath47 or @xmath48 , this solution is scale invariant .",
    "we can identify the solution @xmath47 with an infrared fixed point and the solution @xmath48 with an ultraviolet fixed point .",
    "formally , one can pick the desired solution by adding a counterterm potential with coupling constant @xmath49 to the hamiltonian .",
    "this is equivalent to putting a boundary condition on the wave function at short distances .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath49 satisfies an rg equation with a @xmath50-function that takes the form ( kaplan _ et al .",

    "is now broken to a discrete scaling symmetry by quantum fluctuations at small distances .",
    "this symmetry breaking can be interpreted as a quantum mechanical anomaly ( ananos _ et al .",
    "the discrete scaling symmetry is manifest in observables such as in the geometric bound state spectrum @xmath62 as well as the log - periodic dependence of the @xmath43-wave scattering phase shift @xmath63 and the corresponding cross section on the momentum @xmath64 .",
    "in 1970 , efimov analyzed the three - nucleon system interacting through zero - range interactions .",
    "this system had been considered before , but he was the first one to realize that one should not focus on the pathologies at large energies but on the universal physics at low energies , @xmath65 . in this limit , where zero - range forces are adequate , he found some surprising results ( efimov 1970 ) .",
    "he pointed out that when @xmath66 is sufficiently large compared to the range @xmath3 of the potential , there is a sequence of three - body bound states whose binding energies are spaced roughly geometrically in the interval between @xmath67 and @xmath68 . as @xmath66 is increased , new bound states appear in the spectrum at critical values of @xmath0 that differ by multiplicative factors of @xmath69 , where @xmath70 depends on the statistics and the mass ratios of the particles . in the case of spin - doublet neutron - deuteron scattering and for three identical bosons , @xmath70 is the solution to the transcendental equation @xmath71 its numerical value is @xmath72 and the preferred scaling factor is @xmath73 as @xmath74 , the asymptotic number of three - body bound states is @xmath75 equation expresses the fact that in any system with a finite range , the number of efimov states is bounded from above due to the finite range of the interaction . since efimov s approach requires the scattering length @xmath0 to be significantly larger than the range of the interaction @xmath3 , efimov states must have binding energies smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "the three - nucleon systems @xmath4h or @xmath4he contain therefore only one efimov state which is also the ground state . in the limit @xmath33 , there are infinitely many three - body bound states with an accumulation point at the three - body scattering threshold with a geometric spectrum : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the mass of the particles and @xmath79 is the binding wavenumber of the branch of efimov states labeled by @xmath80 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : efimovplot ] ) .",
    "the geometric spectrum in ( [ kappa - star ] ) is the signature of a discrete scaling symmetry with scaling factor @xmath81 .",
    "it is independent of the mass or structure of the identical particles and independent of the form of their short - range interactions .",
    "the efimov effect can also occur in other three - body systems if at least two of the three pairs have a large s - wave scattering length but the numerical value of the asymptotic ratio may differ from the value @xmath82 .     versus the inverse scattering length @xmath83 .",
    "the solid lines denote some of the infinitely many branches of efimov states while the cross - hatching indicates the threshold for scattering states .",
    "either one of the quantities @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath79 can be used to specify the branch labelled with @xmath86 .",
    "all other states follow from the discrete scaling symmetry .",
    ", width=302 ]    a formal proof of the efimov effect was subsequently given by amado and noble ( amado & noble 1971 , 1972 ) .",
    "the thomas and efimov effects are closely related .",
    "the deepest three - body bound states found by thomas variational calculation can be identified with the deepest efimov states ( adhikari _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) .    the universal properties in the three - body system with large scattering length are not restricted to the efimov effect .",
    "the dependence of three - body observables on the scattering length is characterized by scaling behavior modulo coefficients that are log - periodic functions of @xmath0 ( efimov 1971 , 1979 ) .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of a system with a discrete scaling symmetry .",
    "we will refer to universal aspects associated with a discrete scaling symmetry as efimov physics .    in 1981",
    ", efimov proposed a new approach to the low - energy few - nucleon problem in nuclear physics that , in modern language , was based on perturbation theory around the unitary limit ( efimov 1981 ) .",
    "remarkably , this program works reasonably well in the three - nucleon system at momenta small compared to @xmath87 .",
    "it has been used as the basis of an effective field theory for nuclear physics at very low energies ( bedaque & van kolck 2002 ; epelbaum _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) .",
    "efimov formulated the three - body problem using hyperspherical coordinates that are particularly well - suited for the analysis of few - body problems in coordinate space . in this approach ,",
    "the 6 independent coordinates of the problem are given by the hyperradius and 5 angles .",
    "the hyperradius @xmath88 is defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the separation between atoms @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it is only small if all three particles are close together .",
    "efimov showed that in these coordinates the three - body problem with a large scattering length reduces to a simple schrdinger - like equation with a @xmath93 potential . at short distances ,",
    "the problem simplifies and the radial equation takes the form @xmath94 as discussed in the previous section , the @xmath93 potential requires a boundary condition on the wave function at short distances if the potential is sufficiently attractive .",
    "this boundary condition , which alternatively can be expressed through a short - range three - body force ( bedaque _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , can be fixed from any three - body observable .",
    "in practical applications to the three - nucleon system , one uses either the spin - doublet neutron - deuteron scattering length or the triton binding energy as three - body input .",
    "if the deuteron binding energy and the spin - singlet scattering length are used as two - body input and if the boundary condition is fixed using the spin - doublet neutron - deuteron scattering length , the triton binding energy is predicted with an accuracy of 6% ( bedaque _ et al .",
    ". the accuracy of the predictions can be further improved by taking into account the effective range as a first - order perturbation ( efimov 1991 ) .",
    "thus , the triton can be identified as an efimov state associated with the deuteron being a @xmath95 bound state with large scattering length ( efimov 1981 ) .    the effective coupling of the potential in eq .",
    "@xmath96 is smaller than @xmath97 .",
    "this implies that the renormalization group flow of the counterterm introduced for regularization of the problem will display limit cycle behaviour .",
    "this limit cycle has important consequences for observables .",
    "for example in the unitary limit the binding energies scale as given in eq .  .",
    "for finite scattering length , observables such as binding energy and cross sections still scale with integer powers of @xmath98 under this symmetry .",
    "for example , the binding energy of an efimov trimer which is a function of @xmath0 and @xmath79 scales @xmath99 this implies for positive scattering length @xmath100 the function @xmath101 parameterizes the scattering length dependence of all efimov trimers exactly in the limit of vanishing range .",
    "the function @xmath101 satisfies @xmath102 the scattering length dependence of the bound state spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efimovplot ] .",
    "we plot the quantity @xmath103 against the inverse scattering length . for bound states",
    "@xmath104 corresponds to the binding momentum .",
    "the solid lines denote the efimov trimers while the scattering threshold is indicated by the hatched area .",
    "for @xmath105 the relevant threshold is the three - particle threshold .",
    "for @xmath106 , the atom - dimer threshold is lower in energy . only a few of the infinitely many efimov branches are shown .",
    "a given physical system has a fixed scattering length value and the corresponding states lie on a vertical line .",
    "changing the parameter @xmath79 by a factor @xmath28 corresponds to multiplying each branch of trimers with this factor without changing their shapes .",
    "one important result is that three - bound states exist for positive and negative scattering length .",
    "this is remarkable for the latter case since the two - body subsystem is unbound for @xmath105 . at a negative scattering length denoted by @xmath85 , a bound state with a given @xmath79",
    "has zero binding energy . as the inverse scattering length",
    "is increased , the trimer binding energy gets larger until it crosses the atom - dimer threshold at the positive scattering length @xmath84 .",
    "the quantities @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath79 are related to each other and can be used to quantify a branch of efimov states .",
    "the other branches then follow from the discrete scaling symmetry .",
    "we discussed in the previous section that one three - body parameter is required for a consistent description of the three - body system with zero - range interactions .",

    "a first step towards answering this question was performed in the work by platter _",

    "results of a more detailed analysis ( hammer & platter 2006 ) also lead to the conclusion that every trimer state is tied to two universal tetramer states with binding energies related to the binding energy of the next shallower trimer . in the unitary limit @xmath108",

    "it turns out that chiral effective field theory indicates the possibility that the @xmath148 scattering lengths diverge simultaneously at a quark mass values slightly larger than the physical ones .",
    "braaten and hammer conjectured therefore that a lattice qcd simulation of the three - nucleon system with quark masses close to this _ critical _ value would therefore lead to several bound states related to each other by efimov s scaling factor of 515 ( braaten & hammer 2003 ) .",

    "an equivalent effective quantum mechanics formulation was used .",
    "the study of the cutoff dependence of the four - body binding energies revealed that no four - body parameter is required for renormalization at leading order .",

    "_ 2004 ) . halo nuclei consist of a tightly bound core surrounded by one or more loosely bound valence nucleons .",
    "the valence nucleons are characterized by a very low separation energy compared to those in the core . as a consequence ,",
    "the radius of the halo nucleus is large compared to the radius of the core .",
    "a trivial example is the deuteron , which can be considered a two - body halo nucleus .",

    "because of the separation of scales in halo nuclei , they can be described by extensions of the pionless eft .",
    "one can assume the core to be structureless and treat the nucleus as a few - body system of the core and the valence nucleons .",
    "corrections from the structure of the core appear in higher orders and can be included in perturbation theory .",
    "cluster models of halo nuclei then appear as leading order approximations in this halo eft  .",
    "a new facet is the appearance of resonances as in the neutron - alpha system which leads to a more complicated singularity structure and renormalization compared to the few - nucleon system discussed above ( bertulani 2002 ) .",

    "two coupling constants in the effective lagrangian are fine tuned to unnatural values . at threshold , however , only one fine tuning is required and the eft becomes perturbative . because the @xmath155 interaction is resonant in the p - wave and not in the s - wave , the binding mechanism of @xmath125he is not the efimov effect . however , this nucleus can serve as a laboratory for studying the interplay of resonance structures in higher partial waves .",
    "three - body halo nuclei composed of a core and two valence neutrons are of particular interest due to the possibility of these systems to display the efimov effect ( efimov 1970 ) . since the scattering length can not be varied in halo nuclei , one looks for efimov scaling between different states of the same nucleus .",
