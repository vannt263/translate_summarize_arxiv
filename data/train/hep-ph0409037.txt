    "the experimental study of the central exclusive double - diffractive production processes at the tevatron is interesting in its own right , since it is an ideal way to improve our understanding of diffractive processes and the dynamics of the pomeron exchange .",

    "the + signs are used to denote the presence of large rapidity gaps ; here we will simply describe such processes as ` exclusive ' , with ` double - diffractive ' production being implied .",
    "the predictions for exclusive production are obtained by calculating the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : h ] using perturbative qcd .",
    "in addition we have to calculate the probability that the rapidity gaps are not populated by secondaries from the underlying event .",
    "however it is not easy to find an exclusive process which may be observed at the tevatron and so act as a ` standard candle ' for the theoretical predictions for exclusive higgs production .",
    "let us consider the possibilities .",
    "these are shown in brackets in fig .",

    "= 0.5    recently the first ` preliminary ' result on exclusive @xmath11 production has been reported @xcite .",
    "although it is consistent with perturbative qcd expectations @xcite , the mass of @xmath11-boson , which drives the scale of the process , is too low to justify just the use of perturbative qcd and azimuthal angular distributions appear to be in good agreement with the perturbatively based expectations @xcite . ] .",
    "one possible process with a larger scale is the exclusive production of a pair of high @xmath12 jets , @xmath13 @xcite . in principle",
    ", this process appears to be an ideal ` standard candle ' .",
    "the expected cross section is rather large , and we can study its behaviour as a function of the mass of the dijet system . unfortunately in the present cdf environment ,",
    "the background from the ` inelastic pomeron - pomeron collisions ' contribution is large as well .",
    "theoretically the exclusive dijets should be observed as a narrow peak , sitting well above the background , in the distribution of the ratio r_jj = e_dijet / e_pp at @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the energy of the incoming pomeron - pomeron system . in practice",
    "the peak is smeared out due to hadronization and the jet - searching algorithm . for jets with @xmath16 gev and a jet cone @xmath17",

    "bearing in mind the large uncertainties ( in both the theoretical calculations and in experimental identification of low @xmath12 jets ) at low scales , the predictions @xcite for @xmath21 gev are also in agreement with the corresponding cdf measurements @xcite .",
    "however there is no ` visible ' peak in the cdf data for @xmath19 close to 1 .",
    "the contribution from other channels ( called ` central inelastic ' in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is too large , and matches with the expected peak smoothly jet searching algorithm , rather than the jet cone algorithm , would improve the selection of the exclusive events .",
    "this is in accord with the studies in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "an alternative possibility is to measure exclusive @xmath22 production with high @xmath12 photons , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "here there are no problems with hadronization or with the identification of the jets .",
    "moreover , we can access much higher masses of the centrally produced system than in the @xmath11 case .",
    "on the other hand the exclusive cross section is rather small . as usual ,",
    "the perturbative qcd pomeron is described by two ( reggeized ) gluon exchange .",
    "however the photons can not be emitted from the gluon lines directly .",
    "we need first to create quarks .",
    "thus a quark loop is required ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gg]a ) , which causes an extra coupling @xmath24 in the amplitude .",
    "the prediction of the cross section for exclusive @xmath0 production , and the possible background contributions , are the subject of this paper .    in order to isolate the component of exclusive @xmath0 production which is driven by two - gluon @xmath25-channel exchange , we need to consider other possible sources of these events .",
    "possibilities are : + ( i ) inclusive reactions in which the production of a @xmath26 pair is such that the quarks transfer almost the whole of their energy to the emitted photons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gg]b ) , so that any additional hadrons ( coming from the hadronization of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) are soft , and so may be missed by the central detector ; + ( ii ) diagrams with the @xmath25-channel quark exchange ( fig .  [",

    "[ fig : gg]a have distributions that behave as @xmath30 constant , modulo log@xmath31 factors .",
    "however the parton distributions at low @xmath32 and moderate scales indicate that the quark densities are comparable to that of the gluon . on the other hand ,",
    "the photons can be emitted directly from a quark line ( without an extra loop and its accompanying small @xmath33 factor ) .",
    "moreover the ` skewed ' factor , @xmath34 , due to the asymmetric @xmath26 @xmath25-channel configurations is much larger for quarks , @xmath35 , than the corresponding factor for skewed @xmath25-channel gluons @xcite .",
    "since the exclusive cross section is proportional to @xmath36 @xcite , this is clearly important .",
    "first , we calculate exclusive @xmath0 production arising from gluon - exchange , as shown in fig .  [ fig : gg]a .",
    "we write the cross section in the factorized form @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the cross section for the hard @xmath39 subprocess which produces a @xmath0 system of mass @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the effective @xmath2 luminosity for production of a central system ( @xmath0 in our case ) with rapidity @xmath42 . for the exclusive @xmath0 production shown in fig .",

    "the skewed unintegrated density can be calculated from the conventional integrated gluon @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "the square root arises in ( [ eq : a6 ] ) because the survival probability is only relevant to the hard gluon .",
    "it is the presence of this sudakov factor which makes the integration in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) infrared stable , and perturbative qcd applicable .",
    "we use the mrst99 partons @xcite , and cut the loop integral at @xmath60 gev , as in @xcite .",
    "we also have to compute the probability , @xmath61 , that the rapidity gaps are not populated by secondaries from soft rescattering from the colliding proton and antiproton .",
    "we calculate @xmath61 using a two - channel eikonal model @xcite .    to compute the subprocess cross section , @xmath62,we use the known qed results for the @xmath63 helicity amplitudes from refs .",
    "note that the incoming active gluons are in a @xmath64-even , @xmath65 state @xcite , where @xmath66 is the proton beam direction .",

    "the vertical dotted lines indicate the angles corresponding to a rapidity difference between the two photons @xmath71 or 3 .",
    "we see that the logarithmic enhancement of the differential cross section at @xmath72 for fixed @xmath40 is strongly suppressed , by the jacobian , when we select events with fixed @xmath73 .",
    "the cross section decreases , since the fixed value of @xmath73 can only be achieved at small angles by increasing the value of @xmath40 , while the cross section behaves as @xmath74 .",

    "it is not anticipated to be large . for @xmath78 gev photons , the whole cross section in the rapidity interval @xmath79 ( @xmath80 100 fb ) exceeds the exclusive cross section ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gg]a ) by a factor of about 50",
    ". however the probability not to observe any hadrons produced via @xmath26 hadronization is very small , so we hope that this background can be suppressed sufficiently to see the exclusive signal .",
    "here we discuss the @xmath3 @xmath25-channel exchange contribution to exclusive @xmath0 production , as shown in fig .",

    "the momentum fractions carried by the incoming photons are x_1,2  =  ( m_/s ) e^y , the @xmath207 are the usual dipole form factors of the proton .",
    "they provide the upper cut - off on the integrals . to calculate the @xmath208 amplitudes we use ref .",
    "we include fermion loops for the quarks , electron , muon and tau .",

    "we use this diagram to compute the low @xmath213 gev ) contribution to the luminosity in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) , which was excluded from the perturbative calculation .",
    "we put the same limit on the virtuality of the @xmath25-channel left quark line in fig .",
    "this cut - off strongly reduces the size of the pomeron - pomeron@xmath214 amplitude . unlike exclusive @xmath11 production , where the perturbative and non - perturbative contributions are comparable @xcite , here the @xmath0 yield from fig .",
    "@xmath204b is less than a few percent of the perturbative @xmath39 cross section . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is no interference between the real amplitudes of the diagrams in fig .",
    "@xmath204 and the imaginary amplitude corresponding to fig .  [ fig : gg]a ; here we refer to the luminosity amplitudes , since for the @xmath65 case the fermion loop contribution is real . strictly speaking this is only true for the process fig .",
    "@xmath204b if we assume that the non - perturbative pomeron interacts with the quark via a photon- like vertex @xmath215 , which provides @xmath96-channel quark helicity conservation . for the case of @xmath216-exchange ,",
    "@xmath204a , there may be some @xmath217 contribution where the @xmath218 amplitude has its own imaginary part .",

    "the double diffractive exclusive production of a massive system ( such as a higgs boson ) is a good way to search , and to study , new physics at the lhc .",
    "the existence of rapidity gaps on either side of the system means that the event rate will be suppressed .",
    "the observation of the exclusive production of a pair of high @xmath12 photons at the tevatron offers the possibility to check the exclusive prediction of these types of process . as can be seen from fig .  6 ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the exclusive diffractive production of such a pair of photons is driven by the same two - gluon exchange mechanism , that is by the same effective @xmath221 luminosity , as is exclusive diffractive higgs boson production .",
    "therefore , indeed , this process can be used as a ` standard candle ' to check and to monitor the exclusive @xmath221 luminosity that has been used for the prediction of the higgs cross section .",
    "the uncertainty of the predictions comes from the parton distributions used to calculate the luminosities , the model dependent calculation of the survival factors @xmath222 and the lack of knowledge of the nlo corrections to the hard subprocess . the first two",
    "have been discussed above and in ref .",
    "@xcite . since we would like to use exclusive @xmath0 as a ` standard candle ' to monitor the exclusive @xmath221 luminosity , it is important to calculate the nlo correction to @xmath39 amplitudes accounting for the presence of the additional @xmath25-channel gluon ( shown on the left in fig .",
