    "accreting neutron stars ( nss ) in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) exhibit rapid , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in their x - ray fluxes .",
    "the so - called horizontal - branch oscillations ( hbos ) , discovered in a subclass of lmxbs called z sources , are low - frequency qpos ( lfqpos ) with centroid frequencies in the range of 15 - 60  hz , @xmath6-values of order a few , and rms amplitudes @xmath7 10  % ( see van der klis 1995 for a review ) .",
    "one interpretation of the hbos is the magnetospheric beat - frequency model ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ) in which the hbo frequency is identified with the difference frequency between the keplerian frequency at the magnetospheric boundary and the spin frequency of the ns .",
    "however , over the last few years , the discovery of kilohertz ( 3001300  hz ) qpos in @xmath8 lmxbs by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) has called into question this interpretation of the hbos ( see van der klis 2000 for a review ) .",
    "in particular , observations indicate that in most z sources , khz qpos ( which often come in pairs ) occur simultaneously with the hbos . in several atoll sources ( which are thought to have weaker magnetic fields and smaller accretion rates than the z sources ) ,",
    "similar lfqpos have also been found at the same time when khz qpos occur .",
    "while the origin of the khz qpos is still being debated , it is convenient ( as in all current theoretical models ; see van der klis 2000 and references therein ) to associate one of the khz peaks with the orbital motion in the inner edge of the accretion disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the discovery of nearly coherent oscillations during x - ray bursts in several lmxbs establishes the spin frequency of the ns to be @xmath9 300600  hz ( see strohmayer 2000 ) .",
    "obviously , the beating between the khz orbital frequency and the spin frequency can not produce the 1060  hz lfqpos .",
    "stella & vietri ( 1998 ) suggested that the lfqpos are associated with the lense - thirring precession of the inner accretion disk around the rotating ns .",
    "if the lfqpo and the khz qpos are generated at the same special radius in the disk , this implies a quadratic relation between the lfqpo frequency and the khz qpo frequency , in rough agreement with observations ( usually for certain range of x - ray fluxes ; but see  4.4 ) . for reasonable values of ns moment of inertia",
    ", the data require that the observed lfqpo peaks correspond to 2 or 4 times the lense - thirring frequency ( stella & vietri 1998 ; ford & van der klis 1998 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1999 ) ; this may be possible since a precessing disk may induce x - ray flux variation mainly at the harmonics of its fundamental precession frequency and there may be `` sub - harmonic '' feature buried in the x - ray power spectra ( see jonker et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "there are several theoretical and observational puzzles associated with the lense - thirring interpretation of lfqpos .",
    "first , it is well - known that the combined effects of differential precession and viscosity tend to keep the inner region of the disk [ within @xmath10 perpendicular to the ns spin axis ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ) . a mechanism to drive the disk tilt",
    "is then needed for the precession to make sense .",
    "second , because different `` rings '' in the disk have different precession rates and are strongly coupled to each other , a global mode analysis is needed to determine the true precession rate of the inner disk .",
    "markovi & lamb ( 1998 ) carried out such an analysis but found that all the modes are damped even when the radiation driven warping torque ( pringle 1996 ) is included .",
    "third , pure lense - thirring precession has difficulty in explaining the observed behavior of the lfqpo frequency as a function of the accretion rate of the system ( wijnands et al .",
    "1996 ; psaltis et al .  1999 ; see  4.4 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the magnetically driven warping instability ( lai 1999 ) , resulting from interactions between the weakly magnetized ( @xmath11  g ) ns and the inner accretion disk ( see  2 ) , can naturally overcome the bardeen - petterson viscous damping and therefore induces a tilt in the inner disk . by carrying out a global analysis of disk precession / warping modes , including magnetic torques in addition to the lense - thirring and classical precession torques , we obtain , for the first time , growing warping / precession modes of the disk ( see  3 and  4 ) .",
    "moreover , we show that the magnetically driven precession torque ( lai 1999 ; see  2 ) significantly affects the actual disk precession frequency as the accretion rate increases ; this can potentially explain the observed @xmath4-dependent behaviors of the lfqpos (  4 ) .",
    "it is known that if the accretion disk is slightly tilted from the equatorial plane of a rotating neutron star , it precesses due to general relativistic frame - dragging effect ( lense - thirring precession ) and also due to oblateness of the rotating star ( classical precession ) . for a magnetized neutron star , there is an additional magnetically driven precession and warping of the disk ; these arise from interactions between the stellar magnetic field and the disk before the latter is truncated at the magnetospheric boundary ( lai 1999 ) .",
    "the magnetic torques appear under the generic condition that the stellar magnetic field ( treated as a dipole in this paper ) is not aligned with the stellar spin axis .",
    "depending on how the disk responds to the stellar field , two different kinds of torque arise : ( i ) if the vertical stellar magnetic field @xmath12 penetrates the disk , it gets twisted by the disk rotation to produce an azimuthal field @xmath13 that has different signs above and below the disk ( @xmath14 is the azimuthal pitch of the field line and depends on the dissipation in the disk ) , and a radial surface current @xmath15 results . the interaction between @xmath15 and the stellar @xmath16 gives rise to a vertical force . while the mean force ( averaging over the azimuthal direction ) is zero , the uneven distribution of the force induces a net _ warping torque _ which tends to misalign the angular momentum of the disk with the stellar spin axis .",
    "( ii ) if the disk does not allow the vertical stellar field ( e.g. , the rapidly varying component of @xmath12 due to stellar rotation ) to penetrate , an azimuthal screening current @xmath17 will be induced on the disk .",
    "this @xmath17 interacts with the radial magnetic field @xmath18 and produces a vertical force .",
    "the resulting _ precessional torque _ tends to drive the disk into retrograde precession around the stellar spin axis .    in general , both the magnetic warping torque and the precessional torque are present . for small disk tilt angle @xmath19 ( the angle between the disk normal and the spin axis ) , the warping rate and precession angular frequency at radius @xmath20 are given by ( see lai 1999 ) _ m ( r)=^2 , [ eqn : gamma_m ] and _ m ( r)=-^2 , [ eqn : omega_m ] where @xmath21 is the stellar magnetic dipole moment , @xmath22 is the angle between the magnetic dipole axis and the spin axis , @xmath23 is the orbital angular frequency , and @xmath24 is the surface density of the disk .",
    "the dimensionless function @xmath25 is given by d(r)=max  ( , ) , [ eqn : d ] where @xmath26 is the half - thickness and @xmath5 is the inner radius of the disk .",
    "here we apply these magnetic torques to lmxbs containing weakly magnetized ( @xmath27  g ) nss .",
    "we parametrize the properties of the inner disk using the `` inner region '' ( radiation- and - scattering dominated ) solution of @xmath28-disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , with ( r)&=&(1050  g  cm^-2)_-1 ^ -1m_1.4 ^ -1/2 m_17 ^ -1r_6 ^ 3/2(r)^-1 , [ eqn : surface density ] + h(r)&=&(1.1  km)m_17(r ) , [ eqn : half - thickness ] where @xmath29 is the @xmath28-viscosity , @xmath30 is neutron star s mass , @xmath31 is the mass accretion rate and @xmath32 . the dimensionless function @xmath33 is given by in a model - dependent way ( see lai 1999 for an example ) .",

    "4 ) .      the behavior of @xmath178 as a function of @xmath4 ( see figs .",
    "35 ) is similar to the features observed for the lfqpos in lmxbs ( see van der klis 1995 , 2000 ) .",
    "while for some systems , the lfqpo frequencies increase as the x - ray flux increases , for other systems , a non - monotonic ( even opposite ) correlation between the qpo frequency and @xmath4 has been observed . as an example , for the z source gx 17 + 2 , using the position of the source on the x - ray color - color diagram as an indicator of @xmath4 , wijnands et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that the hbo frequency increases with @xmath4 for small @xmath4 but decreases with further increase of @xmath4 . in the simple model where the lfqpo is identified with the precession frequency at the disk inner radius @xmath5 ( stella & vietri 1998 ;",
    "see  1 ) , the non - monotonic behavior is difficult to explain , even when the classical ( retrograde ) precession is included and @xmath179 have a similar @xmath20-dependence ; see eqs .",

    "however , we see from fig .",
    "4 that when we consider global disk modes and include the magnetic effects , a variety of @xmath180 behaviors are possible . in our model",
    "the turnover of the @xmath180 correlation occurs for two reasons : ( 1 ) the magnetically driven retrograde precession @xmath181 becomes more important with increasing @xmath4 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : fid3a ] ) & ( [ eqn : fid3b ] ) ] ; ( 2 ) the viscous stress becomes more important as @xmath4 increases , and makes the mode less concentrated around @xmath5 ; thus @xmath178 is more reduced from @xmath156 with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "we note that even when magnetic effects are not included [ case ( i ) & ( ii ) ] , the `` turnover '' feature is obtained due to mechanism ( 2 ) as explained above ( see fig .",
    "however , these modes are highly damped by viscosity .",
    "only the magnetic warping torque can make the mode grow ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    a related puzzle concerns",
    "the correlation between the lfqpo frequency and the higher kilohertz qpo frequency ( e.g. , stella & vietri 1998 ; ford & van der klis 1998 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1999 ; see  1 ) . it was found that for several sources the positive correlation flattens ( and even turns over ) for large khz qpo frequencies ( and large @xmath4 ) ( see homan et al .",
    "2001 for a clear case of such turnover in gx 17 + 2 ) . again",
    ", this feature is difficult to explain with the simple picture of lense - thirring and classical precessions at @xmath5 , but can be accounted for qualitatively by our global disk oscillation model with magnetic effects ( see fig .  6 ; note that we have not tried to vary the model parameters to `` fit '' the observations ) .",
    "more quantitative comparison between our models and the data require a better understanding of the origin of khz qpos ( e.g. , it is not certain whether the khz qpo frequency is the keplerian frequency at @xmath5 ; see  5 for other uncertainties expected in real systems ) .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the inner region of the disk around a weakly magnetized ( @xmath11  g ) ns is warped due to magnetic field ",
    "disk interactions ( see lai 1999 ) and therefore must precess under the combined effects of relativistic frame dragging , classical precession ( due to the oblateness of the ns ) and magnetic torques .",
    "we have found growing warping / precession modes of the inner disk and shown that these modes have properties that resemble the 1060  hz low - frequency qpos observed in lmxbs ( see  4 ) .",
    "although our treatments of disk warping / precession go beyond many previous models of qpos ( these models typically identify a qpo frequency as the characteristic frequency of a test mass at certain special radius in the disk ; see van der klis 2000 for a review ) , they still contain important idealizations .",
    "for example , we have assumed the stellar field to be dipolar when considering the magnetic field  disk interactions .",
    "this is unlikely to be correct for lmxbs since the disk ( with @xmath5 only a few stellar radii ) can produce significant change in the global field topology even when the intrinsic stellar field is dipolar ( see lai , lovelace & wasserman 1999 ) .",
    "observationally , the absence of persistent millisecond pulsation in all known lmxbs but sax j1808.43658 ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) and the frequency drift of burst oscillations ( e.g. , strohmayer 2000 ; see also cumming et al .",
    "2001 ) may imply that the ns does not possess a well - defined dipole field , although a more complex field is possible .",
    "also , we have only studied the linear behavior of the warping / precession modes in this paper .",
    "because of these idealizations and the uncertainties in observations ( e.g. , it is difficult to determine @xmath4 precisely from observations ) , more quantitative comparison between the observational data and our theory is premature at present .",
    "nevertheless , the results presented in this paper demonstrate that magnetically driven warping and precession can give rise to a variety of new possibilities for the dynamical behaviors of inner accretion disks around magnetic nss .    concerning the observed properties of qpos , many issues remain unanswered in our paper ( and in other related qpo studies ) : e.g , how does the mode manifest itself as a variation in the x - ray flux ?",
    "how is the observed qpo amplitude ( as large as @xmath182 ) produced ?",
    "one possibility is that the lfqpo is caused by occultation of the central ns by the warped , precessing inner disk .",
    "another issue is that for the observed ns spin rates ( based on observations of burst oscillations ) and reasonable moment of inertia of the neutron star , the data require that the observed lfqpo corresponds to 2 or 4 times the precession mode frequency ( see  1 ; the fact that the global mode frequency is smaller than the precession frequency at @xmath5 exacerbates the problem ) ; while this may be possible , more theoretical study on this issue is needed .",
    "finally , there is an indication ( but by no means proven ) that some black hole systems display low - frequency qpos which resemble their counterparts in ns systems ( psaltis , belloni & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "clearly , the magnetic warping and precession torques discussed in this paper are irrelevant to black hole systems as @xmath4 increases ( see fig .  3 ) ; this result applies equally to the black hole systems except that the mode is damped in the absence of other excitation mechanisms . ] .",
    "we note that the phenomenology of black hole qpos is much less developed , and that many of the @xmath4-dependent behaviors of lfqpos observed in ns systems are absent in the black hole systems ( see remillard 2001 ) ."
