    "understanding the non - perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the important subjects in elementary particle physics .",
    "the phase diagram of qcd at finite temperature and finite density has been studied intensively .",
    "there are various non - perturbative approaches to qcd , such as the lattice qcd , the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) and the schwinger - dyson equations ( sdes ) . however , these mothods have serious problems respectively .",
    "the lattice qcd is a powerful method because of the first - principle caluclation .",
    "however , it is difficult to maintain the chiral symmetry on the lattice field . at finite density",
    ", the qcd action has a complex phase due to the quark chemical potential . owing to this problem ,",
    "called the sign problem , the statistical errors of simulation can not be controlled easily . the mfa or the sdes with the ladder approximation",
    "have been used in various types of models .",
    "however , these methods have difficulties in the further improvement of the approximation without which the strong gauge dependences can not be cured .",
    "+ we study the non - perturbative properties using the non - perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) .",
    "the nprg method gives us not only the equivalent results to mfa and sdes in the lowest order approximation @xcite , but also the systematic method for improving approximation .",
    "we do nt confront the sign problem at finite density .",
    "however , the nprg breaks gauge symmetry due to inclusion of the momentum cutoff and also it has the gauge dependences as mfa and sdes .",
    "these problems can be treated by systematic improvement of approximation .",
    "it reported that the gauge dependence has almost been wiped away by including the non - ladder diagrams to the beta functions @xcite .",
    "+ we appliy the nprg to the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite at finite temperature and finite density . the njl model is the effective theory with four - fermi interactions and describes the s@xmath1sb of qcd .",
    "we compare the results improved by the nprg method with the mean field approximation .",
    "we briefly explain the basic idea of nprg @xcite in quantum field theory . we divide the degrees of freedom of quantum field @xmath2 into the higher modes with @xmath3 and the lower modes with @xmath4 in the euclidean space .",
    "then we define the effective action @xmath5 $ ] , called the wilsonian effective action , by integrating out only the higher modes in the path integral @xmath6 } = \\int ^{\\lambda}{\\mathcal d}\\phi_<~e^{-s_{\\rm eff}[\\phi _ < ; \\lambda]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the initial ( bare ) action at the initial cutoff @xmath8 .",
    "the nprg equation describes the dependence of the wilsonian effective action on the cutoff @xmath9 , @xmath10=\\beta[s_{\\rm eff};\\lambda].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right hand side of this equation is called the beta function .",
    "it is evaluated as the infinitesimal change of the wilsonian effective action by infinitesimally lowering the cutoff @xmath9 .",
    "+ there are various formulations of nprg equation @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the wetterich flow equation @xcite which is a differential equation for the legendre effective action with ir cutoff , @xmath11=\\frac{1}{2}{\\rm str}\\left\\ { \\left [ \\frac{\\overrightarrow \\delta } { \\delta \\phi}\\gamma _ { \\lambda}[\\phi]\\frac{\\overleftarrow \\delta } { \\delta \\phi}+r_{\\lambda}\\right]^{-1}\\cdot   ( \\partial _ { \\lambda}r_{\\lambda } ) \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the cutoff profile function which divides the higher and the lower modes of quantum field .",
    "this equation is exact .",
    "it describes the development of the effective action starting from the bare action @xmath7 to the legendre effective action @xmath13 .",
    "+ the equation ( [ wetterich ] ) is a functional differential equation and we can not solve it exactly .",
    "we have to make some approximation .",
    "first , the effective action is expanded into power series of derivative of fields , @xmath14=\\int d^4x\\left [ v_{\\lambda}(\\phi)+\\frac{1}{2}z_{\\lambda}(\\phi)(\\partial _ { \\mu}\\phi)^2+\\frac{1}{2}y_{\\lambda}(\\phi)(\\partial ^2 \\phi)^2+\\cdots   \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the effective potential generated and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the field renormalization factors .",
    "this method is called the derivative expantion .",
    "next , we ignore all the conections to terms with derivatives",
    ". then the effective action is represented by the effective potential @xmath15 .",
    "this approximation , called the local potential approximation ( lpa ) @xcite , allows us to evaluated the effective action only with the zero momentum mode of fields .",
    "we reduce eq .",
    "( [ wetterich ] ) to be a partial differential equation for the effective potential @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore if the effective potential is spanned by the polynomials of fields , we get infinitely coupled ordinary differential equations for the expansion coefficients ( the coupling constants ) .",
    "the lagrangian of the njl model @xcite with one flavor and one color is given by @xmath18 this lagrangian is invariant under the chiral u(1 ) transformation : @xmath19 .",
    "the four - fermi coupling constant @xmath20 corresponds to the fluctuation of the chiral order parameter : @xmath21 , therefore , we may conclude the s@xmath1sb by divergence of the four - fermi coupling constant at a finite energy scale .",
    "+ the njl model at finite temperature and finite density is defined by the following euclidean bare action , @xmath22.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the four - fermi interaction @xmath23 generates the effective four - fermi coupling constant @xmath24 by quantum corrections , that is , by driving the infrared cutoff scale to the low energy . the effective action in lpa is denoted by @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we calculate the generated four - fermi interactions through the diagrams in fig .  [ 4fermi ] .",
    "the first diagram in the dashed box in fig .",
    "[ 4fermi ] is the so - colled large-@xmath0 leading term .",
    "if we adopt only this term in the beta function of the four - fermi coupling constant , we get the equivarent results to the mfa or the ladder sdes .",
    "note that we can add the large-@xmath0 non - leading terms without any difficulty .",
    "+        in this study , we use the 3-@xmath26 optimized cutoff function @xcite in eq .",
    "( [ wetterich ] ) , @xmath27 at finite temperaure , the time direction momentum is discretized and the integration of it changes to the matsubara summation , therefore , the 3-@xmath26 cutoff function is appropriate to write down the renormalization group equations in a simple form .",
    "the rges we solve are the following three simultaneous differential equations , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the threshold functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by the large-@xmath0 leading diagram and the non - leading diagrams respectively in fig .",
    "[ 4fermi ] , and are expressed as @xmath35 \\right|_{\\omega \\to 1},\\\\ i_1&=\\left . \\left",
    "[ \\frac{1}{(1+{\\tilde \\mu})^2}\\left ( \\frac{1}{2}-n_+ \\right ) + \\frac{1}{(1-{\\tilde \\mu})^2}\\left ( \\frac{1}{2}-n_-\\right)+\\frac{1}{1+{\\tilde \\mu}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\omega}n_+ + \\frac{1}{1-{\\tilde \\mu}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\omega}n_-\\right ] \\right|_{\\omega \\to 1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are the fermi - dirac distribution functions , @xmath37 . the large-@xmath0 non - leading effect @xmath38 contributes towards the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "especially , this effect is large at low temperature and high density .",
    "if temperature vanishes , the threshold function @xmath38 diverges at @xmath39 when the cutoff reaches the fermi surface .",
    "+ we numerically solve the rges ( [ rge ] ) .",
    "we may conclude the s@xmath1sb when @xmath40 passes the origin .",
    "we show the rg flows of @xmath40 of the large-@xmath0 leading and the non - leaing in fig .  [ leading ] and [ non - leading ] respectively .",
    "we draw rg flows after @xmath40 passes the origin .",
    "this is justified by the `` weak solution '' method @xcite in case of the large-@xmath0 leading .",
    "infact , the inverse four - fermi coupling constant @xmath40 corresponds to the mass squared of meson fields introduced as the auxiliary fields . in other words , @xmath40 corresponds to the curvature of the effective potential of meson field at the origin , and thus , the negative of @xmath40 means that the curvature of the effective potential at the origin becomes negative . in this case , the effective potential has a global minimum at non - zero expectation value of meson field , then the s@xmath1sb occurrs . if we directly solve the rge for the four - fermi coupling constant , the rg flows stop on the way because the four - fermi coupling constant diverges at finite @xmath41 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ leading ] , some flows go to the negative region , and then comes back to the positive region afterwards .",
    "we may regard such turn - over flows as symmetric phase in case of the large-@xmath0 leading . in case of the large-@xmath0 non - leading , it is difficult to justify of this interpretation .",
    "however , we adopt the some criterion here . +     of the large-@xmath0 non - leading on the @xmath42 plane at @xmath43 and various temperatures .",
    "we set the initial inverse four - fermi coupling to 0.3.,width=207 ]     of the large-@xmath0 non - leading on the @xmath42 plane at @xmath43 and various temperatures .",
    "we set the initial inverse four - fermi coupling to 0.3.,width=207 ]    the phase diagrams of the large-@xmath0 leading and the non - leading calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "we can see the drastic difference of behavior of phase boundaries due to the large-@xmath0 non - leading effects at low temperature and high density .     leading and non - leading calculation , width=453 ]",
    "we study the nambu  jona - lasinio model by using the non - perturbative renormalization group at finite temperature and finite density .",
    "we discuss the difference of the rg flows and phase boundaries between the mean field approximation results and those including the large-@xmath0 non - leading effects .",
    "we find that the large-@xmath0 non - leading effects become large and contribute to the restoration of chiral symmetry at low temperture and high density .",
    "+ however , this analysis tells us only second - order phase transition because we evaluate only the rg flow of the four - fermi coupling constant . in other words , we see the behaivor of the curvature of the mesonic effective potential at the origin only , and therefore , we overlook the possibility of the first - order transitions .",
    "we should bosonize the four - fermi interactions  @xcite or treat total mass function  @xcite in order to evaluate the order of phase transition .",
