    "black hole thermodynamics@xcite , which relates the mass @xmath2 , surface gravity @xmath3 , and area @xmath4 of a black hole to the energy @xmath5 , temperature @xmath6 , and entropy @xmath7 , according to : @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is newton s constant ) has recently been extended to include black hole counterparts for the pressure @xmath10 and volume @xmath11 .",
    "the cosmological constant of the spacetime in question supplies the pressure through the relation @xmath12 , while the thermodynamic volume @xmath11 is a derived quantity that in static cases is associated with the volume occupied by the black hole itself .",
    "( we will use geometrical units where @xmath13 have been set to unity . ) the formalism works in multiple dimensions , and our remarks will apply to those situations too , although we will study four  dimensional examples in this paper .",
    "the black holes may have other parameters such as gauge charges @xmath14 and angular momenta @xmath15 , and these , with their conjugates the potentials @xmath16 and angular velocities @xmath17 , enter additively into the first law in the usual manner .    in the presence of a variable pressure @xmath10 , the extension shifts@xcite the identification of the mass @xmath2 from determining the internal energy @xmath5 to setting the _ enthalpy _ :",
    "so the first law now becomes : @xmath19 in four dimensions with an electric charge and rotation .",
    "when @xmath10 is removed from the list of variables , we return to the usual situation .    in the case of static black holes ,",
    "the thermodynamic volume @xmath11 is simply the `` geometric '' volume constructed by naive use of the radius of the black hole horizon .",
    "for example , in four dimensions , for a schwarzschild black hole with horizon radius @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 in general , the thermodynamic entropy is not equal to the naive geometric volume@xcite .",
    "enthalpy is very natural here@xcite : the cosmological constant is a spacetime energy density of @xmath22 per unit volume . forming a black hole of volume",
    "@xmath11 requires cutting out a region of spacetime of that volume , at cost @xmath23 , and this energy of formation is naturally captured by the enthalpy .",
    "it seems an important fact that once we have dynamical @xmath10 , and its conjugate @xmath11 , we ought to explore the full range of thermodynamic physics that having such variables available affords us .",
    "for example , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , it is natural to consider building heat engines in this gravity setting , where mechanical work _",
    "i.e. _ actual changing of thermodynamic volumes , can be performed . a key idea to take away here",
    "is that one should be able to consider a particular spacetime solution to be the result of a ( gravitational ) thermodynamic process , and since enthalpy seems to be a natural and central quantity , we should trace not just energy @xmath5 but pay attention to the processes that give rise to a particular energy of formation .",
    "we will take this idea seriously in this paper .",
    "one of the main points of this paper is to emphasise that if we are to take the extended thermodynamics seriously , it should apply not just to black hole spacetimes , but _ all _ spacetimes , and the consequences should be explored .",
    "indeed , for negative cosmological constant at least , holography@xcite would appear to demand this .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for a discussion of how this extended thermodynamics fits with holography . ) in particular , there are ways of assigning thermodynamic quantities such as temperature and entropy to spacetimes that do not have horizons  @xcite , using the same semi  classical quantum gravity calculus that endows black holes with their thermodynamic properties .",
    "it seems therefore neglectful ( at best ) to not consider what these spacetimes thermodynamic properties are in this extended scheme , being careful to interpret these properties in the light of volume being dynamical .",
    "two examples that spring to mind are the taub ",
    "nut @xcite and taub ",
    "bolt @xcite spacetimes , which have a metric of the following form for negative cosmological constant@xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 with the cosmological constant @xmath26 .",
    "time @xmath27 here is euclidean with period @xmath28 ( in order to ensure the invisibility of misner strings@xcite ) , and the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the range of @xmath31 will have certain restrictions ( depending upon whether we are taub  nut or taub  bolt ) that we will review below .",
    "the spaces are asymptotically ads@xmath0 , generically ; the topological @xmath1 formed by the @xmath27 circle fibred over the @xmath32 of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is squashed for general @xmath30 .",
    "we will study each case in the next sections , with interesting results for the extended thermodynamics .",
    "for the metric given in equations  ( [ eq : metric ] ) and  ( [ eq : metric - function ] ) the circle parameterized by @xmath27 is hopf fibred over the  @xmath32 with first chern class @xmath30 .",
    "the vector @xmath35 that generates the @xmath36 of translations along the circle will have fixed points ( where the fibre degenerates ) at some @xmath31 when @xmath37 vanishes .",
    "the difference between a nut and a bolt is whether the fixed point set is zero dimensional or two dimensional@xcite .",
    "the former case is the nut , and is at @xmath38 where the @xmath32 is of zero size .",
    "there , @xmath39 .",
    "there is an additional condition on @xmath37 at this point to ensure that there s no conical singularity : @xmath40 .",
    "these conditions on the parameters in the metric were made explicit in ref.@xcite , and for completeness we quote them here .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath29 becomes @xmath41 simplifying the metric function @xmath42 , and we have that @xmath43 .",
    "in fact the action of this spacetime was computed in refs.@xcite to be : @xmath44 from which the mass ( divided by @xmath9 ) given above emerges as @xmath45 , ( recall that @xmath28 ) and the entropy as @xmath46 consider the extended thermodynamics , where the cosmological constant defines a dynamical variable , the pressure @xmath47 . as recalled in the previous section , we should interpret @xmath48 not as the energy @xmath5 but the enthalpy @xmath49 of the gravitational thermodynamics , where @xmath50 has @xmath7 and @xmath10 as its natural variables , and the first law yields : @xmath51",
    "so we have : @xmath52 and the full @xmath53 dependence of @xmath54 is implied through the elimination of @xmath30 between this and equation  ( [ eq : taub - nut - entropy ] ) . as a check , we can recover the temperature through @xmath55 since , from  ( [ eq : taub - nut - entropy ] ) : @xmath56 now we are ready for something new .",
    "we define the thermodynamic volume through the relation @xmath57 , and get : @xmath58 since , from  ( [ eq : taub - nut - entropy ] ) : @xmath59 equation  ( [ eq : taub - nut - volume ] ) is our first new result , and we should pause to understand it .",
    "first , we note that it is negative , which is certainly puzzling for a volume ! we will interpret the sign shortly . sign aside , we should also note that this is a new and rather extreme example of a case where the thermodynamic volume and the naive geometric volume differ , joining the example of the rotating black hole@xcite . here , since the @xmath32 at the origin is of zero radius , the naive geometric volume entirely vanishes !    before proceeding , we should check that our result is consistent with scaling in four dimensions , by seeing if our thermodynamic quantities satisfy a smarr relation@xcite .",
    "recalling that the temperature is @xmath60 , the expressions  ( [ eq : taub - nut - enthalpy ] ) ,  ( [ eq : taub - nut - entropy ] ) and  ( [ eq : taub - nut - volume ] ) can be combined to show that : @xmath61 which is satisfying .",
    "in fact , it was the cosmological constant modification of the smarr relation that inspired the suggestion@xcite that the black hole mass should be treated as an enthalpy .",
    "note that we can also derive an expression for the internal energy of taub  nut in this picture by defining @xmath62 , giving : @xmath63\\ .\\ ] ]    to help interpret the negative sign of the volume  ( [ eq : taub - nut - volume ] ) , recall the case of schwarzschild that we reviewed in the previous section .",
    "there , the thermodynamic volume @xmath64 recovered was the flat space volume of a ball whose radius was that of the horizon .",
    "recall that the enthalpy is the energy of the system plus the energy needed to make the system , so one imagines starting with an empty spacetime with coordinate @xmath31 running from 0 to @xmath65 , and cosmological constant @xmath66 . making",
    "the black hole involves cutting out the volume @xmath64 . cutting out this chunk of spacetime to insert the black hole costs energy @xmath67 .",
    "this is a core idea that we want to refine and exploit in what is to follow , so let us state clearly what we have in mind . in that static black hole case , we should think of forming the whole black hole solution  our `` system ''  _ via _ a thermodynamic process . in this process",
    ", the system does work on the universe ( pushing against it and reducing its volume ) in the process of its creation , and this is what went into the enthalpy .",
    "we should make exactly the same interpretation here for taub  nut .",
    "we imagine starting with empty space again , with a coordinate @xmath31 running from 0 to @xmath65 as before .",
    "we must now adjust the volume in order to form our taub  nut geometry and then repair it again where the spacetime `` starts '' at @xmath68 .",
    "there is a subtle difference with the black hole case .",
    "there , the @xmath32 where the radial coordinate begins at @xmath69 is at finite size , which is consistent with having cut something out of the spacetime . here",
    ", @xmath31 begins away from zero again , at @xmath68 , but the @xmath32 is at zero size too .",
    "this , we propose , should be interpreted not as cutting out some volume , but instead _ adding some in_. in other words , in our dynamical language , the _ universe _ does work to create the system ( our taub  nut solution ) , not the other way around .",
    "so the contribution to the enthalpy is negative : @xmath70 .",
    "so there is not really a negative volume for our system if we interpret appropriately in this dynamical setting .",
    "notice that since there s no geometrical counterpart for this volume left anywhere in the spacetime the formalism neatly avoids any puzzling issues with sign interpretations . a special case of all this is the nut charge value @xmath71 .",
    "this is nothing more than ads@xmath0 in an unusual slicing , and gives us a familiar example to understand all this with .",
    "we study it in subsection  [ eq : ads4 ] .",
    "let us pause to study a possibly helpful way of visualising the claimed interpretation of the volume , through an embedding of the spatial metric into a space of one dimension higher .",
    "our focus is the behaviour of the @xmath32s near the origin of coordinates .",
    "let us compare three cases : ( a ) a factor @xmath72 , ( b ) an @xmath73 factor and also ( c ) a factor @xmath74 , the latter being analogous to the black hole case of finite area horizon at the origin of the radial spatial coordinate .",
    "a simple model metric is @xmath75 where @xmath76 simply gives @xmath77 .",
    "we can embed our model space into a higher dimensional `` cylindrical '' four dimensional metric @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the embedding implies the following relations for the coordinates : @xmath81 some algebra gives : @xmath82 solving for @xmath83 , in case ( c ) , we get @xmath84 and in case ( a ) we have @xmath85 .",
    "the latter is imaginary , telling us that instead we should embed this case into the space with lorentzian signature obtained by continuing @xmath86 . for the qualitative comparison we wish to make here , it is the overall dependence on @xmath87 that we are interested in comparing and contrasting , so we plot the magnitude of @xmath83 for the three cases together in figure  [ fig : embedding ] .    r0.5        the case  ( b ) , @xmath76 , is just the horizontal axis @xmath88 , the trivial embedding .",
    "the cases ( a ) and ( c ) asymptotically agree at large  @xmath87 , approaching the asymptote @xmath89 ( the dotted line ) .",
    "the solid curve approaching from below is case ( c ) where the @xmath32s have factor @xmath90 and the solid curve approaching from above is the imaginary part of case ( a ) where the @xmath32s have factor @xmath91 .    in the @xmath76 case",
    "the space can go all the way down to @xmath92 , where the @xmath32s shrink to zero size , which is natural for @xmath77 .",
    "for the lower curve , @xmath87 decreases to a minimum value ,  @xmath30 , and then increases positively again by going from one branch of the square root to the other go negative , and can be considered as constructing a wormhole solution , but here we will identify @xmath31 and @xmath93 . ] .",
    "the @xmath32s never shrink to zero size . by contrast , the top curve has @xmath87 decrease to zero again , allowing the @xmath32s to pinch down to zero size is shrinking and so the origin looks like that of @xmath94 .",
    "this also looks odd here because we are embedding into a cylindrical coordinate system which naturally focuses on @xmath32s . ] .",
    "we can see by comparing the three embeddings on the same plot that they fill the embedding space rather differently , the case with @xmath74 filling less than the @xmath73 case , and the @xmath72 case filling more than the other two cases .",
    "it is in this ( admittedly partly qualitative ) sense that the taub  nut example corresponds to an _ increase _ in volume of the environment ( the universe , played here by the @xmath73 case ) for its formation , giving a negative volume in the enthalpy , as we saw .",
    "we can change tactics here and try to derive our formula for the thermodynamic volume by doing a naive computation designed to mimic what was done for static black holes ( reviewed in the introduction ) . the volume in equation  ( [ eq : naive ] )",
    "can be obtained by computing the four  dimensional volume element from the ( ads ) schwarzschild metric , and simply taking only the spatial part @xmath95 .",
    "the volume is then obtained by integrating from @xmath96 to @xmath69 . in a sense",
    ", @xmath97 is the `` effective '' spatial metric yielding that volume .",
    "turning to our case , the same procedure on equations  ( [ eq : metric ] ) and  ( [ eq : metric - function ] ) gives spatial volume element @xmath98 .",
    "so the effective spatial metric in our case is now : @xmath99 , the case @xmath100 of the model metric of the previous subsection . now",
    "although the spacetime really begins at @xmath68 , by analogy with the previous paragraph we should integrate from @xmath96 to @xmath68 , giving : @xmath101 this is the @xmath102 we obtained earlier , in equation  ( [ eq : taub - nut - volume ] ) !",
    "this lends support to our idea expressed above that the  added \" volume for taub ",
    "nut is negative .",
    "this is not a proof , since this procedure for deriving the thermodynamic volume is heuristic at best .",
    "while the method works for both cases , it is worth noting that a key difference between ( euclidean ) schwarzschild and taub  nut is that there is no distinguished geometrical surface in taub  nut to which we can associate a finite volume .",
    "its origin at @xmath68 is topologically  @xmath103 instead of @xmath104 .",
    "the thermodynamic volume @xmath102 is highly non  geometric in this sense , since the naive geometric volume is zero , the volume of the  @xmath32 of vanishing size at the origin .",
    "as we shall see , this naive procedure will reproduce the result for the thermodynamic volume  @xmath105 that we will get for the taub  bolt case studied in section  [ sec : taub - bolt ] . in that case , as we will review , the spacetime begins at some `` bolt radius '' @xmath106 .",
    "so our naive procedure here suggests that to work out the volume we should do the integral in equation  ( [ eq : naive - integral ] ) again , but now integrate  @xmath31 from zero to @xmath107 .",
    "the resulting expression is exactly what we will get by using the more careful enthalpy procedure .      for the case @xmath71 , the ads ",
    "taub  nut solution of the previous section is in fact ads@xmath0 with a non ",
    "trivial slicing .",
    "( the trivial case of ads@xmath0 here , having @xmath108 slices , arises from setting @xmath76 . )",
    "writing ( as in ref.@xcite ) @xmath109 , the radial slicing is such that the angle @xmath110 ( period @xmath111 ) and the @xmath32 angles @xmath112 form a round @xmath1 , and the metric becomes : @xmath113\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath114 which gives , once we put the boundary at finite distance ( @xmath115 ) using the transformation @xmath116 , the standard @xmath1 radial slicing of ads@xmath0 known as the poincar ball .    for this case , @xmath117 , and",
    "therefore the enthalpy @xmath118 vanishes too .",
    "from the perspective of the extended thermodynamics we have a new understanding of this .",
    "the enthalpy vanishes because there is a cancellation between the energy of the spacetime , @xmath119 , and the energy of formation , @xmath120 , where : @xmath121 according to our dynamical interpretation of the previous section , @xmath122 is the amount by which the volume of the universe increased in order to form the spacetime .",
    "it has already been noticed@xcite that the non  vanishing entropy of ads@xmath0 for this time slicing is negative : @xmath123 .",
    "this somewhat puzzling result can be given a physical interpretation in the context of the ideas presented here .",
    "there is no reason to suppose that the process of creating the thermodynamic volume need be adiabatic .",
    "the negative entropy of the spacetime would result from some heat flow of magnitude @xmath124 out of the volume .",
    "in fact , putting in the magnitude of our volume , @xmath122 , we find that the heat flow precisely matches the work done : @xmath125 , and so the internal energy was held constant in the formation process !",
    "a similar interpretation can be given to all the negative entropy cases following from equation  ( [ eq : taub - nut - entropy ] ) , _ i.e. _ , for @xmath126 .",
    "there is another way for the vector @xmath35 to degenerate , as already mentioned .",
    "it can have a two dimensional fixed point set , known as a bolt@xcite .",
    "so the metric function @xmath42 vanishes at some radius  @xmath107 that is greater than @xmath30 . ensuring a smooth metric again ,",
    "yields for the mass@xcite : @xmath127 with @xmath107 solving a quadratic equation , which gives @xmath107 in two branches : @xmath128 with @xmath30 restricted to be no greater than @xmath129 to have real @xmath107 greater than @xmath30 :    r0.4        @xmath130    the function @xmath131 is plotted in figure  [ fig : arbyplot ] . in fact , the mass also follows from the form of the action derived in ref.@xcite : @xmath132 where for this case we substitute @xmath133 and @xmath134 . ( the taub  nut action of the previous section comes from substituting @xmath135 and @xmath136 into this expression . ) we can go further and derive the entropy through the usual thermodynamic relation @xmath137 , giving : @xmath138\\ .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us next turn to the issue of the enthalpy and the thermodynamic volume for this spacetime in the extended thermodynamics .",
    "we propose that the bolt mass defines an enthalpy @xmath139 in the extended thermodynamics : @xmath140 where the explicit ( @xmath141 ) dependence follows from the fact that @xmath142 has an @xmath107 , @xmath30 , and @xmath143 dependence , as does @xmath144 .",
    "given that @xmath107 also depends on @xmath30 and @xmath143 , there are enough relations given the number of variables to ensure a well  defined @xmath50 , as in the taub ",
    "nut case .",
    "note that it is automatic that we can recover the temperature @xmath145 through the relation @xmath146 given that the derivatives used to recover @xmath147 and @xmath144 from the action were already performed by treating  @xmath143 ( and hence @xmath10 ) as a constant .",
    "taking an additional @xmath148 derivative on @xmath149 and on @xmath144 and using the chain rule then completes the demonstration .",
    "now we are ready to carry out the procedure done in the taub  nut case , holding @xmath7 fixed so that we can define the volume _ via _ : @xmath57 .",
    "we need the @xmath10 derivatives of @xmath30 and @xmath107 for fixed @xmath150 , and some tenacity in our algebra .",
    "this is where the smarr relation  ( [ eq : smarr ] ) , which follows entirely from scaling and so must be true here too , can be used to simplify matters considerably . since we have especially simple expressions for @xmath6 and @xmath10 , and we have @xmath149 and @xmath144 worked out already , we can extract the volume as @xmath151 , and a little algebra yields : @xmath152 a pleasingly simple formula . notice that it matches the formula that we anticipated at the end of subsection  [ eq : naive - volume ] by using an heuristic argument !",
    "some checks are in order .",
    "first , notice that our last few manipulations did not use the explicit form of the taub  bolt equation  ( [ eq : arbyquadratic ] ) for @xmath107 , and so this result is in fact true for the taub ",
    "nut case too , as can be seen by setting the radius to @xmath30 , upon which we recover equation  ( [ eq : taub - nut - volume ] ) .",
    "( this also fits with with our observation from subsection  [ eq : naive - volume ] that @xmath105 and @xmath102 can both come from the same integral formula . )",
    "second , notice that this result is manifestly positive , since the closest  @xmath107 can get to @xmath30 is asymptotically , at small @xmath30 : @xmath153 ( the lower branch solutions in figure  [ fig : arbyplot ] ) .",
    "third , for large @xmath107 ( the upper branch solutions in figure  [ fig : arbyplot ] , also at small  @xmath30 ) , the volume becomes the naive geometrical volume @xmath154 .",
    "away from the large @xmath107 limit , we see that we have found another example of a thermodynamic volume that is different from the naive geometric volume .",
    "this time instead of being due to rotation as in ref.@xcite , the discrepancy is due to the presence of nut charge .",
    "the volume @xmath105 has @xmath143 dependence through that of @xmath107 , while the volume for taub  nut , @xmath102 does not .",
    "it is amusing to note that in the asymptotically ( locally ) flat case , the limit @xmath155 ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath156 ) , the thermodynamic volumes for taub  nut and taub  bolt become equal in magnitude ( although opposite in sign in the sense discussed earlier ) , because @xmath157 and so : @xmath158 which gives a new reason why the nut and bolt spacetimes are somewhat complementary in their roles , like their ( pun  fuelled@xcite ) namesakes , nuts and bolts .    finally , we can define the internal energy for taub  bolt using @xmath62 , finding : @xmath159",
    "we ve found a very satisfying set of results for the physics of ads  taub ",
    "nut and ads  taub ",
    "bolt in the context of the extended thermodynamics where the cosmological constant defines a dynamical pressure .",
    "our core idea is that the extended thermodynamics should not be restricted to black hole spacetimes , but all gravitational spacetimes ( with or without horizons ) , taking seriously the relationship between mass and enthalpy@xcite .",
    "this is particularly natural since there are ways of defining intrinsic thermodynamic properties for spacetimes that arise from features that do not depend upon the presence of horizons , and the taub  nut and taub  bolt spacetimes are classic examples of this .    among the things we discovered",
    "were new examples of the thermodynamic volume being distinct from the naive geometric volume , as found for the rotating case in ref.@xcite .",
    "the presence of nut charge generates contributions to the thermodynamic volume , shows that they have a lot in common with the static case . ] . for the taub  nut case , we even had the extreme case that the naive geometric volume is zero , while the thermodynamic volume is in fact non  zero and negative . in our dynamical setting , we interpreted the negative sign as simply the result of the environment ( the rest of the universe ) doing work on the system to create the solution , which corresponds to the universe having had to increase its volume .",
    "mechanical work is entirely natural in this extended setting , as discussed and exploited in ref.@xcite .",
    "the picture we emphasise in all of this is that _ any _ gravity solution should be able to be thought of as a result of a thermodynamic process , and its thermodynamic properties interpreted in that light .",
    "one of the key points that emerges from this point of view is that certain puzzling thermodynamic features of the spacetimes are potentially explained in this setting : thermodynamic volumes can change dynamically ( in both directions ) , and heat flows in and out of such volumes also now have natural meaning .",
    "this gives a dynamical origin for negative entropy of a spacetime solution , for example .",
    "a core idea was to take seriously the relationship between mass and enthalpy in this dynamical setting for spacetimes beyond just black holes .",
    "it is to be expected that further work along these lines in other spacetime examples will yield similarly illuminating physics .",
