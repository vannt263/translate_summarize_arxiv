    ", the high - mass excess has been mitigated , but still grows very steeply with center of mass energy , and is 2.3 @xmath9 above the sm expectation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately d0 does not unfold their differential @xmath0 measurement , so it is not possible to directly compare their results in the high invariant mass range to those of cdf .",
    "d0 does , on the other hand , measure the lepton asymmetry in @xmath5 events , which provides a clean and theoretically sensitive cross check of the parent top asymmetry @xcite .",
    "d0 finds , in 5.4 fb@xmath6 , at production level @xmath10 , which is more than 3@xmath9 above the mc@nlo prediction of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , the significance of this result has also been reduced with the addition of more data . combining with measurement of the ( single ) lepton asymmetry in dileptonic top events , and including ew contributions in the sm prediction ,",
    "the updated result for the d0 single lepton asymmetry is reduced to @xmath12 , a 2.2@xmath9 discrepancy with the sm @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", cdf finds a @xmath13 excess from the sm in the background - subtracted @xmath14 with a sm prediction of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "while the deviation from sm predictions for the inclusive top forward - backward asymmetry does not have high significance , the consistency of the excess both across time and across experiments is a possible indication of a non - statistical origin for the asymmetry .",
    "the mystery is deepened by the excellent agreement of other top properties with the predictions of the sm , and in particular by the consistency of the @xmath16 production cross - section ( both inclusive and differential ) between theory and experiment .",
    ".recent measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath17 along with sm predictions . [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     besides the tevatron measurements , the most important constraints come from the lhc charge asymmetry and precision electroweak observables .",
    "the lhc charge asymmetry has the potential to severely constrain light axiglue models for @xmath0 , but the current spread in the central values measured by atlas and cms leaves the situation unsettled . future evolution towards the small values preferred by the current semileptonic measurement of cms would be devastating for flavor - universal models .",
    "precision electroweak constraints eliminate a significant corner of the very low - mass parameter space .",
    "we plot @xmath18 contours for asymmetry parameters and @xmath19 exclusion curves for precision electroweak ( pew ) ; for the tevatron cross - section , we use a 10% increase of lo @xmath20 as a benchmark . the 95% c.l .",

    "down - type nonuniversal models can ameliorate tension between lhc and tevatron top asymmetries , but are significantly more constrained by pew ; top non - universal models can evade constraints from pew , but do not help with the tension with the lhc @xmath25 .",

    "our conclusions are shown in the plots figs .",
    "[ fig : summary curves : flavor universal ] and [ fig : summary curves : flavor nonuniversal ] , which show the parameter space consistent with all constraints at 1@xmath9 .",

    "note in particular that for the flavor - universal and top nonuniversal models , the globally preferred region lies outside the 1-sigma band preferred by the cms @xmath25 measurement almost everywhere .",

    "the down - type nonuniversal models which can be brought into agreement with the cms asymmetry measurement encounter instead accentuated difficulty with pew constraints .",
    "axigluons remain one of the best options for explaining the tevatron forward - backward asymmetry with new physics .",
    "much of the parameter space has been closed , in particular for narrow axigluons , and additional avenues should also be sought to explain the signal observed by tevatron . while direct searches for broad axigluons are challenging and model dependent ,",
    "we have shown that indirect observables are capable of tightly constraining admissible windows without reference to any specific decay scenario .",
    "moreover , the combination of constraints from lhc charge asymmetries , pew observables , and the lepton asymmetry leaves no obvious flavor avenue open to escape the tightening net of indirect constraints .    _ acknowledgements : _ it is a pleasure to thank b.  dobrescu , m.  schmaltz , s.  westhoff , and d.  whiteson for useful conversations .",

    "in this section we review how to obtain axigluon models with small quark - axigluon couplings from a uv - complete description of spontaneous symmetry breakdown .",
    "we will neglect considerations of anomaly cancellation .    as discussed in section  [ sec : model ] , the minimal symmetry breaking structure that can realize a massive octet vector is @xmath28 . taking the breaking to be due to the vacuum expectation value of a bifundamental @xmath29 and denoting the coupling constants of the two groups as @xmath30 , the strong coupling constant is , as usual , g_s = g_1 , while the axigluon , @xmath31 , and sm gluon , @xmath32 , are given by the following linear combination of uv gauge fields g^&= & g_1 ^-",
    "g_2 ^ + g^ & = & g_1 ^+g_2 ^. the gluon remains massless , while the axigluon obtains a mass m_g = f .",
    "quark - axigluon couplings depend on the embedding of the sm quarks in the group @xmath33 .",
    "first consider a ( weyl ) quark @xmath34 transforming as a fundamental under @xmath35 .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breakdown , its coupling to the axigluon is _",
    "q1 = g_s g _ q^|^ q .",
    "meanwhile , a quark @xmath34 transforming as a fundamental under @xmath36 couples to the axigluon as _ q2 = - g_s g_q^|^ q . since if the left - handed fields couple to @xmath35 , the right - handed fields must couple to @xmath36 ( or vice - versa ) in order to get axial couplings to @xmath31 , we can thus see immediately that couplings of the left- and right - handed fields to the axigluon can not both be smaller than @xmath37 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to introduce heavy fermions that can mix with the sm quark fields and modify their axigluon couplings @xcite .    for definiteness consider the case where @xmath34 is a fundamental under @xmath38 and introduce @xmath39 transforming as a fundamental and an anti - fundamental respectively under @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 has the same @xmath42 quantum numbers as @xmath34 , and @xmath43 has the same @xmath42 quantum numbers as @xmath44 .",
    "then mixing can be obtained through the lagrangian _",
    "mix = |q ( m q + q ) + , where @xmath45 is the field responsible for the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath45 picks up its vev , @xmath47 , the resulting lagrangian is [ eq : lmix ] _ mix = |q q_h + |q q +  + , where the mass eigenstates @xmath48 , @xmath49 are given by q_h & = & q + q + q & = & - q + q in terms of the mixing angle = .",

    "the mixing angle @xmath50 is the necessary ingredient that allows us to freely dial the quark couplings to axigluons in the phenomenological low - energy lagrangian .",
    "however , once @xmath50 ( and @xmath51 ) are fixed , so are the off - diagonal @xmath49-@xmath34-@xmath31 couplings .",
    "this is particularly important for computing precision electroweak constraints , as we will discuss in the following section .",
    "in unitary gauge a convenient expression for the re - summed axigluon propagator is @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and we have defined m_g^2 . since all one - loop precision electroweak corrections of interest involve exactly one axigluon propagator , the finite width amplitude is thus related to the one - loop amplitude in the zero - width approximation , @xmath56 , via ( m_g^2 , _",
