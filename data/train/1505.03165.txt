    "* abdo et al . ( 2014 ) ) have shown that , for flares with a flux above 3 standard deviations from the baseline flux ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is greater than @xmath2 , suggesting the possible presence of emission processes additional to the ssc , for instance hadronic processes . if we consider that both leptonic and hadronic processes are responsible for the tev flares , we can write the @xmath4 as the sum of the leptonic and hadronic components ( @xmath5 and dc@xmath6 ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total observation period . therefore , we can estimate @xmath9 . to calculate @xmath10 we consider @xmath11 crab , corresponding to the mean of the gaussian function describing the baseline state of mrk 421 ( ) . for this value of @xmath3 , @xmath12 ( ( * ? ? ?",
