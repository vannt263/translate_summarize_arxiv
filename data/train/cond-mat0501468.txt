    "since long the ginzburg - landau model has been considered as paradigm for studying critical phenomena using field - theoretic techniques.@xcite perturbative calculations of critical exponents and amplitude ratios of the ising ( @xmath1 ) , xy ( @xmath2 ) , heisenberg ( @xmath3 ) and other o(@xmath4 ) spin models relied heavily on this field - theoretic formulation.@xcite even though the spin models contain only directional fluctuations , while for @xmath4-component ginzburg - landau fields with @xmath5 directional and size fluctuations seem to be equally important , the two descriptions are completely equivalent , as is expected through the concept of universality and has been proved explicitly for superfluids with @xmath2 , where the spin model reduces to an xy model.@xcite therefore it appeared as a surprise when , on the basis of an approximate variational approach to the two - component ginzburg - landau model , curty and beck @xcite recently predicted for certain parameter ranges the possibility of first - order phase transitions induced by phase fluctuations . in several papers @xcite this quasi - analytical @xcite prediction",
    "was tested by monte carlo simulations and , as the main result , apparently confirmed numerically .",
    "if true , these findings would have an enormous impact on the theoretical description of many related systems such as superfluid helium , superconductors , certain liquid crystals and possibly even the electroweak standard model of elementary particle physics.@xcite    in view of these potential important implications for a broad variety of different fields we performed independent monte carlo simulations of the standard ginzburg - landau model in two and three dimensions in order to test whether the claim of phase - fluctuation induced first - order transitions is a real effect or not.@xcite our results clearly support the prevailing opinion that the nature of the transition is of second order . in turn",
    "this implies , of course , that the variational approximation employed in ref .",
    "is less reliable than originally thought in view of the apparent numerical confirmations . in order to shed some light on the numerical results of refs .  , we generalized the standard model by adding a fugacity term which implicitly controls the vortex density of the model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present for this generalized ginzburg - landau model results on its phase structure as obtained from extensive monte carlo simulations . employing finite - size scaling analyses we find numerical evidence that , by tuning the extra fugacity parameter , it is indeed possible to drive the system into a region with first - order phase transitions .",
    "the layout of the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we first recall the standard model , and then discuss its generalization and the observables used to map out the phase diagram .",
    "next we describe the employed simulation techniques in sec .",
    "[ numer ] .",
    "the results of our simulations are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] , where we first discuss the three - dimensional case in some detail and then add a few brief comments on the two - dimensional model to complete the physical picture . finally , in sec .",
    "[ summary ] we conclude with a summary of our main findings .",
    "the standard complex or two - component ginzburg - landau theory is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath6 = \\int \\!\\ ! \\mathrm{d}^dr \\left[\\alpha |\\psi|^2 + \\frac{b}{2}|\\psi|^4 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}|\\nabla \\psi|^2 \\right ] , \\quad \\gamma > 0~ , \\label{eq : h}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are temperature independent coefficients derived from a microscopic model . in order to carry out monte carlo simulations we put the model ( [ eq : h ] ) on a @xmath10-dimensional hypercubic lattice with spacing @xmath11 . adopting the notation of ref .  , we introduce scaled variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mean - field correlation length at zero temperature .",
    "this leads to the normalized lattice hamiltonian @xmath15 = k_b \\tilde{v}_0   \\sum_{n=1}^n \\big [ \\frac{\\tilde{\\sigma}}{2 } ( |\\tilde{\\psi}_n|^2 - 1)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^d |\\tilde{\\psi}_n-\\tilde{\\psi}_{n+\\mu}|^2 \\big ] ~,\\ ] ] with @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the unit vectors along the @xmath10 coordinate axes , @xmath18 is the total number of sites , and an unimportant constant term has been removed .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 merely sets the temperature scale and can thus be absorbed in the definition of the reduced temperature @xmath20 .",
    "after these rescalings , and omitting the tilde on @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for notational simplicity in the rest of the paper , the partition function @xmath24 considered in the simulations is then given by @xmath25 where @xmath6 = \\sum_{n=1}^n \\big [ \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } ( |\\psi_n|^2 - 1)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^d |\\psi_n-\\psi_{n+\\mu}|^2 \\big ] \\label{eq : h_scal}\\ ] ] and @xmath26 stands short for integrating over all possible complex field configurations .    in ref .",
    "we have shown , that the disagreement mentioned above is caused by an incorrect sampling of the jacobian which emerges from the complex measure in ( [ eq : z ] ) when transforming the field representation to polar coordinates , @xmath27 . when updating in the simulations the modulus @xmath28 and the angle @xmath29 , one has to rewrite the measure of the partition function ( [ eq : z ] ) as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the jacobian of this transformation .",
    "while mathematically indeed trivial ( and of course properly taken into account in ref .  ) , this fact may easily be overlooked when coding the update proposals for the modulus and angle in a monte carlo simulation program . while for the angles it is correct to use update proposals of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is chosen such as to assure an optimal acceptance ratio ) , the similar procedure for the modulus , @xmath36 with @xmath37 , would be incorrect since this ignores the @xmath38 factor coming from the jacobian .",
    "in fact , if we purposely ignore the jacobian and simulate the model ( [ eq : z_r ] ) ( erroneously ) without the @xmath39-factor , then we obtain a completely different behavior than in the correct case , cf .",
    "e.g.  fig .",
    "[ pr ] below . as already mentioned above these results reproduce @xcite those in refs .   and , and",
    "from this data one would indeed conclude evidence for a first - order phase transition when @xmath22 is small . with the correct measure ,",
    "on the other hand , we have checked that _ no _ first - order signal shows up down to @xmath40 .    to treat the measure in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_r ] ) properly one can either use the identity @xmath41 and update the squared moduli @xmath42 according to a uniform measure ( where the update proposal @xmath43 with @xmath44 is correct ) , or one can introduce an effective hamiltonian , @xmath45 with @xmath46 and work directly with a uniform measure for @xmath38 .",
    "the incorrect omission of the @xmath39-factor in ( [ eq : z_r ] ) is equivalent to setting @xmath47 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the nodes @xmath48 correspond to core regions of vortices in the dual formulation of the model . the jacobian factor @xmath39 ( or equivalently the term @xmath49 in @xmath50 ) tends to suppress field configurations with many nodes @xmath48 . if the @xmath39-factor is omitted , the number of nodes and hence vortices is relatively enhanced .",
    "it is thus at least qualitatively plausible that in this case a discontinuous , first - order `` freezing transition '' from a vortex dominated phase can occur , as is suggested by a similar mechanism for the xy model @xcite and defect - models of melting @xcite .    in the limit of a large parameter @xmath22 , it is easy to read off from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_scal ] ) that the modulus of the field is squeezed onto unity and once hence expects that irrespectively of the value of @xmath51 the xy model limit is approached with its well - known continuous phase transition in three dimensions ( 3d ) at @xmath52 respectively kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition in two dimensions ( 2d ) at @xmath53 .",
    "while for the standard model with @xmath54 , this behavior should qualitatively persist for all values of @xmath22 , from the numerical results discussed above one expects that for @xmath47 the order of the transition turns first - order below a certain ( tricritical ) @xmath22-value .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to elucidate this behavior further by studying the phase diagram in the @xmath22-@xmath51-plane , i.e. , by considering an interpolating model with @xmath51 varying continuously between 0 and 1 .",
    "to be precise we always worked with the proper functional measure in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_r ] ) and replaced the standard hamiltonian @xmath55 by @xmath56 where we have introduced the parameter @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 ( @xmath54 ) corresponds to the standard model and @xmath59 ( @xmath47 ) to the previously studied modified model with its first - order phase transition for small enough @xmath22 .    in order to map out the phase diagram in the @xmath22-@xmath51- respectively @xmath22-@xmath60-plane , we have measured in our simulations to be described in detail in the next section among other quantities the energy density @xmath61 , the specific heat per site @xmath62 , and in particular the mean - square amplitude @xmath63 which will serve as the most relevant quantity for comparison with previous work @xcite . for further comparison and in order to determine the critical temperature , the helicity modulus , @xmath64 was also computed .",
    "notice that the helicity modulus @xmath65 is a direct measure of the phase correlations in the direction of @xmath17 .",
    "because of cubic symmetry all directions @xmath17 are equivalent , and we always quote the average @xmath66 . in the infinite - volume limit",
    ", @xmath67 is zero above @xmath68 and different from zero below @xmath68 .",
    "we also have measured the vortex density @xmath69 ( of vortex points in 2d and vortex lines in 3d ) .",
    "the standard procedure to calculate the vorticity on each plaquette is by considering the quantity @xmath70_{2\\pi}+[\\phi_2-\\phi_3]_{2\\pi}+[\\phi_3-\\phi_4]_{2\\pi}+[\\phi_4-\\phi_1]_{2\\pi})~,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 are the phases at the corners of a plaquette labeled , say , according to the right - hand rule , and @xmath72_{2\\pi}$ ] stands for @xmath73 modulo @xmath74 : @xmath72_{2\\pi}=\\alpha+2\\pi n$ ] , with @xmath4 an integer such that @xmath75 $ ] , hence @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath77 , there exists a vortex which is assigned to the object dual to the given plaquette ( a site in 2d and a link in 3d ) .",
    "hence , in two dimensions , @xmath78 , the dual of @xmath79 , is assigned to the center of the original plaquette . in three dimensions ,",
    "the topological point charges are replaced by ( oriented ) line elements @xmath80 which combine to form closed networks ( `` vortex loops '' ) .",
    "the vortex `` charges '' @xmath78 or @xmath80 can take three values : @xmath81 ( the values @xmath82 have a negligible probability ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath83 serve as a measure of the vortex density .",
    "we further analyzed the binder cumulant , @xmath84 where @xmath85 with @xmath86 is the magnetization per lattice site of a given configuration .",
    "let us now turn to the description of the monte carlo update procedures used by us . to be on safe grounds , we started with the most straightforward ( but most inefficient ) algorithm known since the early days of monte carlo simulations : the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite . here",
    "the complex field @xmath87 is decomposed into its cartesian components , @xmath88 . for each lattice site a random update proposal for the two components is made , e.g. @xmath89 with @xmath90 $ ] , and in the standard fashion accepted or rejected according to the energy change @xmath91 . the parameter @xmath92 is usually chosen such as to give an acceptance rate of about @xmath93 , but other choices are permissible and may even result in a better performance of the algorithm ( in terms of autocorrelation times ) .",
    "all this is standard @xcite and guarantees in a straightforward manner that the complex measure @xmath94 in the partition function ( [ eq : z ] ) is treated properly .",
    "the well - known drawback of this algorithm is its critical slowing down ( large autocorrelation times ) in the vicinity of a continuous phase transition @xcite , leading to large statistical errors for a fixed computer budget . to improve the accuracy of our data we therefore employed the single - cluster algorithm @xcite to update the direction of the field @xcite , similar to simulations of the xy spin model @xcite .",
    "the modulus of @xmath21 is updated again with a metropolis algorithm .",
    "here some care is necessary to treat the measure in ( [ eq : z ] ) properly ( see above comments ) . per measurement we performed one sweep with the metropolis algorithm and @xmath4 single - cluster updates .",
    "for all simulations in two and three dimensions the number of cluster updates was chosen such that @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the average cluster size .",
    "since @xmath96 scales with system size as the susceptibility , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 at the kosterlitz - thouless transition in 2d and @xmath99 in 3d , @xmath4 was chosen @xmath100 in 2d and @xmath101 in 3d .",
    "in the 2d case most of the simulations were performed for @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , and in 3d we usually studied the lattice sizes @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . for each simulation point",
    "we thermalized with 500 to @xmath106 sweeps and averaged the measurements over @xmath107 sweeps . in the cases of strong first - order phase transitions we employed a variant of the multicanonical scheme  @xcite where the histogram of the mean modulus is flattened instead that of the energy .",
    "all error bars are computed with the jackknife method @xcite . in the following",
    "we only show the more extensive and accurate data set of the cluster simulations , but we tested in many representative cases that the metropolis simulations coincide within error bars , for an example see fig .",
    "[ fig : metro ] .",
    "in the first set of simulations we concentrated on the two most characteristic cases @xmath47 and @xmath54 and performed temperature scans on a @xmath108 lattice for various values of the parameter @xmath22 . our results for the mean - square amplitude , the helicity modulus and the vortex - line density are compared for the two cases in fig .",
    "[ pr ] . in the plots for @xmath47 on the left side ,",
    "we see that all three quantities exhibit quite pronounced jumps for small @xmath22-values , which is a clear indication that in this regime the phase transition is of first order . at @xmath109 , for example , we observe already on very small lattices a clear double - peak structure for the distributions of the energy and mean - square amplitude as well as the mean modulus @xmath110 which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : histos ] . notice that already for the extremely small lattice size of @xmath111 the minimum between the two peaks is suppressed by more than 20 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is an unambiguous indication for two coexisting phases and thus clearly implies that the model undergoes a first - order phase transition in the small @xmath22-regime for @xmath112 .",
    "due to the pronounced metastability these simulations had to be performed with a variant of the multicanonical scheme  @xcite where , instead of flattening the energy histogram , extra weight factors for the mean modulus were introduced .",
    "with this simulation technique we overcome the difficulty of sampling the extremely rare events between the two peaks of the canonical distribution",
    ". a closer look at the @xmath112 plots shows that the crossover from second- to first - order transitions happens around @xmath113 . for the standard model with @xmath54 , on the other hand , we observe for _ all _ @xmath22-values a smooth behavior , suggesting that the xy model like continuous transition persists also for small @xmath22-values .",
    "this is clearly supported by a single - peak structure of all distributions just mentioned , for the case of the mean modulus see fig .",
    "[ fig : histos ] .",
    "this supports the prevailing opinion that the standard complex @xmath0 model always undergoes a second - order phase transition .",
    "in fact , we have checked that down to @xmath40 _ no _ signal of a first - order transition can be detected for the standard model parameterized by @xmath54 .",
    "the resulting transition lines in the @xmath22-@xmath23-plane for @xmath112 and @xmath54 are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_t_diag ] , with the thick line for @xmath47 indicating the approximate regime of first - order phase transitions .    next we concentrated on the small @xmath22 regime and performed a rough finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis for @xmath109 on moderately large @xmath114 , @xmath108 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 lattices . in fig .  [ fig_e ]",
    "we compare results for the energy , mean - square amplitude ( [ eq : mean_square ] ) , helicity modulus ( [ eq : helicity ] ) and vortex - line density ( [ eq : vortex3d ] ) for @xmath112 and @xmath117 . apart from the transition region where a strong size dependence is of course expected , we notice only a small dependence on the variation of the lattice size . on the basis of these results",
    ", we do not expect a significant change of the qualitative behavior for much larger lattices and hence used similar moderate lattice sizes for most of our further investigations .    to exemplify the big differences between the models with @xmath112 and @xmath117 , we choose in the following the case @xmath118 , where we shall characterize for both @xmath51-values the phase transitions in some detail . let us start with the non - standard case @xmath112 , where the first - order phase transition around @xmath119 is also pronounced but much less strong than for @xmath120 .",
    "still , in order to get sufficiently accurate equilibrium results , the simulations for lattices of size @xmath121 , and @xmath122 had to be performed again with our modulus variant of the multicanonical method . as can be inspected in the histogram plots for the mean modulus shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inter ] , the frequency of the rare events between the two peaks in the canonical ensemble for a @xmath123 lattice is about 50 orders of magnitude smaller than for configurations contributing to the two peaks .    in order to characterize the transition",
    "more quantitatively we estimated the interface tension@xcite , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the value of the two peaks and @xmath126 denotes the minimum in between .",
    "here we have assumed that for each lattice size the temperature was chosen such that the two peaks are of equal height which can be achieved by histogram reweighting .",
    "the thus defined temperatures approach the infinite - volume transition temperature as @xmath127 , and for the final estimate of @xmath128 , we performed a fit according to@xcite @xmath129 as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inter ] , the finite - lattice estimates @xmath130 are clearly nonzero . the infinite - volume extrapolation ( [ eq : inter_fss ] )",
    "tends to increase with system size and yields a comparably large interface tension of @xmath131 .",
    "let us now turn to the second generic case , @xmath117 , where the model definitely exhibits for @xmath118 a second - order phase transition around @xmath132 . to confirm the expected critical exponents of the o(2 ) or xy model universality class , we simulated here close to criticality somewhat larger lattices of size @xmath133 , and @xmath134 and performed a standard fss analysis . from short runs",
    "we first estimated the location of the phase transition to be at @xmath135 . in",
    "the long runs at @xmath136 we recorded the time series of the energy density @xmath137 , the magnetization @xmath138 , the mean modulus @xmath139 , and the mean - square amplitude@xcite @xmath140 , as well as the helicity modulus @xmath65 and the vorticity @xmath69 . after an initial equilibration time we took about @xmath141 measurements for each lattice size . applying the reweighting technique we first determined the maxima of the susceptibility , @xmath142 , of @xmath143 , and of the logarithmic derivatives @xmath10ln@xmath144 and @xmath10ln@xmath145 . the locations of these maxima provide us with four sequences of pseudo - transition points @xmath146 for which the scaling variable @xmath147 should be constant .",
    "using this fact we then have several possibilities to extract the critical exponent @xmath148 from ( linear ) least - squares fits of the fss ansatz @xmath149 or @xmath10ln@xmath150 to the data at the various @xmath146 sequences .",
    "the quality of our data and the fits starting at @xmath151 , with goodness - of - fit parameters @xmath152 , can be inspected in fig .",
    "[ fig_nu ] .",
    "all resulting exponent estimates and consequently also their weighted average , @xmath153 are in perfect agreement with recent high - precision monte carlo estimates for the xy model universality class.@xcite note that hyperscaling implies @xmath154 , which also favorably compares with recent spacelab experiments on the lambda transition in liquid helium.@xcite    assuming thus @xmath155 we can improve our estimate for @xmath156 from linear least - squares fits to the scaling behavior of the various @xmath157 sequences .",
    "the combined estimate from the four sequences is @xmath158 . to extract the critical exponent ratio @xmath159",
    "we can now use the scaling relation for the susceptibility @xmath160 at @xmath156 .",

    "still , these results are in good agreement with recent high - precision estimates in the literature @xcite and clearly confirm the expected second - order nature of the phase transition in the standard complex @xmath0 model , governed by xy model critical exponents .    a similar set of simulations at @xmath109 for lattice sizes @xmath166 , and @xmath103 gave the exponent estimates @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 $ ] ( at @xmath170 ) , which are less accurate but again compatible with the xy model universality class . at any rate these results definitely rule out the possibility of a first - order phase transition in the standard model at small @xmath22-values .",
    "when going to even smaller @xmath22-values , the fss analysis is more and more severely hampered by the vicinity of the gaussian fixed point which induces strong crossover scaling effects . since consequently very large system sizes would be required to see the true , asymptotic ( xy model like ) critical behavior we have not further pursued our attempts in this direction .",
    "here we only add the remark that for @xmath40 the energy and magnetization distributions exhibit a clear single - peak structure for all considered lattice sizes up to @xmath171 , showing that in the standard model with @xmath54 a phase - fluctuation induced first - order phase transition is very unlikely even for very small @xmath22 values .",

    "note in particular that ( only ) the data for @xmath54 are compatible with the expected universal jump of the helicity modulus at @xmath68 , @xmath196 , indicated by the straight line in the corresponding plots . a careful investigation of the first - order transitions in the generalized model with @xmath47 will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the possibility of a phase - fluctuation induced first - order phase transition in the standard three - dimensional ginzburg - landau model as suggested by approximate variational calculations @xcite can not be confirmed by our numerical simulations down to very small values of the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "our results suggest , however , that a generalized ginzburg - landau model can be tuned to undergo first - order transitions by a mechanism similar to that discussed in ref .   when varying the parameter @xmath51 of an additional @xmath197 term in the generalized hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_gen ] ) .",
    "as in ref .   this can be understood by a duality argument . for @xmath198",
    "the extra term reduces the ratio of core energies of vortex lines of vorticity two versus those of vorticity one , and this leads to the same type of transition as observed in defect melting of crystals .",
    "the phase transitions of the standard model as well as the continuous transitions of the generalized model are confirmed to be governed by the critical exponents of the xy model or o(2 ) universality class , as expected by general symmetry arguments . for the generalized model it would be interesting to analyze in more detail the tricritical points separating the regions with first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "such a study , however , is quite a challenging project and hence left for the future .",
    "exploratory simulations of the two - dimensional case , where the standard model exhibits kosterlitz - thouless transitions , indicate that a similar mechanism can drive the transition of the generalized model to first order also there .",

    "<S> we employ monte carlo simulations to study a generalized three - dimensional complex @xmath0 theory of ginzburg - landau form and compare our numerical results with a recent quasi - analytical mean - field type approximation , which predicts first - order phase transitions in parts of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown earlier , this approximation does not apply to the standard formulation of the model . </S>",
    "<S> this motivated us to introduce a generalized hamiltonian with an additional fugacity term controlling implicitly the vortex density . with this modification </S>",
    "<S> we find that the complex @xmath0 theory can , in fact , be tuned to undergo strong first - order phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the standard model is confirmed to exhibit continuous transitions which can be characterized by xy model exponents , as expected by universality arguments . </S>",
    "<S> a few remarks on the two - dimensional case are also made . </S>"
