    "the dimensionality of a physical system is an essential parameter reflecting its spatial scaling properties .",
    "the dimension influences the behavior near a critical point , affecting the scaling of various static and dynamic physical quantities  @xcite .",
    "magnetic systems can be considered as a classic example , but in the last decades the concepts and methodology of critical behavior have been successfully applied to macroscopic and real - world inspired systems too @xcite .",
    "recently , the connection between criticality and dimensionality has also been extensively studied in the context of complex networks  @xcite .    for general abstract networks",
    "however , it is not straightforward to obtain a proper definition of dimensionality . during the last several years , there appeared a number of methods that were successful in identifying scaling laws in complex networks , giving suitable generalizations of existing concepts of dimensionality  @xcite .",
    "recently , these methods were also adapted to include global spatial information present in spatially embedded networks  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the feasibility of a dimensionality measurement for complex networks that relies merely on _ local _ information .",
    "to do so , we give a generalization of the spectral dimension  @xcite to record what a random walker `` perceives '' while traversing the network .",
    "while a random walk is not a realistic model for every possible process taking place on a network , it is suitable to gain some information about the structure of the network .",
    "both the random walk process and the concept of spectral dimension have been successfully applied to networks previously  @xcite .",
    "now , we refine the concept of spectral dimension to include the information present in distances or delays associated with the links , gaining a more complete measure of network dimensionality .",
    "our new approach is readily applicable to spatially embedded networks , and additionally it allows the treatment of partially embedded networks , where the embedding information is only present as link - wise properties ( e.g. distances or delays ) .",
    "these networks can be considered a special kind of weighted networks , where the link weights are related to the time needed to traverse the link .",
    "note that we use the weights as generalized distances , which is fundamentally different from the treatment of networks with arbitrary weighted links  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for considering such networks is twofold .",
    "first , for many real - world networks the spatial embedding is only partially feasible in practice .",
    "for instance , let us suppose a traversal or transport process taking place on a complex network lacking spatial information . as a result , we can generally obtain some sort of local , link - wise information ( e.g.  `` delivery times '' along the links ) , but without gaining any global knowledge on the physical layout of the network .",
    "in such situations , we can assign the measured link - wise property to each link to obtain a _ partial embedding _ of the network .",
    "a straightforward illustration is the internet , where delays are relatively easy to measure , but reliably determining the geographic position of the nodes is not feasible on a large scale @xcite . for similar partially embedded networks",
    ", a random walk processes can effectively utilize local knowledge to characterize the large - scale structure of the system .",
    "another motivation is for `` fully '' embedded networks .",
    "even if there exists a natural ( 2 or 3d ) embedding space for the network in question , it may still be relevant to study the network s scaling behavior via local , link - wise properties .",
    "as an example , imagine a typical road network , where different types of roads have different speed limits .",
    "in such a network , travel times are not in a simple relationship with the metric distance of the embedding space ( the length of road segments between two intersections ) .",
    "it is meaningful to investigate scaling in the light of the `` overlay '' property ( travel time ) , instead of the metric distance .",
    "our method can be considered as an extension of the classical diffusion problem . on an abstract network",
    "the diffusion process is usually considered as the function of the discrete time steps taken ( i.e. the number of hops ) . in the case of an embedded network",
    "however , there is a natural time - scale and the delays suffered while traversing the links are directly related to the structural properties of the network . if the link delays have a broad distribution , the dynamics of the resulting process will significantly differ from the standard diffusion where each step takes the same amount of time .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec_relwork ] we give a general overview on network dimension measurements and in sect .  [ sec_method ] we review those that utilize a random walk process .",
    "we introduce our method for partially embedded networks in sect .",
    "[ sec_tau ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec_results ] , we present simulation results for synthetic and real - world networks , and compare the findings for the presented methods .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in sect .",
    "[ sec_discussion ] .",
    "in the last several years , a number of methods have appeared in the literature that were successful in identifying scale - invariant properties in small - world complex networks .",
    "probably , the earliest such concept is the _ spectral dimension _  @xcite which originates from random walks on the network ( see sect .  [ sec_method ] ) , and was applied to both theoretical models of networks  @xcite and empirical datasets  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the application of the box - counting dimension  @xcite to networks was also proposed  @xcite , and further generalized to reveal fractal properties of complex networks  @xcite . the scaling exponents arising from these methods",
    "are usually interpreted as a special type of network dimension .    beyond these methods , which handle networks as abstract graphs ,",
    "there have been an increasing interest in including the spatial properties of networks , too ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , in the context of dimension measurements , the presence of spatial information enables the application of well - known approaches @xcite to determine the fractal dimension of the point set of network nodes @xcite .",
    "a shortcoming of these approaches may be , that while they take into account the geometric layout of the network , they entirely neglect its connectivity information .",
    "recently , in @xcite daqing _ et al . _  have proposed more suitable methods to overcome this limitation .",
    "the authors combine _ both _ metric and topological knowledge to yield more comprehensive measures of dimensionality .      a principal method to define the dimensionality of an abstract graph",
    "is performed by examining the properties of a random walk process .",
    "we define a graph @xmath1 with a set of nodes @xmath2 and a set of edges @xmath3 between the nodes .",
    "an edge is an unordered pair @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are distinct nodes from @xmath2 ( the edges are undirected , and we do not allow self - edges ) .",
    "the graph can be represented by its adjacency matrix @xmath7 , where @xmath8 if there is an edge between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and otherwise @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the degree matrix of @xmath1 , the diagonal matrix with entries @xmath11 .",
    "the spectral dimension can be estimated from the scaling behavior of the probability that a random walker returns to the origin of the walk  @xcite .",
    "we can define the transition probability from node @xmath5 to @xmath6 in @xmath12 steps : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the transition matrix of the process",
    ".    we will be interested in the @xmath15 _ return probability _ of the walk , that is the average probability that the random walk returns to the origin after @xmath12 steps ( the average goes over all possible @xmath5 starting nodes ) .",
    "if the return probability exhibits a @xmath16 scaling for a sufficiently large range , we define the spectral dimension of @xmath1 as @xmath17 . if @xmath1 is a @xmath18-dimensional regular lattice , then @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we note that the spectral dimension concept is closely related to the spectral density function of the transition matrix . in the continuous limit",
    ", @xmath20 arises as the laplace - transform of the spectral density  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the spectra of various matrices associated with a network have been intensively studied , also in the context of diffusion  @xcite and the spectral dimension was found to be a valuable tool to describe topological properties of real - world networks  @xcite .",
    "a more exotic case is that of quantum gravity , where the spectral dimension of the networks defined by the possible triangulations of space - time can be interpreted as the perceived dimension of the universe  @xcite .",
    "a possible generalization of @xmath21 to spatially embedded networks is given in  @xcite .",
    "a graph @xmath1 is said to be embedded into a metric space @xmath22 if each node in @xmath2 corresponds to a point in @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a metric on @xmath23 , i.e. for each pair of nodes @xmath5 and @xmath6 we have a distance @xmath25 . in a general setting",
    "@xmath24 is the two or three dimensional euclidean distance , but for many large - scale real world networks it is the spherical distance that plays the role of @xmath24 .    in case of an embedded graph , the random walk process can be interpreted as a diffusion in the embedding space @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , we can measure the exponent of the diffusion on the embedded graph via the scaling relation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the root mean square ( r.m.s . ) displacement of the random walker at time @xmath12 : @xmath28 the diffusion exponent is @xmath29 for regular lattices in any dimension , while for real world systems it often exhibits anomalous behavior with @xmath30 @xcite .    the spectral dimension concept employed by daqing _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite can be extracted from the scaling relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "here , the exponent gives an alternative measure for the dimension of the network : @xmath33 .",
    "in the case where the three scaling laws ( eqs .",
    "( [ spectraldim ] ) ,  ( [ diff ] ) and  ( [ daqing ] ) ) are all valid in the same range , the three exponents are related : @xmath34 . for regular @xmath18 dimensional lattices",
    "this relationship is satisfied as @xmath35 and @xmath36 . nevertheless , for more complex networks , the scaling regimes may not coincide , or some of the scaling relationships might not hold at all .",
    "a remarkable result of @xcite is that the authors demonstrate , that the @xmath37 distribution of link lengths has a central role in controlling the dimensionality of a spatial network .",
    "inspired by that result , we also pay special attention to the distribution of link lengths of the networks considered .",
    "we emphasize , that the distribution of link lengths can be defined in two different ways . throughout this paper , by @xmath37 we refer to the _ observed _ distribution , i.e.  the probability that a link in the network has length @xmath24 . instead of @xmath37",
    ", many authors also use the @xmath38 _ conditional _ version : the probability that two nodes are connected given that they are separated by distance @xmath24 .",
    "the two definitions are not independent : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the distribution of distances among any two points regardless of whether there is a link between them or not . for a set of uniformly distributed points in @xmath18 dimensions",
    ", we have @xmath41 and thus @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "the nodes in a real - world spatially embedded network are in many cases inhomogeneously distributed , which complicates the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 . to this end",
    ", we only use the observed distribution @xmath37 as it can be estimated directly from the data .    based on empirical observations ,",
    "@xmath37 is often assumed to follow a power law decay : @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the special case of @xmath44 has been of interest from both theoretical and empirical perspective . in his seminal paper",
    "@xcite , kleinberg showed that for an important family of small - world networks the @xmath45 exponent is controlling the navigability of the network : at @xmath46 efficient routing is achievable based merely on local information , while if @xmath47 , this is not feasible .",
    "( note , that kleinberg used the @xmath38 conditional version of the link length distribution and thus stated his results for @xmath48 in two dimensions . ) kleinberg s results are in agreement with the empirical finding that in many real - world networks , @xmath49 .",
    "early evidence for the internet was found by yook _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which has also been recently supplemented by more precise measurements by the authors of the present paper  @xcite .",
    "the same phenomenon was also observed in social networks  @xcite , mobile communication networks  @xcite , and e - mail networks  @xcite .",
    "very recently , in  @xcite hu _ et  al . _  proposed a statistical model which reproduces this peculiar scaling phenomenon .",
    "the authors found that the @xmath50 behavior arises naturally from an entropy - maximization constraint .",
    "the internet infrastructure and the geosocial network used in our analysis can also be well characterized by @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lld ] ) .",
    "on an abstract network in @xmath51 . here , the @xmath21 spectral dimension can be calculated via the monte carlo simulation of eq .",
    "( [ spectraldim ] ) .",
    "( b ) if the network is embedded into a metric space , we can obtain @xmath52 ( and generally @xmath53 for any node pair ) , hence it is feasible to determine @xmath54 via eq .",
    "( [ daqing ] ) .",
    "( c ) in case the network is only partially embedded , @xmath52 is not available generally , and thus it is not possible to obtain @xmath54 .",
    "however , if a @xmath55 length ( or delay ) function is present for the links , we are able to cumulate the @xmath55 values along the walk to obtain @xmath56 via eq .",
    "( [ taudim ] ) . in this particular case @xmath57 . ]    in the following , we propose a new method to measure the dimensionality of spatially embedded networks , which can also be generalized to the special type of networks which we refer to as _ partially embedded_.    this class of networks lies in - between abstract networks ( with topological information only ) and spatial networks ( with both topological and embedding information ) .",
    "these networks emerge either when the @xmath25 distances are not available generally , but only for connected node pairs ( i.e.  when @xmath58 ) , or when we wish to study the network as per a link - wise overlay property possibly different from @xmath24 ( e.g. link - wise delays ) . this relaxation yields networks that are spatially constrained to some extent , but the embedding information is incomplete , as the nodes do not have coordinates .",
    "due to their transient character , we refer to these networks as _ partially embedded networks_. to distinguish spatially embedded networks from partially embedded networks , we refer to the link length function in a partially embedded network as @xmath59 , which needs to be defined only for the edges of the network   and @xmath55 can denote the length of a link , we use @xmath55 to emphasize when the distance needs to be defined only for the edges of the network .",
    "also , for a spatially embedded network we can define @xmath55 as an arbitrary function of @xmath24 . ] .    to estimate the dimensionality of such networks , we consider random walks similarly to sect .",
    "[ sec_method ] , and exploit the inherent information in the @xmath55 measure",

    "we can measure the cumulated length of a walk @xmath64 consisting of @xmath65 steps as @xmath66 considering only walks which return to the origin , we denote the distribution of the lengths of such walks by @xmath67 .",
    "we are then interested in the scaling relation : @xmath68    where the proposed dimension measure can be estimated as @xmath69 ( if @xmath67 exhibits scaling in a suitably large range ) .",
    "note , that this definition resembles that of the spectral dimension .",
    "indeed , eq  ( [ taudim ] ) can be interpreted as a generalization of eq  ( [ spectraldim ] ) .",
    "assuming that the random walker travels with unit velocity , it is natural to interpret the @xmath70 distance as the `` elapsed time '' as perceived by the random walker while traversing the link between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , by @xmath73 we achieve a dimension concept that grasps the network s large - scale spatial structure through _ local _ characteristics observed by a random walker .",
    "trivially , for a regular @xmath18-dimensional lattice @xmath74 , which gives @xmath75 . on a network , where the distribution of @xmath55 link lengths has a finite second moment , the @xmath74 relation will be a good approximation for large @xmath12 because of the central limit theorem .",
    "if the link length distribution is broad ( no finite second moment , e.g. a power law with an exponent @xmath76 ) , this will not be true ; even for large @xmath12 , there will be a significant difference based on whether we examine the diffusion process as a function of steps taken or elapsed time .",
    "our goal with the new dimension measure is to take these effects into account .",

    "we generated spatially embedded random networks with a given link length distribution , following the method of  @xcite .",

    "this is in accordance with the fact that with increasing values of @xmath45 , there will be fewer long - range links and the network will be dominated by short - range links , which augment the underlying two dimensional structure . in the @xmath46 case",

    "a similar phenomenon can be observed for the @xmath54 dimension in fig .",

    "considering the @xmath56 dimension , we can again identify the two scaling regimes , with the boundary at @xmath117 , the approximate size of the system . similarly to the internet , we have @xmath128 , giving @xmath119 for the @xmath129 range .",
    "for the longer walks , we get @xmath130 giving @xmath131 , which is again larger than the embedding dimension , and is approximately the same as @xmath21 .    based on our results",
    ", we argue that some , but not all of the qualitative aspects of the real - world networks can be explained with the effect of the very broad @xmath44 link length distribution .",
    "similarly to the random networks , @xmath56 shows the same separation of length scales , and again we find that @xmath54 is not applicable here .",
    "however , for the investigated real - world networks , @xmath54 exhibits a clear exponential decay which was not the case for the synthetic network .",
    "also , @xmath56 behaves in a quantitatively different way : the arising @xmath132 exponents differ significantly from the synthetic case , and also between the two real - world networks .",
    "regarding the @xmath112 spectral dimension , we find significantly better scaling compared to the synthetic case .",
    "these observations mean that the link length distribution is not sufficient in itself to entirely control the dimensionality of complex networks , but further structural properties are also expected to have a traceable effect . in case of @xmath56 ,",
    "these hidden structural characteristics can be approached via the varying significance of the different terms in eq .",
    "( [ tausor ] ) .",
    "a rather interesting property is that for the @xmath133 range both of our real - world networks give @xmath128 , implying @xmath119 , matching the embedding dimension of the system . in both networks ,",
    "the link length distribution can be well approximated by @xmath134 . using this ,",
    "the scaling @xmath135 can be explained by the arguments presented in sect .",
    "[ sec_tr ] , based on eq .",
    "( [ tausor ] ) .",
    "still , the synthetic random networks produce different exponents , meaning that this peculiar property arises only in both real - world networks of different origin .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a generalization of the spectral dimension of networks .",
    "contrary to recently proposed methods to measure the dimension of spatially embedded networks @xcite , our method does not utilize global information on the embedding ( i.e. the distance between any two nodes in the network ) . the key idea behind our method is to exploit _ local _ , link - wise information arising naturally from a random walk process on the network .",
    "consequently , the new dimension concept grasps the large - scale structure as seen `` from the eyes of the random walker '' .",
    "this means that the real time dynamics of the random walk process is taken into account instead of only using the abstract `` diffusion time '' ( i.e. the number of steps taken ) .",
    "an appealing property of this method is that it can be readily applied to _ partially embedded networks _ , where distances or delays are only available as a link - wise property and not generally .",
    "in the case of a spatially embedded network , these delays can be a simple function of the distances between the nodes , but we can utilize arbitrary delays possibly arising from physical processes on the network .",
    "a consequence of this relaxation is that this link - wise property does not need to qualify as a metric in a mathematical sense .",
    "indeed , in many real - world settings delays can violate the triangle inequality , as taking a `` detour '' may result in less accumulated delay .    to compare our dimension concept ( @xmath56 ) with the classical spectral dimension ( @xmath21 ) and the method of daqing _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( @xmath54 ) , we considered a spatially embedded random network , and different real - world networks : road networks , internet routers and the gowalla geosocial network .",
    "we used the road networks as benchmarks , since they substantially resemble a two dimensional lattice . as expected , all three methods provide dimensions @xmath136",
    ". we also studied the effect of coarse graining the road networks and found that in most cases the methods yield similar results .",
    "our random networks were generated to have a scale - free distribution of link lengths : @xmath43 .",
    "we found that for exponents @xmath94 all methods exhibit scaling , and in accordance with @xcite , the value of @xmath45 directly affects the measured dimension of the network .",
    "contrary to previous works that we are aware of , in this paper we have also considered the theoretically and empirically designated case of @xmath46 . for this very broad distribution of link lengths , @xmath21 and @xmath54 decay faster than a power law , and thus can be considered infinite .",
    "interestingly , @xmath56 remains finite , but there appears a separation of length scales with two different exponents . in accordance with several empirical studies @xcite , our internet and gowalla dataset can also be well characterized by @xmath137 .",
    "an important empirical result of our paper is that while for these networks @xmath138 can be considered infinite , @xmath56 remains finite , with similar scaling regimes which are again separated by the approximate size of the system .    for the internet",
    ", this seems to contradict the previous result of  @xcite , where @xmath139 was found to be @xmath140 .",
    "a possible explanation for this mismatch lies in the nature of the data sets applied .",
    "for instance , there is a significant difference in the distribution of link lengths : in  @xcite , the authors find @xmath141 .",
    "exponent used in  @xcite corresponds to the conditional probability , what they estimate based on the assumption that the network nodes are uniformly distributed . ]",
    "we believe that due to the applied geolocalization technique , our data set is more accurate in terms of the geographic position of the nodes  @xcite .    comparing the results for the real - world and synthetic networks in the @xmath44 case , we find a qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "while @xmath54 is not applicable , for @xmath73 there emerge two scaling regimes with different exponents , separated by the system size . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath21 is apparently different : in real - world networks there appears a limited scaling regime , which is absent in the synthetic setting .",
    "furthermore , even the behavior of @xmath73 is quantitatively different : the arising exponents differ both between the synthetic and real world case , and between the two real - world networks .",
    "this result implies that an uncorrelated random network model is not able to reproduce the structure of a real network with a similar @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in spite of its distinguished significance , the link length distribution is not sufficient in itself to characterize the dimensionality of a complex network .",
    "our results show that the time dynamics of the diffusion is indeed a very important aspect . in the classical case of diffusion",
    ", each step takes the same amount of time . in this case",
    "we can take the continuous time limit , which gives a markovian master equation for the evolution of the probability distribution  @xcite . the spectral dimension in this case",
    "can also be extracted from the spectral density of the transition matrix  @xcite . in the case of diffusion",
    "taking place on a network with non - uniform transmission delays on the links , the continuous time limit would result in a delay - differential equation  @xcite .",
    "further research could clarify the relation between the spectrum of arising from these equations and the dimension concept introduced in our paper .",
