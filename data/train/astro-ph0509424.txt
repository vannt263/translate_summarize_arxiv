    "one of the enduring mysteries of cosmic gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is that of the so - called `` dark '' bursts - those with no detected optical or near - infrared afterglows . in the fireball model of grbs",

    "internal shocks within the blast wave are the source of the high energy prompt emission while afterglows arise from external shocks when the blast wave run into an interstellar medium .",
    "grbs may be divided into `` long - duration '' and `` short - duration '' categories ; no unambigous detection of an optical afterglow has yet been made for any short - duration event ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and only in one case has an x - ray afterglow been detected @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , virtually all of the long - duration bursts display fading soft x - ray afterglows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and they have been shown to be associated with supernova explosions @xcite .    for more than half of the long - duration grbs",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , rapid and systematic follow - up of bursts has decreased the relative fraction of dark bursts in recent years @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested using the value of the optical - to - x - ray spectral index as a diagnostic for early identification of dark bursts , and they found five dark bursts ( including grb  001025a ) in their sample of 52 bursts .",
    "there are several possible explanations for dark bursts @xcite",
    ". they could be at very high redshifts @xcite , or they could be heavily obscured by dust in their host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they could also occur in regions where the surrounding medium is tenuous , far from the centers of their host galaxies , where the strong shocks required for particle acceleration could not form @xcite .",
    "observations of bursts detected by the _ bepposax _ , the _ high energy transient explorer _ , and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ spacecrafts have indeed shown that bursts can be dark for a variety of reasons .",
    "some bursts seem in fact to be dark due to extinction , e.g. grb  000210 @xcite , grb  970828 @xcite , and grb  001109 @xcite .",
    "other bursts have faint optical afterglows either because of moderately high redshift , e.g. , grb  020124 @xcite , or because they are intrinsically faint without extinction , e.g. grb  980613 @xcite and grb  021211 @xcite .",
    "analysis of bursts detected by _",
    "swift _ will undoubtly shed more light on the nature of dark bursts .",
    "already now it has become evident that afterglows of bursts detected by",
    "_ swift _ on average are fainter than afterglows from bursts detected by previous instruments ( 1.7  magnitudes in the optical / near - infrared ( berger et al . , 2005 ) and a factor three in x - rays jakobsson , 2005 ) .",
    "the rapid fading of some _ swift _ bursts demonstrates that at least these become intrinsically faint after the first few hundred seconds @xcite .",
    "here we examine the case of the dark burst grb  001025a .",
    "we report on our temporal and spectral analysis of the prompt emission , on our very deep optical upper limits on the afterglow , and on the results of our temporal and spectral analysis of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "finally , we discuss the nature of grb  001025a within the framework of the fireball model , and the implications for dark bursts in general .",
    "grb  001025a was first reported as an event detected by the _ rossi x - ray transient explorer ( rxte ) all sky monitor ( asm ) at 11405  s  ut october  25 , 2000 @xcite .",
    "its duration in the asm 1.512 kev energy band was @xmath215 s , and its peak flux was @xmath2 4 crab ( @xmath3 ) in the 512 kev band .",
    "the event was detected by a single camera and localized to a @xmath4 error box .",
    "it was also observed by _",
    "ulysses _ , the x - ray / gamma - ray spectrometer ( xgrs ) aboard the _ near earth asteroid rendezvous mission ( near ) , and _ wind ( konus experiment ) in the interplanetary network ( ipn ) , and triangulated to a preliminary @xmath5 wide annulus which crossed the asm error box to form a 25  arcminute@xmath6 error box @xcite . _ _ _    we have used the final _ ulysses _ , near , and _",
    "wind_-konus data to obtain a refined ipn error box for this burst",
    ". the _ ulysses - konus annulus is centered at r.a.(2000)@xmath7 , decl.@xmath8 , and has a radius of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the _ ulysses _ - near annulus is centered at r.a.@xmath11 , decl.(2000)@xmath12 , and has a radius of @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "the intersection of these annuli defines a 96  arcminute@xmath6 error box .",
    "however , the intersection of the _ ulysses_-konus annulus with the asm error box defines a 3.3  arcminute@xmath6 error box , whose coordinates are given in table  [ error ] .",

    "i.e. , the time to accumulate between 5% and 95% of the photons ) in the 50200 kev energy range , this burst falls into the `` long - duration '' category .",
    "figure  [ all_time ] shows the lightcurve in several energy ranges , and indicates the intervals used for time - resolved spectral analysis .",
    "this figure also shows the hardness ratio as a function of time .",
    "a hard - to - soft evolution , which is often observed in grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is evident .",
    "the energy spectra are presented in figure  [ konus_spec ] . the band @xcite model , which consists of two smoothly joined power laws , was used to perform spectral fits .",

    "the 152000 kev peak flux of this burst was @xmath18 over 0.048  s , and the 152000 kev fluence was @xmath19 . neither the time history , nor the spectrum , nor the intensity of this event was exceptional in any way .",
    "@xcite has proposed a simple redshift estimator based on the photon flux , energy spectrum , and duration of a grb . using this method ,",
    "we obtain @xmath20 , with a statistical uncertainty of about 50% .      in the weeks immediately following grb  001025a , optical , x - ray , and radio observations were carried out in attempts to identify an afterglow .",
    "an optical afterglow was not identified , either in observations starting 1.16  days after the burst ( * ? ? ?",

    "the first vla observation took place november  1 , 2000 , approximately 6 days after the grb ( d.  frail 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "unfortunately , the _ xmm - newton _",
    "attitude was subsequently revised @xcite , and the refined position of s1 was @xmath24 from the initial one . due to the off - set between the vla pointing and the revised position of s1 , the vla sensitivity at the position of s1 was relatively low .",
    "vla observations took place again on november  21 and 24 , 2000 ( 2730 days after the burst ) , but given the timescales and sensitivies ( @xmath25 ) most grb radio afterglows would not have been detected .",
    "thus it is not clear whether this burst was radio - quiet .    in the following three sections , we present our analysis and results of optical observations and x - ray observations of the grb  001025a afterglow .",

    "the first epoch was a few hours after the release of the ipn error box ( hurley et al .",
    "2000 ) , the second epoch was 24  hours later , and the final epoch was 5 months later .    by comparing the combined @xmath1-band images of the three epochs we find no transient sources in the ipn error box and in particular near the _ xmm - newton _ error circle of s1 to a 3@xmath26 detection limit of @xmath0 .",

    "the failure to detect the optical afterglow of grb  001025a is thus not because our observations are less sensitive than studies of other detected grb afterglows .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ carried out observations of the region around the error box at three different epochs , spanning 1.92.3 days , 761.0761.2 days , and 910.2910.4 days after the grb ( see table  [ xmmlog ] ) .",

    "this , along with marginal evidence for a fading behavior ( see section 4 below , and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggested that it was the x - ray afterglow of grb  001025a . in order to determine with certainty",
    "whether s1 was indeed the fading afterglow ( as opposed to a random , variable x - ray source such as an active galactic nucleus ) , we carried out a follow - up _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "this observation started on november  25 , 2002 , but had to be terminated because of high background radiation ; it was completed on april 23 , 2003 .",
    "the first observation has already been reported on in @xcite , but for the analysis presented here , we have made two improvements : we have omitted data taken during periods with high background , and we have analyzed data from the second and third epochs as well .",
    "the effective epic pn exposure times of the three _ xmm - newton _ observations , after screening out high background intervals , are 15  ks , 9  ks , and 18  ks respectively .    the data were processed and analysed with sas version 5.4.1 and xspec version 11.3 . periods with flares were identified based on the 1012  kev lightcurve of the full epic detector and events registered during these periods ( where the pn count rate was above 1.5 counts / s , and where the mos count rate was above 0.25 counts / s ) were filtered out . for the pn detector ,",

    "the decay of s1 is typical of x - ray afterglows having a decay index of @xmath46 @xcite . by extrapolating the best - fit pn lightcurve",
    "we predict the total number of counts in the second and third epoch _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations from s1 to be 0.04 counts and 0.02 counts , respectively ( i.e. , well below detectability ) .",
    "hence , the second and third epoch observations establish that s1 is a non - persistent source ; hence we identify s1 as the x - ray afterglow of grb  001025a .    in order to compare the x - ray afterglow to the prompt x - ray emission as observed by the rxte asm we extracted the pn 1.512  kev lightcurve .",
    "a power law fit to the 1.512  kev light curve is not well constrained ( decay index @xmath47 ) .",
    "hence , we extrapolated the best fit power law to the 0.312  kev light curve ( renormalized to the 1.512  kev flux level ) to the prompt emission phase .",
    "this extrapolation reproduces the rxte asm flux within the uncertainties ( see figure  [ xmm_lc ] ) .",
    "however , fitting a power law to the fading of the prompt emission in the 1.512  kev band yields a steep power law ( decay index @xmath48 ) underestimating the pn data points .",
    "such a steep decay has been reported in several early x - ray afterglows observed with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to fit a power law decay jointly to the fading prompt emission and the x - ray afterglow .",
    "the x - ray afterglow observed by _ xmm - newton _ is therefore not a simple continuation of the prompt emission .",
    "spectra of s1 were extracted from the first epoch observations and binned with a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "several spectral models were fitted to the pn and mos1 + 2 spectra simultaneously : ( i ) power law models , representing synchrotron emission from a population of relativistic electrons in the fireball @xcite , ( ii ) thermal plasma emission giving rise to x - ray emission lines as seen in several other grb afterglows @xcite ( the mekal model as is typically used to represent thermal emission * ? ? ?",

    "power law models indicate absorption in excess of galactic absorption , but the column density of extra - galactic absorbing material is not strongly constrained . in this model",
    "the burst redshift is unconstrained .",
    "an absorbed thermal plasma model ( mekal ) is as good a fit as the absorbed synchrotron emission model ( see table  [ mekal ] ) and implies a plasma temperature around 3  kev and a burst redshift around @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite favor a redshift in the range 0.51.2 from their mekal model fits , and we note that the thermal plasma could be outflowing resulting in a host galaxy redshift lower by @xmath52 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence , thermal emission models do not provide strong constraints on the burst redshift .",
    "the absorbing column density at the burst redshift is at most twice the galactic column density .",
    "the plasma abundances are not well constrained , but they are consistent with the solar values ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) .    naturally , a model with a combination of a synchrotron emission component and a thermal emission component ( see figure  [ xmmspec ] ) is also a good fit ( see table  [ plmekal ] ) .",
    "the relative normalization of the synchrotron emission component and the thermal emission component is not well constrained , but the synchrotron emission component contributes @xmath55 of the total flux and above @xmath23  kev the synchrotron emission component dominates . the best - fit photon index is lower than in the pure synchrotron emission model fits ( @xmath56 ) , but close to typical photon indices for x - ray afterglows @xcite .",

    "the @xmath1-band - to-3  kev spectral index is @xmath101 so grb  001025a is clearly dark according to the definition of @xcite . for grbs with detected optical afterglows ,",
    "the @xmath1-band - to-3  kev spectral index is @xmath102 and for _ swift _ detected bursts it is @xmath103 @xcite so the afterglow of grb  001025a is optically faint relative to the x - ray band .",
    "the low optical - to - x - ray spectral index could be due to heavy obscuration in the burst environment .",
    "alternatively , the cooling frequency could be close to the x - ray band , giving rise to a shallow spectral index requiring no optical obscuration .",
    "the x - ray spectral index has been measured only for a few dark grbs . by re - normalizing the x - ray spectrum and the optical observations to a common epoch ( e.g. 11  h after the burst ) and extrapolating the x - ray spectral index to the optical band , assuming a position of the cooling break , the @xmath1-band flux can be predicted . for three of the five grbs with measured spectral index in the dark grb sample of @xcite ( grb  990704 , grb  990806 , grb  000214 )",
    "the predicted @xmath1-band flux is lower than the observational upper limit , when invoking a cooling break at 1  kev .",
    "these three grbs have steep x - ray spectral indices , possibly reflecting the presence of a thermal component on top of the synchrotron emission .",
    "the true synchrotron spectral index may thus be lower than the index obtained from a pure synchrotron emission fit , giving rise to even lower predictions for the optical flux . for the remaining two grbs in the dark grb sample of @xcite ( grb  000210 and grb  001109 ) obscuration",
    "is required in order to bring the observational upper limit in line with the model prediction ( or the derived x - ray spectral index is too step due to the presence of thermal emission ) .",
    "two of the bursts detected by _ swift _ and with published x - ray spectral index ( grb  050401 and grb  050408 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are dark according to the definition of @xcite . for both bursts obscuration",
    "is required in order to be consistent with the upper limit on the @xmath1-band flux , even when invoking a cooling break at 1  kev .",
    "grb  001025a was a long - duration grb with a prompt emission spectrum well fitted by the band model .",
    "the tail of the prompt soft x - ray emission decays too steeply to be the beginning of the afterglow .",
    "three epoch _ xmm - newton _ observations show that the grb  001025a afterglow is x - ray faint .",
    "furthermore , the optical flux is relatively low compared to the x - ray band .",
    "either ( i ) the optical afterglow suffers extinction of at least seven magnitudes , or ( ii ) a significant fraction of the x - ray afterglow flux originates from a thermal plasma , and the cooling frequency is close to the x - ray band at 1.2  days after the burst . in the latter case",
    ", we predict that the burst redshift is around two , and we find that the x - ray luminosity and the spectral index are fairly typical of grb afterglows .",
    "alternatively , the grb  001025a x - ray afterglow spectrum is characterized by a very steep synchrotron index , and grb  001025a is situated in an environment with an unusually large gas - to - dust ratio , consistent with the galactic ratio .",
    "the present study of grb  001025a , and the properties of the few other dark grbs with measured spectral index , raises the possibility that some bursts appear optically dark because their afterglow is faint , and their cooling frequency is close to the x - ray band . the viability of this scenario can be tested from early observations of x - ray afterglows from dark grbs yielding the temporal and spectral behaviour of the x - ray afterglows , which in turn constrain the geometry of the blast wave and the underlying physical processes .",
    "this would provide a crucial test for physical differences between dark bursts and bursts with an optical afterglow .",
