    "in this work we make a step toward a complete solution ( yet to be achieved ) of the celebrated boltzmann - sinai ergodic hypothesis . the latter asserts @xcite that every system of @xmath0 hard balls on a torus of dimension @xmath1 is ergodic ( provided the trivial first integrals are eliminated ) .",
    "this model reduces to the motion of a billiard particle in a @xmath2-dimensional torus bouncing off @xmath3 cylindrical obstacles ( the billiard particle hits a cylinder whenever two balls collide ) .",
    "billiards with cylindrical walls belong to a more general category of semi - dispersing billiards , where a particle moves in a container with concave ( but not necessarily strictly concave ) boundaries .",
    "we remark that in the case @xmath4 the cylinders actually become spheres , i.e.  any system of @xmath5 hard balls reduces to a billiard particle in a torus with a spherical obstacle .",
    "such billiards belong to a more special class of dispersing billiards , where a particle moves in a container with strictly concave walls .    dispersing billiards",
    "are always completely hyperbolic and ergodic @xcite , but for semi - dispersing billiards this may not be true .",
    "for example , a billiard in a 3-torus with a single cylindrical wall has zero lyapunov exponents and is not ergodic ; on the other hand , 2 transversal cylindrical walls within a 3-torus ensure hyperbolicity and ergodicity @xcite . for the systems of @xmath6 hard balls , one has to carefully explore the geometry of the cylindrical walls in order to derive hyperbolicity and ergodicity .",
    "there are two complications in the study of hard balls ( or more generally , semi - dispersing billiards ) .",
    "one is caused by the _",
    "singularities _ of the dynamics ",
    "these happen during simultaneous multiple collisions of @xmath7 balls and during grazing ( tangential ) collisions . in the phase space ,",
    "singular points make submanifolds of codimension one . the other complication is caused by _ non - hyperbolicity _",
    "( i.e.  the existence of zero lyapunov exponents ) at some phase points .",
    "such points make various structures , ranging from smooth submanifolds to cantor - like subsets of the phase space .",
    "powerful techniques have been developed to handle these two complications separately ( singularities and non - hyperbolicity ) , but the combination of the two still presents an unmanageable situation .",
    "more precisely , if non - hyperbolic sets and singularities intersect in a subset of positive @xmath8$]-dimensional measure , then modern proofs of ergodicity stall . on the other hand , such substantial overlaps between singularities and non - hyperbolic sets appear very unlikely ( physically ) ; they are regarded as ` conspiracy ' .    to bypass this scenario in an early work , ya .",
    "sinai and n.  chernov @xcite _ assumed _ that almost every point on the singularity manifolds ( with respect to the intrinsic lebesgue measure ) was completely hyperbolic . under this assumption ( now referred to as chernov - sinai ansatz ) they proved the so - called local ergodic theorem ( also called ` fundamental theorem ' ) , which later became instrumental in the proofs of ergodicity for various billiards @xcite .",
    "it gives sufficient ( and easily verifiable ) conditions under which a phase point has an open neighborhood which belongs ( mod 0 ) to one ergodic component .",
    "a.  krmli , n.  simnyi and d.  szsz built upon the results of @xcite and established the ergodicity for systems of @xmath9 hard balls in any dimension @xcite and for @xmath10 hard balls in dimension @xmath11 @xcite ; in particular they verified chernov - sinai ansatz in these cases .",
    "however , their techniques could not be extended to @xmath12 .",
    "the situation called for novel approaches .",
    "a partial breakthrough was made by simnyi and szsz when they invoked ideas of algebraic geometry to rule out various ` conspiracies ' ( at least for generic systems of hard balls ) , which were in the way of proving hyperbolicity and ergodicity .",
    "precisely , they assumed that the balls had arbitrary masses @xmath13 ( but the same radius @xmath14 ) and proved @xcite complete hyperbolicity at a.e .",
    "phase point for generic vectors of ` external parameters ' @xmath15 ; the latter needed to avoid some exceptional submanifolds of codimension one in @xmath16 , which remained unspecified and unknown .",
    "later simny used @xcite the same approach to prove chernov - sinai ansatz and ergodicity for generic systems of hard balls ( in the above sense ) .",
    "he also established hyperbolicity for systems of hard balls of arbitrary masses @xcite .",
    "thus the boltzmann - sinai ergodic hypothesis is now proved for typical , or generic , systems of hard balls .",
    "this seems to be a comforting settlement in both topological and measure - theoretic senses , but it falls short of solving physically relevant problems , as there is no way to check whether any particular system of hard balls is ergodic or not .",
    "most notably , for the system of balls with all equal masses ( which lies in the foundation of statistical mechanics ) the ergodicity remains open .    in an attempt to extend his results to all gases of hard balls ( without exceptions ) , simanyi developed @xcite a new approach based on purely dynamical ( rather than algebro - geometric ) ideas ; this allowed him to derive ergodicity from chernov - sinai ansatz for all hard ball systems .",
    "thus the boltzmann - sinai hypothesis is now solved conditionally , modulo the ansatz .",
    "it remains to prove ansatz , or alternatively , derive local ergodic theorem without ansatz .",
    "( as a side remark , it is ironic that ansatz , which originally seemed to be just a convenient and temporary technical assumption , now remains the only unresolved issue in the whole picture . )    here we make another step toward a final solution of the classical ergodic hypothesis : we derive local ergodic theorem without ansatz for arbitrary semi - dispersing billiards in dimension two",
    ". our method does not yet apply to higher dimensions , but we are working on this .",
    "a planar ( two - dimensional ) billiard is a dynamical system where a point @xmath17 moves freely with unit velocity @xmath18 , @xmath19 , in a bounded connected domain @xmath20 or @xmath21 and reflects off its boundary @xmath22 by the rule [ v+v- ] v^+ = v^- - 2 n(q),v^- n(q ) where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the postcollisional and precollisional velocities , @xmath25 is the inward unit normal vector to @xmath22 at the collision point @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the scalar product in @xmath28 .    as usual",

    "whenever the particle hits a corner point @xmath26 , there are two normal vectors to @xmath22 , thus the rule gives two possible continuations ( two branches ) of the billiard trajectory .",
    "of course , this is an exceptional event ( a singularity , see below ) .",
    "a billiard table @xmath30 is semi - dispersing if every smooth component of @xmath22 is convex ( but not necessarily strictly convex ) inward . we also suppose that the set of inflection points @xmath26 ( where the curvature of @xmath22 vanishes ) is a finite union of straight line segments ( flat sides of @xmath30 ) and some isolated points . a simple example is a polygon with one or several convex ovals removed from its interior . in semi - dispersing billiards",
    ", collisions can not accumulate @xcite , i.e.  within any finite time period the particle experiences finitely many collisions , hence its trajectory is always well defined ( though it might be multiply defined , due to corner points ) .",
    "the phase space of the billiard system is a compact three dimensional manifold @xmath31 , and the billiard flow @xmath32 preserves a uniform measure @xmath33 on @xmath34 .",
    "the collision space @xmath35 consists of all postcollisional velocity vectors at reflection points .",
    "we define the first collision time @xmath36 and the ( first ) collision map @xmath37 that maps @xmath34 onto @xmath38 ; its restriction to @xmath38 is called the billiard map ( or collision map ) .",
    "canonical coordinates on @xmath38 are @xmath14 and @xmath39 , where @xmath14 is the arc length parameter on @xmath22 and @xmath40 $ ] is the angle between @xmath18 and @xmath25 . the map @xmath41 preserves the smooth measure @xmath42 .    for every @xmath43 we put @xmath44 ; similarly for every @xmath45 we put @xmath46 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are related by ( [ v+v- ] ) .",

    "now it is clear that @xmath52 .",

    "similarly , for each @xmath61 the singularity set @xmath62 ( which is part of the singularity set of the iterate @xmath63 ) is a finite union of smooth compact curves in @xmath38 .    in semi - dispersing billiards , the set @xmath64",
    "consists of increasing curves for @xmath65 and of decreasing curves for @xmath66 ; thus singularity curves always intersect each other transversally at some time in their lives .",
    "points @xmath67 whose trajectories are singular in both future and past ( the so called ` double - singularities ' ) make a countable set , which can be easily neglected in the studies of ergodic properties of @xmath56 .",
    "accordingly , the singularities of the flow @xmath53 are a countable union of hypersurfaces in @xmath34 , and future singularities intersect past singularities transversally .",

    "this phenomenon can only happen if the collision of @xmath233 takes place very close to a corner of the configuration space @xmath234 , and very soon after this collision the orbit segment @xmath235 $ ] flies near a tangency , so that no matter how small @xmath232 one chooses , the endpoint @xmath187 of @xmath181 ( other than @xmath236 ) is always a pre - tangency phase point , see fig .",
    "2 . in this case",
    "the proof can proceed with such a @xmath181 and @xmath187 as follows :    the forward orbit of the pre - tangency phase point @xmath237 touches @xmath238 at @xmath239 .",

    "it is clear from the picture that the forward orbit of @xmath227 enters the trip @xmath243 soon after time zero .",
    "furthermore , this forward orbit is bound to stay in @xmath243 until it reaches @xmath89 by the same reasoning as before : both pairs @xmath244 and @xmath245 can be embedded in a divergent lom by lemma 1 , thus the footpoints @xmath246 of @xmath247 ( @xmath248 , @xmath247 is in the closure of the strip @xmath243 ) can not be equal to any of the footpoints @xmath249 or @xmath250 ( @xmath251 ) , so the forward orbit of @xmath227 is unable to escape from the strip @xmath243 .",
    "since reaching the neighborhood @xmath89 with its forward orbit , the phase point @xmath227 proves to be future sufficient .",
    "now , with the above constructions , we are ready to complete the proof of the tail bound ( [ tail ] ) .",
