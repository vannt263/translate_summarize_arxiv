    "our knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing parameters has been rapidly improving in the past few years . we know that the neutrino flavors @xmath2 and @xmath3 mix among themselves , and we already have measured the mass squared differences and two of the three mixing angles to a good accuracy @xcite@xcite . the most important unknowns are the value of the third mixing angle , whether the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal or inverted , and the magnitude of the leptonic cp violation .",
    "the neutrino spectra from a core collapse supernova ( sn ) can shed light on the first two of these unknowns .",
    "neutrinos produced inside a sn core undergo oscillations on their way out through the mantle and envelope of the star , through the interstellar space , and possibly even through some part of the earth before arriving at the detector .",
    "the spectra of these neutrinos carry information about the two mass squared differences and the @xmath4 flavor component in the three mass eigenstates .",
    "of course this information comes convoluted with the primary fluxes of the neutrinos produced inside the star , and the extraction of the oscillation parameters depends crucially on our understanding of these primary fluxes .",
    "the uncertainties in the calculations of the primary flux spectra remain large , so only some of the robust features of these spectra can be used with confidence to extract the mixing parameters .",
    "even with this limitation , it has been argued @xcite that the observations of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra at the detectors on earth may reveal the type of the neutrino mass hierarchy and imply a range for the third mixing angle .",
    "significant modifications of neutrino spectra can take place if the neutrinos travel through the earth matter before reaching the detector , and these earth effects can provide perhaps the most concrete signatures for some of the neutrino mixing scenarios @xcite .",
    "any signature of neutrino oscillations depends on the flavor - dependent differences between the primary spectra .",
    "recent studies @xcite reveal that these differences are much smaller than had been assumed before .",
    "this makes the identification of earth effects harder than that expected in the previous analyses , and one needs to reevaluate the potential of the detectors from the perspective of these `` pessimistic '' assumptions about the primary fluxes and spectra .    the comparison of the neutrino signals observed at two detectors would be the most efficient way of detecting the earth effects .",
    "however the detectors need to be sufficiently far apart so that the earth effects are different for both of them , and sufficiently large to observe a statistically significant signal .",
    "currently super - kamiokande is the only large detector that can measure the neutrino energies and can detect more than a few thousands of events from a galactic sn .",
    "though two detectors , both capable of measuring the neutrino energies , is definitely the most desirable option , it is still possible to detect earth effects without having to measure the energies of individual neutrinos .",
    "indeed , it has recently been shown that for a galactic sn , the comparison of the number of cherenkov photons detected at super - kamiokande and icecube as a function of time may be able to identify the earth effects @xcite .",
    "the location of the sn can be anywhere within a specific 70% region of the sky for the effects to be observable .",
    "the motivations to look for a way to identify the earth effects at a single detector are manifold , the cancellation of systematic uncertainties being the major one .",
    "moreover , in conjunction with the two - detector signature mentioned above , the fraction of the sky for a favorable location of the sn increases to about 85% when super - kamiokande is also employed as the `` single '' detector . for nearly 35% of the sky fraction for the sn location , these two ways of detecting the earth effects act as confirmatory tests of each other .",
    "the ranges of primary neutrino flux parameters that give an earth effect signature through these two procedures also differs slightly , since the two - detector method involving icecube relies on the measurement of integrated luminosity , whereas the one - detector method relies on the analysis of the spectral shape . in this sense ,",
    "the two methods are complementary to each other .",
    "the naive method of fitting the observed neutrino signal for the primary fluxes and neutrino mixing parameters is inefficient for several reasons .",
    "the primary fluxes  their average energies , spectral widths as well as the magnitude of the total fluxes  are time dependent , and only a few rough features can be said to be known with any confidence .",
    "one may try to get rid of the time dependence by dividing the signal into several time bins , but this reduces the available statistics . even within each time bin ,",
    "one typically has to fit for as many as 5 parameters of the primary spectra , not counting the uncertainties in the neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "however , robust identification of earth effects can be achieved by observing that the parameters that govern the oscillation frequency of the neutrinos inside the earth are relatively well measured , and more importantly , completely independent of the primary neutrino spectra .",
    "therefore , the earth effects can be identified merely by identifying the presence of this oscillation frequency in the observed spectrum .",
    "the oscillation frequency does not change with time , thus obviating the need for several time bins .",
    "this oscillating component is expected to be a small addition to the otherwise approximately blackbody spectrum that forms the major component of the signal . in order to extract this small oscillation component",
    ", we propose a fourier analysis of the spectrum , which can separate the signals of different frequency from their superposition .",
    "we perform a numerical simulation to explore the efficiency of this method at a water cherenkov detector like super - kamiokande , and a large scintillation detector like the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has a much better energy resolution .",
    "since the earth effects can be observed only for certain neutrino mixing scenarios , the mere identification of these effects can already tell us whether , for example , the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal .",
    "this is a daunting task even at the future long - baseline experiments .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the earth effects as a function of time gives us important information about the primary neutrino spectra that is extremely useful for understanding the sn dynamics .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "as may be observed , the earth effect peak is cleanly isolated from the dominant contribution .",
    "the figure also allows us to put a lower bound on the value of @xmath72 for which the earth effects will be detectable : if @xmath79 , the earth effect peak will be lost in the dominant low frequency peak . physically speaking",
    ", this implies that the neutrinos have to travel a minimum distance through the earth for the earth effects to be detectable .",
    "so this is not a limitation of this particular method , but a general limitation on the identification of earth effects .",
    "the earth effect peak has a finite width due to the finite @xmath70-dependence of the coefficient of the oscillating term @xmath71 , and of @xmath80 .",

    "the power spectrum of the fourier transform @xmath83 of this envelope is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : earthterm](b ) . since @xmath84 is the coefficient of the earth matter oscillations term @xmath85 and @xmath72 is nearly constant over all the energy range , the width of the earth effect peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff](a ) is due mainly to the width of @xmath83 .",
    "we parameterize this width by @xmath86 , defined as the value of @xmath75 where @xmath83 is half its maximum value .",

    "[ fig : cutoff](a ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : earthterm](b ) , we observe @xmath88 .",
    "the value of @xmath86 depends on the primary fluxes , but it is in the range of 3 - 10 for almost all the allowed parameter range .",
    "the exact value of @xmath86 is not crucial for this analysis , however this estimation is useful in two ways .",
    "it allows us to get rid of spurious peaks by applying a selection criterion of a minimum width of the peak , and it also gives us the maximum range of @xmath75-values around the mean @xmath72 for which the earth effect term contributes .",
    "the neutrino detectors have an energy threshold of about 510 mev , which corresponds to @xmath89 1.252.5 .",
    "although the number of events below this energy threshold is expected to be very small ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ey ] ) , the presence of a sharp threshold may introduce high frequency components in the @xmath70-spectrum .",
    "although the threshold is not sharp in real life , we show an extreme example of the effect of a sharp threshold in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff](b ) , taking a threshold of 10 mev .",
    "since the fourier transform of a step function is a series of equispaced frequencies , we observe that these high equispaced frequencies are superposed on top of the actual @xmath76 .",
    "the spacing between these frequencies is much smaller than the width of the earth effect peak , so the observation of the peak and the area under the peak are not much affected , even in this extreme situation . in reality , the energy threshold is expected to be much smoother and should not affect the identification of the peak and the measurement of its strength . in all the numerical simulations henceforth , we introduce a sharp energy threshold of 5 mev in order to take care of the threshold effects .      since the spectrum is observed as a discrete set of neutrinos with individual energies ( and hence , individual @xmath70 values )",
    ", we have to approximate @xmath90 by the discrete sum g(k ) = _ events e^i k y  , [ ft - discrete ] where @xmath91 is the total number of events .",
    "the statistical fluctuations in the spectrum can contribute to frequency components that are comparable to @xmath72 .",
    "this acts as a background for the actual earth effect peak .",
    "the magnitude of this background can be estimated by assuming that the distribution of @xmath92 is completely random .",
    "this is definitely a good approximation for large values of @xmath75 independent of the details of the distribution of @xmath70 . in this approximation ,",
    "the sum in ( [ ft - discrete ] ) above represents a two dimensional random walk with unit step .",
    "this implies that the value of @xmath93 obeys an exponential distribution @xmath94 , which has a mean @xmath95 and variance @xmath96 independent of the number of events @xmath91 .",
    "the background due to the statistical fluctuations is thus nearly 1.0 on average , and the `` signal '' of the peak should rise above this average level in order to be identified .",
    "this is illustrated in fig  [ fig : discrete](a ) , where the distance travelled by the neutrinos through the earth is @xmath97 .",
    "note that the low frequency background is dominant for @xmath98 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : discrete](b ) , we show the same neutrino signal , but now with @xmath99 .",
    "the earth effect peak stands out above the background . though the level of the background is not affected by the number of events , the magnitude of the signal grows proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "clearly , the earth effect peak would grow above the background level when the number of events is sufficiently high .",
    "although the peak identification may be possible `` by eye '' in many cases , as in fig  [ fig : discrete](a ) , the standard particle physics method of resonance identification may be employed for the task .",
    "firstly , we apply a lower @xmath75-cut to cut away all @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the value of @xmath75 where the dominant peak falls to the background level . in fig",
    "[ fig : discrete](a ) , for example , @xmath102 .",
    "although we have made a rough estimate of the background above , the actual background may be calculated by averaging the spectrum @xmath93 away from the value @xmath72 , i.e. in the region where we do not expect the earth effect peak .    we know from fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] that the half width at half maximum of the peak in @xmath75 should be @xmath103@xmath104 .",
    "we then expect that most of the earth effects contribute to values of @xmath75 within a range of @xmath105 around the peak , where @xmath105 may be taken to be @xmath106 , for example .",
    "we can then choose any interval in @xmath75 with a range of @xmath105 , and integrate the power spectrum within this range . applying the central limit theorem to the background distribution @xmath107 , we can estimate the integral of the background within this interval to be @xmath108 . for @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ,",
    "we get @xmath112 .",
    "this implies that @xmath113 , for example , would correspond to a more than @xmath114 detection of a positive signal .",
    "depending on the actual data , the value of @xmath105 may be optimized .",
    "the procedure of measuring the area under the peak is more efficient than just measuring the peak height since it can weed out the spurious high peaks that do not have the minimum width dictated by @xmath83 .",
    "the number of events needed in order to see the signal above the background depends strongly on the primary neutrino spectra , since the coefficient of the earth effect term depends on @xmath115 . in fig .",

    "actually the density may vary by as much as 30% along the neutrino trajectory in the extreme case where the trajectory is nearly tangent to the core . since @xmath147 , this density variation contributes to the energy dependence of @xmath80 through the term involving @xmath148 in ( [ dmbar - def ] ) , and smears the earth effect peak .",

    "we take the inverse beta decay process to be completely elastic , so that the differential cross section involves a @xmath162 function nonvanishing only at @xmath163 $ ] , where @xmath164 is the proton mass .",
    "the angular distribution is approximated to be isotropic , and the cross section proportional to @xmath165 .",
    "this corresponds to the differential cross section in @xcite in the limit of degenerate neutron and proton masses , vanishing electron mass , and isotropic angular distribution .",
    "these approximations made here retain the essential features of the observed spectra .",
    "we finally normalize @xmath166 to the number of events using @xmath167 .",
    "the outgoing positrons are detected in the water cherenkov detectors through the cherenkov photons that they radiate . in the scintillation detectors",
    ", the positrons are detected through photons produced in the scintillation material . since",
    "a larger number of photons can be produced in a scintillation detector , these have typically a much better energy resolution than the water cherenkov detectors .",
    "indeed , whereas at super - kamiokande we have @xmath168  mev  @xmath169  mev@xmath170 @xcite , the energy resolution of a scintillation detector may be as good as @xmath171  mev  @xmath169  mev@xmath170 @xcite , which is more than a factor of 5 better .",
    "since the identification of earth effects as described in this paper relies on the detection of the modulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ey ] ) , and the finite energy resolution tends to smear them out , it is clear that the energy resolution plays a crucial role in the efficiency of detecting earth effects . to illustrate this , we show in fig .",
    "[ compare - sksc ] the same energy spectrum of the signals as observed at a scintillation and a cherenkov detector .",
    "one can clearly see how the poor energy resolution of the cherenkov detector smears out the modulations .",
    "the difference between figs .",
    "[ compare - sksc](a ) and ( b ) is reflected in the number of events required for the signal to rise above the background at the two detectors .",
    "a numerical simulation that generates inverse beta decay events in each of the detectors illustrates the comparative efficiency of the fourier analyses at these two detectors . in fig .",
    "[ fourier-2000 ] , we show the fourier transforms of the spectra at these two detectors with 2000 events each .",
    "whereas the peak can be identified even by eye at the scintillation detector , the fourier power spectrum at the cherenkov detector is indistinguishable from background .    in fig  [ fourier-2000](a )",
    ", the area under the peak is around 80 .",
    "since the area under the peak grows nearly linearly with the number of events , this indicates that at a scintillation detector , the signal starts becoming visible at around @xmath172 . at the proposed 50 kiloton scintillation detector lena @xcite for example ,",
    "one expects about 13,000 events from a sn at 10 kpc .",
    "this is an order of magnitude more than the statistics required for identifying the earth effects .",
    "indeed , a much smaller scintillation detector may be sufficient for this purpose .    at a water cherenkov detector ,",
    "the energy resolution is poor compared to a scintillation one .",
    "indeed , the energy resolution is of nearly the same size as the wavelength of the earth effect modulations for @xmath173 .",
    "it is therefore much harder to identify the modulations . in fig .",
    "[ sk-100k](a ) , we show the fourier transform of the @xmath70-spectra generated at a cherenkov detector with 100,000 events .",
    "we expect that we need more than 60,000 events to be able to identify the peak unambiguously .",
    "this indicates that super - kamiokande may be too small for detecting the earth effects by itself in this parameter range .",
    "however the proposed hyper - kamiokande would have the required size .",
    "if the modulation wavelength is larger than the energy resolution , which is the case for low @xmath72 , the peak is easier to detect .",
    "in addition , if the differences in the primary spectra of @xmath6 and @xmath29 are larger than those taken in this paper till now , the peak identification can be achieved with a much smaller number of events . in fig .",
    "[ sk-100k](b ) , we show the power spectrum with the average energies of the primary spectra differing by 40% , and the value of @xmath62 decreased to 4000 km . in such a `` favorable '' range , even a few thousand events would be enough at a water cherenkov detector , so that super - kamiokande has a chance of performing a successful earth effect detection .",
    "however in the light of the latest calculations of sn spectra , such a large energy difference is basically ruled out .",
    "note that even for a scintillation detector , the energy resolution becomes comparable to the modulation wavelength for large @xmath72 values , so the number of events required will increase with @xmath72 . at values of @xmath174 ,",
    "the modulations get significantly washed out even at a scintillation detector .",
    "the modulations introduced in the neutrino spectrum by the earth matter effects provide a way of detecting the presence of these effects without prior assumptions about the flavor - dependent source spectra .",
    "we have demonstrated that a fourier analysis of the inverse - energy spectrum of the @xmath6 signal may reveal a peak corresponding to the neutrino oscillation frequency in earth .",
    "the position of this peak is insensitive to the primary spectra , and depends only on @xmath1 and the distance travelled through the earth .",
    "we study the feasibility of the identification of this peak .",
    "the number of events required for an unambiguous identification depends crucially on the energy resolution of the detector .",
    "the task is certainly feasible at a large water cherenkov detector like hyper - kamiokande that can detect nearly @xmath175 events from a galactic sn .",
    "however , scintillation detectors generically have a much better energy resolution than the cherenkov ones , and typically a scintillation detector can detect the earth effects with only about 2000 events .",
    "this indicates that a scintillation detector large enough to detect a few thousand events from a galactic sn is highly desirable .",
    "the identification of the earth effects severely restricts the neutrino mixing parameter space , since the effects are present only with certain combinations of the neutrino mass hierarchy and the mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath45 is measured at a laboratory experiment to be greater than @xmath50 , then the earth effects on the @xmath6 spectrum imply the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "however if the earth effects are not detected , it does not rule out any neutrino mixing parameters , owing to the current uncertainties in the primary fluxes .",
    "a galactic sn is a rare event , expected to occur only a few times per century .",
    "however this time scale should be compared with that of those laboratory experiments which would be sensitive to the mass hierarchy and values of @xmath45 as low as @xmath50 .",
    "determination of these two quantities is a difficult challenge even for the experiments that may be running in the next few decades @xcite .",
    "if a sn is observed within the next decade , the information gained may even be useful in fine - tuning the design parameters of these experiments .",
    "the fourier analysis described in this paper also yields the value of @xmath1 to a good accuracy if the matter effects are identified . though kamland should pin down @xmath1 to within a few percent in the next few years",
    ", a galactic sn will provide a completely independent confirmatory test of this value . for large values of @xmath1 and @xmath62 ,",
    "the accuracy in @xmath1 through the sn spectral analysis becomes comparable with kamland .",
    "models of sne generically predict time variations in the neutrino flux spectra and hence in the magnitude of earth effects . the relative strength of the detected earth effects as a function of time thus provides a test for these models .    in order to reap the benefits of the earth effects , the detector needs to be shadowed by the earth from the sn .",
    "the probability of such an occurrence is increased by having more than one detector spaced far apart from each other . from the point of view of sn neutrinos ,",
    "several `` small '' ( a few kiloton ) scintillation detectors at different locations are far more useful than a single large one .",
