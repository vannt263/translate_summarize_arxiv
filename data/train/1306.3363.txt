    "the discord @xcite is a measure of quantum correlations which are responsible for the effective work of quantum devices and give them significant advantages over their classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "calculations of the discord constitute a very laborious optimization problem . as a result",
    ", the discord problem has been solved for two - qubit systems @xcite and some simplest three - qubit systems @xcite only . in the present work we study the quantum discord in bipartite many - qubit systems .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is widely used for experimental realization of quantum algorithms in spin systems with a small number of qubits @xcite .",
    "untill recently entanglement was used as a sole measure of quantum correlations .",
    "entanglement is small in liquid - state nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "so it seemed that the nmr methods were not promising for quantum information processing in many - qubit systems .",
    "a negative evaluation of nmr methods has changed after it was understood that the quantum discord describes all quantum correlations whereas entanglement describes only a part of them .",
    "discord can be significant in nuclear spin systems but is not well understood quantitatively yet .",
    "thus , methods of discord calculation in many - qubit systems became an important problem now , in particular , in the nmr context .",
    "we consider a homogeneous chain of nuclear spins ( @xmath0 ) coupled by the dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) in a strong external magnetic field . we will call it subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "subsystem @xmath1 interacts with an impurity spin @xmath2 ( subsystem @xmath3 , fig.1 ) .     the many - spin system for the investigation of the discord .",
    "subsystem @xmath1 is a linear chain of spins coupled by the ddi .",
    "the impurity spin , connected with the chain spins by @xmath4- interactions , represents subsystem @xmath3 . ]    in the initial moment of time the system is in the thermodynamic equilibrium state with the density matrix @xmath5 where @xmath6 points in the direction of the magnetic field which is perpendicular to the plane of fig.1 ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the @xmath6- projections of the @xmath10-th chain spin and the impurity spin ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the larmour frequencies ; @xmath13 is proportional to the inverse temperature of the system and @xmath14 is the partition function . applying resonance ( for spins @xmath15 and @xmath2 ) @xmath16- radiofrequency pulses of the magnetic field around the axis @xmath17 in the rotating reference frame @xcite we create conditions for the emergence of quantum correlations in the course of the evolution of the spin system .",
    "formally such initiating pulses lead to the replacement of the operators @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the expression for the density matrix ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath21 . here",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath22 describes the ddi in the spin chain ( subsystem @xmath1 ) and is determined by the secular part of the ddi as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the chain spins ; @xmath25 is the ddi coupling constants of spins @xmath10 and @xmath26 ; @xmath27 . in turn",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath28 characterizes the interaction between subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "it equals @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the coupling constant of the chain spin @xmath10 with the inpurity spin which has a different gyromagnetic ratio from the chain spins .",
    "one can find one - dimensional chains of nuclear spins coupled with the ddi , for example , in calcium hydroxyapatite @xmath31 ( chains of hydroxyl protons ) and in calcium fluorapatite @xmath32 ( chains of fluorine nuclei ) @xcite . in those substances the distances between neighboring parallel chains is three times greater than the distance between nearest neighbors in the chains @xcite .",
    "this circumstance is a motivation for the model of the isolated spin chain @xcite coupled with the spins of impurity nuclei .",
    "the evolution of the density matrix in the described model can be investigated by nmr methods @xcite .",
    "it yields ways for discord measurements in solids .",
    "in particular , nmr quantum state tomography @xcite can be used .",
    "the suggested model can be considered as a theoretical bases for the interpretation of the results of these experiments .",
    "first we consider a case where subsystem @xmath1 contains only two spins .",
    "it is suitable to rewrite the initial density matrix after applying @xmath16- radiofrequency pulses as    @xmath33\\left[\\cosh{\\frac{\\beta\\omega_b}{2}}+2\\sinh{(\\frac{\\beta\\omega_b}{2})}s_x\\right],\\label{eq:4 }        \\end{array}\\ ] ]    @xmath34    one can find from the symmetry of the system ( see fig.1 ) that the hamiltonians @xmath22 and @xmath28 commute .",
    "thus , subsystem @xmath1 is only subject to dipolar evolution . since",
    "a unitary local transformation does not change the discord , we can ignore dipolar evolution of subsystem @xmath1 . assuming that @xmath35 one can find    @xmath36s_x\\\\ + ( i_{1z}+i_{2z})s_y\\sin{(gt)},\\label{eq:5 }        \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the evolution time .",

    "\\label{eq:13 }        \\end{array}\\ ] ]    we use the entropy @xmath51 $ ] at the initial moment of time because it is sufficient for the calculation of the discord ( see below ) .",
    "according to the standard approach @xcite , one performs a total set of projective measurements over one - qubit subsystem @xmath3 @xmath52 after the measurements , one can find that the whole system is then described by the ensemble of the states @xmath53 : @xmath54 @xmath55\\pm \\frac{z_2}{2}\\big[2\\sinh{(\\frac{\\beta\\omega_b}{2})}\\sin(gt)ai_z\\\\ + i\\sinh{(\\frac{\\beta\\omega_b}{2})}b\\big(\\cos^2{(\\frac{gt}{2})}-4\\sin^2(\\frac{gt}{2})i_{1z}i_{2z}\\big)\\big]\\big\\ } , \\,\\,(k=0 , 1 ) , \\label{eq:15 }        \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath56 characterize different unitary transformations used at the minimization of the entropy after measurements over subsystem @xmath3 .",
    "these parameters should be found from the minimization of the entropy of the system after the measurements , @xmath57 , which is determined by @xcite : @xmath58     the dependence of the conditional entropy @xmath57 in the three - qubit system on the parameters @xmath59 , used at the minimization @xcite at different moments of the evolution time @xmath37 : ( a ) @xmath60 ms , ( b ) @xmath61 ms , ( c ) @xmath62 ms . the coupling constant of the @xmath4- interactions @xmath63 . ]",
    "we performed a numerical calculation of the conditional entropy @xmath57 at different moments as a function of the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( fig.2 ) .",

    "at @xmath66 in ( [ eq:15 ] ) one can find that the matrices @xmath68 do not depend on time .",
    "it means that the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath69 which determine the conditional entropy @xmath57 do not depend on time too .",
    "further we consider the matrices @xmath70 setting @xmath71 in eq .",
